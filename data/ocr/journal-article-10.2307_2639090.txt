Peter Laslett's remark of I956 is well known. His lament was echoed in I962 in Bernard Crick's extended plea In defence of politics. They surveyed a wasteland laid bare by a sociology which announced the exhaustion of political ideals, and a philosophy, logical positivism, which declared that nothing significant could be said about ethics or politics. According to Laslett, one of the original culprits of the former kind was Karl Mannheim, because he had taught that all thinking and all knowing were sociologically determined.' Mannheim will be important in surveying the books under review, since his Ideology and utopia (I929) not only laid the foundations for modern scholarship on utopian thought, but also, in elaborating the concept of' the sociology of knowledge', contributed an influential methodology for the study of the history of ideas. I shall mainly be concerned with two new studies of utopianism, by Frank and Fritzie Manuel, and by J. C. Davis, and with the work of three historians, John Dunn, J. G. A. Pocock and Richard Ashcraft, who hold distinctive and divergent views about the proper way to write the history of ideas, views especially apparent in their accounts of Locke's theory of obligation. Ashcraft is a modern disciple of Mannheim; Dunn and Pocock emphatically are not. I shall start by commenting on the current state of methodological play, then turn to see what light these reflexions throw on Locke studies, move on to early modern utopianism, and conclude by looking at the transition, in Dunn's work, from the study of Locke to the problems of constructing political philosophy today. John Dunn and Quentin Skinner, to whom Laslett was mentor in the early I 96os, together with John Pocock, began in the late I96os to construct a methodology which, they believed, could offer a genuinely historical study of past ideas.2 Dunn's contribution, 'The identity of the history of ideas' (I968), is now reprinted in his collection of essays, Political obligation in its historical context.3 The proper task of intellectual history was seen to be the study of the way concepts have been put to practical use at particular historical moments. Texts, or any utterances, J. L. Austin's 'speech acts',4 were to be construed not merely as disembodied * For their criticism of an earlier draft of this article I am most grateful to David Leiberman, Christine MacLeod and Sylvana Tomaselli.

Texts could only be understood by uncovering authorial intentions, and by extensive investigation of the political languages available to contemporaries. At its simplest, this method offered a via media between idealist and realist approaches: between the anti- historical view that the classic texts were timeless reflexions upon perennial conceptual questions, and the antiphilosophical view that texts were epiphenomenal, causally anchored in social, economic or psychological circumstances. There is a remarkable paradox in the career of what John Gunnell has called 'the new history of political thought ',,5 for it has been accused by both methodological wings of collaboration with the enemy. At its inception, the method was chiefly read as predominantly hostile to a philosopher's history of thought and as defending the claims of context against text. It was accused of nothing short of determinism. Thus Charles Tarlton in I973: There is a kind of determinism which considers the relation between linguistic acts [i.e. texts] and their settings such as that the act derives from the setting. The meaning of the act is merely extracted from the surrounding complex of social and political relationships. Expression, it is thought, merely reflects an underlying and somehow more real world of non-linguistic activity, and always appears strapped essentially to things like class interests or particular controversy. The difference between this sort of determinism and Pocock's, Skinner's and Dunn's strategies for locating meaning definitively in an historical situation are of degree only. Similarly, Parekh and Berki held the newly proposed method to be a ' reductionism' and an ' epochal determinism'. They put in a plea in defence of philosophy and the 'universal human predicament'. Hobbes, after all, 'was big enough of a... philo- sopher to want, and to be able, to rise above his own historical particularity'. The reductio of this judgement is Philip Corrigan's recent remark that Skinner and Christopher Hill have produced an 'intellectually respectable materialist history of political philosophy '.6 Recently, similar criticism has come from a different stance, more familiar in literary studies, which seeks to stress the subjective responses of the reader of texts. The claim has been made, by La Capra, that Skinner's method is reductive because it adopts the 'extreme belief' that 'utterances and, presumably by extension, the text derive their meaning from the author's intention in writing them' - where authorial intention is recoverable from non-textual historical investigation. The mistake is held to be that this ' tends to assume a proprietory relation between the author and the text', whereas 'tradition "expropriates" the author', for the texts of the tradition 'have entered the " public domain"'. In other words, the method is criticized for an excessively positivist presumption that the meaning of the text can be historically decoded irrespective of the subjectivity of the reader, the interpreter- historian. The same criticism is levelled by Gunnell, for whom the attempt to avoid reader subjectivity is neither plausible nor legitimate. Gunnell, La Capra, and now, in modified form, Martyn Thompson, appeal instead for a ' reader-centred ' orientation, which takes seriously the present subjective effort of the interpreter. 5 J. G.

According to Ashcraft, Skinner and Pocock are too narrowly philosophical in their emphasis upon languages and textual understanding. What makes political theory political is 'not the philosophical cogency' nor the 'textual consistency' of a work, but its relevance 'to an existent political movement'. The failure to attend to the 'actual social and historical conditions' of texts produces a 'sterilized characterization of political life'. Here, the linguistic contextualists, as I shall call them, stand condemned for presenting merely an elaborate version of old-fashioned textualism, a narrowly ideational way of explaining what texts meant.8 In a new article, Ashcraft reveals his debt to Mannheim.9 The social thought of Mannheim inherited several legacies: from Marx he took his historical and class analysis, from Weber his preoccupation with the relationship between consciousness and social reality, and from Freud the disclosure of unconscious motivation. Ideology and utopia is an ambiguous book, but in the last resort it is doubtful whether Mannheim believed in the autonomy of an individual's rational thought processes. Hence Laslett's admonishing of Mannheim in I956. Ashcraft explains that, for Mannheim, to analyse a text is to seek not the coherence of an argument, but the mode or structure of thought, and its correspondence to the social phenomena from which it emerged. It is necessary to disclose the 'existential determination' of an author's thought. The production of ideas occurs in relation to 'definite social strata struggling for ascendancy'. Any interpretation based purely on the relationship of a text to previous or contemporary thought was 'internalist', idealist, a neo-Kantian naivety.'0 Political thought inhabited two constellations: ideologies, which are fictions designed to rationalize existing realities, and utopias, fantasies designed to envision new conditions. Mannheim found the outlook depressing: political theory either consecrated the dismal present, or invented unrealizable idylls. That a theoretical utterance could be objectively true or prescriptively valid seemed to be precluded. One aspect of Mannheim's thesis which Ashcraft finds particularly appealing is the concept of intellectual authorship as a ' collective activity'. Part of the neo-Kantian mistake is to envisage Western political thought as 'a discrete series of attempts by a few individuals to express transcendental or objective truths'. Texts of course are written by individuals, but authors must be seen as concrete and social individuals within contexts of collective action. For Mannheim social life is subject to forces exerted by the contests of classes, which determine the place of individuals I D.

Cognitions and utterances are dependent upon determinant social configurations. I suspect that Ashcraft's brand of criticism of the linguistic contextualists, if not in such strident form, will in future be heard more frequently than the earlier and opposite suggestion that they have produced a 'determinist' history of ideas. This is because the critics have hitherto addressed themselves to methodological papers. We now have a number of books of substantive historical research which fly under the method's flag. These books should of course be the direct fruition of the proposed method, and so they are, yet their effect is to throw some features of the new method into sharper relief. Skinner's Foundations of modern political thought (I 978) does not shy from speaking of thought as 'ideology', or of rational self- or group-interest, in locating the intentions of past authors in the midst of political battles, yet its analysis is conducted in terms of the identification of polemical manceuvres within traditions of political discourse. Similarly, Pocock's Machiavellian moment (I975) is essentially a book about political languages. The historical agents are players of language games. The contextual effort is not primarily one of identifying economic interests, or affective political connexions, or psychic motivations, but the recovery oflinguistic conventions. Whereas almost all varieties of historical 'realism ' in the history of ideas stem from the inspiration of sociological traditions, here it is not Marx or Weber, Mannheim or Pareto, but the linguistic philosophers Wittgenstein, Grice and Austin who provide the spirit of the inquiry. This is no surprise. It is what the methodology promised: 'the appropriate focus of study is ... essentially linguistic'." Yet some practitioners of the history of ideas, more closely wedded to sociological traditions, or perhaps to Namier's version of realism, will feel that the notion of context here is too restrictive, that satisfactory historical explanation is not exhausted by recovering language games. The new approach may especially be arraigned for being excessively rationalist in its stress on the more or less self-conscious activities of agents operating within linguistic (and hence moral and philosophical) conventions, and for failing thereby to attend to the irrational, affective and subconscious in human motivation. Holists will also feel that it is too individualist in its stress on agency and its neglect of the role of institutions or classes. At this point, it is worth emphasizing a crucial injunction of the linguistic contextualists. Any historical explanation, to be valid, must be formulated, Skinner insists, 'in terms that could in principle have made sense to the agent himself' 12 This is not quite the position of extreme generosity to the agent of the hermeneutic or verstehen tradition - one thinks of Dilthey and Collingwood - in which the task is merely to listen to, rethink the thoughts, and understand an agent's self-description. But the emphasis is upon understanding rather than upon explaining via causal conditions.'3 I say this, despite the mediation conducted by Skinner in his paper, "'Social 11 Q Skinner, 'Meaning and understanding in the history of ideas', History and Theory, viii (I969), 49. 12 Ibid. pp. 28-9.

His injunction to provide an explanation which would 'in principle' have made sense to the agent, is to demand of the historian a more energetic inquiry into historical circumstances than merely to listen to (aiid perhaps be fooled by) the agent. None the less, it surely precludes many types of realist explanation, daily meted out by historians, which agents could not possibly have understood, let alone accepted, as accounts of what they were doing. As the title of Skinner's paper suggests, this debate is not only about the discipline of the history of ideas, but is central to the quarrel about the status of social science, where those who deploy a natural science notion of causality do battle with those who insist that the human studies have an autonomous method based upon understanding the meanings of rational agents. One of Dunn's essays, 'Practising history and social science on realist assumptions', reprinted in his collection,'5 is characteristically sensitive to the methodological pitfalls of both the hermeneutical and realist positions. While hostile to behavioural science, he keenly points out the dangers of analytical flaccidity in the verstehen approach. 'Rethinking the thoughts' manifestly is impossible, and here he invokes, against Collingwood, Quine's doubts about our ability to translate perceived behaviour into agents' intentionality. Moreover, even if translatability and agent's ingenuousness were not the problems they are, it is doubtful whether a description of agents' mental worlds could ever constitute an explanation of their actions. An arrantly anti-causal hermeneutics is apt to collapse into offering as an 'explanation' an agent's assertion 'because I wanted to'.16 Despite Dunn's scepticism about verstehen, one is left with a distinct sense that the claims of a version of hermeneutics prevail. What for Skinner was an 'exegetical duty' is elevated by Dunn to a moral imperative:'7 he insists that we owe it to past agents to listen to their own accounts of their purposes. It is 'imprudent and rude not to attend to what they say'. Ignoring their claims about what they are doing is good ground for 'strong moral resentment'. We are in breach of natural justice if we dispose of their own reasons as merely 'false consciousness' or ideological delusion, distracting our attention from the 'real ' determinants of action. (In other words, not listening is as inept and as insulting as 'explaining' an adolescent's protests as 'a phase they are going through'.) As with all Dunn's prescriptions, a qualifying clause intrudes: in asking that the historian or social scientist listen to agents, we must beware of parading 'mildly supererogatory and Christian-sounding virtues in the more or less optimistic hope of doing ourselves an epistemological favour'. None the less, the qualifier gives way, in his final sentence, to the superadding of moral upon hermeneutical prescription: ' to be a bad sociologist or historian . . may even be a category within naturalistic ethics'. To extrapolate Dunn's point somewhat, it would surely be no more eccentric an enterprise to elucidate why it is that as historians we might be said to 14 P. Laslett, W. G. Runciman and Q.

At any rate, the injunction of hermeneutical charity looks like being a sticking-point for the linguistic con- textualists which, pace their earliest critics, places them in a position firmly hostile to many current varieties of 'realist' explanation. To my mind, it is a good sticking-point. To illustrate these observations, the case of Locke is peculiarly serviceable. At present it seems hardly possible for Locke scholars to put pen to paper without self-conscious elaboration of methodological frameworks.'8 Perhaps Locke himself is responsible: not only did he describe a theory of language as constitutive of the social world, but also he has good claims to being the first writer to have a concept of 'ideology', that is, a perception of the relationship between mental events and social and psychological circumstances. The Los Angeles Clark Library has now printed two lectures on Locke by Ashcraft and Pocock, in which they continue an old contention.'9 Locke has claimed the attention not only of Pocock, but also of several devotees of the linguistic context. Dunn and Skinner have taken the injunction to respect agents' own beliefs to be a decisive refutation of C. B. Macpherson's attempt to portray Locke as providing a vindication of untrammelled accumulation of wealth within a burgeoning capitalist economy. Locke, they say, could not possibly have himself intended such a thing.20 Dunn transformed Locke studies with The political thought of John Locke (1 969). In his new collection he reprints two early papers, on Locke's theory of consent and on Locke's influence (or, rather, lack of it) in eighteenth-century England and America.2' After a number of years, Dunn has returned to the study of Locke. There are two new articles,22 not in this collection, and he is now completing a volume on Locke for the Oxford University Press's Past Masters series. The methodological presuppositions of Dunn, Pocock and Skinner also inform the recent work ofJames Tully, A discourse on property: John Locke and his adversaries (I980), and articles byJudith Richards, Lotte Mulligan and Keith Graham (the La Trobe Troika!). Tully's book is executed with considerable intellectual finesse, but its exegetical efforts are expanded principally in establishing Locke's relationship to an emergent tradition of rights theory and to the epistemological roots of the concept of property, rather than in an investigation of how Locke's conclusions served practically to defend the policies and strategies of the Whigs. His claims about Locke's axioms - that property is that which I name, impose my will upon, and that polity is a linguistic creation - are elaborately sustained. But his claims about Locke's support for Leveller-like reforms and his radical divergences from Whig moderation 18 Apart from items mentioned below, see also T.

Locke is admitted (perhaps anachronistically) into the hermeneutical world of the linguistic, and hence social, construction of reality. But the practical context of Restoration politics is absent. The shade of Wittgenstein hangs over Tully's Locke, and the innocent reader will be struck by how philosophical, not how historical, his book is.23 Locke does not appear as an ideologue, nor barely as a polemicist - certainly not where Ashcraft would put him, in Westminster Hall and Will's Coffee House. In a recent article, "' Property" and " people ": political usages of Locke and some contemporaries', Richards, Mulligan and Graham seek to establish Locke's meaning by comparison with other treatises, in order to establish the prevailing linguistic conventions.24 In a recent article in this journal,25 they similarly analyse Locke and his contemporaries' usages of 'substance', one of the key elements in his epistemology. The discussion in both articles is intellectually impressive and the enterprise an important one, but it rests wholly upon decoding manceuvres within a language game. More generally, their and Tully's cases rest on the axiom that only that which is articulated is historically admissible, only that which is uttered is an event: history is people doing things with words. Yet it seems odd that Locke's 'polemical purposes' can be identified wholly in terms of his reworking of meanings, decoded by conducting scholarly raiding parties into the treatises of contemporaries. It tends to neglect the question of why an agent sought to do something in politics, in preference for the question of how the doing of it was linguistically, and hence practically, achieved. We shall need some straightforward political and biographical history to know why Locke did what he did, and so to give us a more sanguineous Locke.26 When, in the I69os, Bishop Stillingfleet attacked Locke's Essay concerning human understanding, he headed straight for the metaphysics of' substance' and immediately associated Locke's doctrines with religious heresy.27 Any discussion of Locke's purposes in analysing the idea of 'substance' must acknowledge the problem of religious toleration in Restoration politics. Locke, like many contemporaries, assaulted the received concept of substance as part of a general criticism of the scholasticism still prevailing at Oxford and Cambridge and in conventional Anglican theology. His train of thought leads from the analysis of 'substance' to sceptical epistemology, thence to doubts about the dogmatism of the Puritan sects and the High Anglicans, and so to liberal theology and a starkly Erastian attack on priestcraft. Locke's sniping at the 'leaders of the church, moved by avarice and an insatiable desire of dominion'28 exactly matches the unceasing refrain of the radical Whigs, dissenters and freethinkers of Restoration England. The identification of Locke's religious convictions as theoretical underpinnings (the contribution of 23 Cf. J. Tully, 'Current thinking about sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political theory', Historical Journal, XXIV ( I 98 I ). 24 Journal of the History of Ideas, XLII (I980). 25 'A concern for understanding: a case of Locke's precepts and practice', Historical Journal, XXV (i 982). 26 Ironically, Mulligan et al. have criticized Skinner for too narrow a notion of context: 'Intentions and conventions'.

Gough (Oxford, I968), pp. I45-9.</page><page sequence="8">734 HISTORICAL JOURNAL Dunn's Political thought of John Locke) needs to be supplemented by a recognition of these commitments nearer to the surface of Locke's practical politics. It should be said that Tully himself has now set about situating Locke's theoretical radicalism in the practical extremities of Protestant Nonconformity, and this will appear in his edition of Locke's toleration tracts, in the Clarendon Press's edition of the Works. The question of ecclesiology and toleration is coming to be seen as an important context for Locke's politics. Tully, together with Ashcraft, Martyn Thompson, Gordon Schochet and myself, addressed themselves to it in papers in I980 at a conference marking the tercentenary of the Two treatises.29 The lexis of Tully's and La Trobe's Locke contrasts markedly with the praxis of Ashcraft's Locke. Ashcraft will shortly publish an intellectual biography of Locke. In his 1977 Clark Library lecture he holds that the mistake of Locke's previous biographers was to have 'perpetuated a myth of Locke's political innocence in order to preserve the detachment they associate with a great philosopher '.30 Instead, Ashcraft sends Locke to fight at the barricades of Exclusion Whiggism, arm in arm with persecuted dissenters and alienated aristocrats. Like Christopher Hill's Milton- in-the-alehouses, Locke now lurks in Whig coffee houses and conspiratorial country mansions. Ashcraft closely documents Locke's seditious involvements with his employer, Shaftesbury, and with the plotters of Rye House in I683 and the Monmouth rebellion in I685. The Two treatises, he argues, is not a document which belongs, as Laslett argued it did, to about i68o, when the Whigs were still operating within the pale of parliamentary politics, but to the insurrectionism of 1683. This is an attractive hypothesis (in the end unprovable), for if true it may help to explain Locke's remarkable lack of interest in analysing the constitutional history and status of Parliament, an enterprise engaged in by his fellow Whigs Petyt and Atwood, and a lacuna that has struck Skinner and Dunn. Locke, for Ashcraft, is a bourgeois liberal, not of the sedate rentier kind of Macpherson's depiction, but an insurgent revolutionary of a fledgling class. Ashcraft, adopting Mannheim's conception, argues that Locke articulated the collective enterprise' of the Whigs. Indeed, Ashcraft is on the verge of abolishing authorship and texts altogether, for the ' propensity to define political theory as the product of an individual philosopher represents... a serious misconception as to the nature of political theory'. Locke's thought is ' the theoretical expression of a political movement... rather than a set of propositions or ideas contained in a particular text'. 31 This is an unambiguous and emphatic position. Its outcome would be the abolition of philosophy and the history of ideas. And if this is contextual history, then the linguistic contextualists are indeed rampant textualists and unashamed neo- Kantians, and rightly so! At the Locke tercentennial conference, Dunn, Pocock and Ashcraft were present: the two former reprimanded the latter for reducing the Two treatises to a polemical pamphlet, for demeaning the text and attempting to identify 29 'John Locke and the political thought of the I 68os': Conference for the study of political thought, Folger Institute, Washington, D.C., March I980.

The radicalism lay rather in the argument of the text. This concern that the text as 'ideology' should not displace the text as ' theory' is voiced by Pocock in his Clark Library lecture, again aimed at Ashcraft. The trouble is, Pocock argues, that students of 'ideology' seek to uncover elements 'at variance with the work's ostensible theoretical intentions', that indeed the term 'ideology' can 'in fact only be used with implications of undisclosed or unformulated intention'. If this is so, then the cardinal hermeneutical injunction of respecting authors' articulated inten- tions is abrogated. Pocock pleads that overt intention is entitled to at least 'parity of esteem' with the covert, if the 'crudity and slipperiness' of reductionism is not to set in. 32 Pocock's defence of the autonomy of political theory supports one point I have been making, that the early charge of 'determinism' and 'reductionism' against the linguistic contextualists is surely inapposite: it is positively quaint. In turning now to utopianism, we do not leave Mannheim, or his followers and critics, behind, for its modern historical study is a legatee of Ideology and utopia. Mannheim defined utopianism broadly, apologizing for not confining himself to texts modelled on Thomas More's Utopia. The 'utopian mentality' is that state of mind which transcends present reality and breaks the bonds of the existing order. He spoke of utopianism as 'wish fulfilment', and of the 'psychic energies' unleashed in utopian creativity. But his predominant explanatory model was the historical stages of development, each producing corresponding stages in political mentality. Utopianism was essentially the product of the modern, bourgeois phase. The medievals envisioned paradise, but did not dream of a revolutionary activism or of a secular, mundane ideal. Mannheim detected four configurations of utopianism. First, the chiliastic uprising of the Lutheran extremists, notably that of Thomas Muntzer. This was a 'decisive turning point in modern history', for it represented the union of Christian apocalypticism with the active demands of the oppressed strata of society. Secondly, the liberal-humanitarian mode: the rationalist utopias of the Enlightenment. Mannheim did not explicitly include More as a precursor, but presumably saw him as such. This interpretation of Utopia had been elaborated by Kautsky, and more recently by Ames, who argued that 'the core of the book is republican, bourgeois and democratic ', and embodied the'dangerously progressive projects of a... middle- class English citizen . Mannheim nicely drew the contrasts between the first two modes: between the creative destroyers and the sardonic critics; between the ecstatic spirituality of an incipient lumpenproletariat and the enlightened intellectualism of bourgeois anticlericals; between the eschatological attempt to escape time by apocalypse now, and the secular liberal attempt to escape place with a world or an island reconstructed. The third utopian mode, paradoxically, is a conservative counter-utopia, represented by Hegel and the Romantics, which finds its rational and natural ideals embodied in the here and now. The fourth mode is the socialist and communist utopias, which began with St Simon, Fourier and Owen, as a socialist version of liberal-humanitarianism, and in Bakunin, as an anarchist chiliasm, but became, in Marx, an historically determinist utopianism. A recent stimulus to the study of utopianism was the Romantic revolt of the I 96os 32 Pocock, 'The myth of John Locke and the obsession with liberalism', in Pocock and Ashcraft, joohn Locke, pp. 9-IO. 33 K.

That phase seems not to have produced a significant work of political imagination, a new utopia, but after the necessary academic delay the traces of those years are surfacing in historical literature. Utopianism, in Mannheim's sense of an activist and imaginative break with political realities, is being unearthed in the historical past, in perhaps wistful regret that it did not find fruition in i968. Christopher Hill led the way: his World turned upside down (I 972) and Milton and the English Revolution (I977) investigated the popular liberation of social imagination in the mid-seventeenth century. Explorers of Charles Taylor's Hegel (I975) and Hegel and the modern state (I979) discover an attempt to resolve, through Hegel, the modern tension, most piquantly felt in the ig60s, between the claims of absolute freedom, which arose originally out of the protests of the 'Romantic expressivists', and the necessity we are under of being situated in the actual world of nature and history. Richard Ashcraft, as we have seen, has given us a Locke at the barricades. Frank and Fritzie Manuel and J. C. Davis have been investigating utopias since the ig60s; the Manuels published two books on the subject in I966.34 They express regret at our present paucity of idealist vision. The epilogue to the Manuels' monumental Utopian thought in the western world concludes that in the twentieth century, generations of unmasking dystopians have caused an 'impoverishment of the utopian imagination'. Without it we are bereft of recognition of new potentiality, and unfulfilled in our collective psychic need for a fantasy of social perfection. Davis, too, concludes his Utopia and the ideal society with the thought that our social ills will not be resolved without an 'ultimately ideal reference point'.35 Davis has recovered a considerable corpus of otherwise neglected English visionary treatises of the early modern period, and has provided engaging exegeses set within a striking interpretative framework. The Manuels' brief is much more ambitious. Their goo-page book spans utopianism and dystopianism from the Renaissance to the present, prefaced by sketches of ancient inspirations: the Judaeo-Christian paradise and the classical Golden Age. Davis covers More, Robert Burton, Francis Bacon, Samuel Gott, Gerard Winstanley, James Harrington and several seventeenth-century royalist, radical, and 'full employment' utopias. Some of the same ground is covered by the Manuels, who take us through the Christian utopias from More, to Campanella (whose name, incidentally, is inscribed in Red Square as a socialist founding father), to Leibniz; on to the Enlightenment ideals of progress and the noble savage, to the socialist communities of the early nineteenth century, and thence to Marx and Comte. Both books exhibit an impressive command of the extensive literature on utopianism, and the Manuels' book especially brims with erudition. Mannheim casts a long shadow. Davis numbers among his intellectual debts Werner Stark, the American inheritor of the tradition of the 'sociology of knowledge'. In his Introduction, Davis comments upon the impact in recent years of Pocock's methodology, which he describes as committed to 'the autonomy of thought (at least of language) ', and to the investigation of intellectual history in terms of' self-conscious traditions' of thought. But in a tone reminiscent of Mannheim's methodological 34 Utopias and utopian thought (ed.) (Boston, I966); French utopias: ani anthology of ideal societies (New York, I966). 35 Manuel and Manuel, Utopian thought in the western world (Oxford, I979), p. 8oi; Davis, Utopia and the ideal society: a study of English utopian writing i5i6-1700 (Cambridge, I98I), p. 388.</page><page sequence="11">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 737 strictures, he goes on to assert that these methods are 'entirely inappropriate' to the study of utopian thought. Early modern utopias were neither a 'commentary on', nor 'modifications' of, a tradition. He remarks that it may be, for instance, that Harrington, in writing Oceana (i656), had not read More's Utopia.36 None the less, these two books have 'much in common', because they share 'structures of thought'. Bacon, Andrea, Harrington and More are not part of a 'developing intellectual tradition', but share a 'subjection to a common mode of social idealisation'. It is Davis's intention to establish the common structure of that mode. However, since he makes little attempt to predicate these 'structures' upon any determinate social class, or to show the relationship between any particular utopia and its historical circumstances, the deployment of this concept of structure does little real work. Davis in fact recurs to the type of analysis he claims to eschew: we are told that More's Utopia 'must be the defining source for the modern utopian tradition'.37 The Manuels, by speaking broadly of the 'utopian propensity' reject narrow definitions and their book covers immense ground. After sketching the twin ancient roots which provide the 'underthought' of modern utopianism, they isolate three loci for the birth of utopia: More; the millenarian communists of Munster; and the citta&amp;felice of the Vitruvius-inspired Renaissance architects of northern Italy. They argue that the 'historical longevity of certain mythic themes in utopia' suggests deep-rooted psychic needs in 'Western consciousness'. The Manuels recur to the Freudian and the Jungian with great regularity. 'Psychic life' and 'collective consciousness' stalk through their pages. Utopian writing, they hold, is a 'regressive phenomenon', a childlike fantasy escapism, a 'mother yearning', a 'narcissism'. This idiom reaches its apogee in reference to the utopian writings of the English Civil War: a 'massive discharge of utopian fantasy .38 As with Davis, no very energetic attempt at historical contextualization occurs. A marchpast of biographies and plot summaries ensues, although liberally spiced with allusions, parallels and cross-references. The European stage of the Manuels' book makes it preferable to Davis's, though Davis does have a chapter on the German Lutheran utopias of the early seventeenth century, since the pansophist idealists of the I640s in England need to be placed in relation to Andrea and Comenius. However, the much more rigorous typology adopted by Davis makes his book more disciplined than the Manuels' somewhat promiscuously inclusive coverage of fantasy and optimism in Western culture. Davis is keen to make some important distinctions, and lists four types of ideal societies, aside from utopia proper. In Cockayne, nature's superabundance satiates every human desire. In Arcadia, nature is also fruitful, but people moderate in their demands; conflicts within society and with nature are at an end, toil alleviated. Where Cockayne is orgiastic and epicurean, and delights in visions of dragging the ruling orders through the mire, the Arcadians are the stoic noble savages of Hesiod's Works and days, Montaigne's Of cannibals, or Henry Neville's Isle of pines (I 668). The third type is the perfect moral commonwealth. Here the social and natural structure remains as at present, but the inhabitants are morally transformed. This is the world of Thomas Lupton's Sivqila (I 580), where there are 'godly lawes. . . zealous husbands, 36 Davis, Utopia, pp. 2-3.

Manuel, 'Toward a psychological history of utopia', in Manuel, ed., Utopias. 24 HIS 26</page><page sequence="12">738 HISTORICAL JOURNAL obedient wives. .. trustie servants, good landlords, honest tenants' and so on. Fourthly, there is millenarianism, such as that of the Fifth Monarchists: the moral and spiritual transformation of human nature as a result, or in anticipation, of Christ's Second Coming. Davis argues that utopia, properly so-called - and this is a claim of considerable credibility - is 'more realistic and tough-minded' than other ideal societies, since it accepts as given both the limited satisfactions possible for people exposed to conditions of economic scarcity, and people's actual propensities as peccant beings. Utopia is about the construction of institutions and practices for controlling the results of these necessary preconditions. The fundamental characteristic of utopianism is therefore its acceptance of man's corruption, the inevitability of sin, of passionate waywardness. Utopias are not idylls peopled by the morally regenerate; they are not fantasies, nor merely morally edifying admonitions, but deadly serious attempts at taking men as they are and laws as they might be.39 Since human nature is incorrigible, the keynote of utopias is artifice. They all display a concern to establish a totality of structured, ordered institutions, elaborate infrastructures ofbureaucracy, education, welfare and, above all, morally disciplining authority. Together with this obsession with the details of planned existence, there is a pre-Benthamic emphasis upon the mechanics of making legislation effective through efficientjudicial administration. Davis's exegeses are designed to substantiate the claims that utopianiasm, as a mode of political writing, had an unavoidable structure, and that its practitioners were compelled to elaborate a set of remarkably similar features. The recurrence of similar institutional characteristics in utopias over two centuries is indeed striking. The panoply of vicious punishments for moral misdeeds, bureaucratic intrusiveness, mathematically precise hierarchies, eugenic controls, sumptuary regulations, educational projects, youth opportunity pro- grammes, and geometric city planning, recur over and over. (Davis records some delightful eccentricities, such as Andrea's street-lighting (I6I9) for better moral surveillance, and Burton's premonition of welfarist rights theory in his advocacy (I62 I) of large dowries for ugly women and none for the pretty.) Thus far, Davis's thesis is compelling. But it is another, bolder claim he makes, which seems to me historically implausible. Utopias, he maintains, far from being tame fantasies, are the fountainhead of a pervasive modern phenomenon: the totalitarian state. It is a stimulating claim, because it rescues utopianism from an historical cul-de-sac, and subverts our assumption that utopias are fantastic idylls. The claim acquires some plausibility from his carefully documented characterization of utopias as resting upon a realistic account of human nature, coupled with an astonishingly intensive apparatus of moral surveillance. We are certainly reminded of Benthamic or (B. F.) Skinnerian nightmares of behavioural control.40 More's Utopia, Davis contends, is'totalitarian in its scope and devoid of human individuality'. More thus is led to 'jeopardise [individuals'] whole status as moral agents'. Gott's Nova Solyma (i648) seeks to 'condition men's behaviour' by 'repressive moral conformity'. Winstanley's Laws offreedom (i 652) provides an ' apparatus oftotalitarian discipline' and a 'system for the indoctrination of children in citizenship '.41 Utopia, Davis urges, is dangerously seductive because it seeks a comforting escape from the 39 Cf. M. Eliav-Feldon, Realistic uitopias: the ideal imaginary societies of the Renaissanzce 1516-1630 (Oxford, I982). 40 B. F.

Its moral certainties are attractive, but the cost is loss of freedom. In the end Davis prefers the 'muddle' and 'fragmentation' of Western liberalism, the 'least bad of all possible worlds .42 This plea for liberal pluralism over totalitarian utopianism will not do as an historically plausible conclusion, for an historical disjunction of central importance separates the 'totalizing' tendency of the modern state from pre-modern utopias. In between lie the Enlightenment and the nineteenth century, during which time two concepts appeared which were unavailable to the pre-moderns. One is a completed doctrine of positivist sovereignty, by which laws have their validity solely by virtue of their being injunctions of an empowered state legislator. Such laws are uncontestable and cannot be traduced by any rival juridical standard. Despite first appearances, the demanding commonwealths of the old utopias make no such claim. The second modern concept is behaviourism, the plasticity of a human nature which can be reconstructed by conditioning.43 This takes its roots in Enlightenment social theory, in English associational psychology, in Rousseau's socially unconstructed amour de soi passing over into amour-propre, and in the Scottish moralists' natural history of the passions. The Enlightenment thinkers engaged in moral science, but created the possibility of demoralized politics. Precisely because the human nature of the old utopias was incorrigible, it required guidance and coercion. The language of' conditioning' and 'indoctrination' is wholly inapplicable to those utopias. There the godly magistrate instructs a person in his duties and inflicts punishments upon his sins. He addresses a morally culpable agent. This is not the 'reconditioning' of an automaton, but the moral education of a citizen. True, the early modern utopians lacked our modern individualism: people had duties of active responsibility for each others' values; but it is responsibility that they had, not merely coercive suasion. Davis has a laudable distaste for behaviourism; but he has caught and condemned some innocent bystanders. Between More's moral philosophy and Condorcet's or Comte's sociology of human plasticity lies a fundamental gulf.44 In Davis's and the Manuels' methodological predilections, two things are lacking: an historical sense of why certain texts are written at particular junctures, and a philosophical sense that texts present arguments. Davis cites as the best representative of a history of political thought conceived as an investigation of linguistic paradigms Pocock's Machiavellian moment, but then he cavalierly denies the possibility that a history of utopianism might be written in similar vein. The Manuels, meanwhile, say of More that 'only' through psychology can the historian 'presume to make sense' of him.45 The history of utopianism seems, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be peculiarly prone to pathological treatment, rather than to intellectual history. The history of political thought is the history of self-conscious argument offered for a polemical purpose, of traditions creatively reconstructed to meet an exigent need. Pocock's Machiavellian moment is a model. It traced the influence of Aristotelian concepts, revived by Machiavelli and Guicciardini, through English and American constitutional and republican thought to the late eighteenth century. It is an account of the re-introduction of the possibility of secular fulfilment, the classical polis 42 Ibid. pp. 375, 388. 43 Cf. M. Hollis, Models of man (Cambridge, I977). 44 Cf. B.

It is the history of how changing circumstances generated new reflexions upon the citizen values and political institutions recommended by Aristotle, Cicero, Livy and Polybius. Similarly, a history of utopianism in early modern Europe could be written. It would be a parallel account of Platonic concepts. It would be the history of a pan-European, rather than an Atlantic tradition. In its classicism, it too disrupted the Christian time-scale. Utopias tend to be static and timeless, neither the millennial history of Christian eschatology, nor the cyclical rise and fall of commonwealths of the Aristotelian model. In its duration, it too was an early modern phenomenon, which became possible with the printing by Ficino of the Platonic corpus in 1484 and of Plutarch's Lives in 1470, which included the semi-apocryphal accounts of the Athenian and Spartan legislators, Solon and Lycurgus, the mythic archetypes of wise governance. This tradition of utopianism lapsed when Christian theology ceased to inform the Platonic inheritance. The similarities between utopias reflect, simply, an extraordinary intellectual dependence on Plato's Republic. The guiding principle of the utopias was that human commonwealths should be manifestations of rationally demonstrable truths and values. Since truth is a unity, of course utopias are not plural societies. At every step, Plato guided. First, the yearning for a philosopher-king, and the conviction that it was the duty of intellectuals to advise princes - what the Manuels felicitously call 'the Ear of Dionysius', in reference to Plato's attempted education of the tyrant of Syracuse. Some inkling of More's King Utopos, Campanella's Metafisico (1602), or Veiras's Sevarias (I675), of a Solon or Lycurgus, was sought in the unpromising material of European princes. Comenius in I637 dubbed the infant Louis XIV a future Sun-King, and Plato's midwife46 ran riot in Leibniz's search, successively in Louis, the Emperor, and Czar Peter the Great ('the Solon of Russia'), for sapientia incarnate, who would assist at the birth of universal empire, universal science, and universal religion. Secondly, we find a rationalist concept of law, and not, pace Davis, a voluntarist. The laws are self-evident norms to which any rational person would accede: they are the Solonic arpos, that which is fitting. The ruler is not the creative source of law, but its representative and symbol. In so far as the magistrate's task is coercive, it is to force men to be free, to prevent men becoming slaves to their passions. (Rabelais's Abbey of Theleme in Gargantua satirizes this: 'do what you will' is the rule-less code of life - and life turns our to be spontaneously regulated, ordered and restrained.) Thirdly, there is a preoccupation with education, particularly with training of a utilitarian and technical kind. Education is for all, including women, though generally an elite rigorously pursues the higher and universal knowledge, pansophia. Two characteristic Platonic ideas prevail: that of illumination, spiritual purification and not merely laborious learning as the key to insight (theosophy); and that of recollection, the educator bringing out knowledge that lies dormant within everyone. Plato's Guardians and his parable of the Cave stalk the pages of the utopias. Fourthly, we find the advocacy of rational religion, and a humanist eschewal of ecstatic, biblicist, and sectarian Christianity. The Erasmian and Protestant search for the simplicity of the Primitive Church, and the Christian Neo-platonist emphasis on the Johannine Logos,47 blend with the Platonic notion that beneath all religions 46 Cf I. M. Crombie, Plato: the midwife's apprentice (I964). 47 Gospel of St John, i, 'In the beginning was the Word . . .'</page><page sequence="15">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 741 there is a kernel of universal truth. The great religious teachers had intuited a fundament of spiritual truths, which tolerant and charitable investigation could uncover from beneath the cultural and historical accretions of particular sects. For some (like Campanella) Christ became Supreme Reason; for others, Christianity gave way to pantheism (as in Giordano Bruno), or worship of the Sun as the divine light (as in Veiras). For nearly all the utopians, the essential corollary was religious toleration and extreme erastianism: the 'state religion' which modern hunters of totalitarianism are apt so unhistorically to descend upon. 'State religion' was never a cynical device for encouraging political obeisance, but the outcome of a genuinely spiritual and deeply tolerant Christian Platonism, which abhorred irrational priestcraft and warring sectarianism. The catalogue of Platonic inspirations could continue: communalism; limitations upon private property; and sometimes upon the family and sex role differentiation; the Pythagorean passion for mystic numbers and sacred geometry in architecture, town planning and social hierarchies. The materials for an intellectual history of early modern Platonic utopianism are amply present in Davis's and the Manuels' books. Their documentation and exegeses are exceptionally thorough, but the recognition of the utopians' 'book-ridden' Platonism (as the Manuels rightly concede it to be)48 is sufficiently overlaid, in the one case by the pursuit of psychohistory, and in the other by the uncovering of incipient totalitarianism, to blur the potentially clean lines of the inquiry. Reliance upon Plato is the most striking and the connecting feature of the early modern utopias. This fact has recently been demonstrated for More by Brendan Bradshaw.49 A history after the model of Pocock's Machiavellian moment would have to go on to provide historically specific contexts for individual texts. Here I want to focus upon one utopia of the late seventeenth century. A virtue of Davis's and the Manuels' books is their recovery of neglected texts. Davis has rescued Antiquity reviv'd, an anonymous treatise of 1693; I know of no other discussion of it. It is a deeply Platonist book: absolutist, rationalist, and 'enlightened'. It also provides an unexpected connexion between Locke and utopianism. Davis's assiduous rescue of Royalist utopias is to be welcomed, but two aspects of Antiquity reviv'd have evaded him. The first is that although, on the face of it, it portrays a sentimental vision of a Stuart monarchical paradise, it also leans heavily on Locke's metaphysics. The book is indeed stunning in its extraordinary combination of rationalist deism in religion and Jacobite patriarchalism in politics, dependent, to the point of plagiary, equally upon Locke's Essay concerning human understanding as upon Filmer's Patriarcha and The anarchy of a mixed monarchy. Davis was, secondly, unable to supply authorship. It can, however, be attributed to Francis Lee, a Nonjuror ejected from his Fellowship at St John's College, Oxford, in I690. There is no explicit ascription available, but the necessary information occurs in an unnoticed Cambridge manuscript biography of Lee.50 Lee was an eccentric figure who managed to suppress himself from history by an almost pathological self-effacement. A score of his anonymous works are scattered around the turn of the eighteenth century. He was a correspondent of Prime Minister Robert Harley and Czar Peter the Great, a self-appointed humanist educator of princes, after the fashion, says his biographer, of Bacon or Colbert. A physician and 48 Manuel and Manuel, Utopian thought, p. i io. 49 B.

Lee endorsed, more or less simultaneously, Comenian pansophism, Cabbalist science, Malebranche's Cartesianism, Henry More's Christian Neopla- tonism, Jacob Boehme's mysticism, Fenelon's devotion to female education, Richard Simon's biblical criticism, and Locke's epistemology. If I am right about Locke's influence on Antiquity reviv'd, then the work turns out to be the first book to exploit Human understanding (published in 1689) as a ground for rational religion - earlier, that is, than John Toland's Christianity not mysterious (I695) and Locke's own Reasonableness of Christianity (I696). Lee's book exhibits the remarkable continuity of the humanist and Neoplatonist utopian commitment, but is now informed by the new epistemology: it stands between Renaissance and Enlightenment. Fidefendon, the religious official on the island of Astreada, tells his shipwrecked Greek visitors, who have fled Alexander the Great's usurpation of Athens (a parallel for William of Orange's usurpation of England), that the Astreadan religion consists of simple 'deducible' propositions. Taking as a maxim of 'human understanding' that 'nothing is in the intellect of man, but was first in the senses', he shows that human senses cannot apprehend a spiritual being, they can only detect the manifest effects of a causal and beneficent Providence. So the Astreadans worship a Supreme Being, but do not presume any knowledge of its 'essential nature or modality of existence', for to give God attributes would inevitably be anthropomorphic. Fidefendon even makes that most famous and shocking of Locke's points, which was to reverberate through the materialist literature of the Enlightenment, that to assert that there is a Supreme Cause does not demonstrate that the Cause is a spirit - though Locke and Lee conclude that the probability is that God and the soul are spirit.5' Fidefendon remarks that the things of God are beyond 'the limited qualification of human understanding'. Locke provided epistemological grounds for the Lutheran inscrutable and absconded God. The novel theological problem posed by the new epistemology, and especially by Descartes, was how matter and spirit could be bridged. Fidefendon's urgent query is: 'how can a spiritual essence actuate on things of a corporeal nature, that are limited and qualified accordingly?'. Scepticism pervades the religion of Astreada. The particular creeds of sects are 'absurd', if based only on pretences of revelations or miracles, for there is no certainty in what is only hearsay from would-be prophets. This prefigures a central theme of Locke's Reasonableness. The Astreadans dispose of predestination. About the soul they are unsure: immortality is a mistake; the resurrection of the body in a future elysium is implausible; but a world-soul or a transmigration of souls is not thought implausible. This doubt reflects Lee's own difficulties and a number of the non-Lockean features are strikingly Platonist: the Supreme Being 'animates all things'; and is the 'soul of the world ... of which every individual participates'. Astreadan religion is contrasted with the obfuscations of priestcraft. This was a common late-seventeenth-century radical theme, but it is here wrought through Book iv of Human understanding. The 'superstructures' of religion were 'frauds and devices', designed by priests 'for secular esteem, advantage and interest'. The divines 'allured, deceived, and opposed men's understandings' and 'taught [them] 51 Locke, Essay concerning human understanding, bk. iv, ch. io.</page><page sequence="17">HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 743 to pin their faith on the relations of such as had greatest reputation of piety and learning, though in truth [were] the mistakers and abusers of truth 5.2 Lee, a devoted friend of Nonjuror clergy, was to have an unpleasant several years, as he pursued the most shockingly heretical divinity of the age, until he eventually returned to the High Anglican fold. That such a theology as the Astreadans' could belong to a 'Jacobite' utopia may seem implausible. But Jussinedo, a magistrate, now comes on the scene, to talk of their 'perfectly monarchical' polity, without 'partition or mixture', inherited from the 'paternal and primitive despotical lord', the original natural father. He 'explodes all pretence' of the 'perverse conceit' of 'original contract', and explains that the 'popular origin of power or natural freedom of mankind' is absurd and impossible. This, of course, is pure Filmer, informed perhaps by the Platonic philosopher-king. Needless to say, the Astreadans live a life of 'sedate felicity' and 'rational accord'. The modern commentator who dismisses Lee as having a dishevelled intellect would be uncharitable. But it is not easy to place Lee into our familiar frameworks of seventeenth-century ideas. Let us, lastly, return to where we began. In 1956 Laslett announced that it was time to rescue political theory from those brands of sociology and philosophy then prevailing. He was also doing masterful work on Locke. Locke has become the very archetype of a theorist of political obligation. The heritage of nineteenth-century sociology enhances this, since those who reject the relativist and reductionist stance of the sociology of knowledge, or utilitarian ethics, tend to find themselves scuttling back to Locke. By insisting that political theory was 'part of moral philosophie', Locke stands as a bastion against sociology, in the sense that the eighteenth-century discovery of the plasticity of man's nature is deemed to have rendered the idea of ' obligation 'jejune. The title of Dunn's paper to the I 980 Locke conference is ' From applied theology to social analysis: the break between John Locke and the Scottish Enlightenment'. He asserted that Locke's 'purpose in setting himself to vindicate epistemologically the theocentric framework of his thought was precisely to shore up practical reason against the contingencies of sociology .53 He stresses the breach in the history of ideas that occurred in the eighteenth century. This is why the nineteenth-century utopias were so different from the earlier Platonist utopias. And it is also why another recent book on Locke, K. I. Vaughn's John Locke: economist and social scientist54 is misconceived, for it cannot plausibly be said that Locke saw his task to be that of a 'value-free scientist' seeking a 'unified science of man', in the modern positivist mode. It is not therefore surprising that an active historical interest in Locke is closely linked to a concern to construct a moral theory of political obligation. This is true of Nozick and Rawls. And of Laslett and Dunn. Dunn's Locke is a prolegomenon to Dunn's own political philosophy. This is manifest in another remark, which occurs in a recent essay, 'Individuality and Clientage in the Formation of Locke's Social Imagination', which investigates how Locke's social circumstances shaped his ideas. 'Sociology of knowledge' in some sense this essay is, but Dunn reminds us that ' to study human thinking as ideology is to study some of the constraints on our capacity to create rational order, not to seek to deny this capacity to whatever degree men 52 Lee, Antiquity reviv'd, pp. 6-24. 53 'From applied theology to social analysis', in M.

In his volume, Political obligation in its historical context, he gathers ten essays, written over twelve years. Superficially viewed, it is a heterogeneous collection, ranging from Locke to modern Ghana, from the methodology of the social sciences to modern revolutions. It is not only representative of Dunn's diversity of output, but is united by the focal conviction! that whilst it can mean something to construct a moral and political theory, any answer must be historically realistic. In other words, he is caught between the insights of sociology, which delights in unmasking the naivety of claims about perennial moral axioms, and the Kantian idea that it is mistaken to say that persons do not and cannot make meaningful moral judgements. The last essay in the book is a new and lengthy one: 'Political obligation and political possibilities'. Dunn surveys the present growth of theoretical speculation about political obligation. He has particularly in mind the liberal rights theorists Rawls, Nozick, Dworkin and Pateman.56 In the face of these, he reacts paradoxically: he is an earnest advocate of the revival of political and moral philosophy, but he issues stern admonitions lest our new moral formalism becomes facilely ignorant of the facts of social power and the limits of individual rational action. This warning is one purpose of this new essay, and it moves cautiously forward from his syllabus errorum, Western political thought in the face of the future.57 It is to be hoped that in due course Dunn will write a work of political philosophy. We can expect it to be of considerable stature. Meanwhile, he anxiously endeavours to identify the ' conceptual space' where such an enterprise would lie, and continues to be thoroughly iconoclastic in his dealings with the available alternatives. He is painfully aware of the difficulties of doing political theory, of the 'dimensions of conceptual restraint and analytical jeopardy' which it entails. Dunn repeatedly insists that the available, and especially liberal, theories of obligation are facile, because they cannot refer to people who find themselves, as all of us do, placed in particular historical circumstances. As a way out of this problem, he stresses the importance of sorting out a theory of rational action, since theories of political duty have tended to be endearing rather than pragmatically compelling. They have sacrificed analytical power in favour of piety, and so even theories with claims to analytical rigour and without utopian pretensions are described as being effectively utopian because ontologically feeble. The humans they posit are not historical persons, because their identities are abstracted from the cultures and problems they contingently find themselves in. Indeed, their procedure consists precisely in stripping individuals of their historical specificity in order to find a rational moral agent who has universal, but not particular interests: noble but contentless. In this sense, Rawls is no less loftily utopian than Plato or More. But like all good utopians, they have a salutary effect: they help jolt us into reflexion on our values, and to 'amend the moral damage' done to us by history. Dunn's discussion is modelled around two theories of rational action, which he calls 'internal reasons' and 'external reasons' theories, or, simply, subjective and objective theories. The latter are the kind we have just noted, theories which are 'edifying' in instructing us as to the kinds of goals it would be rational to adopt. But apart from their failure to be realistic, or to supply a theory about why anyone 55 In R. Brandt, ed., John Locke: symposium (Berlin, 198I), p. 15. 56 J.

The other kind of theory, the 'internal reasons', is deliberately agnostic about goals, exhibiting an extensive generosity to agents' 'subjective motivational set'. It is generous both in the methodological sense that rational action is said to make no sense unless the agent, by consulting his own bundle of values, would recognize the prudence of the proposed action; and in the ethical sense that the theory does not presume intrusively to reprimand (or even fully to understand) the values that a person holds. The theory has the advantages of operating in actual historical worlds and, because it 'generously' focuses upon what actually motivates people - what they in fact want - it could be said to be libertarian and hence morally preferable. These are, for instance, the salient analytical and moral justifications of the exponents of neo-classical economic theory. But the objection to this type of theory is that it is parochial in its historical horizon, 'imaginatively imprisoned', context- bound, and culpable in its disregard of the need to judge the validity of the goals people hold. It awards 'moral and cognitive authority to the obtuseness of actual historical agents'. Its ethic offers never more than hypothetical imperatives, and its sociological focus is individualist prudence. It is guilty of' myopia' and the 'crassest egoism'. Dunn shares with Rawls a disgust with utilitarianism and with the ideological props of capitalism, which 'install self-regarding prudence as the acme of practical reason', 'in lieu of a theory of political duty '.58 What is needed, Dunn goes on, is the advantages of each theory, without their disadvantages; a doctrine that is analytically powerful as well as morally valid, which connects an account of rationality in historically specific people with duties in relation to desirable social goals. The 'subjective reasons' theorist will respond that such an ambition will merely represent the arbitrary and illiberal imposition of a theorist's moral tastes. The 'objective reasons' theorist will say that what is being advocated is casuistry, since any theory of ethics, however grand its categorical imperatives, will recognize the element of moral ambiguity in actual human situations. To use Dunn's example: my duties, if I turned out to be a slave owner, are unlikely to be resolved simply by the injunction to cease being a slave owner. A response Dunn might make to these criticisms, though he does not explicitly do so, is a historical one: that the agnostic pluralism of utilitarian relativism, and the formalist vacuity of categorical imperatives, are recent perversions, barely entertained before Bentham and Kant. What Dunn seeks to do, though again he does not say so, is to reconstruct something like Aristotelian ethics. (In doing so, he stands close to the recent work of Alasdair MacIntyre.)59 The gist of Dunn's argument is roughly this. We are individuals with potentialities, realizable over a lifetime; we are not merely momentary beings, with bundles of contingent desires, who make single-act calculations. We need a theory of personal identity which construes agency in a sufficiently large sense, of a person over a lifetime. Our duties will not merely be of the bland type, 'do this', 'don't do that', but rather will comprise fulfilment of our potentialities. We have a demanding task of self-education: we must seek to understand the 'causal landscape' within which we act, and to sort out beneficial values and goals. We are not, that is, merely possessors of values, but 58 'Political obligation and political possibilities', in Political obligation: my quotations are from pp. 244, 246, 248, 255, 265, 272, 274, 28I. 59 A.

We must not merely consult our present desires and beliefs (utilitarian myopia) or naively cultivate good intentions ('Christian self-absorption'). We have, therefore, 'cognitive duties' and must attend to the 'ethics of belief'. Morality, in sum, is a matter of practical reason, Aristotle's phronesis. Persons are conceived of as acting in practical accordance with their values and goals. Yet nobody just 'happens to have' a set of values: we are responsible for the lines of thought and inquiry which lead us to our values. Not to engage in these inquiries is morally culpable: a fundamental sin of omission. John Dunn may not yet know what the content of our duties is, but we do at least know that the Dunnian moral agent is kept exceptionally busy. The primordial duty is sheer moral seriousness.</page></plain_text>
