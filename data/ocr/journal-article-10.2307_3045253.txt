New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1986. Pp. 351. $30. Raymond Williams' foreword and Ludmilla Jor- danova's introduction claim a pathfinding role for this collection of essays relating science and literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is, in fact, a specific defense of one variety of "new historicism" with some of the principal authorities referred to in the introduction and the early chapters being familiar ones in the history of ideas: Arthur Lovejoy, Raymond Williams, and lan Watt. Jordanova's introduction is really a theory of text production that is founded on the desire to explore the relations of the two domains in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century cul- ture. Leaning rather heavily on Williams' work-especially Keywords (1976; revised 1983)-she gives his historical and linguistic emphases a distinctly post-structuralist twist. She speaks, for instance, of emphasizing</page><page sequence="2">496 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE conflicts "about the nature of fundamental boundaries, like that between mind and body, human and animal, living and non-living, and male and female" (p. 33). Perhaps most important is the book's focus on the lan- guage of scientific debate and the "productive ambiguity" that results when various sciences and literary works share significant common terms. The book's primary interest is in the biological, social, and psychological sciences, and the ways in which literature is one of the crucibles "within which concepts of nature and of society are formed" (p. 54). Jordanova promises "detailed textual analyses," emphasizing the content, the rhet- oric, and the silences that are productive of knowledge about the texts, their writers, and their particular milieus. The editor introduces and links each of the essays in a way that can seem unduly leading at times, but that is also always informative. A. E. Pilkington's essay on "Nature as Ethical Norm in the Enlighten- ment" effectively demonstrates the difference between benevolent and "impersonal" or "ethically neutral" notions of nature in the eighteenth century. Contrasting the work of Prevost and Diderot to that of Laclos and de Sade, he makes a convincing but scarcely "pathfinding" contri- bution to understanding the different and contradictory ways in which ''nature" was conceived and treated. Though it does not really fulfill the claim of its wide-ranging title, Jordanova's essay on "Naturalizing the Family: Literature and the Bio- Medical Sciences in the Late Eighteenth Century" is valuable for the con- cepts it explores and the issues it raises about the ways in which family, women, and children were related, via certain biomedical and literary texts, to the prevailing notions of nature discussed by Pilkington. But like some other essays in the collection, the structure, argument, and conclu- sions are occasionally disappointing. Her position, basically, is that there were two views of women, children, and family: one, organicist, the other materialist and even mercantilist. Each had its exponents and its peculiar use of common linguistic pairs like female-male, nature-culture, private- public, family-society, and inside-outside (p. 91). In typical post-structur- alist fashion, Jordanova tends to give the materialist views priority as the really "operative" ones in the period. This obvious bias does not, however, affect the really useful insights in the essay. On occasion, as at the end of the essay, the conclusions drawn are not sufficiently demonstrated by the facts. Assertion outweighs argument, and objections or alternative positions are not examined. The effect is to suggest an almost dogmatic rhetoric beneath the otherwise evident sensitivity to fluidity of terms and changes in concept. Essays on Sterne and the relation of mind and matter, the didactic poems of Erasmus Darwin, the anthropomorphic images in Darwin's Or-</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 497 igin of Species, physiological psychology in Silas Marner, and the conser- vative tendency of Jules Michelet's natural history writing complete the volume. Articulate, informative, and graced by enough brilliant insights to repay careful reading of its densely argued texture, the book is de- cidedly a contribution to its field. But it is only the most recent in a line of fine interdisciplinary works like James Paradis and Thomas Postlewait's Victorian Science and Victorian Values: Literary Perspectives (1981), Judith Wechsler's On Aesthetics in Science (1978), and some of the volumes in the Boston series in the History of Science. Somewhat disturbing in this example of the new genre of interdis- ciplinary studies of science and literature, however, is the tendency to excessive "scientific" terseness. This includes the "convention" of citing, on numerous occasions, whole works instead of particular pages. Where we might otherwise expect "detailed textual analyses," we get instead, in parentheses, a summary reference to an entire work or several works. In discussing Darwin's analogies of kinship, for instance, Gillian Beer says, "analogy and metaphor [in Origin of Species] express kinship, disturb hier- archy, make us look again at the orderings of our value systems (Hesse, 1966; Black, 1962)" (p. 238). Mary Hesse's Models and Analogies in Science, which does not treat of Darwin at all, is most certainly not just about those claims that Beer makes. Such citation is obviously meant to put the whole weight of the particular text behind the writer's conclusion. In certain professional journals devoted to the experimental sciences this convention is understandable and necessary in the interest of efficiency and space. In this text such citations sometimes hide real agendas and help the work to assume the mantle of scientific objectivity that the history of science has only recently earned. In her essay on Silas Marner, Sally Shuttleworth finds Eliot "ques- tioning continuous psychological development" as it was conceived by mid-nineteenth-century thinkers. This is an exciting idea and brings knowledge of Victorian psychology to bear on a fascinating literary text, full of the anomalous occurrences that make critics consider it a novelistic "fairy tale." But Shuttleworth's knowledge of Eliot's essays on contem- porary psychology seems derived from secondary sources, her discussion of the matter, force, and energy debate is referenced by a single 1970 Cambridge dissertation (ignoring recent scholarly publications on the topic), and her references to notions of the unconscious in nineteenth- century thought seems based almost exclusively on Lancelot Law Whyte's somewhat anecdotal The Unconscious Before Freud (1962). In short, she asserts the paradigmatic function of George Henry Lewes' and Herbert Spencer's psychological thinking, without at least suggesting that she has thoroughly surveyed the other strains of-largely introspective and, later,</page><page sequence="4">498 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE experimental-psychology viable in the period. Such shorthand notation calls for caution from the reader. This work is not exclusively primary scholarship. It is interpretive and highly synthetic, despite the introduc- tion's claim that "the essays which comprise this volume are case studies" (p. 16). They are that, but their rhetoric might incline readers to take them as more broadly and comprehensively authoritative than they really are about the "the languages of nature" in eighteenth- and nineteeth- century science and literature. An incautious reading would do both the volume and the new interdisciplinary focus it explores a serious disser- vice. ED BLOCK, JR. Marquette University</page></plain_text>
