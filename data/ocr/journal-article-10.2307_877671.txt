<plain_text><page sequence="1">KIRK VARNEDOE Early Drawings by Auguste Rodin RODIN's drawings reflect the mixture of eclectic and individual stylist within his personality. In his early academies and rococo chalk studies, as in his drypoints and charcoal portraits, he easily adopted stylistic guises to suit specific tastes or to respond to different materials.1 His draughts- manship was clearly dominated, on the other hand, by two major modes, each of strong internal consistency and long duration, and each highly personal. The second manner, dating from c. 1896, is the more familiar: rapid pencil studies, and simplified water-colours, of the female nude. The first, without the live model, in diverse, often mixed media, has been called Rodin's imaginative, Dantesque, or black manner, and its drawings frequently associated with The Gates of Hell.2 In a recent essay, while pointing out the impediments to accurate ordering of Rodin's drawings, we proposed a general chronology. We dealt at length with the question of a terminus date for this early manner, but its origins could be only roughly situated, in the early I86o's, on the basis of secondary evidence.3 By examining hitherto unpublished drawings from Rodin's early student years, it is now possible to fix these origins more firmly, and to illustrate some of the influences behind this mode of expression. Fig.36, inscribed in primer-book extravagance Vase Sculp- ture/ Trouvi ' Pergame, is copied from a vase still on display in the Louvre (Fig.37). Fig.39 is taken from a Bacchus relief formerly in the museum court (Fig.4o),4 and its verso (Fig.4I), clumsily renders the pose of the Borghese Gladiator. The verso of Fig.36, though stylistically contemporary (Fig.38), does not seem to be a copy, but rather a figure from imagination, or life. The heavy-handed pencil work and awkward proportions of these drawings indicate a relatively untrained hand; yet the detailing of anatomy suggests some study. Such a mixed character, shared by all the drawings in this small 1 For examples of these various types of work, see the illustrations in my essay 'Rodin as a Draftsman-A Chronological Perspective', in A. ELSEN and J. K. T. VARNEDOE: The Drawings of Rodin, New York [1971], pp.25-12o. The present article stems in part from my doctoral thesis, and I express my deepest gratitude to Albert Elsen for his guidance and friendship as my thesis advisor. My studies would have been impossible without the cooperation of Mme C6cile Gold- scheider, formerly Conservateur du Mus6e Rodin; I am grateful to her for allowing me to study drawings in the Mus6e Rodin collection, and for supplying photos. I also wish to thank M. Jacques Thirion, Conservateur en Chef du D6partment des Sculptures, Mus6e du Louvre, for his patient help, and M Jean Adh6mar, Conservateur en Chef du Cabinet des Estampes, Bibliotheque Nationale, for facilitating my research. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the generous financial support given by the National Gallery of Art, Washing- ton, D.C., in the form of a David E. Finley Fellowship. 2The best published selection of these drawings is the rare Maison Goupil album, Les Dessins de Auguste Rodin, Paris [1897]. G. GRAPPE recognized the insufficiences of the traditional grouping of the early drawings, even in per- petuating them by classing them under the single heading 'Etudes pour la Porte de L'Enfer', in his Catalogue du Musde Rodin, Paris [1929, 1931, 1934, 1938, 1944]. 3 VARNEDOE, loc. cit., PP.37-42 and 60-2. L. BE'NEIDITE was the first to note the diversity among the early drawings, and remarked: 'Ces dessins ne sont pas datis et Rodin n'a pu me fixer sur ce point, car ils n'ont pas eti tracds de suite, mais de temps d autre, d des ipoques un peu diffirents', in 'Dante et Rodin', Dante - Receuil d'itudes publiees pour le VIe centenaire du poite, Paris [I921], p.216. 4 This relief is now undergoing conservation work and could not be photo- graphed. The illustration is from F. DE CLARAC; Musde de Sculpture Antique ou Moderne, Paris [1851], Tome II, Premiere partie, pl.i139.

Of particular significance, given such a date, is the icorckhI treatment of Fig.38, and the similar handling of the Bacchus (Fig.39). This body type, with bald head, summary features, and exaggerated delineation of musculature, dominates the corpus of imaginative drawings, which focus almost exclusively on the male nude in heroic physique. Fig.42, in confident, fluid line and with knowledgeable anatomy, exemplifies the type fully developed; within a continuity of motif and approach, the recently uncovered verso (Fig.43) points up the span of development in this figural manner. In Louvre studies Figs.36 and 39, as in this latter, closely comparable group, the nascent methodology is evident at a very crude level and early date. Though 6corchi, or simply over-muscled, figures can be found in artistic tradi- tions of which Rodin no doubt became aware,7 the evidence thus supports Albert Elsen's suggestion that the style derives from Lecoq de Boisbaudran's instruction rather than from imitation of an external source.8 Beyond figure type, the early drawings show a strong consistency, too, in their narrowed range of expression; fear, violent passion, and suffering, both psychological and physical, are only rarely relieved by maternal tenderness. These emotions are embodied in a pattern of gesture that returns consistently to formulae of self-address, conflicting internal axes, and extremes of extension and compression, within formats of dense composition in shallow space. Diverse iconographies are visualized in these highly similar forms, pointing up a phenomenon more generally observed in the artist's later sculpture: Rodin's compositions and poses frequently evolved independently of fixed icono- graphical intention. When called on to illustrate a subject, he returned to previous works, and, with varying amounts of modification, adapted them to the desired theme. Con- versely, on returning to some previous creations, he found that they suggested additional thematic applications. In later life, the basic unit of this work was the sculpted figure or figure fragment derived from the active living model; in the formative years, as further drawings illustrate, many dominant visual 'sets' derived from early experiences of traditional models. The composition of Fig.44 is taken from a Louvre bas- relief now assigned to the French School of the sixteenth- century (Fig.45); the former attribution to Daniele da Volterra, or Daniele Ricciarelli, explains Rodin's mis-spelt inscription daniel riccialerri.9 In his quick copy of the relief, Rodin immediately reduces the Renaissance styling to blunter, abbreviated forms, eliminating drapery and emphasizing muscular divisions. Figs.46 and 47 show subsequent adaptations of the copied format, retaining its flanking figures, extended central body, and closing wall of background forms. In Fig.48, though the elements are basically unchanged, the handling, particularly the wash, alters the impact. The recumbent figure now twists spasmodically, while the two bracket poses have been compressed to seated or crouching stances, and the rear wall of bodies has become suffocatingly dense; the grace of the original composition has been everywhere suppressed. In Fig.46, the format has been adapted to represent a specific scene: Ugolino chewing on the head of the Archbishop as Dante and Virgil look on (Inferno, c.32, v.I24 ff.). Rodin also inscribed the name Guidon, indicating that he considered the composition equally applicable to the story of Count Guido da Montefeltro (Inferno, c.27). (The Victor Hugo inscription records a further reconsideration of this image, as late as 1886, in connection with the work on the Monu- ment to Victor Hugo). In Fig.47 mount-sheet inscriptions (not visible here) designate a staging of the struggle between St Francis and the black cherubs for the soul of Count Guido, as evoked in Inferno c.27, v. I 12 ff. The composition derives from another Louvre relief, a sixteenth-century imitation formerly classed among the antiquities (Fig.49).-10 Still of early date on stylistic grounds, but perhaps preceded by an intermediary copy, the drawing clearly illustrates once again Rodin's rephrasing of the classical vocabulary; each pose is made more rigid, each physique undraped and in knotty 6corch, and the scene as a whole more compact and severe. In a subsequent and technically advanced variant (Fig.5I), the central horizontal figure has been replaced by a slab, identified as the table de la foi, more figures have been eliminated, and the closure of the back plane more clearly asserted. The principal elements, isolated and modified, are 5 As organized by Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, the Petite Ecole prescribed a programme of graduated steps in learning to draw. Only after arriving at the '4e degri d'enseignement' were the students to copy in the museums; this is also the stage at which they began anatomy instruction (see note 8). Thus Rodin would have taken up this type of Louvre copy early, but only after some basic training. See H. LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN; Lettres a un jeune professeur, Paris [1876], p.36 and pp.42-46. 6 See j. CLADEL: Rodin, sa vie glorieuse et inconnue, Paris [Edition D6finitive, 19521, pp.77-78, for Rodin's student activity. T. H. BARTLETT, drawing from interviews with Rodin c.I887, wrote that 'He remained in this school [the Petite Ecole] for three years, drawing and modelling in the morning and evening, and drawing at the Louvre in the afternoon ... Though Auguste had no master at the Louvre, he soon found a permanent one in his love for and study of the antique, which soon became the only one he ever acknowledged'. ('Auguste Rodin, Sculptor', American Architect and Building News [1889], reprinted in A. ELSEN, ed.; Auguste Rodin: Readings on his Life and Work, Englewood Cliffs [1965], p.I7). 7 Among reinforcing influences would be diverse mannerist prints in the albums of prints after Renaissance masters that Rodin studied in the library (CLADEL [x9521, p.78). In the repository of prints from which Rodin drew, the Cabinet des Estampes of the present Bibliotheque Nationale (then Biblioth~que Imperiale), see particularly the prints after Michelangelo, with heavily exaggerated musculature: four volumes under c6te Ba. 6, in-fol., cf. especially Tome I, Nos 84-87, and Tome II, Nos. ioo-Ig. Mus6e Rodin 6236, a partial copy of the twisting pose of the central seated bather in Michelangelo's cartoon for the Battle of Cascina, witnesses to the artist's study of such images. The practice of producing icorchi study figures was, furthermore, so widespread in the early nineteenth century that a listing of examples would be pointlessly long. a ELSEN: Rodin, New York [x963], p.162. The description of the process of producing these living icorchls is described by LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN [1876], PP-45-47- 9 B.

Ce bas-relief, qui afait partie du Musde des Monuments Frangais est attribul par M. A. Lenoir, qui n'en indique pas la provenance, d Daniele Ricciarelle'. The verso of this drawing (Fig.44), not illustrated here, is another rendering of the Borghese Gladiator; thus the sheet fits convincingly with the other Louvre copies, despite a less laboured handling. 10 CLARAC [1851], p.770, No.332. CLARAc's notes indicate a general acceptance of the relief as imitation antique, and thus it is now displayed. 198</page><page sequence="3">36. Study of a Pergamon Vase, by Auguste Rodin.

The iconography of the Funerailles, like that of many of Rodin's black drawings, is open to speculation." These were wholly private, even hermetic, works. However, despite their mystery, and their highly personal facture, they remain outside the tradition of truly fantasist or visionary draughtsmanship. Rodin's search was for an important, serious art based on human form both potent and noble; the intense drawings that record this work retain in very significant ways the classicism that provided both their substructure and their author's measuring standard. Rodin's fantasy only rarely ventured a creature beyond those, such as the centaur, of traditional canon; when it did, the images are almost exclusively anthropomorphic, and are explicable, unlike those of Redon for example, in specific literary inconographies. He never availed himself of the flames, fantastic geology, and huge scale differences by which Flaxman, Blake, Dord and others (including Dante himself, in his descriptions) characterized the Inferno; he visualized, as later he would in sculpture, in terms of isolated individual drama, impersonal and symbolic more often than specifically narrative. Even in his boldest wash applications, Rodin demonstrates a classicist conservatism in the rarity of his challenges, not only to bodily integrity and scale, but to gravity as well. Paradoxically, though the images are closer to nature in this sense, they are totally artificial in light and setting, and thus distinct from the work of vision- aries like Redon and Hugo who drew on effects of light and landscape derived from a romantic view of nature.12 On the other hand, the impulsive line, exaggerated tensions of pose, and grave mood of even the earliest of these drawings evince an opposition to the dictums of balance, grace, and restraint inherent in the forms from which they derive;13 the internal tensions in the mode are exacerbated as Rodin's personal stylistic inflections become more marked, in bolder line and tenebristic wash. This blend of evident classic and Renaissance form with ex- pressive handling (reflected to a lesser extent in The Man With the Broken Nose c.I864) suggests none of Rodin's contemporaries so much as it does the baroque character that marked some of the best early nineteenth-century draughtsmanship; it brings to mind Gericault in particular.14 The focused aims and multiple means of Rodin's early man- ner, however, indicate an artist for whom the matter of his work - developing understanding of the emotive gesture of the body, in sculptural terms - dominated and determined considerations of technique; apparent affinities with other artists seem more properly evidences of a community of spirit than of influence in any decisive sense. Given the enduring single-mindedness and completely private nature of this mode, the most valid explanations for modifications in style would hinge not on external models but on an under- standing of Rodin's changing attitudes toward his art as a whole. Thus the advent of the boldest blacks, heavily charged with ink and gouache, stemmed from Rodin's reevaluation of his sculpture in the period 1877 -82. The experience of Michelangelo (during an 1875 trip to Italy) stimulated, and the I88o commission for The Gates of Hell catalysed, a crisis in the long-established tug between Rodin's tendency toward more active facture and emphatic form and his dedication to the antique, eventually producing as decisive a third element: the direct study of the unrestrain- ed living form. Confronted with the commission for The Gates, Rodin returned to his fund of studies and sought to extract a series of images suitable to monumental archi- tectural sculpture. The early sketches for the doors (Fig.52) show an assemblage of eight crowded bas-relief composi- tions that refer back to models such as Figs.45 and 49; they also suggest a more specific source. The number of reliefs in these early sketches, and their common density of format do not accord with Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise, the usually cited source, so closely as with another portal, which stood in the Salle des Caryatides of the Louvre during Rodin's youth (Fig.53).15 Designed by Charles Percier in 18 11, this latter door held eight bronze reliefs by Andrea Riccio, taken from the tomb of the della Torre in Verona, in I797. The reliefs illustrate the life and death of Girolamo della Torre; three of them, showing the Maladie, Mort, and Descente aux enfers respectively, particularly correlate to Rodin's Dantesque themes, and there is evidence that Rodin drew from at least one of these works. Fig.54, whose base pencil work (and verso) argue for an early date, is inscribed on the lower left maladie, and on the lower right, arguably, riccio; the image is drawn from Riccio's Maladie de della Torre (Fig.55), and two other drawings further testify to Rodin's interest in the com- position's central group.16 The Percier portal was disas- 11 The drawing was entitled Funerailles in the 1897 Goupil album (see note 2), and in the sale of the collection of Octave Mirbeau, Durand-Ruel, Paris, 24th February 1919, No.37. The Mirbeau catalogue, noting the apparent turban on the standing figure at left, stated: 'II semble que l'on soit dans l'intirieur de quelque pagode o&amp;" va s'accomplir une ciremoniefundraire.' 12 Prof. Jacques de Caso suggested to me that Rodin's wash manner might owe something to Hugo's extremely unusual drawings (see P. GEORGEL: Dessins de Victor Hugo, Paris and Villequiers [1971], among others). I believe that fundamental differences of technique and content argue against this, but space does not permit a full consideration here. I direct the interested reader to my doctoral thesis 'Chronology and Authenticity in the Drawings of Auguste Rodin', Stanford University [June 1972], available through University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Mich. 13 Rodin's instruction was not rigidly oriented to the worship of the antique, and this may have influenced the liberties that he took with his sources. LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN [1876], p.36, counselling on the professor's guidance of museum copies, cautioned: 'Si grande que puisse etre son admiration pour les maitres, il [the professor] n'oubliera pas que les jeunes gens, tout en les copiant, les itudiant avec passion, ne doivent pas s'absorber sans reserve dans l'imitation de leurs oeuvres, afin de conserver intact ce qu'il y a de si pr'cieux pour un artiste: son sentiment intime et sa propre initiative'. 14 The connections between Gericault's pen and gouache drawings and those of Rodin's developed early manner are all the more striking for their common themes. Both attracted by the antique, both strongly affected by Michelangelo, both stimulated by morbid tragedy and violent eroticism, the two men produced many works whose similarity is more than superficial; see for example Louvre RF5176, 26.737, and 26.738 by Gericault, or the illustrations opposite pp.64 and 304 in COURTHION, ed.: Giricault Raconti par lui-meme et ses amis, Paris [1947]. 15 See the discussion of the Percier portal by Mlle Genevieve Monnier in the exhibition catalogue Dessins d'Architecture du XIVe au XIXe sidcle, Musde du Louvre, Paris [1972]. For further illustration of Rodin's early sketches for The Gates, see ELSEN: Rodin's Gates of Hell, Minneapolis [1960], plates 33, 36, 39, 40, 42, and 43. 18 The two drawings are: Musde Rodin No.2054 (pencil, ink, and gouache on tracing paper, 121 by 5 in. [127 X 313 mm.]), which includes the collapsing central figure on the left of a long multi-figure composition; and another drawing known only through its reproduction in MAILLARD: Auguste Rodin, Statuaire, Paris [18991, P.47. The latter is entitled simply 'Etude pour 1'enfer', but 201</page><page sequence="6">EARLY DRAWINGS BY AUGUSTE RODIN sembled in the early I850's; but, especially in the face of other evidence for Rodin's reconsideration of sources experienced in very early youth, it seems useful to make this addition to the possible background of the Gates of Hell.17 When he returned to such long-nurtured formulae as Figs.45, 49 and 55, in light of the experience of Michelangelo and after the achievement of two major free-standing figures (The Age of Bronze in 1877, and St John the Baptist Preaching in 1878), Rodin found that these groups would not give back the force he tried to invest in them. Heavily oriented toward a strict bas-relief concept, the figures of the early drawings were all in profile and frontal views, or almost Egyptian combinations thereof (cf. transformations of pose in Figs.44 and 47), with only a minimum of fore- shortening and no reference to the movement of the figure in deeper space. Heavy reworkings in pen, wash, and gouache, probably beginning in the later 1870's, revitalized many of the drawings, producing simplified masses, more dramatic relief, and a greater sense of depth; but in the focused search for the form of the Gates, old approaches eventually proved fundamentally inadequate to new ideas. As the documented development of the Gates shows, and as he stated,s8 Rodin finally turned away from the drawings, abandoning not only the particular images he had evolved, and classical archetypes in general, but also the implicit concept of monumentality through shallow relief density, in favour of nature as a fund of more truthful, more dramatic, and more varied gesture. Rodin's tendency to isolate and recombine key figures had produced drawn compositions that, for all their com- pression, were fragmented and additive (Fig.48); when he turned to the non-contextual pose of the active model as his visual unit, this methodology produced the more obvious- ly disjunctive couplings and incoherent larger compositions that determine the visual and psychological qualities of the Gates. Though Rodin continued to reconsider the earlier drawings throughout the I88o's (see his Baudelaire illustra- tions of 1888), they became secondary, and, in the final Gates, only the subdued bas-reliefs of the side panels and The Thinker show their direct influence.19 These drawings are perhaps even more valuable to us in view of their distance from Rodin's realized sculpture. For the I86o's and most of the I87o's, drawing was for Rodin not only a method of learning, but also a primary means of expression, of combining knowledge with invention in a personal fashion impossible in the sculpture of his apprentice labours. These drawings inform us of the impact of his training and the character of his imagination, exposing both his debts and his originality, in the otherwise poorly documented period of his formation. As a group, they embody Rodin's particular alternating pulse of rapid execution and long conservation, of brief inspiration and laborious reflection, of multifarious creation and narrow selection. the partially legible inscription seems to include the words 'Christ', 'eau', and 'vin', suggesting that the figure of della Torre here represents Christ at the Marriage in Cana. 17 In regard to the dismounting of the portal, see the letter of L. DE LABORDE to Nieuwerkerke of 3oth July, 1850, in Bulletin de la Socilti de L'Histoire de L'Art FranGais [ I934], pp.299-300; my thanks to M Jacques Thirion for this reference. Percier's drawing (Fig.53), was given to the Louvre in 1854 (see note 15 above), and it is conceivable that Rodin could have seen it during his frequent visits to the museum at that time. 18 Rodin was quoted by s. BASSET; 'La Porte de L'Enfer', Le Matin [Igth March Igoo], p.i: . . . 'au bout d'un an je me suis aperfu que ces dessins, s'ils rendaient ma vision de Dante, n' taient pas assez proches de la realiti. Etj'ai tout recommence, d'aprgs nature, travaillant avec mes modiles'. See our reference to ELSEN'S previous citation of this quote, and our interpretation of its bearing on the development of the drawings, in VARNEDOE, loc. cit., pp.60-62. l1 The various architectural sketches seem to show a shift away from the idea of bas-relief groups, and hence a rejection of preserved images such as Fig.46, in favour of more compact, simple, one- and two-figure groups (The Thinker, The Kiss) found amongst the drawings, and finally the dominance, in the main portal panels, of a flux of small figures not dependent on previous drawings. In the 'Second architectural clay model' (ELSEN [1960], plate 40), the upper left lintel figures seem to come from the drawing of men tearing each other's flesh, entitled Les Hiertiques in the 1897 Dessins album (plate xo). The lower right couple in the same model also derives from a drawing, Mus&amp;e Rodin 56og, inscribed d faire/groupe ronde bosse/avec la figurine accroupie/Mephistos; this couple is preserved in the final Gates, at the base of the right side panel. Directly above them in the final version, a woman fends off a man who reaches up to her. This group is found later as Rodin's illustration for Baudelaire's De Profundis Clamavis, and has four related drawings in the Mus&amp;e Rodin: Nos.376, 1913, I947, and 7109; still another version is reproduced in the 1897 Dessins album, plate 78, L'Etoile. The two seated couples in the 'Third architectural clay model' (ELSEN [Ig60], plate 44), one of which survives as The Kiss, have drawn prototypes too numerous to list. The same is true of The Thinker, who, like the caryatid figures on the Vase of the Titans (see H. W. JANSON: 'Rodin and Carrier-Belleuse: the Vase des Titans', Art Bulletin, L [1968], pp.278-8o), blends the body type and pose tension of the imaginative drawings with distinct Michelangelesque influence; at least part of The Thinker's heritage lies in the right mourning figure of Fig.49. Finally, both Mus6e Rodin Nos.5623 and 1921 are direct, though compositionally reversed, prototypes for the bas- relief couple at the top of the left side panel of The Gates, also known as Vaine Tendresse (GRAPPE [1931], No.232).</page><page sequence="7">46.
