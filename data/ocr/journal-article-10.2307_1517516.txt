<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES ment is in anthropomorphic terms. The fact that there is no consistency or pattern in the adoption of substitues for the term YHWH and that a substitution may appear alongside a direct reference to YHWH sug- gests the emergence of scruples about direct reference to the personal- ised Deity. A feature in the development processes in religious and social life, as well as in the sphere of language, is that innovations which enter the pattern of existing practices do not immediately oust those practices. They are often used alongside current custom and only later become fixed and permanent. While it would be fair to say that 'the Name' is a substitute for 'YHWH', expressions such as trN' tn 'Tp, 'the Holy One of Israel' so frequently found in Isaiah (e.g. i 4, etc.) and '7rtr nal 'the Splendour of Israel' (1 Sam. xx 29) do not seem to be substitutes for 'YHWH' for reasons of scruple but, rather, alternative expressions for 'God' in which reference is made to his special attributes and his unique relationship with Israel.

WEINGREEN nnb" = 1p3 "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe" (1 Sam. xii 11). The appearance of the name 1T among the well-known figures of Jerubbaal, Jephthah and Samuel in the verse cited above has been a source of difficulty from the inception of Biblical interpretation, for the book of Judges fails to make any mention whatsoever of this judge and saviour 1). According to Targum Jonathan pt;l is none other than Samson, a variant apparently based upon a midrashic tradition (B. Talmud, Rosh Hashonah 25 a): "Why is he called Bedan? Because he came 1) It would appear that the mention of the name Samuel is also problematic for (a) the speaker would then be referring to himself and not in the first person, and (b) Samuel is not one of the "saviour judges". We should not allow ourselves to be misled by the Lucianic and Peshitta rendition of Pfltt, due to the partial graphic similarity, for we should not invalidate the possibility that traditions concerning Samuel existed which were not included in the canonical work bearing his name. Such a tradition is hinted at in 1 Sam. vii 15 "And Samuel judged Israel...", an accepted formula concerning the saving judges, and also in his role during the war described in the same chapter. That he refers to himself is only an artificial difficulty, if we do not forget that the speaker is not Samuel, and the speechwriter who attached the script to Samuel failed by revealing himself through his inclusion of the name Samuel in the same list.

R, DRIVER, Notes on the Hebrew Text of Samuel, Oxford 1913, p. 94. 123</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTES from Dan"; (David Kimhi): "And the meaning of Bedan is the son of Dan (17 7:) for he is of the family of Dan" 1). The obvious problem in this explanation is the mention of a judge's non personal name amongst three personal names (furthermore, the name Bedan appears as a personal name c.f. the verse which may enable us to ascertain the solution to our difficulty-1 Chr. vii 17) 2). Another more minor difficulty is the fact that Samson is mentioned before Jephthah, whereas the other three judges are mentioned in order of their appear- ance in Scripture: Jerubbaal, Jephthah, Samuel. Additionally, the reading of the Septuagint and Peshitta p': for M.T. 7:a is not satisfactory. Whether or not we are here presented with a conspicuous attempt to substitute the graphically closely- related name of a judge for that of 1a (similar to the exchanging of Ip^7 for 7ttlnZ) 3), or whether the more problematic reading was replaced by an easier one in some non-identifiable manner, still we are left with the difficulty in the chronological order of the judges, for Barak preceded Jerubbaal4). EWALD'S suggestion5) to effect a slight change in the text, thereby reading 'rly, is not only difficult in that it is not supported by any textual evidence, but also because it brings into the picture one of the minor, insignificant judges (Jud. xii 13-15). Moreover, in the Book of Judges Jepthah precedes Abdon. It would appear then that the best means of identifying the missing judge is not by searching for a name closely resembling p=. It would be better to refer to the second occurrence of the name prn, in 1 Chr. vii 17. Jt:a appears in a genealogical list as a descendent of the tribe of Manasseh (ibid. vss. 14-19)-from the family of Gilead "and the sons of Ulam Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh" 6). It is no coincidence that 1) For the possibility of : at the beginning of a personal name meaning 73 i.e., "son of", see B.

R. SMITH, Samuel I.C.C., Edinburgh 1912, p. 86; M. S.

The conclusion arising out of their asso- ciation in our verse, and out of the fact that they are both Gilead's sons (N.B. Jephthah does not appear in the genealogical list of the tribe of Manasseh) is that p3Z is none other than Jephthah. At first Bedan alone appeared in the list, whose chronological order suits the description of Judges. A reconstruction of the verse would read: "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Samuel." Just as the judge Jerubbaal-Gideon had two names (or, one could say, two different traditions of his name have been handed down to us), so did Jephthah-the difference being that the Book of Judges contains only one tradition concerning Jephthah. The mention of the name Bedan was already a problem of interpretation in early times. Hence, one copyist or redactor who knew the common identity of Bedan inserted the name Jephthah into the text. A later copyist, who was ignorant of the explanatory purpose of the word Jephthah added the article nl1 before the name nnm. Thus was created the problematic reading found in the M.T. Jerusalem (Isr.) Y. ZAKOVITCH to Gilead; and it appears that the name Gilead should be substituted for Machir in verses 15 and 16. See forex.: E. L. CURTIS, Chronicles I.C.C., Edinburgh 1910, p. 153. 125</page></plain_text>
