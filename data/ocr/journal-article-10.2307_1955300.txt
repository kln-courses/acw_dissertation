(New York: St. Martin's Press, 1967. Pp. xvi, 490. $13.45.) Professor Jordan's polemic is aimed against the twin pillars of the edifice of Marxist the- ory: (i) the science of historical materialism (HM) and (ii) the philosophy of dialectical materialism (DM), the epistemological meta- theory of the science. He conducts the polemic via a two-pronged attack: (1) He rejects the view that a monolithic doctrine can be extracted from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. He splits the monolith by displaying theoretical ruptures, first between Marx and Engels, second between Marx-Engels and Lenin-Stalin (the latter rup- ture being uneasily bridged by Plekhanov). The claim here is that since Marx was not a philosophical materialist, he could not have been the father of the philosophical doctrine of DM; and since Marx had no coherent the- ory of history, if he was the father of HM, then HM too is incoherent. (2) He rejects DM (now orphaned) on nu- merous grounds, most importantly because it allegedly infringes Popper's principle that a theory must be refutable if it is not to be mere metaphysics. The following two arguments, from the first prong of the attack, are representative of the general level of the polemic: (a) "Anthropological naturalism" (pp. 16- 64). Jordan distinguishes materialism from naturalism. According to him, anthropological naturalism asserts "the priority of external na- ture" but abolishes the distinction between man and nature. From this arises the phenomeno- logical view that the concept of nature is "a social and historical concept," i.e., the "social construction of reality." He defines material- ism in reductivist terms: in history it "iden- tifies the absolutely primary factor of history with some extraneous physical factor"; in so- cial science it claims that "every sociological statement is logically reducible to a conjunc- tion of psychological statements which them- selves are reducible to statements about physio- logical or chemico-physical states of the hu- man organism" (p. 54). Having thus charac- terized the two positions, he concludes that since Marx did not maintain the latter, and since the former can be extracted from cer- tain of his texts, Marx was an anthropological naturalist, not a materialist. The beauty of this conclusion for Jordan is that it effectively im- munizes Marx's theory from having any effect on historical or sociological explanation, since anthropological naturalism is essentially a non- causal, nonscientific ideology. But the conclu- sion does not in fact follow from the premisses presented, because anthropological naturalism is not the only alternative to reductive ma- terialism to be found in Marx's texts. On the contrary, his mature texts provide the elements of a theory different from either reductive ma- terialism or anthropological naturalism, namely the theory of determination by the mode of production. If by semantic fiat Jordan forbids us to call this theory materialism, nothing is lost (a rose by any other name . . .). The im- portant principle is that we should not be driven into the innocuous vacuity of natural- ism for fear of the unacceptable consequences of reductivism. (Note the innocent contempt for periodization of Marx's works, as Jordan extracts "Marx's philosophy" from selected passages of the 1844 Manuscripts, The Ger- man Ideology and Capital 1.7.) (b) Marx and history (pp. 297-318). Here Jordan returns to the central concept of HM, determination by the mode of production. He distinguishes two theories within Marx's writ- ings, the one "methodological," the other "meta- physical." The methodological theory, according to Jor- dan, is not concerned with the ontological rela- tionship of base to superstructure, but rather with "the principle of evolution and conform- ity of human behaviour to natural laws of co- existence and succession." Its basic assump- tion is that men's behavior and ideologies cor- respond to their material production and more specifically that ideological domination corre- sponds to economico-political domination. Posed in such general terms the theory is clear- ly untestable. Yet when in his political texts Marx makes the theory more specific, by dem- onstrating connections between the economic, political and ideological levels as reflected in the political class struggle, Jordan deems these developments of the theory illegitimate, and thus condemns the theory to the realm of un- testable non-science (pp. 305-6). But even if Marx had appeared to produce a testable the- ory, Jordan could have trumped his card: "If Marx believed that his theory of history could be validated by testing the conclusions de- rived from it, as a hypothesis of natural sci- ence is tested, he was surely on the wrong track; it is clear today that no historical hy- pothesis can be validated in this way" (p. 305). Since Jordan apparently identifies scientific method with the hypothetico-deductive method (e.g., pp. 196, 200, 316), it follows that his- tory for him is not a science, indeed that it cannot yield knowledge in the normal sense at all: "Marx held the naive belief, common</page><page sequence="2">1975 Book Reviews 1425 at the time [sic] . . . that one and only one point of view can truly fit historical facts (p. 316). The metaphysical theory (Jordan's name for the theory which causally relates base to super- structure) is rejected, first, because it cannot be validated, and second, because it employs theoretical entities (productive forces and pro- ductive relations) which are unreal: ". . . dis- tinguishable from each other in thought only, not in fact . . . The construct of productive forces has a connotation but no denotation" (p. 310). This latter objection has now been largely overcome by E. Balibar, G. A. Cohen, and others, in their distinction between eco- nomic capacities and juridical rights and pow- ers. To Jordan's statement: ". . . the modern supporters of the Marxian theories should be able to answer this objection" (p. 310), the answer is that Balibar already had in 1965. The first objection, concerning validation, still stands in need of a full theoretical reply, but one can be sure in advance, from the argu- ments cited above, that Jordan will rule out any such attempts as illegitimate. He has pro- duced the perfectly self-validating prediction. In this "philosophical and sociological anal- ysis," philosophy is used to attack the logical structure of the theories, and sociology to ex- plain how such illogical systems came to be im- posed. But the sociological component is light- weight, consisting of the single reductivist no- tion of "socio-centric cosmology." The DM of Plekhanov, Lenin and Stalin is explained as a crude anthropomorphism which "first ascribes certain distinctively social attributes . . . to the universe, and having construed it as a socio- cosmic structure, derives from the order of the universe the basic characteristics of human so- ciety" (p. 206). This account has a certain intuitive appeal but lacks serious theoretical credentials. Jordan finds the real (?) origin and point of return of the ideological system in "a universe brimming over with strife, con- flict and contradictions," which "offers self- evident advantages for a social and political theory based on the concept of class-antago- nism": this "was the case with Plekhanov and continues to be so in the Soviet philosophy of today" (p. 205). The implications of the "ex- planation" seem to be first that there is no class-antagonism in capitalist countries since DM is not dominant in them, and second that the situation facing Plekhanov was identical, in relevant respects, with that facing Soviet philosophers today. Since these conclusions are evidently false, the "explanation" must be abandoned or radically modified, otherwise Jordan's own comment applies: "A theory that does not take any risk of being refuted has no scientific content" (p. 196). (In fact the first steps towards relating ideological develop- ments under Stalinism to the class struggle have been made by N. Poulantzas in Fascisme et Dictature, a work firmly based on the funda- mental concepts of HM.) The book is excellently documented; the logical distinctions are lucid and many of the refutations of specific theses are more elegant than those of earlier critiques. But the polemic as a whole is profoundly ambivalent, reflecting the ambivalence of the author's own theoretical stance. His attitude towards history is totally skeptical, involving epistemological relativism and the assumption that history cannot fulfill the criteria of scientific discourse (pp. 308, 316). Yet elsewhere he champions the scien- tificity of history when he denounces the im- position of extraneous "methodological prin- ciples upon the natural, social and historical sciences" (p. 395). He uses relativism to ex- clude the very possibility of HM; he uses Pop- per's falsificationism to exclude DM and also to cope with the more specific theses of HM. Yet relativism and falsificationism are incom- patible. Perhaps the ambivalences all stem from the curious conception of philosophy presented on p. 269: "Philosophy in the Socratic sense is a way of life characterized by devotion to truth and love of wisdom. Philosophy in a more pedestrian sense means submission to an in- tellectual discipline, the acceptance of logical rules and factual evidence, which enable others to ask questions...." These criteria are de- signed to exclude Stalin from the class of philosophers, which they succeed in doing. But they fail to mark off philosophy from any other rigorous intellectual practice. The formu- lation is entirely empty and symbolizes the lack of any coherent account of the role of the epistemologist in political theory. Without such an account, this kind of philosophical polemic is doomed to failure. TIMOTHY O'HAGAN University of East Anglia, England</page></plain_text>
