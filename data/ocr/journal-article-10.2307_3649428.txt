<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEXTUALISM AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT John F. Manning* F OR much of our history, the Supreme Court has unflinchingly proclaimed that legislative "intent" is the touchstone of federal statutory interpretation.' The rationale is familiar: In a constitu- tional system predicated upon legislative supremacy (within consti- tutional boundaries), judges-as Congress's faithful agents-must try to ascertain as accurately as possible what Congress meant by the words it used. On this premise, federal judges long assumed that when a statute was vague or ambiguous, interpreters should seek clarification, if possible, in the bill's internal legislative his- tory.2 Thus, when a sponsor or committee expressed an under- standing of the bill or the mischiefs at which it was aimed, federal courts often took that as probative evidence of the text's meaning.3 And because a legislature-like any other user of language-might speak imprecisely, or use language loosely or idiosyncratically, fed- eral judges long assumed that a statute's semantic detail, however clear, must yield when it conflicts sharply with the apparent spirit or purpose that inspired its enactment.4 For the latter half of the twentieth century, these principles- referred to herein as "classical intentionalism"-reflected the or- thodoxy, at least among federal judges. Near the close of that cen- tury, however, a competing philosophy known as "textualism" * Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.

As discussed below, textualism does not admit of a simple definition, but in practice is associated with the basic proposition that judges must seek and abide by the public meaning of the enacted text, understood in context (as all texts must be). Hence, even in cases of ambiguity, many textualist judges typically refuse to treat legislative history as "authoritative" evi- dence of legislative intent.! Given the undeniable complexity of the legislative process, interpreters simply cannot know if a requisite majority of enactors knew of or assented to the contents of any particular piece of legislative history.6 In addition, textualists choose the letter of the statutory text over its spirit; again, the in- tricacy and opacity of the legislative process make them reluctant to ascribe an apparent mismatch between text and purpose to a lapse in legislative expression rather than the ever-present possibil- ity of an awkward legislative compromise. The leading exponents of modern textualism-Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court and Judge Easterbrook on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit-often justify these deviations from classic intentionalism with an alluring but ultimately inexact proposition: Building on the realist tradition, they emphasize that multi-member legislatures do not have an actual but unexpressed "intent" on any materially contested interpretive point; judges must therefore abandon any pretense of using such an intent as the aim of interpretation.8 Instead, courts should listen for "the ring the ' See John F.

In a characteristically insightful article, Professor Caleb Nelson has suggested that the difference between new textualists and clas- sical intentionalists may not be as cosmic as modern textualist rhetoric sometimes suggests.12 Several considerations, he argues, demonstrate that the leading modern textualists do, in fact, care about Congress's actual rather than objectified intent. A few ex- amples suffice to reveal the gist of his analysis: First, textualists re- ject internal legislative history precisely because they regard a sponsor's or committee's views as an unreliable proxy for the in- tentions of the body as a whole."13 Second, modern textualists some- time sacrifice clear semantic meaning in order to avoid scrivner's errors, a practice that make sense only if one is seeking the true in- tention of the enacting body.14 Third, textualists sometimes even engage in the "imaginative reconstruction" of legislative intent- that is, in some contexts they eschew close textual exegesis and try instead to imagine how the legislature would have resolved a par- Interpretation, 17 Harv.

Such considerations lead Professor Nelson to conclude that textualists talk a good game but in the end want to know the same thing as do intentionalists-what the legislature subjectively intended. They just have different presuppositions about how to read-or, perhaps more accurately, how to approximate-that intent. So what does Professor Nelson see as the salient factor that distinguishes modern textualists from classical intentionalists? Simply put, he detects a heightened tendency among textualists to prefer rules over standards.16 For example, textualists are quick to enforce statutorily embedded rules against the claim that inevitable over- or under-inclusiveness warrants an (intent- based) exception." And they enthusiastically deploy canons of construction, with special emphasis on the more rule-like of the canons."' Given his previous conclusion that textualists seek leg- islative intent, he chalks up their rule-like tendencies to an im- plicit judgment that rule-following will more likely approximate legislative intent. (That is, textualists appear to believe that de- 15 See id. at 404-13. For example, in determining whether to "sever" an unconstitu- tional provision of a statute, the Court inquires into whether Congress would have enacted the balance of the statute without the offending provision. See id. at 404-05. In addition, the Court's approach to implied federal preemption of state law ap- proximates the methods of analysis associated with imaginative reconstruction. See Daniel J. Meltzer, The Supreme Court's Judicial Passivity, 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev. 343, 364-68 (arguing that contrary to its default approach to statutory interpretation, the Court engages in significant interpretive lawmaking in implied preemption cases). 16 See Nelson, supra note 12, at 372-403. For a general discussion of the distinction between rules and standards, see, for example, Isaac Ehrlich &amp; Richard A. Posner, An Economic Analysis of Legal Rulemaking, 3 J. Legal Stud. 257, 258 (1974) (noting that "[a] rule withdraws from the decision maker's consideration one or more of the circumstances that would be relevant to decision" while "[t]he term 'standard' de- notes... a general criterion of social choice," such as efficiency or reasonableness); Louis Kaplow, Rules Versus Standards: An Economic Analysis, 42 Duke L.J. 557, 559-60 (1992) ("[A] rule may entail an advance determination of what conduct is permissible, leaving only factual issues for the adjudicator....

To be sure, textualists have sought to devise a construc- tive intent that satisfies the minimum conditions for meaningfully tracing statutory meaning to the legislative process. That much is uncontroversial. In any system predicated on legislative supremacy, a faithful agent will of course seek the legislature's intended mean- ing in some sense, and modern textualists do situate themselves in that tradition. But to say that they simply practice intentionalism by other means is to understate the important link for textualists between recognizing the cumbersome, chaotic, path-dependent, and opaque character of the legislative process and their rejection (in what may perhaps be overstated rhetoric) of the classical inten- tionalists' understanding of legislative intent. What characterizes classical intentionalism is its tendency to an- thropomorphize the legislature. In important respects, intentional- ists believe that a legislative command can and should be treated as one would treat the speech of an individual human actor. That is, 19 Id. at 381-83. 20 Id. at 389-93. 21 A brief Essay is not the proper venue to pick over whatever minor disagreements I may have with the particulars of Professor Nelson's careful analysis.</page><page sequence="6">424 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 they believe that a legislative majority can have coherent but un- expressed background intentions about its statutory utterances that can be used to clarify or even alter the significance that a reason- able person conversant with relevant social and linguistic conven- tions would otherwise attach to the chosen words in context. Tex- tualists, by contrast, deny that Congress has a collective will apart from the outcomes of the complex legislative process that condi- tions its ability to translate raw policy impulses or intentions into finished legislation. For them, intended meaning never emerges unfiltered; it must survive a process that includes committee ap- proval, logrolling, the need for floor time, threatened filibusters, conference committees, veto threats, and the like. For better or worse, only the statutory text navigates all those hurdles. Accord- ingly, whereas intentionalists believe that legislatures have coher- ent and identifiable but unexpressed policy intentions, textualists believe that the only meaningful collective legislative intentions are those reflected in the public meaning of the final statutory text. This Essay will outline the distinctive conception of legislative intent that follows from the textualists' bedrock assumptions about the legislative process. Part I will lay the groundwork by examining the modern textualists' underlying skepticism of intent. It will then argue that despite this skepticism, textualists necessarily believe in some version of legislative intent, but one that is quite different from the version associated with classical intentionalism. In par- ticular, textualists focus on "objectified intent"-the import that a reasonable person conversant with applicable social and linguistic conventions would attach to the enacted words. Part II will exam- ine the distinction between rules and standards upon which Profes- sor Nelson centrally relies. Although textualists may in practice have a predilection for rules, Part II will suggest that the key to understanding textualism is not such a preference; rather, textual- ism rests on a straightforward conviction that faithful agents must treat rules as rules and standards as standards. Textualists believe it imperative, given the complexities of the legislative process, to re- spect the level of generality at which Congress speaks; for them, legislative compromise is reflected in the detail of the text pro- duced. So they subscribe to the general principle that texts should be taken at face value-with no implied extensions of specific texts or exceptions to general ones-even if the legislation will then</page><page sequence="7">2005] Textualism and Legislative Intent 425 have an awkward relationship to the apparent background inten- tion or purpose that produced it. Before elaborating on this analysis, let me offer two caveats. First, much of Professor Nelson's article thoughtfully culls a defini- tion of textualism from the judicial practices reflected in the writ- ings and opinions of the two leading textualist judges. I will assume arguendo that certain of their practices are consistent with reliance on the subjective intent of classical intentionalism rather than the objective intent that they endorse.22 Rather than focusing on the in- ternal consistency vel non of textualist judicial practice, I will at- tempt to demonstrate that the construct of objectified legislative intent follows from the textualists' articulated theory of the legisla- tive process. In other words, rather than reasoning from textualist practice to theory, I will approach the problem from the opposite direction. Second, in so doing, I will focus my attention on the tex- tualists' antipathy towards sacrificing the letter of the law to its spirit, reserving only marginal discussion for the legislative history debate. Whereas the legislative history debate relates more to the admissibility of certain evidence of meaning, the conflict between letter and spirit raises broader questions about the very nature of interpretation. As I have discussed in prior writing, moreover, the textualist position on legislative history involves complications that 22 Indeed, in previous writing, I argued that textualists' reliance on the absurdity doctrine is difficult to reconcile with their underlying theory of the legislative process and their consequent emphasis on objective legislative intent. See John F. Manning, The Absurdity Doctrine, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2387, 2419-31 (2003). I reserved the ques- tion of whether a true "scrivener's error" doctrine might be reconciled with textual- ism if limited to circumstances in which the text itself revealed an obvious typographi- cal error, rather than a failure to express a policy impulse with sufficient care. See id. at 2459 n.265. Where the text itself reveals an unmistakable error in transcription rather than expression, I suggested that correcting the scrivener's error might not risk disturbing a potential behind-the-scenes "legislative bargain over the precise way a given statutory policy should be articulated." Id. at 2460 n.265. This brief Essay is not the place to address more definitively the appropriateness for textualists of a scriv- ener's error doctrine. Certainly, one could make a plausible case that even a limited doctrine of that sort is inconsistent with the intent skepticism that underlies modern textualism. See John C. Nagle, Textualism's Exceptions, Issues in Legal Scholarship, at 2-4 (Nov. 2002), available at http://www.bepress.com/ils/iss3/artl5 (on file with the Virginia Law Review Association). Whatever the proper resolution of that issue or other questions about specific textualist practices at the margins, it nonetheless ap- pears worthwhile to isolate the basic interpretive framework that follows from the textualists' stated conception of how the legislature works.</page><page sequence="8">426 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 do not map neatly onto questions of subjective versus objective legislative intent.23 With those qualifications in place, I turn now to the textualists' conception of legislative intent. 23 Modern textualists' refusal to rely on legislative history cannot rest on their dis- tinction between subjective and objective intent. As discussed below, textualists be- lieve that objective intent derives from the way a person conversant with applicable social and linguistic conventions would read the words in context. Because the Court assumes that "Congress legislates with knowledge of our basic rules of statutory con- struction," McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991), the Court's longstanding practice of relying on legislative history might suggest that a reasonable legislator conversant with applicable conventions would treat legislative history, no less than an established canon of construction, as an appropriate source of meaning. Accordingly, textualists must look beyond concepts of intent, subjective or objective, to ground their objection to legislative history. In previous writing, I have argued that the textualists' antipathy towards legislative history is better explained as a reflection of the constitutional norm against legislative self-delegation. See Manning, supra note 5, at 710-25. Bicameralism and presentment form an essential component of the constitutional structure, designed to check fac- tional influence, promote caution and deliberation, and provoke public discussion. See John F. Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency In- terpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 649-50 (1996); Manning, supra note 5, at 708-09. To prevent the circumvention of that process, the Court has consis- tently forbidden Congress from reserving delegated authority for its own components, agents, or members. See Metro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 275-77 (1991) ("MWAA") (holding that individ- ual members of Congress may not serve on a tribunal exercising delegated power); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726 (1986) (holding that Congress may not reserve power to remove an officer exercising delegated lawmaking authority); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944-59 (1983) (invalidating a one-House legislative veto). If prevailing rules of interpretation enable Congress to enact vague statutes while sub- delegating policy details to its own components or members, then delegation becomes highly attractive, and an important structural incentive against such a practice is com- promised. See Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 755 (Stevens, J., concurring) ("If Congress were free to delegate its policymaking authority to one of its components, or to one of its agents, it would be able to evade 'the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution.' That danger-congressional action that evades constitutional re- straints-is not present when Congress delegates lawmaking power to the executive or to an independent agency." (footnote omitted) (quoting Chadha, 462 U.S. at 959)). In recent years, some textualists have justified their reluctance to credit internal legis- lative history on the ground that it effectively transfers authority from the body as a whole to the committees or sponsors who, under established judicial practice, are ca- pable of producing particularly "authoritative" expressions of legislative intent. See Manning, supra note 5, at 694-95 (discussing this refinement of the textualist posi- tion). Professor Nelson suggests that the norm against self-delegation is itself relevant only if textualists believe that the contents of a committee report or sponsor's state- ment do not, in fact, reflect the understanding of the legislature as a whole. See Nel- son, supra note 12, at 365, n.53. But even if the elaborations of meaning found in the</page><page sequence="9">2005] Textualism and Legislative Intent 427 I. LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT As a matter of political theory, any conception of judging rooted in the related premises of legislative supremacy and the faithful agent theory is, quite simply, unintelligible without an underlying conception of legislative intent. As Joseph Raz has explained "[i]t makes no sense to give any person or body law-making power unless it is assumed that the law they make is the law they intended to make."24 In particular, he emphasizes: [T]o assume that the law made by legislation is not the one in- tended by the legislator, we must assume that he cannot predict what law he is making when the legislature passes any piece of legislation. But if so, why does it matter who the members of the legislature are, whether they are democratically elected or not, whether they represent different regions in the country, or classes in the population, whether they are adults or children, sane or insane? Since the law they will end by making does not represent their intentions, the fact that their intentions are fool- ish or wise, partial or impartial, self-serving or public spirited, makes no difference. ... [T]he notion of legislation imports the idea of entrusting power over the law into the hands of a person or an institution, and this imports entrusting voluntary control over the develop- ment of the law, or an aspect of it, into the hands of the legisla- tor.25 legislative history potentially reflected some broader understanding, one might none- theless wish to insist upon its expression in a format-the statutory text-that is sub- ject to the full constitutional process of bicameralism and presentment. Only in that way would one have assurance that the norms expressed in a committee report or sponsor's statement reflected not merely the views of a hypothetical legislative major- ity, but also a position capable of surviving the cumbersome and elaborate process of enactment. 24 See Joseph Raz, Intention in Interpretation, in The Autonomy of Law: Essays on Legal Positivism 249, 258 (Robert P. George ed., 1996). 2Id. at 258-59, 265-66.</page><page sequence="10">428 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 Classical intentionalism of course starts from similar premises.26 But as traditionally practiced by the Supreme Court, it refines that basic idea in a crucial respect. Consistent with an important strain of modern language theory, classical intentionalists emphasize that meaning depends on what the speaker actually intends to convey.27 In that sense, classical intentionalists treat Congress much as they would treat an individual speaker: If an individual uses a term that has multiple potential meanings, the true meaning of that term as used on a particular occasion depends on the meaning intended by the speaker.28 So when the words of a statute leave a residue of ambiguity, intentionalists find it appropriate to examine the bill's internal legislative history for further evidence of what members of Congress "intended."29 More important, because people often 26 See, e.g., T. Alexander Aleinikoff, Updating Statutory Interpretation, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 20, 22-25 (1988) (linking intentionalism to legislative supremacy); Philip P. Frickey, From the Big Sleep to the Big Heat: The Revival of Theory in Statutory In- terpretation, 77 Minn. L. Rev. 241, 251-52 (1992) (same). See generally Steven Knapp &amp; Walter Benn Michaels, Against Theory, 8 Critical Inquiry 723 (1982) (articulating the intent-based theory of meaning). In recent years, prominent defenders of classical intentionalism have relied centrally on such language philosophy to support their approach. See Larry Alexander &amp; Saikrishna Prakash, "Is that English You're Speaking?" Why Intention Free Interpretation is an Impossibil- ity, 41 San Diego L. Rev. 967, 974-78 (2004) (explaining the centrality of speaker's intention to the derivation of meaning); Paul Campos, That Obscure Object of De- sire: Hermeneutics and the Autonomous Legal Text, 77 Minn. L. Rev. 1065, 1089 (1993) (same). 28For example, Professors Alexander and Prakash note that the word "cat" may connote, inter alia, "'domestic tabby cat,' 'any feline,' or 'jazz musician."' Alexander &amp; Prakash, supra note 27, at 977. If the person using the word on a particular occasion informs the reader that "he was writing an ode to his beloved tabby," then that inten- tion settles the meaning so that "'cat' here means tabby." Id. For a similarly compel- ling example not grounded in modern language theory, see Frank E. Horack, Jr., In the Name of Legislative Intention, 38 W. Va. L.Q. 119, 120 (1932) ("When X says, 'A big bundle of bills came this morning,' does Y know what X received?... Y is only interested in learning what meaning X is trying to convey."). 29 See, e.g., N.

Rodriguez, The Substance of the New Legal Process, 77 Cal. L. Rev. 919, 931-32 (1989) (book review) (same). 30 Recent legal scholarship has systematically defended atextual and purposive in- terpretation in light of the insights of linguistic pragmatics-a branch of linguistics that purports to explain the way people use language in conversational settings. See, e.g., Geoffrey P. Miller, Pragmatics and the Maxims of Interpretation, 1990 Wis. L. Rev. 1179 (tying certain intentionalist maxims to the premises of linguistic pragmat- ics); M.B.W. Sinclair, Law and Language: The Role of Pragmatics in Statutory Inter- pretation, 46 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 373 (1985) (same). In particular, this legal scholarship has built upon the work of Paul Grice, who contends that typical conversations are cooperative and that the norms of communication should reflect that premise. See Paul Grice, Studies in the Way of Words 26 (1989). From that starting point, Grice then suggests various maxims to implement this "Cooperative Principle." Id. These common-sense norms of conversation include: "Make your contribution as informa- tive as is required" (quantity); "[t]ry to make your contribution one that is true" (quality); "[b]e relevant" (relation); and "[a]void obscurity of expression" (manner). Id. at 26-27. Professors Miller and Sinclair have relied on Grice's insights to justify the sort of strongly purposive interpretation reflected in the Court's traditional pref- erence for spirit over letter and its long-standing practice of interpreting texts to avoid absurd results. See Miller, supra, at 1210-11 (invoking Grice's maxim of quality to de- fend the absurdity doctrine); Sinclair, supra, at 397-99 (using the maxim of quality to defend strong purposivism more generally). In previous writing, I argued that Grice's maxims do not necessarily translate from a conversational setting to "the complex, multilateral bargaining process of framing a statute."

But textualists deny that a legislature has any shared intention that lies behind but differs from the reasonable import of the words adopted; that is, they think it impossible to tell how the body as a whole actually intended (or, more accurately, would have intended) to resolve a policy question not clearly or satisfactorily settled by the text. Building upon the realist tradition, textualists do not believe that the premises governing an individual's intended meaning translate well to a complex, multi-member legislative process.34 As one author has put it, Congress is a "they," not an 32 See, e.g., United States v.

Professor Radin famously doubted that a multi-member legislature could share a coherent specific "intent" on a matter not clearly resolved by the statute itself. See Radin, supra, at 870 ("That the intention of the legislature is undiscoverable in any real sense is almost an immediate inference from a statement of the proposition. The chances that of several hundred [legislators] each will have exactly the same determinate situations in mind... are infinitesimally small.").

Invoking the economic and game-theoretic insights of public choice theory,36 textualists thus emphasize that laws frequently re- flect whatever bargain competing interest groups could strike rather than the fully principled policy judgment of a single-minded majority.37 Moreover, a tortuous and largely opaque legislative process makes it difficult if not impossible for judges to retrace all the steps that contributed to the final wording of the enacted text.38 Bills "must run the gamut of the process," which involves "commit- tees, fighting for time on the floor, compromise because other members want some unrelated objective, passage, exposure to veto, and so on."39 Legislative outcomes necessarily hinge on arbi- trary (or at least nonsubstantive) factors such as the sequence in which alternatives are presented.40 And no issue is considered in only available evidence would be "the external utterances or behavior of [hundreds of legislators], and in almost every case the only external act is the extremely ambiguous one of acquiescence, which may be motivated in literally hundreds of ways."

In other writing, I have evaluated in detail the merits and demer- its of textualist reliance on public choice theory.44 For present pur- poses, the important point is this: While the textualists' view of the legislative process requires them to reject the classical intentional- ists' anthropomorphic treatment of the legislature, it by no means necessitates a wholesale rejection of any useful conception of legis- lative intent. To satisfy the requirements of legislative supremacy, one need not believe, as classical intentionalists do, that a multi- member legislature has a human-like capacity to form single- minded but unexpressed intentions about the words used in a stat- ute. Rather, as Professor Raz has explained, the demands of legis- lative supremacy require only that legislators intend to enact a law that will be decoded according to prevailing interpretive conven- 41 See Manning, supra note 22, at 2408-19. 42 See Easterbrook, Statutes' Domains, supra note 8, at 548. 43 Id. at 547-48; see also id. at 547 ("Because legislatures comprise many members, they do not have 'intents' or 'designs,' hidden yet discoverable.

If so, then society can at least attribute to each legislator the intention "to say what one would ordinarily be understood as say- ing, given the circumstances in which one said it."45 Or as the lead- ing philosophical textualist, Jeremy Waldron, has put it: A legislator who votes for (or against) a provision like "No vehi- cle shall be permitted to enter any state or municipal park" does so on the assumption that-to put it crudely-what the words mean to him is identical to what they will mean to those to whom they are addressed (in the event that the provision is passed) .... That such assumptions pervade the legislative process shows how much law depends on language, on the shared conventions that constitute a language, and on the reciprocity of intentions that conventions comprise.46 These premises closely reflect Justice Scalia's and Judge Easter- brook's commitment to "objectified intent," a concept predicated on the notion that a judge should read a statutory text just as any reasonable person conversant with applicable social conventions would read it. Ascribing that sort of objectified intent to legislators offers an intelligible way for textualists to hold them accountable for whatever law they have passed, whether or not they have any actual intent, singly or collectively, respecting its details. In that sense, textualism might be understood as a judgment about the most reliable (or perhaps the least unreliable) way of discerning legislative instructions. 4 If one cannot accurately ascer- tain what the body as a whole would have done with matters un- specified or even misspecified by the text, then perhaps the best one can do is to approximate the way a reasonable person in the legislator's position would have read the words actually adopted. Certainly, the aspiration to decode the legislature's instructions as accurately as possible gives textualists something in common with classical intentionalists.48 To say that textualism is just intentional- 45 Raz, supra note 24, at 269. 46 Jeremy Waldron, Legislators' Intention and Unintentional Legislation, in Law and Interpretation 329, 340 (Andrei Marmor ed., 1995). 47 See Nelson, supra note 12, at 353-54. 48 As Professor Nelson notes, this impression of modern textualists is reinforced, al- beit on the margins, by their willingness to depart from the clear import of the en- acted text when the conventional reading reflects an apparent absurdity or scrivener's error.

Wolas, 502</page><page sequence="16">434 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 ism by other means, however, threatens to obscure the central point that for textualists intent is a construct; it does not depend on the conclusion that a hypothetical legislative majority actually sub- scribed to the likely meaning that a reasonable person, conversant with the relevant conventions, would attach to the enacted text. Legislative intent, to the extent textualists invoke it, is a framework of analysis designed to satisfy the minimum conditions for mean- ingful communication by a multi-member body without actual in- tentions to judges, administrators, and the public, who all form a community of shared conventions for decoding language in con- text. To underscore the constructive nature of objectified intent, it is helpful to note that modern textualists are not literalists; they do not look exclusively for the "ordinary meaning" of words and phrases. Rather, they emphasize the relevant linguistic commu- nity's (or sub-community's) shared understandings and practices.49 I have explored the implications of this position more fully in pre- vious writing.50 For now, it suffices to note that textualists therefore want to know how "a skilled, objectively reasonable user of words" would have understood the statutory text,"' an approach that en- tails ascertaining the "assumptions shared by speakers and the in- tended audience."52 Accordingly, where appropriate in context, tex- tualists seek out technical meaning, including the specialized U.S. 151, 163 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) ("Since there was here no contention of a 'scrivener's error' producing an absurd result, the plain text of the statute should have made this litigation unnecessary and unmaintainable."); Kerr v.

See Caleb Nelson, A Response to Professor Manning, 91 Va. L. Rev. 451, 455-57 (2005). This contention, I believe, ultimately proves too much. As I have argued in detail in previous writing, modern textualism ultimately rests on several normative premises derived from the constitu- tional structure. See, e.g., Manning, supra note 22, at 2434-54 (relying on the constitu- tional separation of lawmaking from judging, the requirements of bicameralism and presentment, and the premises of modern rationality review to question the judicial practice of making exceptions to otherwise unqualified statutory texts); Manning, su- pra note 5, at 706-31 (explaining the textualist antipathy towards legislative history as a function of the constitutional norm against legislative self-delegation of lawmaking authority). Prominent among these structural norms is this: By adopting an effective supermajority requirement, the legislative process of bicameralism and presentment affords political minorities extraordinary authority to block legislation or to insist upon compromise as the price of assent. See Manning, supra note 22, at 2437-38; Manning, supra note 7, at 70-78. At least in the strong form that federal judges prac- ticed prior to the advent of modern textualism, purposivism threatened the integrity of any resulting legislative compromise by enforcing the spirit over the letter of the law-that is, the statute's apparent background purpose rather than the precise de- tails bargained for in the adopted text. See Manning, supra note 7, at 77-78; see also id. at 10-15 (describing the strongly purposivist assumptions challenged by modern textualists). If one accepts that analytical framework, textualists appropriately re- jected purposivism on normative grounds, even if purposivism did constitute a previ- ously established mode of interpretation. To suggest otherwise would be to say that textualists must treat as part of every specific compromise a convention that directs courts to ignore the precise terms of that compromise whenever there is good reason to do so. Only facetiously could one say that embracing such a convention satisfies the modern textualists' perceived constitutional duty to protect the specific compromises forged in the legislative process of bicameralism and presentment. As I previously ar- gued along similar lines: If the Court applied a background convention providing that "judges shall ap- ply the social meaning of a statute unless they can think of a better way of doing the same thing," that convention would in some sense be the basis of every leg- islative bargain. But more accurately understood, it would license the courts to disregard the specific bargains struck through the legislative process and to strike new balances outside the confines of bicameralism and presentment.

Along these lines, consider Judge Posner's (otherwise) devastat- ing critique of some of the technical canons of construction commonly deployed within the legal community. See Posner, supra note 32, at 805-17. In particular, he contends that most canons go wrong "because they impute omniscience to Congress," which "is always an unrealistic assumption, and particularly so when one is dealing with the legislative process." Id. at 811. Judge Posner cites, for example, "the canon that every word of a statute must be given significance; nothing in the statute can be treated as surplusage." Id. at 812. This norm, he argues, contradicts the realities of legislative drafting. Similarly, he notes that the "popular canon" disfavoring implied repeals of earlier legislation rests on the apparent presumption that "whenever Con- gress enacts a new statute it combs the United States Code for potential inconsisten- cies with the new statute, and when it spots one, it repeals the inconsistency explic- itly." Id. As he notes, this conception is highly unrealistic. See id. Such canons, however, are intelligible under a textualist theory of objectified intent. As Judge Easterbrook puts it, canons of construction make sense "as off-the-rack rules that spare legislators the costs of anticipating all possible interpretive problems and legis- lating solutions for them." Easterbrook, Statutes' Domains, supra note 8, at 540.

The Court deferred to the Secretary of the Interior's interpretation that habitat modifica- tion fell within the Act's reach, noting that the ESA broadly de- fined "take" to mean "harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect"60-at least some of which could surely encompass the indirect effects of habitat modification. In dissent, Justice Scalia argued that "take" is "a term of art" in wildlife law and, as such, "describes a class of acts (not omissions) done directly and intentionally (not indirectly and by accident) to particular animals (not populations of animals)."6' Although ac- knowledging that the Act's definition section broadly defined "take," the dissent emphasized that nothing in the definition pre- cluded the Court from reading the enumerated list of prohibited acts in light of the common law tradition equating a "taking" with direct rather than indirect acts.62 Of interest here, he identified that tradition not only by locating the technical meaning of "take" in standard dictionaries, but also by examining sources as unobvious (to the ordinary reader) as a nineteenth-century Supreme Court decision, Blackstone's Commentaries, a statute implementing a mi- gratory bird treaty, and a treaty governing polar bear conserva- tion.63 His opinion appears to capture the technical meaning quite 58 515 U.S. 687 (1995). 5916 U.S.C. ? 1538(a)(1) (1994) (emphasis added). 60Id. ? 1532(19). 61 Babbit, 515 U.S. at 718.

In the unlikely event that any meaningful proportion of legislators had any actual intent about what "take" means, I doubt that many in fact knew of nor assented to the specialized legal meaning reflected in the sources cited by Justice Scalia. So while textualists do care about "legislative intent" in the re- fined sense described by Professor Raz, to suggest that they are classical intentionalists by other means obscures the fact that tex- tualists reject perhaps the most important premise of classical in- tentionalism: the idea that behind most legislation lies some sort of policy judgment that is meaningfully identifiable, shared by a legis- lative majority, and yet imprecisely expressed in the public mean- ing of the text that has made its way through Congress's many fil- ters. Textualists focus on the end product of the legislative process, as reflected in the way a reasonable person conversant with appli- cable conventions would read the enacted words in context.64 Be- cause of the fractured, tortuous, and often concealed nature of leg- islative bargaining, textualists believe that such a construct is the best that interpreters can do-that objectified intent provides the most, if not the only, plausible way for a faithful agent to show fi- delity to his principal.

II. LEGISLATIVE BARGAINS AND LEVELS OF STATUTORY GENERALITY A central precept of textualism is that interpreters must respect the level of generality at which the text expresses legislative policy judgments-that is, that judges should treat rules as rules and stan- dards as standards. Specifically, although textualists find it appro- priate in cases of ambiguity to consult a statute's apparent purpose or policy (provided that it is derived from sources other than legis- lative history),65 they resist altering a statute's clear semantic im- 65 See, e.g., Nat'l Tax Credit Partners v. Havlik, 20 F.3d 705, 707 (7th Cir. 1994) (Easterbrook, J.) ("Knowing the purpose behind a rule may help a court decode an ambiguous text, but first there must be some ambiguity." (citations omitted)); An- tonin Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 515 ("Surely one of the most frequent justifications courts give for choosing a particular construction is that the alternative interpretation would produce 'absurd' results, or results less compatible with the reason or purpose of the statute."). Profes- sor Nelson understandably regards such reliance on apparent purpose in cases of am- biguity as evidence that textualism does indeed have roots in classical intentionalism. See Nelson, supra note 12, at 354-56. While plausible, that conclusion does not neces- sarily follow from the textualists' practice. First, purpose need not reflect the subjec- tive understandings of legislators found in the legislative history; rather, textualists frequently infer legislative purpose from such sources as the overall tenor or structure of a statute. See, e.g., City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., Inc., 536 U.S. 424, 450 (2002) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (noting that "[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose is sought in the text and structure of the statute at issue" (alteration in origi- nal) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993)); Pa. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (Scalia, J.) ("[T]he title of a statute ... [is] of use only when [it] shed[s] light on some ambiguous word or phrase." (first, third, and fourth alterations in original) (in- ternal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Balt. &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-29 (1947)); United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 449 (1988) (Scalia, J.) (holding that the nonreviewability of adverse personnel actions un- der the Civil Service Reform Act derives "not only from the statutory language, but also from... the structure of the statutory scheme"). Second, textualists may rely on apparent overall purpose not as a way of identifying subjective legislative intent, but rather as a theory of appropriate judicial behavior in cases of indeterminacy. Justice Scalia has thus written: "Where a statutory term presented to us for the first time is ambiguous, we construe it to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logi- cally and comfortably into the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law." W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 100 (1991); see also Fausto, 484 U.S. at 453 (describing the "classic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to 'make sense' in combination").

No matter how precisely framed, laws will sometimes be over- or under-inclusive in relation to their apparent back- ground aims.67 When a sufficiently dramatic mismatch between means and ends occurs (or, more accurately, appears to occur), classical intentionalists ascribe that divergence to legislative inad- vertence.68 Classical intentionalists think it possible for judges to identify the collective policy judgment that the legislative majority would have arrived at had it framed the statute to avoid impreci- sion in the chosen words. Hence, they are willing to adjust the level tionalists, textualists resolve ambiguity in that way "not because that precise accommodative meaning is what the lawmakers must have had in mind... , but because it is [the judiciary's] role to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris." Casey, 499 U.S. at 100-01. For a contrasting statement that more strongly supports Professor Nelson's view, see Easterbrook, supra note 52, at 443 ("Because laws themselves do not have purposes or spirits-only the authors are sentient-it may be essential to mine the context of the utterance out of the debates, just as we learn the limits of a holding from reading the entire opinion."). Full exploration of the precise basis for textualists' reliance on apparent background pur- pose in cases of ambiguity is a matter for another day. 66 See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 723 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Our obligation is to go as far in achieving the general congressional purpose as the text of the statute fairly prescribes-and no further."); Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 262 (1993) (Scalia, J.)

Rose, 481 U.S. 619, 644 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (criticizing the Court for assuming "a broad power to limit clear text on the basis of apparent congressional purpose"). 67 See Bernard W.

Ct. Rev. 231, 236 ("Where decisionmakers are instructed in accordance with... specific directives, these direc- tives are necessarily actually or potentially both under- and over-inclusive vis-a-vis their background justifications."). 68 As Judge Posner has thus written: [J]udges realize in their heart of hearts that the superficial clarity to which they are referring when they call the meaning of a statute "plain" is treacherous footing for interpretation. They know that statutes are purposive utterances and that language is a slippery medium in which to encode a purpose. They know that legislatures, including the Congress of the United States, often legislate in haste, without considering fully the potential application of their words to novel settings. Friedrich v.

They believe that smoothing over the rough edges in a stat- ute threatens to upset whatever complicated bargaining led to its being cast in the terms that it was.70 Hence, for textualists, respect- ing the level of generality preserves the carefully designed process in which varied gatekeepers may block or slow legislation or exact a compromise as the price of assent. West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey7 supplies perhaps the clearest example of this line of demarcation.

Under modern textualism, of course, one could not say that the matter begins and ends with the conclusion that an "expert fee" is literally not an "attorney's fee." At least one would need to consider whether the phrase "attorney's fee" is a term of the trade that includes more than a lawyer's billable hours. As used in the legal profession, that term might in fact encompass many items essential to a representation-such as paralegal ser- vices, secretarial services, messengers, photocopying, Westlaw charges, and so forth.72 Hence, the operative phrase has an underly- ing ambiguity that must be resolved by considering the phrase in context. Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Casey found the seman- tic context decisive, crediting evidence of the way a reasonable per- son would have used the relevant language in context. His opinion emphasized the fact that countless other fee-shifting statutes- some enacted before and some after ? 1988-had explicitly pro- vided for "attorney's fees" and "expert fees" as separate items of recovery.7 Under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, "it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and pur- posely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion" of particular statu- tory language.74 Accordingly, the Court held that the relevant "statutory usage shows beyond question that attorney's fees and expert fees are distinct items of expense."75 Although acknowledg- ing that the resulting emphasis on usage made the policy of ? 1988 incongruent with that of similar fee-shifting statutes, the Court ex- plained that interpreting a statute to promote policy coherence was a permissible judicial function where "a statutory term... is ambiguous."76 Where consideration of the semantic context points clearly to a particular meaning, the Court stressed that "it is not our function to eliminate clearly expressed inconsistency of policy and to treat alike subjects that different Congresses have chosen to 72 See Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285-86 (1989) (holding that various items other than billable attorney hours, including paralegal fees, could be recovered as "traditional" elements of an attorney's fees).

For the classical intentionalist, however, a clear pattern of usage would not end the matter; it would still remain necessary to meas- ure the phrase "attorney's fee" against the policy impulses that ap- parently underlay the majority's enactment of the specific legisla- tion. In his dissenting opinion in Casey, Justice Stevens thus criticized the Court for "put[ting] on its thick grammarian's specta- cles and ignor[ing] the available evidence of congressional purpose and the teaching of prior cases."'" In particular, he reasoned that if a prevailing plaintiff could recover a reasonable "attorney's fee," it made no sense to deny the plaintiff similar recovery for an expert, whose services merely provided a lower cost substitute for attorney time.79 Moreover, because the Court had previously recognized that a prevailing plaintiff could recover paralegal fees and other costs of representation under ? 1988, it would surely appear arbitrary not to allow the recovery of expert fees needed to make the legal repre- sentation effective.80 In addition, no one disputed that Congress enacted ? 1988 to overturn the Court's decision in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,"8 which had rejected the federal courts' common law practice of shifting litigation costs in certain federal cases. Because the pre-Alyeska regime had shifted attor- ney's fees and expert fees, Justice Stevens thought it fair to infer that ? 1988's purpose was to restore the status quo ante.82 Finally, although the dissent did not mention the point, because Congress had provided for the recovery of expert fees in virtually every other important fee-shifting statute, one might think it arbitrary to 77 Id. at 101. 78 Id. at 113 (Stevens, J., dissenting). 79 Id. at 106-07 (Stevens, J., dissenting) 80 See id. at 107-08 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("To allow reimbursement of these other categories of expenses, and yet not to include expert witness fees, is both arbitrary and contrary to the broad remedial purpose that inspired the fee-shifting provision of ? 1988."). 8 421 U.S. 240 (1975). 82 Casey, 499 U.S. at 108-11 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Put differently, they believe 83 See T. Alexander Aleinikoff &amp; Theodore M. Shaw, The Costs of Incoherence: A Comment on Plain Meaning, West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, and Due Process of Statutory Interpretation, 45 Vand. L. Rev. 687, 704-05 (1992). 84 Although somewhat tangential to the present comparison of modern textualism and classical intentionalism, it is worth noting that the textualists' preference for a statute's letter over its spirit does not hinge on the distinction between objective and subjective intent. Rather, the legislative process concerns that inform textualism cut more deeply. In this regard, it is helpful to contrast textualism with another post- realist response to classical intentionalism-the Legal Process school founded by Henry Hart and Albert Sacks at Harvard Law School. See Henry M. Hart, Jr. &amp; Al- bert M. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1378-79 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. &amp; Philip P. Frickey eds., 1994); see also Wil- liam N. Eskridge, Jr. &amp; Philip P. Frickey, The Making of The Legal Process, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 2031 (1994) (discussing the strong post-war influence of the Legal Process ma- terials). Much like modern textualists, Hart and Sacks subscribed to the faithful agent theory while simultaneously rejecting the idea that "the court's function is to ascertain the intention of the legislature with respect to the matter in issue." Hart &amp; Sacks, su- pra, at 1374; see also id. (acknowledging that interpreters in our system must "[r]espect the position of the legislature as the chief policy-determining agency of the society, subject only to the limitations of the constitution"). Also like modern textual- ists, Hart and Sacks proposed an objective rather than subjective standard for reading the work product of the legislature. In particular, after considering a variety of inter- pretive resources (including the statutory text, canons of interpretation, and the gen- eral purposes revealed by any relevant legislative history), interpreters were to ask how "reasonable persons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably" would have solved the problem addressed by the statute. Id. at 1378. Even if one could not know the subjective intent of the multi-member legislature that enacted the law, one could attempt to ascribe to the legislature the policy preferences that a reasonable person would hold in the surrounding circumstances. This approach, of course, attempts to erect an objective construct no less than does the textualists' strategy of asking how a "reasonable user of words" would have read the statute as applied to the problem at hand. Easterbrook, supra note 9, at 65. And, in contrast with textualism, the Legal Process school's focus on the "reasonable policymaker" attractively presupposes that an interpreter can respect the background constitutional precept of legislative su- premacy while also making statutory law more coherent and rational. As Professor Radin explained in an influential article that helped frame the Legal Process ap- proach, "[t]o say that the legislature is 'presumed' to have selected its phraseology with meticulous care as to every word is in direct contradiction of known facts and in- jects an improper element into the relation of courts to the statutes."

Rev. 388, 406 (1942).</page><page sequence="27">2005] Textualism and Legislative Intent 445 that the reasonable reader standard supplies the best, and indeed the only meaningful, way to take seriously a legislative process that has many twists and turns; that gives the most intensely interested or even outlying legislative actors many opportunities to stop, slow, or reshape initiatives that have apparent majority support; and that emphasizes the legislative majority's need to compromise as a way to secure a bill's passage. The results of such a process are likely to look awkward for reasons having nothing to do with failures of human foresight or lapses in drafting skill. Accordingly, for textual- ists, any attempt to overlay coherence on a statutory text that oth- erwise seems to have problems of fit unacceptably threatens to un- dermine the bargaining process that produced it. A recent case sharply illustrates this more affirmative version of the legislative process justification for textualism. In Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,"85 the Court enforced the rules embedded in a clear statutory text even though it required an outcome that a rea- sonable person would assuredly find absurd in light of the statute's underlying purpose. To address the potential insolvency of coal in- dustry retirement plans imposed by a series of collective bargaining agreements, Congress enacted the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.86 The Act imposed contribution requirements on two classes of businesses: first, on "signatory operators"-coal operators who had signed any of the previous pension agreements; and second, on "related persons"-companies that had enjoyed As I have explained in greater detail in prior writing, modern textualists believe that relying on the "reasonable policymaker" construct to impose statutory coherence undervalues the importance of respecting often-unprincipled compromises that emerge in the text from a chaotic and opaque legislative process. See Manning, supra note 22, at 2390. This conviction, as I have argued, has roots in the constitutional structure. See id. at 2434-54. By imposing an effective supermajority requirement for the enactment of legislation, the constitutionally mandated legislative process of bi- cameralism and presentment gives political minorities extraordinary power to block legislation or, more importantly, to insist upon compromise as the price of assent. See id. at 2437-38. This tendency, moreover, is reinforced by the previously discussed procedural hurdles inherent in existing legislative practice. See supra text accompany- ing notes 38-42. At least when a statute is otherwise clear in context, textualists be- lieve that imposing coherent policy at the expense of semantic detail threatens to di- lute the minority's constitutionally ordained prerogative to compel the majority to accept half a loaf. 85 534 U.S. 438 (2002). 86 26 U.S.C. ?? 9701-9722 (2000).</page><page sequence="28">446 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 specified forms of business affiliation with signatory operators." In Barnhart, the Commissioner of Social Security had imposed liabil- ity on the respondent coal company, which was neither a signatory operator nor a related person but was a successor in interest to a signatory operator (by virtue of having bought a signatory's mining assets). Although the Act explicitly imposed liability on successors in interest to related persons, it made no such provision for succes- sors in interest to the signatory operators themselves." Applying settled principles of statutory construction,89 the Court reasoned that "[w]here Congress wanted to provide successor liability in the ... Act, it did so explicitly."" Hence, a successor in interest to a signatory operator was not liable for retiree's pensions under the Act. The Commissioner of Social Security, the official charged with administering the Act, argued that such an interpretation produced absurd results. Specifically, the Court's reading relieved a direct successor of any responsibility for a signatory's beneficiaries, while imposing such responsibility on "a more distantly related successor in interest of a corporate affiliate of a signatory operator."91 In- deed, if a signatory coal operator had been affiliated with a dairy (such that the dairy was a "related person"), and if each company then sold its assets to different buyers, the Act would assign finan- 87 Id. ? 9701(c)(2) (2000). In particular, the statute provides that "a person shall be considered to be a related person to a signatory operator if that person" falls within one of following categories: (i) a member of the controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 52(a)) which includes such signatory operator; (ii) a trade or business which is under common control (as determined under section 52(b)) with such signatory operator; or (iii) any other person who is identified as having a partnership interest or joint venture with a signatory operator in a business within the coal industry, but only if such business employed eligible beneficiaries, except that this clause shall not apply to a person whose only interest is as a limited partner. Id. 88 See id. ? 9701(c)(2)(A) (2000) ("A related person shall also include a successor in interest to any person described in [the 'related persons' definition] in clause (i), (ii), or (iii)."). 89 See supra note 74 and accompanying text. 90 Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 452-53. 9 Id. at 459.</page><page sequence="29">2005] Textualism and Legislative Intent 447 cial responsibility for the signatory's retirees to the dairy's succes- sor, but not to the signatory's successor.92 Although it did not deny the oddity of the result, the Court did not try to justify the statutory distinction in terms of any public pol- icy related to the Act. Instead, the Court relied directly upon the procedural considerations that might have produced the outcome in question: [N]egotiations surrounding enactment of this bill tell a typical story of legislative battle among interest groups, Congress, and the President. Indeed, this legislation failed to ease tensions among many of the interested parties. Its delicate crafting re- flected a compromise amidst highly interested parties attempting to pull the provisions in different directions. As such, a change in any individual provision could have unraveled the whole. It is quite possible that a bill that assigned liability to successors of signatory operators would not have survived the legislative proc- ess. The deals brokered during a Committee markup, on the floor of the two Houses, during a joint House and Senate Con- ference, or in negotiations with the President are not for us to judge or second-guess.93 Hence, the Court found it imperative to respect the actual outcome of the legislative process, at least where the text was unambigu- ous.94 Again, in a sense it is fair to say that this affirmative justification for textualism belongs within some understanding of the intention- alist tradition, for it rests upon the notion that enforcing the clear semantic meaning of a statute represents the best, if not the only, way to preserve the unknowable legislative bargains that produced the final text. Indeed, textualism arguably aspires to implement a heightened form of the very impulse that underlies intentionalism; that is, it seeks to ensure that the only policy judgments attributed to the body as a whole are those reflected in (the reasonable im- port of) the one and only text that survived the many and intricate 92 Id. at 465 (Stevens, J., dissenting). 93 Id. at 461 (citations and footnote omitted). 94 Id.

Modern textualists believe that a search for such knowable and identifiable legislative intention is an empty one except insofar as it has been filtered through the complicated process prescribed for agreeing upon that text.96 95 Although extended treatment of the question is beyond the scope of the present inquiry, it is useful at the close of this Essay to note that a similar premise may under- lie the textualists' well-known aversion to assigning legislative history decisive weight, even in cases of textual ambiguity. Their reluctance to credit the expressions of mean- ing found in committee reports and sponsor statements rests upon the articulated premise that such expressions have not cleared the high hurdles for enactment pre- scribed by the Constitution and the rules of each chamber; therefore, they cannot ac- curately reflect the bargain that could actually be struck in the legislative process. As Judge Easterbrook has explained: The concern "is political rather than epistemological or hermeneutic. [Textual- ists] are worried that the gauntlet that the Constitution requires bills to run be- fore they become law will be bypassed if judges give heed not just to the enact- ment itself but to what individual members of Congress said about it, perhaps in a deliberate effort to influence judicial interpretation." Herrmann v. Cencom Cable Assocs., 978 F.2d 978, 982 (7th Cir. 1992) (quoting Cent. States Pension Fund v. Lady Balt. Foods, Inc., 960 F.2d 1339, 1346 (7th Cir. 1992)); see also Easterbrook, supra note 9, at 64 ("If we took an opinion poll of Congress to- day on a raft of issues and found out its views, would those views become the law? Certainly not. They must run the gamut of the process-and process is the essence of legislation."); Easterbrook, supra note 52, at 445 ("What distinguishes laws from the results of opinion polls conducted among legislators is that the laws survived a diffi- cult set of procedural hurdles and either passed by a two-thirds vote or obtained the President's signature."). 96 Professor Nelson detects "some internal tension" in my contentions (a) that tex- tualists doubt that Congress has unexpressed but meaningful intentions on any seri- ously contested interpretive question, and (b) that textualists adhere closely to the level of generality at which Congress frames its directives because doing so preserves whatever unknowable bargains underlay the enactment. See Nelson, supra note 53, at 452-53. The perceived tension, however, rests on the apparent assumption that Con- gress can strike a bargain only if the legislative majority is somehow subjectively aware of and consciously accepts its contents. That premise is dictated neither by logi- cal necessity nor by the practical reality of the legislative process. Rather, modern tex- tualists maintain that legislation is the end product of a series of complex bargains- bargains that frequently occur behind the scenes and that shape statutory language in untraceable ways. See Manning, supra note 22, at 2409-17 (discussing the legislative process assumptions underlying modern textualism). The procedures governing legis-</page><page sequence="31">2005] Textualism and Legislative Intent 449 lation-those imposed by the bicameralism and presentment requirements of Article I, ? 7, as well as those prescribed by legislatively adopted rules of self-governance- place numerous and elaborately designed hurdles in the path of legislation. Certainly, textualists do not doubt that sentient actors at the various gatekeeper points in the legislative process often make conscious wording (and thus policy) choices- frequently unrecorded compromises needed to clear the high procedural hurdles. Ul- timately, the legislature as a whole votes up or down on whatever text has succeeded in clearing all of the necessary obstacles-including making it through committee, se- curing time on the floor, undergoing amendment, surviving a potential or actual fili- buster, coming out of conference, and accounting for the possibility of a presidential veto. See, e.g., Easterbrook, supra note 9, at 64 (discussing the effect of procedural obstacles to legislation); Kenneth A. Shepsle &amp; Barry R. Weingast, The Institutional Foundations of Committee Power, 81 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 85, 89 (1987) (same). In or- der to yield a meaningful compromise that a normatively attractive version of textual- ism might wish to preserve, the legislative majority need have only the intention, in voting, to accept whatever textual bargains the relevant actors managed to strike us- ing the procedures specified for crafting legislation. The legislative majority does not need a further subjective understanding and intention to accept each detail of the un- derlying bargains. I should note further that the foregoing conclusion does not (as Professor Nelson could at times be taken to suggest) compel textualists to conclude that the legislature votes with utter ignorance of the contents of legislation. Contrasting my account of textualism, Professor Nelson thus writes that "it is surely desirable for there to be some connection between what members of the enacting Congress understood them- selves to be doing and what judges take them to have done." Nelson, supra note 53, at 454. He adds that many legislators do more than "simply voting for the words of a bill (whatever they may be) with the intention that words will be interpreted according to prevailing conventions (whatever they may be)." Id. at 457. Although it is beyond this Essay's scope to address the essentially empirical question of what legislators actually know when they vote for or against a bill, I can readily accept arguendo that the legis- lative majority may indeed have a shared sense of a bill's broad policy goals. (Indeed, that assumption may explain the textualists' willingness to rely on apparent purpose in cases of ambiguity. See supra note 65.) It is even possible to accept, for argument's sake, that some legislators will sometimes attempt to master the wording of at least some important provisions of a statute. To focus on those possibilities in a strong way, however, understates the intent skepticism that lies at the root of modern textualism. If one examines the many technical provisions of a federal statute of ordinary com- plexity (much less those of the Social Security Act or the Tax Code), it becomes diffi- cult to assume that the "legislative majority" reliably shares a subjective policy inten- tion or understanding about questions of detailed application, particularly in the hard cases that trouble statutory interpreters. At that level, Professor Radin was surely jus- tified in doubting the possibility that "a given determinate, the litigated issue, will not only be within the minds of all [the legislators] but will be certain to be selected by all of them as the present limit to which the [statutory] determinable should be nar- rowed." Radin, supra note 34, at 870. And if Professor Radin's intuition is correct (as textualists believe), then knowing the shared sense of what Congress was "driving at" may do little real work, at least when the relevant textual details are otherwise clear in context. The process of legislative bargaining that produces a final text will invaria- bly impose qualifications upon the majority's shared sense of general purpose. The</page><page sequence="32">450 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 91:419 CONCLUSION For many years, the Supreme Court practiced a form of inten- tionalism that presupposed that judges could meaningfully identify policy judgments that Congress "intended" but had not adequately expressed. Under that assumption, the Court felt free to supple- ment vague statutory expressions with the contents of internal leg- islative history and, more importantly, to correct the inevitable problems of statutory fit without perceiving itself to have violated the constitutional premises of legislative supremacy. The assump- tions that modern textualists bring to understanding the legislative process make those practices harder to sustain. The legislative process is untidy and opaque; it gives those with intense and even outlying preferences numerous opportunities to slow or stop legis- lation and to insist upon compromise as the price of assent. The precise wording of any given statute may have been, for unknow- able reasons, essential to its passage. Thus, efforts to augment or vary the text in the name of serving a genuine but unexpressed leg- islative intent risks displacing whatever bargain was actually reached through the complex and path-dependent legislative proc- ess. That set of legislative process assumptions not only defines modern textualism, but also makes it qualitatively different from the classical intentionalist tradition that has long dominated the Court's approach to statutes. precise import of the textual details need not be in the minds of the majority in order for the resulting refinements to be accepted as a necessary part of the bargains that produced the legislation. At that level, as noted, the only collective intention neces- sary-and plausibly recoverable-is the intention to adopt a bargained-for text that will be construed according to accepted social and linguistic conventions.
