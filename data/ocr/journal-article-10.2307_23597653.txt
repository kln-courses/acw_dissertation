<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES THE CANAANITE CITY—STATES IN THE LATE BRONZE AGE AND THE INHERITANCES OF THE ISRAELITE TRIBES by Nadav Ναάμαν The article discusses the relationship between the system of the Canaanite city-states in the Late Bronze Age and the biblical tribal borders. The network of the Canaanite kingdoms is first outlined, with emphasis on the fact that it was composed of kingdoms of higher and lesser rank. Many of the smaller city-states were influenced and sometimes even dominated by their stronger neighbours. The Golan heights, Upper and Lower Galilee, parts of the Judaean and Samarian hill country and the Negev were barely inhabited in the Late Bronze Age, and thus may be regarded to a certain extent as a kind of 'no man's land'. A careful delineation of the borders of several large Canaanite kingdoms indicates their similarity to biblical tribal allotments. The following congruences are suggested: Hazor and Naphtali; Shim'on and Zebulun; Anaharath and Issachar; Megiddo, Taanach, Ibleam and Beth-Shean and the Canaanite enclaves in the Jezreel and Beth-Shean valleys (Josh. 17, 10-11; Judg. 1, 27); Gezer and Dan; Shechem and the 'nuclear' inheritances of Manasseh and Ephraim; Jerusalem and Benjamin. Numerous small Canaanite city-states became border towns within the tribal boundaries (Beth-Shemesh [of Naphtali], Marom/Maron, Helkath, Jokneam, Bethel, Beth-Shemesh [of Judah]). An explanation is offered in the last part of the article for the territorial congruence between so many Late Bronze Age kingdoms and biblical tribal allotments or parts of them, which were delineated and registered only in the 10th century B.C. THE CRITICAL EDITION OF MEK1LTA DE—RABBI ISHMAEL IN THE LIGHT OF THE GENIZAH FRAGMENTS by Menahem Kahana Approximately fifty years ago, two critical editions of the Mekilta De-Rabbi Ishmael on Exodus were published; the first by H.S. Horovitz and I.A. Rabin (Frankfurt 1930), and the second by J.Z. Lauterbach (Philadelphia 1933-5). These editions were reviewed by E.Z. Melamed (Hor. ed.), and S. Lieberman (Laut. ed.). In general Lieberman and Melamed praised the works, while presenting the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods used by the editors in choosing the base text, and in registering the textual variants. Since the publication of these editions, philological-historical methods in investigating the Talmudic literature have progressed. At the same time, new manuscripts of the Mekilta were</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES discovered, which include many Genizah fragments. Contrary to the complete western witnesses, which Horovitz and Lauterbach exploited, the Genizah documents reflect an Oriental tradition. Frequently the original version of the Mekilta was presented only in this tradition. In this article I would like with the aid of three examples, to emphasize the need for a new critical edition of the Mekilta De-Rabbi Ishmael. The first example deals with a difficult connection between two homiletic interpretations, which becomes clear in the Genizah version, where the sign of an ancient division is found. This sign was misunderstood and therefore was amended in all the European manuscripts. The subject of the other examples is two vague controversies between R' Akiva and R' Papys, that I attempt to explain in the light of the Genizah texts and the influence of the Gnostic movement. In the appendices I criticize B.Z. Wacholder's view on the dating of the Mekilta and explain an additional interpretation of R' Akiva, which is based on his opposition to Gnostic commentaries. THE DECREES OF KARTIR AGAINST THE JEWS OF BABYLONIA by Moshe Beer The author questions whether a reference to the decrees of Kartir against the non-Mazdean religions in Persia during the reign of Bahram II (274-293 C.E.) was preserved in rabbinic literature. The answer, at present, is that no direct reference is made. However, the author claims that several remarks of R. Joseph indicate an atmoshpere of gloom. R. Joseph was a scholar of Pumbedita during the reign of Kartir. R. Joseph's remarks indicate a deep hatred for the Persians. Perhaps the sense of oppression revealed in his remarks and his attitude to the Persians are the consequence of the decrees enacted against the Jews of Babylonia and their religion. We hear of the upsurge of Messianic thought at that time, which in R. Joseph's thought was expressed as strong yearning. It is possible that this upsurge as well was the result of the religious oppression suffered by the Jews of Babylonia under the decrees of Kartir. A GERMAN JEWISH AUTOBIOGRAPHY FROM THE 14TH CENTURY by Israel J. Yuval The beginning of the genre of the factual autobiography in Jewish literature cannot be dated earlier than the 16th century. While as early as the middle ages various authors included in their works various autobiographical notes, these were incidental and lacked the broad retrospective scope of an entire life story. Medieval Jewish and Christian autobiographies are similar in their rarity and their typology. In light of these facts, special notice should be given to an autobiography, written in the late 14th century by an anonymous Jew, born in Duren, Germany, and a resident of Andernach at the time of its composition. Its uniqueness is threefold:</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES III 1. This document is the first of its kind in Jewish literature in its orderly and chronologically description of one man's life. 2. It is a personal autobiography, in which, despite the dry prosaic style, the author illuminates with warmth and sincerity authentic and intimate events in his life. 3. The author was not a well-known figure, but an ordinary man. The author opens his autobiography in the year 1370, when he left his parental home, at age 13, and went to Mainz to study. From Mainz he returned to his mother's home (his father had died in the interim) and on the way home was captured by robbers, between Bonn and Cologne. The Graf von Berg released him and he returned to Diiren. A year later he joined the army of Duke Wilhelm II of Julich in his battle with Wenzel of Brabant. His mother's anger at this unconventional adventure set him off on his travels again. He reached Koblenz, Rothenburg and Austria, the center of learning for the German Jewry during that period. There he married, far from his mother, and after 5 years returned to his homeland. He continued to wander after his marriage as well: between 1375and 1390 he moved six times, living in Siegburg (twice), Diiren, Andernach (twice), and Koblenz. In the summer of 1378, while living in Siegburg, he was again jailed in consequence of the execution of Simon von Siegburg, a rich Jew of the time. This obscure incident, which is mentioned as well in the chronicle of the city of Cologne and in a lamentation written by R. Menahem Zion — was the cause of the outbreak of war between the city of Cologne and the Archbishop (Schoffenkrieg), where the issue was the sovereignity of the city vis-a-vis the Archbishop. The autobiography illuminates several details of that event. After his release, the author moved to Andernach and started on his third trip for purposes of study, at the age of 21. It was cut short by the deaths of his two sisters, in Andernach and Cologne. Between 1380-1387 he settled in Koblenz and served as cantor, butcher and innkeeper. He left there and resettled in Andernach, where he was jailed for a third time, and was severely wounded by the blows delivered by a local non-Jew. The descriptions of his troubles end with the prayer to be privileged to go to Jerusalem with his family. This life story sheds some interesting light on the social history and daily life of the Jews of Germany, such as demographic instability, journeys for the purpose of study, familial relations, marriage customs, etc. The third chapter of the article deals with these issues. The last chapter considers the literary nature of this document and the self-awarenes of its author in comparision to contemporary German autobiographies, in particular those of Ulman Stromer and Burkard Zink. A copy of the autobiography from the manuscript in the Bodleian library in Oxford, Michael 74 (Neubauer, Cat. No. 1171) is appended to the article. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BELLETRISTIC LITERATURE AND JEWISH WISSENSCHAFT IN THE HASKALAH PERIOD by Samuel Werses The first contact between poetry and scholarship was evident in the earliest stages of the literature of the Hebrew Haskalah in Germany of the latter half of the 18th country, in the literature of N.H. Weisel. The substantive distinctions between Biblical exegesis and poetry appears in the introduction to his Shirei Tiferet. In the works of his cousin, Isaac Satanov, primarily in his</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES epigrammatic work, Mishlei Assaf, is found the tendency to mystification in the fabrication of an ancient text including its exegetical aspects. In constrast, it was customary to use the poetic form to discuss scholarly subjects. The poet Shlomo Lewisohn treats problems in the Hebrew language via dramatic dialogue in his work Shira BeOlam HaNeshamot (1811). A.B. Gottover lectures on the history of Hebrew poetry via poetry. The duplication of poet and scholar is evident in the literary works ofSh. Y. Rappaport andSh. D. Luzatto in the first half of the 19th century. Luzatto even attempted to influence the poetic construction of Letteris and Lewinsohn, both in terms of prosody and theory. The scholar of medieval poetry, Meir Zachs, served as a link between scholars, poets and storytellers; he encouraged their creativity and aided them in distributing their works in scholarly circles. In contrast to the tendency to maintain close contact with representatives of contemporary belletristic literature, there is evidence of isolationist and separatist tendencies among Jewish scholars in Germany in the 19th century. Just, Geiger and Steinschneider's reservations stemmed as well from their doubts as to the ability of the non-spoken Hebrew language to serve as the natural vehicle of expression for contemporary Jewish literature. Y.L. Gordon expressed the position of the creative Hebrew poet in this dispute, revealing as well a leaning towards Biblical scholarship and ancient Jewish history in his notes and introductions to his poetic works. The novelist Abraham Mapu proclaimed the greater utility of the Hebrew novel in disseminating beliefs and opinions about Judaism over scholarly works whose distribution was limited. He even presented in belletristic form certain historiosophic theories of Nachman Krochmal's school of thought. R.A. Broides pointed to the problems of orders of priority faced by the novelist as opposed to the historian in presenting the ideological struggles within Jewish society. Nonetheless he himself used the text of his novel HaDat veHahaim in surveys and claims which were supported by historical findings. In addition to the contentions of Mapu and Broides, strong reservations were voiced by the representatives of the positivist movement in Jewish literary criticism in the 1860's concerning the achievements of Jewish Wissenschaft in the study of the Hebrew language and the Bible. In contrast, we know of the admiration of Peretz Smolenskin, the novelist and editor of the monthly HaShahar, for Jewish scholars and their work in Jewish studies. From his platform he encouraged research projects in Jewish studies, via the various rescensions he made and by prominently publishing the words of scholars. In the post-Haskalah period, the work of H.N. Bialik in attempting to strengthen ties between the two spheres of belles lettres and Jewish scholarship by constant emphasis on the importance of the Hebrew language as the natural and vital language for the publication of the research of Jewish Wissenschaft is outstanding and represents a continuation to the struggle of Gordon and Smolenskin previously. RESPONSE by Bilha Nitzan While one of the songs of 4Q 511 (8,6-11) contains an early hint to the use of Psalm 91, known in the Talmud as ישיר של פגעים' its use in Qumran differs from that of the Psalm. The song from Qumran</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES consists of original verses based on isolated phrases from Psalm 91:1-4 alone, as well as the motif of the angels mentioned in verse 11. The suggestion to read the words of 'he poet-worshipper from Qumran 'לתעות 4) רוח בינה ולהשס לבבם ונ[פשו]תם וכוי'Q 510:1,6) as his action intended to confuse the evil spirits, is untenable. These words describe the damage done by destructive spirits to the Sons of Light. This explanation is offered based on considerations of modes of thought and literary and linguistic style common to Qumran and related literature which deal with defense against destructive spirits. GREEK IN THE TALMUD: AN ALLUSION TO A HELLENISTIC EPIGRAM? by Joseph Geiger In Rabbinic literature the adjectives hardali and gardali describe wine: hardali means 'mustard coloured' (cf. κιρρός), gardali seems to be a pun on the name of the town of Gadara (cf. gardi (or gadri in Abnimos ha-Gardi Oenomaos of Gadara). The passage in B. Sabbath 62b-63a, where these wines allude to women, dark and fair, with whom one has spent the night, may well be influenced by the famous (cf. Philodemus in A.P. 5.115) epigram by Meleager of Gadara (A.P.5.165) about his love for two boys, one dark, the other fair. ON SOUNDING THE SHOFAR IN THE HIGH COURT OF PALESTINE ON SHABBATROSH HASHANAH by Leib Moscovitz A recently published piyyut (Tarbiz 54 [1984], pp. 61-66) describing the procedure for sounding the shofar on Shabbat Rosh Hashanah in the High Court of Palestine records the hitherto unattested practice of tying the shofar to a pillar, to prevent the rAo/ar-blower from touching the instrument with his hands. Prof. E. Fleischer, in his discussion of this unusual practice (ibid.), suggests that it reflects the Babylonian interpretation of the Mishnaic prohibition against sounding the Shofar on Shabbat outside of the Temple ("lest one carry the shofar four cubits in the public domain," B. Rosh Hashanah 29b), and hence attests to the influence of the Babylonian halakhah on tenth-century Palestinian rabbinic authorities. This explanation and the conclusions drawn from it are challenged here, on the grounds that (1) there is evidence suggesting that the so-called "Babylonian" interpretation of the Mishnah was not exclusively Babylonian, and (2) the practice described in the poem need not be explained in light of this supposedly Babylonian halakhah in the first place; rather, it may reflect the stringent Palestinian halakhot of mukzeh attested to by the Talmud Yerushalmi and the Hillukim She-Bein Anshei Mizrah U-Vnei Erez Israel.</page><page sequence="6">VI SUMMARIES REJOINDER by Ezra Fleischer In his short remark to L. Moscowitz's note, the author points out that the procedure of blowing the Shofar on Shabbat as reflected in the piyyut published by him in Tar biz 54, can by no means be considered the original custom prevalent in ancient, Talmudic Erez Israel. There can be no doubt about the fact that the genuine way of blowing the Shofar in the High Court of Palestine was modified in a later period, due to some evidently new halakhic consideration, and that the piyyut represents this secondary, rather late, state of facts. In the author's opinion, the Palestinian view of mukzeh can hardly explain this change, since it should have affected the custom from its beginning. Moreover, the very concept of mukzeh can hardly be applied to any action permitted to be done on Shabbat. Therefore, in the author's opinion, the gezerah of Rabba, which despite Moscowitz's argument is still not proved to have been known in ancient Erez Israel, remains a more plausible explanation of the piyyut's puzzling testimony. BOOK REVIEW: BERNARD SEPTIMUS, HISPANO—JEWISH CULTURE IN TRANSITION: THE CAREER AND CONTROVERSIES OF RAM AH, 1982 by Warren Zev Harvey This is a very fine study of Rabbi Meir Ha-Levi Abulafia (c. 1165 — 1244) and his times. Ramah emerges as an erudite, independent, many-sided scholar. He was a tough critic of radical rationalism, but was neither a radical anti-rationalist nor a Kabbalist. Rather, his religious orientation was true to "a gaonic-Andalusian tradition of conservativism" (p. 108). On some issues (e.g., interpretation of anthropomorphic texts in the Bible and Midrash), he seems to have been closer to Maimonides than to the anti-Maimonideans.</page></plain_text>
