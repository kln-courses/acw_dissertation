<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Early Great Styles and the Rise of the Pre,Columbian Civilizations1 GORDON R. WILLEY Harvard University "Experience has shown that it is hopeless to storm, by a frontal attack, the great citadels of the causality underlying highly com- plex groups of facts." -A. L. KROEBER IN NATIVE America, not a great many centuries after the establishment of a village agricultural way of life, two major art styles of the first rank appear, more or less contemporaneously, in southern Mesoamerica and in northern Peru. These are known as the Olmec and the Chavin. I purpose to consider these two art styles, first, and briefly, as to their content and form and, secondly, but in more detail, in their cultural settings and from the general perspective of New World culture history. For what engages our attention is that both styles occur at that point in time which might be said to mark the very first stirrings of civilization in the Mesoamerican and Peruvian areas. What role did these art styles, or the motivations of which they are the sym- bols, play in the rise and development of pre-Columbian civilizations? Are they, the styles themselves, the touchstones of that condition we refer to as civilization? What do we know of their origins or, if not their origins, their pre- conditions? Like most anthropologists who are interested in culture history I am inter- ested in origins and causes, but I am not sanguine about the possibilities of easy or early victories. Certainly the answers to the ultimate causal questions as to why the ancient American civilizations began and flourished where they did and when they did still elude us, and what I can offer here will do little more, at best, than describe and compare certain situations and series of events. My use of the term "great styles" is a special and intentional one. I refer to art styles and to manifestations of these generally considered as "fine arts" (Kroeber 1957:24-26). Their greatness is judged in their historical contexts, but it is none the less real. These great pre-Columbian art styles of Mesoamer- ica and Peru are expressed monumentally; they occur in settings that were ob- viously sacred or important in the cultures which produced them; they are also pervasive, being reproduced in a variety of media and contexts; the products are rendered with the consummate skill of the specially and long-trained artist; they conform to strict stylistic canons; their subject matter tends to be Read as the Presidential Address at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, held at Philadelphia, November 1961.</page><page sequence="2">2 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 thematic; and finally, the finest monuments or creations in these styles are truly powerful and awe-inspiring. These last criteria are subjective, but I do not think we can ignore them. We see ancient art--the word "primitive" is here most inappropriate-across the millennia and with the eyes of an alien cul- ture; yet we are not unmoved. Man speaks to man through art, and the screen of cultural difference and relativism does not strain out all emotional effect. Olmec and Chavin art measure fully to standards of greatness. OLMEC AND CHAVIN The Olmec style of Mesoamerica has been known for 30 years as such. Stirling (1943) and his associates (Weiant 1943; Drucker 1943, 1952) fully re- vealed the style in their discoveries in southern Veracruz and Tabasco. They and Caso (1942) and Covarrubias (1942, 1946, 1957) made it widely known and also opened the question of its cultural and chronological position in Meso- american culture history (see also Greengo 1952; Coe 1957). Olmec art is ren- dered in life-size, or greater than life-size, full-round, and bas-relief stone monu- ments. These include free-standing heads, human and anthropomorphic figures, stelae, and altars. Carvings are also found on natural boulders after the manner of pictographs, but most of these are done with such skill and are so much a part of the deliberate style, that "bas-relief," rather than "picto- graph," is the fitting term to describe them. Olmec sculptures also occur as small pieces: jade and serpentine figurines, celts, ornamental effigy axes, plaques, and other small ornaments. Ceramic objects in the Olmec style are less common but include figurines, pottery stamps, and vessels. The central theme of Olmec art is a jaguar-human or were-jaguar being. The concept is nearly always expressed as more human, in total characteristics, than jaguar. The face is frequently infantile as well as jaguar-like, and in many instances actual human infant bodies are portrayed. But subtle shades of this infantile jaguarism infect almost all human or anthropomorphic repre- sentations, ranging all the way from only slightly snubbed, feline noses and down-turned drooping mouths to toothed and snarling countenances. Some stelae and monuments bear another concept, elderly men with aquiline noses and beards who are sometimes depicted with portrait realism; but there is also a fusion of the jaguar-like anthropomorph with the bearded man in Olmec iconography (Coe 1960 Ms). Other motifs are rarer: fully animalized jaguars, bird and duck monsters, serpents, and fish. The formal properties of the Olmec style are highly distinctive. Although the subject matter is to a large extent in the mythological realm the portrayals are carried out with a "realistic" intent. It is thoroughly nongeometric and nonabstract; lines have a slow curvilinear rhythm, and free space balances figures. There is little fine detail (Coe 1960 ms). As a style it is the equivalent of any of the later great styles of Mesoamerica, and in the full-round treatment of the human body it is the superior of all. The climax region of the Olmec style was southern Veracruz and Tabasco in such ceremonial center sites as La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and San Lorenzo. In-</page><page sequence="3">WILLEY] Styles and Pre-Columbian Civilizations 3 sofar as the style is expressed monumentally there is little doubt but that this is its homeland. Elsewhere, Olmec monuments are widely scattered and occa- sional. Most are bas-relief figures carved on bloulder outcrops, as in Morelos (Pina Chan 1955), Chiapas (Ferdon 1953), Guerrero (Jimenez Moreno 1959: fig. 4, P1. I-a), Guatemala (Thompson 1948: fig. Ilia), and Salvador (Boggs 1950). Aside from these monuments, portable objects of the Olmec style, such as jade figurines, ornaments, and small manufactures, are found throughout much of southern Mesoamerica, from the Valley of Mexico and Guerrero on the northwest down through Chiapas and Pacific Guatemala. Covarrubias (1957) held the opinion that Guerrero was the ancestral home of the Olmec style, in its pre-monumental era, but it has yet to be demonstrated that the numerous Olmec figurines found in that region are earlier manifestations of the style than the great sculptures of Veracruz-Tabasco. In any event, for our pres- ent discussion, it is sufficient to note that the climax of the "great" aspects of the style are in this latter zone but that the style as a whole is spread over much of southern Mesoamerica. Wherever it can be dated, Olmec art appears in the Middle pre-Classic Period of Mesoamerican history, with an outer dating range of 1000 to 300 B.C., and a probable more specific bracketing by radiocarbon de- terminations of between 800 and 400 B.C. (Drucker, Heizer, and Squier 1959: 248-67). Chavin style art is named for Chavin de Huantar, an imposing archeo- logical site in the Maranon drainage of the north highlands of Peru. Tello, more than any other archeologist, called attention to Chavin art (Tello 1942, 1943, 1960); subsequently, Bennett (1943, 1944), Larco Hoyle (1941), Kroeber (1944:81-93), and Carrion Cachot (1948) made significant contributions (see also Willey 1951; Coe 1954). Like Olmec, the Chavin style is one closely adapted to sculptural forms, both monumental and small. The heroic-sized sculptures are mostly free-standing monoliths or stelae, lintels, cornices, and decorative features of buildings. These are executed with a relief-incision and champleve technique in stone or are modelled in clay. Some full-round carving and modelling is also attempted in heads or figures tenoned or affixed to walls or buildings. Chavin small carving produced stone and bone plaques, stone and gourd vessels, ceremonial stone mortars and pestles, and ornaments. The style also appears in finely modelled and incised pottery vessels, in repousse goldwork, and even in textile designs. In sum, it enters into more varied media than the Olmec style, but both styles are most at home in carving, particularly in large sculptures and in the work of the lapidary. The content of Chavin art, like that of Olmec, deals with a few powerful central themes. With Chavin the dominant motif is either the feline or the fusion of feline elements, such as fangs and claws, with other beings, including humans, condors, the cayman, and the serpent. The fantastic beings of Chavin art emphasize somewhat more the animal attributes than the human, in con- tradistinction to Olmec. Strictly human representations are rare, and none of these have the qualities of portraiture observed in some of the Olmec sculp- tures. Although firmly set in a unified style, the monster or composite beings</page><page sequence="4">4 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 show great variations in the combination of jaguar or puma and other animal elements. The formal properties of the Chavln style, which are its essence, are de- cidedly different from those of Olmec. No one would mistake the two styles in juxtaposition. Chavin is intricate with detail in a way that Olmec is not. It does not employ free space, but seeks to fill it with such things as small secondary heads and eyes disposed over the body of the central monster figure of the sculpture. There is little mastery of realism or naturalism. It has more features that are stiff and "archaic." As styles the two have common ground only in that they rely upon slow heavy curves rather than straight lines, and both have a quality of the esoteric about them rather than the obvious. The heartland of the Chavin style, insofar as it is monumental and in stone or sculptured adobe, is in the north highlands of Peru, at such sites as Chavin de Huantar, Yauya, and Kuntur Wasi, and in the coastal valleys of Nepenia and Casma. This is but one sector of the larger Peruvian culture area, and as such this focal concentration is comparable to the distribution of Olmec art in the Veracruz-Tabasco region within the larger sphere of Mesoamerica. The wider compass of Chavin art, as expressed in small manufactures, takes in much of the Peruvian culture area. Formerly thought to embrace only the northern part of Peru, its definite influence is now traced as far south on the coast as the Cerrillos phase of the Ica and Nazca Valleys (Lanning 1959). Thus, in its total geographic extent Chavin outstrips Olmec, the latter being confined to the southern half, or less, of its culture area setting. Chronologically, Chavin art belongs to the Formative Period of Peruvian prehistory and to either the Early or Middle subdivision of that period, depending upon one's terminology. The gross estimated dates for the Peruvian Formative Period are approxi- mately the First Millennium B.C. Within this range, and with the aid of radio- carbon determinations, the horizon of the Chavin art style is narrowed to be- tween 800 and 400 B.C. (Collier 1959, 1960 Ms; Lanning 1959). As will be noted, this is identical to the dates for the time span estimated for the Olmec style in Mesoamerica. These two sets of dates, incidentally, were arrived at quite independently by different sets of archeologists. OLMEC AND CHAViN IN CULTURE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE As we have already observed, Olmec and Chavin styles make their first ap- pearance on an underlying base of village agriculture. In Mesoamerica, village agriculture, defined as sedentary life based primarily upon maize cultivation, became established by about 1500 B.C., following a long epoch of incipient plant domestication (Willey 1960). The presence of ceremonial architecture, in the form of platform mounds for temples or other buildings, in the early cen- turies of Mesoamerican agricultural life is probable, although not well docu- mented. But by 800 B.C., some 700 years or so after the village agricultural threshold, the great Olmec ceremonial center of La Venta was founded in Tabasco. At the same time that these events were taking place in Mesoamerica, similar and related ones were going on in Peru. At about 1500 B.C. a well-de-</page><page sequence="5">WILLEY] Styles and Pre-Columbian Civilizations 5 veloped variety of Mesoamerican maize appeared in coastal Peru and was rapidly assimilated into the local root-crop agricultural economies of the Peruvian coastal communities (Lanning quoted from Collier 1960; Mangels- dorf, MacNeish, and Willey 1960 Ms). Soon after this the Peruvians were mak- ing pottery and building ceremonial mounds, and to clinch the relationships be- tween Peru and the north at this time, a distinctly Mesoamerican figurine has been found in one of these early Peruvian ceremonial sites known as Las Aldas (Ishida and others 1960, 97 ff.). The Chavin style appears shortly after this. During its period, contact between Mesoamerica and Peru continued. For ex- ample, among the best known traits that have often been pointed to as linking the Olmec phase of Tlatilco and the Chavin Cupisnique phase are figurines, rocker-stamped pottery, incised and color-zoned wares, flat-bottomed open- bowl forms, and the stirrup-mouth jar (Engel 1956; Porter 1953; Willey 1955; Coe 1960). In this setting of an almost exact equation in time, and with further evi- dences of contact in specific ceramic items, can we go further and argue that Olmec and Chavin are definitely related? Drucker (1952:231), Wauchope (1954), and I (Willey 1959) have all called attention to this possibility, and Della Santa (1959) has argued the case in earnest; but on reflection I do not think that the two styles show a close relationship. At least they do not exhibit a relationship which, in the realm of art, is a counterpart to the Mesoamerican maize in Peru or the Tlatilco-Cupisnique ceramic ties. What they possess in common, except for an addiction to sculptural and lapidaristic modes of expres- sion, is largely the concept of the feline being, most probably the jaguar.2 Therefore, their relationship, if it existed, must have been on a level of concept and mythology, either an ancient undercurrent of belief on which both Peruvian and Mesoamerican societies could have drawn to develop quite different art styles or by a stimulus diffusion in which the source idea was drastically reworked in the recipient setting. In this last connection the ex- ample of Mesopotamian stimuli to the rise of early Egyptian civilization comes to mind. If this interpretation of the relationship between Olmec and Chavin is the correct one, I would, all things considered, see Mesoamerica as the source and Peru as in the role of the receiving culture. An argument against a close, continuous Olmec-Chavin relationship on the level of style is, of course, the absence of either style, or any style definitely re- lated to either, in the Intermediate area of Lower Central America, Colombia, and Ecuador. The San Agustin sculptures of southern Colombia are, perhaps, the only candidates (Preuss 1931; Bennett 1946: 848-49); but they are remark- ably unlike either Olmec or Chavin, sharing with them only the attribute of feline-fanged beings, and they are only dubiously dated on the same time level as Olmec and Chavin. Further, as a style, San Agustin is considerably below the quality or sophistication of these great styles (Kroeber 1951). This absence of stylistic linkages in the Intermediate area stands in contrast, however, to many of the significant traits of the village agricultural base out of which Olmec and Chavin seem to have developed. Evidence is rapidly accumulating</page><page sequence="6">6 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 from Ecuador (Evans and Meggers 1957, 1958; Estrada 1958), Colombia (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1959), and Lower Central America (Coe and Baudez 1961) which shows the Intermediate area to be a common participant in early ceramic and other traits held also by Mesoamerica and Peru. A notable ex- ample of this is the striking similarity between Guatemalan Ocos pottery and that of the Ecuadorean Chorrera phase (Coe 1960). Thus, in spite of this back- ground of apparent intercommunication and interchange down and up the axis of Nuclear America, the entities of style which we recognize as Olmec and Chavin remain bound to their respective areas. They did not spread to the Intermediate area, nor can they reasonably be derived from there. THE EARLY GREAT STYLES AS PRECURSORS TO CIVILIZATION We have placed Olmec and Chavin at that point in the developmental his- tory of the Mesoamerican and Peruvian cultures where village farming societies undergo a transformation to become temple center-and-village societies. This event is another major threshold in pre-Columbian life. It is a different kind of threshold than that of village agriculture which precedes it by a few hundred years, but it signals important changes. It is, in effect, the threshold of complex society that leads on to civilization. The economy appears much the same as earlier; it is based on maize, or maize and root crops, supplemented with other American food plants. The technology includes pottery-making, weaving, stone carving-in brief, the village agricultural neolithic arts. Houses were permanent to semi-permanent affairs disposed in small hamlets or villages. The most noticeable difference on the cultural landscape is the ceremonial center. These centers were not urban zones. Heizer (1960) has made quite ex- plicit the nonurban nature of La Venta, and he estimates that the constructions there could have been built and sustained only by the cooperative efforts of villagers from a surrounding radius of several kilometers. Although Chavin de Huantar is situated in a radically different natural environment from La Venta, it, too, appears to have been a complex of ceremonial buildings and chambers without a large resident population in close proximity (Bennett 1944; Tello 1960). It is in such ceremonial centers that the outstanding monuments of the Olmec and Chavin styles are found. In Mesoamerica it is assumed that this ceremonial center-with-outlying hamlets type of settlement pattern is allied with a theocratic political structure. The assumption derives partly from the nature of the settlement and the feeling that such dispersed societies could only have been bound together by strong religious beliefs, but it derives mostly from our knowledge of the late pre- and early post-Columbian periods in Mesoamerica when lowland ceremonial centered societies were known to have a strong theocratic bias. In Peru this kind of theocratic orientation was not a feature of the Inca state; but there the archeological record shows a definite trend, from early to late times, that can best be interpreted as a movement away from religion as a dominant force and the gradual ascendance of secular power (Willey 1951). In the light of such trends it is likely that priest leader-</page><page sequence="7">WILLEY] Styles and Pre-Columbian Civilizations 7 ship was more important in Chavin times than later. Thus, archeological in- ference is on the side of identifying the nonurban ceremonial center as pri- marily a sacred or religious establishment whatever other functions may have been served there. Olmec and Chavin works of art must surely, then, have been religious expressions. This concatenation of circumstances, the shift from simple village agricultural societies to complex temple-centered ones and the appearance of the two great styles, suggests that Olmec and Chavfn are the symbols of two ecumenical religions. These religions lie at the base of the sub- sequent growth of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican and Peruvian civilizations (see Bernal 1960). This fundamental underlying nature of Olmec and Chavin art is revealed in the later cultures and styles in the two areas. For Mesoamerica, Michael D. Coe (1960 Ms) suggests that all known major art styles of the southern part of the area have an origin in the Olmec style. Most directly related among these would be the styles of the slightly later "danzante" monuments at Monte Alban and the Monte Alban I phase effigy incensarios (Caso 1938), the Olmec- derived sculptures from the later pre-Classic Period levels at Tres Zapotes, the Izapa style stelae in Chiapas, and the closely similar Late pre-Classic monu- ments found recently at Kaminaljuyu. More remotely, but nevertheless show- ing affiliations with Olmec art, especially through the link of the Izapa style, would be the Classic Maya and Classic Veracruz styles (Proskouriakoff 1950:177; Covarrubias 1957:166). Further afield, the derivative influences are dimmed or uncertain. Classic Teotihuacan art stands most apart in showing little Olmec influence, and perhaps this may be correlated with the relatively slight impress of Olmec art on an earlier level in the Valley of Mexico where it is known mainly in the occasional Tlatilco ceramic objects. But that some con- nections, however indirect, did exist between Olmec and Teotihaucan icon- ography is shown by Covarrubias (1957: fig. 22) in his diagram of the stylistic evolution of the Teotihuacan and other rain gods from the prototype of the Olmec baby-jaguar face. For Peru, the story is much the same. There, the distribution of the Chavin style was more nearly area-wide. Perhaps as a consequence, nearly all post- Chavin styles show some Chavin feline elements (Willey 1951). Mochica art, of the north coast, depicts a feline or anthropomorphic feline as an apparent deity. Feline symbolism has an important part in Recuay, Pucara, and Nazca cultures. It is present in Tiahuanaco art, although not as the dominant motif. CONSIDERATIONS OF CAUSALITY We see Olmec and Chavin styles at the root of civilization in Mesoamerica and Peru. We also note, in the wider perspective of Nuclear America, that con- temporaneous and related societies of the geographically intervening Inter- mediate area do not possess comparable great styles. Neither do they go on to civilization. From these facts I think we may reasonably conclude that Olmec and Chavin art are in some way involved with the rise to the status of civiliza- tion in their respective areas. But these are observations of history, or pre-</page><page sequence="8">8 American Anthropologist [64, 1962 history, and like all such observations it is difficult and perilous to attempt to read causality into them. In pointing to what I think is a special relationship between the early great styles and civilization, am I not merely defining civil- ization in terms of itself? In a partial sense I am; great art styles are one of the criteria by which the condition of civilization may be judged (Childe 1950). But it is not, however, altogether true in that many of the criteria of civiliza- tion are not yet present in either Mesoamerica or Peru at the time of Olmec and Chavin art florescence. Certainly one of the most significant of these, ur- banization, is not; writing and metallurgy, if present, are only in their infancy; and the institution of the state, in any extensive territorial sense, is highly un- likely. The appearance of the first great styles, then, comes early in the growth of these American civilizations. By the time a full civilizational status has been achieved in either Mesoamerica or Peru these styles, as organized entities, have vanished, leaving only their residue in later styles. Nevertheless, styles themselves cannot be reified into civilization builders. They are, as I have said, symbols of institutions, attitudes, beliefs. Is, then, a belief system, a religion, a prime causal force as Toynbee has stated? I would think so, or at least I consider it near enough to a causal core to speculate on the processes whereby fundamental beliefs and their representative art may promote the growth of civilization. In making these speculations let us consider a hypothesis about culture de- velopment in native America and particularly in the Nuclear American areas. Casting back to earlier chronological ranges than I have been talking about, it is now becoming evident that man changed from a collecting-hunting mode of existence to one of food plant cultivation by a process of introgression. The term is a botanical one, and it applies to what happened to plants over the sev- eral millennia leading up to village agriculture in Mesoamerica; but I also think it applicable to the culture change that went along with the gradual domestica- tion of plants. The studies of Mangelsdorf and MacNeish (Mangelsdorf, Mac- Neish, and Willey 1960 Ms; MacNeish 1958 and personal communication 1961) have shown that original wild plants were found in a great many small locales where they were gathered and used and where seeds were eventually sown and plants tended by small, local populations. With contact between two such small communities, of plants and people, plant introgression and hybrid- ization ensued with a genetically improved result. This process continued among enclaves with both hybridization and with the interchange of different species as well. Present investigations indicate that primitive maize, beans, and squashes do not follow the same sequence of occurrence in incipient agricul- tural stratigraphies in all parts of Mesoamerica but that the order varies from region to region (MacNeish, personal communication 1961). This diversity in development led, eventually, to the New World complex of food plants and to village agriculture. I would suggest that culture, too, evolved along with plants in much the same way, by introgression or interchange and by hybridization or fusion. This, I believe, is an aspect of what Lesser (1961) is saying in his con- cept of social fields. To follow the analogy, I think that this is what continued</page><page sequence="9">WILLEY] Styles and Pre-Columbian Civilizations 9 to happen in the development of cultures and societies after the attainment of village agriculture. Regional interchange or regional symbiosis provided an im- portant impetus for change and growth. Sanders (1956, 1957; Braidwood and Willey 1960 Ms) has detailed this process for parts of ancient Mesoamerica. It led to civilization. In this hypothesis an obviously crucial factor is natural environmental setting and a multiplicity of varied settings in relatively close juxtaposition to one another. As has been pointed out by various authors (eg., Wolf 1959:17- 18), Mesoamerica is well suited in this regard. It is a land of climatic, alti- tudinal, and vegetational variety; it is rich in natural resources. Further, the archeological record shows trade and contact among distinct natural environ- mental and cultural regions from early times. Peru, as well, although not quite so varied, has dramatic regional differentiation, particularly between coast and highland; and the prehistory of that area may be read as a kind of counterpoint between the regional cultures of these natural zones (Kroeber 1927). Contrast the potentialities of these two areas with others of the New World which also had a basis of village agriculture. The natural environmental and cultural contours of differentiation within the Amazon basin or the Eastern Wood- lands of North America are low in comparison. Products from region to region were the same or similar. Perhaps this homogeneity discouraged exchange (Coe 1961 Ms). Are we, now, at a nexus of causality in the rise of pre-Columbian civiliza- tions in certain areas but not in others? Although conceding the importance of intra-areal cultural heterogeneity, and realizing that such heterogeneity must be to a large extent based in natural environment, I am not convinced. What of the Intermediate area which lies between and close to both of our areas of high civilization and which did not match them in these conditions of civilization? It is an area of spectacular regional environmental differentiation, tropical and semi-arid coasts, tropical lowlands, semi-tropical and temperate valleys, cool- temperate uplands. It has them all, and it is not an area poor in resources. We also know that the communities of this area were in possession of agriculture about as early as those of either Mesoamerica and Peru. These village agricul- turists were similarly skilled in pottery making and, probably, the other neolithic crafts. In fact, they participated in the same technical traditions as their Mesoamerican or Peruvian contemporaries. Where then is the lack? What are the essential differences between the Intermediate area and its native cultures and those of the Mesoamerican and Peruvian areas? I return, again, to the great styles, tO Olmec and Chavin, for which there is no counterpart from Honduras to southern Ecuador. I have suggested that they, in themselves, are but the symbols for the religious ideologies of the early farming societies of Mesoamerica and Peru. I would further suggest that in these ideologies these early societies had developed a mechanism of intercom- munication, a way of knitting together the smaller parts of the social universe of their day into a more unified whole than it had heretofore been or would otherwise be. In a way similar to that of the interchange of objects, plants, and</page><page sequence="10">American Anthropologist 10 techniques which had previously prepared the village agricultural threshold, the sharing of common ideologies led to the threshold of civilization by en- larging the effective social field. By this enlargement more individuals, more social segments, more local societies combined and coordinated their energies and efforts than at any time before. Regional differentiation in culture is an important precondition to cultural development insofar as differences con- tribute to the richness of the larger order, but without union the different parts remain isolated and in danger of stagnation. There are various ways by which man has promoted such union, but mutually and deeply held beliefs seem paramount. Such belief systems were, I think, the distinguishing features of the Mesoamerican and Peruvian societies of the first half of the First Millennium B.C., and the great Olmec and Chavin art styles are our clues to them. Yet, even if my thesis is accepted thus far, have we done more than follow the chimaera of causality into one more disguise? Why did Mesoamerica and Peru develop early great religions and art styles and other areas not? What was the reason for their genius? I do not know. I do not think that it sprang from a seed planted by Chinese voyagers-or from two seeds brought by two such sets of voyagers-despite the facts that the Chou dynasty is replete with prowling tigers and that the time element is right for such a transference (Heine- Geldern 1959). It does us no good to deny the sudden mutation of creative change to the aborigines of America. It is no easier to explain elsewhere than it is here. What we are seeking is probably in New World soil, but genius must arise from preconditions which to our eyes do not foreshadow it. Local proto- types of Chavin and Olmec may eventually be found, although these will only carry the story back a little in time and leave the startling florescences unex- plained. I do not reject in their entirety any of the factors or forces we have been dis- cussing as having had possible important influence in the growth of New World civilization. Climate, soil, agricultural potential, natural regional variety, all undoubtedly were significant. I am hesitant, however, to pinpoint any one of them as the cause. I am equally hesitant to advance my thesis of an early, pre- vailing, multi-regional ecumenical religion in either Mesoamerica or Peru as a sole cause of later civilizational greatness. I ask, rather, that such phenomena as I have directed attention to be considered as a step in the process of cultural de- velopment-a step which almost certainly was taken in these two areas of na- tive America. For it may be that we phrase the problem wrong, that the search for the very well-springs of origin and cause is meaningless, and that the limits of anthropology are to appraise and understand the continuum of process as it is disclosed to us rather than to fix its ultimate beginnings.
