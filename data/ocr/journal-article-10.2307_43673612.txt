<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECOLOGIES OF THE MOVING IMAGE: CINEMA, AFFECT, NATURE By Adrian J. Ivakhiv Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2013, 435 pp. REVIEWED BY CHRISTIE MILLIKEN Adrian Ivakhiv s Ecologies of the Moving Image: Cinema , Affect, Nature is a landmark contribution to the expanding field of film ecocriticism that has prolif- erated alongside the cultivation of environmental studies programs across North America over the past two decades. Part of an Environmental Humanities series launched by Wilfred Laurier University Press, this book ambitiously sets out to forge an "ecophilosophy" of cinema, offering a cluster of theoretical templates for assessing the ecological implications of moving images across a range of motion picture practices, including mainstream Hollywood, animation, docu- mentary, global art cinema and the avant-garde. Ivakhiv applies a process-rela- tional view of moving images by creating a framework that combines ideas from such disparate thinkers as Charles Saunders Peirce, Alfred North Whitehead and Gilles Deleuze, among others. A process-relational framework, in his words, "can move us toward a perception of the world in which the sociality (or the anthropomorphic), materiality (or the geomorphic), and the interperceptual realm from which the two emerge are richer, in our perception, than when we started." This argument presupposes that moving images - despite their indisputable and fundamental basis in industrial modernity - have the capacity to be part of the world s ecological solution, not just part of the problem, as is so frequently argued. The introduction to the books conceptual models seems confusing and somewhat overwhelming in the first chapters, where there is mention of many diverse theorists and philosophers from whom his ideas are being extracted. However, by pressing on (and making use of the concise appendix at the end of the book), clarity begins to emerge. One of the strengths of this process- relational model is that it moves beyond a longstanding tradition of Cartesian, binaristic thinking that, in Ivakhiv s view, becomes over-burdened by focusing so exclusively on the negotiation of two fixed, pre-given dualisms. Ivakhiv s goal, repeated throughout the book, is to take into account some measure of how moving images move us: how they invite us to better understand films potential, to revivify our relationship to the world by enabling us to, in his words, "find and articulate new and innovative socio-ecological meanings and capacities." One of the productive aspects of this evolving, dynamic structure of ecologies is Ivakhiv s ECOLOGIES OF THE MOVING IMAGE: CINEMA, AFFECT, NATURE 101</page><page sequence="2">steadfast conviction in "the life" the affect, of moving images. As he eloquently argues: "...a film is what a film does . And what it does is not just what occurs as one watches it. It is also what transpires as viewers mull it over afterwards and as the film reverberates across space between the film world and the real world, seeping into conversation and dreams, tinting the world and making it vibrate in particular ways, injecting thought-images, sensations, motivations, heightened attunements to one thing or another, into the larger social and ecological fields within which films signs, meanings and affects resound." To this end, Ivakhiv considers the ways film can expand our perception of ecological ontology. This, by necessity, includes the ways we understand non-human or "more than merely human" worlds. After the introduction and first chapter that establish his theoretical modeling, the next three chapters deal with the specific ecologies. Chapter 3, for example, summarizes key contributions to understanding the history of modern visuality from the capture of nature s appearance as framed, perspec- tivai view from the Renaissance onward. He rehearses the widely discussed impact of photography in fostering the development of nation-building agendas, which - alongside the development of the railway - bring the masses to nature and later - via the automobile - render almost everything as potential scenery. By weaving through his model for the three dimensions of cinematic worlds he makes the case for how Western pictorial representations of nature have influenced cinematic depictions of landscape and territory, drawing upon the world-making capacities of Dovzhenko s Earth , Pare Lorentz s The Plow That Broke the Plains , a cluster of recent documentaries on the monumental construc- tion of Chinas Three Gorges Dam, Hollywood westerns, Jennifer Baichwal and Edward Burtynsky s Manufactured Landscapes , and the work of Stan Brakhage and James Benning, to name a few. His discussion of how notions of the sublime and more recently, the eco-sublime have been theorized in relation to nature and industrial landscapes (Antonioni) is particularly evocative here. The fourth chapter, on anthropomorphism and the ethnographic impulse, begins with a discussion of anthropomorphism in Nanook of the North, and moves on to readings of King Kong, Aguirre and several other Werner Herzog films, The Wicker Man, Daughters of the Dust, Atanarjuat and many others. The anthropo- morphic promise of cinema, he argues, is its capacity to enable us to become more "genuinely human" or alternatively, become "something else we can only dream of" by opening up the world, to enable us to realize our capacity to act in and through it and to imagine change. This enumeration of texts suggests something of the scope, ambition and sheer volume of coverage in this 400-page manuscript. This is both the book s strength and its weakness. Ecologies is clearly written for "the initiated" of some persuasion, be that upper-year undergraduate or graduate students, scholars with an established knowledge base in either environmental humanities, 102 BOOK REVIEWS | COMPTES RENDUS</page><page sequence="3">ecophilosophy, or, more specifically, film and communication studies. Reading the book was a reminder of films I need to see, and some I am now eager to revisit with his ecological frame in mind, a sign of this book s success. Sometimes, however, the listing/ enumerating is overwhelming and makes me yearn for more fully developed attention to some truly fascinating debates that he certainly points toward but leaves underdeveloped. In addition, the book is poorly indexed. For example, E. Ann Kaplan is cited in several chapters in the book, both with respect to gaze and trauma theory, though only the former shows up in the index. The fifth chapter, on biomorphism, is where Ecologies of the Moving Image really begins to sharpen and cohere. Here Ivakhiv weaves together the three "morphogenetic" registers that have thus far been explained as separate chapters. Cleverly entitled "Anima Moralia," this chapter compellingly demon- strates Ivakhiv s thesis, that these domains must be understood as an insepar- able, process-relational unity. This is demonstrated through the theme of movement, of our own cognitive and affective involvement in films, specifically in relation to forms of biomorphism presented across nature and wildlife docu- mentaries, animation (Disney) and horror. While discussion of some of these texts has become standard in eco film criticism, Ivakhiv draws on and eloquently summarizes debates about March of the Penguins, Bambi, Happy Feet, Winged Migration, Grizzly Man, and Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill He also briefly recalls some of the best-known "blue-chip" documentaries, particularly the internation- ally co-produced Planet Earth (2006) in relation to the traditional nature docu- mentary formula: "eating, being eaten and the stunning visual beauty of it all." His discussion of reception and of interpretive communities that have sprung up around these films here and elsewhere in the book shows a keen ability to navigate both critical and fan writing, filtering issues of psychic investment, and negotiating debates about the always uneasy bridge between educating, understanding and entertaining that comes with all pedagogical missions. He draws upon aesthetic issues, visual effects, even ancillary "making of" texts in DVD packaging, all of which amounts to a somewhat dizzying but ultimately successful journey across a range of discursive frontiers. The books afterward, subtitled "Digital Futures in a Biosemiotic World", takes some measure of how digitization and the explosive growth of new imaging technologies are bringing an entirely new image sensibility upon us. Ivakhiv, nonetheless, manages to make this short chapter unlike so many generic "new technologies" meditations at the end of film studies books. Arguing that, despite the need for a new grammar, for new ways to account for new techno- logical delivery and production, even the move away from the medium of single films with singular arcs etc., digital imaging is still fundamentally about movement and affect. In this regard, while the stakes are different and ever- changing: "Perhaps the least we can say about cinema is that it is movement, ECOLOGIES OF THE MOVING IMAGE: CINEMA, AFFECT, NATURE 103</page><page sequence="4">and that when movement becomes as pervasive as it has become, the task for a philosophy of cinema also changes." From his process-relational view, with all things always becoming, cinema has always been with us, however its forms and formats change as we migrate from a petrochemical industrial civilization to a digitalized, postindustrial, postmodern geopolitical frontier. Small wonder Ecologies of the Moving Image returns to the canonical ecophilosphical film that begins this book when Ivakhiv revisits Andrei Tarkovsky s Stalker to conclude. Like Tarkovsky s Stalker himself who is, in many ways the stalked, Ivakhiv reads cinema as a stalker of the world. It is cinemas stalking, he artfully surmises, that has created the myriad worlds that stalk us if and when we allow them to. That this book might have an equally penetrative effect on the minds of its readers is beyond a doubt. Brock University 104 BOOK REVIEWS | COMPTES RENDUS</page></plain_text>
