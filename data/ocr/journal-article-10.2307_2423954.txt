ROOD Department of Zoology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48823 ABSTRACT: The behavior and ecology of a population of individual- ly marked Microcavia australis was studied in a xerophytic thornbush habitat in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, from April 1966 to Octo- ber 1967. Another cavy, Galea musteloides, occurred in smaller numbers on the study area. Interactions between the two genera were amicable. Microcavia births occurred from August to April with most litters born in the September-December period. Gestation was 54 days. One female gave birth to four litters during the breeding season. Adult males have home ranges of approximately ?4 hectare, about twice the size of female home ranges. Microcavia is diurnal and may be active at any time of day. Most social interactions occur in the bare areas surrounding thorn- bush associations. Communal rolling sites are loci for olfactory com- munication. Interactions between adult males are agonistic and orga- nized by a straight-line dominance hierarchy. Males congregate around the home bush of a female near term; a conspicuous mating chase occurs at the post-partum estrus. Juveniles may suckle from lactating females other than the mother. Adult males associate with juveniles and respond sexually to them. Females maintain amicable relations with their daugh- ters until the birth of the next litter. Many behavioral similarities be- tween Microcavia and sciurid ecological equivalents, such as Citellus and Cynomys, are convergently evolved adaptations to open habitats. Microcavia social organization is more similar to that of rabbits (which also have a high reproductive potential and high mortality rate) than to sciurid ecological equivalents. INTRODUCTION The South American hystricomorph rodents have rarely been studied in their native environment. Investigations of field ecology have been made on only a few genera, namely Lagidium (Pearson, 1948), Lagostomus (Llanos and Crespo, 1952) and Ctenomys (Pear- son, 1959). The following account summarizes field investigations of the ecology and social interactions of the desert cavy, Microcavia australis, made as part of a larger study of the three Argentine genera of Caviinae. Microcavia is a particularly suitable genus for behavioral field work as it is diurnal and occupies open habitats where it can be observed easily. Information on the genera Cavia and Galea, and on the behavior of a captive population of Microcavia, will be presented in a subsequent paper. Microcavia australis is one of the most abundant and widespread of Argentine mammals. It inhabits a semiarid environment and is able to live in the absence of ground vegetation where it climbs bushes and low trees to feed on leaves and fruits. The local Spanish name for all cavies is "cuis" and Microcavia is sometimes referred to as "cuis chico." In the northern provinces it also goes under the name of "coi." Cabrera (1961) divides the genus into two subgenera: Monticavia and Microcavia. Monticavia is endemic to the high Andes of Bolivia 415</page><page sequence="2">416 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) and may also occur in northern Chile and southwestern Peru. The subgenus Microcavia occurs throughout most of Argentina with the exception of the humid northeastern provinces. Cabrera recognizes two species, Microcavia shiptoni, found in northwestern Argentina above 300 m altitude, and M. australis occurring from the north- western provinces south to the Santa Cruz River and possibly to the Straits of Magellan. The present work concerns a population of the southernmost of the three Argentine subspecies, M. a. australis, studied in the extreme south of the Province of Buenos Aires. Superficially, Microcavia resembles a small tailless ground squirrel (Fig. 1). Adult M. a. australis ordinarily slightly exceed 200 mm in total length and weigh between 200 and 300 g. The northern form (M. a. salinia), however, is much larger, sometimes exceeding 500 g in weight. The dorsal coloration is olive gray agouti, and the ventral pelage is pale gray. The eye is large and surrounded by a prominent white eye ring. METHODS Observation of individually marked animals was the principal technique employed in the study. Eight visits were made to the study area comprising the following periods: (1966) 13-23 April, 17-25 May, 8-13 July, 9-18 September, 26 October-1 November, 11-22 December; and (1967) 7-17 February and 21 September-11 October. As an aid to recording movements and activities, numbered stakes were placed at 15-m intervals dividing the 1.8-hectare area into 81 squares. Thirty National Live-traps were used in the study. These Fig. 1. Microcavia in attend posture</page><page sequence="3">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 417 were placed in runways, usually where they entered bushes. Ten squares did not contain runways and traps were not placed in these or in the outermost row of squares. Traps were placed in the 39 trappable squares two to a square and moved every three days. They were checked every four hours, and more frequently on rainy or very hot or cold days. When an animal was trapped for the first time it was etherized and its total length measured. It was then weighed to the nearest gram, checked for ectoparasites and its reproductive condition recorded. Animals were permanently marked by clipping combinations of toes; only one was clipped on each foot. They were marked for later field identification with Nyanzol dye. Nine easily recognizable symbols were selected and each animal was marked with two, corresponding to its number from toe clipping. Males were marked on the back and rump and females on each side and the rump. A spot on the nape was used for animals whose number exceeded 100. Animals recaptured in a subsequent study period were remarked and reweighed. With known age animals, i.e., those trapped as juve- niles, the total length was again measured. One hundred twenty Micro- cavia were marked on the study area. In addition, 14 animals were marked on a nearby area in the September-October 1967 visit. Microcauja is quick to detect a moving object and it is thus neces- sary to remain motionless while observing it. Most of my observations were made from a car using 9 X or 7 X binoculars, but some were also made from a chair in the open. A total of 365 hours was spent in field observations. In addition, many hours were spent in walking about the area to obtain data on home range and activity. Notes were taken by hand and summarized each night. A Norelco tape recorder was also occasionally employed. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA The study area was located on the farm, "La Cristina," of Sr. Gabriel Walter, situated in the extreme south of Buenos Aires Province, 14 km SE of the town of Cardenal Cagliero and 40 km NE of Carmen de Patagones. It was established in the center of a level plot of xerophytic thornbush scrub (Fig. 2) commonly called "monte" in Spanish. The plot measures 4 km X 1 km and is bordered by wheat fields to the west, south and east and a dirt road and field to the north. The climate is characterized by scant rainfall, strong winds, hot summers with temperatures occasionally exceeding 40 C and moderate winters with snow a rarity. During the February 1966-January 1967 period the hottest month was January (mean 29.5 C) and the coldest month July (mean 13 C). Mean wind velocity varied from 20 km/hr in January to 13 km/hr in July. The total rainfall for the year, recorded in Cardenal Cagliero, was 311 mm. Mean monthly rainfall for 1966-67 varied from 0 mm in September to 107 mm in June. Except for brief periods following a heavy rain, standing water did not occur on the study area.</page><page sequence="4">418 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) Fig. 2.-View of study area showing thornbush associations and bare areas surrounding them In the phytogeographic classification of Cabrera (1953), the study area is located in a transition zone between espinal and monte. The dominant vegetation is composed of two species of thornbushes, Schinus fasiculatus and Condalia microphylla. Although these may occur as separate bushes they usually grow together in clumps (Fig. 2). A less common thornbush, Lycium gilliesianum, is found on the study area only in association with Schinus and Condalia. The associations of these three bushes grow to a height of 2-3 m and may exceed 33 m in circumference. They provide Microcavia with cover and with food in the form of leaves, shoots, flowers and fruits. The leaves of Schinus are preferred to the other two species and the lower half of a bush may be completely stripped. Schinus and Lycium flower in September and bear their red berries in December; Condalia has flowers in December and berries in February. The other common bush on the study area is Chuquiraga erinacea, which resembles European gorse. It is too small to provide more than temporary cover and is ignored by cavies except in September-October when the tender new leaves are eaten.

The area is periodically grazed by sheep and horses and the ground vegetation is kept cropped by the combined actions of cavies and these animals. In an area where Microcavia is abundant, every thornbush associa- tion large enough to provide it with cover is surrounded by an area of bare soil one to two meters in width (Figs. 2 and 3). These areas are kept bare by the combined foraging and trampling activities of the cavies and are the sites where most social behavior occurs. Runways 5-7-cm wide connect occupied clumps of bushes and are also kept clear of vegetation. Droppings are scattered around the perimeter of the bushes and tend to accumulate where runways enter the bushes and near preferred resting sites. They measure approximately 11-mm long X 2-mm wide, are slightly curved and taper at the ends. Fresh drop- pings are black but lighten in color with age. The relative abundance of cavies in a given area can be deduced from the number of drop- pings, and condition of the runways and the bare areas around bushes. Runways and bare areas quickly become overgi own in areas where populations are low. Microcavia digs out shallow depressions under the bush associations where it rests during inclement weather and sleeps at night. Some clumps also contain holes. One burrow system with three surface entrances was excavated after the association of bushes had been removed (Fig. 4). The main tunnel was 134-cm long and 5 cm in diameter. Its maximum depth below the surface was 28 cm. No enlarged chambers, nests or droppings were found beneath the surface. Fig. 3.

If a cavy is beside a bush when a predator appears, it may sit motion- less, allowing a close approach. However, if it is foraging in the open when it detects a predator, it immediately dashes. to the nearest bush. The most important and destructive of the ground predators at La Cristina is the grison (Galictis cuja). This small (about one kg) black mustelid is ideally adapted to capture Microcavia, which appears to have little defense against it. Grisons were common on the study area in the spring and summer of 1966-67, when one or more were seen nearly every day. At this time they posed a serious problem to the study as they would maim and kill cavies soon after these were live-trapped. On one occasion a grison was observed to run down and kill a male Microcavia. The cavy ran within 0.5 m of an observer, closely pursued by the grison; both dashed into a bush and a sharp scream was heard. The grison then became aware of a, human presence, dropped the dying cavy by the bush, and ran off. On another occasion several screams were heard from a bush at dusk and a grison ran from it as, an observer approached. The only other predation observed on the study area was by a feral domestic cat; it entered a bush and lay in wait and a few minutes later caught a male Microcavia which followed a female into the bush. However, cats are rare on the study area and only one other cat was seen in the course of the study. Gray foxes (Dusicyon gymnocercus) were commonly seen trotting through the area singly or in pairs but were not observed to take an interest in cavies. On one occasion a cavy was seen beginning to circle a bush and then dashing into it as, a fox trotted past 10 m away, apparently ignoring this, prospective meal. In Santiago del Estero Province a fox (Dusicyon culpaeus) trotted around a Microcavia colony every evening at dusk for a week. The cavies 14mDe-pth( Dprsio 25crn- Xm 28cm NoN\ Surface runway Fig. 4.-Excavated burrow of Microcavia australis viewed from above</page><page sequence="7">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 421 would give the alarm call, a "tsit," and dash for the nearest hole. I was usually aware of the fox's approach before I saw it, from the cavy behavior. The trapping of a skunk (Conepatus casteneus) in a Micro- cavia runway at La Cristina indicates another possible ground preda- tor. Birds of prey are uncommon at La Cristina. Three species of hawks (Buteo polyosoma, Falco fuscocaerulescens, and Circus cyaneus) were occasionally observed flying over the study area but were not seen to take cavies. Another possible avian predator is a species of owl (Asio flammeus) which sometimes visited the area. OTHER ASSOCIATES Microcavia associates with a variety of other vertebrates, many of which utilize its runways for foraging, since they facilitate entry to the thornbush thickets. Birds frequently trapped in cavy runways were: a mockingbird (Mimus patagonicus), a rhinocriptid (Rhinocrypta lanceolata) and a furnarid (Pseudoseisura guttaralis). Two other species, Zonotrichia capensis and Upcerthia dumetaria were less com- monly trapped on the study area. Mockingbirds were particularly common and frequently stole pieces of apple from baited traps. A fast low-flying bird which passes directly over-a cavy causes a dash for the nearest bush. However, Microcavia ignores birds foraging near it, although the fast-hopping approach of a mockingbird or Rhinocrypta may cause a rapid retreat. The large lizard, Teius teyou, was occasionally seen in cavy run- ways. Two species of mice, Akodon sp. and Phyllotis griseoflavus, were trapped in Microcavia runways. Phyllotis was common and was often taken in traps set overnight. A young Phyllotis was once seen sitting with two one-day-old Microcavia at the edge of a bush in the early morning. European hares (Lepus europaeus) and Patagonian hares (Dolichotis patagonum) occasionally visited the study area. Microcavia sometimes uses the holes of larger mammals. Arma- dillos (Chaetophractus villosus) are fairly common at La Cristina and cavies run into their holes when frightened. I have often observed Microcavia using the holes of vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus) in the provinces of Santiago del Estero and La Pampa, and it is said to take over vizcacheras whenever these are abandoned. At La Cristina vizcachas have been eliminated but an old vizcachera surrounded by Stipa grass occurs on an open part of the study area. No bushes grow in its vicinity and the area is avoided by Microcavia. RELATIONSHIPS WITH GALEA The yellow-toothed cavy (Galea musteloides) is sympatric with Microcavia at La Cristina but less abundant. A total of 17 Galea was marked on the study area (compared with 120 Microcavia). Social relationships between the two genera are amicable. They use the same runways and are frequently seen foraging and sitting together in groupings that may involve any combination of ages or sexes. Social grooming occurs between the two genera, the initiator approaching</page><page sequence="8">422 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) and nibbling his partner on the nape or back. The groomer may be either a Galea or Microcavia. Once a young Galea nuzzled under the venter of a female Microcavia apparently attempting to suckle. It subsequently followed the Microcavia into a bush. Only two cases of interspecific aggression were recorded, both involving a Galea chasing a Microcavia. The geographic distribution of Galea and Microcavia in Argentina is nearly coincident and they commonly occupy the same habitats. Galea was sympatric with Microcavia in both of two areas sampled in La Pampa and Santiago del Estero and in both Microcavia was more abundant. The sympatric occurrence of the two genera has also been recorded at Tostado, Province of Santa Fe (Contreras, 1966), where I also observed them. POPULATION DYNAMICS AND REPRODUCTION WEIGHT AND TOTAL LENGTH Adult Microcavia typically have total lengths of approximately 200-220 mm and body weights exceeding 200 g. The maximum male weight obtained in the study was 244 g; pregnant females sometimes approach 400 g. Figures 5a and 5b show the total lengths and body weights of two females trapped soon after birth and on each subse- quent visit until the ages of three and six months, respectively. The un- connected dots show the data for known-age animals living in outdoor pens. Newborn Microcavia typically have a total length of slightly less than 100 mm and weigh about 35 g. The smallest animal trapped at La Cristina, aged less than one day, was 95 mm long and weighed 34 g. Cavies are here termed juveniles when less than one month, ad- olescents when one to three months, and adults when over three months old. Animals of unknown age were classed on the basis of total length and weight. Month-old Microcavia weigh approximately 110 g and are about 150 mm long. Relative age of young animals can be estimated fairly accurately up to about three months, when their total length is approximately 180 mm and their weight approximately 180 g. Mean weights of animals over three months in age or with total lengths exceeding 190 mm where age is unknown-for the months when trapping was conducted, are shown in Figure 6. Males tend to be heaviest in the spring, when breeding is at its height and the testes reach maximum size. Female weights fluctuate widely with reproduc- tive condition and are highest during spring and summer when the majority are pregnant or lactating. POPULATION SIZE AND VARIATION When the study commenced in April 1966, 44 Microcavia were trapped on the 1.8-hectare study area, a density of 24.4/hectare. Table 2 gives the estimated population size of males, females and juveniles</page><page sequence="9">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 423 on the study area in the months studied. The estimates were obtained by combining the number of animals trapped, animals not trapped but identified from their dye marks, and animals not trapped or seen but trapped on a previous and subsequent trip (shown in parentheses). A few unmarked animals were present in all months studied. In 1966, the population was lowest in July. It was highest in September due to the presence of 13 juveniles and an influx of adult males. The mean population estimate of the months studied in 1966 is 43 Microcavia (23.9/hectare). By February 1967, the population had dropped to 15 animals and in September-October 1967, only two animals were present.

GALEA POPULATION SIZE Galea reached its maximum population estimate of eight in April and October 1966 (Table 2). In 1966 Galea made up from 10-20% of the total cavy population. In Februray 1967, no marked animals were present but an unmarked animal was occasionally seen. No Galea was seen in the September-October 1967 study period. MORTALITY Of the 44 Microcavia trapped in April 1966, 11 were still on the study area the following December and only 5 by February 1967. Table 3 shows the percentage of animals, excluding juveniles, lost (i.e., not subsequently seen or trapped) between each study period from April 1966 to February 1967.

Although some of this population loss could theoretically be a result of emigra- tion, I have no evidence of this and marked animals were never seen far from the study area. I believe mortality, largely due to predation, accounted for the majority of population loss. Except in the July- September 1966 period, mortality was slightly higher in males than in females. The loss to the population of juvenile Microcavia was par- ticularly high. Of the 17 juveniles marked in 1966 only four were still present on a subsequent visit. By February 1967, 72% of the Micro- cavia present the previous December had disappeared from the popula- tion and no marked animals were trapped the following September. Some mortality resulted from the trapping. Two animals died in less than four hours in 35 C heat, and a juvenile was accidentally killed with an overdose of ether. In December and February, four animals were killed in the traps by Galictis cuja and another had its leg bitten off. Grisons are found throughout the distribution range of Microcavia and may have been the factor responsible for the virtual elimination of the cavy population on the study area by September 1967. These animals were first observed in October 1966 and began to be common by December. In this month three young animals were observed frisking together and may have been born on the, study area in October, the season of births according to Cabrera and Yepes (1940). Grisons were seen nearly every day in February 1967, and by September 1967 cavies were very scarce on the study area and most formerly used runways were overgrown with vegetation. Microcavia was abundant in a strip of thornbush scrub approximately one kilometer from the study area sur- rounded by plowed fields where I eventually concentrated my observa- tions. In nearly three weeks' work on this area grisons were never seen. REPRODUCTION Breeding Season.-At La Cristina, births were recorded over about nine months of the year. In 1966, one female had a litter of two in April, but no pregnant females or juveniles were found in May or July. Births probably commenced in August since a few young animals, estimated to be about a month old on the basis of total length and weight, were trapped in early September. Table 4 shows the numbers and percentages of females over three months in age which were pregnant or lactating in the months studied. Pregnancy in females within about three weeks of term could be determined by palpation, but early stages of pregnancy were missed. However, except at the commencement of reproduction, a female in the early stages of pregnancy was also ordinarily lactating and thus considered a breeding female. Most litters are born in the spring. Between 73-91% of the females on the study area from September- December 1966, and all six females trapped in a strip of thornbush scrub one kilometer from the main study area in September-October 1967, were pregnant or lactating. Litter Size.-Caution must be used in estimating litter size from</page><page sequence="13">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 427 nursing observations since lactating females may nurse young from two or more litters at the same time. Of 14 litters in which juveniles of the same size continually associated with one female for at least several days, there was one litter of one, nine litters of two, and four litters of three. In captivity litters of four and five were sometimes born. The mean litter size of 16 litters in which the young were born alive was 2.8 ? .3. Litters were born in October, November, December and February in captivity. Gestation and Estrous Cycle.-Since a postpartum estrus occurs shortly after parturition, the gestation period was estimated from the interval between consecutive litters. In captivity, the mean of the six gestations in which the young survived was 54.2 ? .4 days (range 53-55 days). Gestations of 51 and 52 days were also recorded but in both these cases the young appeared to be premature and died a few hours after birth. Data on a female at La Cristina provide further evidence of a 54-day gestation period. F75 gave birth on 31 October 1966, was pregnant again when trapped on 14 December, and gave birth to her third litter on 17 February 1967. A captive female came into estrus and mated 15 days after giving birth, thus suggesting a 15- day cycle length in Microcavia. Numbers of Litters/Year.-Assuming a gestation period of 54 days, a female Microcavia could theoretically produce five litters in a breed- ing season lasting from August to April if she conceived at each post- partum estrus. Of the three marked adult females on the study area from September 1966 to August 1967, one gave birth to four, one to three and one to two litters. Age at First Breeding.-Females born in the spring ordinarily come into estrus and mate when 40-50 days old but may not conceive at this time. Two young females seen to mate at their first estrus in December did not become pregnant, but another, caught as a juvenile in September, was pregnant when subsequently trapped at approximately 82 days of age. A captive female produced her first litter when 139 days old, so presumably conceived at approximately age 85 days. Although females born late in the breeding season come into estrus and TABLE 4.-Microcavia female reproduction No. females No. females more than 3 pregnant or (%) months old lactating Breeding 1966 April 10 1 10 May 10 0 -- July 9 0 -- September 13 10 77 October 1 1 10 91 December 11 8 73 1967 February 4 1 25 Sept.-Oct.* 6 6 100 * Not on study area.</page><page sequence="14">428 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) mate, they may not conceive before the following spring. F69, bom in April, was in estrus and seen to mate in July when 85 days old, but she did not produce her first litter until the following October. Testes can usually be felt in the scrotum of young males when they are about 40 days old, and they ordinarily remain scrotal throughout life. Adult males with nonscrotal testes were occasionally trapped, however. HOME RANGE The study area was divided, using numbered stakes as markers, into 81 squares, each 225m2. The numbers of the squares where each animal was observed or trapped were recorded each day. When a marked cavy was observed outside the study area, the distance to the nearest stake was measured and the square later plotted on the range map for that individual. Although the surrounding area was frequently checked for marked animals these were not seen more than 40 m from the boundary of the study area. Since seasonal shifts. in the home ranges of adults were not observed and the number of records in any month were usually in- sufficient to show the full extent of individual ranges, I consider the total records of each individual in all months to be the best estimate of its home range, and home range is thus- here defined as the total area utilized by an animal throughout the period of study. Area of home range was estimated by the exclusive boundary strip method (Stickel, 1954). It was found that range size increased as a function of number of records until about 50 records were obtained. I have therefore used only the five male and three female residents for which more than 50 records were available. The maximum number of range observations on any animal was 164. Table 5 indicates that adult males have home ranges of approximately 3/4 hectare, about twice the size of female ranges. The largest male range was approxi- mately one hectare while the maximum home range recorded for a female was .4 hectare. Home ranges of most animals were centered in the southwest section of the study area. All animals avoided the open area of vizcacha grass (Stipa) in the northeast section of the area which comprised approximately 3000 M2. Male home ranges overlap and often approximately coincide. Although females may defend the area around their home bush from other females, overall home ranges often overlap, and two or more females sometimes occupy the same home bush and have coincident home ranges.

Although a male frequently visits several females in the course of a day's activity, he may concentrate on a small part of his overall home range for several days when attracted by a pregnant female near term. For example, from 13-16 December 1966, M32 and M35 restricted their activities to the home bush of pregnant F69. After parturition on 16 December they spent most of their time at the home bush of F145 - 75 m west of F69's bush and slightly off the study area - until the birth of her litter on 19 December. MAINTENANCE BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY FEEDING BEHAVIOR A foraging Microcavia moves forward or to the side with the head lowered. When a grass or forb has been selected, it typically is clipped at the base with the incisors and chewed from base to tip. Short vegetation may be eaten from tip to base; when the plant is partly consumed, the remainder is often grasped near the base with the in- cisors and pulled out with a backward movement of the head. While chewing, the animal is alert with head raised. Forbs and grass blades including the seed heads are usually entirely consumed. The forepaws are never used to hold the food, although they may sometimes help support it against the ground. At La Cristina, leaves of Condalia, Schinus and Lycium bushes are available throughout the year. Leaves on the lower branches are eaten first. If they are out of reach, a cavy may stand upright, grasp the tip of the branch with the forepaws, and pull the leaves within reach of the mouth. When the lower leaves have been completely stripped and eaten, Microcavia may climb to obtain food. Schinus leaves ap- pear to be preferred and a bush may occasionally be completely stripped. Berries, buds and flowers are eaten in season. A Microcavia was once observed about one meter off the ground in a Condalia bush stripping and eating the bark. Cavies were never seen to drink on the study area, in the rare instances, i.e., after a heavy rain, when standing water was available. Presumably they obtain sufficient water from succulent vegetation. SLEEPING AND RESTING POSTURES The commonest of these is the rounded posture with all four feet pulled under the body, the head pulled in, and the eyes closed. Some- times one front leg is raised. Microcavia often sit by their home bushes in the rounded posture with the head raised and eyes open (Fig. 3). After several minutes, if undisturbed, the head may slowly sink and the eyes close as the animal rests. In cold weather cavies sit out of the wind on the sunny side of the bush, and the rounded posture helps to conserve body heat by re- ducing surface area. In warm weather Microcavia may rest the venter on the ground and stretch the hind legs straight behind or oc-</page><page sequence="16">430 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) casionally splayed out at a 450 angle. They may also lie on their side with the front feet pointing forward. Cavies rest only in or at the edge of a bush, never in the open. LOCOMOTION Diagonal limb coordination is used for relatively slow movements around the bushes and while foraging. It is also employed in climbing but a Microcavia often jumps the last 0.5 m when descending fronm a bush. Quadrupedal saltation is employed for fast movement. When moving between bushes, the animal first moves cautiously, stopping occasionally with the head stretched forward (stretched attend). It ordinarily stops about three times in the first third of the distance between two bushes; then runs directly to its destination. However, males searching for estrous females run between bushes without stopping, with the nose held near the ground. Juveniles occasionally make one or a series of upward jumps into the air, termed frisky hops. These are nondirected and appear to be a spontaneous release of excess energy. Frisky hops are also occasionally seen in sexually aroused adult males. COMFORT MOVEMENTS As here defined, these include yawning, stretching, and shaking, as well as patterns involving care of the body surface such as grooming and rolling. In basic situations, i.e., when serving their primary func- tions, most comfort movements are caused by peripheral stimuli such as skin irritations and ectoparasites, and they function mainly to re- move these irritations and maintain the pelage in good condition. During social interactions comfort movements also sometimes occur i-n apparently irrelevant situations in which their causation is less easy to determine. Grooming.-The front feet, hind feet and mouth (incisors, nose and tongue) are the parts of the body involved in grooming the pelage. Terms used to describe the motions are face wipes, scratching, nibbling, licking, nosing and combing. a. Face wipes. The proximal surface of the front foot is drawn over the side of the head from the eye or ear to nose tip. Face wipes are most frequently alternate, involving several strokes of one front foot and then several strokes of the other. The animal may also adopt an upright posture and use both front feet together. b. Scratching. Rapid pendular strokes of the hind foot are used to clean the sides and head. c. Nibbling and Licking. Any part of the body behind the neck may be groomed by nibbling with the incisors. The feet are groomed both by nibbling and licking. Males sometimes lick and nuzzle the everted penis, especially when sexually aroused. The animal raises its rear slightly and shakes it with convulsive thrusting movements to evert the penis, then draws it under and sits in an upright posture on the haunches.</page><page sequence="17">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 431 d. Nosing. This is immediately preceded by face wipes with the Microcavia in an upright posture. It then runs the nose through the pelage with downward directed strokes along the sides and venter. Nosing progresses posteriorly and is usually accompanied by combing with the front feet. The head region is most commonly groomed by face wipes, while nibbling is the commonest method of grooming all other areas. Groom- ing most frequently occurs preceding, during or following periods of rest. Rolling.-Typically a Microcavia lies on its side and rotates the head and foreparts onto the back. The hindquarters may also be rotated and the hind legs swung over; at times the body may be slightly flexed. Frequently a cavy rolls only once and then lies on its side with the head raised, but it may roll as many as six times on one or alter- nate sides. Microcavia often sniff or paw the ground before rolling. Most rolling occurs at specific rolling sites, creating shallow depressions. These are of communicatory significance; passing animals often sniff them and may urinate or do a perineal drag. A perineal drag may also immediately follow rolling and probably functions to mark the site with the secretion of the adanal glands. Stretch, Yawn, Shake.-Yawn and stretch frequently immediately precede or follow a period of rest. A shake of the head or body is often associated with a grooming sequence. Elimination.-During defecation, Microcavia freeze and squat slightly. Feces are dropped at random about the bush areas tending to accumulate at runway entrance points. Urination occurs from a standing posture with the rear slightly raised. I have most frequLently observed it at rolling sites and at entrances to bushes, where cavies often stop and urinate before entering. I have occasionally observed refection in Microcavia. A sitting animal lowers its head to lick its anal region, then raises it and makes chewing motions; this is usually repeated several times. A young Microcavia was once observed chewing a fecal pellet. DIGGING AND AREA MAINTENANCE Digging in the field was only observed once, when a four-day-old juvenile dug a shallow depression under a bush. However, digging was common in captive animals. Microcavia dig with several strokes of each front foot working alternately. Loosened soil is kicked out behind with the hind feet. Old droppings and other debris are scratched from the runways and bare areas encircling the bushes with laterally or posteriorly directed strokes of the front feet. Twigs which fall on the runways are picked up and moved aside with the mouth. ATTEND POSTURES These are frozen alert postures (Fig. 1). A Microcavia may sit with front legs extended or one raised, stand, or adopt an upright posture.</page><page sequence="18">432 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) The head is raised and if the direction of the stimulus has not been located, it may be turned from side to side and the animal may run back and forth. In the stretched attend, the head is stretched toward the stimulus. The posture assumed in attend depends on the activity of the animal when it first detects a novel stimulus. If resting, it opens its eyes and raises its head. If moving, it freezes in a standing position and may adopt the stretched attend. Microcavia often respond to the alarm calls of birds with an attend and sometimes a quick dash to cover. They also respond to the attends of other cavies. The commonest vocalization, a "tsit," is given at the approach of possible danger and functions to alert other animals in the immediate area. Cavies frequently sit in attend by a bush for a few minutes before leaving it. An attend is also a frequent prelude to social behavior. DAILY ACTIVITY In a typical day, rest periods are interspersed with bouts of forag- ing, grooming, exploration and social interactions. Preferably one should observe the temporal patterning of these activities throughout the entire daily cycle at various times of the year. However, at La Cristina, the nature of the thornbush habitat precludes continuous observation of individuals from a stationary site, and I found it im- possible to move about the study area without affecting the activity of the animals. On each visit from July 1966 to February 1967, I spent one full day, from daybreak until dark, recording the number of Microcavia present in each 30 min period on an 1125 m2 area on the densely populated southwest section of the study area. The numbers of animals seen varied little throughout the day (Table 6), indicating that Microcavia may be active at any time of day. How- ever, temperatures over 35 C tend to inhibit activity. During several unusually hot days in February 1967, cavies were only observed out of the bushes in the early morning and late afternoon. Microcavia will forage in a light drizzle but a heavy rain sends them dashing for the nearest bush. I have no evidence of nocturnal activity. Animals were never observed on the study area during trapping checks after dark, and cavies freed from traps at night appeared disoriented and tended to freeze at the point of release. DESCRIPTION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS Social behavior comprises the interactions occurring between two or more conspecifics. In an encounter, one animal approaches; the other either remains passive, or responds in some way so that one or a sequence of interactions occurs. For convenience, I have classified the social behavior patterns and interactions as agonistic, sexual, and contactual. In the following account I some- times use the term "friendly" in spite of its possible anthropomorphic implications, to refer to relationships which are either contactual, or sexual and contactual, in nature.</page><page sequence="19">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 433 Agonistic interactions ordinarily involve a retreat by one of the participants and are common in male-male and female-female en- counters. They are also common between females and juveniles. The distinction between sexual and contactual patterns is somewhat arbi- trary since all involve bodily contact. Two sexual patterns, the naso- anal and chin-rump, follow, commonly involve juveniles or females not in estrus, and patterns classed as contactual frequently occur in sexual situations. Patterns classed as sexual have only been seen in male-female or male-juvenile encounters and are initiated by the male. Contactual patterns occur between any two friendly animals regardless of age or sex. One common interaction, following, cannot be included in the above classification. Following occurs in a variety of contexts.

AGONISTIC PATTERNS Approach-Retreat. -A subordinate Microcavia usually retreats when a dominant approaches. Less frequently a subordinate may cautiously approach a dominant, stop in attend, and quickly retreat, without drawing an attack. Head thrust.-A forward jab of the head or a quick turn of the head and foreparts toward another animal. The head thrust represents an intention of biting, and is commonly given by females to juveniles to discourage approach or nursing. Attack-lunge.-The attacking animal rapidly runs or jumps at its opponent which usually hastily retreats; the flight of the subordinate animal terminates the encounter. Chase.-An approach-retreat or attack-lunge frequently results in a chase. In a high intensity chase the attacking animal attempts to catch and bite his opponent. The fleeing animal may make a soft twitter. A low intensity chase may involve a series of approach- retreats in which the dominant animal stops in attend each time the subordinate stops. The chase was the commonest form of aggression observed at La Cristina. In all forms of agonistic interactions, contact with biting was rel- atively rare, and these patterns appear to fulfill their function of spacing out the population and maintaining dominance relationships without causing physical injury. An exception is the mating chase on an estrous female in which males in proximity to the female frequently roll on the ground biting at each other. Submissive Crouch.-A subordinate animal frequently crouches, belly to ground, at the approach of a dominant. This appears to inhibit aggression. SEXUAL PATTERNS Naso-anal.-The male lowers and turns his head to sniff, lick or nuzzle the ano-genital region of a female or juvenile. The naso-anal probably functions in acquainting the male with the female's identity and reproductive condition. Chin-rump follow.-The male approaches a female or juvenile, nibbles or nuzzles it on the rump, presses his chin against the rump and follows in this position. Frequently the pair moves in circles or a figure-eight pattern. The male often seems highly excited during the chin-rump follow. If his partner pauses, he may make rapid paw pats against its rump, or he may naso-anal sniff or lick and then attempt to push up the rump with his nose. In a fast chin-rump follow, the male may fall behind and then run to re-establish contact. The recipient occasionally makes a soft twittering during the chin- rump follow which probably represents mild annoyance or fear. A juvenile typically moves in a slow walk during the chin-rump follow and shows no aggression to the male. Occasionally it may</page><page sequence="21">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 435 speed up in an apparent attempt to avoid the male and the chin- rump follow may then resemble a chase. In a chin-rump follow on an adult female the animals often move in a series of starts and stops and the female may jump around aggressively to face the male (fac- ing). When facing occurs, the male may move around to the rear of the female and press his chin to her rump, the female may then face and the sequence may be repeated again and again with the animals rotating in a tight circle. The chin-rump follow may continue for five or more minutes and frequently terminates with the animals sitting together. Sometimes it may be broken up by another animal. A more dominant male may attack and chase the male from the female, or a female may chase the female from the male. The frequency of observed chin-rump fol- lows on juveniles and females in different reproductive states is shown in Table 7. This pattern is commonest in male-juvenile contacts, occurring in over half the observed encounters. Males also commonly chin-rump follow nonbreeding females, particularly as they approach TABLE 7 -Frequency of chin-rump follows by adult males Recipient bio Ct 0 0~~~ 1966 April Encounters .. ... .... .... 5 5 Chin-rump follows . . . ..

This was most frequently observed in July near the commence- ment of the mating season, while most chin-rump follows on one- three-month-old females were observed in December when many young animals were present on the study area. Although males frequently associate with pregnant or lactating females, they rarely chin-rump follow them. The three occasions on which males were observed in the chin-rump follow on lactating females occurred when the males were sexually excited by a nearby female in estrus. The chin-rump follow on an estrous female is typically a preliminary to copulation. Mount.-The male grasps the female with his front legs and mounts from the rear with his venter pressed against the female's rump,. Mount- ing is accompanied by rapid pelvic thrusts. If the male gains intro- mission, the speed of thrusting is slowed to about one/sec. After four or five intromissions the male ejaculates, or the female may pull away. Mounting and the subsequent copulatory behavior are more fully described under Mating Behavior. CONTACTUAL PATTERN S Sitting Together.- Animals often sit in contact with each other. Sitting together was the commonest pattern recorded in all except male-male encounters. The animals frequently sit side by side but variations are common. In rear-sit, one animal sits upright with its venter against the rump of the other. In side-sit the upright animal has its venter in contact with the side of its partner. In both postures the upright animal may pull its front feet in to its chest or may place them on the other animal. Other variations are head-over-rear (one animal sits with its chin on the rump of the other), and head-over- side (as head-over-rear but with the chin over the side of the partner). Microcavia sitting together may frequently change position. For example, when two animals sit side by side one frequently adjusts its position to sit in side- or rear-sit on its partner. If the partner moves away, it may be left resting in an upright posture. Several animals may sit together. These groups may include several females or juveniles but ordinarily only one adult male. Kiss.-When two friendly animals meet, they frequently touch noses and then nuzzle each other about the mouth. A short kiss may involve nothing more than a brief naso-nasal contact, but more often the kiss is prolonged for periods up to a minute. It functions as a general greeting and recognition pattern between friendly animals and is frequently a prelude to other interactions, usually of a con- tactual or sexual nature. Occasionally it may be followed by aggres- sion. Both animals may participate in the kiss or one may kiss the other. When a dominance relationship exists the animal initiating the kiss is usually the subordinate. In such cases the kiss seems to signify a friendly intent. The dominant animal usually returns the kiss and the two sit together, but occasionally the dominant may attack the subordinate.</page><page sequence="23">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 437 Nose.-In the nose, the actor touches (or sniffs) the recipient on the head, back, sides, or rump, with the nose. The nose is principally a male act employed in interactions with females and juveniles and, like the kiss, functions in individual recognition. A male searching for an estrous female approaches every animal it encounters, noses it briefly as if checking its identity, and runs on. Nibbling. An animal may approach and groom another with the incisors, on the head or body, or it may begin to nibble its partner as they sit together. Nibbling is not solicited and is usually ignored by the recipient. Occasionally it may respond by moving away or by nibbling the previous groomer. It frequently occurs in sexual contexts. A male typically nibbles the rump of a female or juvenile as a prelude to, or during, the chin-rump follow. In these cases the nibbling has a "frenzied" appearance and is frequently accompanied by paw pats. Lactating females groom juveniles by nibbling. Climb-over.-Juveniles frequently attempt to climb on or over the backs of adults, and less frequently of other juveniles. They jump against the side of the adult and may succeed in climbing on its back where they may sit for several minutes before sliding off. Attempted Nursing.-Juveniles may nuzzle under any adult (in- cluding males and nonlactating females), apparently attempting to nurse. The adult often responds by moving away; females may make a head thrust. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADULT MALES Male-male encounters are almost always aggressive. Chase and approach-retreat are the commonest interactions. In 131 agonistic encounters, 70 involved a chase, while 40 involved the retreat of one male without aggression by the other. Agonistic interactions are or- ganized by a straight-line dominance hierarchy. Males appear to individually recognize other males within their home range and re- spond according to their position in the hierarchy. Only two recorded interactions involved reversal of known dominance relationships and these probably resulted from a temporary failure of identification. Dominance relationships were stable throughout the study. M46 was dominant in all encounters (22 recorded) from April-December, 1966. In July M76 and M315 were both dominant to M35 and M32. M76 and M315 were not seen after July, however, and in September M35 was dominant to M32 and both were dominant to previously unmarked males, M98 and M99. By February 1967 both M46 and M35 had disappeared from the study area and the previously number- three male in the hierarchy, M32, was the dominant male. Most encounters between males were observed when they gathered in the vicinity of a pregnant female. Although the number of ag- gressive encounters increases due to the concentration of males in a small area, the intensity of aggression does not do so until the mating chase. Males will often sit in attend postures within 15 cm of each other with their attention concentrated on the female's home bush, while waiting for her to give birth. Although males are attracted to</page><page sequence="24">438 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) lactating females and juveniles, they do not congregate around them. When encounters do occur, the dominant male chases the subordinate from the bush. For example, M154 was chin-rump following a juvenile when it approached and kissed M158. M154 immediately attacked and chased M158. Other aggressive interactions between males occurred when one male approached another sitting together with a female or juvenile. Although these encounters around a female's bush give the impression that the male is defending an area (or the females and juveniles within it), I found no evidence of dominance reversal in different areas. The dominance hierarchy, rather than territoriality, appears to be the important regulating factor in male-male relation- ships. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FEMALES Interactions between females are more variable than those between males. Females develop individual relationships with the other females within their home range which may be either hostile or friendly. Of the 92 female-female encounters observed in the study, 56 were agonistic and 36 were amicable in nature. The principal factors which affect interactions between females are: the age and reproductive condition of the animals, their kinship relationship, and the proximity of the encounter to the home bush of one or the other. Some ag- gressive interactions appear to be stimulated by the activities of a male. For example, in July, I twice watched a female attack and chase another female which was being chin-rump followed by a male. The attacker each time returned to the male which did a chin-rump fol- low on her. Ordinarily each adult female occupies one or a small group of bushes and rarely meets other females. When adult females do come into contact, the encounters may be friendly involving kissing and sitting together. I suspect that most friendly relationships occur be- tween siblings or mother-daughter pairs. Adult females are often hostile to adolescents, especially if these approach the home bush of the adult. Of the nine agonistic encounters recorded between marked females occupying different bushes, seven were aggressions of adult females on adolescents and five occurred when the adolescent wandered near the home bush of the adult. The majority of observed encounters were between females in- habiting the same bush. In September-October 1967, three lactating females occupied a single bush in a strip of thornbush scrub one kilometer from the main study area. Relations between F164 and F159 were ordinarily amicable and dominance was only seen twice when F159 approached and F164 repulsed her with a head thrust. Typically one would approach and they would kiss and sit together. Although either female might sit with F150, they also sometimes chased her. F150 frequently seemed uneasy in their presence and tended to move away when they approached. Frequently F159 would approach, would move away. In six of 10 recorded friendly encounters, F150 F150 would kiss her, and they would sit together briefly; then F150</page><page sequence="25">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 439 groomed by nibbling, stretched, yawned or rolled as she moved away. Such apparently irrelevant comfort movements suggest that these may fit the concept of displacement activities (i.e., irrelevant activities occurring in conflict situations). Relations between a female and her offspring are ordinarily friendly until she gives birth to a new litter, but after the birth the relationship changes abruptly. For example, in December F69 shared the same home bush with her daughter of the previous litter, F137, and had frequent contactual interactions with her until F69 gave birth to three juveniles. She then became very aggressive to F137 and attacked and chased her whenever they met. At first F137 retreated and crouched submissively, belly to ground, but she was bitten and chased. When F137 later ap- proached, she was chased around two bushes and approximately 20 m out from the home bush. In spite of this rough treatment the young female returned after each chase. After five such encounters she avoided F69 and retreated quickly when she approached. Two days later encounters between the two females were still mainly agonistic, but F69 was less aggressive and sometimes tolerated F137 within 15 cm of her while she nursed. Although male-female relations are nearly always friendly, F69 chased a young unmarked male which approached her bush and later did a head thrust and attack-lunge on M38 when he approached and attempted to sit with her. F137 frequently associated with the juveniles when F69 was away from the bush but retreated when F69 returned to nurse. Unfortu- nately, F69 had her leg bitten off by a grison when in a trap and sub- sequently deserted the area, so I was unable to follow the interesting mother-daughter relationship further. I observed an apparently similar relationship for a few days in September 1966, although in this case I was not sure of the parentage. A young female, possibly a daughter, frequently associated with F75 and her juveniles. While F75 was away from the bush, the young female spent most of her time in friendly activity with the juveniles but she retreated about a meter and crouched whenever F75 approached the bush to nurse. MALE-FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS Relations between adult males and females are friendly, with few exceptions, and involve sexual or contactual interactions. Of the 232 encounters recorded, only four were agonistic. A total of 102 sexual and 272 contactual interactions were recorded between males and females. Ordinarily, sexual encounters also include contactual inter- actions such as sitting together, kissing, nibbling and nosing. Contacts are usually initiated by a male. After the recognition kiss the animals may sit together side by side or with the male in side- or rear-sit on the female. In 136 recorded sitting positions, the animals sat side by side in 68 and the male sat in rear-sit on the female in 58. The female was recorded in side- or rear-sit on the male on only 10 occasions. If the female is approaching estrus, the male typically moves behind her and begins the chin-rump follow. Frequently the two Microcavia forage together.</page><page sequence="26">440 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) Male relations with adolescent and nonbreeding adult females are ordinarily brief and transitory in nature, and a typical encounter lasts only a few minutes. However, one male did have a more per- manent association with an adolescent female which extended for at least a week in 1966. Between 11 and 18 December, M38 spent most of his time with F138 (approximately five weeks in age) and 18 en- counters were recorded. In contrast M38 was observed to have only three other encounters with one other female, and F138 had only four other encounters with three different males. Although I had originally thought that the association might be due to F 138's sexual attrac- tiveness as she neared estrus, it continued after she came into estrus and mated with several males on 12 December. Males may form temporary associations with breeding females and spend several hours each day with a lactating female and her juveniles. The juveniles may be an important factor since they have a con- siderable sexual attraction for males. Temporary associations also de- velop between males and pregnant females. A few days before parturi- tion, if no other female in the area is in or near estrus, males begin to congregate near the home bush of the pregnant female. Each male attempts to approach and interact with the female at every oppor- tunity. Encounters frequently involve sitting together, kissing, naso- anals and following by the male but he does not attempt to chin-rump follow the female. Since subordinates retreat from the female when a dominant male approaches, the top male in the hierarchy tends to monopolize her. For example, six males associated with F75 in the two days before she gave birth, but 10 of the 20 recorded encounters were with dominant M32. When the female is in the bush, particularly on the day of parturition, the males sit quietly about in attends. Associations of several males with a pregnant female occur most frequently in late spring and summer. In September and October the peak season of births - males are distracted by so many estrous females that they are less likely to congregate about a pregnant female. MATING BEHAVIOR Parturition usually occurs in the female's home bush in the morn- ing. For approximately thirty minutes, following the birth, the female remains with her juveniles. She licks and nuzzles them nearly con- stantly and eats the afterbirth. During this period the males ordinarily remain outside the bush sitting in static attend postures. When the juveniles are dry the female runs from the bush. This stimulates the males to action and the mating chase begins. As many as six males chase after the female attempting to mount, creating considerable con- fusion. There is much aggression among the males involving chasing and rolling about and biting on the ground. On one occasion the female abruptly stopped and the chasing males piled up, on top of her in a frantically squirming heap. In the confusion of the chase and male-male aggression, the males commonly become separated from the female, and race from bush to</page><page sequence="27">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 441 bush with their noses close to the ground tracking her by scent. I could always easily tell when an estrous female was in the vicinity by the great activity of the males. They appear oblivious to most external stimuli and will run within half a meter of an observer. The female remains away from her juveniles for about five hours after parturition and may mate with several males in this period. However, most of her time is spent in hiding from the males in holes and bushes. Occasionally she may climbl a bush to escape their at- tentions. The only successful matings seem to occur when a single male happens to encounter the female, since the confusion of the mating chase prevents successful copulation. Typically the male fol- lows the female in chin-rump follow. She stops and he mounts making rapid pelvic thrusts. As the male achieves intromission the female usually lowers her foreparts to the ground keeping her hindquarters raised. After 4-5 intromissions she pulls away, does a perineal drag and may roll. The male sits. behind her for a few seconds, then beginis the chin-rump follow and the sequence is repeated. After four or five mounting sequences the male may ejaculate (a prolonged pelvic thrust on the final intromission accompanied by a drawing in of the flanks). The male then sits over the female for several seconds but does not begin the chin-rump follow when she pulls away. In the course of a mating sequence, another male frequently approaches and the original male attempts to chase it away. The female may escape in the process, or the resulting confusion may attract other males and the mating chase begins. While the female is away from her home bush, the juveniles can frequently be seen sitting by it. They resemble miniature adults and exhibit many adult behavior patterns. They may groom by nibbling, scratching or face wipes; roll; climb; or nibble at vegetation. Males in search of the estrous female frequently run past the juveniles, ignoring them or perhaps nosing them briefly in passing. The juveniles may attempt to follow the males but do not ordinarily move far from the home bush. When they are about five hours old their mother returns and they have their first extended nursing period. By now the males appear to have lost interest in the female. Numerous variations from this basic pattern of postpartum mating events may occur. The start of the mating chase may differ, depending upon factors such as where the parturition takes place, how many males are in attendance, and whether or not the males see the female emerge from her bush. For example, on 16 December 1966 pregnant F69 was observed entering her home bush at 9:13 AM. At 10:25 AM she ran from the bush apparently unobserved by the five attending males. Almost immediately the males seemed to detect her absence and began to run about the bush and then to adjacent bushes sniffing the ground. However, a male did not succeed in locating her until 30 minutes later when she emerged from a nearby bush to forage. M35, the number-two male in the hierarchy, then approached, naso-anal sniffed the female, and commenced the chin-rump follow. Sexual interactions with F145 commenced even before her juveniles</page><page sequence="28">442 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) were dry, probably because the parturition occurred at the entrance to a bush where she was readily accessible to the males. This female was found at 10:15 AM licking her newborn, still-wet juveniles with three males sitting around her in attends. Extracts from my field notes for 19 December 1966 document the events leading to the start of the mating chase. 10:25 AM - F145 sits eating afterbirth. M35 (the dominant male since M46 is not present) approaches and excitedly noses a juvenile. He ap- proaches the female and does short chin-rump follow, nibbling her rump. Unmarked male approaches and M35 chases it. 10:30 AM - M35 approaches and begins chin-rump follow, nibbling at the female's rump. They sit together and the female eats afterbirth. M35 moves away. M32 approaches and mounts female, frantically nibbling at her back and patting her with his front feet. M98 approaches and sits near. 10:35 AM - M35 nibbles F145 on her venter and naso-anal licks her. He circles female, nibbling at her back but she does not get up. M35 moves away. 10:40 AM- Chin-rump follow by unmarked male in circle. M35 ap- proaches and attack-lunge-chase on unmarked male. M101 approaches, kisses female, moves away. M98 approaches, sniffs female, she moves away. M35 chin-rump follow in circles, nibbles female's genitals, sit together. M35 moves away. 10:45 AM - Female moves out from bush. M35 chases her, then M35 chases M32 who chases female. Mating chase has commenced. In attempting to escape from the males during a mating chase a female may temporarily leave her home range. For example, F137, in her first estrus, took temporary refuge in an abandoned vizcacha hole in the Stipa grass area ordinarily avoided by all Microcavia. One male chased two others from the vicinity of the hole for several minutes and then entered; F137 emerged, and raced back to her home bush with the three males in pursuit. ADULT MALE-JUVENILE RELATIONS HIPS In many respects male-juvenile interactions resemble those between males and females. Encounters involve sexual or contactual patterns (usually both). Of the 119 encounters recorded, only one involved possible aggression. All sexual and contactual patterns occurring in male-female interactions are also found in male-juvenile interactions with the exception of the mount. When a male approaches the home bush of a lactating female, several juveniles may run to him, jump playfully against his side or climb over his back. Juveniles less than a week old may nuzzle under the belly of the male attempting to nurse but older juveniles only attempt nursing from lactating females. Males frequently sit with juveniles and with a lactating female while she nurses. Frequently a male will sit briefly with a juvenile, then begin to nibble its rump and commence the chin-rump follow. The chin-rump follow was the com- monest interaction recorded in male-juvenile encounters.</page><page sequence="29">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 443 Often a male appears to search for an individual juvenile. He may sniff and move away from several others, including littermates, until the selected individual is found. The juvenile is as likely to be a male as a female. Of the 48 chin-rump follows in which the sex of the juvenile was known, 28 involved males, and 20 involved females. Juveniles from one to three weeks old are preferred. In September- October 1967, observations were made for a two-week period on three litters which occupied the same bush. Juveniles under a week old were not chin-rump followed. M154, the most frequent male visitor, often sought and chin-rump followed JuvM153. For example, M154 was observed to chin-rump follow JuvM153 (13 days in age) a total of 15 times while ignoring other juveniles present including his brother. Later the same day an unmarked male did eight chin-rump follows on JuvF149, age 15 days, but he sniffed and then ignored the other juveniles including M153. However, males do not invariably restrict their attentions to a specific individual; a male may occasionally chin- rump follow two juveniles in succession. FEMALE-JUVENILE RELATIONSHIPS RELATIONS WITH THE MOTHER During its first week, the juvenile ordinarily spends most of its day in the vicinity of tne home bush, although one did independently rnove a distance of 50 m between bushes when only three days old. When the mother approaches, her juveniles run to her and suckle. Nursing usually occurs in the bare area surrounding the bush, often near an entrance. Typically the female sits with the front legs extended. The juveniles usually suckle from the side but may also be between the front legs which the female sometimes supports on the juveniles' backs. Occasionally a female may lie on her venter or side while she nurses. Juveniles sometimes change mammae during suckling. Although only four can be accommodated at one time as many as six may nuzzle under the female attempting to suckle. Occasionally the female leans over to lick and nuzzle the ano-genital region of a juvenile, probably thereby stimulating elimination. The juvenile lifts its rear while being licked and may turn on its side. Sometimes it suckles with its perineal region elevated. Juveniles in their first week suckle approximately once each half hour throughout the day. For example, F69 nursed her juveniles 11 times from 3:15 PM-9:30 PM on their day of birth, and 10 times, from 4:45-9:10 PM when they were three days old. The mean duration of 25 nursing periods was 5 min 54 sec (range 20 sec-23 min). Nursing usually terminates with the female moving away. The juveniles often follow and attempt to suckle again, but the female ordinarily prevents them from doing so by swiveling her hindquarters to the side and keeping her venter pressed against the ground. If a juvenile persists, it may be repulsed with a head thrust. Attempted suckling often ends with the juvenile sitting beside its mother. Often it jumps against her side and may climb on or over her. When the female leaves the bush,</page><page sequence="30">444 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) the juveniles may follow a short distance but they usually then return. When they are about a week old, they begin to follow the female to neighboring bushes. By this time they probably receive the bulk of their nourishment from solid foods and are capable of living independ- ently, but they may continue to suckle for one to two weeks more. RELATIONS WITH OTHER FEMALES When two or more females inhabit the same bush, they may nurse each other's juveniles. A young juvenile ordinarily runs to any adult which approaches and attempts suckling. When its mother ceases to provide sufficient milk, it may "adopt" a more recently lactating female for suckling purposes. For example, in October 1967 JuvM153 persistently associated with Juveniles 162 and 163 (11 days younger) and nursed from their mother, F159. The recorded interactions of F159 with the six juveniles from three litters inhabiting her bush are shown in Table 8, from 4 October (the date of her parturition) until 11 October. On 4 October, M153 and M157 were 11 days old, and F149 and F156 were estimated to be about two weeks old from their total lengths and weights. All these juveniles were observed suckling from F159 at least once but M153 was the only one which persistently did so. On one occasion F159 was seen nursing four juveniles from the three different litters simultaneously. Although it originally seemed that nursing occurs at random, with any lactating female nursing any juvenile, it soon became clear that a female reacts differently to her own juveniles than to those of others, being more aggressive to young which are not her own. Thus F159 responded aggressively to other juveniles 17 times in 57 encounters (Table 8) whereas she was never aggressive to her own juveniles. The other two adult females inhabiting the bush, while ordinarily friendly to the juveniles of F159, were occasionally aggressive to them. Experi- mental manipulation would be necessary to determine the extent to which females are able to discriminate between individual juveniles and the factors-e.g., size, odor, etc.-involved. Habituation may be TABLE 8.-Interactions of lactating F159 with juveniles-4-11 October 1967 juveniles of other females Juveniles of F159 M153 F149 F156 M157 TOTAL (F162 and M163) Encounters 38 8 3 8 57 104 Aggression Head thrust 7 1 0 1 9 0 Attack-lunge 1 0 2 0 3 0 Chase 2 0 0 3 5 0 TOTAL 10 1 2 4 17 0 Nursing 20 4 1 2 27 85 Attempted nursing 5 2 0 2 9 5 Nasal-anal licking 1 0 0 0 1 9 by female Contactual 10 1 0 0 1 1 17 (Sit together, nibble, kiss, climb over)</page><page sequence="31">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 445 important in determining a female's reaction. F159 was more tolerant of M153 who consistently associated with her and her juveniles, than of his brother M157. JUVENILE-JUVENILE RELATIONS Interactions between juveniles are typically amicable. When not with adults, young Microcavia spend much of their time sitting in contact with their littermates or young of other litters. Older juveniles sometimes move about between bushes temporarily associating with other litters. Climbing over, nibbling, and kissing are common inter- actions. Movements of young animals tend to be quicker and more jerky than those of adults, and juveniles sometimes dash about in "play" chasing each other back and forth or making frisky hops. SYNTHESIS OF LIFE HISTORY AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT Before discussing the results of the study I will attempt to bring together the principal findings on Microcavia behavior by describing the hypothetical behavioral development of a "typical" male and female. The newborn Microcavia finds itself in a protective environment. Besides its mother, the juvenile has friendly contacts with other female and juvenile inhabitants of the bush and with adult males which ap- proach in search of the estrous female. The juvenile often approaches adult animals and nuzzles under their bellies in an attempt to suckle. When the adult moves away, the newborn Microcavia follows it a short distance. If it happens to encounter a lactating female, it may suc- cessfully suckle. While its mother is in postpartum estrus, the juvenile stays near its natal bush in company with its siblings. It has its first extended suck- ling period when she returns about five hours after the birth, and thereafter it runs to its mother whenever she approaches and she nurses it frequently. When she leaves the bush, the juvenile may follow a short distance, but soon returns to the home bush. During its first week the juvenile is constantly in proximity to other juveniles and adults. Physical contact is sought and it frequently rubs its chin against other animals and jumps against their sides or over their backs. It nibbles at leaves, grass and forbs and explores the area about the bush in company with its siblings. It keeps itself clean by grooming and rolling frequently. By the time it is a week old, the juvenile is exploring a wider area and occasionally follows its mother from its home bush. It keeps directly behind and close to her and thus moves in stops and starts with a final dash to a nearby bush. Suckling attempts on unrelated lactating females may be rejected with a head thrust, or an occasional short pursuit by the female. The juvenile is never injured and may immediately return and sit with the pursuing female. Males begin to respond sexually to the week-old juvenile by nibbling at its rump and</page><page sequence="32">446 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) chin-rump following at intervals throughout the day, sometimes for several minutes at a time. At about two weeks of age, the juvenile may find that its mother no longer provides it with sufficient milk and suckling attempts are thwarted by the mother moving about and swivelling her rear to the side. This weaning by the mother may induce the juvenile to adopt a more recently lactating female, with whom it spends most of its time, along with her juveniles. Attention to the foster female does not prevent the juvenile from following and sitting with its natural mother. By the time it is three weeks old, many encounters with adult females are agonistic. The juvenile may still atteinpt suckling, but is likely to be rejected by a head thrust or attack-lunge. At one month, encounters with adult males are still frequent. These often involve a chin-rump follow but, with the young males, this pattern may escalate into a chase of the younger animal. The month-old Microcavia usually resides in its natal bush and sometimes feeds and sits with its mother. Other females in the bush, however, may harass the juvenile into departing and it may attempt to establish itself elsewhere. The fate of the adolescent Microcavia probably depends to a con- siderable extent on the population density. If this is high, it may be driven from its home bush and exposed to a greater risk of mortality. However, if only one adult female occupies the home bush, the adolescent female may be able to maintain an amicable relationship with her, at least until the birth of the next litter. Adult males frequently kiss, chin-rump follow and sit together with the adolescent female. Between one and two months of age she comes into her first estrus and mates with several males. At this time she may be chased out of her usual home range as she attempts to escape and hide from the pursuing males. In the course of her daily activity, the young female may wander near the home bush of a neighboring adult female and be attacked and chased. After several such encounters she avoids the areas where she may be attacked and confines her activities to the immediate area near her home bush. The adolescent female's relationship with her mother changes abruptly after the birth of the next litter. The lactat- ing female becomes very aggressive to her daughter, frequently attack- ing and chasing her out from the bush. Although a young female may be driven out at this time, she may return to the home bush after each attack until she is eventually tolerated. She associates with the new juveniles but retreats when her mother approaches to nurse them. If she has conceived at her first estrus, the female may bear her first litter between three and four months in age. She may continue her amicable relationship with her mother, and the two females may nurse each other's juveniles. Mortality is high in Microcavia, and the young female has a good chance of becoming the sole resident of the bush through the death of her mother. Males frequently visit the female at her bush and she may have friendly encounters with several in the same day. While she is pregnant, they will not chin-rump follow</page><page sequence="33">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 447 her, but they frequently kiss and sit with her. Since the female ordi- narily stays in the immediate vicinity of her bush, her home range is less than 0.5 hectare. She rarely contacts other females and strange females wandering near her bush are chased away. Adult females with which she has previously associated, e.g., a sibling, daughter, etc., may be kissed and briefly sat with. Few observations on adolescent males were made at La Cristina, but in outdoor pens, a young male leads a harassed life since both adult males and females are hostile to him. The adolescent male may be driven from his home bush earlier than his sisters by the attacks of both adult males and females. If not actually driven out he may leave voluntarily, perhaps in search of juveniles which he has already begun to chin-rump follow. Mortality may well be high in this period. By the time the male is three months old he is sexually mature and has begun to establish amicable relations with adult females. However, he is often chased from the vicinity of females by older males to which he is subordinate. When he visits a bush occupied by an adult female, he sniffs the rolling site, and may be stimulated to roll, urinate and mark with the adanal glands. Olfactory stimuli at the rolling site presumably give him information about the identities of other animals in the vicinity and the estrous condition of the females. The male is particularly attracted by a female in the late stages of pregnancy; if there are no other females near estrus within his home range, he may spend most of his day near her home bush. Although frequently chased by older males, he continues to return and attempts to associate with the pregnant female. During parturition, his attention is riveted on the bush and he may sit within 15 cm of another male without aggression. When the estrous female leaves the bush after parturition, he chases and attempts to mount regardless of attacks and biting by older males. When near the female he is so highly aroused that he may even attack a more dominant male. Usually the male quickly loses the female and runs from bush to bush, nose to ground, attempting to track her by scent. Apparently oblivious to all stimuli except those provided by the female, he is now particularly vulnerable to predation. If he is very lucky, he may locate the female away from other males and copulate successfully. In his frequent encounters with other males, especially in the vicinity of females, he reacts according to his previous experience with a given male. Although he usually quickly retreats at the approach of a dominant, he may linger until chased. His dominance status rises with age, because of the deaths of males above him in the hierarchy. DISCUSSION What adaptive values have brought about the evolution of this type of social behavior and organization in Microcavia? What selection pressures h-ave molded the various behavior patterns? Many behavior patterns may be specific adaptions to the type of habitat occupied, and comparisons with ecological equivalents may reveal convergences in</page><page sequence="34">448 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) behavior as a result of adaptation to a similar environment. Phylo- genetic relationships to other Caviinae may reveal ancestral homo- logues of the behavior. Comparisons with other members of the Caviinae are presently in progress and will not be discussed here. Although the adaptive values of some patterns seem obvious to the field observer, this is not always the case and some may even appear maladaptive, e.g., they may appear to attract predators without giving the animal any apparent compensating benefit. Apparently maladap- tive traits could result from pleitropic gene effects or they might represent former adaptations of the ancestral form to a different en- vironment. The latter possibility raises questions of environmental change and the behavior of ancestral forms of which we usually have no knowledge. Unfortunately, behavior does not fossilize and time machines exist only in fiction and the imagination. Many patterns are adaptations which help to protect Microcavia from predators in an open environment. The keen eyesight, acute hearing and upright attend posture all aid in predator detection and the Microcavia is alert to the behavior of other cavies around it and responds to their attend postures and alarm calls. Cavies also respond to the alarm calls of birds, and thus are frequently aware of the presence of a predator while it is out of view. When a Microcavia moves out from a bush it does so cautiously, stopping in attend several times. Such behavior prepares it for a quick dash back to the bush if a possible predator is detected. When foraging in the open it is also alert and frequently lifts its head to look about. Cavies never rest in the open, but always near their bushes. In anthropomorphic terms, we can say that they have a sense of security when sitting by a bush, and they will often let a predator approach to within a few meters. The bare area surrounding an occupied bush-kept clear of vegetation by the activities of the animals-may aid in the visual detection of predators. And since their coat color matches the color of the soil around the bush, a stationary Microcavia is well camouflaged. Males are more vulnerable to predators than females because of their mating activities and larger home ranges. Males are most subject to predation when searching for or congregating about an estrous female. A predator, perhaps attracted by the commotion of the mating chase, would be more likely to catch one of the attending males than the less expendable female who spends most of her time in cover. At La Cristina, the percentage of males lost from the population was slightly higher than the female percentage loss in all except the July- September 1966 period (Table 3). Climbing and digging are behavioral adaptations promoting sur- vival in a semiarid environment. These two patterns are considerably better developed in the northern form (M. a. salinia) which inhabits desert areas, where ground vegetation is frequently absent. In desert habitats climbing takes on a high adaptive value since leaves and fruits of trees and shrubs such as Larrea and Prosopis provide the principal food. Digging to provide a protected homesite is also a necessity. A</page><page sequence="35">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 449 comparative study of these two subspecies would be of great interest in revealing the effects of different environments on behavior. Microcavia social organization is adaptive in promoting individual survival and reproduction and in regulating population density. Ag- gression is the principal intraspecific force tending to reduce density by promoting dispersal. Young Microcavia first encounter aggression from adult females. When several females occupy the same home bush, the young animals may be driven out sooner; and if they are unable to quickly find an unoccupied bush as a home base, their probability of survival is low. Young females born near the periphery of the range of distribution of the population may be chiefly responsible for range extension. In the course of their early wanderings, they encounter unoccupied bushes which become their home base if they are later ejected by adult females. Adolescent females born near the center of the local population may be completely surrounded by bushes already occupied by resident females, and thus may be unable to establish themselves. They may be forced to return again and again to their home bush in spite of repeated attacks from the resident females. Aggression is directed principally at individuals of like sex and thus performs its functions of spacing and dispersal without interfering with mating activities. The male dominance hierarchy orders the society and prevents destructive fighting. Since mortality is high, the in- dividual males in the hierarchy are constantly changing, but overt fighting to improve dominance position appears to be rare. When the alpha male dies, the second male in the hierarchy assumes dominance unchallenged. Amicable male-female relationships help assure successful reproduc- tion. Males are familiar with all females within their home ranges through frequent friendly contacts; their attraction to and attendance around females near parturition help assure successful mating at the postpartum estrus. Since females are friendly to all adult males and appear to mate indiscriminately with any of them, the high male mortality rate does not upset male-female relationships. In species which form a pair bond or in which females select individual males, loss of a member of the pair might prevent successful reproduction. Adult males establish an amicable and sexual relationship with young females helping to insure successful mating at first estrus. Males frequently chin-rump follow juveniles; the pattern may serve to stimulate young females and be instrumental in inducing a proestrous condition. However, males less than three weeks old are chin-rump followed with approximately equal frequency suggesting that adult males are unable to distinguish the sex of younger juveniles. The chin-rump follow on juvenile males has no apparent function and indeed appears maladaptive to a species inhabiting an open environ- ment; it is conspicuous, of relatively long duration, and absorbs the attention of the two animals rendering them less able to detect predator approach. In some instances Microcavia cooperate with one another. In</page><page sequence="36">450 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 83(2) severe weather they may huddle together thereby conserving body heat, and they may mutually groom. Cavies derive protection by responding to the alarm calls of conspecifics, and when more than one female inhabit the same bush, they commonly nurse each other's young. The survival value of indiscriminate nursing is, however, open to question. It is undoubtedly advantageous for a juvenile to suckle from more than one female since a greater milk intake will increase its growth rate. In addition, a newborn juvenile whose mother is killed, e.g., while engaged in the highly conspicuous mating chase which may be likely to attract predators, may save its life by suckling from a foster mother. On the other hand, juveniles weaned by their mother may adopt a newly lactating female and thus tend to deprive her younger offspring of their quota of milk. One might expect that aggressive females which protect their milk supply for their own young by rejecting strange juveniles would be selected for. Lactating females are more aggressive to juveniles of other females than to their own. Perhaps any tendency for aggressive females to be selected for is balanced by the selective advantages to the species of random nursing. This suggests group selection, at present a controversial theory. Many bird and mammal species make use of Microcavia runways and burrows, but the presence of an ecologically similar relative, Galea musteloides, is of particular interest. According to Gause's principle of competitive exclusion, we expect sympatric, closely related species to occupy different ecological niches. When two similar species at first sight appear to occupy the same niche, further detailed study often reveals behavioral differences which serve to lessen competition. For example, Carleton (1966) found that, although two sympatric sciurids, Eutamias minimus, and Citellus lateralis, fed mainly upon dandelions, the chipmunk consumed mainly the flowers and seed heads while the mantled squirrel preferred the stems. This difference in behavior effectively limited competition between the two species. While many examples of the competitive exclusion principle can be noted, it cannot be disproved because even the most detailed field studies may fail to reveal slight differences in behavior which might lessen competition between two species. And of course even the most ecologically similar species will differ in some behavioral elements and the effect of these behavioral differences on the ecological roles of the species may be impossible to determine. Several factors may lessen competition between Microcavia and Galea. They may differ in food habits, since Galea was never observed feeding upon the leaves of the thornbushes which form an important part of the Microcavia diet. Since Galea and Microcavia have ami- cable interactions, use the same bushes as shelter, and do not respond sexually to each other, a limited food supply would seem to be the principal basis for competition. But there appeared to be an abundant food supply at La Cristina throughout the study period. Each popula- tion may be regulated by homeostatic mechanisms which keep the num- ber of individuals below that which would exhaust available resources.</page><page sequence="37">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 451 Furthermore, one or both may derive some benefit from the presence of the other. Huddling together in cold weather helps to conserve body heat, and attend postures and the Microcavia alarm call warn of the presence of predators. The holes dug by Microcavia may provide Galea, a nondigger, with a handy refuge. In outdoor pens Galea sleeps in holes dug by Microcavia in preference to nest boxes. Galea is less abundant than Microcavia in the semiarid open habitats where sympatry has been observed and may be less well adapted to this type of environment. Galea lacks an alarm call and rarely gives the upright attend. Its smaller eye suggests that the vision is less acute, and its darker color renders it more conspicuous when sitting on the bare areas surrounding bushes. And the conspicuous threat behavior common in Galea interactions makes the individuals involved more conspicuous to predators in an open habitat. Possibly the abundance of Microcavia on the study area had an adverse effect on Galea reproduction. In a large outdoor pen, Micro- cavia attacked and killed three newborn Cavia which wandered in- advertently through the wire partition. Two female Galea which lived in the pen for a year produced litters at regular intervals but were only able to raise two young to the age of six weeks. Most juvenile Galea died when less than a week old for undetermined reasons. On one occasion a female Galea was seen eating a still living juvenile. Since many Microcavia behavior patterns previously discussed ap- pear to be adaptations to life in an open environment, it is not sur- prising that rodents in other families which live in similar habitats have evolved similar patterns. Relatively long-term field studies of the social behavior of two sciurid rodents, the black-tailed prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus (King, 1955), and the Uinta ground squirrel, Citellus armatus (Balph and Stokes, 1963), both of which occupy open grassland habitats in western United States, are available for com- parison. These rodents can be considered ecological equivalents of Microcavia in that they occupy similar habitats and have similar vegetarian food habits. Like Microcavia both have an alarm call, well- developed vision, and upright attend postures. They dig burrows, and dash to them in response to the attend postures and alarm calls of conspecifics. All these are adaptations which help protect these rodents from aerial and ground predators. When we consider the social organizations of these rodents, how- ever, we find that they differ in several respects. Prairie dogs have a well-developed social organization with the coterie as the basic unit. All members defend the coterie territory against intraspecific invaders. Relationships between coterie members are typically friendly and tactile stimuli are important in integrating the group. In contrast, ground squirrels are solitary except for brief male-female contacts in the breeding season. Interactions are aggressive and each animal forms dominance-subordination relationships with its neighbors. Females are dominant to males after the breeding season and force them from favorable areas.

Microcavia social organization shows some similarities to that of prairie dogs and ground squirrels, but differs from both in several respects. Like prairie dogs, tactile stimuli are important in group life. Both species exhibit the kiss which functions in individual recognition. Microcavzia male-female, adult-juvenile, and female-female (when two females occupy the same bush) relationships are similar to prairie dog relationships within the coterie. However, prairie dog social organ- ization emphasizes group territorial defense-not found in Microcavia. Cooperation is minimal in cavy society whereas the more permanent social structure of prairie dogs emphasizes cooperation and defense of the young (King, 1955). Microcavia social organization is similar to that of Citelius in that the home range is not defended, and dominance relationships order the society. However, whereas ground squirrels lead primarily solitary lives (Balph and Stokes, 1963), Microcavia form amicable contactual relationships with other individuals. The social organization of two genera of lagomorphs, Sylvilagus (Marsden and Conaway, 1963; Marsden and Holler, 1964) and Oryctolagus (Mykytowycz, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961; Lockley, 1961) studied under seminatural conditions, shows many similarities to that of Microcavia. Male-male interactions are hostile and organized by a stable straight-line dominance hierarchy. Male-female relationships are typically friendly. Males are attracted to the pregnant female several days before parturition. At the postpartum estrus the female leaves the birth site and the males chase and mate with her if they can separate her from their rivals. The female hides during estrus and the males track her by scent. Relationships between adults and juveniles are similar in rabbits and Microcavia. Whereas adult males are friendly with juveniles, adult female Oryctolagus and Microcavia are sometimes aggressive and thus aid in the dispersal of the young. Adult male Microcavia respond sexually to juveniles, and male Sylvilagus often follow young females (Marsden and Holler, 1964). However, the sexual interest of adult male Microcavia in male juveniles appears to have no counterpart in rabbits, or in those rodents which have been studied. The system of population dispersion differs between Oryctolagus and Microcavia, since the former establish warrens and defend the area around them (Lockley, 1961). Marsden and Holler (1964) sug- gest that the swamp rabbit is territorial whereas the cottontail is not. However, although there are some differences, the social organization of Microcavia appears to be considerably more like that of rabbits than like prairie dogs or ground squirrels. Behavioral similarities of Micro- cavia to these sciurids are largely convergences evolved to proteet the species from predators in an open habitat. However, similarities in social organization to forms occupying different habitat types, i.e., rab-</page><page sequence="39">1970 ROOD: ECOLOGY OF THE DESERT CAVY 453 bits, suggest that many of the selective pressures affecting social organ- ization may be relatively independent of habitat. Microcavia, Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus all have a high reproduc- tive potential when compared with Cynomys and Citellus, and similar- ities in their societies may be correlated with this. While female prairie dogs and ground squirrels raise only one litter/year and the young do not breed until their second or third year, female Microcavia, Syivilagus and Oryctolagus raise several litters/year and the young may breed in their year of birth. This high reproductive potential is balanced by a correspondingly high mortality rate. For example, King (1955) found that the annual per cent population loss of prairie dogs was about 33%, whereas at La Cristina 33% of the Microcavia population frequently disappeared within a period of six weeks. A high mortality rate imposes many limitations on the type of society which can de- velop. A relatively brief individual life span means that stable social relationships have little time to form. Since the individual matures rapidly there is less opportunity for learning social conventions during development. What mechanisms have been evolved to reduce mortality in Citellus and Cynomys? In Citellus, one is hibernation, which protects it throughout much of the year. Although prairie dogs may be inactive in periods of heavy snowfall, they are subject to mortality throughout the winter months. However, their social organization is effective in reducing mortality through predation and in regulating population density. Thus the individual prairie dog has a greater life expectancy than the individual Microcavia, perhaps largely because of the more efficient social organization in which it develops. Whereas the young Microcavia is physically and sexually mature at three months, the three-month-old prairie dog is still an immature and protected pup. This longer period of development of the prairie dog, in which it gradually matures in a highly protective environment defended by adults, not only reduces juvenile mortality but provides more oppor- tunity for learning. The Microcavia operates as an individual, whereas the prairie dog is a member of an integrated group, in which communi- cation and cooperation in such aspects as territorial defense and home- making help to preserve the individual.
