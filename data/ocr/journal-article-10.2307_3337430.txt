Indeed, his allusion to mirrors brings to mind James Fernandez's pertinent observa- fre Cn- tions about the odd "self-objectification of a ek Ducju &amp;n- mirror" and how "the tricks of mirrors lend eck Ducaju &amp; n distributor: support to the notion that in them one can see n distributor: attle. 214 pp. beyond this world to the next world or the drawings, I world of imagination" (1986:163).

Kifwebe masks are wish to sig- active presences, and given our understand- ;ious neglect ing of neighboring cultures, they bear surpris- african arts spring 1997 ingly negative coercive powers. When Hersak states that "power indicators were differently construed in the past and prone to regional variation" (p. 165), we see the processual nature of art history-with emphasis on this last word. Hersak then turns her attention from face masks to their representation on shields made by Songye and neighboring Luba. As the accompanying color pho- tographs attest, these are literally dazzling objects, for the central mask shapes are sur- rounded by swirls and patterns of such astounding complexity that the masks seem to hover and shift against these polychromat- ic fields. Hersak's discussion of the trading of these emblems of power (for they were prob- ably only used in symbolic battle) is especial- ly useful; in this, Songye participated in the exchange of other regalia such as Luba staffs and bowstands, found hundreds of miles from their origins and reinterpreted to fit new aesthetic criteria and needs (Roberts &amp; Roberts 1996:235-36). Such diffusion of material culture is even more dramatically demonstrated by copper crosses, as engagingly reported by archaeol- ogist Pierre de Maret. Malachite lodes in the Copper Belt of what is now southernmost Zaire have been worked for hundreds of years, and their copper has long been cast as cross-shaped ingots. These were used locally as special-purpose (and for a while perhaps even as general-purpose) currency, presum- ably for bridewealth and other significant transactions. Crosses were also traded throughout central Africa, and have been found in significant numbers in ancient Zimbabwe and across Angola; indeed, in the early nineteenth century, Portuguese traders even shipped them to Brazil (p. 137). De Maret offers a useful review of the different shapes, sizes, dates, and origins of copper crosses, and their centrality to ritual could not be better portrayed than by his full-page color photograph (p. 142) of an excavated fourteenth-century grave, showing a cross on the ribs of a skeleton. The author ends with a nice twist, demonstrating the manner in which symbols are forever reinvented. A photograph of a Catholic choir of Lubumba- shi, circa 1980, shows each boy wearing a copper cross on his chest, "reviving a use that is more than five centuries old" (p. 144)-or, probably more accurately, creating a new Christian use that is curiously reso- nant with long-forgotten purposes. Copper is not the only symbolically charged substance discussed in these pages. Pierre Petit writes about "sacred kaolin" and the bowl-bearing figures created by Luba to contain it. His piece is based upon disserta- tion research among Luba of southern Zaire and his more recent work among Bwile and related peoples of the Luba/Tabwa conver- gence zone of northeastern Zambia. Petit pre- sents a masterful review of colonial literature, much of it very obscure, which he integrates with his own field data as background for an iconography of bowl-bearing figures. His dis- cussion of Luba royal investiture and of the ways that "sacred kaolin" was obtained from 85</page><page sequence="2">or associated with an underwater experi- ence-which in one case included catching an albino tilapia fish (p. 116)-is particularly interesting. Petit's Luba fieldwork was con- ducted at some of the same times, in some of the same places, and with some of the same informants as Mary Nooter Roberts's, and readers will recognize certain overlaps with her published work as well as my own, con- cerning Tabwa and related peoples; indeed, we have been working with Petit to develop perspectives together (e.g., Petit 1996). Two papers address other issues of mas- querade among Zairian peoples. Habi Buganza Mulinda offers material from his dis- sertation on Woyo, a Kongo subgroup most familiar to Western specialists for their wood- en pot lids carved to suggest pithy aphorisms. Woyo masks are colorful affairs, and perform- ers dance in huge costumes of banana leaves, as reconstructed in the recent "Face of the Spirits" exhibition (Herreman &amp; Petridis 1993). Mulinda tells how masks were first obtained and offers tantalizing data about the "belly of the rainbow" initiation into the mas- querade society. "The rainbow is seen by the Woyo as an enormous snake with its mouth wide open" (p. 154), and here one hopes that, as Luc de Heusch's student and sometime col- laborator through the CNRS, Mulinda will find an opportunity to apply his teacher's methods as developed in The Drunken King, or, The Origin of the State (1982) to situate Woyo masks in the greater cosmology of Bantu- speaking peoples. Most interesting is Mulinda's assertion that despite the seeming anthropomorphism of Woyo masks, "in no case...is the mask an incarnation of the spirit" (p. 151). Instead, masks are named according to the first words of adages, and "the text is always a moral one, because the proverbs concern uplifting cultural values" (p. 156). Mulinda has catalogued fifty-six different masks, some of which are known to have been per- formed for over a century. Several are com- monly found, such as Tendekele, "The Palm Sapling," so named for the saying "The palm sapling is scorned: where men were, others replace them." Mulinda explains that young people these days may be belittled, but they are still their people's future (p. 157). Through careful choreography, the masks prove as "pictographic" as Woyo pot lids, Mulinda concludes (p. 158). Luc de Heusch also writes about masks, returning to his fieldwork of the 1950s among the so-called Tetela peoples of Zaire. Here de Heusch joins the growing ranks of Africanist scholars who recognize that the first questions to ask about art must concern ethnicity. Who the "Tetela" might be is matched by who they most probably are not; indeed, de Heusch asserts that many whom outsiders have called "Tetela" are "really" Nkutshu. As I found in the equally complicated history of Tabwa peo- ples of southeastern Zaire (Roberts 1985, 1989), although precolonial and early colonial peoples may have possessed other social identities, they have now come to assume those thrust upon them in the colonial period. 86 "Tabwa"-probably like "Tetela"-is now as real as the earlier designations, and people add such names to the list of those available to them from lineage, clan, chiefdom, profession, secret society, introduced religion, region, political party, and, nowadays, perhaps even soccer team or preferred brand of beer. To some degree ethnic identity is situationally decided, then, as many writers have noted, even as people continue to oppress and kill according to these perceived differences. De Heusch's article is long and rich for area specialists, but generalists may wish to leaf ahead to his declaration that "There are no Tetela masks" (p. 188). Given the plethora of masks recently collected among nearby Ituri peoples (Felix 1992), whom Huguette Van Geluwe once similarly pronounced "without masks" (1960), this is a dicey propo- sition. Still, as with his willingness to wrestle with the squirmy details of "Tetela" ethnicity, de Heusch shows courage in confronting the equally tricky matter of attribution, and he convinces us that well-known masks in muse- um collections are probably Songye rather than "Tetela." De Heusch concludes with snippets of data from his own fieldwork con- cerning figures and face painting. His photos of this latter stand among the great illustra- tions of ephemeral body arts. The remaining three articles in Objects: Signs of Africa are the most problematic. Viviane Baeke presents the longest piece of the book, and although she offers a great deal of fascinating firsthand ethnography, her arguments tying it together are exceedingly difficult to follow. Baeke is the first Western scholar to work among Wuli, a tiny subgroup of Mfumte, who in turn are one of a congeries of peoples in west-central Cameroon among whom Mambila are best known to outsiders. Ro is the source of power and inspiration for Wuli, as animated by auspicious water spirits and afflicting ghosts (p. 64). These contrary forces exist in creative tension in certain objects, such as clay figurines kept in sanctu- aries with toothy buffalo masks and wind instruments made from gourds. Fruitful comparison might be drawn to research on peoples in several directions, beginning with Maria Berns's work on clay figures and gourds among Ga'anda and related groups of the eastern Nigerian borderlands (e.g., Berns 1988, 1990). Of particular interest is Baeke's discussion of Sho (or S6) fiber body masks of the sort famously illustrated but left virtually unexplained by Paul Gebauer (1979:15, 358). These are Ro objects too, im- bued with transformative power, and one hopes they will be a more detailed focus of Baeke's writing in the future. Philippe Jespers's "Mask and Utterance" is an analysis of Komo society auditory masks among Minyanka people of Mali. Here Jespers adds to his impressive articles in the CNRS journal Systemes de Pensde en Afrique Noire with a richly nuanced exposition of the history, practice, and material culture of Minyanka Komo. The society has only recent- ly been adopted and adapted by Minyanka, and one hopes that Jespers will continue to african arts spring 1997 write about its ongoing elaboration; a more detailed piece exploring the way that Min- yanka Muslims accept Komo despite their aversion to other "traditional" practices (p. 41) would be most welcome, for example. Jespers masterfully explains that in Komo, "the substance of the mask is first of all a voice," through which the performer "punctu- ate[s] a 'site' (by saturating it with its voice)" (p. 45). The voice is effected with a friction drum, and as it is played, space is proven any- thing but "a neutral medium in which the mask operates" (p. 48). Here Jespers might refer to the growing literature on the concep- tualization of social space and the transforma- tion of site to place through mnemonics (Roberts &amp; Roberts 1996). As it stands, Jespers's material is exciting, but one is left aghast by his lack of reference to anglophone literature. Objects: Signs of Africa was probably in the works by the time Philip Peek's "The Sounds of Silence: Cross-World Communication and the Auditory Arts in African Societies" appeared in American Ethnologist in 1994; but it is scandalous that Jespers should neglect Edward Lifschitz's "Hearing Is Believing: Acoustic Aspects of Masking in Africa," when it was published in a collection issued by the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1988. Similarly, to ignore Patrick McNaughton's longstanding work on Komo masks (e.g., 1988) is inexcusable: to do so is to appropriate as original, data and ideas that have already appeared elsewhere or, at the very least, are complementary to one's own findings. Even more glaring neglect is to be found in the paper by Michele Coquet on Bwaba leaf masks. Granted, she offers interesting per- spectives on how the force of Doo is repre- sented, "feeding on his own leaves" through performance. The amorphous constructions are "things of only one side," as Bwaba say, for they have "no marked direction" and so are meant to convey-and be-an essence rather than anything simply iconic (pp. 26-27). These brilliant sparks are extinguished by the complete absence of reference to the work of Christopher Roy on the very same masks in some of the very same Burkinabe villages, readily available to Dr. Coquet in a book published in France (Roy 1987). Not only does this unethically assert primacy on a path blazed by another, but Coquet's own intellectual progress is blunted by ignoring Roy's insights (and his far superior photogra- phy which he lends so freely). As but one example, had she considered Roy's discussion of the polyvalence of particular symbolic fea- tures of wooden mask faces (1987:297), her own presentation (p. 33) would have been far more nuanced. A last gripe and a summing up: translation from French to English by A. B. West is occa- sionally so flawed as to subvert a careful read- er's use of the texts. The book is marred by spelling errors and the occasional grammati- cal slip; by the use of casual phrasing and colloquialisms; and by the lack of any publi- cation date, contributors' biographies (how do we contact them?), index, and maps for</page><page sequence="3">some articles for which they would have been critically useful. The fact that the title is not explained in any text diminishes the volume's impact. Some of these shortcomings are more the fault of copyediting than translation. Worst of all, though, is West's choice of certain words. Neither wood nor flesh can be "sol- dered" (pp. 68, 84); iron is rarely if ever "cast" in Africa (p. 84); odors cannot "echo" (p. 62); perles in French are beads, not "pearls" (p. 126); gourds, not "calabashes," grow in Africa; and it is probably "chalk" (calcium carbonate, CaC03), not "kaolin" (the rarer aluminum silicate used to produce porcelain, AlSO3-2SiO2-2H20), used in Luba and other African rituals. Such flaws can subvert an author's best intentions. For example, a significant point of Jespers's exposition lies in the identification of the animal reference(s) of the Komo masks he illustrates. The masks are said to refer to the "catamount," an obsolete term from Medieval English for "leopard," which only appears now as one of several American colloqui- alisms for "mountain lion" (Oxford English Dictionary 1982:353). In other words, cata- mounts are not African at all, and we are left to wonder whether Jespers means "lion," "leopard," "hyena" (which he also mentions), or most probably, some combination of them all (Roberts 1995:92-93). With similar difficul- ties hobbling our reading throughout the book, when we come to a phrase such as "He who obnubilates the diviner's oracle, ultimate- ly eradicates the lineage" (Devisch, p. 98, my emphasis), our obfuscation is absolute. Did the author mean to convey the dictionary sense of this altogether arcane word ("to dark- en as by a cloud"-OED 1982:1965), or is a simpler sense of obscurity meant by the Yaka verb N-sweekya and conveyed in Devisch's original text? My suggestion to specialists who need this book would be to purchase the French version (or if your French ain't too hot, buy both English and French copies if you can afford them). Rather than end my review with such glum stuff, I should reiterate that there are flashes of brilliance here, in the form of use- ful reviews of previously available materi- als, and of ethnography and analysis new to this publication. Regarding the book's theo- retical contributions, anglophone readers will find the most innovative approaches to context-sensitive African art history as de- veloped over the last thirty years or so to be reconfirmed in Objects: Signs of Africa (al- though do not look for reflexivity: none of these authors addresses this hot topic of late- twentieth-century sociological discourse). Finally, if there is anything positive in sever- al authors' outrageous neglect of said litera- ture, it is the clarion call for better communication across the waters and other arbitrary barriers. After all, how many of us anglophones have read and actively use the pertinent articles of, say, the two issues of Systemes de Pensde en Afrique Noire dedicated to "les fetiches" (cahiers 8, 1985, and 12, 1993)? Don't admit it, just do it! D References cited, page 96 AFRICUS Johannesburg Biennale, 1995 Transitional Metropolitan Council, Johannesburg, 1995. 304 pp., 30 b/w &amp; 219 color illustrations. R 140 softcover. Reviewed by Garth Claassen "Here Comes Everybody," the title to Thomas McEvilley's essay in the exhibition catalogue for "Africus," the first Johannesburg Biennale (1995), may conveniently serve to describe that highly inclusive publication. McEvilley's optimistic proposition is that the breakdown of a monolithic Western definition of high cul- ture may result in a "type of visual diplomacy that introduces the peoples of the world to one another in their living reality" (p. 57). This outcome was also the heartfelt hope of Bien- nale organizers Christopher Till and Lorna Ferguson, and catalogue editors Alan Bowyer and Candice Breitz. "Here Comes Everybody" is applicable in other, more prosaic, ways to the Africus cata- logue. This volume's 300 pages contain not only commissioned essays by American and Euro- pean critics like McEvilley, Arthur Danto, and Jean-Hubert Martin and South Africans such as Bongi Dhlomo, Anitra Nettleton, and Sandra Klopper, but also mini-essays, each covering one of 100 or so exhibition installations. Obviously they vary considerably in style and substance: some are poignant, others instruct us with charts and diagrams on models of cultural interaction, and a few are carefully researched art-historical articles. Add to this photo essays, illustrations of artworks (three or four to a page in some cases), and pictures of community art centers, and Africus comes across a little like the scrapbook of a hyperactive eccentric. Certainly the catalogue is not user-friendly, and one can imagine future historians finding it a tantalizing but frustrating resource. Several artworks are unattributed, as are occasional news photographs. While some of the contribu- tors include notes and references, a general bib- liography would have been helpful. There is a roster of participating artists which includes brief biographical and bibliographical informa- tion on each, but the citations are often sloppy and incomplete. Critics, historians, and cura- tors are simply identified by name, and one is not told why their achievements or affiliations made them a logical choice for participation in Africus. What of the poor reader, impressed by one of the essays, who would like to find some- thing else by the same author? What of the hap- less lesser-known author whose emerging readership faces such an obstacle to further acquaintance? How is "visual diplomacy" sup- posed to function in the long term if only the vaguest clues are supplied to the "living reali- ty" of Africus's many contributors? These basic questions should have been addressed. Clearly the catalogue developed as a justi- fication for the exhibition rather than as a pub- african arts spring 1997 lication in its own right with a set of clearly defined goals. Till's foreword and Ferguson's essay, "Reflections on the Question: Why a Johannesburg Biennale?" (pp. 9-11), are per- suasive arguments for doing the show, but the catalogue is mentioned only by Ferguson, and just in the section where she extends her thanks to editors Bowyer and Breitz. To them should have fallen the task of writing an intro- duction that provided the reader with a guide to what might be found in the volume, why its contributors were asked for submissions, what threads might link their various discussions, and so forth. After all, once a show is over the single most comprehensive record of it and the thinking of its organizers is the catalogue. Breitz did write a lively and articulate essay which discusses the Biennale goals, but it is placed second to last in the volume (pp. 288-89), and its rebarbative title, "Towards a Cyber-Creativity in Post-Apartheid South Africa (From Identification to Affinity)," would not lead the reader to conclude that it had any- thing substantial to offer on the motivations of the organizers. It does, but it too omits any mention of the catalogue's function when it could so easily have been adapted to do so. These obstacles to accessibility are com- pounded by the prevalence of a writing style that is often opaque and overly complicated. Every significant art publication assumes the existence of common knowledge and jargon, but in Africus we frequently have the paradox of democratic sentiments couched in a man- ner guaranteed to baffle all but a thin slice of the educated elite. To be sure, some highly intelligent and qualified people are incapable of writing plainly, but this is where the editors could have stepped in. Much of the art in the Biennale was diffi- cult, and again the editors could have per- formed a valuable service by discussing it-not to explain away its subtlety and com- plexity, but to provide their readership with a toehold for further exploration of some very challenging and rewarding work. In Breitz's essay, and elsewhere, there is a praiseworthy desire to avoid "a rhetoric of integration" that would ignore the diversity of art produced in South Africa (p. 288). In the compiling of the catalogue a shift seems to have occurred, per- haps unwittingly, from this tenable position to a far more debatable one: that is, to the attitude that any synthesizing commentary is automat- ically an authoritarian imposition on the work and the reader. Yet it might be countered that helping your readers find their way around the concepts underlying the catalogue is not the same thing as "colonising" their minds. In short there is a lack of concern for the basic needs of the intelligent nonspecialist and for later readers who would not be approaching the material in the same pres- sure-cooker political and cultural atmos- phere that characterized the change from an apartheid government to a democratically elected one. This is jarringly at odds with the democratizing goals of the show, and it is almost certainly not the impression that the organizers and catalogue editors wished to leave us with. 87</page><page sequence="4">C L.A -....FI i A _3..... $1.20 per word, minimum $30.

Griaule, Dieterlen, and the others in their circle were the original promoters of this view of the Dogon, but Bouju assiduously avoids criticizing them directly. In contrast, he directly names Jean Laude in his cri- tique of art historians (p. 222, fn. 8). 5. The note on page 246 explains that in each case one of the pos- sible dates has a greater probability of being accurate, but the chart does not make clear which of the dates for a given object is the most probable and what is its percentage of probability. 6. Another problem with the dating presented in this cata- logue is its verifiability. Leveau tells us which laboratory he used for dating the twenty-two objects in his study, and gives us the test numbers. However, there are several other objects, not in Leveau's project, for which the captions include dates (pp. 37, 79, 91, 109, 113, 152, 160). While it is never directly stated, it appears that these dates were derived from radio- carbon tests. Unfortunately, information that would allow the reader to verify and analyze the dates (name of laboratory, test number, standard deviation) is not provided. 7. The chart on page 247 lists as one of the objects tested (no. 19) a Dogon antelope mask that is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1977.394.37; Brooklyn Museum 1973: no. 96). This must be a typographical error, since according to Museum records, this object has never been sampled for radiocarbon testing. Unfortunately, such an error might lead unsuspecting readers to draw unreasonable con- clusions concerning the age of Dogon masks. 8. The two radiocarbon dates given for the toguna post, 1580 and (with a lower probability) 1780, illustrate some of the problems with these dates and the fact that they are not ana- lyzed for the reader. Wooden toguna posts come from Dogon villages on the S6no plain rather than on the Bandiagara cliffs, where toguna supports are made of stone. If, as Jean- Christophe Huet contends (see below), Dogon people only began to inhabit the Seno plain in the second half of the nine- teenth century, these radiocarbon dates cannot indicate the date at which the post was carved. 9. Huet's study is not the first to provide real life, rather than idealized, mythological models of Dogon architecture and vil- lage planning. Two excellent studies are by Gerard Brasseur (1968) and Francine N'Diaye (1972). 10. In villages on the scree, rather than on top of the cliffs, the movement is upward rather than toward the center.
