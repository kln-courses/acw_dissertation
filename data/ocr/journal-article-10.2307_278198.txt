<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS One minor omission bothers this reviewer. Although the author assumes the Doraces (Dorasques) and their neighbors were the descendants of those responsible for the "Classical Chiriqui" ceramics, it is not made clear that they were resettled from the Caribbean watershed to the vicinity of the Pacific coast in Chiriqui and, at least through language, were akin to the Guaymi, T!6r- raba (Tiribi), Bribri, and Boruca of Panama and Costa Rica (W. Lehmann, 1920, Zentral-Amerika, B. I., pp. 150, 173). This in itself may explain some of the simi- larities in the design motifs and ceramic styles of eastern Costa Rica and the Chiriqui region. Certainly the shell and bone ornaments of the Costa Rican Diquis territory, the conventionalized alligator-serpent designs on pottery, and the jaguar effigy grinding stones are familiar to this entire Pacific area and even extend into that of Tala- manca in the northeast of Costa Rica. This suggests the development of a cultural conquest impelled by reli- gious concepts and manifested in painted and sculptured motifs. Some of the planning of the book is puzzling. The "Introduction," which includes the geography and his- tory of archaeological work in Chiriqui, is followed by the detailed and carefully explained excavations and cultural phases; an account of the "European Conquest and the Assimilation of the Indians of Chiriqui," which we feel should have preceded the technical chapters, was left almost for the end. The result is a tendency to confuse the reader "chronologically." But although we may quibble over a difference in position, it cannot mar the scholarly workmanship and contribution to our general knowledge of the archaeology of this hitherto little known part of the Gulf of Chiriqui. DORIS STONE Peabody Museum Cambridge, Massachusetts Proceedings of the Second International Congress for the Study of PreColumbian Cultures in the Lesser Antilles, St. Ann's Garrison, Barbados, July 24-28, 1967. Edited by RIPLEY P. BULLEN. Barbados: Bar- bados Museum, 1968. viii+146 pp., 24 figs., 10 tables, 1 map. $5.00. Until recently, archaeological research in the Carib- bean area has been concentrated in the Greater Antilles and on the South American mainland. The inter- vening islands of the Lesser Antilles have largely been ignored. This reflects the situation in the time of Colum- bus, when the native populations of the Greater Antil- les and the mainland were larger, wealthier, and cul- turally more advanced. Archaeologists, like the colonists before them, have preferred to center their efforts in the more affluent parts of the Caribbean area. The resultant gap in our knowledge is now being filled by a combination of amateur archaeologists re- siding in the Lesser Antilles and professionals from the United States, foremost among whom are Ripley P. Bullen of the Florida State Museum and William G. Haag of Louisiana State University. They have estab- lished a Permanent Organization for the Study of Pre- Columbian Cultures of the Lesser Antilles and have held three congresses, the first in Martinique in 1961, the second in Barbados in 1967, and the third in Grenada in 1969. The volume under review consists of the papers read at the second congress. Methodology was a particular concern of the second congress, since it had caused trouble at the first con- gress. The delegation from the French islands had insisted that the only proper way to interpret the re- mains was to apply ethnohistorical terms to them, viz., Carib, which is the name of the historic inhabitants of the Lesser Antilles, and Arawak, which is the name of the language supposedly spoken by the Indians whom the Carib claimed to have conquered. The United States delegation, on the contrary, had advocated set- ting up local ceramic and cultural sequences, based upon the remains themselves, before trying to decide which members of each sequence are likely to have been Carib and which Arawak. In the present volume, the French have retreated from their extreme position and show a healthy interest in working out the sequences on their islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Se- quences are also given for Barbados, Grenada, and St. Lucia by Bullen and for Dominica by Clifford Evans of the U.S. National Museum. In addition there are discus- sions of ceramic seriation and cultural classification by Betty J. Meggers of the National Museum and Ronald J. Vanderwal of the Institute of Jamaica. Nevertheless, the previous interest in identifying the Carib and Arawak persists. The French present their ceramic sequences not so much for their own sake as to demonstrate that the Carib conquest of the Arawak must have taken place about A.D. 500. Bullen, on the contrary, concludes from his sequences that the Carib did not arrive from the mainland of South America before A.D. 1100-1200. Evans implicitly accepts Bullen's conclusion by labeling the second and third part of his Dominican sequence Arawak and Historical Carib, re- spectively, but expresses doubt about the procedure by putting both terms in quotes. Haag argues that all such identifications are premature and questions whether we will ever be able to arrive at a generally acceptable identification of Carib and Arawak remains. Ecology is another popular theme. Haag discusses the environment of the Lesser Antilles and its effect upon human migrations from South America. Evans offers an ecological explanation for the scarcity of human remains in Dominica. Elizabeth Wing, of the Florida State Museum, reconstructs hunting and fishing activi- ties from the vertebrate remains recovered by Haag and Bullen. Mario Sanoja, of the Universidad Central in Caracas, makes a similar study of his zoological finds from the Guadalupe and Zancudo phases of western Venezuela. Finally, there is a brief summary of Carib culture during the colonial period by Pierre Verin. The volume would have benefited from more care- ful editing. Edgar Clerc states that zoned-incised cross- 121</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY hatching is absent from the earliest component at Morel, Guadeloupe, whereas Jacques Pettijean-Roget as- serts that it is there, as well as in Diamant I, Martini- que. Evans adopts Bullen's term "Caribbean Saladoid- Barrancoid or Pre-Arawak" for the original occupation of Dominica, but Bullen himself employs a simplified and improved version of the term, Caribbean Saladoid. Several authors ignore the work of predecessors. Sanoja discusses the Guadalupe phase of Venezuela with- out explaining that Osgood, Howard, Kidder, Cruxent, and the reviewer have called this phase Tierra de los Indios. Evans informs us that "prior to 1966 no intensive studies had been made on" Dominica (p. 93), though Marshall McKusick conducted such a study for Yale University in 1959. Since Bullen did not himself find zoned-incised crosshatching, which is the marker for the first Saladoid migration into the Antilles, on Trinidad, he concludes that the island was by-passed, ignoring the reviewer's discovery of zoned-incised crosshatching there. Verin's summary of Carib culture is presented without reference to the definitive research on the subject by Douglas Taylor of Dominica. These omissions give the volume an appearance of poor scholarship which it does not otherwise deserve. IRVING ROUSE Yale University New Haven, Connecticut Archeological Investigations on the Rio Napo, Eastern Ecuador. CLIFFORD EVANS AND BETTY J. MEGGERS. Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology, Vol. 6, Washington, 1968. xvi + 127 pp., 80 figs., 95 pls., 15 tables, appendix. $4.50. Evans and Meggers have again produced an impressive monograph based on field work (Oct.-Dec. 1956) in an archaeologically little-known part of South America. The authors investigated a number of isolated habita- tion sites with shallow refuse deposits. Under these circumstances little stratigraphic information was obtained and none at all on architecture or burials. The two sites of the Yasuni phase, oldest of the four phases that were recognized, yielded a badly eroded sherd sample on which even the incised decoration rarely remains visible. Red slip occurs in a few cases. There is a single radiocarbon date of 50 B.c. + 90 (SI-300). The decorated vessels of the Tivacundo phase (two sites) carry intricate patterns traced in red paint with or without zonification. The age is indicated by a radio- carbon date of A.D. 510 ? 70 (SI-330). The Napo phase (seven sites) is characterized by spectacular pottery de- coration executed in a variety of techniques including incision, excision, and painting (both negative and posi- tive). To this phase belong the famous anthropomorphic burial urns with painted designs added to their modeled features (none was found on this expedition). The three radiocarbon dates do not agree well with the seriated sequence of Napo phase sherd samples, as the authors themselves point out (pp. 80-1), but viewed on their own merits, there is little reason to doubt the validity of any of them, once their standard error ranges are taken into account: A.D. 1168 ? 53 (P-347); A.D. 1179 + 51 (P-269); A.D. 1480 + 180 (SI-299). Accordingly, the Napo phase flourished in the 12/13th - 14/15th centuries A.D. When the Spaniards first arrived in 1541 (misprinted 1521 on p. 81), this section of the river was uninhabited. The phase, then, seems to have cover- ed a relatively short timespan, and this is supported by the seriational evidence which shows no major cultural changes (p. 81). The Cotacocha phase, probably a manifestation of "the recent spread of Quechua speaking acculturated Indians down the Napo" (p. 86)-the Quijo-is the last of the sequence. The report is excellently organized along the lines set down in the authors' previous publications. Pottery is described in terms of vessel shapes, pottery types, and types of decoration. The latter, too, are labeled as pottery types, but this is an overstatement: "Tivacundo Incised and Zoned Red" (p. 26), for example, is a pottery type that was executed on four plain pottery types! If J. A. Ford's classificatory system is basically to be upheld, it might be advisable to treat the types of decoration within a separate category, just as vessel shapes are now treated. A tentative reconstruction of Amazon prehistory is presented in the final section. In the authors' view, the advances of Tropical Forest culture were caused by re- peated Andean infiltrations which rarely, however, achieved permanency in the hostile lowlands environ- ment. This hypothesis can hardly be proven or rejected in toto on the basis of present evidence. While con- fident darts still dash across the maps, the text (pp. 88- 110) shows that the authors do not actually continue to support their earlier rather positive statements without reservations: "the spread of the Polychrome Horizon Style cannot be interpreted as a simple downriver move- ment" (p. 106). The final discussion, however, is re- stricted to the Amazon Basin (pp. 107-10) which elimi- nates the important and early center on the lower Orinoco River (Fig. 80). Yasuni is considered a member of the "Zoned Ha- chure Horizon Style" which, according to the authors, originated around 3000 B.c. in northern Colombia, pass- ing through highland Ecuador about 1700 B.c. on its way to Kotosh (Waira-jirca phase). From somewhere along this route, it spread to the Ananatuba phase on Marajo Island (980 B.c. ? 200), a logical assumption, unless an independent origin is considered for the cross hachure decoration there or an ancestral style older than 1000 B.c. is found in Venezuela. The origins of the Yasuni phase itself (50 B.C. ? 90) remain obscure. Was it derived from some source in the Amazon Basin (un- dated Jauari?), from an unknown complex in the eastern Andes, or from Tutishcainyo to which it seems to be more closely related? It is difficult to follow the authors everywhere on this hike of 3,000 years to scattered sites distributed over half a subcontinent (El Mayal!). The Tivacundo phase is not linked with any other known 122 [ VOL. 35, No. 1, 1970</page></plain_text>
