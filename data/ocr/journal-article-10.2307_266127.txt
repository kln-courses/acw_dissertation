Paris: Presses Uni- versitaires de France, 1953. Pp. iv+ 124 4-15 pls. Fr. 1200. In the course of his researches in con- nection with the preceding monograph, M. Le Gall came across material bearing upon the cult of Pater Tiberinus, which he felt would be of interest to the student of Ro- man religion and to the art historian. The result is this supplementary volume in which the author lays the foundation for further study of some of the problems to which he calls attention. Beginning with the anthropomorphic aspect of the cult, M. Le Gall studied in some detail the statue of the Tiber in the Louvre, which he compared with its companionpiece the Vatican Nile. Other representations of the river god in sculpture, painting, on coins, and in scanty passages in literature bring the author to the conclusion that the an- thropomorphic aspect of this cult lost sig- nificance and finally vanished. The fact that the conception of the Tiber as a divinity did not suffer Oriental and Gxreek influences during the classical period fur- ther supports-this theory. In discussing the question as to whether the religious acts which were formerly as- sociated with the cult of the Tiber were transferred to some other divinity, M. Le Gall rejects the hypothesis that Vulcan was ever a river god. Provocative questions such as the origin of Portunus, the signifi- cance of the Etruscan Vertumnus, and the relation of Volturnus to the cult of the Tiber are raised for the consideration of specialists in the field of Roman religion. That the worship originally'accorded to Pater Tiberinus gave way to adoration of the, waters of the river is regarded as a natural consequence, since running waters were considered to have supernatural pow- ers and to possess the ability to purify and to heal. Search for a description of objects found in the bed and on the banks of the Tiber br,ught M. Le Gall to material in the archives of the Terme Museum, which had not previously been studied. Careful con- sideration of these reports led the author to take issue with Lanciani, who had ascribed these deposits either as merchan- dise coming from shops near the Pons Fa- bricius, or as votive offerings presented to Esculapius, whose temple was on the island in the Tiber. M. Le Gall presents evidence to support his theory that these objects were offered to the sacred waters of the river because of their curative qualities. As the author himself points out, in this later volume he is concerned with un domaine nouveau. Conscious of his inabil- ity to speak in tones of authority on the subject under discussion, M. Le Gall has, nevertheless, done some excellent spade- work for the definitive book which may some day be written on this subject. DOROTHY M. ROBATHAN Wellesley College</page></plain_text>
