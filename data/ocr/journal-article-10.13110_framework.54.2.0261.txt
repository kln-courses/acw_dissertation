As such, it encourages  attention to the many dimensions of social experience and subjectivity that may  only with difficulty be rendered with words alone. —From the website of the Sensory Ethnography Lab By 2013, the end of its first decade, the Sensory Ethnography Lab (SEL) at  Harvard University had revived interest in ethnographic cinema by instigating  the production of engaging, revealing, immersive sync-sound films, video instal- lations, and sound works by young anthropologists/artists committed to using  media as a means of communicating the broadest range of human experience  (“film” here refers to works made either in 35mm, 16mm, or on one of the video  or digital video formats). Th e filmmaking nurtured by the Sensory Ethnography  Lab is made within a context and an awareness of traditional documentary, and  particularly American ethnographic (and “ethnographic”) cinema, from Robert  Flaherty through John and Lorna Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Timothy Asch.  But it also defies this tradition in several ways—most obviously, perhaps, in its  refusal of didacticism: in the films of Ilisa Barbash/Lucien Castaing-Taylor, J.P.  Sniadecki, Stephanie Spray, and Véréna Paravel, no narrator presumes to provide  explanations or present conclusions. Indeed, many of these films oft en seem less  Framework 54, No. 2, Fall 2013, pp. 261–330.

Early premonitions  of this development include Henwar Rodakiewicz’s Portrait of a Young Man (US,  1931) and Ralph Steiner’s H20 (US, 1929), and some decades later, Nathaniel  Dorsky’s Summerwind (US, 1965) and Bruce Baillie’s All My Life (US, 1966)— though an intensification of what had been a very sporadic approach begins in  the early 1970s with Larry Gottheim’s single-shot films—Fog Line (US, 1970), for  example—Barn Rushes (US, 1971) and the feature-length Horizons (US, 1973),  Robert Huot’s Snow (US, 1971) and Rolls: 1971 (US, 1972), J. J. Murphy’s In  Progress (co-made with Ed Small, US, 1972), Peter Hutton’s New York Near Sleep  for Saskia (US, 1972), Images of Asian Music (A Diary fr om Life) (US, 1974), New  York Portrait, Part I (US, 1977), and James Benning’s 11 X 14 (US, 1976) and One  Way Boogie Woogie (US, 1977). All of these films involve sustained contemplations  of particular environments, oft en in shots of extended duration. Th is particular development can be understood, on one level, as an implicit  reaction to the increased homogenization of American place in the wake of the  completion of the interstate highway system and the resulting development of  national, then international, restaurant and retail chains. Increasingly threatened,  the particularities of specific places have seemed increasingly worthy of cinematic  attention—indeed, of a kind of salvage ethnography. On a formal level, these  films were reactions to the acceleration of commercial media during the 1960s  and 1970s and the increasing overload of images per minute in commercials and  commercial movies—as well as to the implicit training in compulsive consump- tion provided by this acceleration. Th ese new contemplations of place were and  are about slowing down and considering where we are. By the 2000s, this cinema of place had emerged as a major force in indepen- dent film and video. Peter Hutton—Time and Tide (US, 2000), Skagafj ördur  (US, 2004), At Sea (US, 2007)—and Nathaniel Dorsky—Alaya (US, 1987),  Four Cinematic Songs (US, 1996-2001) and Two Devotional Songs (US, 2002- 2004)—continued to build on the accomplishments of their early work; and, like  Hutton, James Benning and Sharon Lockhart continued to mine the potential of  the long-duration image. Benning’s 13 Lakes (US, 2004) and Ten Skies (US, 2004),  and Lockhart’s Pine Flat (US, 2005) are made up of series of 10-minute shots; and  in NŌ (US, 2003) and Double Tide (US, 2009), Lockhart creates the illusion of  even longer shots (30 minutes, 45 minutes, respectively). Benning’s entry into  digital video allowed for shots of virtually any duration: Ruhr (US, 2009) is made  up of six 10-minute shots plus one 60-minute shot. By the early 2000s, these  262 </page> <page sequence="4"> Interviews contemplative approaches to place were finding appreciative audiences: a Film  Comment poll published in May-June 2010 named Dorsky and Benning the top  avant-garde filmmakers of the previous decade and Hutton’s At Sea the best film. If the Sensory Ethnography Lab filmmakers have not been as extreme  as Benning and Lockhart in their use of duration, they have learned to work  with extended shots in comparable ways with comparable eff ect. Benning and  Lockhart, and Hutton as well, are regular visitors to Cambridge (Lockhart made  Double Tide while on a Radcliff e Fellowship; and Lockhart and Hutton are listed  as “associates” of Robert Gardner’s Studio7Arts); their films are exhibited at the  Harvard Film Archive, and have oft en been screened by the Sensory Ethnography  Lab. Th ere are, however, significant diff erences between the films of Benning,  Hutton, and Lockhart, and the videos of Barbash/Castaing-Taylor, Sniadecki,  Spray, and Paravel. An important diff erence is that the Sensory Ethnography Lab filmmakers  do not assume a position of detachment from the world they record or from  the people who are experiencing this world within their imagery. In the films of  Hutton, Benning, and Lockhart, the human beings (and animals) we see, when  we see any, are types, generally seen in long-shot: for example, Japanese farmers,  small-town kids, a woman clamming, in NŌ, Pine Flat, and Double Tide. On the  other hand, with few exceptions, the human beings seen in the videos of Barbash/ Castaing-Taylor, Sniadecki, Spray, and Paravel become characters, people with  personalities as individual as their environments are particular. Further, unlike  Benning, Hutton, and Lockhart, Barbash/Castaing-Taylor, Sniadecki, Spray,  and Paravel are recording not what is out there, but what they can see from their  position within a specific community that interacts with them during the action  of the films. Th is diff erence has a number of formal dimensions. Benning, Hutton,  and Lockhart always work with a tripod, and in most cases they record sound  separately and post-sync their films (Hutton’s films have always been resolutely  silent). In contrast, Barbash/Castaing-Taylor, Sniadecki, Spray, and Paravel  usually hand-hold their cameras, not as a means of drawing particular attention  to themselves-as-artists, but as a subtle emblem of their presence; and generally  they record sound and imagery in sync. Th at is to say, they seem more fully  connected to both their subjects and their equipment than Benning, Hutton  and Lockhart—though, of course, each of the SEL filmmakers articulates this  connectedness in somewhat diff erent ways. As is suggested by the description on the SEL website, “sensory ethnography”  does not assume that the process of filmmaking or the work that results from it  need be limited by the conventions of the theatrical history of cinema (or even  that SEL productions need involve images). “Original nonfiction media practices”  263 </page> <page sequence="5"> Scott MacDonald are to be encouraged so long as they off er hope of providing more interesting and  revealing experiences of “the bodily praxis and aff ective fabric of human existence.”  One of the distinctive qualities of the films produced in conjunction with the lab  has been a commitment to sound and usually sync sound. It is typical of SEL films  that we hear before we see (and aft er we see), and that sound is conceived not as  an adjunct to image, an accompaniment, but as a complex, oft en intense auditory  surround within which the imagery unfolds. Th e sound designs for SEL films are  oft en created in collaboration with Ernst Karel, whose contributions to this body  of work would be difficult to overestimate, and whose own sound works—CDs  include Heard Laboratories (and/OAR, US, 2010) and Swiss Mountain Transport  Systems (Gruenrekorder, US, 2011)—have opened new documentary territory and  have been an important influence on SEL filmmakers. Th e following conversations, developed over the past few years, focus on  some of the accomplishments of the Sensory Ethnography Lab. Th e first sec- tion, “Ruminating on Sweetgrass,” focuses on Sweetgrass (US, 2009), the lab’s  breakthrough film, as well as on more recent work by Castaing-Taylor and on his  thinking about sensory ethnographic filmmaking. Th e second section, “Tales from  the SEL,” focuses on several veterans of the Sensory Ethnography Lab and their  films, and on two of the more successful SEL films, both made collaboratively. Ruminating on Sweetgrass Ilisa Barbash and Lucien Castaing-Taylor’s Sweetgrass (US, 2009) is a work  of self-confessed salvage ethnography that documents the final moments of  a century-old practice in the American west. Near the end of Sweetgrass, two  intertitles explain, “Since the late nineteenth century Western ranchers and their  hired hands have ranged animals on public lands for summer pasture” and “In  2003, over three months and one hundred and fift y miles, the last band of sheep  trailed through Montana’s Absaroka-Beartooth mountains.” Sweetgrass uses no  narration, no music, no explanatory intertitles other than these; its sustained  shots allow us to meditate on places and moments. It is a Western about cowboys  that involves no shoot-outs and no romance. It is a nature film that refuses that  genre’s conventional distinction between nature and human culture, in order to  reveal the intermingled lives and bodies of the sheep and the sheepherders, or as  Castaing-Taylor puts it, of the “sheeple” involved in the epic trek of thousands of  sheep into and out of the mountains and the harvest of wool. Th e series of eight installation works by Castaing-Taylor that also evolved  out of this project focus on particular moments in the lives of sheep and sheep- herders. Hell Roaring Creek (US, 2010), for example, is a 20-minute minimalist  piece during which we watch the “sheeple” cross a creek as morning dawns in the  264 </page> <page sequence="6"> Interviews mountains; the camera is situated in the middle of the creek and we experience  this moment in real time, and surrounded by the dramatic soundscape created by  the creek, the sheep, and sheepherders and their dogs. At the time when they began Sweetgrass, both Barbash and Castaing-Taylor  were teaching anthropology at the University of Colorado, where they were  regular attendees at Stan Brakhage’s salon. Barbash had studied visual anthropol- ogy at the University of Southern California with Timothy Asch; she is currently  a curator of visual anthropology at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.  Castaing-Taylor, also a student of visual anthropology at USC, was editor of  Visual Anthropology Review from 1991 to 1994, and has published Visualizing  Th eory (Routledge, 1994) and Transcultural Cinema, essays by David MacDougall  (Princeton, 1998), and with Barbash, the handbook Cross-Cultural Filmmaking  (California, 1997) and Th e Cinema of Robert Gardner (Berg, 2008); he founded  and heads Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab. Scott MacDonald: Could you each talk a bit about your background: how you got  into film and how you came to work together? In and Out of Afr ica [US, 1993]  was your first film; how did that project develop? And what accounts for the gap  between it and your reentry into filmmaking fift een years later with Sweetgrass? Ilisa Barbash: I grew up loving the movies, but it never really occurred to me that  an ordinary person could make them. When I got out of college I was interested  in journalism, but this was during the arts cable channel boom in New York City,  and it was easier to get a freelance job in television production than it was at a  newspaper. At a certain point I realized that I didn’t want to climb the ladder  to be a small part of a large production organization so I went back to school,  to the master’s program in visual anthropology at the University of Southern  California, where I learned some of the technical skills necessary to be part of a  small film crew. Th ere I met Lucien who was escaping his own insular world in  England. We were part of a cohort of about eleven students, and Lucien and I  started working together. In and Out of Afr ica was our thesis video, a discursive  collage on authenticity, taste, and racial politics in the transnational African art  market. We had originally intended to make a single-channel video about the cultural  eff ects of tourism on the Dogon of Mali. We’d been there a few times and had a  number of contacts, both African and European. But about three months before  we were to shoot, there was a coup d’état in Mali, which of course meant no  tourists. So we shift ed gears. At the time, Lucien was editing the journal Visual  Anthropology Review, and had published an article by a doctoral student, Chris  Steiner, whose dissertation research was on Hausa Muslim art traders in the Ivory  265 </page> <page sequence="7"> Scott MacDonald Coast. We called him up and asked if he knew any who were trading between the  Ivory Coast and New York. Chris introduced us to Gabai Baare in New York and  that summer Chris, Lucien and I met up on the Ivory Coast to film. Of course  there were obvious diff erences between our original and our ultimate project.  But what we were really interested in—exploring the various ways in which  Africans and Europeans/Americans look at each other, the ways in which they  represent themselves to each other and the ways in which they internalize all these  representations—remained the same. Th e gap between In and Out and Sweetgrass was much longer than we’d have  liked. Th e reasons are mundane. Having vowed never to return to academia,  Lucien did a doctorate in anthropology! For that, we lived in Martinique for  two and a half years, during which time we wrote Cross-Cultural Filmmaking and  collaborated with Isaac Julien on the film Frantz Fanon: Black Skin White Mask  [UK, 1996]. We moved twice, because of new jobs, started a family, and wrote and  edited a number of books. I had a six-month battle with head and neck cancer,  which consumed all our energy for a year or more. Each of the films was informed by a long period of reflection and revision,  about what we liked and didn’t like in documentary, what we knew and didn’t  know, and what we thought might be possible. I’m not sure whether we’d have  been able to make Sweetgrass soon aft er making In and Out of Afr ica, even if all the  funding and logistics had been in place. It takes us a long time not just physically  to make a film, but also to be ready to try something new. SM: I’ve seen Sweetgrass in various forms over the past couple of years. You’ve been  working on it for nearly a decade. Could you tell me how this project has evolved? IB: We were living and teaching in Boulder, Colorado, when the project came to  us. Th ere was a New Jersey/Wisconsin newspaper owner, Bill Heaney, who was  leasing land to Lawrence Allestad, the owner of the sheep in the film, at a point  when Lawrence’s deeded land was drying up because of drought and changing  weather patterns. Lawrence would graze this land during fall and spring and then  follow an eighty-plus-year tradition of trailing his sheep up into the Beartooth- Absaroka range near Yellowstone every summer. He had a family permit that  had been passed down over four generations of Norwegian descendants. One  day the sheep owner said to the land owner, “Th is is the last time I’m ever going  to do this; someone should make a film about me,” and word traveled, eventually  to us in March of 2001, and we thought it sounded like a wonderful project. We  had small children so we didn’t want to travel very far. Th at summer, we went up  through Wyoming to Montana with the family and a babysitter and her dog, and  started shooting. 266 </page> <page sequence="8"> Interviews Lucien Castaing-Taylor: As Lisa said, we were living in the Rockies and were interested  in the so-called New West (the wunderkind scholar Patti Limerick was a col- league in Boulder), especially the changes wrought by yuppification, with all the  neo-homesteaders—rich hobby farmers—moving in and buying up the land as a  playground for their kids and guests for a few weeks every summer. It was a chance,  or a challenge, for us to engage anew with “salvage ethnography”—how to repre- sent a world on the wane—something that’s been considered totally retrograde  within anthropology since the 1960s. Could we acknowledge a historical loss  without falling prey to all the pitfalls of patronizing romanticism and nostalgia? SM: When you say that the tradition of salvage ethnography has been intellectually  discredited, to what extent do you feel that that negates the value of the films of  crucial contributors to cinematic salvage ethnography like John Marshall and  Robert Gardner? LC-T: Maybe it does negate their value. But is that all wrong? Th ey remained com- mitted to visual salvage anthropology long aft er written anthropology, critical  theory, and art practice more generally had moved on and turned their attention  to hybridizing, globalizing cultural formations in various states of emergence  and becoming. Marshall’s early sequence films among the !Kung are still remarkable when  I watch them today, not least for their unselfconscious structural rigor in a  filmmaker who never, to my knowledge, had any interest in the avant-garde—as  is the mythopoetic Hunters [US, 1958], in a totally diff erent register. A Joking  Relationship [US, 1962] is extraordinary in its coupling of the erotic and the  ethnographic. But Marshall was an uneven cinematographer and a rather sloppy  filmmaker. His magnum opus, A Kalahari Family [US, 2001], is all over the place,  stylistically and substantively. SM: In the early 1970s, I had the good fortune to take a one-week intensive course  on ethnographic film from Marshall (for several years the University Film Associa- tion sponsored summer courses at Hampshire College); to my surprise, he opened  that course with Peter Kubelka’s flicker film, Arnulf Rainer [AT, 1960]. He did  have some awareness of avant-garde filmmaking. And Gardner? LC-T: Gardner lost interest in anthropology early on and has never really done  ethnographic fieldwork of his own, but in a typical cinematic division of labor,  has borrowed from the anthropological expertise of others—among the Dani, the  Hamar, the Wodaabe, and also in Benares. His one masterpiece, for me, is Forest  267 </page> <page sequence="9"> Scott MacDonald of Bliss [US, 1986], and I doubt it will seem any less of an achievement a century  from now. But the anachronistic discourse of Dead Birds [US, 1963] and its divine  cinematographic omniscience—if not falling afoul of the pathetic fallacy, then  at least exemplifying a kind of pathetic infallibility—has been an embarrassment  to anthropologists for decades. Th e purple prose voice-over imprisons the Dani  within some sublimated, dehistoricized, deeply racialized Stone Age formalde- hyde that was concocted in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Even Gardner’s later Deep  Hearts [US, 1979] and the cinematographically mind-blowing Rivers of Sand [US,  1974] display almost no evidence of modernity or of any coevality between the  Hamar, the Peul, and their imagined spectators. IB: I disagree. I don’t think those developments you mentioned negate the value of  these films at all. Certainly the Marshall family was aware that they were filming  a world on the wane and were careful not to film things like Coke bottles (a la  Th e Gods Must be Crazy [South Africa, 1980]) in their work. In retrospect, we  can criticize them for not being more upfront about their subject positions and  the eff ect of their presence on these communities in their 1950s—1970s films and  ethnographies. But that’s applying contemporary standards to work done fift y-odd  years go. And since then, John, Lorna and Elizabeth Marshall have acknowledged  the changes in the lives of the !Kung that were occurring as they did their research;  John, especially in his Kalahari Family series. Nobody sees these films outside of a classroom any more, and there they  remain valuable approximations of what life was like for hunter-gatherers in the  1950s. Were the !Kung “untouched” when the Marshalls arrived? No. Are these  real !Kung in their films? Yes. Is this pretty close to what their lives were like?  Probably. What’s delighted me about anthropology since I first started studying it  is that at least since the mid-1980s we’ve learned that we can’t look at any kind  of representation without being critical of it, and without second-guessing the  ideological inclinations and personal motivations, conscious and unconscious,  of the author of the ethnography. I’m not sure every other discipline reflects on  itself to the same degree. A close examination of the work of Gardner taught me this as well as anything  else: that a work of ethnography emerges from the originating culture, that of the  filmmaker, and is inevitably a product of its time. If you are looking for a single  truth, you are not going to find it in one of Gardner’s films. But that doesn’t mean  you’re not going to get anything of value from that representation. SM: Sweetgrass is not the only film to come out of your sheepherding project. 268 </page> <page sequence="10"> Interviews LC-T: No. Actually, it’s the ninth piece, but it’s the longest, and the one Lisa and  I made together. I’m finishing the others now, but unlike Sweetgrass they’re  intended more for gallery exhibition than theatrical. Originally we imagined we  were shooting a single vérité documentary about these sheepherders’ lives. We  ended up becoming so engrossed that we, all of us as a family, spent three sum- mers there. I was on a sabbatical during this period, so during 2001–2002 I was  spending three or four days out of every week or two, year round, up there—all  the winter sequences, the shearing and the lambing, were shot during that time.  We shot in Montana between 2001 and 2007, but far more intensively in the early  years before we moved to Boston. Had we not moved east, we’d probably still be  shooting. Why stop? IB: Th e majority of the footage you see in Sweetgrass was shot that first sum- mer—the whole trajectory of going up into the mountains and coming back  down. In retrospect, this surprises me because you would think that as you  get to know people better, you’re going to get more interesting, more intimate  footage. Instead, what happened was that, summer by summer, we had to work  harder to get good footage. Lucien shot much more the first summer than he  did the second two summers, though the footage he shot later did help us fill  in some gaps. Also, over the three summers the hired hands working with the sheep  changed, and that made it difficult to integrate the three years. Th e first summer’s  footage had John and Pat, the two herders you get to know in the film; during the  second summer Pat worked with someone else and was becoming discouraged  with the whole sheepherding endeavor. He was exhausted, homesick, had a  girlfriend back home he missed, and was doing the bulk of the work himself. Th at’s  when he went up to the top of the mountain and complained to his mother that  he just couldn’t handle it anymore. So that sequence is from the second summer.  Th ere’s almost nothing in the film from the third summer. All of the stuff  from  other seasons, all the birthing and shearing and the hay being spewed out onto the  landscape, was shot between the first summer and the second summer. SM: How oft en did you need to have the herders, or others, reenact things they did? LC-T: I don’t think we staged anything. We didn’t interview anybody either, at  least when the camera was rolling—though when I wasn’t shooting I probably  drove them spare with my asinine questions. But it would have been antithetical  to both the aesthetics and the ethics we were aft er to have asked anyone to reenact  anything just for the camera. Sometimes something happened and I missed it and I  269 </page> <page sequence="11"> Scott MacDonald would pray that they would do it again—invariably in vain—but we never directed  action, even in cases where it could conceivably look as if we did. IB: Th e one scene for which we most prepared was the shot of the sheep going  through town. For that we had two cameras going the first year. I was on the roof of  a Land Rover shooting down the street from above, and Lucien was on the ground  shooting tracking shots. I focused way down the street toward the railroad tracks  to catch the sheep coming up onto the horizon and crossing the tracks. As it was  a super long shot, it seemed to take forever. And then as the sheep came closer I  spied Lucien in the corner of the frame, wearing his harness, walking and shooting  alongside Lawrence. Of course we could not do a re-shoot with three thousand  sheep in the middle of town! Jump cut to the next summer. Again on or around  July 5 we got up at 4:30 in the morning, got both cameras ready, quickly drove to  the center of town to set up the shot, and then I realized that in our rush, I had  forgotten my camera! Lucien filmed down from the Land Rover roof and that’s  the shot in the film. SM: What was your relationship with the herders; they seem amazingly at ease  around you, and yet, you must be kneeling on the ground right in front of them  as you’re filming. Th ey do mention you once when you’re in the tent at one point;  and at the end of the phone call scene, Pat seems to talk to you about his “phone  booth,” but generally your presence is not remarked by John and Pat. LC-T: Th ere’s a weird moment when we’re all in the cook tent. Aft er you hear a  snore, John says to Pat that he has made it so hot in the tent that “Lucien fell  asleep.” Technically, even epistemologically, that’s so bizarre as to be borderline  incomprehensible. It’s definitely thought-provoking. How can the camera opera- tor have fallen asleep? Well, as it happens, I really had, but the camera was on my  lap and my right hand was still on the handle, and the camera was just mindlessly  rolling on, recording away. It’s a reflexive moment, but not your garden-variety  documentary mise-en-abîme. Another moment that bowls me over is right aft er Pat’s phone conversation  with his mother, when his cell battery gives out. He turns to me and says “I love to  torment her.” Th at remark speaks volumes, and you immediately have to rethink  the whole sequence you’ve just seen. Was his vulnerability before his mother not  genuine? Was he hamming it up for attention, and if so, hers, on the end of the  line, or mine, behind the camera? Or is he making light of it to cloak his vulner- ability? I rather think the latter, which only adds more pathos to the scene. Th ere  are various other moments when I’m acknowledged, explicitly or implicitly, but  you’re right that, stylistically, we chose not to belabor them. 270 </page> <page sequence="12"> Interviews Most of our subjects knew each other well, which aff ected how comfortable  they were around the camera. And being at eleven or twelve thousand feet in the  mountains for two-three months, looking aft er three thousand sheep, controlling  where they graze and trying to protect them from predators, tending camp day  in day out, with nobody but two guys and the animals to talk to, it’s amazing how  quickly you get intimate. We had extended conversations about Uncle Snooks and  Aunt Edna; John and Pat mapped their conjugal relations; I would tell them about  growing up in Liverpool and life in Europe—there were some fantastic conversa- tions that didn’t get into Sweetgrass. Pat and I are about the same age, and have  kids the same age, but I was a foreigner who had never even set foot in Montana  before starting this project; John is maybe twenty years older, has spent more time  herding sheep, and is a Vietnam Vet. We had more than enough to talk about. I think a number of things contributed to their apparent indiff erence to the  camera. One is that when I wasn’t filming, when I didn’t have the camera on me,  I was working as they were, or at least trying to help out as best I could. I was a  greenhorn; I didn’t know sheep, had never ridden a horse before, and so on—so  I was their apprentice in many ways. Obviously I had to learn fast. But I was  not only a greenhorn, I was a foreigner, and had a funny, barely comprehensible  British accent. I must have seemed like an alien to them, and my project might  have seemed as alien as I was. I remember when I first went out there, during lambing in 2001, before we’d  met: I was on the phone with Lawrence Allestad, the rancher who owns the sheep  and the grazing allotment, and I could tell he wasn’t understanding a word I was  saying. Finally he said, “Hold on a second, I’ll get my wife; she speaks English. I’m  a ‘Wegian.” Since the second world war, rural Montanans of Norwegian descent  have felt more and more displaced by political-economic developments, as their  family-oriented ranching culture has withered away; and they have sometimes  internalized a sense of their own inferiority. It’s terribly sad when a culture or  subculture that perceived itself as the center of its own universe gets progressively  marginalized. One of the later scenes to end up on the cutting room floor was a  story about a ‘Wegian kid who believed it was illegal for ‘Wegians to go to college. Also, the camera was a gargantuan shoulder-mounted monstrosity that was  suspended from a spring and aluminum bar that came up my spine and extended  over my head—to help lower the center of gravity and take some of the pressure  off  my arms. It cut off  180 degrees of my vision and blocked out half my face. And  because I almost never lowered it from my shoulder, even when eating around  the fire or herding the sheep, it became almost a prosthetic extension of my body,  and I, I suppose, a kind of cyborg. Paradoxically, because it was so visible, with no  possibility of dissimulation, the camera became part of the fabric of our daily lives  and everyone tended to ignore it. 271 </page> <page sequence="13"> Scott MacDonald Contrary to what you’d expect, the eff ect is almost the inverse of what hap- pens with small home video cameras, especially now that they have fold-out LCD  screens—you can tell immediately whether these new cameras are recording or  not, which results in this self-conscious performativity on the part of subjects. We  were mostly interested in ways our subjects would reveal dimensions of themselves  when they weren’t explicitly or exclusively acting out for the camera. IB: Th e Montanans we worked with are used to going on trail-riding expeditions  and hunts with East Coast dudes, and they make fun of how lame they are. I think  the fact that Lucien walked up the mountain, for the most part holding an incred- ibly heavy camera, while other people were riding, was a kind of endurance test  that he passed quite well; they could see that he was not some wimpy East Coaster. LC-T: I don’t know about that. Another thing is that when I did have the camera on me and was shooting, I  wouldn’t interact with them; I wouldn’t answer any questions or talk. Because they  knew that I was working in my own way, and because they had a respect for work,  they would stop trying to interact with me. If we were bedding the sheep down or  something, we’d exchange a minimum of information through the walkie-talkies  we all carried—which ended up being acoustically prominent in the sound track  of Sweetgrass—but they soon realized I wasn’t very good company when I was  holding the camera. SM: One thing that troubles me about Sweetgrass is a technological issue. When I  saw the blow-up to 35mm at the Flaherty seminar and again at the New York Film  Festival, the most epic landscape shots oft en seemed to break down a bit. I didn’t  notice this when I originally saw the material on DVD before the blow-up, and I  assume this is a function of the limitations of the video technology you had in the  early 2000s. Could you talk about your struggles to get this film looking its best? LC-T: You’re such a snob. But I agree, it was unwatchable in Alice Tully Hall. Th e  screen is too large, and it’s also a multipurpose space, with red lights from the aisles  shining on the screen. Incredible! But it looked fantastic at Film Forum, where  the cinema screens are probably smaller than some people’s private plasma screens  on the Upper East Side. What can I say? We had no money. With our kind of  uncontrolled, unscripted methodology, we knew we’d end up with a high shoot- ing ratio. We had no choice but to shoot it on standard-definition ntsc digital  video. We used three cameras, but almost all of it was shot on a 32⁄3" ccd dvcam,  a really excellent model that no student today would touch with a 10-foot barge  pole. “Standard” definition video has 480 lines of horizontal resolution—actually  272 </page> <page sequence="14"> Interviews two interlaced fields of 243 lines. “High” definition, which wasn’t yet available,  has 720, 1080, or more. Blowing up a standard def ntsc signal to 35mm is never straightforward.  Pedro Costa’s Lisbon trilogy, and a number of his other works, were shot on  pal dv, which is superior to ntsc, but still a far cry from the equivalent native  resolution of analog 35mm film, which is usually reckoned as somewhere around  15,000–18,000 pixels. Costa is oft en shooting in low light, with very high contrast  ratios, yet his work looks out of this world. He told me about his colorist, Patrick  Lindenmaier, who’s based in Zurich, and has hand-built the most advanced digital- to-film transfer facilities in the world. I sent Patrick a rough cut of Sweetgrass on  DVD, and when he saw the shot of the newly shorn sheep shivering in the snow,  he agreed to work with us, but warned us that he could only do so much. To the  extent that Sweetgrass is watchable at all is in large part due to his eff orts. We spent  two long weeks in Zurich and Bern doing final post-production and film-out.  But when Sweetgrass premiered in Berlin, on the largest screen in that obscene  shrine to unfettered post-unification global capital, Potsdamer Platz, I looked  at Patrick halfway through the screening, and he had his head in his hands, eyes  averted from the screen. Even 35mm film resolution doesn’t hold up at that size.  Big Sky is God’s country, and it wasn’t made to be rendered on standard def. But  beggars can’t be choosers. IB: I would add that I don’t think that anyone with a 35mm camera rig would have  gotten up into these mountains and been able to film all that went on, so from the  get-go it was obvious that there would be some technical compromises. SM: Lucien, I’ve heard you say that Sweetgrass is more interested in the sheep than  the humans. Could you talk about this? LC-T: Oh, I don’t know. I don’t trust anything I say about the film. Th e other day at  a Q and A aft er a screening, I even found myself reciting something from a review  as if it was my own take on the film! If we could say in words what the film—our  collaborator Ernst Karel prefers “vilm,” as an umbrella term to encompass video  and film, by analogy with “photograph,” which doesn’t discriminate against  digital or analog—if we could say in words what the vilm is about, we wouldn’t  have had to make it. But I think Sweetgrass is interested in both the sheep and the people, or  more precisely their intertwined naturecultures within the context of their larger  ecological fold. Sheep and humans have existed uneasily with each other since  we first domesticated them in Mesopotamia ten-thousand-odd years ago in the  Neolithic Revolution; they were quite possibly the first domesticated livestock  273 </page> <page sequence="15"> Scott MacDonald animal in history. Th ey gave humanity our first staple proteins: milk and meat. Not  to mention their skins, for shelter—and a couple of thousand years later, also their  wool. Th ey wouldn’t exist without us, and couldn’t survive without us, because of  the way we’ve bred them (to maximize both birth weight and the number of live  births) over the millennia. So I don’t think you can distinguish between “people”  and “sheep.” It’s more that we’re so many variations of “sheeple.” But it’s true that while we started off  more interested in the herders, and  their relationships to their animals and the land, I do feel the sheep crept up on  us and in a way stole the film. I hadn’t given much thought to the aesthetics of  sheep before, never mind their lifeworld, the phenomenology of sheep. Come to  think of it, the Christian iconography of lambs and sheep ( Jacob, David, Isaac,  Abraham, Moses, and of course Mohammed, were all shepherds, don’t forget)  had probably inured me to sheep as a subject. But it’s hard not to spend countless  hours herding and filming them in the back of beyond without starting to think  about their subjectivities, and also of course their objectivities—their appearance.  I find their bodies fascinating just to look at. Western thought from the Greeks on, and especially aft er Descartes, has been  hell bent on setting humanity apart from animalia. Linnaeus was the one excep- tion—as he put it in his Systema naturae in reference to the Cartesian conception  of animals as so many soulless automata mechanica, “Cartesius certe non vidit  simios.” Evidently Descartes never saw a monkey! Linnaeus was dead right. Th e  same has held true ever since, from Heidegger, for whom animals inhabited an  “environment,” but never a “Welt,” a world, through Benjamin, Levinas, Lacan,  even Derrida—who tried harder than anyone to turn the theoretical tables on the  human/animal dyad in his last book, L’animal que donc je suis, but failed miserably.  His eff orts to extend any ontological density to animalia never went any further  than the disquiet he felt before his cat—his chatte, his pussy, as he insists—as she  beheld his limp bitte in his Parisian apartment. In any event, in some way Sweetgrass does seek to anthropomorphize sheep,  and simultaneously to bestialize humanity. I think Dewey was dead right in his  1934 Art as Experience where he insisted that the best art recouples us with our  base, bestial selves, and yokes culture back to nature, and the human to the live  animal. Most social theory now supposes that “nature” is just some secondary  elaboration, a cultural construction—Bruno Latour has argued that the concept  of nature has been co-opted by the singular authoritative voice of capital-S Sci- ence and should therefore be abolished altogether—but that’s pure poppycock,  postmodernism of the most parochial kind. IB: I’d like to propose that the dogs are the unsung heroes and heroines of the film.  Th ey function on all sorts of levels: as real helpmates, as physical extensions of the  274 </page> <page sequence="16"> Interviews herders, and as their psychological mirrors. Th ere are at least two kinds of dogs  in the film. Th ere are the herders—Border collies. Th ey’re working dogs but are  like pets, played with, and have names: Coco, Breck, Tommy dog, Lena, and my  favorite, Maybe. Th ey take commands, as many as two in order. And they can be  directed to round up masses of sheep, corral strays, push a herd forward. Th ese  dogs seem to function as emotional extensions of the people. When all is chaotic,  Lena seems to be running out of control. Breck won’t follow John the way he  would like. When Pat is at the end of his tether, Tommy dog needs an aff ectionate  pat and a drink of water. Th en there are the big white dogs, five Great Pyrenees and one Turkish  Akbash. Th ese are the guard dogs. Th ey are raised with the sheep and are not  treated like pets. Th ey don’t have names; in many ways, they’re almost feral. Th ey  live and sleep with the sheep, and will protect them as long as the sheep are alive  and healthy. In fact, you may notice that they even allow the sheep to push them  around a bit. Th ey will fight to the death defending their flock against a bear. But  right aft er the cell phone call, when we know that things are falling apart, we see  the white dogs snarling at each other, tearing apart the carcass of a sheep. Th ey’re  always hungry, and the moment one of their charges is dead, well, she becomes  meat. Th ey reflect the dramatic, and now very dark, tenor of the film. Th ey remind  me of the three old witches at the beginning of Macbeth: “Fair is foul, and foul is  fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.” SM: In what ways did your thinking about humans and animals aff ect the structur- ing of Sweetgrass? LC-T: In both filming and later editing Sweetgrass, we became more and more  invested in nature, both our identity within it and our experience of it. It’s no  accident that the film begins in the domain of the sheep, and humans enter  the fray only later and gradually. One of the most trenchant qualities invoked  by philosophers and anthropologists as evidence of our separation from the  animal kingdom has been our putative monopoly of language, which is why,  when humans eventually do appear in Sweetgrass, they do so largely nonverbally.  Other than AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” lyrics, which I worry are read as overtly  allegorical, or as editorializing on our part, there are no intelligible spoken words  during the shearing sequence. Th e first spoken human word in Sweetgrass is the call of the shepherd trying  to get the sheep to follow him into the shearing pen. He yells something unintel- ligible to nonlocals; it sounds like “kumbudday.” When I first heard this, I asked  what it meant. Th e Norwegians told me it was a bastardization of old Norwegian  that their grandparent homesteaders had brought with them. Th e local Irish  275 </page> <page sequence="17"> Scott MacDonald thought it was a corruption of “Come Paddy!” In fact they were both wrong. In  certain valleys in the south of England in Stuart and Tudor days, when you let  your ducks out of their coop in the morning, you would call for them to follow  you so you could feed them grain, “Coom biddy, coom biddy.” It’s a contraction  of “Come, I bid thee!” So to my knowledge these twenty-first-century Montanans  are the last people on earth to speak this Stuart and Tudor vernacular (I’ve  certainly never heard any rural Brits use it). Th e next human enunciation in Sweetgrass is in my favorite, and the longest,  shot of the movie—when the woman in the night lambing shed is trying to coax  the ewe to acknowledge and follow its lamb into a “jug,” a pen. She’s mimicking  the sound of the lamb, and if you’re not a sheep person, you probably can’t be  sure in this shot which sounds are ovine and which human. Mimicry of course is  behind all communication and is a much more profound form of commensality  than propositional language. So here we have proto-language, uttered by a human  imitating an animal, but we’re still delaying the introduction of language per se. It’s interesting how slowly these “ideas,” or idea-images, if that is what they are,  came to us. While nature loomed ever larger in my mind, not to mention my body,  as we were filming, the structure of the film, which now seems so self-evident and  conventional—basically just reflecting the narrative of the sheep drive to and from  the mountains, as if it were somehow naturally secreted by the journey itself—was  only created right at the end of editing. Originally all the snow footage that you  see at the beginning, the sheep eating the cake, the unraveling of the hay bale, the  shearing, came at the end. We wanted to end the film back in the domain of the  sheep, relegating humanity to the periphery, beyond figure, and even beyond  ground. But very late in the editing we shift ed that material to the beginning. Aft er  the release of the journey down the mountain and the semi-closure of the train  tracks and stock yards, it seemed too grueling for the spectator to be submitted  to the shearing. But this then left  us ending on John and the other guy driving away in the  pick-up, which was initially very hard for me to be reconciled to—ending on  humans, I mean, the obsessive subject of cinema since its invention—aft er all  we had done to try to relativize them and relocate them within a larger matrix  of nature. And it seemed to hint at a kind of closure that was both specious (the  humans’ future is in fact so uncertain, totally open-ended) and clichéd. But, by  extending the shot for as long as possible, and thereby minimizing the significance  of the already laconic dialogue in it, and then by extending it acoustically for as  long again aft er the hard cut to black, I came around to it. And it was important that aft er the main credits we return to the mountains,  the view of the Beartooths from the Absarokas, but with a totally diff erent  soundscape: it’s fall, elk are bugling (an eerie sound that most city folks can’t  276 </page> <page sequence="18"> Interviews identify), the domesticated animals are gone, the humans are gone. In a sense,  nature has returned. SM: Did the route of the seasonal migration take you into Yellowstone National  Park? Pat brings the environmentalist issue up when he and John are talking about  the “problem bears” that are not afraid of humans. Did the environmental issue  play into the demise of this sheep migration? LC-T: Yes and no. Th e grazing permits in the area date back to the early part of  the twentieth century, long aft er the park was established back in 1872, and were  for Bureau of Land Management and National Forest lands just to the north. In  1975, the area was designated a federal “Wilderness” area (preserves of putative  “wildness” that, etymologically, impose their extra-human “will” on you), which  prohibits all “development,” and since then the forest service, under pressure from  various self-identified “environmentalist” constituencies, has sought to phase out  all herding allotments. Th e Allestads’ was the last grazing permit to go. Th ey will tell you it was because of pressure from environmentalists, and that’s  half true. But it was also economic and cultural. Th is kind of transhumance is  extraordinarily labor-intensive and costly. As a system, capitalism will substitute  commodities for people and machines for people’s labor whenever and wherever it  can. And it can on ranches, down on the plains. For the cost of a new pick-up, you  could probably pay the salary of three or four old-time hired hands. Every rancher  I know would prefer the pick-up. But you can’t get pick-ups into the mountains.  And finding qualified help to herd sheep and defend them (and yourself ) against  protected predators like grizzly bears and the reintroduced gray wolf, is no easy feat. In Breakfast [US, 2010], one of the installation pieces that came out of this  project, Pat casually lets slip his contempt for “backpackers, granolas, and envi- ronmentalists.” Th e words just slide out of his mouth, almost unthinkingly, and  virtually devoid of aff ect. It’s an amazing line, there’s a whole worldview contained  within it, and a whole unwritten history of dispossession of rural folk by educated  urbanites patronizing them about how to be proper custodians of the land. IB: Even while we were in Big Timber, they had already started dealing with other  kinds of environmental issues with perhaps more significant consequences. Th e  Stillwater Mining company had recently opened up a new corridor into the  U.S.’s only palladium and platinum mine. Some of the people in our film worked  there—Pat’s brother-in-law for example—in four twelve-hour shift s a week. In  2001, I filmed a town meeting called to discuss the mine, but it didn’t make it into  the final cut. Th e people who attended seemed pretty divided about the impact  of the mine on their town. While some of the year-round Big Timber population  277 </page> <page sequence="19"> Scott MacDonald saw the employment benefits of the mine, others were concerned about the  eff ect of drainage from the mines going into the Boulder River and changing its  temperature and chemistry. And there were also people worried about the social  and economic impact of suddenly adding new families to the local area. When  we were there, they had to hastily attach some modular classrooms to the schools.  By 2008, the mine was the county’s largest employer and paid about 40 percent  of the county’s tax revenue, and when they started to lay people off  because of a  mining bust, it hit the community hard. Th e mine has had other problems more  recently during the downturn in the auto industry as the metals it produces are  used in vehicle catalytic converters to screen out auto pollution, of all things. SM: Your use of sound is fascinating, not just because of the sounds of the sheep,  but because of the way the soundscape of the film is constructed. For example, in  a considerable number of scenes we’re hearing in close-up, sometimes in extreme  close-up, as we’re seeing in long shot, even extreme long shot. Could you talk about  how you did this and what led to this approach? Th e only place I can remember  a similar use of sound and image is at the beginning of Abbas Kiarostami’s Th e  Wind Will Carry Us [IR, 1999]. IB: Th e discrepancy between what you hear and what you think you should hear  in sync with an image emerged in the editing room rather than being planned.  Initially, we just wanted to get the best sound possible, and it was clear that we had  to do that with radio microphones. As we edited we had to think about which  sounds we’d privilege and then these odd pairings began to emerge, but Lucien  can speak more to the actual recording process. LC-T: When I was recording up in the mountains, I would put up to eight wireless  mics on people—and occasionally on a horse, a dog, or a sheep, but the mics were  expensive, and the cables would easily tear, so we couldn’t aff ord that as much as  we’d have liked. I think we ended up spending more money on mics than we did  on the camera. I could only record four tracks at any one time, two through the  camera and two through a tape recorder, so I would be listening through head- phones to the diff erent sound sources and deciding which to plug in and record.  My experience of being high in the mountains, with these incredible views, but of  listening all the while to these sound sources had a huge eff ect on the final film. In  the first place, because lavaliere mics are so close to the sound source, they result in  this very subjective, guttural, highly embodied sound. Roland Barthes spoke not  of the mouth, but of the animalic muzzle—the museau, not the bouche, or even the  gueule—and I thought a lot about what he meant when I was recording the sound. If we succeed in adequately bestializing humanity in Sweetgrass, I’d guess it’s  278 </page> <page sequence="20"> Interviews in large part due to the sound. Exclamations, heavy breathing, non-propositional  fragments of language half mumbled under someone’s breath, tailing off  into song  or a cough or a cry. Th is is how we speak, these are the sounds we all make. But  documentary has almost entirely turned a deaf ear to them. Also, documentary  conventions of naturalism are such that acoustical and optical perspective are  generally made to appear to be one and the same. If someone is close to the camera  they should sound close; if they’re far away, they should sound far away. Fiction  films are not nearly so literal-minded, and with wireless lavaliere mics, sources  always sound close, because they are close, not to the receiver, but to the mic  feeding the transmitter. When we were editing, the aesthetic tension between the  perspective and spatiality of the sound and picture really came to the fore, and we  oft en tried to push the discrepancy as far as we could. Th e danger of a  lavaliere mic is, of course, twofold: you privilege speech over  other kinds of sound, which is probably documentary’s greatest failing, and you  collapse the space. But we wanted to combine the intimacy of the eavesdropping  the lavs allowed us with the monumental magnitude of the mountains, oft en  filmed with long lenses, compressing and pictorializing and in a sense de-realizing  the space. One other quality of recording with so many lavs that jumped out at  me while shooting was the absurd, oft en completely surreal synchronicities that  would result. Th e transmitters we used were 250 millawatt, the most powerful  that are legal in the U.S., which would transmit a signal to me from up to a mile  and a half away. So I could be simultaneously recording with four lavs up to three  miles away from each other, none of which might suggest anything whatsoever  in common with what the camera was recording through its lens. Other times,  when I’d hear something interesting through a lav, I’d see if I could locate where  it was, and try to turn the camera onto it—like the shot of John riding along the  horizon bedding his “girlies” down in the lullaby sequence, singing a ditty to his  horse and himself. SM: Was everything shot in sync? LC-T: A few times we moved a word or two a few seconds one way or another so  it would be intelligible, but basically all the speech is sync. At times, though, we  really wanted people to wonder whether the sound was sync or not. For example,  during the first nighttime scene, above the timberline, up in the basins—what we  call the lullaby scene—it’s getting dark and John goes into a kind of reverie as he  tries to round the sheep up and get them to settle on the bed ground next to his  tipi for the night. He has to go all the way around the band to get the sheep close  enough to give him a chance of protecting them from bears and wolves; and so  he rides up to the horizon. 279 </page> <page sequence="21"> Scott MacDonald Th e scene is almost surreal because, even when John is perhaps three-quarters  of a mile away from the camera, his lovely, subjective, guttural voice gets recorded  and feels very intimate. A litany of “girly, girlies,” almost a soliloquy, gently cascades  from his mouth, and then he starts singing these half-remembered fragments of  old-time Western songs. And when he and his horse ride along the horizon, you  feel like you’re being subjected to a classic, over-mythologized Western stereo- type—it’s almost too good to be true. It’s such a cliché that you might doubt the  nonfiction status of the image. At the very least, you lose confidence for a moment  in the filmmaker for peddling you a corny stereotype of the cowboy. But when he  breaks from his song, halfway along the horizon, to bark “Get back, Breck!” at  his dog, and you faintly make out his dog before him, it clicks, and you know, as  impossible as it may seem, that this was being recorded in sync. Th ere are quite a  few moments like that scattered throughout. Th e sound was edited and mixed by Ernst Karel, an experimental musician,  phonographer, sound artist—even an anthropologist. A jack-of-all-trades. He  designed a highly orchestrated multitrack soundscape that layered many diff erent  kinds of sounds, especially of ambience and of the sheep. My own on-camera  mono microphone couldn’t begin to do justice to the vastness of mountain  acoustics. He eventually mixed his composition down into two versions, a 5.1  surround sound mix for the Dolby SRD, and a stereo version for the analog optical  track. I’m almost completely tone deaf, so it was a godsend to find him. SM: Your end credits say “Produced by Ilisa Barbash” and “Recorded by Lucien  Castaing-Taylor.” Lisa, I’d be interested in knowing what was involved in produc- ing the film. And, Lucien, why the unusual “Recorded by”? You both have editing  credit, but no one is listed as director or filmmaker. IB: I’m not entirely comfortable with dividing up the credits in this way. I think  elaborate titles make more sense when there is a larger crew and a need to make  sure the division of labor is clear, and that the credit for doing various kinds  of work is evident. I’d say that we’re both the filmmakers, and I’d almost have  been happy leaving it at that. We both conceived of the film, edited it, and both  produced it, and dealt with all the production logistics. But Lucien did more,  having shot all of footage that ended up in this film, and he directed himself as a  cameraman. No one directed the participants, except perhaps the ranch owner,  Lawrence Allestad! LC-T: “Directed” just seems all wrong. We’re not out to disavow our agency or  anything, but what or who did we direct? We never interviewed anyone. We  never told anyone what to do, or to do anything again, however much I sometimes  280 </page> <page sequence="22"> Interviews wished they would. I was a parasite, along for the ride. Anything that made it into  the film did so through contingency, happenstance, serendipity. Cinéma vérité, at  its best, works through a unique combination of anticipation and accident, and  although our engagement with aesthetics is very unlike vérité’s—remember the  old quip that vérité makes up in immediacy what it lacks in appearance?—our  renunciation of directorial control rendered us dependent on the accidental and  correspondingly elevated the importance of our capacity to anticipate action  before it happened. Our only “direction” was unwitting, when I got in the way, especially in the  early weeks, trying to get the camera angle I wanted and turning the sheep back  from a gate, or, if I was leading the sheep through the timber when trailing into  the mountains, going the wrong way and causing a wreck. Maybe it should say  “De-rected by.” “Directed by” smacks of a documentary inferiority complex,  fiction-film envy, what have you. It’s both epistemologically dubious and ethically  duplicitous. SM: I wonder how much you were thinking of particular Westerns—Red River  [Howard Hawks, US, 1948], for example—as you shot or edited Sweetgrass. IB: I grew up watching Gunsmoke [CBS, US, 1955–75] and Bonanza [NBC, US,  1959–73], and when I first met the people who ended up in Sweetgrass, they  reminded me of characters from these shows, and from Western movies I had  seen. Pat’s intonation, for example, always reminds me of John Wayne. One of  the characters has a brother whose nickname is Festus, as in Gunsmoke. When we  started this project I bought a whole bunch of DVDs of Westerns, and we kept  intending to watch them, but ended up not doing that kind of homework. What’s  interesting to me is how accurately in some ways and how inaccurately in others  Hollywood has portrayed the West. Our film confirms some of what you see in  Hollywood Westerns and perhaps corrects other things. Th e people in Sweetgrass really do wear cowboy hats. $350 a shot, pure beaver  pelt. One of them came to visit us and wore his cowboy hat on the T and in Sever  Hall at Harvard; all the groomsmen wore cowboy hats at his wedding. On the  other hand, the people we filmed were really good at riding four-wheelers (oft en  just on two wheels) and at using cell phones and communicating by walkie-talkie,  so in a way, Sweetgrass is meant to show you what the Old West has become. But  I definitely meant for our film to refer back to films like Red River, though we  weren’t informed by Red River in particular. LC-T: I grew up in Liverpool, in the northwest of England, a post-industrial detritus  of a city. We didn’t have television at home, and we never went to the movies.  281 </page> <page sequence="23"> Scott MacDonald I’ve never seen Red River, though Lisa’s told me about it; I’ve seen hardly any  Westerns. In fact, when it comes to cinema, I’m pretty illiterate. I don’t really like  movies, to be honest: most are so audiovisually intrusive that I resent them. All  about spectacle and distraction. Literature at once gives freer rein to and intrudes  less on your imagination. It’s less sensorially stimulating and less coercive—seems  more intellectually democratic somehow. SM: Brokeback Mountain [Ang Lee, US, 2005] came out during the time when  you were working on this project; I confess I’ve sometimes described Sweetgrass  to people as “Brokeback Mountain without the sex”! What are your thoughts on  the Ang Lee film—its early sequence of sheepherding is much less intimate than  yours, but it’s spectacular in its own way. Did the herders you worked with have  a reaction to Brokeback? IB: I was probably the only person in the audience who watched Brokeback think- ing, “Oh, no, don’t cut to Jake Gyllenhaal, the sheep are about to do something  really interesting.” Of course, Brokeback was shot in a beautiful setting (British  Columbia), but I really did feel that a lot of the beauty of the landscape and  motion of the sheep were neglected for the story. Understandably so. I’ve heard that Ang Lee had to make some compromises with Brokeback  Mountain—that 90 percent of the film was shot within seventy feet of a road, and  they couldn’t wrangle enough real life sheep to go the right way and so they tripled  them in digital re-creations. We had a much more cooperative cast. LC-T: Brokeback was pure spectacle, and a total melodrama, quite the contrary of  the restraint and subtlety of Annie Proux’s minimalist prose. Th e performances  redeemed it, especially the wives. But I don’t think I know anyone in Montana  who actually saw the film. SM: You’ve described the sheepherding project as salvage ethnography, which in  many senses it is, of course; but sometimes it seems as close to James Benning’s  films and the work of other avant-garde filmmakers, as to traditional documen- taries. In Sweetgrass what is normally thought of as avant-garde film history  and documentary history seem to merge. Did your working in Boulder have an  impact on the way you think of yourselves as filmmakers? Stan Brakhage and Phil  Solomon are thanked in the end credits. IB: At every point during the editing, because of our anthropological training, we,  or at least I, thought about both ethnography and aesthetics, or art; and when the  two concerns didn’t seem to mesh, we’d incline one way or the other. I don’t think  282 </page> <page sequence="24"> Interviews we put our chips in one particular camp. I do think we could have made the film  more “ethnographic” if we had provided more information within the film. A  friend of ours showed a film of his to Cliff ord Geertz, an eminent anthropologist,  and Geertz’s response was something like, “Well, how many people lived in that  village? Your film doesn’t even show me that.” We could have told you how many  people lived in Big Timber; at the very beginning, we could have explained that  this was the last sheep drive, but we decided not to impart information in what  felt was an artificial or extraneous way. If we end up showing Sweetgrass to anthropologists and people are disgruntled  that we don’t give them enough information, we’ll have to defend ourselves. But  we’re happy with the choices we made. I never studied Stan’s work but came to  know it when we were colleagues in Boulder, and as I showed his films in my  classes. Stan would go to a café on Pearl Street every day and paint directly on  celluloid. Th at was how he was making his films at the time. One Christmas he  generously gave us a few frames as a present. I think that attention to detail, to  the frame itself, in fact to parts within the frame, was influential on our thinking  about film, and even about video—which for Stan was, of course, toxic waste.  Each tiny element, each frame, each sound needs to be carefully considered.  But while he would build up a frame, by painting or gluing layers upon layers,  we would deconstruct what we’d shot on video, pulling bits apart, separating  sound from video at times, separating out the various sync sound tracks, and then  reconstructing it all back together. SM: Lucien, your sensory ethnography approach to teaching film at Harvard blurs  the boundaries of documentary and avant-garde film; did your living in Boulder  move you in this direction, or does your interest in the widest spectrum of cinema  predate those years? LC-T: It’s hard to say. It was definitely influenced by joining Harvard’s art depart- ment, and realizing just to what degree artists and anthropologists talk past each  other, even, indeed especially, when they think they’re addressing one another.  Anthropologists are the guiltier by far, heirs to a kind of post-structuralism that  still sees all the world as a text, a form of cultural textology that has totally discol- ored the way the discipline has engaged aesthetics. To have artists as colleagues  and collaborators, and to see how conceptually and perceptually freeing it was  not to be forever hung up on rendering the whole magnitude of existence and all  the vicissitudes of experience as so many iterations of linguified “meaning,” was a  huge revelation to me. But the Sensory Ethnography Lab equally reflects the particular culture  of anthropology at Harvard, and the noncanonical literary sensibilities and  283 </page> <page sequence="25"> Scott MacDonald philosophical inclination of many of my anthropology colleagues. Not to mention  the intellectual provocations of the grad students, which I didn’t expect at all:  I thought they’d be as conservative as could be, Goody Two-Shoes straight-A  students; they have turned out to be my greatest stimulation of all. As for Boulder, being in film studies expanded my horizons no end, but not  really beyond avant-garde film. I’m working now in sound, as well as photography  and video; I don’t relate to the desire to identify with or feel confined to any par- ticular “art form.” Greenbergian medium-specificity seems so myopic and almost  self-validating; art may be species-specific, and so all of ours’ anthropomorphic,  but not much more than that. SM: Is the title Sweetgrass in any sense a reference to the Merian C. Cooper, Ernest  B. Schoedsack film, Grass [US, 1925]? Th ere too, domesticated animals climb over  a mountain. IB: By calling it Sweetgrass, I think we make it fairly clear that we are referencing  Grass. We don’t expect that most people who see our film will have seen Grass,  but when we were thinking about our project as a kind of salvage ethnography,  we thought back to films we’d seen and studied and taught, and about ways in  which we might respond to this history in our work, either by doing some kind  of imitation or some kind of contradiction. Certainly Grass was foremost in our  minds because it is about this huge seasonal migration of animals. LC-T: “Sweet Grass” is the name of one of the counties where we shot, where the  town of Big Timber is. Sweetgrass was Lisa’s title and the tilt of the hat to Cooper  and Schoedsack was hers. I wanted “Sweetgrass Beartooth,” which I now realize  is too much of a mouthful. Grass is an amazing work, in its own way—though  it’s also classically Orientalist; in its representation of the Bakhtiari it’s much  closer to the racializing and patronizing colonial travelogues of the period than  Nanook [Robert Flaherty, US, 1921], which incarnated a kind of humanism that  seems to me totally without precedent. In any case, Sweetgrass is not predicated on  anyone getting that reference. I see Sweetgrass as a revisionist riff  on the pastoral,  an age-old form in literature and painting. IB: And now that Sweetgrass is finished, we’re going to depart from the pastoral and  make our own version of King Kong [Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack,  US, 1933]! Seriously, I do think it’s interesting that aft er exploring the intensity of a  mass migration of animals, Cooper and Schoedsack delved further into animality  by exploring the dark, bestial nature of man. 284 </page> <page sequence="26"> Interviews SM: I first became aware of the sheepherding project when you showed the short  pieces as a kind of feature at Hamilton College, and indeed they work as a feature  for me—a feature as evocative and beautiful, in many ways, as Sweetgrass itself. Am  I correct that these short pieces were completed before the final cuts of Sweetgrass? LC-T: In really rough cut form, yes. Long before. But the sound work was all done  aft er, in the fall of 2009 with Ernst Karel, and for me they’re more sound pieces  than they are video. And I also fiddled with the picture, making hundreds of  changes even aft er I’d exhibited earlier versions of them, with just rough and ready  stereo sound patched in. SM: Lucien, you’ve said that the short pieces that you’ve completed along with  Sweetgrass were conceived as gallery pieces, though I’ve never quite understood  why you would want them seen in a gallery, where their unusually patient sense  of time would get lost on nearly everyone strolling through. It’s true that some  avant-garde filmmakers (I don’t know that this is the case with documentary  makers) have moved toward gallery installation because of what seems an almost  unbelievable disparity in potential financial reward between installation work  and works made for theatrical projection. Can you help me understand why you  would consider these pieces for gallery presentation, and second, how they would  work as installations in an ideal situation? LC-T: Hell Roaring Creek [US, 2010] might seem patient to you, as a spectator,  though I kick myself for my impetuousness when shooting it, but you can hardly  call Th e High Trail [US, 2010], or Bedding Down [US, 2010], or Into-the-jug  (“Geworfen”) [US, 2010] patient, or durational in any meaningful way. Th ey all  bombard you with diff erent kinds of frenetic, tactile intensity. Basically, in the course of editing the material we had shot, which was around  200 hours all in, various sequences jumped out at me as having a kind of structural  integrity or some kind of aesthetic autonomy or value that would be eclipsed or at  least radically attenuated if they were included in the single-channel documentary.  I remember Umberto Eco a long time ago describing film as being constituted  by so many “syntagmatic chains imbued with argumentative capacity.” Th is is a  weakness, a foreclosing of aesthetic possibility, as well as a strength. Documentary  is even worse in this regard than so-called narrative cinema, in that it conjoins the  kinds of closure to which narrative typically tends with its explicit concern with  expository argumentation, or logical propositionality. As Gabriel Marcel once  said, you don’t go to the movies to hear a lecture on the “doctrine of Kant” or to  “listen to explications.” Yet oft en times with documentaries that’s about all you get! 285 </page> <page sequence="27"> Scott MacDonald As much as we sought to resist this in Sweetgrass, the film still has a narrative  structure, an ostensibly very simple one at that, and hence all the limits that  narrative entails. Th e other works assumed their rough shape before we finished  Sweetgrass, and a few of them. in earlier versions, were installed at Marian Good- man Gallery in 2007 and at CUNY’s James Gallery in 2008, but I’m actually  only getting around to finishing them now, in 2010. Th ese pieces explore diff erent  structures and also quite diff erent stylistic registers from Sweetgrass. It feels to me  like they made themselves, in a sense. I didn’t have an exhibition space in mind  when they were being edited. But your question points to a real conundrum. I’d be  staggered if there weren’t as many starving self-appelled artists as there are starving  self-appelled filmmakers, so I’m not at all sure that financial motivation can oft en  be a factor; and for many, the obscenity of the recent high capitalization of the art  world might be more a source of repulsion than of attraction. I know in my case, and I’d guess also for many working in so-called film  or video art, the motivating factor is a desire to get more from your audience, a  deeper and a diff erent kind of spectatorial attention to the work—one, for me at  least, less attuned to narrative chains of meaning than to sheer manifestations of  being, and to forms of figural expressivity that are more ambiguous and opaque  than narrative’s proclivity to discursive clarity usually allows. I don’t think art is  usually apprehended with the same desire to circumscribe meaning. Liam Gillick oft en frames “relational aesthetics” in terms of a return to  discourse, as if that’s an ideological, or political gesture. But I think he has it  quite wrong, and that Lyotard got it pretty much dead right in Discours/figure:  figuration is much more unruly, much more of a provocation, and an interven- tion, than discourse, which, in its self-sufficiency and capacity to say essentially  anything, and its faith in lucidity and transparency, constantly threatens to control  and manipulate the messy material world which we inhabit, and which mercifully  will always have a magnitude to it in excess of our representations of it. Discourse  is about signification, its space is essentially flat; the figural is about sense, and the  sensorial, and its space is deep. Of course, everything, even discourse, is, in the end,  figural—if you take the metaphor and metonymy out of language there’s nothing  left —but it’s attenuated, almost ashamed, figuration, which is perhaps why it’s  constantly trying to colonize and control it. But you point to a very real problem that I think all film and video artists,  and art curators, struggle with, and which is never going to go away: how best to  exhibit time-based figural media in a gallery or art context? To be super crude and  schematic, there’s this dyad of a white cube versus a black box. In reality of course,  any site, theater, studio or street, public or private, has its own specificity. But  when Sharon Lockhart’s recent Lunch Break was installed at Barbara Gladstone  gallery in New York, I think they made a big mistake in simply recreating a black  286 </page> <page sequence="28"> Interviews box within a white cube. Th ey also left  the rear wall white, reducing the contrast  ratio of the projection by over 50 percent. But had the film been installed in a long  dark tunnel mirroring the corridor that is the subject of the piece, as I imagine  Sharon would have liked, it would have been something else entirely. Th e biggest problem though seems to me the temporal one, and the aesthetic  of a loop, which has to be an aesthetic of the fragment, a metonymic aesthetic  whereby a part, any part, has to be able to work on its own terms, and also in  some ways stand in for the whole. Th e Dutch artists de Rijke and de Rooij would  sometimes announce the screening times of their films, when shown in museums,  and even try to prohibit admission once they had started rolling, replicating the  finite temporality of the theater in a non-theatrical site. But in general, even if you  want a richer and less circumscribed kind of attention when showing work in an  art context than a cinema one, you also get less, at least temporally, as people walk  in and out of a loop willy-nilly. If you take Hell Roaring Creek, which is my favorite piece I’ve made, except  maybe for Bedding Down, it consists of seven movements if you see it linearly, but  only six if you experience it as a loop and stay with it all the way through: three  periods of black with sound and three of picture with sound. Th e three periods of  picture are all iterations of or excerpts from what originated as a single shot, a fusion  of real and cinematic time. Th ere’s a temporality, and a narrativity, to the whole,  with the first period of black and then the first of picture setting up the expectation  of an event, a happening of some unknown kind, which only begins to take form  towards the end of the first shot. Th e “event” turns out to be both infinite, or  seemingly infinite, in the second shot, and then to become something of a nonevent  (dawn is past, the sky is overcast, the creek has returned to its undisturbed self )  in the third. But the piece is also made to be seen in part: to be sure, what you get  experiencing one, say, 90-second fragment is not the same as what you get from  another, so there’s also an interactivity and a renunciation of authorial control there,  but this can be liberating and part of the open-endedness of the work. I should maybe mention another thing, which is huge. I call all of these  pieces “audiovideo” works, because they have five discrete channels of sound; and  in many ways sound is more important to them than picture. Few theaters are  equipped to play back 5.1 or 7.1 (or any other format of ) surround sound, and fewer  still from HD video, rather than 35mm film. So to show them in a non-surround  theater, which is the norm for avant-garde and documentary screenings, is like  cutting off  more than half their limbs, and to privilege a kind of ocularcentricity  which the works themselves oppose. Two more points, then I’ll shut up. James Benning’s given up on film, or so  he says (Ngugi wa Th iongo returned to English having vowed he’d write only in  Kikuyu thenceforth), because he can’t deal with the nightmare of 16mm processing  287 </page> <page sequence="29"> Scott MacDonald any more. Who can blame him? But, for all of the putatively “lossless” infinite  clonability of the digital, and its subversion of the distinction between original  and copy, video exhibition is as fickle and mercurial, and downright complex, as  anything ever invented, far more unreliable than even 16m projection ever was.  It’s an unmitigated nightmare. But if you install a work in an exhibition space,  you potentially have much more control over the playback of the picture—as  well as the sound. Lastly, the site-specificity of theatrical spaces is essentially repressed, or a  given—if you’re present, you might fiddle with the sound level or ask for a new  bulb for the projector, but your choices are very limited, and if you’re absent, you  don’t even give it a thought. We haven’t the foggiest inkling about the theatrical  spaces where Sweetgrass is showing. But gallery installation engages with the  space directly and unavoidably. Hell Roaring Creek, for instance, is designed to be  projected onto a hanging, translucent screen, so you can view it from either side.  You can’t walk through it, in the stream itself, but you can walk around it, in eff ect  along either bank of the creek, and watch and listen to it from either side. Th e  five-channel surround is also to be installed on both sides of the screen, so you’re  eff ectively dealing with ten channels of sound, all situated spatially in relationship  to a two-sided screen. A far cry from a cinema, or, worse, a classroom. SM: I have some questions about the individual short pieces. Only two are made up  exclusively of material that didn’t get into the final cut of Sweetgrass: Hell Roaring  Creek and Bedding Down. Of all the short pieces, Hell Roaring Creek seems most  obviously its own piece; for me it’s the gem of the project, and of the short pieces,  the most closely related to avant-garde work (the other short pieces seem more  like, say, John Marshall’s “sequence films” on the !Kung and Timothy Asch’s on  the Yanomami). Hell Roaring Creek reminds me of Benning and Hutton and also  of J. J. Murphy’s Sky Blue Water Light Sign [US, 1972]—I wonder if you know it? LC-T: I’ve never seen it. In fact, I’ve never seen anything by Murphy. SM: Hell Roaring Creek is made up of three shots, each separated from the other by  a 10-second moment of black. Why those breaks?—it is clear that for the second  shot, you’ve moved the camera closer (or have readjusted your zoom lens) and that  you move back to the original position aft er the second pause—does each visual  pause represent a break in time? Th e two caesuras do function to wake the viewer  up, to refresh one’s attention. LC-T: I don’t really know how to talk about this work yet. It wasn’t shot as a  conceptual piece, but it’s become one, at least in part, for me. It was a mistake. It  288 </page> <page sequence="30"> Interviews was my first time in the mountains, and my first year with that many sheep. We  were trailing in, we set up camp, bedded the sheep down, and then Lawrence,  the rancher, showed me where we’d cross the creek the next morning. I think the  whole eff ect of Hell Roaring Creek is predicated on my not knowing anything  about it, so hopefully nobody will read this who hasn’t seen it already. I knew we’d be getting up about 4:00 and would cross the creek around 5:00  or a little later. I guessed where the sun would come up. And then I guessed how  long it would take for the herd, all 3,000 of them, to cross. I was thinking 3–4  minutes. I decided I’d stand in the creek, and film the crossing in a single shot.  Th e sun would be coming up behind, it would be beautiful, and I thought it might  make a great 3-minute pre-title sequence to what would become Sweetgrass, and  alert viewers to the durational qualities of the film, and the kind of patience it  would demand. Well, what did I know? It took them 30 minutes, not 3, to cross. I could only  guess at the time while I was shooting, but I knew it wouldn’t work in the way I’d  imagined the night before. So I was thinking on the fly, and I lost confidence in it  as a single-shot—only partially, but enough to screw it up. Aft er about 10 minutes,  I slowly zoomed in, to change the camera angle. I somehow instinctively knew  not to stop shooting, to hold on to that conflation between real and cinematic  time, but I was still thinking about Sweetgrass and felt the need to change camera  angle, or in this case focal length, so we’d have the option of cutting later. But aft er  20 minutes, the crossing was still going strong, the band seemingly infinite, like  Rabelais’s “moutons de Panurge” in Pantegruel. And I started fretting about the  zoom in, and what that had done to the shot, so I slowly zoomed out again, as if  that might somehow rectify my original sin. And still the crossing took another  10 minutes. Had I not zoomed, in or out, my guess is that I would have left  it as this struc- tural single-shot. But I tried that and was never happy with it. Because zooming  is forbidden, tainted by its use and abuse in television, I really wanted to include  the zooms and stick with the shot as a whole. But I just found it too distracting,  and too much about me. I’m a biped, not a tripod, and even though I was trying  to hold the camera as still as if it were on a tripod, all the little movements tell  you that it’s handheld. I like them, but also feel that that was enough about me.  And in the same way that I initially wanted to retain the zooms because they’re  forbidden, I also wanted to subvert or somehow move beyond all the macho  heroics of structural filmmaking, which seem dated now, the dogmatic slumber  of a certain generation, and oft en also, epistemologically pretty naive. Benning’s  RR [US, 2007]—which I love—feels so impatient as almost to be impetuous, in  its complete exclusion of the before and aft er, those periods of transformation that  are so much more revealing than the restricted times the trains take to traverse  289 </page> <page sequence="31"> Scott MacDonald the frame. So then I cut out the two zoom movements, and for years—honestly,  years—played with how to combine the truncated shots that were left , from  straight cuts to using as many minutes of black as I’d cut out. Every time I thought  I’d got it right, I’d watch it again, a few months later, and it felt all wrong. In the  end, I settled on two sections of 10 seconds, and another of a minute (or two of  30 seconds, if you don’t see it as a loop). With the surround sound composition that Ernst and I built, that feels about  right to me now. Maybe it’ll feel all wrong in five years. As I see it, the stretches of  black ask you to question what you think you’re seeing. You might even wonder,  when you return to the image, if this is the same crossing or if it was shot another  time. Or if you trust that it’s one and the same, you still have to ask yourself what  was cut out, and why, or wonder if there was more than one camera, because of  the shift  in focal length combined with apparent infinity of Panurge’s sheep. Th e  first 10-second section of black is hell, a killer, a complete violation of the temporal  fusion you’ve been experiencing and of the unconsummated anticipation of an  event that’s only just beginning, but the second period of black, or rather the  return to the wider shot at the end of the second stretch of black, recontextualizes  that. It also returns humans to the ecological fold, somewhat bestialized aft er  the three thousand head of sheep, and you’re jerked out of the almost atemporal  synchronicity of the middle section, which has no beginning or end, where you’re  engaging essentially aesthetically, rather than narratively, your attention fluctuating  between the vertical stream of water and the horizontal one of sheep, between the  sheep as a collectivity and all of their individual particularities—the ewes and the  lambs, the shorn and the unshorn, the arthritic and the athletic, the fearful and the  fearless—you’re jerked out of these ruminations, and forcibly plunged back into  the narrative temporality of the crossing, with the end now in sight. So you, or I (it’s just awful when an artist tells you how you feel) simultane- ously give myself over to the perceptual experience of this durational flow and ask  myself all these conceptual questions. As the unraveling of an “image-idea,” that  took forever to congeal, I’m finally reconciled to it. SM: It’s interesting to see how the longer film sometimes includes a substantial  portion of the relevant short piece (Coom Biddy, for example, Daybreak on the  Bedground [US, 2010] and Turned at the Pass [US, 2010]) and sometimes uses  very little of the short piece (Th e High Trail, Into-the-Jug (“Geworfen”)). Having  finished the short pieces, was it difficult to reedit them into a form that felt  comfortable in Sweetgrass? LC-T: No. From around 2006 on, they were already separate in my mind. In a sense,  Sweetgrass quotes or lift s from some of the audiovideo pieces, but not actually  290 </page> <page sequence="32"> Interviews that much, and with the shorter shot lengths and recontextualization within  Sweetgrass the shared shots feel quite diff erent to me. Coom Biddy is a triptych,  with the two formal, static images sandwiching the long interior tracking shot.  Th ere’s no way that tracking shot could have been sustained within Sweetgrass,  because of the narrative thrust propelling the film forward, and excluding other  kinds of aesthetic engagement. Bedding Down is about the real, in a totally diff erent register from the other  works, with nothing but jump cuts, its low-res handheld horseback video, and  initially unlocatable sync sound track that, as the piece proceeds, increasingly  channels the agonistic, diabolic descent into a kind of violent interiority. Th e  picture seems in places to decompose, moving in amorphous waves as the rider  rises and falls. It’s at once at the threshold of the visible and at the threshold of  the technological, pushing the camera’s sensors and automation beyond their  capabilities. It’s true that some of these pieces can be seen to reframe or elaborate  a sequence that also appears in Sweetgrass, like the dialogue-heavy Breakfast, but  for me they’re quite separate. SM: Where does the title Into-the-Jug (translated as “Geworfen”) come from? LC-T: “Geworfen” is actually part of the title, not its translation. Th e small pens that  newborn lambs and their “mothers” are placed in for the first few days of the lambs’  life are called “jugs.” Don’t ask me why, unless it’s just as a symbol of containment.  I’ve asked a few people, and they don’t know either. I suppose, if it weren’t for the  roving, fallible camera, that this is the one piece—an 11-minute single shot, limited  in dutiful Bazinian fashion to the duration of the various births it depicts—that  might be seen to give itself over to some of the indulgences of structural film. For me, it proceeds through slow disclosure, and progressively defamiliarizes  and reframes its subject as it goes along. But birth, especially of course of innocent,  harmless, soon-to-be-gamboling lambs, is as over-determined as anything could  ever be, and the births we’re witness to are so tactile, so viscous, so acoustically  overbearing, and so physically intense that it’s hard not to avert your gaze. As Susan  Sontag once put it, we’re not blessed with earlids, so unless you leave the room  you can’t avert your consciousness altogether. In Into-the-Jug (Geworfen), sound  is even more a vector of the abject than the picture. But it’s hard to give the piece  your full attention on an initial viewing. And even if you do, it probably takes  anyone other than a sheep rancher the full 11 minutes to figure out what exactly  is going on: to realize that the lambs are being mixed and matched like nobody’s  business, and that the ties of kinship being created are fictive, not biological, and  mediated through and through with the well-nigh omnipotent agency of the man  pulling them out. A very particular, and rather disturbing form of consanguinity! 291 </page> <page sequence="33"> Scott MacDonald Basically, mothering ewes have diff erent amounts of milk, and some can  support two (very occasionally, three) lambs, and some (especially many two- year-olds) just one. But once you start mixing and matching, you create this pool  of “bum” lambs. And you only have about a twenty-four-hour window when you  can convince an ewe that a lamb that is not her biological off spring is hers, by  covering it in the caul and amniotic fluid of her own newborn (or the flayed skin  of her stillborn). So you automatically take the biological lamb away from her  because you have others who have been alive for going-on 24 hours and who need  a mother bad. Th e clock’s ticking. Th e man, in short, is God, a deus ex machina,  even if he’s down on his knees in the jug grunting and groaning with his bloody  arm stuck up the vaginas of the mothers in labor. What kind of “nature” is this? “Domesticated” doesn’t seem the right word  for it; it’s not about taming. It’s more precisely a form of wildness and unholy  alchemy that we don’t even have a word for. In short, within the space of these 11  minutes, the whole ideological edifice and opposition between nature and culture  collapses in a pool of impure interspecies nascency on the floor of the strawed  jug. In any event, as for the title, this piece evokes for me Martin Heidegger’s core  concept, his neologism Geworfenheit, which is usually translated as “Th rownness,”  or “Th rown-into-the-World” in English. It was his principal revision to Husserlian  phenomonology and Husserl’s notion of the Lebenswelt—immediate, intuitive,  unreflective lived experience—as opposed to the Weltanschaung, one’s worldview,  which is a matter of metaphysics, of belief, of rationality, of ideology. Heidegger wanted to emphasize the way our lot in life, our Dasein, the flux  of our Being-in-the-world is constrained and structured and in many ways is a  function of all these variables and contingencies that lie outside of our control,  beyond our grasp, that predate us, and so on. For me, Into-the-Jug is an absolutely  literal exemplification of that thrownness, that Geworfenheit, all these newborn  lambs being thrown around with such abandon but also with such attention.  And their being paired up with mothers—not willy nilly, because the rancher is  processing a mass of calculations as he chooses who to couple with whom, but  in ways and for reasons unknown to the lambs but which will go a long way to  determining the kind of life they’ll lead. And in everyday, colloquial German,  Geworfen (without the nominalizing suffix) is used to describe both whelping and  foaling. Quite possibly also, though not so far as I know, lambing. Metaphorically  then, being born is being thrown. What more perfect image of Dasein is there than  this moving, messy image of liquid, liminal entry into life itself ? SM: You’ve developed the “Sensory Ethnography” program at Harvard. I assume  you’re using “sensory ethnography” as opposed to verbal ethnography (writing  about cultural practices in essays, books, or in screenplays for documentaries that  292 </page> <page sequence="34"> Interviews use a lecture format). Your interest in filmmaking seems experiential in the sense  that John Dewey talks about artworks being concentrations/intensifications of  lived experiences, rather than informational presentations and/or theoretical  conjectures; and your sense of “ethnographic film” seems much broader than what  that term traditionally is taken to mean. Tell me about the thinking that resulted  in the Sensory Ethnography program, your decision to use “sensory ethnography,”  and how your program plays out practically. LC-T: Well, you pretty much just said it all. Juxtaposing perspectives from the  sciences, the arts, and the humanities, the aim of the Sensory Ethnography Lab is  to support innovative combinations of aesthetics and ethnography, especially with  work conducted through audiovisual media (video, sound, film, photography, and  “new” hypermedia), that are at an angle to dominant conventions in anthropology,  documentary, and art practice. I suppose it’s worth situating the Sensory Ethnography Lab both within  the provincial domain of Harvard and within the larger trajectories of visual  anthropology, documentary, and art practice. Harvard has long been extremely  intellectually timorous about the arts—happy to exhibit them (in the Fogg),  commodify them (make the odd purchase—though these days neither the Fogg  and the art museums nor the Peabody has a significant acquisition budget to  speak of ), and perform them (especially undergraduate orchestras and dramatic  groups), but not to actively produce them within the academic belly of the beast.  Th e art department has a name (Visual and Environmental Studies) that does its  level best to disavow the art-making that goes on there and which corresponds to  no disciplinary nomenclature outside the university. Th e same is true, in a way, of  the History of Consciousness program at University of California Santa Cruz,  but because of the distinctiveness of the work that came out of there, especially  during the early decades, it achieved a kind of totemic status, and was recognized  within the humanities and the human sciences. Th at’s not really the case for VES,  which until recently has been an undergraduate-only program which has signally  failed to conjugate the “visual” and the “environmental” in any systematic way. But all this is now changing, and very fast. Drew Faust, Harvard’s president,  has three big agendas—art practice and creative work, global health, and  environmental consciousness. Her first significant act as president was to create  a task force for the arts, chaired by Stephen Greenblatt, which recommended  integrating art-making into the cognitive life of the university across the board,  and especially in the graduate and undergraduate curricula. Th e sequel to the  task force, a new committee on the arts (HUCA), is now deciding how to imple- ment the recommendations and what kind of graduate art-making programs  to establish. Th e Sensory Ethnography Lab, the Graduate School of Design’s  293 </page> <page sequence="35"> Scott MacDonald new degree in Art, Design, and the Public Domain, the practice-based Ph.D.  in Media Anthropology, and the new fellowship program at the Film Study  Center (Harvard’s one center devoted to art-making or creative work), all have  to be understood within this new commitment to take art-making as seriously,  as a cultural and intellectual endeavor, as traditional scientific and humanistic  forms of academic scholarship. As for situating the Sensory Ethnography Lab within the larger trajectories  of visual anthropology, documentary, and contemporary art, your reference to  Dewey seems right on. On the one hand, the SEL’s ethnographic imperatives  mean that the work coming out of it is generally more committed to the “real”  than art is, especially conceptual and postconceptual art, and to a form of expres- sion that is somehow adequate to the magnitude of human experience. Or, if  that’s too much, at least to working within (as well as against) various species  of realism. Dewey seems crucial here, especially Art as Experience, which has  somehow been neglected by anthropologists of art. I would guess there are at least  two reasons why. In the first place, Dewey takes as his subject, although he does  not use the term, the phenomenology of aesthetic experience—experience that  surely is at the heart of human existence if anything is, but which is something  that anthropologists of art have actually not been very interested in, concerned  instead to reduce being to mere meaning, and art to so many epiphenomena of  one or another culture, to mere “material culture,” or to something analogous to  ritual, and so on and so forth. In the second place, Dewey is deeply invested in “nature,” to recursively  coupling aesthetic experience not simply with everyday experience, but also  with its infra-human animalic sources, and the at once sub- and supra-cutaneous  interaction between what he called—three decades or more before the coinage of  “cyborgs”—the co-constituting “live creature” and its “environment,” whereas for  social and cultural anthropologists talk of nature has long been something of an  embarrassment—to be disavowed, immediately transformed into “second nature,”  mediated through-and-through by culture, a mere social construction, or (as with  Bruno Latour) a dangerous political or scientific ideology to be actively combated. Like Dewey, the SEL is concerned, not to analyze, but to actively produce  aesthetic experience, and of kinds that reflect and draw on but do not necessarily  clarify or leave one with the illusion of “understanding” everyday experience, and  it also seeks to transcend what is oft en considered the particular province of the  human, and delve into nature—in short, to reconjugate culture with nature, to  pursue promiscuities between animalic and non-animalic selves and others, and  to restore us both to the domain of perception, in all its plenitude, rather than the  academic game of what Dewey called “recognition,” or of naming, that he derided  as a barely conscious endeavor; and to the fleshy realm, in Merleau-Ponty’s phrase,  294 </page> <page sequence="36"> Interviews of “wild being,” in which the invisible, far from being the negation or contradic- tion of the visible, is in fact its “secret sharer,” its membrure . . . I think it is also true that the works emerging from the SEL are more  concerned with issues of aesthetics and form than documentary usually is, and  are for the most part opposed to conventional documentary on a slew of counts:  to the journalistic use of interviews, or of featuring subjects merely talking about  their lives, ex post facto, rather than actually living them; to the reductive range of  dramaturgical narrative structures documentary typically deploys, their linearity  and predilection for resolution and closure; and to the narrow repertoire of styles  that are sanctioned by the gatekeepers of documentary practice—in particular the  ongoing hegemony half a century aft er the fact of a kind of lazy and lax cinéma  vérité, and the consecration of a frequently unseeing and unsensing, putatively  “observational,” aesthetic within the ethnographic film world, and its dismissal  of anything experimental, structurally rigorous, or stylistically demanding as  provincially “avant-garde” or unduly self-reflexive or self-indulgent. It is as if  the custodians of the sacred flame of ethnographic cinema are oblivious to any  developments in art or in film since Jean Rouch’s experiments in ethno-fiction in  the 1960s and 1970s. Lastly, I think it’s true that the SEL is also opposed, though this time in the  name of art and its inherent exegetical ambiguity—in the name, that is to say, of  the figural and its opacity, over against the discursive and its desire for transpar- ency—to the clarity and interpretive self-sufficiency to which anthropology and  academia typically tend, and is much more invested in what John Keats, in his  famous letter to his brother, characterized as “negative capability”—the quintes- sentially human capacity to be, as he put it, “in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts  without any irritable reaching aft er fact &amp; reason.” In regards to anthropology, this  inclination to the perceptual first and the conceptual second implicitly entails a  relativization of the “cultural textology,” in Barbara Staff ord’s phrase, bequeathed  by the hermeneutic turn of Cliff ord Geertz, and a renewed interrogation of  core abstractions like culture, society, and the self (or at least, representations of  the self ), and a return to the primacy of the individual, the body, and above all  intersubjective and intercorporeal experience—as the ground of what is thought  and what is said, as the ground of both meaning and symbolism. Th ere are more than enough precursors for this move in addition to Dewey,  Keats, and Merleau-Ponty. Th is is the domain, in part, of what Mead and Bateson  (in Balinese Character) called “kinaesthetic learning.” In existential anthropolo- gist Michael Jackson’s more recent expression, it is “practical mimesis.” It is also,  to be sure, the realm of the nonverbal and the nondiscursive, or, in Foucault’s  neo-Kantian terms, the “seeable” (though why privilege sight? Why not simply  sensible) but “un-sayable.” Th e cinema, video, and sound, all have a particular  295 </page> <page sequence="37"> Scott MacDonald purchase on the experiential that diff ers quite fundamentally from that of our  written representations, particularly in their deployment, as Vivian Sobchack  emphasized, of acts of moving, hearing, and seeing as at once the originary  structures of embodied existence and the mediating structures of discourse. SM: Not only Sweetgrass and the related installation works, but the films I’ve seen  by your students J.P. Sniadecki, Véréna Paravel, and Stephanie Spray seem to fit  within two traditionally distinct historical paradigms: they are documentaries  of cultural places, moments, and practices; but they are also contributions to the  strand of avant-garde filmmaking that includes Bruce Baillie, James Benning,  Peter Hutton, Nathaniel Dorsky, and Sharon Lockhart. Am I correct that you  have jettisoned the distinction between “documentary” and “avant-garde”? LC-T: Yes. Not deliberately, I don’t think, or in some kind of dogmatic way. But  just because the distinction seems indefensible, and it would never occur to me  to invoke it. It’s also unfortunate: documentarians as a result oft en don’t see any  reason to engage with so-called experimental or avant-garde traditions, and on the  flip side, a category like “experimental” implicitly sets itself off  against a domain  that is thereby defined as nonexperimental, as if documentarians just follow the  rules and regulations of a genre by rote. But all genres have their conventions, are  in a constant state of flux and de- and re-formation. I think Bourdieu overstated his case that artists, like intellectuals, are forever  in competition with their fellows, as they seek to carve out a niche in which to  inscribe their “authority” in a particular “field” of cultural production. It’s not,  of course, that artists are any less self-interested than anyone else, but rather that  many are oft en willfully ignorant of what others are doing even within their own  “field” (a term that only makes sense to me if the root metaphor is a multidimen- sional electromagnetic field, rather than a planar agricultural one). For my part, I  know that when I’m working on a project, I oft en feel the need not to know about  or experience work that is in some sense “related,” lest it compromise my eff orts  to find the proper form for whatever it is I’m doing. In any event, consigning the  works of such diff erent film- and video-makers as, say, Jana Ševčiková, Dorothy  Cross, Sergei Dvortsevoy, Pedro Costa, Rosalind Nashashibi, Sharon Lockhart,  Alexandr Sokurov, Steve McQueen, or Phil Collins exclusively to either the  avant-garde, or contemporary art, or documentary, makes no sense. Tales from the SEL “Tales from the SEL” is a panorama of conversations with veterans of the Sensory  Ethnography Lab. Th e section begins with a composite conversation with J.P.  296 </page> <page sequence="38"> Interviews Sniadecki, Stephanie Spray, Véréna Paravel about their experiences finding their  way to the SEL and studying there (it combines excerpts of an interview I did  with Paravel and Sniadecki when they visited Colgate University in 2011 with  email interchanges with Spray). Th is is followed by a conversation with Sniadecki  about his films; with Spray about hers; then with Paravel and Sniadecki about  their collaboration, Foreign Parts [US, 2010]; and finally, with Castaing-Taylor  and Paravel on their collaboration, Leviathan [US, 2012]. With a single exception, J. P. Sniadecki has worked in China, creating a series  of films—Songhua (US, 2007), Chaiqian (Demolition) (US, 2008), Sichuan  Triptych (US, 2010)—that function as visual synecdoches of a culture in transfor- mation. Songhua was filmed in and around the Songhua River as it flows through  the city of Harbin. Sniadecki presents a series of extended views (the first three  shots are 93, 132, and 59 seconds, respectively) that gradually allow this complex  environment to cohere; and he captures a wide range of people who, like himself,  are using and enjoying the river and the activities around it—before revealing at  the conclusion of Songhua that, according to Chinese state radio, the river had  recently been the site of a massive chemical spill that had halted water supplies to  tens of millions of people, and in fact had endured more than 130 water pollution  accidents in the previous months. Chaiqian (Demolition) explores a city block in Chengdu where a building has  been demolished to make way for a major new construction project. Sniadecki  works (as filmmaker) beside the men and women who are separating cement and  metal and loading the harvested rebar onto trucks. From time to time, he interacts  with these workers as he shoots, during breaks for meals, and when Sniadecki and  several workers spend an evening exploring Chengdu, as well as with some boys  who ride bicycles on a half-pipe next to the rubble. Implicit within the activities  Sniadecki records and within his framing are issues of class diff erence and of  social control: when a policewoman sees the laborers being filmed by Sniadecki  in a public square, she intervenes. Th e men explain that Sniadecki is a Harvard  graduate student, but the officer makes clear that workers are not allowed to draw  a crowd in a public place: “People will think something is wrong.” Sichuan Triptych records three separate locations: part 1 was filmed in Ganzi  Tibetan autonomous prefecture in Western Sichuan, where the Chinese presence  is represented by a cadre of soldiers who are seen and heard marching through the  town; part 2, at the site of the massive earthquake that struck Qingchuan County  in northern Sichuan in May 2008. Part 3 begins in the city of Chengdu and then  moves to a farm in central Sichuan, where Sniadecki records a family watching the  opening of the Beijing Olympics on a tiny black-and-white TV—capturing the  immense gap between an older generation of Chinese workers and the new, high- tech capitalism. As in Songhua Sniadecki’s approach in Sichuan Triptych is, on one  297 </page> <page sequence="39"> Scott MacDonald hand, evocative of the formalist avant-garde—his sound-image compositions are  inventive and suggestive—and, at the same time, engage individual Chinese on  a personal level: Sniadecki interacts with various individuals, including in each  location, a policeman who tells him that filming is forbidden. Sniadecki’s fascina- tion with and aff ection for China are obvious, but the challenges of working there  (for him and for Chinese workers) are regularly in evidence. Stephanie Spray has made all of her videos in rural Nepal, filming with several  families she has gotten to know over a period of years. Kale and Kale (US, 2007)  focuses on two men nicknamed “Kale” (Dharma Singh Gayek and Ram Bahadur  Gayek) and their daily activities; Monsoon-Reflections (US, 2008) on several of the  Gayek women working in gardens, grooming each other, talking; and As Long as  Th ere’s Breath (US, 2009) again on several members of the Gayek family as they  manage their daily lives and converse about their experiences—including in one  instance a remarkably candid conversation among several women about dildos!  Untitled (US, 2009) is a single, continuous 14-minute shot of a man and a woman  sitting in front of their dwelling, somewhat drunk, goofing around. In each of these videos, Spray positions herself on the ground, implicitly  within the circle of the group she is recording, as if her filmmaking is just another  daily activity (which, of course, it is, for both Spray and her subjects). Like  Sniadecki, Spray records in sync, but is particularly interested in working with  off -screen sound in a manner similar to James Benning. During the second shot  of Monsoon-Reflections, for example, Spray’s camera is positioned so that we see  only a rice paddy, though we hear footsteps approaching through the water for  more than a minute until an old woman, Chet Kumari Gayek, enters the frame.  In Untitled Spray sits in front of the drunken couple, with her back to a street;  vehicles and people, some of whom are acknowledged by the couple, pass behind  Spray and her camera—heard but not seen. With the exception of Sweetgrass and Leviathan, the most widely seen film to  come out of the Sensory Ethnography Lab is Foreign Parts, a feature-length col- laboration between Sniadecki and Véréna Paravel, about the immense automobile  junkyard at Willets Point in Queens, New York—soon to be demolished to  make way for urban “renewal.” Foreign Parts was instigated by Paravel’s 7 Queens  (US, 2008), during which she recorded scenes along the Number 7 subway line  in Queens, which snakes through a series of ethnically diverse neighborhoods,  including Willets Point. Th e complex automobile culture within Willets Point  provides a phantasmagoria of image and sound through the four seasons, as well  as several memorable characters. Sniadecki’s and Paravel’s cinematography and  editing in Foreign Parts (like the editing and cinematography in 7 Queens) are  frenetic, compared with most other SEL films—though quite fitting for this  particular neighborhood. 298 </page> <page sequence="40"> Interviews Leviathan, the most recent SEL success story, was shot on fishing boats  shipping out of New Bedford Massachusetts. Leviathan’s free-form cinematog- raphy—made with small, mobile video cameras held and mounted in a variety of  ways—and its immersion of its audience within the complex and noisy audiovisual  surround of the fishing boats can feel not only overwhelming, but entirely new  in the annals of modern theatrical cinema. Th e film’s title seems to be a refer- ence to the Biblical leviathan, a large sea monster or whale, but the leviathan in  Leviathan is the film itself. Made to be shown on the big screen with surround  sound, Leviathan swallows us—regurgitating us out of the theater at the end of 90  minutes, exhausted and happy to have lived through what is as close to a sensory  trauma as any documentary in recent memory. GETTING INTO THE SEL Scott MacDonald: J.P., how did you get involved in the Sensory Ethnography Lab? J.P. Sniadecki: I’d graduated with a BA in philosophy and communications (mostly  film and video courses) from Grand Valley State University in Michigan in  2002, and then in 2005 started at Harvard as an MA student in what is called  Regional Studies: East Asia. Th at autumn, I went to a lecture course that Lucien  [Castaing-Taylor] was teaching, called “Exploring Culture through Film.” I was  new to Harvard, and I had a desire to get involved with filmmaking. I’d already  learned that there was nothing available for graduate students, unless you lobbied  to get into an undergraduate production class with Robb Moss or Ross McElwee  or Alfred Guzzetti, which could take several semesters even if they were able to let  you in—undergrads must be given priority for VES [Visual and Environmental  Studies] courses. Lucien told me that in the spring of 2006 he was going to off er a  course called Sensory Ethnography, which would be the first-ever graduate-level  production course, and that I should apply. I went to the interview and showed Lucien a film I had made as an undergrad  at Grand Valley State (I’d been out of school for four years)—an activist film for a  prison education program. I was lucky enough to get into the course, with no real  idea of what it would be like—except that each of us would see a film through the  planning, production, and postproduction stages. At the first class meeting, I was  excited to learn that the course was designed to be a confluence of anthropology,  nonfiction filmmaking, and contemporary art practices. SM: What did you do between finishing at Grand Valley State and matriculating  at Harvard? 299 </page> <page sequence="41"> Scott MacDonald JPS: I worked many diff erent jobs. I drove truck; I washed dishes; I taught English  in China; I brought courses in philosophy and film history into a medium-security  prison. And I spent a lot of time traveling: I would work, make some money,  then go off . I think those three-four years of traveling and observing the world  really shaped my filmmaking, honed my attention to gesture, atmosphere, and  soundscape. At Grand Valley, I’d wanted to make films that were experiential and  not didactic, but no one there was supportive. Traveling helped me imagine what  these experiential films might be. The first day of Sensory Ethnography, Lucien showed films by Sergei  Dvortsevoy, Arthur Peleshian, along with Tacita Dean’s Banewl [UK, 1999],  the gorgeous hour-long 16mm film she shot during an eclipse in Greenland. Th e  experience was stunning; these were the kinds of films I’d always wanted to see  and to make. Sensory Ethnography immediately became the most galvanizing and  important thing in my life. We made little pieces for the course—exercises in image and sound—and were  constantly screening wonderful work by filmmakers, artists, and anthropologists.  Th en, aft er the first semester, we were to go away for the summer with Panasonic  hvx-200 camera kits and shoot something more substantial, something that  we would edit over the following fall semester and that would become our final  project for the course. Th e Sensory Ethnography Lab saved me from my initial aversion to Har- vard—for me the speed and privilege with which Harvard functioned was a larger  culture shock than living in China. It was Lucien’s very specific vision, his way of  pushing the boundaries of ethnographic film and documentary in general, that  made me want to stay at Harvard. In the end, I decided to do a PhD. My thesis  focuses on the world of independent documentary film in China—no title yet. SM: Stephanie, how did you find your way to the Sensory Ethnography program? Stephanie Spray: Serendipity. I fell in love with Nepal in 1999 (studied Tibetan language, Buddhism, and  tabla [a popular Indian percussion instrument, used in Hindustani classical  music]) and was on what became a decade-long quest to stay in Nepal, but without  having to get an office job—I really just wanted to hang out, study music, and  speak Nepali. In the end, academia was the only route that seemed viable, so I  ended up back in school. I had gotten a BA in the study of religion at Smith, so it seemed logical to  apply to religious studies programs where I thought I’d be able to get funding  to continue my travels. I got a Masters of Th eological Studies at the Harvard  Divinity School in 2004 and then started a PhD in the Committee on the Study  300 </page> <page sequence="42"> Interviews of Religion at Harvard in 2005. I was starting to feel trapped in my program of  study—so damn textual and discursive!—and about halfway into my first semester  I was scouring the online course catalog for something that would give me creative  outlets (I’d been involved in the visual and performing arts as a youngun in high  school). I stumbled upon the newly listed course in Sensory Ethnography and had  a ten-minute appointment with Lucien in the fall of 2005. He seemed reluctant to  let a theology student with no real film background into the course, but somehow,  I was admitted, along with J.P., in spring 2006 and was, again like J.P., in the second  run of the course in 2007–2008. I transferred to the anthropology department in 2007 and am pursuing a  PhD in anthropology, with two secondary fields—Film and Visual Studies and  Critical Media Practice. So I came to Sensory Ethnography very circuitously, but  in the end, it allowed for a rebirth of sorts. Véréna Paravel: A very diff erent path brought me to the Sensory Ethnography  Lab. Back in France, I had completed a PhD in STS: Science, Technology, and  Society—basically a mix of anthropology, history, sociology, and philosophy.  In France we don’t have the same strict distinctions between anthropology and  other fields. I’d worked closely with philosopher/anthropologist/sociologist  Bruno Latour. My dissertation was on evolving forms of correspondence between  scientists from the seventeenth century to today, from various epistolary genres  up to email and the web. Aft er finishing, I found I had no desire to turn my thesis into a book. My  husband and I moved to New York, and I did a postdoc at Columbia, but increas- ingly felt as if I were getting a slow divorce from academia. Every morning I would  wake up with a film in mind, though I hadn’t as yet touched a movie camera. During this time, people—Faye Ginsburg, Angela Zito—would ask me  what I was “working on.” A typically American question! I’d explain that I was  working on a paper that I wasn’t interested in, but that I had a very precise idea  of a particular film I wanted to make. I’m not a cinephile. I grew up in Africa,  totally unplugged and image-deprived—in a cocoon. Anyway, every time I had  this conversation, the person I was talking to would tell me, “Oh, you should talk  to this guy at Harvard, Lucien Taylor; he’s doing exactly what you want to do.” One day I was sitting on a bench in Harvard Square (we had moved to  Boston), talking to the guy sitting next to me. In my bubble, my obsession, I  mentioned that I wanted to make films, and the guy keeps asking me questions  and finally I learn that this is Lucien Taylor. Before I knew it, with two kids and a  full-time job, I was taking the Sensory Ethnography class. SM: What was Castaing-Taylor like as a teacher? 301 </page> <page sequence="43"> Scott MacDonald VP: Lucien had a very strong posture, not a paradigmatic posture, but something  really solid. At the time, he was teaching the class with Jeff  Silva, and Jeff  and  Lucien would oft en come from opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum, which  gave all of us in the seminar a certain freedom of movement, both theoretically  and in our practice. JPS: What I found really helpful was that one day Lucien and Jeff  would argue  about a project from a seemingly very clear perspective, and the next day they  would shift  their positions and critique the project from a very diff erent angle. We  went through a process of having the conceptual rug pulled out from underneath  us again and again, but while that can be a destabilizing process for awhile, in the  end it allows you to find your own vision. I think the term, “sensory ethnography lab,” is very appropriate, because it’s  a laboratory with tools and space for seeking out the new, for experimentation  and inspiration. Every morning, Lucien comes in with stacks of books, print-outs,  news about art exhibitions—and films to show. You have cameras and micro- phones, equipment, but no one’s telling you that you have to make films this way.  As Véréna [Paravel] suggests, it’s all about experimenting. What becomes most  important for practically everyone involved is producing something with these  tools, and this common emphasis on the creative process makes the experience  feel very democratic. VP: Part of the process is learning the courage to occupy an unsafe position, where  you take risks and oft en receive harsh, blunt criticisms of your tentative, groping  eff orts. Many of us were holding a camera for essentially the first time. Americans are constantly complimenting each other, telling one another  “Great job!”—even in academia, which prides itself on being the space of  contestation and disputation. Th at’s pedagogically worse than useless. You learn  by being unsafe, by losing your footing and bearings, and the way to begin to feel  some slight confidence in what you’re doing is to work through the criticism and  push yourself in ways you wouldn’t have imagined otherwise. JPS: It’s important that you don’t have a safe place, that you don’t have one particu- lar approach or set of conventions to rely on, and that when colleagues talk about  your work, no punches are held. VP: Th e first film I saw on the first day of class was Peleshian’s Th e Seasons [SU,  1975]. And I discovered Dvortsevoy. It was the beginning of a cognitive and  creative revolution for me. Th e class turned out to be the perfect balance of  screening films that provoked you in a multitude of diff erent ways, reading eclectic  302 </page> <page sequence="44"> Interviews works that gave you a theoretical grounding, and getting to play with a camera  and sound recorder, experimenting to figure out new ways to encounter and evoke  the Other. I was also sitting in on Lucien’s course on the history of transcultural  film during the same period. Kidlat Tahimik’s Perfumed Nightmare [PH, 1977]  blew me away. Jean Rouch’s Jaguar [France, 1969] is also way more fucked up and  surreal and revolutionary than most people realize. Jana Ševčíková’s Old Believers  [CS, 2001] made me believe in God for a moment, the closest cinematic analogue  to seeing spirit that I know (Maya Deren’s Divine Horsemen [US, 1953] is a close  second). Robert Gardner’s Forest of Bliss is 90 minutes of transcendental bliss. We  also saw Th e Nuer [Hilary Harris, US, 1971], and the scarification scenes struck me  as some of the strangest and strongest film sequences I’d ever seen. And Vincent  Monnikendam’s archival masterpiece Mother Dao, the Turtlelike [NL, 1995] was  mind-bending, and I adored Richard Rogers’ Quarry [US, 1970] and 226-1690  [US, 1984]. But if had to name just two works from that course that fucked with my mind,  they’d be David Hammons’ Phat Free [US, 1995] and Steve McQueen’s Girls  Tricky [UK, 2001]. Hammons and McQueen are from the art world, which is so  bizarrely cut off  in the U.S. from the soi-disant avant-garde. SM: Stephanie, what aspects of the Sensory Ethnography course were most  important for you? SS: Lucien encouraged us to make work that would have a life outside the  classroom. To enable this, he could be incredibly generous, going to great lengths  to provide the best equipment possible; a number of us were shooting in high  definition video in 2007 when the rest of the department was still working in  standard def. Th is generosity off set the onerousness of the standards he set for himself and  his students, which made him demanding and sometimes, when disappointed,  dismissive. He wasn’t one to commend students for eff ort alone, since what was  most important was the quality of the work. Lucien never explicitly proposed  any one way to shoot or edit, since he wanted students to find their own ways of  making. Th is ambiguity was perhaps conceptually rooted in a critical, maybe even  hostile, skepticism toward purported disciplinary and genre boundaries between  ethnographic film, documentary, and art, each of which has its own brand of  provincialism. Lucien’s opinions about work and his approach to teaching weren’t  agreeable to everyone, but for me his unrelenting insistence that we expect more  from ourselves and our work made him a great teacher. Th e most important aspects of the course for me were its structure, the works  screened and discussed as a class, and the ritual of the group crits. In the spring  303 </page> <page sequence="45"> Scott MacDonald it was a crash course in critical viewing, punctuated by a series of exercises in  recording and editing, plus revision upon revision of treatments for the projects  we were to do in the summer. Th e summer months were transformative for me,  since I focused wholeheartedly on the task of shooting in Nepal. Th e fall was our  time to sort through footage and make something of it, culminating in screenings  in the winter. Th is structure allowed students time to mature as a group and the  opportunity to make strong work as individuals. Over the two semesters we saw  hundreds of films, in class and at the Harvard Film Archive, and we were a ready- made community of critical viewers and thinkers engaging works by filmmakers  and artists such as Peter Hutton, Anri Sala, Steve McQueen, Pedro Costa, Andy  Warhol, James Benning, Jana Ševčíková, Leonard Helmrich, Stephen Breton,  Werner Herzog, David MacDougall, Jean Rouch, Tacita Dean, and Rebecca  Baron (who taught one semester of Sensory Ethnography in spring 2008), among  others. A number of these makers were invited to class. Occasionally they would  participate in the crit sessions, which were critical conversations following  screened rushes or edited work, during which the maker remained silent. Th e  ritual of excluding the maker from the circle made the discussion less personal,  since she was not addressed and made to defend her work, and so the discussion  could be more conceptually driven, as it put emphasis on the work independent  of the maker’s intent or expectations. J. P. SNIADECKI SM: What was the instigation for Songhua? JPS: In the autumn of 2005, just as I was starting the MA at Harvard, a case of  environmental pollution in northeastern China made international headlines. A  plume of nitrobenzene from a processing plant swept through the Songhua River  and flowed on to contaminate the Amur River, which forms a boundary between  China and Russia. Th is kind of accident happens along the Songhua and other  Chinese waterways on an alarmingly regular basis; what drew international atten- tion in this particular case was the fact that the Chinese authorities delayed issuing  a warning not only to the residents of towns and cities along the Songhua within  the Chinese border (most notably, Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province,  where Songhua was filmed) but also to the government and the inhabitants on  the Russian side. Four days aft er the accident, when the Harbin government  realized it had no choice but to report the pollution, I remember reading media  descriptions of city residents flooding into supermarkets and buying out every  available container of drinking water within an hour. 304 </page> <page sequence="46"> Interviews In the summer of 2006, as a member of the first cohort of Sensory Ethnogra- phy, I set out to make a film in collaboration with my Shanghainese friend Ding Yi  that hinged on his parents’ experience as “sent-down” youth in the Great Northern  Wasteland, which lies east of Harbin along the Russian border, and where his  parents were stationed as revolutionaries to serve the people as schoolteachers  and learn from the peasants in the countryside. Th e film I had in mind would follow Ding Yi and his mother as they  journeyed back to this far-flung corner of China and reconnected with her  former students still living there. Another aspect of the film was to explore the  relationship between this shared revolutionary past and the longing felt by Ding  Yi, who came of age during the ever-expanding material culture of the post-1978  economic reforms, for an experience in his own upbringing as intense, galvanizing,  and collective as his parents’ experience. We began shooting in Shanghai, focusing  mostly on Ding Yi’s parents and their friends who were also “sent-down” youth,  conducting informal interviews and gathering footage of conversations about  the past. Both Ding Yi and I were less than enamored with this quasi-talking-heads  format, and reassured ourselves that we would be in the north soon and shooting  more vérité-style scenes. On the long and packed train ride from Shanghai, we  made a stop in Harbin, not only to rest before heading into the Great Northern  Wasteland (which isn’t much of a wasteland now, as it has been transformed  into large tracts of farmland and some industry), but also to visit with Ding Yi’s  mother’s family who still live there. On this layover, my friend Paola, who was accompanying us on the journey  north, and I decided to record images and sounds along the city’s Central Avenue  and the Songhua River, which we had heard about from the nitrobenzene spill  eight months earlier. We followed the bustling avenue to its end, which spills out  onto the river promenade, Stalin Park, along the Songhua River. We wanted to  see the relationship between the city residents and their “mother river,” but this  wasn’t our sole motivation. Paola’s research focused on sound in Chinese society, and I had brought a  Sensory Ethnography sound recorder for her to begin this inquiry. She wanted to  get acquainted with the equipment, and I was still tweaking my preferred settings  for the Panasonic hvx200 camera. Our goal was to pass a day of exploration and  experimentation. It just so happened that this layover day was July 1 , a Saturday  that coincided with the 85th birthday of the Chinese Communist Party (in  Songhua, there is a red banner celebrating the party’s birthday, floating in the water  in the long wide shot of the men fishing with the net in the river). We worked, mostly separately, recording the fishermen, the swimmers, the  picnicking families, the karaoke singers, the kite-flying couples, the BBQ-ing  305 </page> <page sequence="47"> Scott MacDonald Uighuyrs, the horseback riders, and everything under the sun. I was so thrilled  to be shooting something spontaneous that I became totally absorbed. Paola had  to drag me away from the river so that we could keep our dinner plans with Ding  Yi’s family and friends. I went back to the Songhua River the next day and filmed  with the same elation and excitement until the hour of our train’s departure for  the Great Northern Wasteland. When we got to the small city of Yingchun, we were greeted warmly and put  up in an apartment by one of the students of Ding Yi’s mother who was now a  very successful local pharmacist. We were shown around the new schools, public  squares, and roadways, and “handled” at every moment by locals. Constrained  to shoot in a primarily interview format and never allowed to have a moment  to explore on our own, we grew more and more frustrated and fatigued by the  overbearing hospitality of our hosts. Also, over these two weeks, a misunderstanding began to develop between  Ding Yi, his mother, and me around the nature of our collaboration. Ding Yi,  who also brought along his own Handycam, expressed his aspiration to actually  be the film’s director rather than a film-subject. His mother, for her part, revealed  a prepared contract that stated Ding Yi was co-director, she was producer, and  that it would be my responsibility to officially invite Ding Yi to the United States  so that we could edit the film together at Harvard. At this, I decided to end the  collaboration. Ding Yi’s mother demanded the 35 hours of DV tapes I had shot,  claiming that she did not trust me to edit them. Aft er much discussion, I reluc- tantly gave them to her just before Paola and I boarded the train back to Harbin. Paola continued south while I stayed for two weeks along the Songhua River,  recording the scenes you see in the film all day long and, at night, sleeping in a  dingy guesthouse on the other side of town. I was still troubled by the falling  out with Ding Yi and his mother; in hindsight, I can see that the joyful and  liberating shooting experience of Songhua not only helped me recover and make  sense of what had transpired with the failed collaboration but also solidified my  cinematic voice. Songhua is a portrait of a place, comprised of a montage of small  gestures and fleeting moments in public space, free of many of the more sticky  ethical issues and personal entanglements of representation and collaboration.  Th e people, the architecture, the material items along the river did not make  demands on me, and for the most part I did not ask anything of them beyond  being. Th e film hinges on open-ended perception, on a quiet experience of being  and atmosphere, and a meditation on the relationship between the environment  and human development. Since then, all the nonfiction films I’ve made have been motivated by a  sense of place. Songhua, Chaiqian (Demolition), Th e Yellow Bank [US, 2010],  and Foreign Parts have all been responses to a visceral and intuitive attraction  306 </page> <page sequence="48"> Interviews to environments, atmospheres, and urban spaces that are both expressive of  their cultural context, yet also fascinatingly unique: a river park, a worksite, an  architectural waterway, and a New York junkyard. Aft er seeing Ed Pincus’ Diaries [US, 1980] and the work of Alain Cavalier,  I’ve recently been filming things in my daily life—chance encounters or fleeting  moments—although I have no idea what I might do with these diary-like jottings. SM: One of the things shared by many of the films that have come out of the Sen- sory Ethnography Lab, including your Chaiqian, is an interest in physical labor. JPS: Labor is super-interesting for cinema. Th e Lumières filmed people involved  in labor, and Grierson was drawn to it as well. Sensory Ethnography cultivates an  interest in people’s relationship to their environment, and one very obvious way  that people relate to their environment is through their labor. I’d just gotten back to Chengdu aft er being denied access to a film project in  the north of the province, and happened to be walking in the center of the city  when I came across that amazing, yet typical demolition site, the day aft er the  building had been demolished. I began filming with the two crews of workers  (all from Renshou County in Sichuan); they stayed on the site for three weeks,  and I shot during that time. I reconnected with a few of them at another site, and  went back to the village of the man working with the blowtorch (Gao Jianqing),  where I filmed with him and his family, though I didn’t use that material in the  film. I did write about my experiences with Gao Jianqing for Media Fields online  journal [www.mediafieldsjournal.org/beyond-the-frame/2011/2/28/beyond-the- frame-personal-testimony-as-counterdiscourse-in-t.html]. I wanted Chaiqian  (Demolition) to end with the sense of transience, of people moving in and out of  the city and in and out of each other’s lives. SM: Th e opening shot of Chaiqian, in each of the several versions I’ve seen, creates  an optical illusion: a man seems to be sitting on a flat surface on the ground, but  when a worker walks into the image, we realize that the man is actually a distance  above the ground. I read this as a metaphor for the realities of class structure in  China, an issue that comes up several times in the film, including at the end when  the policewoman questions you and the workers. Is that how you understand that  opening shot? JPS: As a relatively vague Marxist and a closet class warrior, I quite like your read- ing. I would imagine, though, that the critique of class in China would be perhaps  more legible, poignant, and concentrated when that opening shot transforms into  the 360-degree pan that moves away from the moment you describe and sweeps  307 </page> <page sequence="49"> Scott MacDonald across the worksite of laborers actually pounding and cleaving concrete from the  valuable, bound-to-be-recycled rebar. Th ere you have the middle-aged migrant  workers, in tank tops and flip-flops, no protective gear or hard hats, bent over their  tools, sweating on the mounds of gray rubble, while the four managers perched  atop of the skate park half-pipe structure stare down on this blow-out battlefield  of demolition which they command. You’re right about the issue of class in China today penetrating practically  each shot of Chaiqian (Demolition) and forming a theme of the film overall. Aft er  all, economic inequality in China is conspicuous and so extreme in degree and  scope that it’s reflected in practically every image one might take of China today. But the pedestrian you mention who reveals the actual depth of the space  by stepping into the frame before this full-circle pan is, in fact, not a worker, but  rather a city resident using the space of the lot opened by the demolition process to  access the other boulevard. I see that illusory moment you describe, when viewers  are surprised that what they took to be a flat ground surface is revealed to be a  much more complex and vacuous space, as a cue or signal as to how to watch the  entirety of the film. Th ings may not be what they seem, and all fields and layers of  the image are activated. Scanning each long-take image, one may discover many  important or compelling details, revelations, or tiny narratives in the corners, in  the slow disclosure of space and event within each shot. SM: In each of the three sections of Sichuan Triptych, a policeman tells you to stop  filming—and it’s clear that at the end of Chaiqian, it’s your camera, the camera  of a visitor to China, that instigates the policewoman’s intervention. What in  general is the experience of filming in China like for you; are these moments  unusual or do they happen regularly—I assume the latter since they become a  motif in Sichuan Triptych. JPS: As a foreigner filming in China, I encounter a range of responses. Sometimes  it is curiosity. In Songhua, for example, there were times when I would be filming  a quiet moment with one person along the river promenade and crowded around  behind me were twenty or thirty people, wondering what the foreigner was up to,  trying to steal a glance through the viewfinder, asking other bystanders what was  going on. And, without fail, every night I went out for a stroll with the workers  from Chaiqian (Demolition)—we went out every night together—a plainclothes  policeman or a security guard or even a citizen on the street would accost us and  either demand to know what I was doing filming these men and women, or, in  some cases, try to prevent me from filming. We would have to explain that we were  friends before these interlopers would leave us alone. Th is is more a matter of “face” in China; these people were trying to protect  308 </page> <page sequence="50"> Interviews the national image of China and believed the foreigner with the camera should  not be focusing on these uneducated migrants from the countryside, but rather  filming the state-of-the-art infrastructure or stories of educated and wealthy  Chinese that would bring international prestige to the country. In situations like  these, I sometimes wish I had another cameraperson filming everything that is  going on behind and around the camera. Such footage might make an interesting  addition to a film, or perhaps could form the subject matter for another film  entirely devoted to these various reactions to the politics of representation. Other times the response is more prohibitive. In terms of these more confron- tational or antagonistic official obstacles to filming in China, I do get stopped,  questioned, and sometimes even forced to erase what I’ve filmed. In addition to  concern over the potential loss of “face” in international media, negative reactions  by people working in an official capacity are usually due to their concern that what  I film will be posted online or used in such a way that may bring reprimand or  punishment. Essentially, they are afraid they will lose their jobs. Th is is entirely  understandable. Unlike some journalists or other filmmakers, I tend not to pursue sensitive  topics or places just for the sake of their status as spectacles or their potential  for causing a stir—but in the process of shooting what I see as necessary for a  particular film project, sometimes these reactions are unavoidable. In fact, I have  encountered this during the shooting of every film, and recently on every shoot  during production of my upcoming film on China’s railway system. Inevitably,  while I’m filming on the trains, the train workers or even the train chief him/ herself will come down upon me and insist I stop filming. Sometimes they even  bring me into their little office on the train and ask to review all the footage and  demand I delete any footage containing train workers or any identifying markers,  such as the train number. Overall, it is hard to know what is considered sensitive or taboo, since  the political climate regularly shift s in China. And all this is mitigated by the  particular sensibility of the individual I am dealing with: some officials are more  paranoid and controlling; others are less concerned. It’s all very ad-hoc. But the  big no-no’s—Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, the Cultural Revolution, and Tiananmen  Square—will always be taboo. SM: How did the three sections of Sichuan Triptych come together? Did you  originally imagine a triptych? JPS: Yes, the film was originally conceived as a three-part film. It was the summer of  2008—the Tibetan uprisings had broken out in March; the earthquake devastated  Sichuan in May; and the Olympics were a month or so away. I arrived in China  309 </page> <page sequence="51"> Scott MacDonald in June aft er the uprisings and the earthquake, and was only going to be there for  three months that summer, so I knew I couldn’t stay in Sichuan for the year or  more and work towards a film that would contain within it a sense of depth and  investment that long-term projects can produce. At the same time, I felt compelled  to respond in some cinematic way to the immensity and tragedy of what had  happened in China in 2008. I felt a particular connection and responsibility to  Sichuan, having spent the previous summer there shooting Chaiqian and working  on a video for a medical exchange program to serve Sichuanese orphans in need  of treatment for orthopedic and burn complications. But what could I do in three  months? I thought it would be interesting to make something elliptical, something  like a visual essay piece—but relying almost entirely on image and sound without  voice-over or explanatory title cards—about the way national events shape the  everyday and, conversely, how the everyday refracts the national event. I still  wanted to work in a mode that allows the lived experience, environment, and  rhythms of the local world shape the film. But I wanted these very localized experi- ences and sensations to be placed in dialogue with the tension of the uprising, the  tragedy of the earthquake, and hubris of the Olympics. It was a bit of a challenge to film the first part of the triptych, which was set  in a small monastery town in a Tibetan area of western Sichuan, because there  was a ban on selling foreigners bus tickets from Chengdu (the provincial capital)  out west to any Tibetan areas of Sichuan. So I had to first take a bus to Ya’an,  the furthest west they would sell, and then find transportation out to the city of  Kangding, where the grasslands and mountains of Greater Tibet begin. To get  even further out into the grasslands, I had to hide on the floor of a minivan that  left  Kangding at 5:00 a.m. in order to blow past the checkpoint. Once I got to the town, which was actually relatively calm during the March  uprisings, the military presence was quite intense and for the first few days I  tried to lay low and keep my shooting to a minimum. As time went on, though,  I became more and more bold (or maybe just more and more impatient), and  filmed more oft en and more openly. I was surprised when the only reprove I  attracted was the scene included in the film when the young soldier jogs over to  me and asks me politely not to film his platoon doing exercises. Th is is totally  understandable, because filming the military is illegal in most every country I can  think of, including China. For the second part, I worked with the same organization for which I made  the medical exchange video. I volunteered to help with donations to a school in  Qingchuan, a county in northern Sichuan that was hard-hit by the earthquake.  At the time, all the New York Times articles were coming out about the shoddy  school construction and enraged parents seeking justice. In this climate, access  310 </page> <page sequence="52"> Interviews to the disaster site and the ability to film were extremely restricted. As soon as  we showed up in Qingchuan, the local officials were on top of us and held us for  questioning for a few hours. I was only able to shoot 20 minutes of footage there,  and most of it ended up in the second part of the triptych. Th e final part of the film was much less complicated to film, as the migrant  worker and his peasant family you see depicted are actually friends I made on the  worksite while filming Chaiqian (Demolition). I begin with the father—who is  actually the man who praises the camera’s functions during an evening meal in  Chaiqian (Demolition)—working on the demolition site of a school severely dam- aged during the earthquake. Th e Olympic torch is supposed to pass nearby (and  the gathered crowd actually never gets to see it, because the security surrounding  the torch was so tight that they constantly rerouted the torch’s itinerary and only  official invitees were able to catch sight of it), but he is too busy working to join the  expectant crowds. Later, we follow him to his countryside home outside the city  and he sprays his rice fields, prepares dinner for his family, and sits down with some  beer and rice wine to watch the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games. SM: What the three films have in common is a focus on aspects of Chinese life  that are international issues or events: you provide a sense of how these big issues  aff ect “people on the street.” JPS: Yes, that was the goal from the beginning. I had been reading the work of  anthropologist Veena Das, who has done fascinating studies on how national  events and tragedies in India (for example, the 1948 Partition, as well as the  assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 and the subsequent anti-Sikh riots) ripple  into daily experience, weaving raw pain and a grinding, droning form of social  suff ering into the fabric of the everyday. In terms of film form, I was also interested in challenging myself (and the  audience) with a rather open-ended treatment of the relationship between the  large-scale event, the local ecology, and the “people on the street” or in the fields,  as it were. Oft entimes, when you bring conceptually abstract and disparate things  together, there can be pressure to designate clear connections, causal relationships,  and definite propositions. Sometimes the results of such moves of delimitation are  illuminating; other times, they seem like an awkward reaching towards something  untenable. I wanted the film to have an atmosphere of possible meanings that were  subtle, less ambitious, and grounded in the triangular experience of the filmmaker,  film subject, and film viewer. SM: Th e final shot in Sichuan Triptych is loaded with implication. We see the  little girl “singing” the Chinese national anthem to open the Olympics, on a  311 </page> <page sequence="53"> Scott MacDonald tiny television in a humble worker’s home. Again, the class issue is apparent—as  is the gap between the immensely high-tech, spectacular opening of the games,  probably the most high-tech in history, and the very low-tech world of manual  labor. Your camera contemplates the space of the man’s home, which includes the  tiny black-and-white television on which we see the spectacular opening of the  Olympics—three layers of reality, and three layers of time, in one. I also see a declaration of cinematic principle here: your one-person method  of making media is as far from the elaborate production of the games as is the  working man’s home—and the shot suggests that you stand with the worker,  as opposed to the New China represented by the Beijing Olympics and by the  worldwide media system that broadcast the games. JPS: Well, in that shot, I am literally standing/sitting in the living room with  my friend, the migrant worker. And, yes, my rather lo-fi, personal approach to  filmmaking is a far cry from Zhang Yimou’s lavish opening ceremony. But that  final sequence of shots in Sichuan Triptych is loaded with not just one implication,  but rather with many possible implications. Th is ambiguity, rather than nailing  down a singular meaning, raises questions and leaves space for multiple (and  even competing) interpretations and inquiries. Th e little girl, who reportedly  hails from Sichuan, is actually lip-synching the national anthem as that adorable  congregation of children—each selected as a representative of one of China’s 56  ethnic minorities—carry the national flag to the PLA soldiers, thus demonstrating  national ethnic harmony. Th is moment not only refers back to the two earlier segments of the trip- tych—the PLA soldiers receiving the flag recall the military drill march through  the “ethnic” Tibetan town, and the singer’s Sichuan origin serves as an homage  to the earthquake—but also raises questions about official representation of  the nation-state in China: How is it conceived? What is authentic? What can  be trusted? Who is speaking for whom? And, as you pointed out, we view this  national spectacle of ascendancy and harmony through the poor TV reception  of a small, gritty screen in a peasant’s rural home. But, in addition to registering the stark contrast between the power and pomp  of the ceremony and the modest living conditions of my friend, it is important to  note that this shot can also be construed in another, perhaps countervailing way.  China’s economic miracle would not be possible without the back-breaking labor  my friend from the countryside contributes to urban growth, and he is singing  along with the national anthem, enjoying a celebratory meal he earned with his  urban labor, perhaps feeling somehow a part of the big Olympic party in Beijing.  Th is pride can be read as a testament to the degree to which the standard of living  and the opportunities for economic improvement in individual lives in China  312 </page> <page sequence="54"> Interviews have increased in the past thirty years. Party supporters would point out that this  is all due to its leadership, and detractors would say it is in spite of it. Regardless,  I wanted all these possible meanings to operate in that final shot. STEPHANIE SPRAY SM: Stephanie, what motivates you to work on the particular subjects you choose? SS: Th is is a surprisingly difficult question, Scott. In Kale and Kale, Monsoon- Reflections, and As Long as Th ere’s Breath, I focused on the everyday lives of antihe- roes, people who get by in life by tolerating rather than overcoming their problems.  I gravitated toward some of these subjects not because they have the usual kind  of charisma you find in many documentary subjects, but rather what I saw as the  filmic discernibility of the weight of their being—for lack of a less clunky phrase  (I believe the subject who most exemplifies this is Bindu, the middle-aged woman  and field hand in Monsoon-Reflections and As Long as Th ere’s Breath). In my work, I’ve been interested in how this quality can be evinced through  subtle movements and expressions and perhaps conveys a sense of “realness” or  personhood that unsettles presumptions about cultural or racial diff erence and  the inequalities they perpetuate. I’ve sometimes thought that these films off er  an implicit criticism of the thinness of most representations of poverty in the  “third world,” but that’s an aft ereff ect rather than a guiding logic or motivation  for me. I hope that, if the films are about anything, they’re not about moralizing  or reeducating so-called Western audiences (although it’s okay if they do that),  but something much more basic about experience itself. Why this is important to me, I’m not sure. I do think that the aesthetic of  these films is, to a degree, inherently political and posthumanistic, but I’m not sure  if that is what motivates my work at its core. An additional and implied subject in  these three films, and maybe all my work, has been time itself, about how its texture  varies as it unfolds in the moving image and in our lives, which is one reason why  I’ve kept my shots relatively long. Of course, much of this is an intellectual explanation of what is simpler in  practice. I’m frequently motivated by the joy of experiencing the world through  the camera, or what Jean Rouch called the cine-trance, which I think is most  evident in Untitled. I love how the frame allows me to reorder and direct experi- ence, opening up new possibilities for knowing. Using the camera as an extension  of the body in this way is physically challenging, at times exhausting, but also  exhilarating. SM: In Kale and Kale, how fully are you meaning to play against assumptions? For  313 </page> <page sequence="55"> Scott MacDonald some American viewers, the two men would look like potheads; is your gradual  way of revealing their spiritual dimensions partly a way of teasing out the viewer’s  prejudices? SS: Th e structure of the video is built to work against assumptions and stereo- types; however, I was more concerned with caste stereotyping than I was about  whether or not the uncle and nephew would be perceived as potheads. Both  Kales are Gāine, a caste of “untouchables” who traditionally play the sarangi,  the stringed instrument you see at the end of Kale and Kale. I wanted the piece  to unfold in such a way that it would emphasize their lives in the village, where  they can carry themselves with more dignity than when, crouched at some  stranger’s doorway, they beg for a living. In Nepal, marijuana is associated with  the dreadlocked god Shiva, who is said to smoke in the Himalaya; and it has  other religious connotations. So I wasn’t fixated on smoking marijuana as a taboo  to exploit, but as a fact of their lives within a cultural context that, admittedly,  I don’t care to explain to the audience. Of course, the two men do smoke an  inordinate amount of weed and cigarettes, and I could barely get a shot without  a pipe or a dangling cigarette. I suppose I’ve always thought of what you refer to as their spiritual dimension  as their humanity, which I wanted to illustrate in their relationships with one  another and with me, the cameraperson. When I made Kale and Kale, I hoped  that my camerawork would somehow evoke some of this. SM: What is the name of the ritual that occurs well into this piece, where the  off screen voice says “Put it on auntie too”? SS: Th e young woman who gives me the red dot (called a tikka in Nepali, tilak in  Hindi) is the younger Kale’s daughter; she is a regular vessel for the goddess Kalika,  who inhabits her body from time to time to send messages and make predictions.  Th e girl had just done puja, a ritual to an image or embodiment of a deity (a rock  or statue—what Christians call idols) that can involve all of the senses—recall the  end of Forest of Bliss; that’s puja. I don’t mean to lead you astray with the goddess possession stuff , since anyone  can do puja. Th e main point is that the food off ered to gods or goddesses, fre- quently fruits and sweets (there’s animal sacrifice in Nepal, so meat too), are then  given away to humans as blessed food, called prasad, and through its consumption  a person is more fully and physically connected to the goddess. I’ve heard tikkas  explained as blessings and as a kind of souvenir, an outward sign of that blessing. I’m not Hindu, was raised Pentecostal, but am nothing at all now—a  recovered hardcore teenage Christian. 314 </page> <page sequence="56"> Interviews SM: I assume you shot the material you use in Monsoon-Reflections and As Long  As Th ere’s Breath over a long period of time, though you use the cycle of the day  as an organizing principle. SS: I’ve always thought that the two movies run a bit outside of time or against  time; some of the shots are rather long (especially for the subject matter and quasi- narrative structures) and are concerned with mundane activities (I’m interested  in subtle facial expressions and body language) and when pieced together they  could represent one day, or not. It’s been my hope that the videos give a sense of the way time can drag on in  these villages, the way time is filled or killed with hanging around—epitomized by  the long smoke break—and by doing extended, banal tasks such as grooming. Here  in Nepal, people speak of “time pass,” using the English words, which designates  a category of activity that allows one to cope with the burden of time, which to  me feels at once lighter and yet thicker than time in the U.S. Monsoon-Reflections  or As Long As Th ere’s Breath could be one day or several days, but the main idea  is that days oft en blend together, especially since some subjects seem to have lost  the will to keep track of the details of calendric time. SM: Why the hyphen in the title of Monsoon-Reflections? SS: Th e title is a translation of the equivalent title “varshaa-vichaar” from a Nepali  epic poem, Reflections on the Seasons, by Lekhnath Paudyal [written 1916, pub- lished 1934]. Hyphens are used throughout the Nepali-language poem to make  compounds, which are called samaasaas in Sanskrit (where they are normally  not hyphenated). Since Nepali is a modern language, and the poem is relatively  “modern,” hyphens are used throughout to help contemporary Nepali readers deal  with extended multisyllabic compounds, such as “theruttingelephantbespeckled- withpearllikedots,” which are a hallmark of Sanskrit but difficult to make sense of  today in Nepali or Hindi. Hence, varshaa-vichaar (“monsoon-reflections”) and  not varshaavichaar (“monsoonreflections”). I retain the hyphen for the video as  a subtle, if not obscure, reference to Paudyal’s poems. SM: Are you still shooting film? SS: Most certainly still shooting, loving it, and not planning to stop anytime  soon. Recently I worked with a collaborator, Pacho Velez, on the production of  a super-16mm film on the one and only cable car in Nepal (it goes to and from  the temple of the wish-fulfilling goddess) [Manakamana, US, 2013]. We’ve  jokingly been calling it “ethnographic sci-fi” and, if the film doesn’t self-destruct,  315 </page> <page sequence="57"> Scott MacDonald it should be strange and fun. In our conversations, we’ve been thinking about  it quite formally—as a series of extended shots portraying individual trips with  diff erent passengers inside 5' × 5' cable cars, structured over the course of a single  cable car day, lunch break and all. A single trip is roughly the length of a roll of  film, so extended shots should work nicely. We cast Bindu, Bhakte and my Nepali  moms (from Monsoon-Reflections and As Long as Th ere’s Breath) and a number of  people who we met along the way, including two babas and a bride and groom.  It’s borderline fiction, although you could also call it documentary. We plan to  start editing in January. I am still working with the family from Monsoon-Reflections and As Long as  Th ere’s Breath and hope to make a longer piece in the next year or two. I’m trying  to find other ways to depict “time pass,” as well as Bhakte’s alcoholism and Chet’s  bitter depressions, with a compassionate eye, and in such a way that they maintain  a kind of onscreen dignity. I feel that if there is any redemption from the darker  sides of these two personalities, it is found in Bindu’s admirable strength. I feel  that I’ve just skimmed the surface with Monsoon-Reflections and As Long as Th ere’s  Breath, so I’d like to try once more to see if I can get it “right.” I am forging ahead, but definitely look forward to doing more work close to  “home,” where I can work without so much of the power/image politics mixed  with guilt or the wondering if I should feel guilty when I don’t, which is also  perhaps why I’m so much looking forward to the cable car film: for once it’s not  about the suff ering of brown people, but about holiday time, wish fulfillment, and  cool technologies: Aaton film cameras and Austrian cable cars (we borrowed the  Aaton that Gardener used for Forest of Bliss from the Film Study Center). SM: Earlier you mentioned James Benning; your work with sound oft en evokes  his films. SS: Yes, his films made a strong impression. 13 Lakes was the first that I saw, and is  a favorite, and I had the good fortune to see the other Benning films that played  at the Harvard Film Archive a few years ago. As a kind of homage to 13 Lakes,  I’ve been working on a sound project about the lakes of the Pokhara Valley, but  with a twist: I’m primarily interested in what lies under the surface—literally, as  well as metaphorically and acoustically (I use hydrophones). I plan to compose  the pieces with reference to local stories about drownings and malevolent water  spirits. Called 7 Lakes, it will be the dark, twisted sister to 13 Lakes (the serenity  of which Benning pierces here and there with sound—the gunshots in the  Crater Lake shot, for example). I’m also working on a sound project focused on  the growing glacial lakes of the Khumbu region, including the Gokyo lakes and  Imja Tsho. 316 </page> <page sequence="58"> Interviews Véréna Paravel and J.P. Sniadecki on Foreign Parts SM: What was the instigation for Foreign Parts? VP: At the end of the spring Sensory Ethnography seminar in 2008, others were  going to exotic places: Shanghai, Timbuktu, the Nile . . . but for me Queens, New  York, was a paradigm of exoticism. Ever since moving to New York, I’ve been  fascinated by the Number 7 subway line through Queens, which passes through  the neighborhoods of about a hundred and fift een diff erent nationalities and  ethnic groups. JPS: It’s maybe the most diverse space in the world. VP: Originally I had the idea of making an essentially anti-ethnographic film that  would foreground ephemeral encounters, fortuitous interactions between people  and places as I walked the full twelve miles under the Number 7 tracks. I would  go traveling the world in my own backyard. With this idea in mind, I started walking in Flushing and immediately the  experience of walking-cum-filming was totally diff erent from what I had expected.  I felt totally there and totally empowered. I was filming everyone and everything.  Sometimes people would come up to me to be filmed. One guy was handing out  flyers and when he saw me filming, without saying a word, he removed his shirt  and began to dance in front of me, and soon I was filming his torso from maybe  five centimeters away. Later, without saying a word, a woman opened her shirt  to show me a scar that went all the way down her body. Th e camera and I were  perhaps the catalyst for such craziness, and at times I felt like all the excess and  insanity I was witnessing was beginning to inhabit me too. SM: Th is is the material that became 7 Queens? VP: Right. I finished it in 2008 in the fall seminar. I film and shoot still images obsessively; it’s almost a disease with me. I’m less  interested nowadays in working with words, especially of the academic, discursive  kind, than I am with sequences of images and sounds. We are, aft er all, imagistic  creatures before we are linguistic ones. We all inhabit, are also inhabited by, frag- ments of imagery, of sounds, of partial memories, of sensations, felt, remembered  and misremembered. Images of all kinds loom far larger in our cognitive and  corporeal makeup than good English or French—than sentential language.  Working with a camera and sound recorder gives me far freer reign to delve into  all this unruly wealth of sensorial material than huddling over a keyboard. 317 </page> <page sequence="59"> Scott MacDonald As for what motivates my choices of subject, it’s hard to say. I don’t think any  of us really knows. Th e real reasons are more unconscious than conscious. But I  think there are always at least three factors in the mix for me. Th e first is, no matter  how interesting something may be on paper, or as an articulated theme, there has  to be a strong aesthetic dimension to it if I am to be drawn to it cinematically. Th e second is that I respond to the world filming, much as I do when doing  ethnographic fieldwork: I surrender to it body and soul. It colonizes my whole  being, which takes a huge toll on me, but is also what makes both filming and  fieldwork, at their best, so fulfilling. My life ends up conjoining with the lives of  my subjects, and in the process I end up confronting myself, and all of my anxieties  and obsessions, at the same time as I confront the world outside me. And thirdly, there also has to be an intellectual aspect to the subject that  intrigues me, that surpasses my aesthetic and corporeal engagement—something  that sparks my curiosity, or a desire to make connections between the visible  and the invisible, or the personal and the public, or the poetic and the political.  Th at said, I have no interest in making films that seek to answer a question; I’m  not a “militant,” as we say in France, an activist who wears her politics on her  blouse—issue-based films generally leave me cold. SM: One characteristic of many of the films that have come out of the Sensory  Ethnography Lab is the particular attention to the soundtrack. In 7 Queens, as in  Foreign Parts and J.P.’s films, the sound is multilayered and dramatically expands  the world revealed in the imagery. Is it fair to say that when you two are drawn to  subjects it’s as much for how they sound as for how they look? VP: Basically, when I approach a subject—people, a place—I’m constantly inter- rogating myself about how to access it on multiple levels. And to be sure, acoustic  connections are as important for me, as alive in my mind, as vibrant in my body,  as those we deem exclusively visual. Th ere are as many acoustic protrusions to a  person or a place that one can attach oneself to cinematically, as there are visual  or tactile protrusions. Right now, I’m working with Lucien on a new project about commercial  fishing out of New Bedford, and spending a lot of time on one-hundred-foot  groundfish dragger and scalloper boats out in the Atlantic, and in many ways it’s  the sound of the boat at sea—its incessant engine, the winches, the waves, and the  boat’s wake—that determine how I respond and react, and so shape the rhythm  and tone of what and how I’m filming. I should add that Ernst Karel, who also works at the Sensory Ethnography  Lab, and mixed 7 Queens and Foreign Parts, has really taught me how to hear—his  318 </page> <page sequence="60"> Interviews minimalist aesthetic and the rigor with which he listens to the world have marked  my work. JPS: Sound has an allure all its own, and in all projects I am equally focused on  sound and image. Sound-making (and recording) is also place-making, because  sound both flows from and floods into bodies and environments, forming a kind  of sonic orientation and meaning. SM: What exactly spurred your interest in Willets Point? VP: I was shooting 7 Queens and happened upon and started filming an old car  being literally shaken apart by a forklift  truck. Th at encounter, that shot, ended  up becoming the first shot of Foreign Parts, and led me into the whole maze of  auto shops that make up the junkyard at Willets Point. When I first entered the  junkyard, someone told me it was too dangerous for me to be in there—and I  immediately knew this was going to be the subject of a film. From then on, I came  back to Willets Point obsessively and started to get to know people. What intrigued me from the get-go were all the contradictions I witnessed  there—for me, the U.S. is an automobile culture, with both the putative freedoms  and the imprisonment that cars represent in American history. Cars in the  junkyard were at once being deconstructed and reconstructed—recycled into  an infinity of fragments and spare parts, and also serving as shelters, as homes  even, for many of the “homeless” inhabitants I found there. Cars as shrines to the  culture of the country, its ethos of individualism, freedom, and conquest, but also  as detritus, as rejects, as garbage—which is just the way the politicians and city of  New York look at the people who scrape out a living there. JPS: When I first went to Willets Point with Véréna, we hadn’t worked out how  the collaboration would go; we just started, and immediately the camera was  floating between us with no problem. I remember one particular shot early on,  made with the camera on a tripod. We were shooting a wall of rear-view mirrors  and we framed a shot together, focusing in on one particular mirror, just as a guy  working there walked into the mirror’s reflection and sat down, perfectly framed.  We looked at each other and knew this was going to work out. SM: Foreign Parts goes through the four seasons; how much time did the two of  you spend at Willets Point? VP: While shooting 7 Queens, I spent almost all of that summer there, alone. And  319 </page> <page sequence="61"> Scott MacDonald then J.P. and I spent the better part of two years going down there whenever we  could find the time. JPS: We’d go back at least every month, sometimes twice a month. Of course, we  would have preferred to live in New York, but at the beginning we couldn’t aff ord  it. Plus, Véréna has two kids and a husband, and I had my PhD coursework to do,  and at the time, Demolition was getting screened in festivals, so I was traveling.  We’d take the bus 5 hours from Boston, drop our stuff  at some friend’s place, go  straight to the junkyard, shoot all day, take the subway back to Brooklyn, sleep on  our friends’ floors, wake up at six and do the same thing the next day. We went every month for a year and a half. Well into the process we got some  funding from the LEF Foundation, and were able to rent a room in Flushing and  spend a full six weeks at Willets Point. SM: Were you always shooting when you were at the junkyard? Shooting video,  you can easily end up with 500 hours of footage. JPS: We filmed quite a bit, but we oft en put the camera down and hung out with  people. We didn’t have a plan for this, like we’re gonna hang out for six months  without the camera and take notes, then turn on the camera (which can be an  eff ective way to make certain films). People work very hard at Willets Point, and  work ethic is respected. To fit in, we needed some sort of labor to do. So, from the  very beginning, we figured we’d just dive in and get to work; for us, filming and  recording sound feels more like work than writing on a notepad with a pencil. Some days we would hang out all day and shoot for 4 hours; other days,  we would shoot 4 minutes—it just depended on the dynamics of the days. We  definitely spent a lot of time not filming, sometimes drinking and talking until  very late at night, probably later than we should have stayed (Willets Point can  be a dangerous area at night). SM: A characteristic of many of the Sensory Ethnography Lab films is the relaxed  way in which they negotiate the presence of the filmmaker filmmaking. JPS: It’s not my impression that we all agreed not to eliminate the presence of the  filmmaker from the film. Th ere was a particular moment in the development of  anthropology when the field critiqued itself for not bringing forth the positional- ity of the ethnographer, which led to the “reflexive turn” where, instead of writing  themselves out, anthropologists were including their reactions and their emotions  and background and presence in their work. Th at said, I don’t think that reflexive moves or involving the presence of  320 </page> <page sequence="62"> Interviews the filmmaker is automatic within Sensory Ethnography, nor do I think that  anthropologists are the only ones who are working reflexively. VP: When we were filming Foreign Parts, we oft en had discussions about how to  proceed, and if and how we might enter the film. We were open to everything;  nothing was verboten and nothing was preordained. We tried to follow the  rhythm and the pace and the gestures of the place. It seemed wrong to us to play the game of pure observational cinema à la  Wiseman, where theoretically there is nobody behind the camera. We didn’t  want to saddle the film with the weight of a fabricated absence. We were always  trying to be shaped by the place, more than trying to impose an approach, a style,  an idea on the place. JPS: It’s a question of being in a position of receptivity where you are marked by the  people in the place you’re filming. When I first started to make Demolition, I didn’t  want anything to do with self-reflexive filmmaking. I’d seen a number of films that  had what seemed to be a token reflexive moment, and I didn’t like them—as if  you could put a little bit of your voice here and there and be somehow absolved  of some ethical dilemma by acknowledging your presence. I’d come to feel that  my earlier film, Songhua, would have been better if you hadn’t heard my voice. I  don’t feel that way now, but at the time of shooting Chaiqian (Demolition), I was  going to keep my voice and my presence out. But even early on, my approach in Chaiqian was to let the experience of being  there in that place shape the way I was making the film. As it turned out, conversa- tions between the workers and me became part of the experience, and it would  have been totally disingenuous to cut those moments out. If reflexivity happens  to trigger or ignite or activate, if it produces something useful or interesting for  the film, why say it’s off  limits? Every shot carries the cinematographer’s sensibility  and emotional state in some way. SM: How much footage of Willets Point did you end up with? VP: 150 hours. JPS: As we shot, we would watch the rushes and log as much as we could. We cut  a trailer early on, and to do that we looked at a lot of the stuff  on tape. When we  received the LEF funding, we started shooting high def, so in the end we were  working with two diff erent formats. At a certain point, Véréna said, “We’re done shooting; we have to edit; we  have to finish this film,” which was probably a good call, although I feel as though  321 </page> <page sequence="63"> Scott MacDonald we could have filmed for a few more years. We stopped shooting exactly when we  were starting to express certain, less obvious layers of Willets Point. Th en we watched all 150 hours twice . . . VP: And cut the material down to 40 hours . . .  JPS: Th en very quickly we made an eleven-hour assembly. VP: At the end, we were editing 8–9 hours a day, using Final Cut Pro. JPS: Th en I went to China, and we continued editing by email, sending files back  and forth. When we got down to the two-hour mark, we had to think about the bal- ance of many diff erent elements. What was most challenging for us was how to  disclose and deal with the political backdrop of Willets Point, which could easily  have colonized the film and taken away from the other aspects of the place that  we wanted to communicate. I don’t know that we struck the right balance; we  went back and forth about it, up until the very end, when we had a deadline for a  screening at the Locarno festival. VP: What was guiding me was the idea of making a film juste—I don’t know how  to say that in English. A film that was just, fair, adequate to its subject, that found  the proper balance between all the themes I was trying to pursue. We needed to  arrive at the right ratio between the car as creature and the human creature. SM: During recent decades, there’s been a lot of discussion about the ethics of  filming other people, a discussion that can ignore certain realities. I think my  favorite moment in Foreign Parts is when the guy doing a sort of horsey dance  performs for the camera, then says, “Th ank you,” as he leaves. We forget how  important it is to be noticed and to feel noticed. VP: Th ank you for saying that. I’m really happy about that shot. It’s a quintessential  7 Queens moment—a kind of spontaneous combustion that came out of an  accidental encounter. Th e man’s performance has a beauty to it because of his agency and his  confidence in front of the camera, and because it happened by serendipity rather  than by hard work on our part—it’s not as if we won his acceptance through two  years of patient, earnest ethnographic fieldwork whereby we sought to insinuate  ourselves into a position of invisibility that would get him and everyone else to  forget about the camera and numbly accept our presence. In a sense, there’s a whole  322 </page> <page sequence="64"> Interviews world encapsulated in that one shot, all the comprehension and miscomprehen- sion that unites and divides people from each other, all the complexity of his  being, and simultaneously the impossibility of communication between people.  It’s dialogical, but at the same time a false dialogue. What comes out of his mouth  is more guttural than verbal. Th e shot deploys all the stages of the interpersonal encounter: approach,  seduction, exchange, gift  and counter-gift , and finally abandonment. He interpo- lates us, he has an a priori conception of what a camera is, what it can do, what it  does despite itself, and what, for that brief moment of play, he can do with it—for  himself, for us, for unseen others. He off ers us something, he off ers the world  something, in his performance. And at the end—this is the abandonment—he  escapes from us, and also from the film, and from the spectators who would  imprison him within the carapace of a cinematic character. He surpasses the film,  as all human beings do in the end. JPS: Th at gentleman, who goes by the nickname of Crazy Horse by the way, is in  some sense the director of that scene; he’s the one calling the shots. We were just  in a stance of being open to what he wanted us to see. SM: Did the Willets Point people get to see the film? JPS: Th e unofficial (but for us official) premiere was in the junkyard, and the  interaction between the film and those who came to the screening was kind of  amazing. Almost everyone who was in the film saw it. At the time when the film  was premiering, Luis was back in prison. But everyone else who had any kind of  role in the film and also many people who weren’t in the film came to the screening  that we’d organized with UnionDocs and Rooft op Productions. Th ey helped us  bring a screen, a PA system, and a projector to Willets Point. People would stand  up and holler when they’d see one of their friends or when they’d see themselves  in the film. VP: Actually, Foreign Parts came alive to me, became a film, the day we showed it  in the junkyard. JPS: We were pretty anxious about what the response would be. But during the  screening, Marco, who owns the diner and is in the film, leans over and goes, “Ah,  it’s beautiful. You captured all the rhythms and beauties of this place.” We were  surprised and excited that he found our approach and aesthetic pleasing, thinking  he might have been anticipating a more activist film. 323 </page> <page sequence="65"> Scott MacDonald VP: I think he, and the others too, understood what we were trying to do, and I  think they appreciated the film and recognized themselves in this portrait. People from Willets Point also came to the New York Film Festival screening  the next day, and later, to the MoMA screening. At the end of the New York Film  Festival screening, I asked Julia, the little woman you see dancing sometimes,  “How was it?” and she said, “I slept so well.” I think she enjoyed just being there;  she’d been living in a van for seventeen years. And there was a very beautiful  moment at MoMA, with Joe, the one legal resident of Willets Point. He was  sitting at the back. Somebody asks us a question and suddenly Joe is standing up,  answering the question, and everybody is listening to him. At the end, somebody  thanks us for the film, and as I’m about to answer, Joe takes the microphone and  says, “Th ank you!” It was his film too. SM: I understand you two are planning a new project. JPS: Yes, we’re planning, scheming, looking for money. In south China there’s an  island called Hainan, and on that island there’s a town called Haikou. I found a  building with an abandoned lot right behind a good friend’s house. It’s a concrete  slab shell where a bunch of Miao migrants (in English we would say Hmong) from  south China, northern Laos, and Vietnam have moved to reclaim this space and  make it their own. Th ey’ve built living quarters in there, and they go out into the  city to collect plastic bottles for recycling. In and of itself, this is fascinating, but  there’s also a gigantic sand mound next to the area—they go to the ocean once a  week and dig up sand to deposit there and then sell to construction places (actually  not such a good idea because salt in the sand is bad for cement). Th e children play  on this sand mound, transforming it into a playground. So we’re going to work on  a film about Miao migrants, recycling, and the magical sandbox of the imagination. Castaing-Taylor and Paravel on Leviathan SM: I understand that originally you thought you were making a more broad- ranging film about the fishing industry in and around New Bedford. At what  point did you know you wanted to film on fishing boats as a major project, and  what were the difficulties in having the opportunity to do that? LC-T/VP: Filming in New Bedford, in and around the harbor, started, occasionally  and intermittently, during the summer and fall of 2011, and in earnest during  the winter. Th e initial idea was to make a film about fishing, and the ocean more  broadly, without ever seeing, or at least recognizing, a fishing boat or the sea. We  324 </page> <page sequence="66"> Interviews first went out to George’s Bank on a dragger in March 2012. Aft er that first trip,  we quickly lost interest in the land; it seemed altogether too familiar. Most captains we met in port were very welcoming, intrigued by our interest,  and invited us to go out with them. Th ere were no real difficulties in doing so. SM: It must have been obvious to both of you, almost from the beginning, that  you weren’t going to make a documentary about industrial ocean fishing, or a  TV-like melodrama about the men who work on fishing boats, but something  very diff erent—something that would be less informational in the usual sense  than experiential, a kind of virtual voyage. LC-T/VP: Fishing is perhaps the most photographed endeavor in the history of  photography and cinema—from Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, Robert  Flaherty and John Grierson, all the way up to Allan Sekula, Discovery Channel’s  Th e Deadliest Catch [Discovery Channel, US, 2005– ] and Th e Cove [Louie  Psihoyos, US, 2009]. Th e vast majority of this tradition indulges in the kinds of  sentimentality and romanticism that one knows all too well, or else fits smugly  into the agit prop liberal public television victimhood tradition, both of which  we knew from the get-go we had to avoid. SM: In Sweetgrass, the subject was the interplay between cowboys and sheep, what  Lucien has called “sheeple”; and in Foreign Parts, the focus is the personalities  within an industrial space. In Leviathan the focus seems to have a double level:  first, you focus on a modern or late-modern version of a centuries old industrial  process; and second, you seem to be focusing on a new kind of documentary  experience. Did your assumption that you were going to be working in a new way  develop quickly once you were out on the fishing boats? LC-T/VP: We weren’t hell-bent on creating a new kind of “documentary experience”  any more than we were interested in slavishly following or subverting dominant  rules and regulations of filmmaking. We were trying to grapple with the magni- tude of what we were confronted with, both inside and outside ourselves, when  out at sea. Does filming fishing demand anything, any more than filming anything else  does? Subject doesn’t dictate style. One’s style is borne out of one’s encounter with  one’s subject. Yet many films, especially nonfiction films, seem to go to great pains  to render that encounter invisible. Neither of us is interested in cinema as sheer  spectacle, a distraction, a form of enter- or infotainment. We’re interested in the  world, and how to render the world’s aesthetic due, whether or not that ends up  325 </page> <page sequence="67"> Scott MacDonald conforming to the norms and forms of cinematic or other artistic conventions as  they congeal at any one point in time. If Leviathan represents for some people a new kind of cinematic experience,  as they’ve claimed, it is perhaps simply because the film returns us to some of the  imperatives of cinema at its inception, allowing us to apprehend the world anew, to  shake us out of both our dogmatic and perceptual slumbers, to rid us momentarily  of the habitual blinkers and moralistic alibis which burden our socially sanctioned  everyday lives. SM: I know from talking with the two of you over the past couple of years that the  labors of recording the material for Leviathan were considerable—if not as gruel- ing as working as fishermen, difficult in other ways. Could you each talk about  what you physically and psychologically went through while shooting the film? VP: Th e boat contained many of my deepest fears, if not phobias: being trapped in  a highly claustrophobic space, with no possible way to escape either from the men  or the unrelenting engine noise, or the menacing, dark sea, constantly sensing the  deep and unknown below me. Despite all that, I felt pretty much at ease to move  about on the boat. Unfortunately aft er several days of rough seas, my body could  no longer handle the pressure and on each trip I ended up covered with bruises  and immobilized, having put my back out. LC-T: I had never been seasick before and didn’t anticipate having any problem  with it, even though Véréna had an intuition that I would. I basically puked my  guts out for the first 24–48 hours of each trip. I tried various antiemetics, which  induced diff erent degrees of stupor in me and even made me see double, which  didn’t particularly help matters. Th e boat was all-imposing, oddly claustrophobic, with no relief anywhere— very loud, not especially sea-worthy, no real privacy. SM: It seems clear from both your earlier films—particularly the approach used in  7 Queens by you, Véréna, and Lucien, your cinematography on Sweetgrass—that  each of you brought diff erent tendencies and skills to the production. How did you two develop the collaboration between you? From the begin- ning did you assume both of you would shoot and edit? Was the collaboration a  struggle at any point and if so, when and why? LC-T/VP: We were clueless; we never really had any fixed idea of what the col- laboration would be. We’d collaborated before in various ways in the Sensory  Ethnography Lab, co-teaching and so on, but had never completed a long-form  326 </page> <page sequence="68"> Interviews film together. Th ere was never any division of labor. We just worked intuitively,  discussing at once nothing and everything. We brainstormed together, sulked  together, shot together, reshot together, edited together. It was all more or less  instinctive, and unpredictable. One day, one of us would argue against the other;  the next, the positions would be reversed, or one would be arguing with him/ herself. Part of this was born out of necessity: the boat was very unstable, and we  had to look out for each other, not only so that we didn’t fall overboard or get hit  on the head with a cable or a hook, but also so we could take turns holding one  another when the other was filming, to help stabilize the image. SM: How many trips did you take, what cameras did you use, how much film  did you shoot, and how did the shooting process evolve over the time when you  filmed? LC-T/VP: Between land and sea we probably shot around 250 hours of footage. Once  we lost interest in land, we jettisoned maybe 100 hours of that material. We took  six trips out to sea of between 9 days and 3 weeks. We never knew how long they  would last, any more than the captain did—it would depend on the weather, their  catch, whether the gear broke, and fluctuating fish prices. Maybe two or two and  a half months out at sea, all together. We started filming with our own cameras, quite heavy and shoulder-mounted,  but one was stolen in New Bedford and the others were lost to the waves. So  we resorted to progressively smaller DSLRs and tiny cameras which we both  handheld ourselves and attached to the fishermen’s bodies: their heads, chests,  and wrists. From the second trip on, we also attached a couple to the end of two  2" × 2" poles that were fastened together, giving us about a 16-inch reach, so we  could film underwater and from above the sea and the boat. It wasn’t until the last trip that our curiosity and sense of wonder about what  we were witnessing began to wane, that we felt that our accumulated footage had  begun to do justice to everything we’d experienced on the boat. SM: What were the struggles during the editing process? LC-T/VP: Editing was weirdly easy and intuitive. Our main struggle was where to  situate humanity in the cosmos we were constructing. For all of the inherent  anthropomorphism of cinema, we had a kind of post-humanist ambition to rela- tivize the human in a larger physical and metaphysical domain of both interspecies  bestiality and of animate-inanimate promiscuity, one in which humans, fish,  birds, machines, and the elements would have a kind of restless ontological parity.  327 </page> <page sequence="69"> Scott MacDonald We felt this, instinctively, in most of our images, but we did struggle with how  to structure them, whether to begin in the familiar domain of the recognizably  human and end somewhere much more inchoate and abstract, or to begin in the  realm of undomesticable nature and proceed progressively towards the human.  In the final edit of the film, there is perhaps a gradual, if far from seamless, trajec- tory that leads towards the human-as-we-know-it, culminating in the shot of the  fisherman in the galley falling asleep in front of Th e Deadliest Catch on satellite  television, but this is subsequently blown asunder in the apocalyptic ending, the  encounter with the leviathan rolling below the boat and the sublime in the sky. SM: Like so many of the Sensory Ethnography films, Leviathan is as much a sound  work as an image work. I assume this was partly inevitable, given the realities of  ocean fishing. Lucien, when you shot Sweetgrass, you and Ernst Karel developed complex  ways of doing sync sound; what were the various sound technologies that made  Leviathan possible? LC-T/VP: Initially, both in New Bedford and out in the Atlantic, we were shooting  with a Sony EX3 and an EX1, each with a stereo Sanken microphone mounted on  it. We were also recording wild sound onto a Sound Devices T788 recorder, both  from a super stereo microphone (another Sanken model) and various Lectrosonics  wireless lavaliers. Th ough we lost these cameras, and ended up discarding all the  images except one that we’d shot with them, both on land and at sea, we kept  the sound—as well as all the wild sound we recorded on the Sound Devices:  the nets, the winches, the cutting tables, the scallop shucking basins, inside  the bridge, etcetera. Th en we started recording on DSLRs, with smaller stereo  mics mounted on them, and with the tiny automated cameras with their inbuilt  mono-microphones, which were no great shakes, and even more compromised  when enclosed in a waterproof housing. SM: You also went for surround sound and worked both with Karel and, later on,  Jacob Ribicoff . Could you talk about the decision to put the sound-design through  a two-step process? What exactly did Ribicoff  add? LC-T/VP: Th e sensorial intensity of life on the boat is as acoustic as it is visual—the  engine is relentless and renders dialogue all but unintelligible—and it never  occurred to us not to aff ord equal billing to sound and picture. VP: Except at one point early in the editing when Lucien had the ridiculous notion  to make the whole film silent! 328 </page> <page sequence="70"> Interviews LC-T/VP: In many ways, sound is also less coded and reducible to putative meaning  than picture, more evocative, imaginative, and abstract. As choreographed as the  film is, we are both drawn to the uncoded and the uncontrolled. But while we are  both obsessed with and highly opinionated about sound, we are also more or less  tone deaf. And we have, as you say, collaborated with our friend and colleague  Ernst Karel in all of our work. Ernst is first and foremost a remarkably subtle musician, phonographer,  sound artist, and audio engineer. His ears are the most delicate and discerning  we know. While we were editing the film, the soundtrack was unremitting, oft en  over-modulating, an overbearing monotony somewhere between punk rock,  grunge, and heavy metal. We were interested in continuing something of this  aesthetic over into the final mix, but we also knew it would have to be rendered  much more variegated and multidimensional. Ernst came up with a wonderful  5.1 mix that had subtleties and modulations we could barely imagine, and Jacob  then reworked this into something more cinematic. SM: Th e color palette of the film is impressive, partly I think because we see the  bright colors of yellow slickers, red blood, etcetera, mostly against black—much  of what we see was filmed at night. Were you filming day and night, or mostly at  night? Did the footage shot at night just look more interesting? LC-T/VP: Day and night, and yes, the footage at night seemed more evocative of  our experience at sea, and our sense of wonder before what we were witnessing. At  night you lose all your bearings, and if the sea is rough and you’re out on deck, half  the time you don’t know up from down, or sea from sky. And of course sea and sky  are both pitch black, unless the moon is up, and the only source of illumination  comes from the ferocious lights illuminating the deck where the hauling back and  gutting of the fish continues around the clock. So there’s a huge latitude between  the brightest and darkest parts of the frame, and the oranges and greens and reds  of the slickers, the nets, and the blood are fluorescent, even psychedelic at times. Th e owl of Minerva takes flight at twilight, and art and cinema do too.  Nonfiction films, to their own impoverishment, tend not to, being beholden to  the dazzling discursive clarity of daylight. SM: Faye Ginsberg, who saw the film at the New York Film Festival, complained to  me that the fishermen were stereotypes. How did you think about the depiction  of the workers in Leviathan? LC-T/VP: You could argue that they’re not even stereotypes, they’re barely mono- types! But in the sense that “stereotype” means a culturally conditioned and  329 </page> <page sequence="71"> Scott MacDonald conditioning cliché that does a disservice to its object’s nuance or complexity, the  fishermen don’t seem to be represented stereotypically in this sense either. To be  sure, we don’t round them out as characters, or through narrative emplotment,  in recognizably dramatic and human ways. We shied away from this for the same  reason that we shied away from shore and that we shied away from light. Th e way in which the toiling bodies are portrayed in the film as part of the  scenarios of life and death playing out on the boat seems to us quite faithful to  the realities we witnessed. But we never had the slightest interest in depicting the  fishermen as “workers” as such, in any way that would dissociate their labors from  their being and their niche in the larger psychophysical naturecultural ecological  fold that we momentarily inhabited. We don’t share the humanistic concerns of the documentary tradition. Marx  fetishized work no less than capitalists do, as the be-all and end-all of life.
