<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amimal magnetism by Ellen Cantarow Particularly Cats...and Rufus, by Doris Lessing, illustrated by James McMullan. New York: Knopf, 1991, 129 pp., $20.00 hardcover. IN 1979 IT BECAME CLEAR that the cat of my youth, Cocoa, a small dark-brown Bur- mese who had been with me through graduate school, through the years of my courtship with my later-to-be husband, and then through the first ten years of our mar- riage, was ready to die. We weren't inconsol- able-after all she was "only a cat"-but we certainly grieved. We loved her. Hadn't we paid hundreds of dollars to have her dialysed when her kidneys failed? And hadn't we kept her alive through her old age on a low-protein diet of Campbell's Chicken Noodleoo soup? But now the end seemed really to have arrived. She was all but blind; a middle-ear affliction drove her to pace around and around in maddening, senile circles. Then came the time when the circling stopped. She was too arthritic even to struggle painfully up on our bed to sleep with us. Seeing she no longer had even this small pleasure-and with many brave protestations to the effect that, after all, we would want the same thing done for us-I took her to our vet to have her killed. Too much a coward to stay with her while she died, I cried in front of the vet and then apologized: "1 know she's only a cat..." And the vet, winning my abiding gratitude and my resolution never again to apologize for the place animals have held in my life, gently corrected me: "No. She isn't only a cat." Particularly Cats...and Rufus, a mar- velous little book about the cats in Doris Lessing's life (reprinted from its 1967 original with a new concluding section, "Rufus, the Survivor"), reminded me of Cocoa particularly, and of all the cats who have gladdened and comforted my life. It is guaranteed to do the same for all cat-loving readers. None of the animals in it is "only a cat." From the ones that live on Lessing's family's farm in Rhodesia in the twenties and thirties through Rufus, a battered orange tom "whose confidence in someone...had once been so badly betrayed that he could not allow himself ever to love again," the animals that play and feud and give birth here all have their personal sagas. There is Lessing's first childhood pet who comes to her when she is ill: The cat, a bluish-grey Persian, arrived purring on my bed, and settled down to share my sickness, my food, my pil- low, my sleep. When I woke in the mornings, my face tumed to half- frozen linen; the outside of the fur blanket on the bed was cold; the smell of fresh whitewash from next door was cold and antiseptic; the wind lifting and laying the dust outside the door was cold-but in the crook of my arm, a light purring warmth, the cat, my friend..(p.15) But the Persian dies of pneumonia: For a week she lay in my anns purring, purring, in a rough trembling hoarse little voice that became weaker, then was silent; licked my hand; opened enor- mous green eyes when I called her name and besought her to live; closed them, died, and was thirown into La dried-up well]...half filled with nubbish, tin cans and corpses. That was it. Never again. And for years 1 matched cats in friends' houses, cats in shops, cats on farms, cats on the street...with that gentle blue-grey purring creature which for me was the cat, the Cat, never to be replaced. (p. 16) After a 25-year lapse, Lessing begins ac- quiring other cats. "Grey cat" is a gorgeous part-Siamese given to her in kittenhood by friends-an "enchanting, a delicate fairy-tale cat, whose Siamese genes showed in the shape of the face, ears, tail, and the subtle lines of its body..." Hugely vain, a finicky eater, she is a bad mother, amazed and in- furiated by matermity: presented with her first offspring, She looked, looked at me, moved a little, to see if she could lose the attached ob- ject-then...cleaned the kitten, did every- thing expected of her, purred-and then she got up and walked downstairs, where she sat on the back verandah, looking at the garden. That was over, she seemed to be thinking. Then her sides contracted again, and she tumed around to look at me-she was annoyed, furious. Her face, the lines of her body said, unmistakably, What a damned nuisance! (p.38) Lessing acquires black cat by hap- penstance during grey cat's tenancy. Black cat is an unflirtatious, "steady, obstinate, modest little beast" with "a curved noble profile, like a cat on a tomb." The story of grey cat's and black cat's rivalry for Lessing's attention occupies much of the book. There are incidental cats throughout Par- ticularly Cats, and memorable incidental people: my favorite, a Parisian woman Less- ing once knew who adopted a bird that flew one day into her apartment. Winter came, the bird had grown tame, she was about to go on vacation. But now she had a new respon- sibility: she took the bird with her in a cage. In the hotel, she told Lessing, Old ladies stopped me on the stairs. Girls told me about their love problems. I went right back to Paris and sulked until the spring came. Then I threw that bird out of the window with a curse, and ever since then I've kept the windows shut. I simply will not be liked and that's that! (pp.69-70) R _ EADING THIS SERIES of interconnected stories I was reminded how truly rare good "animal writing" is. It is so easy to apologize for one's feelings for pets (the after-all-they're-only-animals reflex), so easy to descend into anthropomorphism (a form of apology: to ascribe human sentiment and motive to animals is to declare them not "serious enough" for literary treatment). And so easy to fall into that other vulgarity, sen- timentality. For me, the very best animal portrayers are writers like Colette, or Elsa Morante, in whose momentous epic of Fascist Italy, His- tory: A Novel, animals are central pro- tagonists (one of its heroines is a white sheepdog named Bella who will live in my memory as one of the great character por- trayals in twentieth-century realism). These writers are unafraid of treating beasts with high seriousness. By this 1 don't mean pom- pousness but something that in unskilled hands can tip over into pompousness or plain silliness. 1 mean the conviction that there is something sacred (Morante's term) in nature, that as part of nature our "pets" are not lesser than we, and that the writer has a respon- sibility for seeing into their inner lives just as she must with people. Above all, pets are individuals. Each has its own complex history consisting of your own relationship with it and its with you. And like all relationships, people's with their animals are slow to build. This is the stuff of memory, which is to say, the stuff of good storytelling. And the greatest writers about animals are g ood story tel lers . Lessing is in that tradition; each of her cats has its story, and each story unfolds fine- ly, in connection with all the others. Grey cat, for example, loses her ascendancy when black cat gets sick. Black cat has a raging fever, severe dehydration: enteritis. Her fur was already like a dead cat's, with dust and fluif in it; her R O O M Books for Women and Their Friends 681 Washington Street New York, NY 10014 (212) 727-7330 December Events Thurs. 5th 7 pm Drucilla Cornell, Beyond Accommodation: Ethical Femi- nism, Deconstruction and the Law Sun. 8th 3 pm Amber Coverdale Sum- rall, Rosetta Reitz, &amp; other con- tributors, Women of the l4th Moon: Writ- ings on Menopause Thurs. l2th 7 pm Flora Davis, Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America Since 1960 Wheelchair accessible.

I tried to rub some life into her cold body. I did this for some time, about half an hour. (p.57) Black cat survives. And then: Rufus. He appears one day, an "old derelict" with ears "tomn, scarred with fighting," arthritic, with teeth missing, bad kidneys and a host of other problems. Rufus isn't really old; he's just had a very hard life. Lessing concludes from small signs and episodes that Rufus is a former house pet abandoned by his owners. She already has two neutered toms: only after long resistance to the animal, who waits patiently day after day, does she take Rufus in. He is made to stay in the kitchen, where for a long time he sequesters himself fearfully on a single chair with "the air of one who knows he must make the most of what Fate offers before it is withdrawn." Then: One day, when the arbiters of his fate were in the kitchen drinking tea, he hopped off his chair and walked slow- ly to the door into the rest of the house. There he stopped and tumed and most deliberately looked at us. He could not have asked more clearly: Can I go further into the house? Can I be a proper house cat?... We pointed to his chair and he climbed patiently back on to it, where he lay silent and disappointed for a while, and then set his sides heaving in a purr. Needless to say, this made us feel terrible. (p. 114) I leave readers to discover the denouement themselves. T LHE TENDERNESS IN Particularly Cats is arresting precisely because Lessing is so unsentimental. At times her inter- mittent musings on the evolutionary origins of feline behavior, which sceptics could view as a sort of sentimentality, gave me pause. Take, for example, her speculations about an incident in the long rivalry between grey cat and black cat. Grey cat kills mice and brings them to Lessing to gain favor; grey cat never eats them, black cat does-and then, only after Lessing has seen them and given signs of approval to grey cat. At one point, Lessing writes, I had gone shopping...I came back and saw, in the middle of the floor, a little caim or mound of greenery. Grey cat sat near to it, watching me. Black cat was waiting with her kittens in the armchair... I went to look. Under the green stuff, a dead mouse. Grey cat had caught the mouse...[b]ut I had been longer coming back than she expected; and so she had had time for decora- tion-or perhaps it was a wamning to black cat: leave the mouse alone. (p.88) The whole story could strain your belief (un- less, of course, you've owned many cats) as could Lessing's reflection: I've been told since that lions some- times drag branches over a fresh kill. To mark it? To protect it from jackals and hyenas?... Had grey cat remembered, through thousands of years, her kinship with the lion? (p.89) What bothers me mildly in this passage is the "'remembered," but never mind: it's a small quibble. Lessing lovers will discover that she ex- hibits her best style here-deliberately lean, nearly adjectiveless, innocent of any but the most essential polysyllables, a series of seemingly flat declarative sentences that are only "simple" if you've never tried to ex- ecute them yourself. It makes for narrative that strikes to the bone: A snake in the woodpile raised an alarm; and I caused the death of a favourite cat by saying I had seen the snake creeping in between two logs. What I had seen was. the cat's tail. My mother shot at something greyish that moved; and out shrieked the cat, its side blown out, all red and raw. It thrashed and yelled among the wood chips, its small bleeding heart showing between fragile broken ribs. It died, while my mother wept and petted it. Meanwhile the cobra was looped around a high log a couple of yards away. (p.8) Particularly Cats begs to be read aloud. I myself have read it to adults, but I think it would go over well with children. And James McMullan's beautiful watercolors are just what children-and this grownup-look for in such a book. Absolutely faithful to the text (no jarringly sophisticated abstractions here!), they show Doris Lessing with her cats-the bluish-grey Persian cuddled by the sick child; grey cat with her tabby markings and elongated Siamese head hissing at black cat from her top-cat position on Lessing's bed; Rufus on his chair in Lessing's kitchen. The paintings have the exquisite detail I remember from my favorite childhood books: the vividly colored vegetables in the blue- and-white salad bowl on the kitchen table in front of Rufus' chair; the glass-bottomed lamp resting next to the bowl on the brown table behind the sick child's bed; the pattems in the oriental-style rugs in Lessing's country house, where grey cat and black cat lie before the fire. Give this book at Christmas, or on birthdays, or any time, just out of affection, to the people you love who love cats. 4 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AT COLLEGE PARK COLLEGE OF ARTS AND HUMANITIES The College of Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland at College Park invites applications and nomina- tions for the following positions to begin July 1, 1992. * CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF HEBREW AND EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES.
