<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS OLD TESTAMENT AND RELATED TOPICS American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures , 58, 1941. W. A. Irwin, "Samuel and the Rise of the Monarchy" (113-34). Only Lods and Eissfeldt and Gressman "have recognized the innocent hoax perpetrated on all subsequent historiography" by the author of 1 Kgs. 9:1-10:16. More general conclusions are that Samuel may have anointed neither David nor Saul, and that of Samuel himself we know next to nothing. Only an Israelite without "theological preoccupa- tions" could write a satisfactory account of the monarchy's begin- nings for Irwin ; that is to say, no ancient writer could have done it. W. E. Staples, "The Reading of Hebrew" (139-45). Suggests that some generic nouns in the Old Testament text, preceding proper or more specific names, are on a par with the determinative ideograms of Egyptian and Babylonian writing. Asia, 40, 1940. N. Glueck, "Ezion-Geber : Singapore of Solomon" (663-69). The article gives a brief, clear description of a city that was Solomon's factory town, fortress, and port on the north shore of the gulf of Aqaba. The contents have already appeared in the author's book, The Other Side of the Jordan (New Haven, 1940), and in articles in BASOR (Bulletins 71, 72, 75, 79). The identification of Tell el-Kheleifeh with Ezion-Geber is challenged by Bea in Biblica, cf. below. Biblica, 21, 1940. I. Zolli, "In margine al Cantico dei Cantici" (273-82). In Cant. 2:4, Zolli understands degel in the light of As- syrian diglu and dagālu; he derives the sense, "His gaze upon me was love." In Cant. 7:6, he reads the extant text to mean, "The upper part of thy coiffure is like Carmel; and thy hair that hangs down is like royal purple bound around beams (i.e., on the loom)." G. E. Closen, S.J., "Gedanken zur Textkritik von Ps. 2:llb-12a" (288-309). Compare the related article of R. Köbert, S.J., "Zur ur- sprünglichen Textform von Ps. 2:ll-12a" (ibid., 426-28). Closen reviews from 1903 to date the history of the conjectural reading, nasseqü lereglã(y)w birlada (h), which with various modifications has been accepted by many scholars. He discusses the appropriateness of the reading as regards its grammar, its cultural background and the anthropomorphic imagery it supposes. Accepting the conjecture, he accounts for the present reading as a paleographical accident. Köbert would read rather wereglā(y) w bire'ãdã(h) nasseqü; his ex- planation for the present reading is ingenious, but requires a succes- sion of at least three separate mistakes in transmission. A. Metzinger, "Die Substitutionstheorie und das alttestamentliche Opfer mit besonderer Berücksichtigung von Lev. 17:11 (159-87; 247-</page><page sequence="2">Survey of Periodicals 269 72; 353-77). This series of three articles is a detailed, thorough study of the substitution theory in O. T. bloody sacrifices. The inquiry is divided into two parts. In the first the author studies the meaning of the term, gives the history of the theory, and presents the arguments for and against it. In the second, he explains in detail the locus clas - sicus, Lev. 17:11b, points out its bearing on the theory, and adds a history of the interpretation of the verse. The substitution theory about which the author is concerned may be summarized thus: man has forfeited his life by sin and deserves death; God in his mercy is satisfied to accept the life of an animal in place of man's ; guilty man symbolizes the transfer of his sins and of the death penalty by im- posing hands on the animal. Thus, in bloody sacrifices the notion of death is in the foreground. The author remarks that the sacrifice of Christ has played a part in giving form to this conception. He then considers the question whether the substitution of the sacrificial animal is to be conceived as a substitution of the death penalty which man must pay. On turning to Lev. 17:11b, he finds two questions claiming attention: the blood -nephesh relationship, and the phrase -isa* vsn, The conclusion arrived at is that expiation is effected by the blood itself ; blood, by God's grant, was made the medium of expia- tion because it was conceived to be the seat of life. The bibliography during the course of the articles is very rich. H. Bückers, "Das 'Ewige Leben' in 2 Makk. 7:36" (406-12). The author argues that it is preferable to join the words àeváov ftrnję with what precedes them. This reading, he argues, is confirmed by the book's doctrine of the resurrection, that only with the resurrection will the faithful enjoy "eternal life." A. Bea, S. J., "Archäologische Beiträge zur israelitisch-jüdischen Geschichte" (429-45). A summary of excavation work carried out on two sites - Ain-Shems (the biblical Beth Shemesh) and Tell el-Khe- leifeh. Biblica, 22, 1941. A. Vaccari, S.J., "Frammenti biblici latini dall' Egitto in parte palinsesti" (1-12). Exod. 8:16-20; 8:28-9:1 in uncial characters of about the fifth century. The writing is on both sides of a torn parchment, representing the inside columns, from recto and verso of a leaf ; it comes from a codex in which the text was written two columns to the page. Across the verso is super-imposed a business letter in Arabic, ascribed by Vaccari to the eighth century. The Latin text is not the Vulgate, but an Old Latin rendering akin to that of Exodus in the Lyons codex. P. Joüon, S.J., "Cinq imparfaits remarquables dans l'Araméen de Daniel" (21-24). Cases of the use of the imperfect tense, following on perfects, to express not continuity or frequency of action, but</page><page sequence="3">270 Survey of Periodicals simple subordination. Ibid., "Le mot dans Esdras 5:3(9)" (38-40). Parallels from Elephantine suggest that wooden material is meant. Joüon would read the word 'isrānā or ' nsrānā , from a root meaning "to saw." It would be a collective noun for "planks," or "panels." C. Peters, "Zur Herkunft der Peshitta des ersten Samuel-Buches" (25-34). As previously for the Pentateuch, Peters affirms that for 1 Samuel, the Peshitta stands in close relationship with the Jewish Targum; it represents in fact an earlier state of the Targumic ma- terial before the working over which has made the extant Targum closer to the letter of M.T. The Peshitta itself, in the course of its separate history, has also been retouched in the light of the Hebrew. A. Bea, S.J., "Neuere Arbeiten zum Problem der biblischen Chro- nikbücher" (46-58). Starting from Wellhausen's estimate that the books of Paralipomenon represent a priestly preoccupation and con- tain no independent historical data as compared with Samuel and Kings, Bea outlines the recent literature which subverts that position wholly. The studies of Rothstein-Hänel, v. Rad, B. Luther, Noordtzij and Welch are cited; and after a summary reference to the older Catholic literature, ample space is devoted to the recent and reliable work of Göttsberger. Biblical Archaeologist , 3, 1940 (No. 4) ; 4, 1941 (No. 1). Further statements, popular in character, of the results of excavating at Me- giddo and at Tell el-Kheleifeh ; by R. M. Engberg and N. Glueck, re- spectively. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, 80, 1940. N. Glueck, "Ostraca from Elath" (3-10; continued, 82, 1941, 3-11); also shorter notices by Albright and Torrey (82, 1941, 11-15). The writing is Aramaic, the period sixth to fourth centuries B.c., and the interpretation of course difficult. I. Mendelsohn, "Guilds in Ancient Palestine" (80, 1940, 17-21). The evidence of the Bible, the Talmud and archaeology alike suggest the existence of guilds of craftsmen in the Holy Land before the Hel- lenistic period. W. F. Albright, "New Egyptian Data on Palestine in the Patriar- chal Age" (81, 1941, 16-21). The data are an extension, based on material now in Brussels, of the collection of geographical and per- sonal names from Palestine-Syria c. 2000 B.c. preserved in transcrip- tion in Egyptian execratory formulae. This latest group of objects with such formulae are figurines portraying bound captives, meant for magical use against disloyal Asiatic vassals. H. L. Ginsberg, "Lachish Ostraca New and Old" (80, 1940, 10-13) ; also W. F. Albright, "The Lachish Ostraca after Five Years" (82, 1941, 18-24). Three new fragments have been published during the</page><page sequence="4">Survey of Periodicals 271 past year by Torczyner ; they are discussed, with a review of the older material in the light of recent study. Civiltà Cattolica , Anno 92, 1941, I. F. S. Porporato, S.J., "Miti e ispirazione biblica" (169-79; to be continued). Touches on terms from Roman mythology borrowed by St. Jerome to render otherwise untranslatable Hebrew words. Ecclesiastical Review , 104, 1941, F. X. Peirce, S. J., "Recent Bible Study." Discusses studies in recent periodical literature on the mes- sianic passages in Isaias 7 and 9. Expository Times , 52, 1940-41. J. W. Jack, "Recent Biblical Arch- aeology" (112-15; 229-33). The general topics discussed are windows, doors, locks, dress and apparel. Reviews of recent work cover Beth- Shemesh, Megiddo, Trans jordan, and the present North Wall of Jeru- salem. Literary points involve Joakin, king of Juda (a cuneiform text attesting his captivity has been published by Weidner), and Cushan- Rishathaim, whom Jack too confidently equates with Artatama II, a Hurrian ruler of c. 1370 B.c. T. H. Robinson, "Note on Psalm 34:21" (117). The Polel form from niD does not mean merely "put to death" as does the Hiphil ; from the usage in other places, it is seen to imply a coup de grâce to the already injured. J. Lindblom, "The Character of the Prophetic Literature" (126-31). A comparison with private revelations in Christian times; Lindblom also emphasizes the revealed character of the separate messages and the compilatory nature of the books. Homiletic and Pastoral Review , 40, 1940. J. Steinmueller, "Primi- tive Hebrew Religion," (1077-1086; 1179-1191; 1300-1313). In these articles Dr. Steinmueller describes the monotheistic religion, the morality, and the culture of the Patriarchs. A good summary of the biblical data. Journal of Biblical Literature , 59, 1940. Harry M. Orlinsky, "On the Commonly Proposed Lëk Wena'abõr of I Kings 18:5" (515-17). Instead of the above, the author proposes Lekā wena'berã(h). The former word, he claims, is the only form used as an interjection, and after an imperative or an interjection the verb in the first person is expressed by the cohortative. The same author has begun a more general study on the sequence of jussives and cohortatives to the imperative or interjection in Jewish Quarterly Review 31 (1940-41), 371-82. Millar Burrows, "The Marriage of Boaz and Ruth" (445-454). Con- tinuing his work on Hebrew levirate marriage,1 Burrows turns to 1 "The Ancient Oriental Background of Hebrew Levirate Marriage," BASOR, no. 77, 2-15, and "Levirate Marriage in Israel," JBL , 59 (1940), 23-33.</page><page sequence="5">272 Survey op Periodicals the problems raised in that connection by the Book of Ruth. He finds that the whole story of the marriage of Boaz and Ruth and of the transactions connected with the marriage does not fit in the picture of Israelite law and custom presented by the rest of the O.T., par- ticularly the laws of the Pentateuch. Part of the trouble, he says, lies in the fact that we have in Ruth a combination of three institutions which are not elsewhere found together - levirate marriage, redemp- tion, and inheritance. Although allowing that alternative explanations may contain some truth, Burrows holds as most probable that the peculiar features of the story of Ruth represent a transitional stage between redemption-marriage as an affair of the clan, in which case the interest of the clan was satisfied if the go* el begot a son in his own name, and levirate marriage as an affair of the immediate family, in which case it was deemed necessary to continue the name of the widow's previous husband. The explanation would be acceptable, if it were a known fact that such a development actually took place in Israel. It is rather venturesome to suppose such a development on the strength of this one instance that can be explained otherwise. Julius Lewy, "The Shulman Temple in Jerusalem" (519-22). Lewy submits a passage from an el-Amarna letter, which "if read in the light of an Assyrian explanatory list of divine names furnishes direct evidence to the effect that Jerusalem was the seat of the god Shulman." G. E. Wright, "Archaeological Observations on the Period of the Judges and the Early Monarchy" (ibid., 60, 1941, 27-42). Describes the evidence for a growth in material culture among the Israelites from a quite low level in the period of the Judges, by contrast with their Canaanite neighbors, to full equality and an economic domi- nance over Philistia by the time of Solomon. R. Wischnitzer-Bernstein, "The Conception of the Resurrection in the Ezekiel Panel of the Dura Synagogue" (43-55). The lost tribes are seen represented, along with Judah, Benjamin, and Levi; one figure is identified as a Davidic Messiah. Cpr. the related discussion by Kraeling in BASOR, No. 78. Journal of the American Oriental Society , 61, 1941. O. Neugebauer, "The Chronology of the Hammurabi Age" (58-61). An authoritative caution against offhand conclusions on the chronology of Western Asia from data given by astronomy. The tendency to date Ham- murabi just after 1800 is endorsed on historical and archaeological grounds, but the author excludes any definitive value to the astrono- mical clues. New Scholasticism , 15, 1941. F. V. Courneen, S.J., "Philo Judaeus Had the Concept of Creation" (46-58). "I am attributing to him the common doctrine of the Jews as expressed throughout the Old Testa- ment " The citations from Philo seem to prove the point, but the</page><page sequence="6">Survey of Periodicals 273 Old Testament authority for a doctrine of creation is given an empha- sis disproportionate to its extent and its traceable influence on Philo. Orientalistische Literaturzeitung , 43, 1940. O. Eissfeldt, "Neues und Altes zur Paradieserzählung" (coll. 401-09). The article is really a review of Paul Humbert's Etudes sur le Récit du Paradis et de la Chute dans la Genèse (Neuchatel, 1940). Eissfeldt agrees that "know- ledge of good and evil" is the practical knowledge of adults and not merely moral consciousness or consciousness of sex or pure reason. "Image of God" signifies the bodily form of man, made after the man- ner of godlike creatures surrounding God and also of God himself. This quality is inalienable and not lost by the fall. Humbert renders Gen. 2:17 "you will certainly die," whereas Eissfeldt holds for "you will die at once." In his literary analysis Humbert finds in the peri- cope one chief account with a secondary auxiliary source; Eissfeldt argues that there are two parallel accounts in the section. Palestine Exploration Quarterly , 1940. D. Winston Thomas, "The Ancient Site of Lachish" (148-9). The note aims "only to contest Torczyner's claim that lines 9b-13 of Ostrakon IV 'give positive proof that Tell ed-Duweir .... really is the site of ancient Lachish.' " Theological Studies 2, 1941. M. J. Gruenthaner, S.J., "The Messi- anic Concepts of Ezekiel" (1-18). Chapters 33-48 of Ezekiel are effec- tively analyzed with respect to their fulfilment in Christ and in the Church. The prophecy regarding the apportionment of the land among the Israelites is to be taken as intended for literal fulfilment. Its non-fulfilment is to be explained not by an inherent mystical meaning rendering it inapplicable but by the failure of the Israelites them- selves to fulfil the conditions laid down. Theologische Literaturzeitung , 65, 1940. M. Johannessohn, "Die Göttinger Septuaginta" (coli. 289-296). A noteworthy appraisal of J. Ziegler's edition of LXX Isaias and of a shorter work by Ziegler on the Hexaplaric fragments from the later versions of the same book. Among book reviews the following may be of some interest. J. Coppens' VHistoire critique de l'Ancien Testament (Tournai-Paris, 1938) has been enthusiastically reviewed by Fleming James in JBL, 59 (1940), 523-4, and by G. B. Closen in Biblica , 21 (1940), 330-3. Not so enthusiastic were the reviews by W. F. Albright of Fr. Fer- nandez' two latest works: Problemas di topografía palestinense (Bar- celona, 1936, issued in 1939) and Commentarius in Librum Josue ( Cursus Scripturae Sacrae , Sectio II, Vol. 5. Paris, 1938) in JBL, 59 (1940), 538-46. Albright finds Fernández' works, despite their many merits, reflecting a now antiquated stage of research. Patrick W. Skehan John P.
