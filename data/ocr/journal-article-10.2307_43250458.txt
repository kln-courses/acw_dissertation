<plain_text><page sequence="1">Schelling and Onto-theology I. Leask The Schelling revival1 has never quite reconciled itself to the Swabian's religious anima. Schelling's Hegel-critique may now be recognized as something like a proto-deconstruction of Idealism's 'paroxysmal' self- assertion; but, we are told, this 'anti-logocentric' kernel has usually to be extricated from a mystical-theosophical shell. Likewise, there may be vast, fruitful depths to Schelling's stricture that Being is irreducible to thought; nonetheless, Schelling's "apparently dead theology"2 is best either forgotten or else 'translated' into the lexicon of Lacanian psycho- analysis, Derridean deconstruction, Rortyian postmodern pragmatism, etc. The religious concerns of Schelling's later work are, it seems, little more than an embarrassment for those driving the revival. Despite profound gratitude towards those (principally Bowie) who have done so much to instigate the current Schelling renaissance, I want to suggest here that we should not be so quick to brush aside, or 'translate', Schelling's theologico-religious interests - for such a dismissal leaves us not just decontextualizing Schelling's Hegel-critique, but, as well, missing out on a crucial Schellingian contribution to contemporary debate about the question of onto-theology. Schelling's continuing relevance is more than his blowing open the Hegelian Identity of Thought and Being; it is also his concomitant reinstatement - not merely incidental to but fundamental for his critique of Idealism's auto-apotheosis - of the ancient Platonic conviction that the divinity 'is' epekeina tes ousias , beyond Being or any metaphysical construction. i Onto-theology and Apophaticism First, what is meant by 'onto-theology'? For Heidegger, as we know, the term refers to attempts to render 'God' a univocal concept both contained within and grounding metaphysical speculation: onto-theology treats 'God' as the efficient and knowable foundation, both Begründung and Ergriindung , the means by which thinking lays claim to the All, the whole. Onto-theology assumes Being as manifest (to beings) via thought; it assumes Being's 'self-grounding' as accessible (to beings) via logos. Thinking, in accounting for itself, is 'thus' a systematic account of the ultimate Ratio ; philosophy qua onto-theology is the Science of God - which, for Heidegger, means that onto-theology fails to think the 273</page><page sequence="2">ontological difference between Being and beings and, correspondingly, presumes to assimilate into thought our divine 'ground'. In rationalizing the Deity, in making God a containable metaphysical concept, philosophy thereby ensures that "[the] Being of beings is represented fundamentally, in the sense of the ground, only as causa suť? My argument here is certainly not directed against the application of this Heideggerian critique to that Hegelian gigantism which absolutizes and apotheosizes wilful Self-Certainty. However, contra Heidegger, I do not accept that "from beginning to end" philosophy has treated the question of the theos as "conceived 'logically' - logically in the sense of speculative thinking".4 For, with this Procrustean (even totalizing) assertion, Heidegger seems to ignore the pre-modern stress on an apophatic 'other' of onto-theology, the Platonic awareness of a divinity transcending all metaphysical speculation, all Ratio. This, in itself, seems a considerable oversight. But, what is more, Heidegger also misses a distinctly modern manifestation of this same apophaticism - in Schelling's later writings - and this mistakes Schellingian thought for a culminating element within modern onto-theology. Given that it is Schelling's thought which most concerns us here, my treatment of pre-modern apophaticism is restricted to the following necessarily adumbrated observation: that, whether in classical or Christian formation,5 Platonic apophaticism is always underpinned by what we might term a 'principle of constitutive incompletion'.6 Classical apophaticism, that is, consistently aims at an overcoming of both ontology and theology: from Plato's Good beyond Being to Damasicus's One beyond negation - between which points we also find: the One beyond both Being and the Good (Speusippus and Xenocrates); ineffable Nous (Albinus); the neo-Pythagorean 'Father' (Numenius); the 'Supreme Father' ( Chaldean Oracles ); the unknowable God and non-being Being (the Gnostic Apocrypha of John and Allogenes ); and, of course, the ineffable One (Plotinus) - there is a consistent undermining of any attempt at rendering rationally transparent the Divine-Beyond. Similarly Christian apophaticism: whether we consider Clement and Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, the Pseudo-Dionysius or John Scotus Eriugena, we should treat with great scepticism any suggestion that, for the early Christians, 'God' is somehow contained within our thought and speech. Instead, the Deity is always deemed beyond correlational, discursive reasoning, inaccessible to any systematizing or Science. Ancient apophaticism - in and for which Being is never absolutized - is neither implicit nor explicit onto-theology; rather, as Reiner Schürmann has shown, it is more like an overcoming of metaphysics.6 Before we consider Schelling's historicized re- instatement of this pre- 274</page><page sequence="3">modem 'negative' spirituality apophaticism, however, we should first remind ourselves of the more celebrated aspects of later Schellingian thought. ii Schelling contra Hegel The mature Schelling deflates the Idealist empowerment of subjectivity and 'concealment' of Being; where Hegel presents the Absolute triumph of unconditioned Self-Certainty, Schelling insists that no philosophical system can contain its own basis, its Urgrund. Schelling emphasizes - contra Hegel - the ontological difference between Thought and Being: the quod , Schelling tells us, is in no sense the attribute or predicate of the quid. Hegel had maintained that everything must be viewed as mediated:7 just as there can be no Identity without Difference,8 so even the category of immediacy ( Unmittelbarkeit ) can only be defined in relation to the mediated. Although Being, in its immediacy, appears as independent, massif, 'simply there', this immediacy is itself, according to Hegelian logic, the product of thought: the apparent immediacy is, for Hegel, only apparent and 'actually' mediated (in the Concept, which represents the 'truth' of Being). Thus, Being depends on thought; it is not, after all, independent. Where Being may seem 'simply there', and where Thought {qua Essence) may seem to rely on existence, Being itself turns out to rely on Thought. The 'truth' of the initial and apparent immediacy is, for Hegel, the mediating work of the Concept. That is, the immediacy of Being is only achieved (or, rather, perceived) through reflection, and is thus not 'pure' or independent immediacy: it is the 'product', so to speak, of Essence. Thought (or Essence), meanwhile, cannot be of its own accord: it 'relies' on Being. Each is thus a necessary reciprocal other - Thought is the necessary other of Being, Being the necessary other of Thought. Hegel has achieved, it seems, the identity of the apparently disparate (Being and Essence). What is problematic here - as Henrich9 and Frank10 have brought out (by following Schellingian lines) - is not Hegel's suggestion that in order to know Being there must be thought, but his presupposition of symmetrical structure: from a Schellingian point of view, immediate Being is, before any reflection, and thus the 'merger' of the two is not a merger at all. Being may depend on Thought, in order to be known; and Thought may depend on Being, in order to be , to exist. But the 'dependency' in each case is quite different: while Essence is the epistemological ground of Being, Being, by contrast, is the ontological ground of Essence." To depend on Essence in order to be known is not tantamount to depending on Essence in order to exist. As Schelling 275</page><page sequence="4">observes, "[t]he nature of mere being is just to be, independent of every idea".12 This conflation, or confusion, of Thought and Being, Schelling suggests, points us towards a fundamental failing of post-Cartesian thought: its subjectification of Being. A century before Heidegger's similar verdict, therefore, Schelling shows us the keynote {der Grundton) of modern philosophy, the fundamental concern which links Descartes to Hegel: "Like a spell", Schelling realizes, "philosophy was caught in the realm of the subjective... the solely subjective consciousness" (8;45). Placing Thought before Being is by necessity placing the thought of a 'hidden' subject before Being:13 the movement of the logic is not objective but thoroughly subjective ("For whom should the Idea prove itself?", Schelling asks. "For itself?" (153;154)) The alleged self-movement, the 'autonomous' development of the process, is a fiction. It is always the philosophical subject who guides the system to its 'goal':14 One can understand that the subject does not remain still... But an empty concept, which Hegel declares even being to be, does not yet, because it is empty, have any compulsion to fill itself. It is not the concept which fills itself but rather the thought, i.e. that I, the philosopher, can feel a need to progress from the empty to the full (138; 143). The 'necessity' is mere appearance. Hegel's 'objective' Concept is no more than a concealed anthropomorphism (132; 138-9). That is to say, the development of the Logic is not internal, objective, or organic, but imposed by the hidden subject; the apparent objectivity is a subjective construction. The 'real' impetus for dialectical movement is always the covert subject; the development is not autonomous but instead the product of the concealed T. Hegel "sought to breathe a life, an inner compulsion to progress" (139;144) - but the 'internal dynamic' remained nothing other than the (concealed) philosophizing subject, masquerading as the Deity. For Schelling, Hegel has not shown the structure of God's thought - he has shown, albeit in covert fashion, the structure of Hegel's thought. What Hegel presents us with is thus the inversion of philosophy and its ground - which is tantamount to the absolutizing of the cogito.15 Modern thought - from Descartes to Hegel - is exposed as not only 'stuck on the What' but also, correspondingly, as intransigent^ self-centred, self- grounding. Where Hegel sees Descartes as instituting "the most interesting idea of modern times"16 - "Thought as Being and Being as Thought", inseparably bound together in the cogito11 - Schelling sees only the instigation of modernity's absolutizing of subjectivity, and hence the further concealment of our ontological ground. It is not the case, Schelling 276</page><page sequence="5">maintains, that the sum is enclosed within the cogito ; what is enclosed is only the sum qua cogitans, the I in a particular mode , the I "in that way of being which one calls thinking" (10;47). For Schelling, [t]he Sum which is contained in the Cogito does not, then, have the significance of an absolute I am, but only the significance of an *1 am in one way or another ..(10;47). The subject is not the absolute ground; far from 'containing' Being, self-consciousness is only a particular manifestation of Being. Without seeing itself as a mode of Being (and not 'Being itself'),18 Hegel's thought was bound to succumb to the fallacious hypostatization Schelling exposes. iii God Beyond Being A crucial point for Schelling, then, is the primacy of Being over Thought (and thus over the thinking subject). We must make a distinction between Being per se and the particular modes of Being: thought is a mode of Being, not Being itself; Being is more than 'simply' a determination of essence (W 13, 163). So Being is not 'thinking thinking itself', but is prior to thought - and "this insight is sealed in the very failure of the immanent attempt of autonomous self-foundation".19 The 'negative' speculation of Hegelianism has forgotten that the nature of Being is: to be, independent of and prior to any conceptualization. As a result, it has forgotten its own existence: Pure or infinite potency (the beginning of negative philosophy) is the content which is identical with thinking and, therefore, because it does not go towards thinking (for it is identical with it) can come only out of thinking. On the other hand, mere being is the content which is not identical with thinking, and in fact, at first excludes it... In the fact that this has been overlooked lies the great misunderstanding of our time.20 Ontological difference - insurmountable and irreducible - is thus articulated within what is so often taken to be the culmination of metaphysics.21 Schellingian thought may have seemed to Heidegger the high- water mark of 'onto-theo-logic'22 and "the knowing conquest of Being";23 but - as Frank has pointed out - that condition where "the subject of modern philosophy experiences itself as not-being-ground-of- its-own-subsistence has never been more clearly articulated in modern times than in... the philosophy of Schelling", a thinker for whom "self- consciousness presented itself from the very beginning as a relation that comes about only on the precondition of a grounding identity that escapes the play of relations as such".24 Being is now seen as the limit of 277</page><page sequence="6">reflection - and "to pursue this consequence does not lead to the completion of idealism, but to its abolition".25 Reason undoes itself, it demonstrates its own inadequacy: "Reason unfolds the inner structure of self-determination, but can never penetrate behind the primary existence of the self which does the determining."26 Discursive thought ultimately shows itself to have its basis in pre-discursive, pre-conceptual reality. Ideas presuppose a more fundamental' existence. Nonetheless, Schelling's importance lies not just in his insistence on a pre-conceptual ground to thinking (vital as this may be for ushering in the multiform philosophies of finitude which follow on from Idealism). Schelling goes further: he perceives that the recognition of this ontological ground is itself an idea - albeit an inverted idea (die umgekehrte Idee (W 13, 162)) - and is thus a recognition which remains at the conceptual level. (Schelling's point, that is to say, is not merely to argue for the ontological priority of Being qua the presupposition of Thought; he is also urging against a purely conceptual critique of the priority of the conceptual.) Only an 'ek-static' leap beyond reason lifts us to the Absolute Prius , the source of All (both potency and actuality), the Überseiendes .45 The I, the subject, "cannot stop at what is enclosed in thought" (W 11,569). Pure That-ness, sheer positive existence, can be reached only by reason going 'outside itself', becoming ek-static; the mere concept of existence can never attain anything other than the thought of the pure That. Reason reaches "the point where it must dismiss the contemplative life" (W1 1,566), the point where conceptualization ends and sheer awe takes over (W 10,230). The critique of Hegel's hyperbolic claims for Thought is thus more than an academic dispute: it is about a 'spiritual' commitment. (This said, Schelling also urges that, once we have experienced the non-conceptual awe of the Das , we call upon reason to help schematize the Was of this Das : 'negative' philosophy determines possible formal structures; 'positive' philosophy, beginning from immediate experience, furnishes 'examples' of the former's conclusions, via what Schelling terms "metaphysical empiricism", metaphysisches Empirismus (W 13, 114). The combination of logical and quasi-mystical experience is to work in such a way that, from the experience of supreme awe, the religious mind can then piece together historical instantiations and 'effects' of divine Providence - awe in the face of direct, non-rational experience of the impredicable leads to partial a posteriori schematization and thus to a 'positive' relationship between the Absolute and reason (W13,171). For Schelling, reason and its 'Other' are both vital: it is only through reason that we can test the validity of religious and theological hypotheses (W12,122ff); conversely, it is only by pushing reason to its 278</page><page sequence="7">very limits that we have any hope of trans-rational insight into the 'ecstasy' beyond subject-object dualism, into the Uberseiendes , the source of all. Negative philosophy, that is, can demonstrate its own dependence upon the prior freedom of God. Indeed, reason, for Schelling, must postulate the undifferentiated Gottheit beyond essences and predicates. Once we have arrived at this Other of reason, we return to rationality: it is this non-rational awareness of the Das which can imbue our thinking about the effects of the Das with the necessary guard against pure idealism. The mind can now see beyond its own play; it can recognize or intuit a volition other than its own.)28 The key point is as follows. Schelling's 'un-saying' of Idealism does not only mean the primacy of Being over Thought - for, by insisting that the critique of Idealism be more than some umgekehrte Idee, and by thus gesturing towards the very basis of any conception of Being, Schelling also restates the ancient conviction that the highest point of all 'is* beyond Being, Überseiendes. God, Schelling suggests, cannot be contained by any predicate - even Being;29 eternal Freedom must, of necessity, be able both to be and to be otherwise (if it can be pinned down to a single predicate it is no longer free.) The Absolute is beyond conception; its perpetual movement evades thought's structures.30 God's absolute Freedom, that is, is never subordinate to a process which leaves the Divine "not free of this world, but burdened with it instead" (159; 159) and which means God sacrificing Freedom (160;160); no grandiose Ontological Argument is primary (13-29&amp;63-68;49-56&amp;87-9). (Ontological arguments prove only the existence of the essence in pure thought ( reinen Denken) - pure being-in-reason, "God enclosed [eingeschlossen] inside the concept" (W1 1,273)). Schelling's Absolute - an Absolute whose essence is the freedom to be what it chooses - is Beyond-Thought;31 we can only know it in its manifestations. If it could be known, it would not be the Absolute Prius ; if it is Absolute, it cannot be reduced to a single predicate. The only definitive statement we can make of it is that it is Freedom - and, as such, it is free to be either P or non-P. Eternal Freedom is, ultimately, unthinkable. Qua absolute freedom, God is beyond both essence and Being: "God... in himself is not being but the pure freedom of being or not being and thus over being, as former thinkers have called him";32 "God is outside of being, above being, but he is not only by himself free from being, that is, he is also a pure freedom to be or not to be, to accept being or not to accept it";33 "The perfect spirit transcends every kind of being".34 The Schellingian God 'is', to borrow Levinas's phrases, "a surplus always exterior to the totality",35 "a God not contaminated by Being".63 The Schellingian God 'is' beyond onto- theological containment. 279</page><page sequence="8">What Schelling articulates, then, is the movement from a ) a suspicion about the possibility of thought containing Being to b) a deeper suspicion about the thought of Being-before-thought, a thought which remains (however negatively) inscribed within and prescribed by metaphysics. 'Being', in other words, is itself under suspicion; it is not to be represented fundamentally, "in the sense of ground".37 Rather, 'Being' is refused onto- theological primacy: the Gottheit is beyond Being. (Schelling, we can be sure, would concur with Jean-Luc Marion that "to be no longer able to think, when it is a question of God, indicates neither absurdity nor impropriety, as soon as God himself, in order to be thought, must be thought as... that which surpasses, detours, and distracts all thought, even nonrepresentational."38) Schelling's apophaticism, I would thus suggest, represents a major challenge to the onto-theology of what we might term 'Scotist modernity' (the insistence, that is, on the primacy of the summum ens , rather than the (Platonic) Divine-Beyond). Whether or not we can think otherwise than Being, he at least alerts us to the (negative) thought that, even accepting the limitations of thought about Being, God is no more contained by 'Being' than Being is by Thought. What was apparently a closed issue - after the reversal of the Areopagite's Platonic distinction - is burst open: Schelling gestures toward a god who is not the Qui est or the god of philosophy, neither an alter-ego nor a re-edition of the self. After an impasse of half a millennium, the question of the Divine epekeina tes ousias is re-instated.39 iv The Process of God Beyond Being One further point needs consideration, however: if Schelling is now to be viewed as re-instating a Platonic apophaticism, does this not - by implication - serve to confirm Hegelianism? That is, if Schelling's Omega is now viewed as transposable with Plato's Alpha, is Hegelian circularity not just unbroken but somehow complete? Is Schelling, in other words, 'trapped in the spell of anamnesis' ? To answer this - in the negative - we need to consider, finally, how Schelling's reinstated apophaticism is fused with a (distinctly modern) temporal-historical awareness. When he comes to 'address' the God epekeina tes ousias , Schelling, as we have seen, deems 'Being' too constrictive of that which is free to either be or not be. As we have also seen, this refusal of any primacy for Being aligns Schelling, quite self-consciously, with the negative theology of ancient Platonism. However, this ancient alignment does not involve his rejecting the 'process-thinking' and 'genetic philosophy' developed by the Glaubensphilosophen and further refined in his own 280</page><page sequence="9">earlier work:40 because 'Being' is too constrictive, so Schelling is more inclined to talk of the free process of God41 rather than God's static 'is- ness'; God's becoming takes precedence over God's Being.42 In one sense, such 'temporalized' spirituality is typical of its age: it is precisely the process of God, after all, which Hegel claims to have understood and to have seen to its completion; the circle, for Hegel, is now 'complete', muthos overcome by logos. But what differentiates Schelling's notion of divine process is that the Platonic Beyond remains beyond: it is not sublated by the system; rather, qua future-directed, free process, it undermines any conceptual claim upon it. For Schelling, God's process is ongoing; the causa sui is as much a future hope as a present reality.43 There is no conception here of an Hegelian (circular) Return to the Same: "For consciousness the true God is not a God who is but who is always becoming" (W 11,177). As a result, "[t]he knowledge of the true God remains a challenge" (Wll,177).44 So, contra Hegel (once more), there is no attempt to produce a 'completed' subjective ousiology; rather, Schelling portrays a kind of cosmic protention, a messianic history oriented toward the future, toward the Noch-Nicht (to employ Bloch's Schelling-inspired term45). God's complete self-revelation comes only at the end of time, not at the end of the philosopher's system (W7,404); even to say 'God exists' is, for Schelling, as much an anticipation as a description.46 The work of positive philosophy - "the continuing demonstration [Erweis], ever growing and becoming stronger with each step, of the actual existing God [des wirklich existierenden Gottes ]" - will go on for all time: "the realm of actuality is not a finished one, but is rather one continually approaching its completion (W 13, 13)". 47 God is becoming real (W8,308); God is "that which shall be " (W12,33). (God's free process is beyond what Marion has termed "the idolatrous primacy of a human point of view".48) Where an 'ontologized understanding' would reduce the future to the present ("The present alone dominates. There is no real future!"49), the Schellingian 'system' is shaped by 'futurity', die Zukunftigkeit. Telos becomes eschaton ; salvation is an event yet to happen. There is no onto-theological closure here; the dream of a completed process remains just that: a dream. And there is no primacy of the Now, or of 'origin'; rather, we have a radical openness. If Hegelian historicism claims to overcome Platonic aporiai , to 'complete the circle' and apotheosize man, Schelling applies his version of cosmic historicism, his 'effraction of circulation', to precisely the opposite effect - namely, to underline our finitude, and to re-inforce the 'beyondness' of the divine. 281</page><page sequence="10">y Conclusion Schelling's religiosity is not a mere optional extra, an arcane addendum which bears no central importance to his rightly-celebrated Hegel- critique.85 Rather, the dynamic driving this critique is, ultimately, Schelling's profoundly religious concerns regarding a) the idealized dissolution of God into 'mere thought', and b) the resultant divinization of the modern subject. And Schelling's apophaticism is not 'merely' the logical outcome of his Hegel-critique: it is implicit throughout, underpinning his assault on Hegel's Absolute claims. Schelling's critique of Hegelianism is at one and the same time an undermining of onto- theology: where Hegel presents the 'full development' of subjectivity as the completion of God's march through history and return to Himself, Schelling sees only the hypostatization of finite, situated thought. Far from completing the onto-theological circular process which overcomes all otherness and 'thus' achieves the ultimate Identity, the Schellingian subject is now aware of a profound difference between itself and its unfinished divine 'Ground'. Furthermore, although this awareness (of what we might term the Difference of Identity and Difference) is, as I have suggested, a re-instatement of Platonic negative theology, it is also a re- invigoration: because Schellingian apophaticism is unbound by static categories and instead temporalized, orientated by and toward the future, so it avoids pure nostalgia for some ancient 'epoch of truth' . The cost of forgetting this re-instated yet re-invigorated maior dissimilitudo is not just that Schelling's critique of Hegelianism is torn from its wider, religious context. It is also that Schelling's profound challenge to onto-theology - a challenge which represents the central thrust of his Hegel-critique - remains an untapped resource for contemporary thought.

See Werke vol.7, p.406 (trans., p.87): "[The Divine Ground] has no predicates except lack of predicates, without its being naught or a non-entity... [It is] the 'groundless* which precedes all basis". 30 It is because God is supremely free, "the most free being of all", that He is not the preserve of any single religion, but is revealed in all religions: "Christianity", Schelling writes, "is only a phenomenon which I am trying to explain" ( Werke vol. 14, p.201). 3 1 Cf. Werke vol. 1 2, p. 100, and vol. 1 3, p.338. 32 Werke vol. 12, p.58: "das Gott... der an sich nicht gehend, sondem der lauter Freiheit zu seyn oder nicht zu seyn ist, der Ueberseyende, wie ihn auch Aeltere schon genannt haben". 33 Ibid, p.33: "Gott ist in diesem Sinne außer dem Seyn, über dem Seyn, aber er ist nicht bloß an sich selbst frei von dem Seyn, reines Wesen, sondern er ist auch frei gegen das Seyn, d.h. eine lauter Freiheit zu seyn oder nicht zu seyn, ein Seyn anzunehmen oder nicht anzunehmen." 34 Ibid, vol. 1 3, p.256: "Der vollkommene Geist ist über allen Arten des Seyns". 35 Lévinas, Totality and Infinity.

Marion acknowledges his debt to Schelling: "Under the title God Without Being we do not mean to insinuate that God is not, or that God is not truly God. We attempt to meditate on what F.W.Schelling called 'the freedom of God with regard to his own existence'" (p.2). Nonetheless, answering my questions at a public seminar at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, in February 1997, Marion - although praising Schelling as "one of the few who were brave enough to disentangle God and Being" - maintained that Schelling's "heavy metaphysical language" ( Grund or Abgrund , for example) was "the real impeachment to imagine that this [Schellingian] God is free of Being". I suspect that, in this regard, Marion may overlook Schelling's auto-undermining of such "heavy metaphysical language": consider, for example, the change from: Urform ( Werke , vol.1, p.87), to 'excluded' ground (vol.3, p.408) to 'included' (vol.4, pp 253-4), to how we should think of the groundless , rather than primal ground or basis (Of Human Freedom, vol.7, p. 406). .. All this before we reach the later, positive philosophy. 39 See, for further examples, Werke vol.8, p.343, or vol.11, p.566. See also vol.12, p.100, note 1, on God's fundamental difference: He is alone ( Einsame ) and unique (Einzige), separate from everyday, general being (allgemeine Wesen). 40 For example, Werke vol.2, p.39. 41 See, for example, Werke vol.11, p.7, on how Schelling seeks a history of the divine ( Göttergeschichte ), rather than a theory of the divine. 42 Notice, incidentally, that this notion of the divinity's own process was criticized by Schelling's erstwhile acolyte Staudenmaier, in his 1840 Die Philosophie des Christentums : the idea of God becoming God implied some kind of lack. Staudenmaier also criticized Schelling for allowing freedom to be negated by cosmic process, and for confusing fìnitude with sin and metaphysics with grace. In his earlier Der Geist der göttlichen Offenbarung (1837), Staudenmaier had already suggested that Schelling deemed revelation 'necessary', rather than God's free gift. See Thos. O' Meara, Romanticism and Catholicism: Schelling and the Theologians (Notre Dame UP, 1982), pp 143-6. O'Meara also outlines the critical reactions of a number of other Catholic theologians - initially inspired by yet later critics of Schelling - including Drey, Kuhn, Möhler and Deutinger. 43 See Werke vol.13, pp 204, 261, 270. (Cf. vol.7, p.432.) In Schelling's understanding of the theogenic process, the supreme importance of Christianity is that it disrupts the 'unblissfulness' - Unseligheit - of pre-Christian 'circularity'; we advance from the 284</page><page sequence="13">rotary movement of Mythology (BC) to the rectilinear, eschatological movement of Revelation (AD). See, for example, Werke vol.13, pp 273-4. (See also vol.14, pp 81-86, on how pagan Mythology is a simulacrum of the eternal reconciliation which Christ will provide.) For Schelling, 'natural religion' (the shattering and scattering of God's image in polytheism) develops into 'supernatural religion' (Pettine and Pauline monotheistic Revelation) and will culminate, in the future, in Johannine freedom; the Schellingian eschaton will see mind and will united in Geist , Petrine (Catholic) and Pauline (Protestant) churches united in the Johannine (the church of the Holy Spirit, of love), and a completed Christology consummating the epochs of mythology and revelation. See Werke vol.14, pp 296-327 (esp. pp 303-10 and 326-7). See McCarthy, Quest for a Philosophical Jesus , pp 163-213, for an extended discussion of Schelling's Christology. 44 Ibid: "Die Erkenntniß des wahren Gottes bleibt daher immer eine Forderung." See also vol. 12, p.58. 45 For further discussion of Schelling's influence on Bloch, see Colin Harper, 'Dialectic in the Philosophy of Ernst Bloch', unpublished PhD thesis, Queen's University of Belfast, 1993, esp. pp 81-102. 46 Schelling's conviction that the 'world-process' was yet to be completed is made manifest as early as Die Weltalter , where he gives a Trinitarian conception of the Past as the Father, the Present as the Son, and the Future as the (yet-to-come) Spirit ( Werke vol.8, pp 310-14). 80 Werke vol.13, p.13. 47 See also vol.11, p. 139: "God is at every level in the process of becoming, and yet at every level there is a form of this becoming God. There is one God and yet a progressively developing God." 48 Marion, God Without Being , p.8 1 . 49 Johannes Baptist Metz, Theology of the World (trans. Win. Glen-Doepel; London: Burns &amp; Oates, 1969), p. 86.</page></plain_text>
