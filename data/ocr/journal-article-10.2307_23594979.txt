<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES STUDIES ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH by Alexander Rorf The question of the composition of the Book of Jeremiah has generally been equated with the question of the origin of its Deuteronomic element. Duhm believed that this element com prises continual additions to Jeremiah's own words, which were added to the text until the first century BCE. Mowinckel, on the other hand, regarded the bulk of this element as the work of a single author who lived toward the end of the fifth century. The Israeli scholars, Segal and Kaufmann, and more recently others abroad, have argued to the contrary. They contended that the Deuteronomistic element is an integral part of Jeremiah's prophecy resulting from the influence of either the Book of Deuteronomy or the homiletical style prevalent in the ancient Israelite liturgy. The present author recognizes the fact that the stylistic link between the Books of Jeremiah and Deuteronomy admits of several complementary explanations. He therefore attempts to examine the question of the composition of Jeremiah without relying exclusively on stylistic criteria. He compares the following parallel passages: xxi:l-7 // xxxvii:3-10; xxi:8-10// xxxviii:l, 3-6; xxii:l-5//xxi:llb-12a; vii:l-15//xxvi; xxv:l-14//xxxvi. On the basis of a detailed content study, he determines that the first of each of these parallels is a late homi letical reworking of Jeremiah's original words. Such a reworking is likewise present in Jer. xvii: 19-27 as is suggested by its similarity to xxii: 1-5. Jer. xxix: 24-32 and xxvii may also constitute rhetorical adaptations of a biographical narrative. The style and ideas of the rhetorical adaptation are characteristically Deuteronomistic, thus confirming the views of Duhm and Mowinckel. As for Jer. vii: 1-15 form-critical as well as stylistic considerations support the conclusion of Skinner and Welch that the original passage is found in vss. 4,9-14. A comparison of the biographical and rhetorical parallels shows that while the biographer dealt accurately with details, his conception of history was shallow. By contrast, the rhetorical adaptor was a theologian who recognized a divine plan in the events which culminated in the Exile. The rhetorical adaptation does not reflect, neither in its form nor in its content, the situation of the Jewish community at the beginning of the post-exilic period. Its main purpose was to emphasize the value of repentence, in opposition to those historiographical and prophetic currents (Kings, Deutero-Isaiah) which stressed the infallibility of the Lord's word. BIBLICAL STUDIES Ezekiel's Code (Ezek. xl-xlviii) and its Relation to the Priestly School by Menahem Haran After a survey of the relevant research the author presents his opinion that there is insufficient philological ground for denying the authenticity of Ezekiel's Law Code, and</page><page sequence="2">Π ENGLISH SUMMARIES that the signs of compilation and ellipses discernible in this Code may be considered as primary. As for this Code's composition, the author finds that it consists of two types of sections: visions describing the temple complex and the prophet's guided tour through its structures, and legal sections presented as the word of God. The visions are stylisti cally and literarily similar to Ezekiel's prophecies in the earlier parts of the book, especially to the visions of destruction in Chaps, viii-xi. The legal material, by contrast, is rooted in a priestly-juridical heritage which had come down to the prophet. It is unjustifiable to discern separate authors in this Code, but one can admit the existence of two distinct literary patterns, each of which results from a different relationship and both of which were woven together into a single composition. As for the contents, the sections are joined together into three continuous series: descrip tion of the temple's form, its parts and appurtenances (xl : 1 — xliv : 3); rules of cult and regulations to be practised around the temple (xliv : 4 — xlvi : 24); the land and certain aspects related to it (xlvii-xlviii). Each series starts with similar warnings pro nounced by the 'man' who guides the prophet, or by the Lord, admonishing him to pay heed to what follows. Certain sections in the first and second series which seem to be out of place in their locations are shown to actually be called for in their present contexts. The author is of the opinion that the indubitable contradictions between Ezekiel's Code and Ρ prove conclusively that despite agreement on matters of principle the two works cannot be directly dependent on each other — Ezekiel certainly did not 'read' P, and the writers of Ρ certainly never saw Ezekiel's Code nor did they quote a single letter from it. The connection between the two can only be indirect, to wit, the result of belonging to a single school marked by peculiar spiritual, ideological and literary characteristics. As for the relative ages of the two, it is the author's contention that no matter which way the two are compared, the historical cross-section reflected in Ρ is earlier than the one seen in Ezekiel's Code. Ρ constitutes a literary-ideological treatise which demonstrates much more completeness, authenticity and originality in comparison with Ezekiel's Code — so much so that the latter can only be defined as a late, impover ished extension of the school whose creativity reached its model in P. Various examples are presented in support of this thesis. Since Ρ was not a 'living' entity against the background of Ezekiel's activity, and since, moreover, P's historical provenance is earlier than that of Ezekiel, the author comes to the further conclusion that P, as an expression of a creative school, had already been forced off stage before the time of Ezekiel and even before that of Josiah, whose cultic reform was motivated solely by the ideology of D. This conclusion tallies with the author's results arrived at elsewhere (in Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel, to be published in a not too distant future) that for dating Ρ we may look to a pre Josianic cultic reform, which also involved cult centralization, but was conducted by Hezekiah (II Kings xviii : 4, 22). It seems likely that it was the period of Manasseh that forced the priestly school off stage and practically obliterated it, and in such a state it was found in Ezekiel's time. Various examples are brought to illustrate this conclusion too. As an epigonic growth of the priestly school, Ezekiel's constitution could be formed only by being attached to the general priestly ideology while, at the same time, being completely detached from the school's exemplary product, that is, from P. However, when Ezra put the Pentateuch together from its various sources and turned into the cornerstone of the Jewish communal life (Neh. viii-x), Ρ came up from oblivion and,</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES III being now part of the canonized Torah, realized even a greater prominence than it had enjoyed previously. Thus, Ezra, the scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, himself a priest, found a direct access to the early writings of the school, while the priest-prophet Ezekiel was endowed only with its style and spirit. THE TRANSLATION OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC EXPRESSIONS IN TARGUM JOB by Raphael Weiss [ז"ל] This article systematically examines the treatment of anthropomorphic expressions in the Massoretic Text by the targumist to the Book of Job. This includes his technique of rendering verbal anthropomorphisms and terms regarding the attribution of human parts of the body to the Divinity. With regards to verbs, there is a noticeable lack of consistency, sometimes even within the same verse. Moreover, the same translation methods are often employed in rendering terms referring both to man and to God. This latter phenomenon casts doubt upon the anti-anthropomorphic tendencies of these targums. In the majority of cases, the rendition of terms describing parts of the human body is literal (eleven different body parts are mentioned 40 times according to their simple meaning!), even where other targumists chose to avoid a literal rendition of the text. Moreover, instances in which the rendition is non-literal do not necessarily point to the deliberate avoidance of anthropomorphisms, but may rather be explained as linguistic usage or interpretation. THE COMMENTARY OF R. SAMUEL BEN MEIR TO QOHELETH by Sara Japhet The Commentary of R. Samuel b. Meir (henceforth: RaSHbaM) to Qoheleth was first published by A. Jellinek in 1855, and was warmly accepted by D. C. Ginsburg in 1861. However, several years later, its authenticity was questioned by D. Rosin. The purpose of the present article is twofold: to deal with some of the Commentary's ex egetical principles, and to delve into the question of its authenticity. A. The Commentary is built according to clear exegetical principles, which are illustrated in its external arrangement, and also expresses a general conception of exegesis. (1) RaSHbaM distinguishes two layers in the Book of Qoheleth: the original work, Qoh. i: 3 — xii: 7, written by King Solomon and forming a literary whole, and the redactional framework, written later and consisting of Qoh. i: 1-2; xii: 8-14. In this framework the essence of the whole book is expressed by the conception: everything that exists in the world is 'vanity'(הבל). RaSHbaM accepts the conception of the framework and demonstrates it by explaining thenumerous occurrences of the expression גמזה הבל, each according to its specific context. Since Qoheleth is perceived as a literary unity, its parts are explained as complementing each other, and cross-references are used in the Commentary to dovetail various verses.</page><page sequence="4">IV ENGLISH SUMMARIES (2) An important factor of the Commentary is the conscious recognition of three differen tiated areas requiring explanation. Accordingly, the Commentary on each biblical division is frequently divided into two or three parts: a literary section, providing notes on context and on literary structure; a section dealing with subject matter, giving the contents of each division in pharaphrase and clarifying its meaning, and a section devoted to philology, discussing specific items. The division into parts, the relationship between them, and the exegetical methods used in each section, are demonstrated by an analysis of the Commentary to Qoh. ix: 1 and viii: 10-13. An important byproduct of this analysis is the fact that RaSHbaM did not adhere to the division into verses; he commented upon short sections, i.e., small literary units, often comprising more than one verse. The boundaries of these sections can be adduced from the division into exegetical areas, and from the extent of the paraphrased parts. B. The question of the authenticity of the Commentary should be dealt with from two aspects: a thorough examination of the arguments against its authenticity, and an unpre judiced investigation into the relationship between the Commentary to Qoheleth and all that is known of the biblical exegesis of RaSHbaM. (1) Rosin raised two arguments to deny authenticity: the existence of discrepancies and contradictions between the Commentary of RaSHbaM to the Pentateuch and the Qoheleth Commentary, and divergencies in style and terminology between the two. To prove the first argument he adduces one single example: the interpretation of Qoh. xii: 2 in oitu and in Gen. xxii:13. However, it should be noted that the above-mentioned contradiction is actually nothing more than a difference of emphasis. Even though the second argument of D. Rosin is supported by several examples, it fails to prove the point. A lack of uniformity and the absence of a terminological system are permanent traits of the works of RaSHbaM and characteristic of his style. This is proven by two phenomena: the use of several terms to denote a single matter, and the use of one term for different subjects. These same phenomena — within the framework of the language and terminology of RaSHbaM — are also present in the Commentary to Qoheleth. (2) Investigation has revealed a close relationship between the Commentary to Qoheleth and the Commentary of RaSHbaM to the Pentateuch. The only feasible explanation for this phenomenon seems to be the supposition that both commentaries are various expressions of the same creative hand. There are explicit references from one commentary to the other, some of them bilateral. A remarkable example is Deut. xix: 5 and Qoh. x: 10, where a unique interpretation is repeated in both sources, each quoting the other. Another important example is Deut. xx: 5-9, where RaSHbaM quotes the main ideas of his unique commentary on Qoh. i: 3-11. The full meaning of this passage is possible only by a comparison with the Commentary to Qohelet. The same relationship also exists between the Commentary to Qohelet and the biblical interpretations of RaSHbaM quoted in R. Abraham b. Azriel's Arugat Ha-Bosem,z.g., the explanations of Is. xl: 20 and Qoh. iv: 13 supplement each other. Another important factor is the great similarity, in exegetical principles and in detailed explanations, between the Commentary to Qohelet and the other works of RaSHbaM. From numerous examples, the following are enumerated: (a) the principle of the chiastic structure of the verse, explained in Ex. ii: 6 and in Qoh. ii: 1-2; (b) the phenomenon of the 'typological number' explained and demonstrated in Qoh. viii: 12; vii: 19 and in Gen. xxxi:7; Lev. xxvi:26 et al.; (c) the unique case of the nomen rectum omitted from the con struct state, explained in Qoh. viii: 12, in Ex. xv: 2, and in Arugat Ha-Bosem as the explanation to בחיל (II Kings xviii: 17). It is thus most logical to conclude that the Commentary to Qohelet is a unified composition bearing the marks of the creative personality of RaSHbaM.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES THE ROMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT AND THE JEWS UNDER CONSTANTINE by Amnon Linder Both modern and traditional historiography attribute to Constantine the Great a major role in the formation of the attitude of Christian Europe towards the Jews. The main documentary basis for this contention consists of various laws enacted by Constantine and preserved in several legal collections, mainly the Theodosian Code. A detailed examination of the relevant laws results, however, in the following conclusions: a. The legal sources at our disposal transmit Constantine's original legislation in a highly fragmentary and tendentiously revised form. b. Most of the relevant laws were enacted during the last years of Constantine, a period in which he exercised sole rule over the Empire and was able to implement a consistent policy of Christianization. c. The laws concerning Jewish self-government reflect at least two changes of policy on the part of the Imperial authorities, which started with a repeal of the traditional privi leges of the Jewish organs of self-government, but consequently granted them important privileges. The new legislation reinforced an Empire-wide system of Jewish self-govern ment, subject to the Patriarchs in Palestine and centered everywhere on the synagogues as nuclei of communal organization. Jewish communal leaders achieved, on the basis of this legislation, a legal status similar to that of the pagan priests and the highest ranks of the Christian clergy. d. A militant anti-Jewish policy, inspired by the missionary ideology of the Church and implemented by the State machinery is evident in the legislation that deals with proselyt ism of pagans and Christians as well as conversion of Jews. e. The official policy towards Palestine was aimed at its complete Christianization and the obliteration of its Jewish character. It was energetically carried out mainly in Jeru salem, which was rebuilt by Constantine as the new Christian Capital of the new Christian Roman Empire. f. In its dealings with the Jews the government took care to avoid radical legislative measures and acted within the framework of the classical law, using traditional concepts and means as a basis for its new legislation. g. The propaganda that accompanied the anti-Jewish measures emphasized the major role played by Hadrian in the adoption of similar measures by the Imperial authorities, in accord with the general positive appreciation of this emperor by fourth-century Christian and pagan writers. The attitude of the Imperial authorities towards the Jews under Constantine was, con sequently, of a rather inconsistent character; some of the known legislative texts reflected militant anti-Jewish policies while others reinforced the cohesion of the Jews throughout the Roman Empire. They were obviously enacted by an essentially conservative govern ment-apparatus faced by new situations and forced to act by various pressure-groups, hence the heterogeneous character of this body of legislation.</page><page sequence="6">VI ENGLISH SUMMARIES SOME COMMENTS ON THE GENEALOGY OF THE PALESTINIAN GEONIM by Moshe Gil The identities and genealogies of the heads of the Palestinian yeshiva during the ninth and tenth centuries have long been rather obscure. A Genizah fragment from the Taylor Schechter collection sheds some light on this matter. It was first edited by S. Abramson and a reading somewhat different from his is here presented. The leader of the Pales tinian party in the dispute with Saadya Gaon about the calendar (921/2) is identified with certainty as Aaron b. Meir (not Aaron b. Moses b. Meir); it appears that it was his father, Meir, who held the office of Gaon during that dispute. Some of the genealo gies of the other heads of the yeshiva are also reconstructed, and their chronology as well, with a five years approximation. ON SOME NEW JEWISH INSCRIPTIONS IN YEMEN by Η. Ζ. Hirschberg The article reviews some aspects not discussed by the authors of earlier articles on the inscription discovered at the mosque of Bayt al-Hadir (Tarbiz, XLII, 1973, pp. 302 307), and especially its connection with inscriptions recently discovered in Yemen on synagogues of the pre-Islamic era and with some new inscriptions relating to the Jewish King Yusuf 'As'ar Yath'ar Dhu-Niiwas, who reigned in Himyar in the years 518 (?) 525, was defeated by the 'Ethiopian' King Ella Asbaha and died in battle. The author reaches the conclusion that the Bayt al-Hadir inscription dates from the end of the pre-Islamic or the beginning of the Islamic era. THE CONCEPT OF 'POSSIBILITY' IN MAIMONIDES by Ν. L. Rabinovitch Maimonides analysed the concept of possibility and distinguished between a 'logical impossibility' which stems from a contradiction and a 'physical impossibility' which is determined by the nature of physical reality. Correspondingly a logical possibility is such as is not logically impossible, neither is it deducible from the axioms of logic; a physical possibility can, on the other hand, only be recognized empirically. Moreover, empirical possibility is quantifiable and this enables us to define a criterion of probability to distinguish between (a) the effects of chance, (b) those of purposive voluntary causes and (c) the consequences of nature. Utilizing these ideas enabled Maimonides to radically alter the Aristotelian conception of natural philosophy and to reject necessitarianism to make room for the belief in Creation and Providence while retaining the universality of natural law.</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES VII CONCERNING THE SOURCE OF TAHKEMONI by Joseph Dana After having completed Mafiberot Iti'el, his translation of the Book of Maqamot of Al Hariri (1054-1122), R. Judah al-Harizi greatly repented his having tended strange pastures, and therefore decided to author an original Hebrew work, Sefer Tahkemoni, as his contri bution to Hebrew literature. However, a study and comparison of other sources with the maqamot found in Tahkemoni has shown that in the composition of his magnum opus, too, Al-Harizi utilized foreign sources and was influenced by them. No fewer than eight maqamot were found to be adaptations from the maqamot of Al-Hamdani (967-1007). It is important to note that R. Judah al-Harizi failed to allude to the latter. The present article is devoted to the twenty-second maqama of Al-Hamdani, almaiirya, which in Hebrew garb is located in Section 34 of Tahkemoni. In this maqama, which in Arabic is entitled 'The Invitation of the Merchant', R. Judah al-Harizi preserved the traditional pattern of the maqama of Al-Hamdani. Nevertheless, Al-Harizi chose motifs which could suit the Hebrew reader, and by not revealing the denouement, introduced tension into the plot of the maqama. Al-Hamdani, on the other hand, placed greater stress on the historical and linguistic aspects of the maqama, rather than of the plot. Al-Harizi was most selective in his choice of particulars and deleted those details which did not appear to be an integral part of the maqama. He also played down hyperboles and rhetorical questions. As a result, the narrative is much more intensive. One is struck by the fact that R. Judah al-Harizi attempted to conceal the sources employed by him, although such a practice is not unfamiliar in the field of Mediaeval Hebrew literature. LOVE OF ,THE GOOD, THE PLEASANT AND THE BENEFICIAL' IN THE WRITINGS OF R. ISRAEL NAJARA AND R. ABRAHAM AZULAI by Dov Zlotnick In the year 1619 the Kabbalist, R. Abraham Azulai, took refuge in the city of Gaza from a plague that had driven him first from Hebron and then from Jerusalem. At that time the poet R. Israel Najara was the rabbi of the city. The friendship of the two is attested by a short poem that R. Najara wrote in honour of R. Azulai's Or ha-hamma. In another poem by R. Najara in which he deals with 'six5 kinds of love, there is a corruption in the text of the printed edition and MSS, the correct reading being 'three'. The three kinds of love also appear in the Introduction to R. Azulai's commentary to the Mishnah, Ahavah ba-Ta anugim. Their probable immediate source (in the case of both the Kabbalist and the poet) is Albo's lkkarim. R. Azulai's application of the three kinds of love to the six Orders of the Mishnah provides us with an answer to the problem as to how he can term Bet par'oh, his apparent commentary to Nezikin (normally the fourth Order of the Mishnah), 'part three' of his entire commentary. Although the title page, Bet par'oh, appears with the commentary to the Order Nezikin, and although a previous owner of the MS (who saw parts of the commentary not available to the writer) attests it to be the title page to that Order, the writer has attempted to prove that it is instead the title page to the Orders Kodasim and Joharot.</page><page sequence="8">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES AN AKKADIAN CONFIRMATION FOR THE MEANING OF TEROmA by Jacob Milgrom In Tarbiz, XLII (1972/3), pp. 1-11, the author had come to the conclusion, on the bib lical evidence alone, that teriima means 'gift' and that its denominative herim in the Priestly source of the Torah denotes 'set aside, dedicate'. At the time, he was unaware of W. von Soden's article in TJgarit Forschungen, II (1970), pp. 269-272 (see now: AHw, s.v. Ramu III) in which he had derived the same meanings for the Akkadian verb ramu (Assyrian riamu) and its nominal derivatives rimu II (strictly, a cultic 'gift'), rimi/tu and tarimtu. The last mentioned noun is especially significant since it is the exact cognate of biblical teriima and it appears for the first time at Mari (ARM I, 80 : 7), i.e., it is a West Semitic term. THE ROLE OF THE PRIESTLY BETH DIN IN THE DECLARATION OF THE NEW MONTH by Μ. Kurtstag This paper analyses the mishna Rosh Hashana i : 7, which appears to imply that the Priestly Beth Din fulfilled a very decisive role in the determination of the new month. After critically surveying the approaches of several scholars, the author asserts that, in fact, the Priests had no decisive role in the fixing of the new month. He suggests that the mishna dates from the time when the Great Sanhedrin sat in Yabneh. Why then were the Priests involved at all? Two possibilities are considered: a. The proposition of C. Albeck, viz., that before the witnesses of the new moon would embark on a long journey to give evidence before the Great Sanhedrin, they would consult a local halachic authority as to whether their evidence was of any legal signi ficance. b. The author proposes that the function of the local authority was to give a testimonial vouching for the integrity of the witnesses and only incidentally examined their evidence. The Priestly Beth Din was such a local tribunal situated in Jerusalem to whom the wit nesses mentioned in the mishna were known. ADDITIONAL NOTES TO Ά HALAKHIC INSCRIPTION FROM THE BETH-SHEAN VALLEY' by Y. Sussmann The author adduces additional notes and corrigenda to his above-mentioned article which appeared in Tarbiz, XLIII (1973/4), pp. 88-158.</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES IX NOTES TO 'POLYGAMY — NEW INFORMATION FROM THE GENIZAH' (Tarbiz, XLIII, 1973/4, pp. 166-198) by Mordechai A. Friedman Notes to the authors recent article on polygamy (polygyny) in the Genizah documents are offered here. These include the description of an unedited text, dated 1148, setting forth a settlement by which a wife collected most of her ketubba debt and her husband undertook to pay her the remainder and divorce her were he to marry another wife (MS Mosseri VII30). Also found is a brief discussion on the monogamy clause commonly written in the Egyptian Jewish marriage contracts from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and evidence for inter preting it as empowering the wife to demand payment of her delayed marriage settlement, were her husband to marry a second wife, without necessarily demanding a divorce. This is contrasted with R. Isaac b. Sheshet's understanding of the somewhat differently worded monogamy clause written in the ketubbot of Toledo, according to which the wife would collect her marriage settlement only when being divorced. TEXTUAL VERSIONS IN COMMENTARIES OF THE EARLY AUTHORITIES by Yedidya Cohen The first part of this note deals with a difficult lectio in the Commentary of Rashi to Yevamot 85a, concerning the rights of a widow married to a High Priest (or of a divorced woman or a woman who has performed haliza married to a common priest), to the income derived from her usufruct property. According to the printed version of Rashi, such a union was 'never considered to be a marriage' ('שלא היו לו בה נשואין מעולם'). This explanation is most difficult since established halakha recognizes the fact that this union, although illegal, is nevertheless considered to have been consummated by a marriage. An examination of manuscripts bears out the assumption that the above-mentioned text of Rashi has been corrupted. The version of MS Oxford, Bodleian 367, which reads 'שיהיו בה נשואין משלם', seems to be the correct one. The difficulty appears to have been caused by the interchanging of the ש with עו, by one of the copyists. The second part of this note is devoted to the commentary of R. Samuel b. Meir (RaSHbaM) to Barn Batra 49b. RaSHbaM discusses the condition laid down by the husband wherein he stipulates that he does not commit himself to redeem his wife in the event of captivity ('איני מקבל עלי תקנת פרקונה ואיני חושש בטירות נכסי מלוג'). Here too, the textual reading is most problematic in lieu of the question raised by the Tosaphists (ibid.), who based them selves on the assumption that redemption is a prime right of married women and the husband thus had no permission whatsoever to curtail this right. An additional difficulty is raised by the style of RaSHbaM. These difficulties may be rectified by resource to the reading of RaSHbaM's Commentary found in the Venice 1521 edition of the Babylonian Talmud: 'אני מקבל עלי תקנת טרקונה'.</page><page sequence="10">ENGLISH SUMMARIES Instead of the negative איני, we find here the pronoun אני, thus giving this statement a positive nature. Supporting evidence for this emendation is offered by R. Menahem Ha-Meiri, who in Beit Ha-Befiira to the parallel sugya in Ketubot 83a quotes the above-mentioned version in the name of Jfakhmei Zarfat ('The French Sages'). In the writings of R. Menahem Ha-Meiri, this epithet usually refers to Rabeinu (Jacob) Tarn and to RaSHbaM. ON THE TEXT OF THE 'ALEINTJ PRAYER by S. C. Reif In a recent article in Tarbiz (XLII, pp. 204-208) Y. Elbaum followed earlier scholars in demonstrating the originality of the phrases שהם משתחוים להבל וריק ומתפללים אל אל לא יושיע and ומושב יקרו, and argued that the variant readings which often occur in their place are due to the influence of Christian-Jewish polemics on the Hebrew prayer book. The present writer has already devoted a number of studies to demonstrating the outstanding efforts of R. Shabbethai Sofer of Przemysl (c. 1565-1635) in the area of Hebrew grammar, particularly as it relates to the language of the prayers. In this note he cites that part of his manuscript commentary on the prayer-book which deals with the problem of the texts cited by Elbaum as a further contribution to the discussion and as a characteristic example of R. Shabbetai's work. A FOURTEENTH-CENTURY ASHKENAZI ' YIHUD' TRACTATE (Tarbiz, XLII, 1973, pp. 134 ff.) by Joseph Dan Ε. Kupfer has published the text of a responsum between Rabbi Abraham Klausner and Rabbi Menahem Agler. This exchange of letters dealing with the proper conception of the Yihud — the concept of God and the correct manner of addressing him in prayer — is in a literary form well known since the early thirteenth century. The earlier examples are con sistent in the phrasing of the question, and are usually followed by an answer based upon Ashkenazi Hasidic esoteric doctrine, sometimes including kabbalistic elements. The present responsum includes a completely traditional question, based upon early thirteenth-century theological problems, although the answer is of a popular-philosophical nature, following the teachings of Maimonides.</page></plain_text>
