In this essay I attempt to establish the philosophic context in which Emerson struggled with the problem of natural evil. First, I trace the major role that the death of Ellen, Emerson's young wife, played in leading him to reject the notion that "God" is "a person," to accept the idea that the soul in its solitude is fundamental reality, and to believe, paradoxically, at the same time in the transcendental identity of all individuals. Second, I discuss Emerson's serious considerations, in the late thirties and early forties, that "God" and man are not two distinct conscious entities but are two aspects of Being, "God," the unconscious dynamic of Being, and man, the consciousness of Being. Third, I consider the role that the death of his son, Waldo, played in his subsequent dark speculations about "God," and "the nature of things" in general.2 Fourth, I suggest that Emerson's inability to explain the mystery of evil in the context of his philosophic monism led to the hardening of his cosmic faith that ultimately all is for the good. I assume throughout this essay that Emerson, although he modified his ethical idealism as he grew older, never rejected his philosophic idealism based on his premise that the subjective "I" is the "ultimate reference point of reality," is, in truth, "God."3 I do not doubt, however, that experience forced him to modify his youthful optimism in the ability of the individual to build his own world according "to the pure idea" in his mind (CW, 1:45). My strategy is simple. I trace as well as I can the somewhat erratic unfolding of his thought in his journal, his sermons, his letters, and in his essays. In the late twenties and early thirties, Emerson gradually rejected the hypothesis that "God" is "a person," an entity separate and distinct from man. On 8 February 1831 Ellen died, and he cried out in his journal: "Reunite us, O THE CONCORD SAUNTERER, N.S. Volume 9, 2001</page><page sequence="3">58 The Concord Saunterer thou Father of our Spirits" (JMN, 3:227). He used William Ellery Channing's familial designation of God as "Father of Spirits" also in the first sermon he gave after her death, but rarely, if ever, used the phrase again.4 In this sermon of 20 February 1831 he sought consolation for his broken heart in the idea of God as "a person." In fact, Ellen's death seems to have brought home to him a vivid sense of nersonal "otherness." both human and divine. He wrote his Aunt Marv Moody on the day Ellen died: "I do not know but it is true that I have never known a person in the world in whose separate existence as a soul I could so readily &amp; fully believe &amp; she is present with me now beaming joyfully upon me, in her deliverance &amp; the entireness of her love for your poor nephew."5 Thus at the same time Emerson was debating with himself about whether or not God is "a person," he delivered a sermon about a personal God and wrote a letter to another person about another person whose "soul" seemed to have more of a separate existence than any other person he had ever known. Unquestionably, Emerson knew intimately the exquisite relations of personal "otherness" with a human being, if not with a divine Being. But Ellen's death, if not Ellen herself, also taught Emerson about the religious significance of solitude and self-reliance. When they married, she was tubercular, and he prepared for her early death with a sense of fatality. Two days after their marriage, on 13 March 1829, he delivered a sermon on dying: The hour will come to yourself to die. It will come to each of us. It belongs to God's order—which we call nature as much as hunger or sleep.... In a few years or months or days the symptoms of that change will appear in you. The alarm will sound in the ear of your mind, that you have done with men, and men have done with you. You will be withdrawn by a weakness you cannot simulate, from the living crowd that fill the street. . . . You have retreated to your chamber to a solitude which the world cannot relieve. I say you are alone; it is true you are nursed by the cares and assured of the sympathies of your friends. .. . But alas, my brother, is that solitude less? ... Is not he alone who sees the shades of the last night shutting down over his senses, though the whole world environed his bed, and armies of friends cry out at his side? He continued with Puntan intonation to consider his role as a minister: Into that solitude the man of God shall introduce a sweeter society than the merriment of health has ever made; into that darkness of this world the good pastor shall let in the light of another. ... In that hour, at least, when trifles are neglected and ceremony is forgot, I hope to be understood and esteemed</page><page sequence="4">David Lyttle 59 as an effectual friend, that the tidings which I bring, that the cause in whose strength I come, will give power to my weakness. I that am your fellow in the same fate by God appointed will endeavor to quicken your faith by the same motives that sustain my own. We will talk of the Resurrection from the Dead (The Complete Sermons, 1:239-240). However, Emerson's faith in "the light of another" world and in God as a separate Being diminished after Ellen died; and the tidings he later brought to his listeners were not about the resurrection from the dead or about Dersonal immortality but about the power of self-reliance in this world and the transcendental identity of all individuals. That he learned these things in the dark and cold is a major reason his followers find authentic his affirmation of Being.6 In his loneliness Emerson cried out to Ellen: "Farewell blessed Spirit who hast made me happy in thy life &amp; in thy death make me yet happy in thy disembodied state" (JMN, 3:227). But Ellen sent no palpable message back to him that she endured either as a "disembodied" spirit or as "a person." He continued to plead: "Dear Ellen... O suggest, coming from God's throne, suggest to this lone heart some hint of him" (JMN, 3:240). But he heard from her nothing, not a hint, not a suggestion that she or a personal God existed. He continued to grieve: "Here I sit alone from month to month filled with a deep desire to exchange thoughts with a friend who does not appear" (JMN, 3:272); "she never comes to me" (JMN, 3:285). Then quite unexpectedly Emerson learned from his loneliness that ' one of the arguments with which nature furnishes us for the Immortality of the Soul is ... the awful solitude in which here a Soul lives'YJMN. 3:272). Several vears later, continuing this theme, he observed: "I sit alone &amp; cannot arouse myself to thought[.] I go &amp; sit with my friend &amp; in the endeavor to explain my thought to him or her, I lay bare the awful mystery to myself as never before &amp; start at the total loneliness &amp; infinity of one man' (JMN, 5:224; 1836). The 'Immortality of the Soul"? The "Infinity of one man"? In 1840, he noted: "In all my lectures, I have taught one doctrine, namely, the infinitude of the private man" (JMN, 7:342). And so it seems that Emerson, thrust by fate into a desert of "awful" loneliness, beyond the visceral warmth of associated life, was not illuminated by a supernatural presence but instructed by silence to believe that beyond the loneliness "which the world cannot relieve" is a solitude, indeed, an "isolation," which is "metaphysical" or divine (CW, 3:80). The loss of Ellen taught him that to be an individual is to be alone, and that to be alone is to be, not "lost," but open to the intuition that the individual is unique and infinite "like God," that "the soul gives itself alone, original, and pure, to the Lonely, Original and Pure" (CW, 2:174).7</page><page sequence="5">60 The Concord Saunterer Soon after Ellen died, the young minister wrote a remarkable poem expressing his victory over loneliness and despair: The Soul of thy soul Give up to thy soul— Let it have its way— It is, I tell thee, God himself The selfsame One that rules the Whole Tho' he speaks thro thee with a stifled voice And looks thro' thee shorn of his beams, . . . let thine eyes Look straight before thee as befits The simplicity of Power. . . . Therefore o happy youth Thou art unto thyself a law And since the Soul of things is in thee Thou neediest nothing out of thee Neither of moral nor material The law, the gospel, &amp; the Providence, Heaven, Hell, the Judgment, &amp; the stores Immeasurable of Truth &amp; Good All these thou must find Within thy single mind Or never find. Thou are the law (,JMN, 3:291-92). Thus Emerson concluded that he was the "ultimate reference point of reality," that his "soul" was "God himself," and that all reality he "must find" within his "single mind." As is well-known, his theme of self-reliance is really that of God-reliance; or rather, since he renounced the concept of a personal God and conceived the spiritual identity of an individual and "God" as one identity, his theme of self-reliance—as it is portrayed, for example, in his famous essay of that name—is really his theme of the reliance of Being upon itself, Being consisting in the unity of the Universal, the individual, and the dream of nature. Even so, the feeling of "God" as a personal Otherness lingered with him. In a sermon on 31 July 1831 he informed his congregation that a trust in yourself is the height not of pride but of piety, an unwillingness to learn of any but God himself. . . . Whilst you trust in self—the origin of self must be perceived. The moment a man loses sight of the truth that he did not make himself,—</page><page sequence="6">David Lyttle 61 that he is not a cause, but a mere effect of some other Cause,. . . the moment he lets this truth go, he becomes a bundle of errors and sins" (The Complete Sermons, 3:202). A few years later, however, after gaining more confidence in his theme of identity, he would name man not "a mere effect" and God "some other Cause," but would denominate them as simply two aspects of ineffable Being (hence, himself becoming, in some people's eyes, "a bundle of errors and sins"). The Transcendental Identity of All Individuals Ellen's departure also strengthened Emerson's growing conviction that although each person is a separate and distinct individual in space and time, all individuals are, out of space and time, the universal mind. Two weeks after her death, on 23 February 1831, he confided to himself: "there is one Spirit through many mouths. It will not do to divide or bound what is in itself infinite." "God is everywhere" (JMN, 3:236-38); and a month later he reaffirmed these thoughts in a sermon: "There is one spirit speaking through a myriad mouths. ... It will not do to divide or bound what is in itself infinite.... There is but one source of power, that is, God" (The Complete Sermons, 1:240). In 1836 he refers to "the identity, radical identity of all men; the one mind which makes each the measure of all, which makes each intelligible to all" (JMN, 5:265, 1836). Later he stated that "the reason why the work of genius fits the wants of all ages is because that which is spontaneous is not local or individual but flows from that internal soul which is also the soul of every man" (JMN, 12:389). In "The Over-Soul" he refers to "that Unity ... within which every man's particular being is contained and made one with all other; that common heart'YCW, 2:160).9 In sum, Ellen's death revealed to Emerson 1) that the individual is unique and alone in time and space; and that 2) each individual is also, paradoxically, the universal mind; and that, in addition, this transcendental identity of all individuals is the source of the ability of each individual to sympathize and love others and to be truly self-reliant. Her silent message from the grave was that she and he and all others were One in Over-Soul, that they possessed (in terms of Emerson's own metaphor) One Heart that cradled in its infinitude the preciousness of all individual forms. Emerson assumed this identity near the beginning of Nature ( 1836) where he informs us that "to go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars" (CW, 1:8). One may imagine him in his study in the evening, putting down his pen and paper, entering his garden, and walking there not with God but as God, or as a god, and interpreting the darkening sky with its shining stars to be a symbol of transcendental subjectivity of which all finite beings are points of consciousness.</page><page sequence="7">62 The Concord Saunterer The death of Ellen was for Emerson the beginning of the end of his belief in a personal god, and brought into question for him the credibility of the ultimate reality of the objective world. After Ellen, he knew the material world of bounded forms and entities and their relationships as a world of appearance only, a world in which there are no final answers, a world in which people in death know only what "sleeping Rocks Dream of' (in the poetic words of Jonathan Edwards, the great Puritan mystic, in his essay "Of Being"). After Ellen, Emerson held that final answers lay only "within," are intuitive or subjective, that subjectivity is the "private" man's "infinitude," and that this infinitude is the eternal, universal mind of all individuals. Deity may be Unconscious Late in 1832 Emerson decided that the ministry was "antiquated (JMN, 4:27), resigned his pastorate, and traveled abroad, meeting Thomas Carlyle and other great Romantics whose writings he admired. He returned to America the following year and continued his struggle to clarify his definition of "God." In 1834 he affirmed with pride his "commission to be coeval with the antiquity of the eldest causes," referred to the "All Perceiving Mind," but concluded that "I will trust my instincts" (JMN, 4:283, 285, 292). In this year also he began to associate the term "unconscious ' with the term "God." "Blessed is the child; the Unconscious is ever the act of God himself' (JMN, 4:309-10). "What is the doctrine of infallible guidance . . . but striving to act unconsciously, to resume the simplicity of childhood" (JMN, 4:318). He thought that "the age of puberty . . . is the passage from the Unconscious to the Conscious, . . . from peaceful maternal Reason to hard short-sighted Understanding; from Unity to disunion" (,JMN, 4:348). In general he meant in these quotations by the term "unconscious" unselfconsciousness or spontaneity, the opposite of self-reflective rational thought and was referring to the Romantic theme that one should live innocently in instinctive harmony with God s creation or the nature of things, as supposedly do plants and animals and very young children. His use of the term in this way, however, foreshadowed his speculations that deity is "unconscious" in the sense that deity is not conscious at all. Journal entries between 1835 and 1840 reveal his increasing frustration in defining the term "God": "He [God] is, for I am. Say rather, He is. But in the depth inaccessible of his being he refuses to be defined or personified" (JMN, 5:77). "God is impersonal. .. . the Universe is his work" (JMN, 5:112). And yet, "the world was made by a mind like ours" (JMN, 5:168). "And what is God?" he continued: "We cannot say but we see clearly enough. ... he is the unspeakable, the immeasurable, the perfect—but we see plain enough in what direction it lies. . . . there [is] no bar or wall in the Soul where man the effect</page><page sequence="8">David Lyttle 63 ceases &amp; God the cause begins' (JMN, 5:229-30). "Is God a Person? No. That is a contradiction: the personality of God. A person is finite personality, is finiteness" (JMN, 5:282). By this time he used with ease the neutral pronoun "it" to refer to God, and in addition conceived God and man to be two aspects of one continuum of Being, not a distinct cause and a distinct effect. By the summer of 1836, he had formulated the memorable theme that God creates nature through the individual: "The self of self creates the world through you, &amp; organizations like you. The Universal Central Soul comes to the surface in my body" (JMN, 5:187).10 In 1837 he confirmed his motif of identity, noting that "a certain wandering light comes to me which I instantly perceive to be the Cause ot Causes. It transcends all proving. It is itselt the ground or being; and I see that it is not one &amp; I another, but this is the life of my life. That is one fact, then; that in certain moments I have known that I existed directly from God, and am, as it were, his organ. And in my ultimate consciousness [mind] Am He" (JMN, 5:337). In 1838 he delivered his famous "Divinity School Address ' in which he referred to God as "impersonal," as universal laws of "love, justice, temperance" or "laws of the soul... Γthat 1 execute themselves, [andl are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance" (CW, 1:79,77). He announced that "historical Christianity . . . dwells, with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus," and said sternly that "the soul knows no persons" (CW, 1:82)." In that same year he made the following complex and apparently contradictory statements in his journal: "Consciousness is God.... I deny Personality to God because it is too little not too much. Life, personal life is faint &amp; cold to the energy of God." "How little we know of God. . . . Yourself which is the self of all. ... I proceed from God" (JMN, 5: 467-68, 498-99). He now envisioned God to be "conscious" but without "personality," that he and God are "the self of all" but that nevertheless he "proceeds" from God. In his journal he repeatedly went over the logical implications of combining his theme of the identity of God and man with the idea that God is unconscious. Since he himself was conscious, he could not conceive of an identity of God and man when he held that God is also conscious. Would not the fact that each was conscious mean that each was a distinct and separate entity? Furthermore, he had committed himself to the idea that God is impersonal. Since he evidently meant by this that God is not a finite entity, not an individual, he could not have held also that God is conscious, for only individuals are conscious; consciousness is not a general or universal state of being, like stone, water, and color.12 At any rate, the idea that deity might be unconscious, although running strongly against his religious heritage of theism (as did the idea that God is impersonal) became a considered option for him. In fact, Emerson probably began to consider in depth the notion that God is unconscious during his first journey abroad, especially when he met</page><page sequence="9">64 The Concord Saunterer Thomas Carlyle who "claimed absolute sovereignty of the unconscious."13 Furthermore, many statements in Emerson's early sermons and essays could have easily accommodated such a conceptual shift.14 For examples: In "The Over-Soul" he informs us that "man is a stream whose source is hidden" (CW, 2:159); that God is "impersonal"; that the "private will" is overpowered by "unconscious nower." His metaphor of subjective idealism in Nature can be adapted to the idea that the source of creation is located in the unconscious: The divine spirit "does not act upon us from without, that is, in space and time, but spiritually, or through ourselves." However, just a few sentences later in Nature, he wrote that nature is a projection of God in the unconscious, that it is "a present expositor of the divine mind" (CW. 1:38-39), statements which do not necessarily conflict with each other but which certainly indicate the indecisive complexity of his meditations on the theme of identity of God and man, and on what he called the "double consciousness" (see note 18). In the same year that he delivered his "Divinity School Address," Emerson noted in his journal that "to represent him [God] as an individual is to shut him out of my consciousness" (JMN, 5:457). Precisely so. He wanted to conceive "God" to be in himself, or rather, himself to be in God; or rather, he wanted to conceive "God" (the Universal) and himself (an individual) to be one Being. And he gradually came to realize that the only way to conceive of such an identity is to conceive God and himself to be, not two conscious exclusive entities, but God to be the unconscious ("hidden") dynamic of Being and he, himself, the consciousness of Being (and "nature," the dramatic dream of Being). Along these lines he attempted, also in 1838, to correlate the idea that God is unconscious with the idea of "process": "In strict speech it seems fittest to say, I Become rather than I am. I am a Becoming. So do I less sever or divide the One" (JMN, 5:468). This statement gives the impression that he was considering that all parts of the triadic scenario—God, man, and nature—are in process. Moreover, his growing concern with the modern theory of evolution went hand in hand with his increasing references to the unconscious. The philosopher Lancelot Law Whvte writes that in the nineteenth-centurv "the development of evolutionary ideas . . . coincided closely with the progressive recognition of unconscious mental processes." For Schelling, "unconscious nature is potential mind, intelligence in course of development.... Consciousness is a secondary phenomenon due to the conflict of subject and object. A single unconscious formative energy underlies everything and displays a movement toward consciousness.'"5 Although Emerson wrote at this time: "Do not teach me out of Leibniz or Schelling, &amp; I shall find it all myself' (JMN, 7:13), he was certainly working with themes of German philosophy when he was attempting to integrate into his philosophic idealism the ideas of God, of the unconscious, and of the theory of evolution.</page><page sequence="10">David Lyttle 65 By the early forties the hypothesis that God is not conscious seems to have become a sustained option for him. In his lecture, "Doctrine of the Soul" ( 1840), he stated that "the whole tendency of our time is in the submission it enjoins to the Unconscious and Infinite".1" His theistic critics had attacked his idea that deity is impersonal; now they seem to have been thoroughly alarmed by his theory that deity is also unconscious. In response, he wrote: The objector replies that to represent the Divine Being as an unconscious somewhat, is abhorrent. . . . But the unconsciousness we spake of was merely relative to us; we speak, we act from we know not what higher principle, and we describe its circumambient quality by confessing the subjection of our perception to it. . . . But in saying this, we predicate nothing of its consciousness or unconsciousness in relation to itself. We see at once that we have no language subtle enough for distinctions in that inaccessible region.... We cannot say, God is self conscious, or not self-conscious" (JMN, 7:344; 1839-40). By this statement he seems to have made a defensive move into mystery to pacify his critics, if not himself. For one thing, he reverted to the meaning of the term "unconscious" in his earlv essays: due to man's limited knowledge, man is "unconscious" of the nature of God. However he hedged even that position when he referred to "the Divine Being" with the neutral pronoun "it." If the Divine Being is an "it," it can be neither personal nor conscious. In short, the quoted passage is not helpful in determining his private opinion about the nature of God but an excellent example of how he modified his radical speculations to retain his orthodox audiences.17 Emerson's apparent position in the above passage that man is incapable of knowing whether or not God is self-conscious or even conscious may seem contrary to his identity philosophy. However, he wrote in a journal entry dated soon after this passage that "the consciousness in each is a sliding scale which identifies us at pleasure with the first cause &amp; with the coarsest phenomena," thus indicating that he held implicitly to his identity theory of a sustained continuum of mind of God and man (JMN, 7:429) in spite of his misleading public stance that we cannot know, at least in conceptual terms of the Understanding, the essential nature of God.18 The critic, at this point, might understandably throw up his hands and close his inquiry into Emerson's struggle to define deity and his theory of identity. If he does, he disregards Emerson's continued and (to this critic) engaging but impossible efforts to blend into a coherent philosophy his subliminal loyalty to the personal God of his heritage, his mystical experience as a "transparent eyeball," his increasing realization that the subjective "I" is the ultimate reference</page><page sequence="11">66 The Concord Saunterer point of reality, the advances of contemporaneous scientific theories, especially that of evolution, and the theory that the spiritual ground of Being is impersonal and unconscious. The Death of Waldo and Dark Speculations about God In the early forties, Emerson affirmed once more his monistic theme of identity: "There is none but God only" (JMN, 12:507), and asked: "Is God conscious"!?! (JMN, 12:496), and then iotted down: "Conscious &amp; unconscious of God" (JMN, 12:523). These statements imply that he was theorizing that Being consists in the conscious individual and the unconscious Universal. Finally, despairing of defining God, he reaffirmed his identity as deity, vowing that whatever God may be, "I sit with the Cause grim or glad" (JMN, 12:524). He hesitated to commit himself to the proposition that God is not conscious as well as impersonal, but the direction of his meditations indicates that he now steadily considered this very likely indeed. In 1841 he referred in his journal, we have seen, to the sliding scale of consciousness, and wrote also that the "Heart affirms I am of the Maker not of the Made" (JMN, 7:429). Then, in "The Method of Nature" (1841), he made an abrupt statement that seems to reveal a fundamental change in his thinking about the nature of God and man: The fact of facts is the termination of the world in man. This appears to be the last victory of intelligence. The universal does not attract us until housed in an individual. Who heeds the waste abyss of possibility? The ocean is everywhere the same, but it has no character until seen with the shore or the ship. ... So must we admire in man, the form of the formless, the concentration of the vast, the house of reason, the cave of memory The great Pan of old, who was clothed in a leopard skin to signify the beautiful variety of things . . . was but the representative of thee, O rich and various Man! (CW, 1:127). In the phrase the waste abyss of possibility" Emerson was surely referring to God, for the ocean was one of his major symbols for the Over-Soul. And by the term "waste" he obviously meant not only vast but formless, without character, unless "housed in the individual," the individual who is "the house of reason, the cave of memory," the terminal event so far in evolutionary development. God, the Universal, now seemed to him not even structured until it is incarnated in man. If nature needs the individual to make sense, so now does God. The</page><page sequence="12">David Lyttle 67 Universal is mere "possibility" of power until conscious individuals actualize it through disciplined imagination. Also in 1841 Emerson complained about the conflict between being and becoming: "I resent this intrusion of alterity. That which is done, &amp; that which does, is somehow, I know not how, part of me. The Unconscious works with the conscious" (JMN, 8:10). By the term "Unconscious" he must have been referring to deity, not only because he capitalized the term but because the individual is manifestly conscious. Then on 27 January 1842, just when he was equating the unconscious with deity, and deity with formlessness and "waste of possibility," Waldo died. Emerson was "anguished" and "changed by sorrow."19 In denial he clung in memory to the child's living presence, reminiscing over and over about Waldo playing around the house and doing his little chores. The child's absence was everywhere. "If I go down to the bottom of the garden," he whispered to himself, "it seems as if some one had fallen into the brook." "The wisest knows nothing" (JMN, 8:165). Later, in April in a cryptic journal entry he jotted down: "It is the will of God" (JMN,, 8:172). The "will of God"? Did he hunger for a moment, as he had when Ellen died, for faith in a personal God?20 But what now was the will of God for him but the characterless energy of the impersonal unconscious, from which no mercy or compensation could be expected, and of which the Understanding could have no understanding? On 4 February he wrote to Caroline S turéis: "Must every experience—those that promise to be dearest &amp; most penetrative,—only kiss my cheek like the wind &amp; pass away? I think of Ixion &amp; Tantalus &amp; Kehenna. Dear Boy too precious &amp; unique a creation to be huddled aside into the waste &amp; prodigality of things !"21 As the finite consciousness of the infinite impersonal, Emerson was left alone with his loss. "We thrive by casualties he observed in Experience (CW, 3:39); and exclaimed in 1859 about "the joy which will not let me sit in my chair, which brings me bolt upright to my feet, &amp; sends me striding around my room, like a tiger in his cage, and I cannot have composure &amp; concentration enough even to set down in English words the thought which thrills me—is not that joy a certificate of the elevation? ... &amp; consoles all suffering?" (JMN, 14:308). As he had after the deaths of Ellen and his brother Charles, he surged back in compensation for disaster by obliterating sorrow in creative work, jeering, a few months later in answer to Samson Reed's chatter about the supernatural: "Other world, . . . there is no other world; here or nowhere is the whole fact." "He would have devils, objective devils. [But] that pure malignity exists, is an absurd proposition.... All my concern is with the subjective truth ... not at all with the object" (Italics mine). "Every consciousness repeats mine and is a sliding scale from Deity to Dust" (JMN, 8:182-83). "The present moment is all; the Soul is God"(JMN, 8:188).</page><page sequence="13">68 The Concord Saunterer Once more Emerson had his way. Waldo's death like Ellen's, like vast space, infinite time, like all intimidating objects and events, threw him back on his own resources, on the subjective "I," "the Soul [that] is God," that immense affirmative underneath appearances, that eternal reality which "is alive."22 Waldo's death was the ultimate test of his philosophy of identity, a test which he passed with furious flying colors. He proved to himself once again that whatever compensations were to be had for tragedy were given to himself by himself alone, according to the laws and powers of "the nature of things." In "Compensation" he had written: "Do the thing, and you shall have the power: but they who do not the thing have not the power," and referred to "the great Night or shade, on which, as a background, the living universe paints itself forth" (CW, 2:67, 70).23 Even so, he found that painting a new universe on the background of "the great Night" without his son was not easy. He admitted two months after Waldo's death: "I comprehend nothing of this fact but its bitterness. Explanation I have none, consolation none that rises out of the fact itself, only diversion, only oblivion of this &amp; pursuit of new objects" (JMN, 8:205). How could he, positing an impersonal unconscious deity of which he was the sensitive consciousness and rejecting all formal religious support for the mourner, have been more thrown on his own inner resources? Soon after this he wrote his stunning journal passage "I am Defeated all the time; yet to Victory I am born," a passage hardly simplistic and very sobering.24 Subsequently he attacked prayer as childish, "absurd &amp; ridiculous" (JMN, 8:281), thereby denying that God is a person, and, claimed that "the man, the God is awakening" (JMN, 8:417). In 1843 Emerson wrote the following journal entry certainly expressive of his pessimistic outlook on nature and its origin; later, he transposed it in "Experience": "Life has no memory. That which proceeds in succession might be remembered, but that which is coexistent, or ejaculated from a deeper cause as yet far from becoming conscious, knows not its own tendency" (JMN, 8:350; CW, 3:40-41). There is no doubt that at this time he seriously contemplated the idea that the "deeper cause" is impersonal and unconscious, perhaps even blind. Stephen Whicher writes about this passage and Emerson's inclination to designate deity as unconscious: This ... tendency in his thought... responded to his readings in Oriental, particularly Buddhist, literature, perhaps also, as Gray suggests, to echoes reaching him of Schelling's Identity philosophy The force of that influence [of Buddhism] was to cut under the lingering anthropomorphism of his deity, and the deity's too close association with the supposed benevolence</page><page sequence="14">David Lyttle 69 of nature, and to suggest instead an unknown, unnameable One behind appearances, a substance older and deeper than mind and matter, indifferent to all human values, the identity of all things yet identical with nothing.25 But Whicher goes too far. Emerson never made such a decisive break with his earlier thinking; he never seriously believed, as Whicher seems to imply, that the ground of Being is not identical with the individual; he never came to believe in a Une behind appearances, a Une which is an Uther than he. In tact, right after the above quoted passage from "Experience" he stated (did Whicher notice?) that "there is that in us which changes not, and which ranks all sensations and states of mind. The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his body," a metaphor, once again, that supports his theory of identity (CW, 3:42). In 1844 Emerson charged God with insensitivity, writing to Margaret Fuller, with harsh facetiousness: I have had no experiences no progress to put me into better intelligence with my calamity [Waldo's death] than when it was new.... Ί am not satisfied.'... But the inarticulateness of the Supreme Power how can we insatiate hearers perceivers &amp; thinkers ever reconcile ourselves unto? It deals all too highly with us low-levelled &amp;- weaponed men. Does the Power labor, as men do, with the impossibility of perfect explication, that always the hurt is one of one kind &amp; the compensation of another? My divine temple which all angels seemed to love to build &amp; which was shattered in a night, I can never rebuild."26 However much Emerson felt that he was compensated for Waldo's death by greater creativity, it is not surprising that he was bitter about the trade-off. But given the state of his philosophy at this time, how could he have expected anything else from "the nature of things"? And would a personal God have been any more articulate? Would he or she have treated him any better? At the least, he could curse fate without fear of jealous reprisal. In 1844-45, he placed in his journal the following disturbing and fascinating entry: Who cares how madly the early savages fight [,] who sides with one or another: their rage is organic and has its animal sweetness... Onward &amp; onward that ever going progression. That breathless haste what god can tell us whither? Who cares for the crimes of the past, for oppressing whites or oppressed</page><page sequence="15">70 The Concord Saunterer blacks, any more than for bad dreams? These fangs &amp; eaters &amp; food are all in the harmony of nature: &amp; there too is the germ forever protected, unfolding, gigantic leaf after leaf, a newer flower, a richer fruit every period. Yet its next is not to be guessed. It will only save what is worth saving &amp; it saves not by compassion but by power. It saves men through themselves. It appoints no police to guard the lion but his teeth &amp; claws. . . .1 say to you, you must save yourself, black or white, man or woman. Other help is none (JMN, 9:124 25).27 The beneficent creation of Emerson s youth had withered before the law of the wild. Now he sees finite man in objective time hurled along by blind, impersonal force, an "It," which rules not by compassion but by brute force. Those who are powerful are those who survive. And who knows where the whole affair is going? This is an extremely naturalistic statement lightyears away from his beautiful passages in Nature, from his philosophic idealism, and from his doctrine of melioration. And one cannot help speculating about how he would have applied his theory of correspondence to the above statement. Had the implications of his theory caught up to him with vengeance? Did he ever clearly ask himself: Is this nature which he now envisions, this nature alive with "sweet" animal ferocity, red in tooth and claw, swarming with those who are powerful, haunted with the deaths of dear ones, ominous with impending war—is this nature the creation of a tyrannical personal deity or the product of meaningless matter unobligated to man or, most of all, is this nature the symbolic expression of the "infinitude" of man?28 But this is not the whole story. The above passage in its entirety is a strange emulsion of subjective and objective metaphors, a war of cosmic perspectives expressing Emerson's turmoil. Embedded in the descriptions of vast impersonal forces moving through absolute space and time, is an organic metaphor of prehistoric dimension, suggesting centrality and projection. For what is "the germ forever protected, unfolding, gigantic leaf after leaf, a new flower, a richer fruit, every year, but an image of the center, of an immense tropical plant unfolding from its dark opaque eye, the leaves and fruits of a violent world in which men are saved only "through themselves"? This cosmic image, with its primitive animality, seems to be a power-play of Emerson's subjective idealism against the linear onrush of deterministic naturalism. This image defines the latent ferocity of centrality, and suggests the savagery and lawless dangers of the center's loneliness, the possibilities of which are always present in Emerson. For "the germ" unfolding, in this interpretation, is the subject, even Emerson himself, which powers the object with the "sweetness" of animal vitality.</page><page sequence="16">David Lyttle 71 Further, this passage in general recalls the ambiguous passage in "Self Reliance": "If I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil," the implications of which are that Emerson, when he felt it necessary, was not disinclined, even when he wrote that early essay, to repudiate, when necessary, values of humane morality in favor of sheer power. In fact, he says in that essay: "Power is, in nature, the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself' (CW, 2:40). And one remembers Nietzsche's attraction to him, and his own reserved admiration for his Aunt Mary's severe Calvinism, for Napoleon, and his statement in "Experience" of his full recognition that "subjectivity" is at once the reason for our divine self-trust and uui ueuci mai we eau uu iiu wiuug. winy nie eumpiex mieiisny υι nie passage expresses a change in his philosophy. Emerson read Sendling again, and Schelling strengthened his feeling that the ground of Being is dynamic and unconscious. He then speculated that "all philosophy begins from Nox &amp; Chaos, the Ground or Abyss which Schelling so celebrates, ... a certain abyss of reliance &amp; fortitude on which to fall back, when worst comes to worst" (JMN, 9:223).29 He subsequently comments that "there must be the Abyss, Nox, &amp; Chaos out of which all come, &amp; they must never be far off' (JMN, 9:325). In his various efforts, from the thirties to the fifties, to describe the ground of Being, Emerson moved from the visionary mind in Nature , to the "lap of immense intelligence" in "Self-Reliance" (CW, 2:37), to "the aboriginal abyss of real Being,.. .the vast affirmative, excluding negation" in "Compensation," to the "bleak rocks" of solitude of which "God [is] the native" in "Experience" (CW, 3:46); to the "abyss of reliance &amp; fortitude" on which to fall back, when worst comes to worst." Now we are told that we originate in and draw life from "Nox &amp; Chaos." In 1854 he made a dramatic statement that reverts to his period of despondency in 1844 (and perhaps reflects his anticipatory horror, but not his disapproval, of the impending Civil War): "The existence of evil &amp; malignant men does not depend on themselves or on men, it indicates the virulence that still remains uncured in the universe, uncured &amp; corrupting &amp; hurling out these pestilent rats &amp; tigers, and men rat-like &amp; wolf-like.... The mass are animal, in a state of pupilage, &amp; nearer the chimpanzee. We are used as brute atoms, until we think" (JMN, 13:298, 302). Here he speculates that evil is not the absence of good or the result of the individual will, but the consequence if not of "objective devils" then (as Whicher suggests) of the incomplete process of the ongoing evolution of "the Whole." Again he implies that the origin of rationality in the universe is primarily located in individuals who "think" rather than in the unconscious Universal. How enduringly convinced Emerson was of the truth of the above negative "naturalistic" passages (most of which in his work are pointed out) is debatable, but obviously, he was grievously afflicted by this kind of thinking</page><page sequence="17">72 The Concord Saunterer especially during the early and mid-forties; it surely infected his affirmative philosophy. He had vowed to himself right after Waldo's death: "Stick to thy affirming, how faint &amp; feeble so ever. A poet is an affirmer. Such loud &amp; manifold denial as certain chemists, astronomers, &amp; geologists make imposes on me" (JMN, 8:174). And he had written a little earlier in "The Poet": "For the world is not painted or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe" (CW, 3:5); that is, beauty is not superimposed on nature by the sense perceptions of man, nor does the beauty in nature herald supernatural beauty; rather, beauty is the verv essence of Beine here and now. And vet when one reads Emerson's disillusioned journal entries and other prose passages quoted in this essay, he sharply realizes how serious was Emerson's struggle with the negative. "The Poet," like other set pieces written during these years, seems in some ways a strategic tour de force, like a transcendental mush dished out to expectant audiences.30 Jonathan Bishop observes that the Emerson of middle age "becomes the preacher of a myth about the Soul, instead of a prophet of the Soul itself."31 A subtle and complex example of Emerson the preacher is a passage in "The Young American" ( 1844), written after the death of his son: There is a sublime and friendly Destiny by which the human race is guided,—the race never dying, the individual never soared.—to results affecting masses and ases. Men are narrow and selfish, but the Genius, or Destiny, is not narrow, but beneficent. . . . This Genius, or Destiny, is of the sternest administration, though rumors exist of its secret tenderness. It may be styled a cruel kindness, serving the whole even to the ruin of the member,... reserving all profits to the community, without dividend to individuals. Its law is, vou shall have every thing as a member, nothing to yourself.... Nature thus saves and uses, laboring for the general, that we poor particulars are so crushed and straitened [sic], and find it so hard to live. . . . Our condition is like that of the poor wolves: if one of the flock wound himself, or so much as limp, the rest eat him up incontinently" (CW, 1:230-31). In this passage, Emerson informs us that the individual is not a powerful modifier of "Destiny," but a finite, expendable, even vicious, entity; and that "sublime and friendly Destiny," although it fosters a meliorative tendency of the race in general, is hardly "friendly" to the individual. His youthful optimism about the ability of the individual to build his own world according to "the pure idea" in his mind had apparently been lost to common sense in common tragic experience, if not to the dark implications of Darwinian theory.</page><page sequence="18">David Lyttle 73 Another example of the public-preacher Emerson is ajournai entry two years later, in 1846: "First; the perception of one polarity impressed on all the universe, &amp; on all the particles: As the whole has its law, so each has its genius. . . . Trust that the Tendency of the Whole is the good of the Individual, is the Universal of faith. ... I stipulate for no private good. If truth live, I live; if justice live, I live. Put men to death by principles, &amp; they will not grumble.... Do not truck for your private immortality. If immortality is best, you shall be immortal" (JMN , 9:403). This passage and the previous one are filled with echoes of earlier preoccupations. Emerson was still holding to his themes of melioration, of genius, of the uniqueness and universality of each individual. and to his doubt about personal immortality. But now his perspective is limited to the ordinary, to the flat scene of the objective. He makes a conventional distinction between "the Individual" (the Soul), and "men" (the body), and means simply that an individual does not grumble when he saves his immortal soul by sacrificing his material body to spiritual principles. And another example: In 1867 Emerson remarked to the Free Religious Association (which he helped found): "It is only by good works ... that worship finds expression."32 Two years later, he wrote: "The first simple foundation of my belief, that the Author of Nature has not left himself without a witness in any sane mind: that the moral sentiment speaks to every man the law after which the Universe was made; . . . that there is a force always at work to make the best better and the worst good... The health and integrity of man is self-respect.... Every believer holds a different creed" ( W, 11:486-88). There is no question that in his later years, Emerson, the humanitarian preacher, dominated Emerson, the solitary mystic. But Stephen Whicher, counterbalancing Bishop, is also correct when he says that always beyond Emerson's "humanism lies his superhumanism Beyond the region of ethics and economy and the conduct of life, lies the lonely world of the one Life, the onward flow of the eternal Energy and the immutable laws it creates and obeys."33 Neither the young private Emerson nor the elder public Emerson was fundamentally a humanist. He never believed that man is the measure; he never humanized God; he divinized the human; he was not a moralist of the picayune. This essential Emerson, this genius of superhumanism, remained throughout the last part of his life hidden under smiles of geniality, but suddenly breaking forth in "Perpetual Forces" (1862): "The last revelation of intellect and of sentiment is that in a manner it severs the man from all other men; makes known to him that the spiritual powers are sufficient to him if no other being existed; that he is to deal absolutely in the world, as if he alone were a system and a state, and though all should perish could make all anew" (W, 10:83). In this incredible statement of subjective idealism, Emerson threw to the wind all his notes and lectures on the nature of God, on culture, on scientific</page><page sequence="19">74 The Concord Saunterer evolution, and returned to his old, audacious ahistoncal genius of Nature and "Self-Reliance": "I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me" (CW, 2:30). "Since the Soul of things is in thee/Thou needest nothing out of thee" he affirmed of himself after Ellen died (JMN, 3:292). Always for him there was more than society and nature; there was at last (only) himself and all that "himself' meant; always his identity as the universal mind; always as the central "I" (that living reality beneath appearances) observing now his body in old age drifting towards death, the whole dream of nature receding, those hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of those trees, the armies of his friends crying out, the face of that beautiful boy. And yet there is something strident about this incredible statement (which, by the way, appears to have been interjected between mild passages concerning "celestial thoughts" and men working together within "a system of mutual aid, all for each and each for all") that suggests a radical idealism in an increasingly materialistic age, crystallizing into dogma. Charles Eliot Norton complained in 1873 that Emerson's "optimistic philosophy" had "hardened into a creed . . . closing the avenues of truth. ... He can accept nothing as fact that tells against his dogma.... To him this is the best of all possible worlds.... He refuses to believe in disorder or evil. . . . Good is absolute, evil but good in the making."34 Elizabeth Peabody asked Emerson: "Is there not something in God corresponding to and justifying this human sensibility," and he answered emphatically, "No!"35 This exchange took place in 1836 at the same time that he was celebrating his mystical experience in Nature and developing his theory of identity. Thus even at this early date he had concluded that "the infinitude of the private man" is beyond "human sensibility." And since he retained his theory of correspondence throughout his later years, in which nature is symbolic of the soul, the question must arise again: Did he come to believe that the infinitude of the "private" mind is manifested as inhumane violence in nature as well as sublime and creative beauty? We have seen that he thought "absurd" the idea "that pure malignity exists." But how could he explain natural evils, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, disease, deaths of beloved ones? Were they merely absences of good? And how about his own inevitable death?36 Emerson created his monistic philosophy of the identity of God and man in part to support his conviction that "here or nowhere is the whole fact," that answers to the great questions of life and death are neither in some supernatural realm, nor in the past, nor in the future, nor in deep space, nor in the hearts or minds 01 some privileged tew, but here, now, as universal intuitions or each individual. In Nature (1836) he had assured his audience that "undoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable," and had exclaimed, "I see all" (CW, 1:7,10).</page><page sequence="20">David Lyttle 75 Yet at the same time, in "Experience" (1844), after the the death of Waldo had taught him the true gravity of natural evil, he made the brave claim "that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature." But he also said that he grieved that this claim was trae (CW 3:29)—hence, incidently, accepting the psychology but dismissing with deep regret the theology of the Christian cross. Sixteen years later in "Fate" ( 1860) he proposed that "if evil is good in the making, ... if calamities, oppositions, and weights are wings and means,—we are reconciled" (W, 6:35). However, the subjunctive mood of this proposition reveals his real feeling, namely, that such an attempt by the Understanding to give human meaning to natural evils was as dissatisfying as are similar ones by the orthodox: it was too rational, too shallow, to reconcile him to the anguished emptiness of the natural evils he had known. Even as the consciousness of God he had to admit that he could not "see all," that he could not read the full nature of (his) infinitude any more than the Calvinists could read the inscrutable will of God. During his last years, he retreated into the moral business of political and social action. But in moods of solitude he must have considered how his poetic vision in Nature of man's divinity had changed into his final declaration that "the spiritual powers are sufficient to him if no other being existed"—all the while remembering Ellen, Charles, and Waldo; all the while denying that this world was not the best of all possible worlds; assuming true (as he had since Nature ) that "there is no doctrine of the Reason which will bear to be taught by the Understanding" (CW 1:81); willing true to be forever.

Jean Grondin argues that Leibnitz and Fichte (not Descartes or Kant) are the true predecessors of the thinkers who held that the "I" is "the ultimate reference point of reality" (See his essay, "Leibniz and Fichte," in Fichte: Historical Contexts/Contemporary Controversies, ed. Daniel Breazeale and Tom Rockmore [Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1994], 181). It is obvious that philosophies like Emerson's,</page><page sequence="21">76 The Concord Saunterer which designate the "I" as essential reality are antithetical to "the recent trend of deconstructivism" that claims that "the I or the human subject [is] a mere invention, a fiction typical of the Enlightenment and its stress on the autonomy of the human self' (Grondin, in Fichte: Historical Contexts/Contemporary Controversies, 181). 4 The Complete Sermons of Ralph Waldo Emerson. 4 vols.

See Channing's sermon "Father of Spirits," published for the first time in my book, Studies in Religion in Early American Literature (New York: University Press of America, 1983), 125-141. Emerson very likely heard Channing deliver this sermon in 1823. In January, 1842, both Emerson's five year old son, Waldo, and Henry Thoreau's older brother, John, died. For the sake of commiseration, Emerson may have shown Thoreau his own sermon entitled "Consolation for the Mourner." Thoreau wrote in his journal on 19 February 1842: "The death of friends should inspire us as much as their lives. If they are great and rich enough, they will leave consolation to the mourners before the expenses of their funerals" (The Journal of Henry D. Thoreau. Edited by Bradford Torrey and Francis H.Allen. 1905; [rpt. New York: Dover, 1962],1:98). 5 Ralph L. Rusk, ed. The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson. 6 vols.

Hodder, Emerson '5 Rhetoric of Revelation (University Park, Penn: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989), especially pages 56-68, for a fine discussion about how the death of Ellen helped Emerson consolidate his premise of "the God within." 7 See my essay, ' Emerson s Transcendental Individualism, ' The Concord Saunterer, New Series,Volume 3 (Fall, 1995), 92-93. Emerson wrote in "Manners": "Let the incommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence" (CW, 3:80). See David Robinson, Apostle of Culture, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982), 133, for a discussion about Emerson's rejection of the idea of God as a person. 8 Emerson meant by the term "law," immanent, universal spiritual laws and, later in his philosophic development, universal laws of nature corresponding to spiritual laws. See William Rossi's important essay, "Emerson, Nature, and Natural Science" in A Historical Guide to Ralph Waldo Emerson [New York: Oxford University Press, 2000], especially 122-124. For some examples Emerson wrote: "Underneath all Appearances &amp; causing all appearances are certain eternal Laws which we call the Nature of Things" (JMN, 5:222). In "The American Scholar"</page><page sequence="22">David Lyttle 77 he stated: "Help must come from the bosom alone. ... If there be one lesson more than another which should pierce his [the scholar's] ear, it is, The world is nothing, the man is all; in yourself is the law of all nature. ... in yourself slumbers the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all; it is for you to dare all" (CW, 1:69). He held that moral laws take priority over the idea of a personal God: "The moral sentiments are immutable. Was there ever a moment in your life when you doubted the existence of the Divine Person? Yes. Was there ever a moment in your life when you doubted the duty of speaking the truth? No. Then is one mutable, the other immutable" (JMN, 5:28; 1837). 9 For a consideration of Emerson's concept of "the universal mind" see Ronald A. Bosco's persuasive essay, "The 'Somewhat Spheral and Infinite' in Every Man: Emerson's Theory of Biography" in Emersonian Circles: Essays in Honor of Joel Myerson, ed. by Wesley T. Mott and Robert E. Burkholder (New York:University of Rochester Press, 1997), especially 82-92. Emerson recorded a deeply religious vision: I was born &amp; came into the world to deliver the self of myself to the Universe from the Universe [the Universal].... &amp; then immerge [sic] again into the holy silence &amp; eternity, out of which as a man I arose. God is rich &amp; many more men than I, he harbors in his bosom.... When I wish, it is permitted me to say, these hands, this body, this history of Waldo Emerson are profane &amp; wearisome, but I, I descend not to mix myself with that or with any man. Above his life, above all creatures I flow down forever a sea of benefit into races of individuals. Nor can the stream ever roll backward or the sin or death of a man taint the immutable energy which distributes itself into men as the sun into rays or the sea into drops (JMN, 7:435). Emerson wrote in Nature: "The Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through us" (CW, 1:38). About this metaphor, B. L Packer writes that it "seems to suggest that natural phenomena are somehow being extruded through us like toothpaste—or, as Burke prefers to put it, like offal," (Emerson's Fall, [New York: Continuum, 1982], 58). But this theme is one of Emerson's most daring metaphors for his "organic" philosophy. Moreover, the theme of the subject creating the object is at the heart of much Romantic philosophy of the nineteenth century. Grondin points out that for both Leibnitz and Fichte the "I" is "a starting point that will unravel within itself the realm of alterity" (Fichte: Historical Contexts/Contemporary Controversies, 185). See my essay, "The World is a Divine Dream": Emerson's Subjective Idealism," The Concord Saunterer, New Series, Volume 5 (Fall, 1997), 93-110.</page><page sequence="23">78 The Concord Saunterer 11 One problem in interpreting Emerson to mean that the Over-Soul is purposeful energy in nature, or moral laws, or love, or "Beautiful Necessity," and so forth, is that these are attributes or qualities of mind, not mind itself, a distinction Emerson himself often did not make. Henry Ware, Jr., in his "Divinity School Address," complained that Emerson's position was not logical in that "veracity, justice, love ... are qualities of being; and like all qualities have no actual existence [ apart from] the substances in which they inhere" (Quoted in Kenneth Walter Cameron, "Henry Ware's 'Divinity School Address': A Reply to Emerson,"' American Transcendental Quarterly 23: 86). Ware thought that such qualities belong to a person or persons, not to an impersonal It; and that to pray to qualities, attributes, principles, merely in themselves was vacuous idolatry. Cyrus Augustus Bartol many years later ( 1874) asked, doubtless having Emerson in mind: "You refuse Personality as a designation [to God]? Is there wisdom and no one wise, goodness and no one gracious, beauty and no one All-Fair?" (Quoted in On Spirit and Personality, ed. William G. Heath, Jr. (St. Paul, Minn.: John Colet Press, 1977), 103). When Emerson rejected the idea that God is a person, a separate and distinct mind from men, he did not reject the premise that fundamental reality is mind; he described "God" as impersonal mind. But is not this an illogical concept. What is an impersonal mind? How can such a mind have an "I"? How can it possess attributes or qualities that require an agent? Ware and Bartol were right. For love, wisdom, justice, purpose, to exist there must be a lover, a wise man, a judge, a goal seeker. Energy by itself is not conscious or purposeful. "Laws of the soul" do not "execute themselves," much less create themselves. One answer to the question, If "God" is impersonal, who possesses these attributes or qualities? is that individual men and women possess them. But Emerson would not have been satisfied with this answer, because he believed that these qualities are not simply human attributes, situational and relativistic. On the contrary, he assumed that they are absolute, that their origin is not temporal and spatial, "not subject to circumstance." Accordingly, for him their agent must be absolute and transcendental. But, again, he rejected the concept of a personal God and believed that "God" is impersonal. And yet an impersonal agent cannot have personal attributes or qualities. How can the impersonal be a person? Consequently, Emerson was consistent in holding that the mind of each man and woman is an agent of these absolute attributes or qualities. Hence his theory of identity in which the individual and the universal are, paradoxically, identical.</page><page sequence="24">David Lyttle 79 Moreover, in intimate and experiential terms, Jonathan Bishop adventurously remarks that in regarding Emerson the "entire Soul Nature relation can only become emotionally interesting when Soul seems to mean Self and Self means Me. We cannot take the impersonality of spirit seriously until it becomes a personal event," and that Emerson was "fully aware of this paradox, not to say pleased with it" (Emerson on the Soul [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964], 93. I thank Wesley T. Mott for pointing out this reference. See his excellent essay, "Emerson and Individualism" in A Historical Guide, 97). We may argue then (continuing our attempt to make conceptually coherent and livingly significant Emerson's thought) that for Emerson, the individual "i" (the very identity of the individual, the "i" that is you, the reader, the "i" that you cannot doubt but that you cannot conceptualize ) is in truth also the universal "I" or "God," the "ultimate reference point of reality." Thus logically, the absolute qualities of love, justice, beauty, that seem to float by themselves through the landscape of his language, do have an absolute agent. In this way we may understand Emerson's radical interiority, his deep monism of the one "I." This is what he meant by the "infinitude of the private man" (JMN, 7:342). It is no wonder that he referred to the Over-Soul as "the background of our being,... an immensity not possessed and that cannot be possessed" (CW, 2:161). M. H. Abrams observes that "Carlyle exceeded even his German forbears in the claims he made for the absolute sovereignty of the unconscious in all valid activity, whether in the literary, political, or moral domain." (The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition [New York: Norton, 1958J, 216). Carlyle wrote in Characteristics (1831): The fever of Skepticism [sic] must needs burn itself out, and burn out thereby the Impurities that cause it; then again will there be clearness, health. The principle of life, which now struggles painfully, in the outer, thin and barren domain of the Conscious or the Mechanical, may then withdraw into its inner sanctuaries, its abysses of mystery and miracle; withdraw deeper than ever into that domain of the Unconscious, by nature infinite and inexhaustible; and creatively work there. From that mystic region, and from that alone, all wonders, all Posies, and Religions, and Social Systems have proceeded: the like wonders, and greater and higher, lie slumbering there; and, brooded on by the spirit of the waters, will evolve themselves, and rise like exhalations from the Deep (Quoted in The Norton Anthology of English Literature·. Fifth Edition,</page><page sequence="25">80 The Concord Saunterer ed. M. H. Abrams et al, two volumes [New York:Norton, 1962], 2:962-63). See Jeffrey Steele for an elaboration of this point in the chapter, "Emerson's Myth of the Unconscious," in The Representation of the Self in the American Renaissance (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1987), 21-22. Whyte continues: "Schelling gave the earliest formulation ... of the following argument, which for minds affected by the Cartesian dualism is of crucial importance: that one organizing principle must pervade both the physical world and consciousness, but that outside our own awareness this principle is not itself conscious. This unifying principle of organization and productivity operates without awareness in the determinism of nature, and with awareness in our sense of freedom" (The Unconscious Before Freud_ [New York: Doubleday, 1962], 44, 116, 117). The Early Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Edited by Stephen E. Whicher, et al. 3 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.; Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1959, 1964, 1972), 3:10. It would be very surprising if Emerson and Thoreau, at this time, had not discussed the concept of deity as unconscious. Thoreau wrote in 1840: "The unconsciousness of man is the consciousness of God, the end of the world." In 1842, he asked: "Why, God, did you include me in your great scheme? Will you not make me a partner at last? Did it need there should be a conscious material?" (The Journal of Henry D. Thoreau, 1:48; 1:100). I have a faint recollection that Emerson turned this journal entry into public statement, but if he did, I cannot now locate it. In "Experience (1841) Emerson gave this image of the sliding scale its final form: "The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his body" (CW, 3:42). The critic may claim that Emerson, in this image, did not conceive the individual and the Universal to be one identity, because Emerson said "with the First Cause," not as the First Cause. But Emerson also said "with the body," not as the body. Will the critic then claim that Emerson held that the individual is neither God nor the body, but floating somewhere in between? In fact, this is what he probably had in mind. He thought that the focus of "the consciousness" floats, as it were, up and down on the scale of mind, between the individual and universal poles of perspective. In the low objective perspective of the "Understanding" an individual knows himself to be a person distinct and separate from all other persons, a minute, awe struck and humble entity in a vast and meaningless universe of time</page><page sequence="26">David Lyttle 81 and space; this is the ordinary perspective people have of the actual world. In contrast, in the high subjective perspective of transcendental "Reason," the individual knows himself to be the individual/Universal, the First Cause of the apparent universe of which he is the subjective center, the origin and core of all value. ("Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world is very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all its pride." ["Spiritual Laws,"CW 2:86]). Perspective is essential to understanding where Emerson is coming from in any particular passage. Louisa May Alcott recorded that when a young child she "was sent to inquire for little Waldo, then lying very ill. His father came to me, so worn with watching and changed by sorrow, that I was startled, and could only stammer out my message. 'Child, he is dead!' was his answer. Then the door closed" (Quoted by George Edward Woodbury in Ralph Waldo Emerson [New York:Macmillan, 1907], 81). Emerson advised in "Self-Reliance": "In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee" (CW, 2:33). The ambience of theism, free of the shackles of ritual and dogma, faded in and out of Emerson's imagination. Rusk, Letters 3:9-10. In "Threnody, ' his elegy to his son, Emerson wrote: "If I repine,/And seeing rashly torn and moved/ Not what I made, but what I loved,/ Grow early old with grief that thou/Must to the wastes of Nature go." Emerson described his philosophy in the following wonderful metaphor, based on his ocean crossings: Here we drift, like a white sail across the wild ocean, now bright on the wave, now darkling in the trough of the sea;— but from what port did we sail? Who knows? Or to what port are we bound? Who knows? There is no one to tell us but such poor weather-tossed mariners as ourselves, whom we speak as we pass, or who have hoisted some signal, or floated to us some letter in a bottle from far. But what know they more than we? They also found themselves on this wondrous sea. No; from the older sailors, nothing. Over all their speaking trumpets, the gray sea and the loud winds answer, Not in us; not in Time. Where then but in Ourselves. . . . Underneath all these appearances, lies that which is, that which lives, that which causes. This ever renewing generation of appearances rests on a reality, and a reality that is alive (CW, 1:182; from the "Introductory Lecture" in the series "Lecture on the Times" (1841-1842).</page><page sequence="27">82 The Concord Saunterer Packer quotes James M. Cox who said that "there is a sense in which Emerson literally feeds off the death around him," and then says that Cox "points out the connection between Ellen's death and the influx of imaginative energy that follows, between the death of Charles and the 'strong assertion' of NaturePacker is surely correct when she goes on to explain these influxes of energy to be defensive measures of the ego: "if Emerson had not developed such defenses very early on in life, it is hard to see how he could have survived as a man, let alone a writer" (Emerson's Fall, 52). Emerson never courted suffering. The famous passage in his journal is: There ought to be no such thing as Fate. As long as we use this word, it is a sign of our impotence &amp; that we are not yet ourselves. There is now a sublime revelation in each of us which makes us so strangely aware &amp; certain of our riches that although I have never since I was born for so much as one moment expressed the truth, and although I have never heard the expression of it from any other, I know the whole is here,— the wealth of the Universe is for me. Every thing is explicable &amp; practical for me. And yet whilst I adore this ineffable life which is at my heart, it will not condescend to gossip with me, it will not announce to me any particulars of science [spiritual life], it will not enter into the details of my biography, &amp; say to me why I have a son &amp; daughters born to me, or why my son dies in his sixth year of joy. Herein then I have this latent omniscience coexistent with omnignorance. Moreover, whilst this Deity glows at the heart, &amp; by his unlimited presentiment gives me all power, I know that tomorrow will be as this day, I am a dwarf, &amp; I remain a dwarf. That is to say, I believe in Fate. As long as I am weak, I shall talk of Fate; whenever the God fills me with his fullness, I shall see the disappearance of Fate. I am Defeated all the time; yet to Victory I am born (JMN, 8:228). Stephen Ε. Whicher, Freedom and Fate: An Inner Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson (New York: A. S. Barnes, 1953), 151. Ronald A. Bosco, in his recent and informative essay, "Emerson and His Biographers" (A Historical Guide to Ralph Waldo Emerson, 278-280) clarified my own view for me by clarifying Whicher's. Once again, I differ from Whicher (and Philip L. Nicoloff, Wallace E. Williams, and John Michael) in believing that although Emerson lost the freshness and naivete of the ethical idealism of his youth, he did not desert his philosophy of the</page><page sequence="28">David Lyttle 83 identity of God and man, of the universal mind and the infinitude of the individual, regardless of how he believed that "God" is manifested in nature. He said with determination: "I sit with the Cause grim or glad" (JMN, 12:524). In my opinion, he never was, nor psychologically could ever have been, a skeptic about his religious position. His intuitive theme of identity was the foundation of his cosmic optimism. Again, see Ronald A. Bosco (in "The 'Somewhat Spheral and Infinite' in Every Man: Emerson's Theory of Biography" in Emersonian Circles, especially 92-93). Rusk, Letters, 3:238-39. Emerson incorporated these lines near the end of "Emancipation in West Indies" in his discussion of the early brutal conditions of human evolution and "the civilization of the negro." At the end of the essay he assures the reader that mankind is inevitably evolving out of these conditions and that there is a moral law that "Man is one, and . . . you cannot injure any member, without a sympathetic injury to all the members," and that "there is a blessed necessity by which the interest of men is always driving them to the right" (The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Edited by Edward Waldo Emerson. 12 vols. Centenary Edition. [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1903-4], 11:143-45, 147). Once spotted the journal passage about what is worth saving is saved not by compassion but by power, and which is embedded in the "politically correct" flat text of "Emancipation," springs out at the reader with an intensity of rhythm and metaphor that bears witness to the depth of Emerson's conviction. Sherman Paul wntes that the theory of correspondence was fundamental to Emerson, because it was "a way of seeing the universe in the light of human needs," of seeing "the universe as friendly, beneficent, lawful, and related to every part" (Emerson's Angle of Vision [Mass.:Harvard University Press, 1952], 2). This is true, but it ignores the problem of natural evil, which Emerson could not and did not try to evade. 1 September 1845, Emerson commented to J. Elliot Cabot: "This admirable Schelling, which I have never fairly engaged with until the last week. ... I delight in his steady inevitable eye" (Rusk, Letters, 3:298). The negative passages I have quoted do not contradict Gertrude Reif Hughes' premise that Emerson's "self which may be relied upon as a guide on the quest that is a quest within certainty, not a quest for certainty, is God." (Emerson's Demanding Optimism [Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 1984], 109). But they do bear upon Emerson's changing opinion about the character of fundamental reality,</page><page sequence="29">84 The Concord Saunterer and man's ability to know the depths of Being. William Rossi writes: "While his vision of physical nature changed dramatically over the course of his long life, there is reason to doubt that Emerson ever really abandoned teleology" (A Historical Guide, 120). In advising Charles Eliot Norton in 1862 about the publication of a poem (apparently by Clough) Emerson wrote: "I would not print it .... It is the saddest and sincerest of odes. It should pass privately to all souls who are as much emancipated, &amp; have learned how much history they can spare when they have been permitted a glance at the First Cause. But when it comes to the young public, it is a little rude. The affirmative part is short &amp; vague, not an offset to the negative.... Meantime, the happiness of tender souls is assailed, whilst the dearest of all traditions is taken away, &amp; nothing adequate is supplied." (Rusk, Letters 5:293). Emerson considered it his duty to protect "tender souls" from the negative, just as it was his strategy in his lectures, essays, and sermons, to protect his listeners, as much as integrity allowed, by camouflaging his own radical religious speculations with positive metaphor and conventional terminology.
