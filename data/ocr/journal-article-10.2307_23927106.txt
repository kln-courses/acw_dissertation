I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which re lations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with {Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The ques tion Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life. I. INTRODUCTION This article will use a reading of George Eliot's Middlemarch (1871-72) and some brief comments on recent research in cognitive science to show both the promise and the limits of an approach to human togetherness derived from Heidegger and Levinas and to suggest how this approach might be connected to a reading of literary texts. In her recent article in Literature and Theology, Toril Moi appealed for readings of literary texts that do not use literature simply to illustrate a pre-existing philosophical position, but instead allow the text to surprise the reader beyond what he or she knew, or thought they knew, before they encountered the work.1 Moi and Stanley Cavell, 'Worcester College, University of Oxford Worcester College, Oxford.

Eliot's 800-page novel ends by invoking 'unhistoric acts' that neither novels nor history books record: 'That things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.'3 Admittedly, this appeal beyond the written record occurs in a novel. Nevertheless, it shows Eliot's awareness of the non-literary, everyday inter actions by which humans ameliorate or worsen their shared lot, as well as her willingness to situate her efforts as a novelist amongst these quotidian inter actions without according them a special place. Characters in Middlemarch read novels, but reading is not the vehicle of their most transformative experiences, and indeed the narrator gently ironises a figure like Mr Brooke who thinks incidents in everyday life might benefit from being 'worked up' by a Fielding or a Scott (Middlemarch, 39: p. 428). The famous, programmatic statement about realism and sympathy with which Eliot interrupts her narrative in Adam Bede (1859) urges both writers and readers of novels to consider the wider interactions of which fiction is only a part, lest the creation of idealised human characters encourage the reader to tum 'a harder colder eye' 'on the real breathing men and women, who can be chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your fellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken brave justice'.4 Novels, in this view, are a technology of human interaction, one of the practices by which coexistence is managed more or less successfully. It behoves both nov elists and their readers to be mindful of the wider context of which works of fiction are but a part and not generate tools for looking on 'real breathing men and women' with a cold eye. This situated account of literature is not at odds with the approach of Moi or Cavell. In an article setting out her guiding assumptions as a critic working in the tradition of ordinary language philosophy, Moi cites, but reverses, Ricoeur's disapproval of the later Wittgenstein for whom 'language is a form of activity like eating, drinking, and sleeping'.5 It is precisely because the Wittgenstein of the Philosophical Investigations views language as an insep arable part of the things we do together as human beings that his approach is so fruitful for critics who do not want to tum their backs on everyday life. But if Cavell and Moi follow Wittgenstein in their interest in the ordinary, they also suppose that literature has a special job to do nevertheless. In Cavell's view, we are grateful to poets who articulate things we haven't managed to say</page><page sequence="3">438 BEN MORGAN ourselves and we need to watch King Lear to have our passivity and failures of acknowledgment called to account and potentially transformed.6 In a similar vein, Moi follows Beauvoir in arguing that literature is special 'because it allows us to see the world from the point of view of the other without ceasing to be ourselves'.7 In contrast, for Eliot literature does not particularly facilitate our communion with others; if anything it gets in the way of it, as Dorothea in Middlemarch discovers when she realises that viewing her husband, Mr. Casaubon, as a Pascal, Locke or Milton does not help her understand him anywhere near as well as the shock of unexpected differences of opinion does, shaking her out of the 'moral stupidity' that the world is there to serve her wishes (Middlemarch, 21: p. 243). If Eliot views the novel as only one of the tools available to people as they negotiate their interactions, thus qualifying the role which ordinary language critics attribute to literature, her approach is germane to another a facet of Moi's and Cavell's discussions: the question of otherness. Cavell and Moi alike accept the challenge of what Cavell calls 'skepticism', which is the belief, or experience, that people are fundamentally inaccessible to each other. Literature helps us deal with what Cavell calls our 'metaphysical finitude' and so abandon the vain quest to participate in each other's inner lives, which Cavell and skeptics take to be impossible, and apply ourselves to the more fruitful business of acknowledging each other's suffering.8 A novelist like Thackeray shared the view that other people's thoughts are inaccessible to us ('for how much do you and I know of each other?') and suggested that if we interfere with these unknown thoughts it is because we wish to impose our own 'dull and world-corrupted' habits of mind upon other people.9 For Eliot, in contrast, people are not necessarily inaccessible to each other.10 There are degrees of failed communication rather than there being any absolute barrier between hearts or between minds. If people fail to engage with others it is because they are too involved in their own social ambitions or insecurities, as in Middlemarch we see Rosamund and Bulstrode to be; or momentarily too caught up in their own disappointment, as we see Dorothea and Will to be. Moreover, a novel can promote or hinder communication in the way the book itself is read and used by its readers. To understand how a novel participates in this process we need a good sense of what the process is in the first place: what are the terms of human togetherness, if our relations to each other are not inhibited by the unbridge able obstacles accepted by Cavell and Moi? I want to sketch an answer to this question by turning to the reflections on human connectedness in texts by Levinas' and Heidegger. The next section of my article will revisit Levinas' early critique of Heidegger's account of'being with' or Mitsein. What emerges from the juxtaposition of the two thinkers is a view of human beings as living with each other before being alone. This view challenges the Cartesian picture</page><page sequence="4">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 439 of an individual-separated-ffom-others-and-struggling-to-know-their-minds that still echoes in Cavell and Moi. However, although the idea of Mitsein invites us to shift perspective from an affirmation of isolation to an exploration of degrees of togetherness, the concept in Heidegger's texts operates, as we shall see, at a very abstract level.11 A quick glance later in my argument at recent developments in experimental psychology will suggest ways in which the forms of co-existence structuring Levinas' and Heidegger's arguments might be rendered more concrete. This will allow me to return to Levinas', and in particular his idea of proximité to argue that the question of responsi bility can be uncoupled from that of otherness: we are responsible for our togetherness more than we are for the alterity of the other. The site of this responsibility, however, is always the constrained situation of everyday life. In the final section, I will show how Eliot in her novel explores the problems of a human togetherness that is always situated, and how the marketing and social positioning of the text by Eliot, her husband and agent George Henry Lewes and publisher John Blackwood are themselves examples of an engagement with the necessary limitations of everyday life. What will emerge in the course of the argument is the degree to which otherness, or the inaccessibility of our fellow humans, is not a problem to be faced or surmounted or capitulated before. It is not a problem at all, but the expression of a certain temperament with which some people, but by no means all, go about the business of getting along with other people by avoiding them and, to use Eliot's phrase, 'calling their denial knowledge' (Middlemarch, 42: p. 462). II. ISOLATION AND TOGETHERNESS It is customary when discussing Levinas' to insist upon a difference, made in the French language, between two sorts of otherness: l'autre, and the perso nalised form autrui, generally marked in English by a capitalised Other. For Colin Davis, this distinction is 'indispensable to Levinas's thinking'. 'The other may initially appear alien to the empirical self, but it does not fundamentally challenge its superiority; the Other is utterly resistant to the transcendental Ego and cannot be assimilated to the world the Ego creates for itself.'12 As the shift in focus in this sentence from empirical selves to the transcendental Ego of Husserlian phenomenology suggests, the distinction tells us about the terms of Levinas's arguments, but not necessarily much about the world we daily live in. If we don't follow Levinas' in his bleak view of a conceptual thought monotonously reducing everything to existing models and condemning us to encounter only our own pre-conceptions, then we won't so urgently need the distinction between, on the one hand, an alterity—l'autre—which is but the negative image of what I already know and so explicable by an existing</page><page sequence="5">440 BEN MORGAN pattern, and, on the other, the raw encounter with autrui that resists all as similation. A more pluralistic world of the sort to be found in Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language or the pragmatism of a William James won't reduce conceptuality to a single uniform grid but will see different language games doing different jobs with differing degrees of success or justice. These various games are not uniformly constraining but can be played off against each other if we should require. My discussion of Levinas' will thus not focus on the question of an Other, but rather look at the way Levinas, and the Heidegger whom he criticises, come to conceive of a fundamental layer of human connectedness. As we shall see later, this is clearest in Levinas' idea of proximité. But before we get to this concept, we need first to look at his earlier thought, which has a very different emphasis, and the critique of Heidegger this generates. For Levinas, in the lectures delivered in 1946-47 that were published under the title of Le temps et l'autre (Time and the Other), human beings are first and foremost alone. Death, and the experience of an uncertain future, can disrupt our solitude from the inside and prepare us for the encounter with something beyond ourselves that, like the future, is 'absolutely surprising'.13 Nevertheless, the starting point for his argument is the subject's splendid isolation: 'I touch an object, I see the other. But I am not the other. I am all alone. It is thus the being in me, the fact that I exist, my existing, that constitutes the absolutely intransitive element, something without intentionality or relationship.'14 It is because he believes this isolation to be structural that, as well as dismissing the merely empirical level at which we hang out with and do things with each other, Levinas disputes Heidegger's idea of Mitsein or being with. He has two quarrels with Heidegger. The first is that he thinks Heidegger doesn't really follow through his intention of, as Levinas puts it, viewing 'solitude in the midst of a prior relationship with the other'.13 (In this, Levinas is like Stanley Cavell who calls Heidegger's invocation of the idea of Mitsein 'a philosophical afterthought'.)16 The second is that even if Heidegger did follow the idea through it couldn't really work in Levinas's view because we can only be 'with' something against the background of some wider category, which Levinas thinks in Heidegger's case is truth. Levinas would not be satisfied with such a desultory side by side; instead, he is looking for the unmediated confrontation of being face to face with another person in a way that deprives us of any third term by which we might make sense of the experience and recuperate it.17 Levinas and Cavell have a point when they say that Heidegger seems half-hearted in the way he treats the idea of Mitsein. But I want to suggest that this half-heartedness arises not because Mitsein doesn't fit into his overall argument, but rather because something like the 'cool conduct' that Helmut Lethen found to be prevalent in German intellectual life in the 1920s</page><page sequence="6">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 441 takes over.18 Heidegger remains too committed to a particular sort of indi vidualistic heroism to follow through the consequences of his insights into our being-with-others.19 If we can ourselves follow on where Heidegger left off, this will help us to separate a conceptual germ, or conceptual gem, from some of the habits of thought that constrained Heidegger's arguments. Where the Levinas of Time and the Other says our being alive is some thing we can't share and can't delegate—we'll come to Levinas' later position in Otherwise than Being in a moment—Heidegger responds that we're always alive somewhere and somehow. Early Levinas imagines something like a pure point of existence, which can subsequently be disrupted by death, time or the other (he thus seems still to be thinking in Cartesian terms). Heidegger, in contrast, sees our being alive as a necessary unfolding that can't be separated from the world or from other people. Indeed, he suggests that the very fact that we can feel alone proves that, at another level, we are not only structurally available to others, but in some sense, always and necessarily entwined with them.20 As Derrida pointed out in his early essay on Levinas, Levinas' reading of Mitsein overlooks the fact that for Heidegger being-with is not the desultory side-by-side of team members viewed against the background of a third concept, such as truth, that makes their meeting possible. Rather, the 'with' precedes any encounter or individ ual identity as 'an originary structure [une structure originaire}' that makes both possible in the first place.21 Levinas' account of Mitsein thus misses the point of Heidegger's initial presentation of the concept. Later in Being and Time, Heidegger goes on to emphasise experiences that he thinks isolate us, like the feeling of anxiety, and experiences which he thinks we can only do for ourselves, like dying. Heidegger's accounts of Angst and being-toward-death do then seem to step back from the claim that we are inseparable from others in the same way that we are inseparable from the world. For Tina Chanter, this suggests that the idea of Dasein inherits more from the Cartesian tradition 'than Heidegger admits'.22 Consequently she thinks the work of Levinas will better support 'feminist attempts to argue for the priority of our connection to others over the claims of individualism'.23 If we agree with Chanter, and with the comparable complaints of both Levinas and Cavell, we need to subscribe to two claims. The first is that Heidegger doesn't do what he might have done with Mitsein. That seems uncontroversial. The second is perhaps not so much a claim as an underlying assumption that challenges the very idea of Mitsein, namely that in a way that isn't anthropological or ontogenetic but somehow more important and more profound we start ne cessarily isolated from each other. How could such an assumption be backed up? William James deals with the question in his lectures on pragmatism under the rubric of the one and the</page><page sequence="7">442 BEN MORGAN many, suggesting that the assumption of things being ultimately connected with each other (something like the position I'm proposing) and the assump tion of fundamental disjunction (something like the position we've seen in Levinas, Chanter, Moi and Cavell) are both intellectual tools of equal value.24 The assumption we choose will depend partly on what we're trying to get done, and partly on our temperament, the more 'tough-minded' among us opting more often for disjunction while the 'tender-minded' will tend to choose connectedness.25 The idea that temperament could decide the ques tion of our connection to others is an aspect of pragmatism that Cavell has explicitly taken issue with. Our separation from others, and the necessity that arises from this to take responsibility for acknowledging them, shouldn't, in his view, be understood as 'the condition as of a particular temperament' but rather 'as something coincident with the human as such ... as a necessary consequence of the gift of speech'.26 But where do Cavell or Moi or Levinas or Chanter find their metaphysical certainty that we're primarily separated from each other and the world if not from a temperamental decision? I want in what follows briefly to present some 'tough-minded' evidence from recent neuroscience that suggests that we're more connected than our sense of dignity or self-respect would like to imagine. To introduce the neuroscience, I will also give a brief sketch of the counter-tradition of which contemporary neuro-psychology is the inheritor. III. THE SHARED ACTIVITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE Running alongside the habits of thought that insist on the separation between individuals, there has been a parallel tradition emphasising forms of connec tion. In terms of literature, as we have briefly seen, this means that alongside Thackeray's 'for how much do you and I know of each other' there is Eliot's patient typology of sympathy. A comparable divergence can be observed in writings on psychology. At the same time that Levinas was developing his philosophy of isolation, other thinkers were exploring alternative perspectives. Closest to Levinas in terms of intellectual context was the French develop mental psychologist Henri Wallon.27 In an article first published in 1946, Wallon summarised his opposition to the traditional philosophical starting point of an isolated consciousness, a starting point he saw reproduced in Piaget's account of the solipsistic child. In contrast to this view, Wallon ob serves what he calls 'a sort of emotional mimeticism [une sorte de mimétisme émotionnel]' or emotional contagion between mother and infant evident in the way a child from a very early stage in development responds to its mother's smile.28 Wallon concludes that we're together before we're alone, and that being separate from other people is something we leam, for instance by the games in which we exchange taps with someone. If the sense of self comes</page><page sequence="8">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 443 finally to seem stable from the inside, Wallon observes that it can change nevertheless, depending on context or age.29 For Wallon, in sum, the division between self and other is the way we artificially and contingently cut up the field of shared emotional responsiveness. Wallon was not the only figure in the 1930s and 1940s exploring aspects of human togetherness. Wallon conceived of his ideas as a modification of the Freudian idea of a supra-individual libido: the pulse of the species.30 Freud himself turned to communicative energies operating beyond or below indi vidual consciousness in a discussion of telepathy included in the second series of his introductory lectures on psychoanalysis published in 1932. While the main point of his argument is the hypothesis that behind apparent instances of telepathy we can surmise a strong, secret wish communicating itself sublim inally—Freud doesn't discuss the specific mechanisms, but this might be through body language or tone of voice—Freud also discusses the patterns of habitual communication that establish themselves between people who see each other regularly and share a taste in reading. Freud was an avid reader of Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga to which he was introduced by one of his patients. The novels became the medium of communication between the two men, the vehicle through which the unspoken tensions and disappointments of their relationship could find indirect expression.31 What appeared to be telepathy was in fact an indicator of the way a common interest in fiction was being used to negotiate togetherness: a model of the everyday uses of fiction that we should bear in mind when we return to Eliot. Freud concluded his explorations of telepathy with the speculation that there must be a more primitive level of communication running along under neath our conscious interactions and that this layer must be more noticeable in children than in the adults who have learned to mask or control it. The passage was excerpted by Walter Benjamin when he was collecting material for the essays he wrote on the topic of mimesis in the early 1930s, following a line of speculation similar to Freud's about possible visceral levels of commu nication underpinning more conscious forms of interaction.32 Benjamin had been interested in forms of interaction that precede or accompany conscious ness since the beginning of his career. In a speculative note entitled 'Psychology' written around 1918, he challenged the idea of the mind as a place to which we have privileged access if it is our own and no access if it is that of other people, insisting that the inner life of others is not perceived in a way that is different from the way we perceive our own: 'it is not deduced but rather seen directly in the bodily life that belongs to psychological life [es wird nicht erschlossen, sondern im Leiblichen, das ihm als Seelenleben zugehört, gesehen]'. The idea of a physical connection to other people and our environment is also given the name mimesis by Adorno and Horkheimer and made the central</page><page sequence="9">444 BEN MORGAN concept of their re-description of the development of instrumental rationality in Dialectic of Enlightenment.3,4 In different idioms ranging from Wallon's experimental observation to Benjamin's intuitive speculations, thinkers in the mid-20th century were thus looking for a language to describe the experiences of connectedness to which Heidegger had gestured in his analysis of Mitsein: Dasein's constitutive openness to his or her fellow humans. In developmental psychology and phenomenology, as well as in many related areas of research, investigation into the forms of human togetherness has continued under different titles: primary intersubjectivity, emotional contagion, empathy.35 The accidental discovery of mirror neurons in the 1990s gave a further impetus to research, as it seemed to offer a neural substrate for forms of emotional resonance.36 Investigations suggest that when I observe the actions and responses of other beings pursuing goals that I can recognise, the same neurons fire in my brain that would fire were I to be performing the actions myself rather than just observing them.37 I thus participate in the actions and aspirations of others. Moreover, the neurons mirroring actions do not distinguish between my own and those of others. The differentiation is a separate neural process.38 If Heidegger argued from an ontological perspective that we must be with other people at a primordial level if we are to have relationships at all, be they good or bad, the research into forms of resonance of which mirror neurons are one substrate similarly suggests that we are involved with other people before we are distinct from them. More importandy, the research demonstrates the importance of shared action. The focus on mirror neurons might seem to leave us with the picture of isolated creatures simulating each other's inner lives with the help of a neural resonance system.39 But as Hanne de Jaegher, Ezequiel di Paolo, Thomas Fuchs and Shaun Gallagher have pointed out in a series of related articles, we can only think through the consequences of the discovery of mirror neurons if we make a methodological shift and stop taking the individual brain as the starting point for investigations and start focusing instead on the dynamics of interaction.40 When humans interact, their responses coordinate with each other in ways that are measur able and that have a momentum of their own, beyond, before or below the intentions or consciousness of the people involved. Moreover, as research into infant development emphasises, and as Wallon had already argued seventy years ago, these interactions are the basis on which a sense of individual identity develops. Interaction is both methodologically and developmentally prior to individuality. Where Cavell or Moi or the early Levinas insist on a metaphysical isolation separating humans from each other, there is now a body of research support ing Heidegger's contention that the problem of other minds is an artificial one, arising from the tendency to treat human beings as one would a stone,</page><page sequence="10">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 445 that is to say, as a distinct object separate from the world and from other stones, as opposed to an active creature always already involved with his or her fellow humans and environment. At the same time, Heidegger's emphasis on a shared prior involvement qualifies an idea that frequently recurs in de Jaegher's and her colleagues discussion of enactive participation and that arises from the dynamic systems theory on which they draw. Dynamic systems theory maps the relations between individuals that are taken to be 'autonomous' or, in other words: 'a network of co-dependent, precarious processes able to sustain itself and define an identity as a self-determined system.'41 Although de Jaegher et al. concede that a 'system' can mean anything from an individual cell to a habit or a social institution, their arguments in effect equate a system with an individual person. They argue that in order for two systems to become coordinated with each other when interacting they must retain enough autonomy to respond to each other and thus produce the positive feedback and feedforward loops that give an interaction its dynamism and stability. It takes two separate systems to coordinate. This emphasis on auton omy steps back from the Heideggerian idea that a constitutive togetherness precedes loneliness or separation. It is also hard to square with de Jaegher et al.'s own formulations where they are emphasising how the autonomous dynamic of shared activity produces our identity as agents as well as shaping the very form of our projects and intentions.42 Whatever is interacting, it needn't be a person, since people are themselves the site of so many over lapping and potentially conflicting habits and interests, each one conceivable as a system.43 Eliot, in her essay of 1856 on Wilhelm Heinrich von Riehl's studies of German society, suggested that human beings could be seen as 'incarnate history'.44 It is this sense of the complex historicity of human be haviour that is missing from de Jaegher's and her colleagues' account of inter action. The routines and rituals that we leam to participate in and through which we come to a sense of our individuality pre-exist us and form us through and through. They cannot be assumed to be unified or even unifi able, though different aspects may have the autonomy necessary to generate the dynamic interaction that is the foundation and necessary background of a sense of self. If, therefore, 21st-century research helps to thicken the description of forms of human togetherness and challenge the claim by 'tough-minded' isolationists or Cavellian skeptics that human beings are tragically separated from each other, it doesn't yet entirely supersede the formulations of 20th-century phenomenology. Not only does Heidegger's insistence on a primordial 'withness' lead us to qualify what the dynamic systems theorists mean by autonomy, but also Heidegger and Levinas alike raise questions about the ethical implications of human togetherness. Heidegger asks whether, if we are always already living out the patterns of predecessors and our</page><page sequence="11">446 BEN MORGAN contemporaries, there is a particular take that we should develop on them to make them ours: can we live authentically the identity that will never be ours alone? Levinas reiterates this question with more urgency: how should we live with each other once we acknowledge how close, indeed how inseparable we are? The idea he uses to bring this question into focus is that of proximité. I use the French equivalent of the English word proximity to mark the fact that the word is used by Levinas as a term of art. Proximité does not just mean two things or two people being close to each other. It is a way of being with each other that is more fundamental than shaking hands, a caress, a struggle, col laboration, doing business with each other or having a conversation.45 It de notes an encounter that precedes or escapes the coordinates of space and time because it is that which makes both possible in the first place: in other words it means exactly that level of relatedness before any particular relation that we have seen Derrida, in his critique from the 1960s, suggest Levinas overlooked in his reading of Heidegger. Proximité is my discovery that I am not self-contained, that there is no kernel of subjectivity, but only the condition of always already having been delivered up to others without reserve. Levinas uses a perfect infinitive to express this idea—avoir-été-ojfert-sans-retenu—and notes that the non-finite form registers that this is not something that happens at a particular moment and is not something an agent initiates or even j 46 endures. Our brief foray into developmental psychology has shown us what it might mean to be delivered up to others even before having a sense of identity or agency. It is the lot of what Christine Battersby terms a 'birthed' subject: a human being of woman bom, and so co-joined and dependent, arriving in a world of shared human behaviour that moulds us and first gives us the op portunity to 'be ourselves', whatever that might mean.47 For Levinas, proximité is the state from which it is possible to have a proper relationship with some one else, precisely because it is not recognizably a relationship: we're not united with each other, not similar, not forewarned of each other's exis tence.48 The only proper relationship, for Levinas, is a non-relationship: an im-proper relationship. Such a non-relationship also falls outside the scope of memory, which would only be a way of recuperating and standardising it.49 Thus where the developmental psychologists have an originary connection forged in shared activity, Levinas replaces shared activity with the non-encounter between me (always already called, involved before a sense of identity or relationship; beyond familiar space; outside familiar time) and a 'face'. The visage for Levinas is another ordinary word turned into a term of art. A visage can't appear as other phenomena do; it can't be experienced, or reduced to the grid of what we can know. It withdraws even as it is seen: absent in its very presence.</page><page sequence="12">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 447 Levinas puts himself in the position of making his foundational—or, strictly speaking, non-foundational, 'an-archic'30—experience unavailable be cause the realm of knowledge, experience and relationships is for him so monotonously uniform.51 This realm must suffer a complete overturning (Levinas uses the French word bouleversement) before the shock of the non-encounter can occur.32 It cannot be the medium of a genuine meeting, of proximité, for proximité can have no medium. However, if we put shared activity back into the picture, and don't assume that the arena of knowledge is a standardising grid, but rather an historically accruing patchwork of practices, complete overturning won't seem so necessary. Levinas himself repeatedly affirms that the precious layer of proximité underpins the realm of discursive interaction, can still be heard behind it, and is not exhausted by it.53 Yet despite its being everywhere, it is, for him, nowhere to be accessed and structurally cannot be experienced, because experience is a mode of standardisation. We do not need to follow Levinas when he adopts this bleak picture of language and conceptuality.34 If we put it to one side, his thinking importandy challenges both the Heideggerian account of being-with, and more recent models of shared activity or participatory being in the world. For the proximité with which Levinas rediscovers the Heideggerian idea of Mitsein entails a responsibility we never consciously chose, which indeed precedes the forma tion of any agent who could 'make a choice', but which summons us never theless.53 Our being together has a call upon us. This call is not moral in the sense that we're asked to do the right as opposed to the wrong thing in answering it. Our connection to each other lies deeper than right or wrong. The call is that of a certain sincerity or vulnerability before the fact of our inexhaustible and inescapable involvement with the peopled world. If Levinas's early account of a subject 'all alone' can be challenged phenomeno logically by Heidegger's account of Mitsein and empirically by the investiga tion of shared activity and the concomitant forms of resonance and emotional contagion, his later account of togetherness under the title of proximité reminds us that togetherness is more than a fact or a stable structure. It is a predicament to which we are always answerable. But what forms will that answer take? For Levinas, answering seems to require us to step outside all available forms of social intercourse to some 'other' space: a space beyond violence, and as Derrida pointed out, beyond history.36 But if we can't follow Levinas in this step beyond history, then we need to concede that we answer the call of our human togetherness always in a particular situation, with the imperfect but improvable habits that our predicament furnishes us with. There is no way beyond what Eliot call 'the meanness of opportunity' (Middlemarch, Prelude: p. 25).</page><page sequence="13">448 BEN MORGAN IV. 'LATER-BORN THERESAS' AND THE MARKETING OF Ml DD LE M ARCH It would require more space to do justice to the many ways in which Middlemarch helps us understand how human interaction is at once stifled and nourished by the limiting historical context in which it of necessity un folds. I want to draw things together with a few brief comments about the way Eliot treats togetherness in Middlemarch and the degree to which the novel itself might be seen to have functioned as a vehicle for the sort of honesty to which we have seen the narrator admonish us in Adam Bede. The novel opens with a sense of calling, framing the story of failure and disappointment in provincial England with a reminder of the spiritual ardour of St Theresa, which it contrasts with the 'life of mistakes' that is the lot of those born later who didn't find for themselves an 'epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action' (Middlemarch, Prelude: p. 25). The novel deals with the everyday: the failed marriages of the Casaubons and the Lydgates; Fred Vincy's decision to apprentice himself to Caleb Garth so as to establish a stable enough existence to marry Caleb's daughter Mary; the bungled election campaign of Mr Brooke; the unravelling of the evangelical banker Mr Bulstrode's social position. Characters are happy to the degree that they can accept disappointment and scale down their ambitions when con fronted with 'the meanness of opportunity'. The project of the novel could be described as that of enduring the tension between unfolding longing and a limiting context without denying either. The consequent refusal to portray uplifting or ideal lives worried some read ers.^7 Others noted that the book did not orient the reader with clearly delineated heroes and villains, leaving him or her with no easy moral position to adopt.38 At the same time, reviewers noted that we know more about the lives of the Middlemarchers than we're used to finding out about our every day companions, causing a sense of'painful bewilderment'.39 Our increased knowledge is partly due to the way Eliot's narrator conducts a kind of 'het erophenomenology' of her characters' motivations, describing them sympa thetically from the inside, but also adducing specialist knowledge, like Eliot's reading of psychology, where this is illuminating, as Sidney Colvin felt it to be when the narrator reflects on small misdeeds that are 'like the subtle muscular movements which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring about the end that we fix in our minds and desire' (Middlemarch, 68: p. 739-40).60 Nevertheless, the overall result is not satisfying. Colvin notes 'that feeling of uncertainty and unsatisfiedness as to the whole fable and its impres sion which remains with the reader when all is done'. But then he asks: 'Is it that a literature, which confronts all the problems of life and the world, and recognizes all the springs of action, and all that clogs the springs, and all that comes from their smooth or impeded working, and all the importance of one</page><page sequence="14">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 449 life for the mass, — is it that such a literature must be like life itself, to leave us sad and hungry?'61 Not every reader can approve this portrayal of 'characters whom he doesn't know whether to love or hate'.62 But some understood Eliot to be portraying a failure that precisely could not be re-cast as mean ingful, or tragic, but was instead just a form of 'helpless entanglement'.63 The novel thus presents a sense of calling—Dorothea and Lydgate are parallel cases of ardour—and at the same time charts the frustration of this ardour without offering the reader a safe space from which to judge it. In the process, the novel brings us closer to characters than we are used to being with people, offering an account of their motivations and self-deceptions that can be as uncomfortable as it is astute. It is interesting to note that even those reviewers who find the book uncomfortable rarely complain that it is unreal istic. Henry James found in the portrayal of Bulstrode 'a melodramatic tinge, unfriendly to the richly natural coloring of the whole'.64 But in general, the complaint is not that the characters are implausible, but that nothing mitigates the disappointment we share with them. More importantly, the references to the 'bewilderment' readers experienced being brought so close to the char acters suggest that Eliot had found a form that broke down the conventions and attitudes that often keep our neighbours (and ourselves) at an idealising distance from ourselves. Her narrative practice enabled an encounter from which everyday habits would otherwise protect her readers. The 'heterophenomenology' of the narrative voice thus seems to be a method of dealing at the level of the reader with sorts of barriers to commu nication that we see between the characters, as for instance, when we observe Dorothea and Mr Casaubon unable to meet each other because of their own preconceptions (Middlemarch, 20: p. 232). Nevertheless, even as it focuses on obstacles to human togetherness, the narrative allows for moments of com munication, be it when Rosamund, in her encounter with Dorothea, is 'taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own' that briefly shakes her beyond her familiar view of her situation (Middlemarch, 81: p. 856), or in the two parallel portrayals of characters walking together despite their differences and disappointments: the image of Dorothea and Mr Casaubon hand in hand walking 'along the broad corridor together' that closes Book 4 of the novel (.Middlemarch, 42: p. 465), or the image of Lydgate giving his arm to the broken, fainting Bulstrode to escort him out of the meeting at which the banker is disgraced (Middlemarch, 71: 783). Characters talk and live past each other; but they can also move together, and connect, if only briefly, and indeed acknowledge and long for the transformatory power of relating to others, as when Bulstrode thinks: 'One can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a better man' (Middlemarch, 13: p. 153). The form of the novel similarly offers the reader opportunities to engage with characters despite the barriers that might otherwise inhibit the exchange</page><page sequence="15">450 BEN MORGAN by bringing us close to them, and depriving us of the moral habits by which we categorise people and keep them at a distance. But how effective was the form of the novel? A number of aspects of the way the book was marketed allow us to reconstruct how the moral opening up of the reader might have functioned in practice. The book was released in a new format: eight parts published in bi-monthly or monthly instalments that it was hoped readers would buy rather than borrow from libraries.65 As well as encouraging a personal investment in the book, the format allowed the epi sodes to be dwelled on. Colvin suggests the book modified the way people related to literary works, observing that the turning over in 'one's mind or talk' of characters who had become additions to 'one's circle of familiar ac quaintances' had a different urgency from normal, because of the moral un certainty that the book left the reader in.66 This comment is interesting both because it suggests a heightened engagement but also because it shows us the terms of this engagement. People related to the book through the characters. Colvin talks of the fictional figures as 'acquaintances'. The same approach can be found in the arrangement of the collection of Wise, Witty and Tender Sayings that Alexander Main excerpted from Eliot's novels and that went to press to coincide with the initial publication of Middlemarch, and were adver tised on the back covers of individual parts of the novel.67 The collection was subsequently published in a revised form to include passages from Middlemarch itself. The excerpts from each book are grouped together according to char acter, with one of the characters being George Eliot herself, thought to be speaking 'in propria persona' through the narrator.68 Just as in Colvin's ac count, in Main's collection of excerpts, character is the framing vehicle for the reader's engagement. The elements excerpted by Main include some of Eliot's most challenging psychological observations, such as that of Bulstrode's unwillingness to reflect on the 'the quantity of diseased motive' that encouraged him to help Lydgate free himself from debt: 'A man vows, and yet will not cast away the means of breaking his vow. Is it that he distinctly means to break it? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in him dimly, and make their way into his imagination, and relax his muscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the reasons for his vow' (Middlemarch, 70: p. 761).69 If Main's text reinforces the tendency to relate to the book through its char acters, and at the same time does not excise the disturbing ambiguity of psy chological observation, then the collection might be said to answer the objections that critics have raised about the marketing campaign associated with Middlemarch. David Payne has suggested that the collection of sayings, and the publication of the novel itself in a form that encouraged readers to pore over it, contributed to the construction of Eliot as a charismatic moral authority for a secularised age.70 This suggests that the marketing of the novel</page><page sequence="16">THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS 451 finally contributed to a form of idealization, reinforcing the structures of non-engagement and projection that the plot of the novel documented. Leah Price has similarly suggested that the effect of the collection of Sayings was to cause Eliot to write increasingly with the expectation of being ex cerpted, finding 'a way at once to inhabit and to reappropriate the persona to which Main had already lent her name'.71 Linda Hughes has suggested that Eliot found her dependence on the literary market distasteful.72 Nevertheless, Donald Gray suggests that despite maintaining the appearance of distance from the literary market, Eliot aspired to elevate the market 'by energetically help ing to promote her dignified presence in it'.73 Critics thus see Eliot as constructing a charismatic authority at odds with the market with which she hoped to elevate and transform literary commerce. At the same time, they see her submitting to a fragmentation of the novel form, and reducing texts to collections of sententious sayings, interspersed with narrative padding.74 The contemporary reviews do indeed show that Eliot's moral authority was an important aspect of the way the book was received. But what the recent reconstructions of the social effect of Middlemarch don't acknowledge is the way that even the fragmented aphorisms were engaged with because they represented character. The idea of character was the enabling precondition of the practice of excerption. Or, to put it another way, before it was a form of ideology misrepresenting the necessarily com mercial underpinnings of the literary market, and before it was an example of the fragmentation of a literary form, the novel was part of the habits by which people related to other people: a mediating technology of human togetherness. To draw things together: the plot of Middlemarch shows us the social con straints on the way Dorothea and Lydgate in particular feel answerable to their fellow humans. It also explores the habits of behaviour that prevent characters from engaging witfi each other, and ends with the suggestion that, even in their frustration, Dorothea's efforts might nevertheless have been 'incalculably diffusive' (Middlemarch, Finale: p. 896). The form of the novel, and in particu lar the 'heterophenomenological' narrative technique, helped to loosen the habits by which readers might otherwise keep the predicament of the char acters at bay. At the same time, we see how the social institution of literary character was the mediating vehicle between the fictional world and the reader's wider experience. Reviewers report a sense of bewilderment and a widening of their horizons. Without a more detailed reconstruction of the effects of reading Middlemarch in particular contexts, we can't say how much this bewilderment encouraged an acknowledgment of our prior engagement with others: an answering of the call of our human togetherness. What we see in the case that Freud reports of his shared enthusiasm for the Forsyte Saga is that fiction might be a way in which human togetherness is negotiated in an</page><page sequence="17">452 BEN MORGAN unacknowledged way, as a 'telepathy' that remains in most cases unanalysed. But even in this example, literature is not functioning in the way Beauvoir and Moi suggest as the privileged vehicle for seeing 'the world from the point of view of the other without ceasing to be ourselves'.73 Rather, it is part of everyday life, a vehicle amongst others of our being together more or less honestly. The narrative framing of a novel may, as in Middlemarch, be a place in which the trials of human togetherness are directly reflected on. But this does not mean that the result for the reader will be further conscious reflection. Indeed, conscious reflection may not be what is most needed, not only be cause the shared habits of reading for character evident in reviews and Main's collection of Sayings mean that novels are historically already part of the technology of human togetherness, but also because it's not clear that human togetherness is furthered by conscious reflection. Do we accept re sponsibility by making a conscious choice? Levinas' arguments would suggest not: our responsibility is deeper than choice. Similarly, Eliot questions the role of conscious reflection when she observes that our actions can be 'incalculably diffusive' even where our intentions and aspirations are thwarted, and main tains at the same time that we are 'incarnate history', unfolding human habits, multiple 'systems' coordinating with each other and resonating, as Rosamund and Lydgate both resonate in their encounters with Dorothea. Dorothea professes to be comforted by the belief: 'That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don't quite know what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower' (Middlemarch, 39: p. 427). But perhaps it is too much to ask to expect to know what is perfect ly good: it's enough to know what a good novel, a good doctor, a good husband or a good wife would be. But those are not things we con sciously decide but which we—you and I—are already involved in enacting together with 'real breathing men and women, who can~be chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your fellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken brave • „• » 76 justice .
