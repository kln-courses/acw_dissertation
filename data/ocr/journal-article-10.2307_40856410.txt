<plain_text><page sequence="1">Catherine Belling Narrating Oncogenesis: The Problem of Telling when Cancer Begins Most human tumors comprise a billion or more cells before we become aware of them. - Robert A. Weinberg, One Renegade Cell: The Quest for the Origin of Cancer (2) We can conclude that unmediated beginnings are unknowable. - Niels Buch Leander, "To Begin with the Beginning" (25) One morning, in December 1982, a medical student named John McCool devel- oped a headache, and he wondered what it meant. We know this because several years later he wrote about that headache in an essay entitled "Brain Tumor." His story be- gins with the headache even though on that morning the tumor had already been growing in his brain for some time, though nobody had been able to tell it was there. Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan has called illness narratives an "extreme test case" for narratology: illness threatens and disrupts embodied experience, and the "disin- tegrating body," she observes, "may threaten the very possibility of narration" (245). As I shall show, illness narratives force writer and reader to confront the problem of "narrating the unnarratable" (249). But it is not only in endings, in col- lapse and death, that the body imposes silence upon our efforts at narration. Illness narratives point to an even more disconcerting narratological truth: all bodies, even those that show no signs of disintegration or disease, challenge narration.

The experience of sickness brings it disconcertingly to light, but medical testing in the absence of symptoms does so as well, as do the biological and pathological models on which such testing is based. Such medical models rely on the myriad stories in our medicalizing culture. These stories lead us to imagine ourselves as somehow in- habiting the spaces inside us - colonizing them, if you will - and they make us imagine geographies of our insides as places at once familiar and foreign. To think this way about the regions inside us is disconcerting. The experience of psychosomatic integrity relies less on narrating the body than on the untoldness of much of it. Writing about the phenomenological limita- tions of interoception - our perception of our own bodily interiors - Drew Leder calls the inside of the body "recessive": under normal conditions it is absent from our awareness, not least because it is invisible to us (36). In what Leder calls the visceral body's "dys-appearance," it is foregrounded in our attention (and our visual imagining) by sensations we interpret as negative, as symptoms, or, less directly, by our learning that there is something wrong inside, even if we experience no bodily signs of this (69). As Leder points out, "It is precisely because the normal and healthy body largely disappears that direct experience of the body is skewed toward times of dysfunction" (86). Yet dysfunction itself precedes its rise to the surface of perceptibility from its "depth disappearance" inside the body (53). The absent vis- ceral body, I will show, may not be "normal and healthy" - just taciturn, or unin- telligible. Diseases like cancer develop before patient or doctor can know about it, making the internal body a site of unavoidable anxiety. I will show in what fol- lows that narrating the hidden beginnings of cancer has significant implications both for biomedicai science and for patients subject to public health's efforts to find early cancers. It can be profoundly difficult to tolerate the awareness that can- cer may be emerging in one's body at any moment, too soon to know or do any- thing about it. The body cannot be narrated, as body rather than as person, without disorien- tating the identity of the human subject. If our imaginations are allowed (or ex- pected) to inhabit landscapes inside us (landscapes that are always imaginary, no matter how well-informed or scientific our imagining), what happens to our habita- tion of the visible world that requires eyes and imagination to look outward? To map biomedicine's necessarily reductive accounts of "the body" onto the lived bod- ies of individuals is to encounter this intractable difference, for it means transform- ing avowedly objective accounts of neutral biological space into subjectively meaningful, darkly mysterious, and potentially treacherous places of humanoid ac- tivity, places where commerce is transacted and wars are fought and tragedies are staged - or, as we shall see, where anthropomorphized constituents of the self rebel and secede and begin their hostile proliferation. Cancer threatens healthy physio- logical function. It also threatens the internal coherence we rely on in mapping the bodies we have in our minds. This whole body is necessary to the "I" as narrating subject of human autobiography. We do not need to be sick to experience this ver- tigo. Imagining is enough. And we are now given more information and tools and encouragement to carry out this imagining than ever before.</page><page sequence="3">Narrating Oncogenesis 231 This encounter between biomedicai schemata and the way we imagine the in- sides of our own real bodies is effective in producing explanations and promoting treatments. It has less salubrious effects, too. As Foucault implied in The Birth of the Clinic, to turn the medical gaze onto ourselves is to participate in policing the health of what we find there. Efforts to envisage and demystify pre- symptomatic tu- mors in particular bodies - to tell when cancer begins - concern more than diagno- sis. We are expected to take some responsibility for the healthy governance of these regions. Preventive medicine, informed by the science of epidemiology and trans- lated by the discourses of public health, tells us how. We must be vigilant, seeking out lurking disease before it can ambush us. This effort at telling also produces new stories about the body and new ways of thinking about the mental maps we have of our own bodies. The biomedicai effort to narrate oncogenesis has the side effect - discursively if not organically - of making all of us people with cancer. Stories about cancer begin, necessarily, with the discovery that a patient's con- dition has already departed from the deceptive bodily quietude we call health. In his final year as a medical student, John McCool, as we have seen, learnt that he had a brain tumor. McCool's narrative, written for a collection of autobiographical ill- ness narratives by physicians, begins like this: "It was the beginning of December 1982, halfway through my final year of medical school when it started. I had just shifted accommodation to commence an obstetrics course. After my first night's sleep at the new hospital I woke normally but, on sitting up, quickly developed a pe- culiar, throbbing headache" (277). The narrator identifies a specific temporal start- ing point for his account, in this case the moment when the tumor first produced a sensation potentially legible as a symptom. Or, to be more precise: McCool begins his narrative at the point when, in retrospect, he can tell that "it started." At the time, "it" was the beginning of a new day, at the beginning of December, and the begin- ning of a new obstetrics course, but it was not the beginning of cancer. A headache is just a headache - simply a sensation, albeit an aversive one - until a human sub- ject interprets it, reading it as a symptom, a bodily sign that means something is wrong inside. The interpretation of a sensation as a symptom is an act of emplotment, since it entails imagining a cause and a narratable trajectory in which to situate the sensa- tion - which may last, or go away on its own, require analgesics, get much worse, and so on. To become a symptom, then, a feeling must first be embedded in an im- plied narrative. McCool's headache becomes the sign that "it [had] started" when, as is a convention of illness narratives, he reads the sensation as a symptom. Mc- Cool as medical-student-protagonist seeks its meaning, considering, and at first re- jecting, the explanation of malignancy. The reader and McCool as author-narrator know the symptom's meaning already: this text's title is, after all, "Brain Tumor." According to Edward Said, the beginning of a text is "the first step in the in- tentional production of meaning" (5; emphasis original). In beginning with the headache, McCool endows meaning on it that exceeds that of symptomology. He makes it the point at which, both for himself and for his readers, this story of cancer begins. His selection of it to begin his story is determined by his recollection of the headache as the signifier for something he only later decoded. One might call the</page><page sequence="4">232 Catherine Belling headache the sign with which his cancer announced itself - but to put it this way is inaccurate, for it anthropomorphizes the cancer, giving it voice and intent. The fun- damental problem here is that our inner bodies are stubbornly incommunicative. It is the patient who must interpellate the cancer, later, through the intentional (and usually collaborative and medical) production of meaning we call diagnosis.1 Even when the narrative discourse, the sjuzhet, begins later than the conven- tional onset of cancer narratives (symptoms or diagnosis), the earliest of the elided or delayed narratable events, the beginning of the fabula, must be subsequent to the appearance of cancer cells inside the body (or, to correct myself again, to their ma- terialization, for at this stage they are not apparent to anyone). McCool could have started "Brain Tumor" by describing his condition at the time of writing - remis- sion - but his story's beginning would still have been with the first sensation he re- members as a symptom.2 In his analysis of the narration of birth as a biological beginning, Niels Buch Leander argues that "there can be no beginning independent of the particular narra- tive we bring to it" (17). There is no beginning without the story it begins. If Mc- Cool had believed that his headache was caused by, say, sleeping in an under- ventilated room (and of course we can never be entirely sure that this is not the case: that the real- world referents of McCool' s nonfictional headache and his nonfictional cancer are in fact causally connected) and if it had not recurred, it would not have become a beginning, even despite a later discovery, based on some other sign, of the tumor. It is the subjective human reconstruction of experience as narrative that marks some conditions or events as beginnings. Consider birth: the emergence of a new person into the world seems an irrefutably natural starting point, but it is marked as such by the infant's sudden visibility and tangibility to observing others, not by its prior non-existence. The change from fetus to infant has biological components (it starts to breathe, for instance), but birth's status as a biographical beginning (this is the date we record as marking the start of the life story) is a (probably necessary) cultural construct. Changes occur, but only by narrating can we tell (in both senses) that a change is the start of something. And to be narratable as a beginning, a change must also be apprehended as such by a narrating subject. This is why, for in- stance, imaging technologies that visualize the fetus in utero have complicated our sense of birth as beginning (and why the mother's experience of quickening used to be marked as the beginning of fetal life). And why a headache rather than a dividing malignant cell marks the beginning of a cancer narrative. Pathographies begin not with the emergence of disease but with the emergence of the narrator-author as a diseased person. The patient's story about having cancer is tangential to the course we might try to plot of the cancer itself, at least until med- ical interventions bring the two trajectories together. To mark one's own awareness of a cancer as "the beginning" is to bracket out the physical processes that have en- abled that story to produce one as a subject- with-cancer. Leander compares two formal approaches to the problem of selecting and nar- rating beginnings. The simpler strategy is to restrict narratability to the experience of the narrating subject: a first-person narrator recounts only what he or she can re-</page><page sequence="5">Narrating Oncogenesis 233 member from a stable present perspective, so that, for instance, the fabula of an autobiography would take as its beginning not the narrator-subject's birth but his or her first coherent and articulable memory: "This limits the opening's dependency on secondhand sources, and the explicit indication of the narrator's limits" offers "a different standard of reliability" (25). McCool, like most if not all pathographers, uses this strategy, opening his story with the first symptom he can remember and can retrospectively attribute to the tumor. The second strategy Leander describes is to "search for a natural beginning," one apparently independent of the narrator's construction (23). The most obvious of these, as he shows, is the biological event of birth, though it can be marked as a be- ginning only in the selective context of other narratives, rather than as a natural event, an origin independent of human recounting. The "natural beginning" also tends to produce an infinite regression to earlier events, both biological and cul- tural: implantation, fertilization, gametogenesis, the meeting of parents, their births and ancestry, and so on. In narrative, the ab ovo origin capitulates to the question of the chicken and the tgg. In attempting to narrate the beginning of cancer, as opposed to diagnosis or the onset of symptoms, then, we are faced with a distinction between the human and the natural, or between the subjective and what might be called the inhuman - the scale and setting inside living human bodies where events happen that seem intractably out of reach of narration because they cannot ever be apprehended as and where they occur. Here the objects of biomedicai science do not map onto any particular subject of human experience, much as we should like them to. Our visceral bodies, despite their species, are not, according to many of our definitions of the word, human. To narrate them, we must first imagine and humanize them, constructing the subjective habitation which marks the material of the body as place. The beginning of a narrative text circumscribes and begins to contain the story it narrates. Illness narratives, however, resist circumscription and containment, not just because, as Rimmon-Kenan has shown, they record the experiencing body and its subject under siege, but also because they remind us that the stories we tell about our sick and dying bodies always begin too late, even when they begin at the very moment we apprehend the presence of disease and become phenomenologically ill. This delay has significant implications for the ways we imagine our bodies, their in- sides the setting for events always already happening while we wait, anxiously, to be allowed to begin to tell the story. A significant project of biomedicai science, though it is seldom framed this way, is to tell the prequelae of conventional illness narratives, to find a way to render our inhuman interiors articulate. This evidence- based ventriloquism is what enables medicine to treat disease because, as the sur- geon-philosopher Miles Little has said, "It is narrative which confers meaning on science" (1144). The process of conferring meaning on the objects of biomedicai science - in this case human bodies - is never a neutral one. Although efforts to start stories of cancer closer to their oncogenetic origins are well-intentioned and have saved lives, troubling consequences can follow from making bodies into places of narratable disease before the subject would normally know that such a dis- ease was there.</page><page sequence="6">234 Catherine Belling BIOLOGY'S HIDDEN AGENDA Is a beginning the same as an origin? Is the beginning of a given work its real beginning, or is there some other, secret point that more authentically starts the work off? - Edward Said, Beginnings (3) Cancer begins when a cell . . . begins to follow its own agenda. - National Cancer Institute/NIH, "Understanding Cancer" Cancer-patient pathographers narrate disease in order to make meaning. Bio- medical scientists do much the same. Just as a physical sensation must first be em- bedded in an implicit narrative in order to become a symptom, so a cell or lesion or physiological change must, in order to become "cancer," be embedded in the med- ical narratives of oncogenesis, tumor development, and diagnosis. Medicine's goal is to begin stories of cancer earlier, smaller, and deeper: with microscopic - and prehistoric - genetic and cellular events concealed inside the body's substance. Part of the horror evoked by cancer is the sense that, as Edward Said puts it, "some other, secret point" must be a more authentic beginning to its story than the patient or even the doctor can tell. As a "secret," this origin is easily imagined as the product of something devious and sinister lying in ambush for the subject who has unwittingly been sharing a body with it. The science of cancer is profoundly concerned with exposing this secret and telling it. But narration is diffi- cult for science, since its stories need to be both reductive and generalizable. To count as a beginning, a change must be registered by an anthropomorphic, experiencing, and - sooner or later - narrating subject. Yet no subject can register the changes we call the beginning of cancer as they are happening in any single liv- ing human body. Not only can no patient feel the mutations and divisions that pro- duce the first malignant cells, but no medical imaging technology can watch such changes in vivo, even though it can identify the effects they produce (palpable or vi- sualizable lesions, biomarkers in the blood, and so on). Oncogenesis can be simu- lated in a laboratory, but the in vitro (or lab animal) model is an uneasy stand-in even for the generalized human body that is biomedicai science's object, let alone for the living body of any particular person. In distinguishing between transitive beginnings (like "He began his story") and intransitive, implicitly natural (and inhuman) origins (like "The cancer began"), Said separates the circumscribed narrative from its implicit but unknowable refer- ential material, be it matter or myth. The question relevant to telling cancer is not whether that earlier emergence took place - we know it must have - but rather whether it would ever be possible for this "more authentic" opening to "start the work off." In other words, is the origin of any particular cancer narratable at all? We have come, as a culture, to expect that medicine can achieve this. We tend to trust that such an origin is "more authentic" precisely because we (as potential patients) cannot observe or narrate it ourselves, because it transcends the human, because we</page><page sequence="7">Narrating Oncogenesis 235 think of it as being accessible only to some objective and omniscient biomedicai observer. But of course this is a false belief. Such beginning is not accessible at all. Imagine a doctor giving you a diagnosis like this: "A few minutes ago, two dif- ferent mutations took place when DNA replicated right here in your cerebellum, changing the genetic structure of the resulting neuron. This has just produced the first cell of a malignant brain tumor." Such perpetual vigilance is impossible. Imag- ine what the doctor might say next. "Let's keep an eye on it for the next hour or two and make sure that your immune system eradicates the mutant cell completely." The malignancy might well fail to survive, and your brain tumor story would be over be- fore it had quite begun. But this is not a story medicine can tell. Implicit in the event chronology of in- dividual cancer narratives (symptom, physical exam, CT scan or MRI, biopsy, surgery) are the other events that medicine infers in retrospect from their observable effects or sequelae: mutation, hyperplasia, dysplasia, cancer in situ, invasive can- cer, metastasis. Cancer staging (with zero, cancer in situ, the earliest, preceded by premalignancy, which in turn would be preceded by genetic changes with their car- cinogenic etiologies) is a way of marking the point at which two chronologies in- tersect: the patient's life up to diagnosis, and the cancer's development up to diagnosis. Somewhere along this progression, clinical evidence will show that dis- ease is present but has not been observable until now. No one can give an exact, nonfictional account - a natural history - of how an individual tumor begins because the referents of such a narrative - the historian's data and documents - are inaccessible. We can and do, though, imagine cancer in- side bodies. What we imagine varies greatly; our originary hypotheses may range from genetic recoding to temperature imbalances to a flesh-consuming parasitic crab or the seeds of a remembered sin. We may imagine a primarily visual process rather than a felt, visceral one. We may have been taught implicit stories about biol- ogy, such as this:3 Fig. 1. BSCS &amp; Videodiscovery.

To describe the steps of cancer formation is to try to construct a speculative proto-narrative, to imagine mapping the reductive accounts of scientific generalization onto the individual bod- ily referent of a nonfictional illness narrative. This discord between the specificity of narrative and the reductionism of scientific models is evident in biomedicine's own efforts to tell us what it knows about how cancers begin. In 1998, Robert A. Weinberg, the M.I.T. biologist who was the first to identify a human oncogene, wrote a book about science's understanding of how cancer begins and, in particular, of the intracellular and genetic changes that constitute oncogenesis. The book's title, One Renegade Cell: The Quest for the Origin of Cancer, reflects the dual storyline of Weinberg's account, which is both about how any cancer begins as a single malignant cell and about science's search not for a beginning but for "the ori- gin."4 In this history, biologists are heroes on a "quest," their grail not just the rene- gade cell - the treacherous apostate - that establishes disease in a particular patient, but also the site of that initial apostasy, the kind of starting point Edward Said called the "other, secret point that more authentically starts the work off." In fact, then, there are three plots implicit in Weinberg's title: the scientific quest (as a documentable his- tory); the story of the process of biological oncogenesis (as a mythical genesis - al- beit one based on scientific evidence - that must be reconstructed in the laboratory); and, if the "one" in the title is taken as referring literally to a specific cancer cell, the realist narration of oncogenesis in a particular person. This last must be imagined by imposing the most current mythic origin story told by biology onto the details of a particular known patient's body. It is necessarily a speculative narrative, though it is equally necessary that medicine act on it as if it were incontrovertibly factual. At the beginning of his book, Weinberg gives a preliminary description of the process whose plotting is his subject, and at once he must oscillate between the gen- eral and the particular, the continuous present tense and the narrative preterite: "The creation of a tumor is an extraordinarily slow process, often extending over decades. The cells forming a tumor are all lineal descendents of a single progenitor, a distant ancestor that lived many years before the tumor mass became apparent. This founder, this renegade cell, decided to go off on its own, to begin its own growth pro- gram within one of the body's tissues. Thereafter, its proliferation was controlled by its own internal agenda rather than the needs of the community of cells around it" (2-3). In his genealogy of the mutant line we call cancer, chemical accident (the er- roneous DNA replication producing an oncogene) inspires a kind of mutiny, the progenitor cell a deserter who rejects the communitarian rules of its society. In this history, the cell is the "distant ancestor," the prehistoric forerunner whose story is still, even in science's account, "distant" from the deictic "now" of the narration, a present moment at some point after the "tumor mass became apparent" - to whom? The beginning of even a hypothetical tumor is reconstructed, then, from the sympto- matic-diagnostic starting point of conventional illness narratives. But the tense of the following sentence shifts to the preterite, and the ancestor cell is now our protago- nist: "[one day, it] decided to go off on its own." From recounting a general prehis-</page><page sequence="9">Narrating Oncogenesis 237 tory, Weinberg has now begun a narrative proper, with a clear starting event, the ac- tion of going off alone that is deliberately initiated by the decision of a protagonist, a cell endowed with volitional agency. The renegade cell is individualized, given sub- jectivity and an independent "agenda," in narrative terms the initiatory and proleptic production of meaning that is implicit in any recognizable textual beginning. How do Weinberg's implied narratives situate a human patient? Biomedicine, in order to tell when and how disease begins, must also tell a story, and, in order to do this, it tells with the voice of a knowing and narrating subject, and tells about a protagonist, the renegade cell with its sinister (or just selfish) hidden agenda. The human patient - or, rather, host (for such a person would not yet be a cancer pa- tient) - is either part of, or constituted by, an orderly community, the status quo re- jected by the renegade cell at cancer's point of departure, or it is the neutral, effectively invisible, setting or medium for this history, the space in which it hap- pens. Either way, person becomes environment, and microscopic entities are per- sonified as the active inhabitants that modify the body's internal geography and may eventually destroy it. The deictic narrative present Weinberg marks by the imagined appearance - or apparent-ness - of a tumor is no longer the starting point it was before. The human perspective has been replaced by a semi-personified mi- crobiological one. The scientific story of oncogenesis, then, relies on both the complete efface- ment of the human and the partial anthropomorphosis of the renegade cell. One can go further: the person I infer as necessary site for the cancer's emergence and even- tual appearance is in fact eliminated altogether. While the author means to describe cancer in the human body - even in a particular human body, though he doesn't specify which - his account is effectively and unavoidably in vitro, placed in the narrative equivalent of a petri dish in a laboratory, independent of the living human body it posits as necessary but does not in fact imagine or represent. Later in his book, Weinberg explicitly defines science's account of oncogene- sis as narrative: "The story of how cancer begins seemed so very simple. A muta- genic chemical invaded a cell, struck a critical proto-oncogene, and converted it into an oncogene. The cell, responding to the orders issued by the oncogene, began a program of unconstrained proliferation" (45). There are two stories here. Wein- berg announces he is going to describe - re-recount - a story that is part of his his- tory of science's recent stories about cancer, a story about stories. This initial story, he says, from the vantage point of a more informed present, seemed simple. By im- plication, then, it was not. Weinberg recounts this seemingly simple story in the past tense. This is how things happened, he says, but he implies that this is only how they happened in the old story he is about to discredit: the chemical invaded the cell and changed its genes. The protagonist was attacked and transformed - or rather, the next sentence implies, it would have been, had the story been true. For Weinberg immediately continues, "Copies of the oncogene would be passed on to all of the descendants of the initially mutated cell, driving them into forced marches of unre- lenting growth and division. Eventually, after some years, a throng of billions of cells would accumulate to form a life-threatening tumor" (45). The account be- comes conditional, just as the life being threatened is hypothetical.</page><page sequence="10">238 Catherine Belling Weinberg continues with a further move, out into the realm of the human sub- ject, to his true protagonists, the biologists: "Those who liked to reduce complex processes to simple explanations were very pleased by this idea. Here was a clear example of how research in molecular biology could uncover a hidden mechanism of great simplicity - so simple and logical that scientists would describe it as 'beau- tiful' " (45). Weinberg is trying here to resist the reductionism of biologists seduced into making this error by the beauty of the story produced by such selectivity. As Weinberg says, though, the elegance of this story does not make it good science: "some thought the scheme was much too simple. They even called it simplistic, and implied that those who believed in it were intentionally ignoring much that was known about cancer formation" (45). The in vitro internal coherence that biology strives for, unable to avoid applying aesthetic as well as scientific criteria, belies the need for its story to map onto the nonfictional referents inside particular individual living bodies. Weinberg' s book is written for the educated lay reader. Its goal is to enable non-biologists to inform their imagining of cancer's beginnings, and the various mi- cronarratives that animate his story contribute to this purpose. The scientists he de- scribes must of course also select and shape information in order to construct a narratable account of oncogenesis. The price, for science, is that animation and sim- plification, in making meaning, also appear to distort a reality it desires to grasp as objectively apprehensible, independent of representation and medium. Nonetheless, the practice of biology cannot avoid employing the strategies of storytelling. The following example, from the medical journal Brain Pathology, is about hereditary susceptibility to cancer. As well as oncogenesis, then, it also concerns etiology and predisposition - the causes and conditions that necessarily precede what will later be identified as a beginning: "Brain tumors are associated with several familial can- cer predisposition syndromes. ... In these syndromes, individuals inherit a germline mutation in a tumor suppressor gene. Tumors initiate when the remaining copy of the tumor suppressor is mutated or silenced, giving rise to cells with a growth advantage. Because tumorigenesis requires the accumulation of multiple mutations in cells, these individuals have an increased tumor risk because all cells carry an initial mutation" (Reilly 121-22). The initial mutation in these syndromes is inherited, and this means that such individuals begin one step further than normal along the process that precedes and produces cancer. Some people are made of cells already predisposed to apostasy. But to trace the predisposing factors is to select one prequel and make of it the orig- inary story. The real purpose of Reilly's article, titled "Brain Tumor Susceptibility: The Role of Genetic Factors and Uses of Mouse Models to Unravel Risk," is to ad- dress and, where possible, eliminate the confounding details any human individual brings to the process the authors need to recount. The study examines the use of laboratory-initiated cancer in mice to model the factors affecting human suscepti- bility to brain tumors: "When studying genetic risk factors in human populations, one must consider and control for many confounding variables. Mouse models of human cancer allow one to start with a relatively homogeneous system and layer on complexity in a controlled way" (122). Science and narrative share the goal of con-</page><page sequence="11">Narrating Oncogenesis 239 trolling complexity. Science uses selection to make sense of events as they happen and sometimes is able to make some events happen rather than others. Furthermore, any telling of these events is inevitably selective, as telling always is. But reality - in this case the material reality of cancer's emergence within a particular person - is transformed when understood or described as a linear, causal plot. Science must represent, despite its revelatory aspirations. Bracketing out the human moves human agency somewhere else in the narra- tive - and displaces uncontrollable complexity onto its subtext. As the NIH online teacher's guide puts it: "Cancer begins when a cell . . . begins to follow its own agenda" (National Cancer Institute/NIH, "Understanding Cancer"). Two begin- nings are proposed here, the intransitive, non-narrative "cancer begins" and a more complex one: cancer, the renegade cell, "begins to follow its own agenda." This sec- ond beginning implies a transitive proposition like "cancer establishes an agenda," and narrativity is unavoidable here, even though the intentionality it implies, the de- liberate beginning of a meaningful plot, entails a leap to anthropomorphism. Wein- berg's metaphorical renegade exists in an allegory of oncogenesis. The metaphor, extended to narrative, is how we tend to think about the inside of the body, usually absent to us except as we deliberately imagine it. But just as literary fictions are meaningless unless they are selective representations of imaginable worlds, so biol- ogy's anthropomorphic narratives establish plot parameters that enable science to manage complexity. These plots are then superimposed on individual bodies as in- stances of the human populations about which bioscience can tell generalized ac- counts. The general and the specific have a clear contact zone when actual patients are screened for cancer, in medicine's attempt to begin a patient's cancer narrative earlier in the disease's occult plot, narrowing the gap between hidden origin and narrated beginning but never closing it. EARLY DETECTION In lieu of recollection, impossible in light of the incontrovertible lack of bodily experience, what the process of detection yields instead is a métonymie dis- placement of the missing body onto a body of evidence. - Mark E. Workman, "Obscured Beginnings in Personal Narratives of Sexual Jealousy and Trauma" (25 1 ) Mark E. Workman's analysis is about the unfaithful (or sexually stolen) body. Sexual jealousy arises, he explains, from imagining an event at which the imaginer could not be present. So a detective must be hired to find evidence of the act of infi- delity believed to have preceded the shocking revelation that it may have happened already, in the subject's absence. This anxious effort to detect a bodily event one be- lieves one possesses, but to which one has been denied access, and which one usu- ally wishes had not taken place, closely resembles the cancer patient's desire to find out more about a bodily betrayal that has already and irrecoverably taken place. These events cannot be recollected, remembered, in even the most thoughtful</page><page sequence="12">240 Catherine Belling pathography. They need the detective work of medicine to reconstruct - reinvent - them, to displace them in bodily form onto the evidence that supports the story told about them. Medicine also tries to detect infidelity - to spot the treacherous rene- gade cell - before such revelation might normally be possible. It is through this process of "early detection" that diagnosis can precede symptoms in the patient's account of cancer, populating the places an asymptomatic person imagines inside herself with malign inhabitants. The National Cancer Institute's Early Detection Research Network describes its work like this: "A major initiative . . . will assist in the translation of [biological] discoveries into methods for detecting these warning signals, sometimes even be- fore full-blown cancer can develop, by creating the first comprehensive network to develop and validate early detection markers for cancer" ("NCI Announces Cre- ation"). Early detection reconstitutes inarticulate cellular changes as "warning sig- nals," efforts from the body's innerspace to make meaning and to make contact. A warning is not a neutral observation. It demands an active response, with an implicit "or else" to follow should it not be heeded. Early detection is, by implication, car- ried out in order to intervene in a process that has already begun so as to thwart its progress, to derail an agenda that has begun to be followed by imposing strict new governance on the inner body. But intervention is not always possible or effective. Brain tumors are especially difficult to find early - or early enough. Based in the Department of Neurosurgery at NYU Medical Center, The Brain Tumor Foun- dation promotes early detection programs. Their web site includes the statement that an "estimated one million Americans have undiagnosed brain tumors" ("Early Detection"). What implicitly follows from this claim is that these brain tumors should be diagnosed as soon as possible and that the only barrier is access to screen- ing technology: "But how do we find brain tumors earlier? You cannot feel a brain tumor as you can a breast tumor. We need mammography for the brain, and that means MRI. The Brain Tumor Foundation proposes a program of low-cost, screen- ing MRIs to detect brain tumors earlier. . . . The only way to 'cure' a cancer is to find and treat it early - before symptoms arise. Before it is too late." The Founda- tion assumes that it is better to know one has a brain tumor than not. But this may not always be true. As the disclamatory scare quotes around the word "cure" hint, brain tumors are not only hard to find; they are also very hard to treat effectively and are, at present, very seldom curable. To screen a patient out of the present cancer population is also not the same as eliminating future cancers in that person. Screening is an epidemiological term, and its focus is less on the individual whose cancer is found early than on the population whose overall cancer morbidity and mortality might be quantified and then, ideally, reduced. Early detection programs, for the few whose disease is "caught" early and the fewer who can be cured, is an unarguable good, and it is hard to weigh other fac- tors against even one saved life. But there are costs to seeking out the beginning of cancer in asymptomatic individuals. A 2005 NIH report on early detection in neuro- oncology suggested that until pre- symptomatic diagnosis of brain tumors can actu- ally result in more effective treatment, it is probably unethical: "Early detection has not been an area of interest or focus in neuro-oncology. Because early treatment for</page><page sequence="13">Narrating Oncogenesis 241 many types of brain tumors does not improve quality or prolong length of life, early detection strategies have not been a priority and their use may not be ethical" (Cairncross). The detection, here, is what produces the cancer narrative, not the presence of cancer, and early diagnosis means that the patient becomes a person- with-cancer sooner. In an existential sense, early detection in fact produces "can- cer" (which is of course not the same as causing biological neoplasms). For the majority, screening will simply provide (after a more or less anxious wait for re- sults) the short-term reassurance that cancer has not (yet) begun, and for some it will provide the agony of the false positive, with the cost and risks of the further testing that eventually establishes this error. Early detection can also mean identify- ing a pre-cancerous lesion or, now, the genetic mutation that predisposes one to can- cer, producing that odd cancer-patient identity, the "previvor." The pre-cancerous person, like the pre-cancerous lesion, is in effect without cancer, but she is defined by a speculative agenda that emplois pre-malignancy not as "not cancer" or as "not yet and maybe never to be cancer," but as "about-to-be cancer." A beginning - or a prequel - can exist only when the rest of the story is assumed to follow. Even before detection, medicine and public must be aware of that story, of the condition whose beginning may or may not already have taken place. (In the terms of Workman's article, before the detective can be hired, the subject must first imagine infidelity and then suspect that it has already happened.) As well as promoting early- detection screening programs, the Brain Tumor Foundation works to raise "public awareness of brain tumor issues," holding "an annual Brain Tumor Awareness Day, which brings together prominent physicians, researchers, survivors, care experts, pa- tients, their family members and friends to exchange information and share experi- ences" ("About Us"). The unequivocal beginning of an autobiographical cancer narrative, with symptoms or diagnosis, early or late, is always necessarily preceded, then, by factors that predispose one not to developing cancer but to emplotting cer- tain signs or sensations as pathological and as possible symptoms of cancer. The dis- covery of a cancer does not emerge from a narrative vacuum. In order to be diagnosed, it must already be present both in the patient's body and in the cultural imaginative landscape of patient and clinician (and, hence, society). Cancer aware- ness predisposes us not to cancer but to the search for and the diagnosis of cancer, as well as to the treatment of cancer. As such it also predisposes us to anxiety. In her study of the "ribbon culture" of disease awareness, sociologist Sarah Moore persuasively describes this performed imagining not as knowledge about medical conditions but as a display of self- awareness. At the same time, she exam- ines "worry," which she describes as a particularly "nagging" kind of fear, as a sig- nificant manifestation of disease awareness (123). To be actively aware of the possibility of disease in one's own body and those of one's loved ones is necessar- ily to imagine that cancer has already begun there, or may be about to do so. The possibility of early detection, then, is reliant on the speculative telling of the cancer narrative both as a conditional, but possible, origin inside the body and in the fore- telling of a conditional, but possible, phenomenological beginning of symptoms and diagnosis. As Martha Stoddard Holmes has shown in her analysis of "not imag- ining cancer," some diseases are both anatomically and culturally predisposed to</page><page sequence="14">242 Catherine Belling develop in secret for longer than others are, and public health efforts that reduce the likelihood of missed or late diagnoses are certainly valuable. But awareness of what is feared is very hard to isolate from the fear itself, even in the absence of its object. ONCOGENESIS OF THE IMAGINATION It's hard to say when the hypochondria started. I'd been worried about my health for as long as I could remember, the anxiety growing like a tumor, each year introducing a new way to die. - Jennifer Traig, Well Enough Alone (3) Oncogenesis happens, but because we cannot tell exactly when it happens in a particular person, a cancer's beginning can be narrated with specificity only as fic- tion. I have found just one direct narrative account of the beginning of a particular brain tumor. It makes the beginning of cancer and the beginning of the story of that cancer into the same thing. This unlikely account forms the beginning of a popular novel by the physician-author Robin Cook: January 4. Monday, 7:05 A.M. Helen Cabot gradually awoke as dawn emerged from the winter darkness blanketing Boston. ... At first she didn't open her eyes, luxuriating under the down comforter of her canopied bed. Totally content, she was mercifully un- aware of the terrible molecular events occurring deep inside her brain. (1) This text bears similarities to the nonfictional cancer pathography I started with. It begins at a precisely specified date (and time). The human protagonist is also spec- ified, named by the third-person narrator who, at first, inhabits her perspective. Helen Cabot wakes up one winter morning, just as John McCool does in his brain tumor story. Helen Cabot, however, does not have a headache. She is "mercifully unaware" that there is anything wrong, and her perspective is limited to its immedi- ate present. She is in no position to make retrospective sense of this moment, to tell that it is a beginning. Instead, there is the narrator who quickly signals that he knows a great deal more than Helen can: he recounts what happened inside her brain at five past seven that Monday morning. He is impossibly omniscient in his access to the inside of her body. (And I use the masculine gender because it is diffi- cult not to identify him with the author, who is a physician, and whose expert knowledge, as signaled by the picture of him with white coat and stethoscope in his jacket photograph, gives him both the vocabulary and the presumed authority to construct this impossible vantage point.) We learn two things right away: there are "terrible" events happening among the molecules in Helen Cabot's brain, and she doesn't know about them. Her aware- ness is both bracketed out by the narrator and put in the context of a new protago- nist, one that, like Weinberg's renegade cancer cell, has an independent plot: "Unfortunately the security that Helen enjoyed ... did not take into account that na-</page><page sequence="15">Narrating Oncogenesis 243 ture does not respect temporal wealth and power. Nature works according to its own agenda" (2). The human plot is displaced, in this move to the microscopic and inte- rior, by the inhuman but intentional (and implicitly sinister) biological agenda that is being followed by Helen's body. Cook's narration begins less to resemble Mc- Cool's pathography than it does Weinberg's account of cellular oncogenesis. The events occurring in Helen's brain, unknown to her, were being dictated by the DNA molecules that comprised her genes. And on that day in early Janu- ary, four genes in several of her brain's neurons were gearing up to produce certain encoded proteins. These neurons had not divided since Helen was an infant, which was normal. Yet now because of these four genes and their resultant proteins, the neurons would be forced to divide again, and to keep on dividing. A particularly malignant cancer was about to shatter Helen's life. At age twenty-one, Helen Cabot was potentially "terminal" and she had no idea. (2) Nature's agenda is carried out - on the material level, "dictated" - by genes, and Cook's narrator has observed their activity in precisely the way our imaginary physician could, recounting a diagnosis of cancer - or rather, of pre-malignancy - based on the observation of what can never be watched in real time. Here, then, oncogenesis is narrated explicitly as the prequel to the patient's cancer story. The cancer is "about to shatter" her life. Cook's use of "would" is not subjunctive here, does not mean that were this true, these cells would behave in this way, but rather constitute the retrospective anticipation of cancer's incipient emergence. Narrator and reader, then, know things about the protagonist's body and, importantly, about her future, that she cannot. Cook's facility with the language of biomedicai science makes his account deceptively accessible, the events he describes at least indirectly imaginable. The reader temporarily abandons complacent Helen to focalize through that impossibly omniscient physician who tells the cancer story before symptoms appear or normal technology can detect pathology. But even this fiction has limitations. It might seem that the biological account of a cancer's beginning coexists here with a biographical account of the person it threatens. But Cook's narrator has to remind us, three times in two paragraphs, that his human protagonist is oblivious to the condition of her brain. We cannot hold the two perspectives in view at the same time, even in fiction. Even this narrator must shut out Helen's mind in order to recount the matter in her head. Cook's narration enables us to apprehend the beginning of a cancer in a partic- ular person (albeit an imaginary one) at the moment of materialization and to un- derstand this genesis as a textual beginning, the inception in Said's terms of the intentional production of meaning. But most readers are not physicians and, rather than providing a wish-fulfillingly all-seeing medical role, the narration also inter- pellates the reader into the position of the human character, Helen Cabot, whose defining characteristic, along with her cancer, is her ignorance. This move, in turn, is designed to make readers reflect on their own ignorance. We cannot tell what is happening inside our own bodies, but we can now imagine, in persuasively seien-</page><page sequence="16">244 Catherine Belling tifie terms, the kind of "terrible molecular events" Cook has described. And, imag- ining, we are likely to worry that we, like Helen, may simply be "mercifully unaware" of cancers inside. The novel Terminal is, of course, one of the medical thrillers for which Cook is well known. Its central plot is not primarily about oncogenesis but about a health care conspiracy to produce cancer deliberately - its primary villain is a human being, not "nature." But the prologue, as in many of Cook's novels, establishes the inside of the human body - implicitly the reader's body - as a site of anxiety by virtue both of its inaccessibility and it imaginability, given the right model narratives, as a place where "terrible events" may be taking place, in secret, at any moment. Because the inside of the body is resistant to narration, we keep telling stories about it - not just the illness narratives Rimmon-Kenan calls a "test case" for narra- tology, but also the uneasy stories we must tell ourselves in order to decide to seek medical attention, the ones that put sensations in the role of symptoms and, perhaps, reinvent us as settings for the adventures of renegade cells. Oncogenesis, as Said's origin - that "other, secret point that more authentically starts the work off" - is what haunts cancer narratives, both those told retrospectively after diagnosis and also those told proleptically by people who may or may not have cancer at present but who imagine, fearfully, that it may be there, somewhere inside them, already. For these, neither evidence nor reassurance may be available. As I have shown, then, the problem of telling when cancer begins is never only a problem for doctors. In the age of the clinic and its epistemology, we are drawn to imagine our insides as places where light can be shone and order restored. When our expectations are thwarted, reassurance is not easy to accept. The telling and the imagining both produce cancer even when no biological tumor exists. This entry from a blog about the hypochondria of its writer, "Leila V.," demonstrates the very real effects of this imagining. "I've mentioned before," she says, "that the birth of my hypochondria was spurred almost nine years ago when a rare, soupy tumor was found residing in the left frontal lobe of my younger brother's brain. ... I did what any rational person would do. ... I too 'developed' a 'brain tumor.' And as my brother went under the knife, I went through the CAT Scan. And as his tumor shrunk through radiation, I was informed mine never existed" (V., Leila). The "birth" of a different kind of illness - intractable anxiety about having or developing an organic disease - emerges from the diagnosis of a brain tumor in the body of another, a sibling. Leila is being partly ironic when she states that "any ra- tional person" would respond in the same way she has. The scare quotes around "developed" and "brain tumor" make this clear, suggesting that she has done some- thing different; she has fabricated, perhaps, the simulacrum of a brain tumor. But the irony is not necessarily untrue. To learn that cancer resides in a body to which one is so close is surely also to imagine the inside of one's own body in a new way. To be told then that no tumor ever existed may produce an imaginary cancer less treatable than a tumor. This "cancer" may well be a frequent side effect of cancer screening and false positives. This, too, is a kind of oncogenesis. The malfunction-signifying "dys-appearance" of the inner body, as Drew Leder describes it, can emerge in response to imagined malfunctions, for these</page><page sequence="17">Narrating Oncogenesis 245 imaginings are what predispose us to "cancer," if not at the cellular level, then in the reading of our bodies as cancerous (or at least in some way diseased). And while we are wrong to see Leila's experience as equivalent to her brother's, of surgery and ra- diation (and perhaps death), we must not disregard the suffering that she (and her family) underwent as her doctors treated her, as they had to, "as if" she too had a tumor in her brain. Leila does not, to her or our knowledge, have a brain tumor at the time of writing, yet imaginary as the cancer might be, the experience she de- scribes (more than once in her blog) as brain tumor patient, and the nine years of fear that have followed, are real. A decade after publishing One Renegade Cell, Robert Weinberg writes in a medical journal about his desire to purify cancer biology of the multiple specifici- ties that make "cancer" so deceptive a singular noun. If medicine could only estab- lish what he and his co-author call in their title "Rules for Making Human Tumor Cells," then the "science of cancer pathogenesis may one day become the study of a coherent set of rules and principles, rather than a phenomenology of unlimited com- plexity" (Hahn 1595). What they imagine is, in effect, what Foucault might have considered a post-clinical cancer, understood as a rule-based process identified not by its emergence in any particular organ or at any site in a body's geography, but by its dispersal, throughout all living cells, as one generative possibility among many. We would need to invent new patient narratives, fundamentally postmodern ones, to tell about such cancer. For now, though, biological science, public health, and popular culture must all rely on imagining our internal geography as a human and habitable place in order to tell when cancer begins. It originates without purpose or meaning in a space we contain but do not inhabit. Yet we need retrospectively to identify a point of origin and a cause for that inhuman beginning in order to recuperate it into our narrations and prospectively change its status as a beginning, to make of it a false start, a non-story. Medicine's work, then, is the storying - the emplotment and nar- ration - of the inaccessible body. It translates inhuman events into a scale and form we can apprehend, if not always understand. Although the scale of such accounts is human and their form narrative, the bodily space where cancer starts to grow is nei- ther. To tell it as such, as biology and screening and medical fiction do, may some- times be therapeutic, even curative, but it is never entirely benign. ENDNOTES 1. The belatedness of the narrative beginning, necessarily after the beginning of disease, can be ob- served in virtually all disease narratives. A few examples concerning brain tumors: the BBC journal- ist Ivan Noble is diagnosed with a high-grade glioma and begins an online diary; the first entry: "Last month I was a healthy young man in my mid-thirties. . . . Now I have just been told that I have a fast- growing tumour inside my brain." Noble's description of himself as "healthy" before diagnosis refers not to the material substance of his brain but to his subjective experience of himself. The very pre- cisely dated beginning of Noble's cancer narrative is not the same as the beginning of his cancer, in relation to which this story begins in medias res. John Gunther's 1949 memoir about the death of his son begins "Johnny came home for the Christmas holiday in 1945, and he looked fit and fine" (25).</page><page sequence="18">246 Catherine Belling This sentence must, in order to open the story of the boy's brain tumor, carry its own implicit contra- diction. Johnny may have looked healthy, but just a few days later, he would develop the tumor's first symptom. 2. For instance, Christina Middlebrook's breast cancer memoir begins only after she has recovered from a bout of chemotherapy, but the opening of the book is not, as Middlebrook herself points out, the be- ginning of her story of cancer. In the fourth chapter she dismissively recapitulates this more conven- tional opening: "My recollections of the beginning are scant. Summer 1991 was the lump, aspiration, biopsy, surgery, pathology report, scans, GM-CSF, chemo. In the fall, the Braves and Twins were in their last-to-first World Series" (32). 3. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih 1 /cancer/guide/understanding 1 .htm (accessed May 26, 2009). 4. This is the subtitle of the 1998 British hardcover edition. The US edition is instead subtitled simply How Cancer Begins. It is tempting to speculate about an authorial revelation about the difference be- tween origin and beginning, but I suspect the change may have more to do with avoiding confusion with Weinberg's earlier book on biology and cancer, Racing to the Beginning of the Road: The Search for the Origin of Cancer (New York: Harmony, 1996).
