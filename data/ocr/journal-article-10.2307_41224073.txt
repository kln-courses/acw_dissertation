Steimer-Herbet, J-F. Saliège, T. Sagory, O. Lavigne &amp; A. as-Saqqaf, IN COLLABORATION WITH M. MASHKOUR &amp; H. GUY1 Summary In November 2005, the French team directed by T. Steimer-Herbet excavated a stone structure at the centre of the village of Rawk, on the east bank of Wadi 'Idim (Hatframawt). A major part of the site had already been destroyed by a modern cowshed and by the sayl of a sha'b (non-perennial stream). Despite this, the villagers discovered three anthropomorphic statues in 1989 and another in 2004. The director of the Seiyun Museum, A. as-Saqqaf, and A. Sedov (from the Russian Academy of Sciences), published the first three statues. The discovery of a fourth one led A. as-Saqqaf to suggest to the French Jawf-Hadramawt expedi- tion that an excavation was necessary. The shape of the structure is still unclear - only five upright stones were preserved - but its function as a cultic place is now supported by evidence. A fifth statue was found in situ and was associated with the skulls of an adult and of two children, as well as with a number of hearths. C14 dates provided by J-F. Saliège have established the chrono- logical span of the site, which dates from the end of the fourth millennium ВС. Ten other anthropomorphic statues were found in Yemen, but none was discovered in an archaeological context. Excavation at Rawk has yielded dates and new data on religious beliefs related to the "cult of ancestors" in Yemen. Keywords: anthropomorphic statue, metal objects, fourth millennium ВС, Yemen Introduction2 In 1989, the erosion caused by the overflowing of a sea- sonal riverbed (sha'b) at Rawk revealed three anthro- pomorphic statuettes placed between two upright stones, henceforth referred to as statues 01-03 (Sedov &amp; as- Saqqaf 1992: 125-129). In 2004, the inhabitants of the same village discovered a fourth statuette at the same location (statue 04). The director of the Seiyun Museum then authorized the French Jawf-Hadramawt expedition3 to study the site. The expedition revealed the presence of further standing stones that together made up a dis- crete structure that contained statuettes (01, 02, 03, and 04). Apart from a votive deposit (statuette 05), a rescue excavation also unearthed a set of grave goods. A men- hir-type statue was discovered in secondary context in the village. In order to gain a more complete insight of the ar- chaeological context, the expedition also carried out a survey of neighbouring terraces on which tombs con- structed of fieldstones had been built in antiquity. Description of the site and stone structure The village of Rawk is located in Wadi 'Idim (Figs 1 and 2), approximately 20 km from the confluence with Wadi Masila. It lies at the very foot of the Jôl limestone plateau. The excavated construction is situated in the middle of the modern village. It is an incomplete struc- ture (Figs 3 and 4) whose western part is missing. The latter has been scraped by the sayls (seasonal water- courses) of a small sha Ъ. As for the western part, sev- eral soundings show the foundations of a stable built in the 1970s. The remains consist of five upright stones (PI to P5) (see Fig. 5) and four slabs, superimposed in pairs (Dl to D4). The five stones are all in situ although PI was con- solidated in the past and the south-western corner of its base was subsequently propped up. The upright stones (numbered 1 to 5 from south to north) all roughly follow this axis. Stones PI and P2 were almost parallel and 1 m apart. P2 was set at a right angle with respect to the three other pillars (P3 to P5). Their top parts are all rounded, except for P3, which was undoubtedly dam- aged when the stable was built.4 The lower parts of the stones that have been unseated (PI and P2) show a</page><page sequence="2">282 T.

The pairs of slabs (Dl to D4) form a bench and are located to the west of P4 and P5, approximately 20 cm away from the latter. The space between was filled with fragments of thin slabs set vertically. The rounded upper shape of the upright stones may be man-made. However, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine whether the tools used were driven by manual or hammer-hit percussion. The setting of the upright stones was a collective undertaking in- volving at least five or six people, judging by our own efforts. Their positioning would have been carried out without any "sophisticated" tools, such as levers, again as successfully experimented by us. The slabs in front of the three upright stones (P3, P4, P5) belong to another category and were set in a quite different fashion. These objects were chosen and selected according to their</page><page sequence="3">Rites and funerary practices at Rawk during the fourth millennium ВС 283 FIGURE 2.

Their positioning and final setting were carried out with par- ticular care: they were all - within a 2 mm margin - at the same level, just like Dl. We have a set of exam- ples consisting of a few items showing simultaneously the product of sheer force (the upright stones) and the results of "fine" precision work (the bench). The upright stones (orthostats) and the slabs indicate the variety of working techniques these ancient people were capable of using. Excavation As the monument was badly preserved, ten soundings were carried out near the two remaining upright stones to determine the extension of the structure. Among the most productive ones were soundings L and N, which yielded the structure's southern limits. Soundings A, B, and С revealed the modern remains of a stable whose stone foundations were the only surviving remains. Only soundings I and J reached levels undisturbed by modern features. The structure was built on a ground sloping slightly from east to west, on a yellowish sedi- mentary layer with a limestone matrix (called the sandy interface). Over this interface sixth-millennium ВС oc- cupation levels were discovered, appearing in the form of three ashy pockets or fills which, in soundings B, I, and J have been sampled and dated (see J-F. Saliège's contribution for an explanation of the dating methods). The setting of the structure's orthostats took place only 2300 years later. Both these upright stones and the slabs were inserted and stuck in a layer of very hard soil con- sisting of a mix of rounded pebbles and ashy inclusions. This sandy and gravelly matrix is the product of water run-off from nearby slopes. Its compact nature hindered excavation. Against the foot of PI, in the fill (i.e. 10 cm above the base of PI), several fragments of an adult's skull (aged 16-30 years and probably belonging to a woman), and the almost complete skeleton of a child (between 6 months and 1 year old) were discovered.6 These bones were associated with a small bone pendant, an obsidian flake, a knapped flint, a small core, and an anthropomorphic statuette (no. 5) set vertically with its face looking towards the south-west. A few centimetres away from the base of P2 the lower molar of a bovid was found.7 To the west of P4 on slab D 1, lay a flint flake and two pottery sherds that could be fitted to- gether. A copper fragment of unidentifiable shape (1 1.6 x 7.58 mm) was found under D3. To the west of the bench, on the sandy interface, a skull and some bone fragments (part of a collarbone) belonging to a newborn baby (aged 0 to 4 months) had been laid to rest.

An unstable reddish deposit was visible on some parts of the skull. Stone statuettes: context, typology, and interpretation In situ finds The fifth statuette (05) (Fig. 6) was discovered during these latest excavations. It is made of yellow granite,8 without any traces of polishing or painted decoration (H. 209, L. 95, W. 90 mm). It was placed vertically in the sandy and gravelly matrix. The head is rounded and the face, whose features are very faint, is not symmetri- cal and gazes slightly towards the left. The nose is straight and thick. The mouth and eyes are not shown. The shoulders are not symmetrical, the left one being slightly higher and more rounded. The right shoulder is flattened and seems to have been badly carved. In the middle part of the body, the arms form a right angle, but are not identical in length. The hands end in stumps and are free from the body. The bottom part of the body ends in a rounded base and is devoid of decoration. The general shape and the details do not reflect the use of a geometrical grid or even of a preconceived plan. None of the shapes is regular. Several factors argue in favour of the statuette's unfinished character. Thus, below the arms, the carving reveals, in its entire central part, a rougher shaping: this is an indication that the work was stopped at this level during the initial stage, when the general shape was outlined. The upper part is character- ized by much finer strikes with a stone tool. The hy- pothesis of an unfinished work is strengthened by other clues. The arms are not incised or strongly outlined by engraving, as are other examples that we were able to study in the Seiyun Museum. Moreover the absence of a mouth and eyes are significant: these were finer features made during the final stages of carving. The lack of any decoration on the bottom half of the body, and the pres- ence of a rounded (rather than a worked flat) base adds further credence to this argument. Finds from unspecified contexts We have been able to re-examine two of the small stat- ues (Fig. 7) discovered by the inhabitants of Rawk and kept in the Seiyun Museum (ST 02 and 04).9 Statuette 02 is made of hard and fine-grained limestone (H. 317 mm, W. 132 mm, T. 55 mm). Its general shape is that of a trapeze, and the top of the head is flattened. The long face is marked by fine striations, all slightly parallel. The nose is straightened and quite large. The eyes ap- pear as depressions and the mouth as a line visible only when slightly illuminated from the sides. Under the chin, a slight depression is visible, representing an al- most pointed goatee beard. The shoulders are round and</page><page sequence="6">286 T. Steimer-Herbet et al FIGURE 7.

Photographs of statuette 04 (T. Sagory). symmetrical. In the middle part, the arms form a right angle and end in stumps. A belt with two bands was carved in the lower part. The base is massive and rec- tangular in shape. This statuette was not thoroughly cleaned and we were able to note the undeniable presence of strong red pigments spread over the artefacťs entire surface (ex- cept the head). This coloration seems to have been in- tentional. Dark residual deposits10 were essentially de- tected only on the frontal part of the object, near the elbows, the arms, and at the level of the belt buckle. The artefact was made without any preliminary preparation work. The statuette's general appearance is that of a polished object, its manufacture is quite elabo- rate and its fineness of grain makes it an item worthy of analysis. Three types of tools were used: firstly an abra- sive (a piece of sandstone, or wood with sand)11 was applied in order to create hollows; then a sharpened object, doubtless a stone tool; and finally, a small metal implement. Statuette 04 (Figs. 7-8) was carved in white greyish granite veined with black (H. 262 mm, W. 144 mm, T. 43 mm). This stone is not local. The object was made from a tabular stone without side faces (i.e. that was almost totally polished and flattened). The head is in the shape of a trapeze and its top part is slightly flattened. The eyes are shown as hollows and the nose is straight and wide. The mouth appears as a fine line. The elon- gated face ends in a little pointed goatee beard. The chin is not emphasized because of the goatee. The arms form a straight angle and end in stumps. The statuette's lower part was covered by a belt with only a single band and an ovoid buckle. Moreover, in the basal part of the sculpture a series of incisions was recorded: a square (21.3 mm wide) and a vertical line of identical length. The statuette's base is rectangular and well propor- tioned, just like the other parts of the object. In the low- est part some minute traces of red pigment were found. One can observe in all of the statuettes' cracks and hol- lows traces of blackened residue; this is less obvious on the back. Facial features were either drawn or outlined with the use of a very fine abrasive, which could imply that a pointed metal tool was used. These traces are clearly visible on the oval of the face. In the middle part of the statue, the inside of the elbows has been badly executed. While attempting to carve a sharp angle, the implement met an obstacle and penetrated inside the stone. Under</page><page sequence="8">288 T. Steimer-Herbet et al FIGURE 9. Drawing of the menhir-type statue (О. Lavigne, T. Sagory). the right arm there were characteristic traces of a metal tool used with an abrasive material such as sand. This tool was used to carve the part of the statuette between the elbow and the stump; it had a working surface of 0.8 mm. The buckle and the incisions were created with the same type of tool, and the buckle itself was completed using a very fine abrasive. A menhir-type statue (Fig. 9) was reused in order to build a wall protecting modern public toilets. The dis- tance between this stone and the excavated site (less than 20 m) and certain iconographie parallels make this a unique item among the site's finds. The menhir-type statue was carved in a soft and fine-grained limestone, a material particularly appropriate for the precise render- ing of human features and details of costume, especially the dagger and its scabbard/sheath. The stone is rounded in its upper part. As regards the iconography, the upper part, partly</page><page sequence="9">Rites and funerary practices at Rawk during the fourth millennium ВС 289 buried under modern mortar, is difficult to describe and interpret. One can nevertheless distinguish the rounded shape of the shoulders, which join in the middle part and touch a slightly off-axis motif (perhaps representing a pointed beard). A pendant is visible underneath, and consists of seven beads, all circumscribed within an oval. Only the right arm is preserved but it is not adorned with a bracelet. It ends in a hand where five fingers were presumably incised. The scabbard to the left is decorated with oblique incisions and the weapon's hilt is visible. The dagger with antennas and its triangu- lar blade is quite evident and fills the entire width of the stone. Its details are drawn with much care. It is the only part carved in the round and softened with abrasive, as all the other parts of the statue were made by striking the stone with a sharp tool. Traces of a red pigment have also been found. Discussion of the materials and stone-working tech- niques Particular attention was given in antiquity to the choice of materials and to the carving techniques. In Wadi 'Idim, and especially around Rawk, different kinds of rocks can be observed. The first type is a cold lime- stone, light grey in colour, often described as "Ville- bois" limestone (the name comes from a village of the Ain region in eastern France). Its mean density is 2656 kg/m3 and its hardness lies between 1 1 and 14 on Noel's scale (1965: 136). This rock is often detached from sur- rounding cliffs, where it can be found in the shape of slabs whose thickness tends to vary between с 20 and 40 cm. In the wadi, an overwhelming majority of boul- ders are made of this material, as are the monument's upright stones. The second type is a hard, non- metamorphic limestone, creamy white in colour with small dark grey spots, which is very hard to scratch with a fingernail. On site one can find small slabs not ex- ceeding 6-7 cm in thickness. It seems that this mineral is to be found in the upper parts of the cliffs around Wadi 'Idim. One of the statuettes (02) discovered in 1989 is made of this type of rock, as are the menhir-type sculptures found in the village and the slabs forming the bench. Embedded in the rock are a few small fossils, and there are also visible inclusions of crystallized cal- cite included between layers forming very thin veins. Reddish flows sometimes appear on some interfaces (iron oxides, ochre?), of a colour identical to the traces of pigments recorded on the statuette (02), on the in- fant's skull, and on the menhir statue. A study of the technical stages involved in carving was possible by closely observing the three statues de- scribed above (02, 04 and 05). Stone cutters used a vari- ety of techniques: the general shape was carved in the round, while details were engraved. The belt, arms, and shape of the head were all subjected to further refine- ments. Two kinds of tools were used, those made with direct manual percussion and those hit with a hammer. Judging from the different rocks selected for the making of the statuettes (granite for 01, 03, 04 and 05, limestone for 02), the use of metal tools for the rendering of de- tails is not unlikely. It appears that these tools were handled and applied without any percussion, but through friction and rubbing, as if an abrasive had been used. In general, the objects' surfaces were softened by using a relatively coarse abrasive (sand?), whose traces are clearly visible on statuette 02. These are neverthe- less totally absent from statuette 05. The impressions resulting from the study of three of the five statuettes from Rawk is one of real and individ- ual technicalities characterizing each piece of sculpture. Statuette 02 is a copy of 04 made by an apprentice or an unskilled stone cutter, who did not use the same set of techniques as the one who made statuette 04, which is the product of more elaborate, complex, and successful work. The most probable hypothesis is that one of the statuettes was imported, and the other was copied lo- cally. Human representations and anthropomorphic statu- ettes are quite rare in the Near and Middle East. In Yemen, ten statuettes belonging to this category have been discovered, one in the Hawlan region (de Maigret 2002), four in the Jawf and two in Marib (Robin ed. 1997: 34-38; Audouin 2005) and three others of un- known provenance (Newton &amp; Zarins 2000: fig. 10).12 All were from illicit excavations or from surface collec- tions. They have been attributed to the third millennium ВС on the basis of comparisons with a human stone carving from the surface of Bani Sulayh, a Bronze Age settlement in the Hawlan. One of the statuettes shows common features (both iconographie and technical) with a large piece of stonework from the island of Tarut in Saudi Arabia. P. Collins (2003: 323) describes a male represented with a three-banded belt or girdle. The statuette's nose is broken, but the ears are prominent. The shoulders are symmetrical and the forearms are raised. Found outside any proper archaeological context, the statue was also dated through comparisons with ex- amples from Mesopotamia belonging to the mid-third millennium ВС.13</page><page sequence="10">290 T.

Saliège Figure 10 is a presentation of C14 dates from the site. The two samples of charcoal, of sizes not exceeding 1 mm, are of good quality and contain enough carbon matter (Pa 2384 and Pa 2388). However, two others taken from a spread contained in ash layers (Pa 2389 and Pa 2394) were harder to isolate from contamination. It was necessary to separate the charcoal from the ashy earth by using the process of differential flotation. In the laboratory, the charcoal was subjected to a series of pre- liminary processes so as to, on the one hand, dissolve carbonates (treatment with acid), and on the other, to transform organic acids into a solution (treatment with alkalis). The human skull had lost its collagen matter, some- thing quite predictable considering the climate in Yemen. This led us to date bio-apatite crystals. Use of these molecules for dating implies a preliminary elimi- nation of secondary calcite from HCO3~ and CO3" ions present in the natural environment. The bone is cor- roded because of diluted acetic acid present in an air vacuum, which allows the efficient elimination of sec- ondary calcite and absorbed ions. The original aspect of our preliminary process consists in enabling this purifi- cation without any disturbance caused to the crystalline state of bio-apatite. The efficiency of this preliminary treatment is controlled by combining both crystalline state and balance in terms of mass and stable carbon isotopes, both before and after corrosion by acetic acid (Baiter tí al 2002). The various studies carried out in the last ten years or so in arid and semi-arid tropical areas show that the difficult problem posed by isotopie exchange of carbon and oxygen, between total inorganic carbon dissolved in the environment on the one hand, and the crystalline matrix (Hedges, Lee-Thorp &amp; Tuross 1995; Wright &amp; Schwarcz 1996) on the other, was in fact a negligible factor during the entire Holocene (Saliège, Person &amp; Paris 1995; Lukacs, Pal &amp; Misra 1998). Moreover the study of stable carbon isotopes (813C %o, -5.45 %o PDB) supports the idea of a contribution to tropical networks of C4 graminae. The systematic study of carbon iso- topes originating from the bio-apatite crystals and not from the collagen of Yemeni bones should, in the fu- ture, allow us to study ancient diet. Interpretation of the structure There are very few elements of the structure left, a fact that does not help in its interpretation. However, two types of inhumation are present: secondary for the adult's skull and primary for the newborn baby and the child. These reflect very different funerary traditions, since secondary inhumation obviously implies two stages, i.e. the treatment and disposal of the body and the selection of certain bones. In this instance the differ- ence in treatment of individuals is a function of age; the child and the newborn baby were buried directly, while the adult's skull was the product of deliberate selection. The adult's bones and those of the child contributed to the monument's construction. The earth deposit in which they were found was used to keep PI in place and stabilize it. As for the baby's skull, if one looks at the absolute height of the bench's slabs D3 and D4, one can determine that it was clearly found much lower. Statu- ette 05, moreover, was found standing without any bonding or supporting elements. Its rounded base sup- poses that it was held upright with soil. Funerary depos- its, like cultic offerings, are part of the monument's foundations. The total abrasion and erosion of the upper part have, in all likelihood, caused the disappearance of the original floor. The latter would have been level, con- tiguous, and contemporary with the lower part of the bench; the preserved part of the building therefore con- sists only of a rectilinear wall belonging to a large struc- ture, within which stood two upright stones. The adult and child's bones in the immediate prox- imity of statuette 05 have yielded C14 dates of 3499- 3198 ВС - one standard deviation (1 o, Pa 2392). To this day no excavated sites of the fourth millennium are</page><page sequence="11">Rites and funerary practices at Rawk during the fourth millennium ВС 29 1 attested in Yemen. We have thus been obliged to seek parallels from geographically distant areas. The rare published examples of skulls associated with upright stones in funerary contexts are to be found in the Negev (Eilat, Muyat Galla, Wadi Zalaqa, and Kfar Hahoresh) (Avner 1984; 2001; 2002) and at Risqueh in Jordan (Kirkbride 1969). At Eilat, the circu- lar tomb possesses two standing stones in its centre, one of which is anthropomorphic. At the foot of the latter a deposit of six skulls was discovered. The construction was dated to the sixth to fifth millennium ВС. At Risqueh, D. Kirkbride discovered a sanctuary of sorts containing menhir-type statues associated with circular or rectangular graves. The only date (4060 ВС; К1467, 6010 ± 120 BP) (Kirkbride 1969: 195) was given by a charcoal sample from a large circle located at the centre of the site. In Yemen, the constructions most reminis- cent of Rawk are those of the "public space, ritual space" type described by A. de Maigret (2002: 145, pl. 10) in the al-A'rush region of the Hawlan. These are rectangular in shape, with walls made of monoliths set upright and slightly rounded in their upper part. Benches of sorts made of flat stones were found inside along three walls. For construction L14 the archaeolo- gist describes four monoliths or baetyls without any iconography, set in an upright position (de Maigret 1990: 66, 214, fig. 30). Excavation of this building un- covered a substantial mass of animal bone (de Maigret 2002: 155). Constructions of this type have been attrib- uted to the last quarter of the third millennium ВС.14 The originality of the construction at Rawk lies in the fact that in its foundations, it is associated with both a funerary deposit and a group of votive offerings, such as the bovid tooth and the anthropomorphic statuettes. The structure's function as a meeting place is reflected by the presence of a bench and of two upright slabs. A sounding slightly outside the construction (L) unearthed a pocket filled with ash coeval with the monument, a testimony to the ritual activities that must have taken place outside the building. Regional context A quick survey of the lower terraces immediately above the village enabled us to record twenty-nine circular tower graves and two domestic structures. The entire group was distributed within a radius of approximately 1 km. Two types of graves appear quite clearly: those of an average size (2.5 m in diameter, Tl) of modest height (max.l m), and the large tombs (3.5-5 m in diameter and 1.5-2 m in height, T2). Smaller graves only had one course of stones enclosing the circular burial chamber and the external wall, while the larger tombs had walls made of several courses (6-7) of coarse fieldstones and a corbelled roof over the chamber. None of the graves revealed the presence of a door. Only one of the circular tombs (T2) is associated with two piles of stones form- ing small round structures (1 m in diameter and 0.5 m in height); it belongs to a type of grave with peripheral extensions. Two circles, 10.5 and 11.5 m2 in surface, have been recorded near tombs belonging to type 2. These constructions are in a very bad state and were in all likelihood looted in order to build the tombs. Conclusion Monumental constructions of the Bronze Age are rare in Yemen. The Rawk monument appears to be one of the first to be discovered and attributed to the fourth mil- lennium ВС. Even though its preservation is incom- plete, it is a unique building that has yielded important elements of information on burial traditions and modes of funerary deposition (primary and secondary), con- struction techniques (use of megalithic stones as well as of finer masonry), ancient technology (metals, sculp- ture, and pottery), burial offerings placed jointly with the deceased (bovid tooth, statuette, obsidian blade, pendant, and maybe even pigments [?]), and imports into Haçlramawt from the Yemeni highlands, both of objects (statuettes) and of raw materials (granite, obsid- ian). The complexity of funerary ritual associated with the standing stones, as well as the discovery of the group of anthropomorphic statuettes, testify to an elabo- rate system of beliefs of the population of South Arabia in the fourth millennium ВС. Monuments like Rawk are a prelude to the appear- ance on a regional and Arabian scale of a cult of stand- ing stones (baetyls) that occurs from the fourth millen- nium. The most striking examples are the stone align- ments of the Tihamah and the Jawf (Bayle de Hermens 1976; Bernardelli &amp; Parinello 1970; Keall 1998; Pringle 1998), or the alignments of pillbox structures of Jebel Ruwaik and Jebel Jidran, whose functions remain mys- terious to this day. Three sites nevertheless reveal char- acteristics of locations reserved for worship and were discovered in the last ten years. A peculiar monument containing seven pebbles associated with bowls has been discovered in Wadi Tuban (near Aden) by B. Vogt (1997; Vogt &amp; Sedov 1998). In the Hawlan (highlands), A. de Maigret (1990: 66, fig. 30) recorded a rectangular house comprising four standing stones where the con- struction's architectural style differs from that of domes-</page><page sequence="12">292 T. Steimer-Herbet et al tic units. Found within were large quantities of animal bone. Lastly, near Gawat Bintayn Metul (Ramlat as- Sabatayn), D. Pickworth (2005: 418) excavated a rec- tangular structure built with standing stones, inside which a stone figurine was recovered. The emergence of sites with standing stones is re- lated, according to many researchers, to two comple- mentary factors: the gradual adoption of a sedentary way of life heralded by the development of settlements (Sabr, Mihqala), and the need to mark a territory or sa- cred space. In the case of Rawk, the selection of a skull, the presence of male anthropomorphic statuettes as well as the menhir-type statue, are all elements reflecting the presence of a population with complex rituals. Excava- tions and surveys focusing on this period are still very few and preliminary, and have not yet given us a clear idea of the religious atmosphere in the fourth-third mil- lennium ВС and of the populations at the origin of these beliefs. Some elements are nevertheless at our disposal and clearly emphasize a common cultural background. Notes 1 T. Steimer-Herbet, archaeologist, IFPO, Damascus; J-F.
