Konvitz־ I Several days after the death of Morris Raphael Cohen on January 28, 1947, an editorial in The New York Times stated that long before his death Professor Cohen had become "an almost legendary figure in American philosophy, education and the liberal tradition." His wise and scholarly works, the editorial continued, were well known not only to professional philosophers but to lawyers and judges—including Justices Holmes, Brandeis and Cardozo, who were his intimate friends. Professor Cohen also had won renown as a great teacher ; ac cording to the Times, "Several college generations of students at the College of the City of New York'knew him as a contem porary Socrates who asked ruthlessly searching questions and persisted in questioning until he evoked such answers as the rational mind could assent to." But he was a gadfly to more than his students: "He was one of the most celebrated conver sationalists of intellectual circles in our time, at once ironical and genial. He was, through his students, many of them in positions of major importance in law, industry, education and government, a deep and wide influence on American life." The editorial noted two special qualities by which one might measure the nature of Professor Cohen,s philosophical temper and achievements; namely, "the wide human range of his learning and interests, and his concern for precision and intellectual rigor .... He insisted on the necessity and the possibility of a rational discovery of the principles implicit in human existence and experience. He was a liberal in his warm and wide sympathies and his awareness of human tragedy in our time, but he was never taken in by sentimental or fanatic cliches. He was as critical of the rigidities and the emotionalisms of the left as he was of the right." 49</page><page sequence="3">50 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Philosophy was to Professor Cohen a way of life, a guard against prejudices, and "a consolation of steady insight and understanding in a world of the precarious and the disas trous .... He will live not only as a philosopher but as an example of a typically American achievement. Morris R. Cohen, an immigrant boy, through his own genius and through public education, became a leader in American thought and life." II Born in Minsk, Russia, on July 25, 1880, Morris Raphael Cohen received the traditional education of an Orthodox Jewish boy in eastern Europe. When he was twelve his parents brought him to the United States. Eight years later he received his bachelor's degree from the College of the City of New York through which he had worked his way by doing various jobs, including those of newsboy and poolroom attendant. Six years afterward Cohen was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Harvard University where he had studied under William James and Josiah Royce. Shortly before, and for several years after the turn of the century, Cohen taught at the Educational Alliance on New York's East Side, and at the Davidson Collegiate Institute, a school directed by Rabbi David Davidson. In 1899 Cohen met Thomas Davidson, founder of the Fabian Society, the Fellow ship of the New Life and the Aristotelian Society. In later years Cohen said that Davidson had greatly stimulated him intellectually and spiritually. In 1902 Morris Cohen began to teach mathematics at City College, an assignment in which he continued for almost ten years. He was not happy teaching mathematics, although his interest in the subject was very keen. It was a study of mathe matical philosophy, especially Bertrand Russell's Principles of Mathematics,Mathematics, he said, which liberated him "from the feeling of helpless philosophic bewilderment" and enabled him "to undertake an independent journey." Cohen's first love was philosophy. He felt it had been awakened in him in his early years by his grandfather, a poor tailor in the Russian town of Nesviesh. "Though he never</page><page sequence="4">MORRIS R. COHEN 51 learned to write and had only a moderate reading knowledge of Hebrew,יי Morris Cohen wrote, "he had become the master of an extraordinary amount of knowledge and wisdom. Walks and talks with him first stimulated my imagination about the world at large and its history. From him, also, I acquired a certain ineradicable admiration for the ascetic virtues and a scorn for the life of wealth, ease, creature comforts and all that goes under the old name of worldliness." To Morris Cohen to philosophize seemed "as natural and desirable in itself as to sing, to dance, to paint, or mould, or to commune with those we love.יי The opportunity to teach his favorite subject came to him in 1912 when he was ap pointed assistant professor of philosophy at City College. This meant to him "the end of a long valley of humiliation. I had labored for six years with the Leah of mathematics yearning for the Rachel of philosophy." For twenty-six years Cohen taught philosophy to thousands of students at City College. It was not until seven years before he retired from his position at City College in 1938 that Reason Reason and Nature, his major work, was published; yet for a quarter of a century his name had been known throughout the length and breadth of the country wherever men were devoted to a pursuit of wisdom. This was, indeed, a remark able achievement, matched in recent times only by the reputa tion of Felix Frankfurter; for the renown of each was due chiefly to the opinion and devotion of thousands of students. Cohen made no effort to acquire disciples. He conceived it as his duty as a teacher to be the critic rather than the prophet or the system-builder. This position exposed him to the charge of being "merely critical, negative, or destructive. י י "I have always been ready,יי he said, "to plead guilty to that charge.יי He considered it an important service "in the cause of liberal civilization to develop a spirit of genuine regard for the weight of evidence, to inculcate the habit of admitting ignorance when we do not know and to nourish the critical spirit of inquiry which is inseparable from the love of truth that makes men free.יי He once said to a student who re proached him for his destructive criticism: "You have heard the story of how Hercules cleaned the Augean stables. He</page><page sequence="5">52 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK took all the dirt and manure out and left them clean. You ask me: 'What did he leave in their stead?' I answer: 'Isn't it enough to have cleaned the stables?' " Morris Cohen challenged accepted dogmas, fashionable opinions, uncritical acceptance of beliefs and views, no matter by what authority they were supported. He compelled his students—future physicians, lawyers and teachers—to think critically about the problems they would face as specialists and as citizens. He wanted to make of his students respon sible thinkers, not disciples. Some of his students became eminent philosophers in their own right. They include Ernest Nagel and Herbert W. Schneider of Columbia University, Sidney Hook of New York University and Paul Weiss of Yale University. Morris Raphael Cohen's family life was rich in sentiment and love. Mary Ryshpan, whom he married in 1906, died in 1942. In his wife, two sons and a daughter, Cohen found society almost enough for his needs; in addition he enjoyed the close friendship of men like Justices Holmes, Brandeis, Cardozo and Frankfurter; Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Arthur S. Meyer, A. A. Himwich, Harold J. Laski, John Dewey, Irwin Edman, Alvin Johnson and Huntington Cairns. Despite his physical frailties, Morris Cohen pushed himself hard, worked constantly on his lectures, articles and books. In 1923 he edited a collection of Charles S. Peirce's philosophical essays under the title, Chance, Love and Logic. Before he retired from teaching in 1938 he had published Reason and Nature (1931), Law and the Social Order (1933) and, with Ernest Nagel, An An An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method (1934). Cohen had plans for ten other books—a volume on meta physics, a treatise on law, a book on logic, a statement of his philosophy of liberalism, •a volume on the will to illusion, an introduction to philosophy, a volume on Jewish problems, a philosophy of history, a history of science and a study of the development of American thought. However, he felt that he would not be strong enough to accomplish this program if he continued to teach, so in January, 1938, he retired from active teaching at City College—the institution with which he had been intimately associated since 1895.</page><page sequence="6">MORRIS R. COHEN 53 By the time of Cohen,s death in 1947, at the age of sixty six, he had seen two more of his books appear in print: A Preface Preface to Logic (1944) and The Faith of a Liberal (1946). The first was dedicated to City College and its students "who gave zest to my life." Cohen also was able to write some of the ten books he had planned. To be published posthumously they are: The Meaning of History; Reflections of a Wandering Jew;Jew; A Dreamer's Journey: an Autobiography; Studies in Philosophy and and Science; Studies in Juristic Philosophy; and Currents of American Thought.Thought. In addition there is Source Book in Greek Science, which Cohen had prepared with the collaboration of I. E. Drabkin. His retirement from City College left Cohen with more time to devote to his studies and writing; but he did not give up teaching entirely. He was a visiting professor at Harvard in 1938-39 and at Yale the following year. In 1941 he began preparation of the Carus lectures which he delivered at the University of Chicago in 1945. Ill Morris Raphael Cohen considered himself philosophically "a stray dog unchained to any metaphysical kennel." It seemed to him "better to brave the muddy realities of the unprotected out-of-doors, the uncertain food, the attacks from the watch dogs of comfortable homes, and above all the chill ing rains and winds of factual experience .... I have never become completely at home in even the greatest of academic philosophies.,י Bertrand Russell came closer to being his philosophical god than any other thinker. Cohen said that he was faithful to Russell's fundamental teaching even when Russell strayed from the way. He liked to think of himself as a logician, calling his intellectual autobiography in Contempo raryrary American Philosophy (1930), "The Faith of a Logician." His emphasis on criticism, skepticism and logical analysis led many persons to view Cohen as a philosophical nihilist, a great nay-sayer, an iconoclast, a destroyer of other men's faiths and philosophies, as one who could effectively wreck but not build. This view of Cohen is, however, only partially true. Cohen had the capacity to build and this capacity he</page><page sequence="7">54 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK manifested in his more substantial productions, such as Reason and and Nature, Law and the Social Order and The Faith of a Liberal. A look into Reason and Nature: an Essay on the Meaning of Scientific Scientific Method shows that the book covers a wide range of subjects, disclosing the catholicity and erudition of the author: mathematics, biology, jurisprudence, ethics, the social and physical sciences. From the first page to the last Cohen demon strates his unqualified devotion to impartial reason: "Our reason may be a pitiful candle-light in the dark and boundless seas of being," he says, "but we have nothing better, and woe to those who wilfully try to put it out." Cohen's search for fundamental principles of thought and categories of reality led him to attack empiricism or nomi nalism of the type which admits the existence of only particu lars. Logical or mathematical relations are real; their reality justifies the hypothetical and deductive procedures of science. Scientific inquiry discovers abstract relations which character ize the world of phenomena. The reality of mathematical relations makes possible a "biting into the world." Relativism, nihilism or skepticism fails to disclose the nature of mind or reality. It does not follow from this, however, that a priori rationalism must, therefore, be accepted. An understanding of the logical and hypothetical character of mathematics destroys the ground of any assertion that space must be Euclidean. On the one hand, said Cohen, one sees that the laws or postulates of mathematics or logic are the invariant forms or relations of all possible objects; they are the laws of all possible being but are themselves neither physical nor mental. On the other hand, one sees that from purely formal considerations no material facts are deducible. Science involves logic; on the one hand we see that it is rational, that phenomena conform to laws of logic; on the other hand we see that phenomena involve an element of contingency. The discussion thus far of the laws of logic and the nature of science shows Cohen's adherence to what he called the principle of polarity, which occupied a central place in his thought. There is a polarity of terms and relations; neither is reducible to the other; terms and relations involve one another.</page><page sequence="8">MORRIS R. COHEN 55 Opposites "such as immediacy and mediation, unity and plurality, the fixed and the flux, substance and function, ideal and real, actual and possible,י' all involve each other when applied to any significant entity. This principle of polarity seems to be the central fact of Cohen's metaphysics of science. Polarity is a supplement to the principle of causality; for a natural event must have a cause, but the cause is opposed by some factor which prevents it from producing a greater effect than it actually does; thus protoplasm lives by continually dying. The principle of polar ity applies to social as well as to physical and biological events. In all determination there are opposing categories: unity and plurality, identity and difference, activity and passivity. Thus Cohen's denial of both empiricism and absolutism may be viewed as an instance of the effectiveness of the prin ciple of polarity. He believed that rational structure is a fundamental phase of the world; but he also believed that there is an element of contingency. There is both intelligibility and contingency in the world. Cohen did not always, in the presentation of his argument, keep himself scrupulously neutral between two poles, between the fixed elements in reality and the flux, between the variant and the invariant characters of the world, between unity and plurality, between the ideal and the real or between idealism and naturalism, between reason and nature. His sharpest barbs were directed at those who are romantically attached to immediacy rather than mediation, who are attached to "life" or "experience." There is no intelligible life without the pole star of invariance or identity; the weight and emphasis of his argument seemed to be on the side of intelligibility as opposed to contingency, on the side of idealism as opposed to natural ism, on the side of reason as opposed to nature, status or fixity as opposed to change. It is to be doubted, however, if this disparity in the weights of opposite sides of the scale was more than polemical. When Cohen framed his arguments, empiricism was in the ascendant and idealism was on the defensive. Cohen always distrusted ideas that were fashionable, for they threatened to become the new dogmas, displacing the old. There was more danger that men would adopt the new philosophies as absolutes than that</page><page sequence="9">56 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK they would go back to the discredited faiths. It was, therefore, necessary to fight harder against the new gods, still young and fresh, than against the gods already in the twilight. IV Cohen,s influence on judges and teachers of law can hardly be exaggerated. The weight of his legal philosophy was felt in high courts, including the United States Supreme Court. As a young boy Cohen discovered that the law is chiefly a pattern of life, rather than a set of rules to be memorized and obeyed. The God of the Jews was primarily a law-giver, and Moses was a law teacher. Cohen was exposed to legal studies as soon as he began to study the Old Testament and the Talmud. The law became and remained for him a life-long interest. Law Law Law and the Social Order: Essays in Legal Philosophy consists twenty-five essays published in the twenty years preceding 1933. The book discloses an extensive and penetrating knowl edge of legal philosophy that was equalled in the United States only by Dean Roscoe Pound and probably was un equalled by any British or continental thinker. The book treats of the legal philosophies of de Tourtoulon, Geny, Duguit, Charmont, Demogue, Ihering, Stammler, Kohler, del Vecchio, Pound, Laski, Gray, Jerome Frank, Holmes, Krabbe and others. The book has notable discussions of property and contract; an attack on what he called the "phonograph theory of the judicial function." Even before Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to reorganize the Supreme Court, Cohen had pointed out that the judges of our higher courts generally are elderly gentlemen who in their younger days were successful representatives of the interests of bankers, manufacturers and merchants. But Cohen's sharp criticism of the jurisprudence of concepts did not mean that he joined the camp of the legal realists. Here, too, the principle of polarity came into play: one must give weight to the abstract legal principle and to the concrete case. Cohen was as opposed to legal anarchy or naked "experi ence" in legal phenomena as he was to the legal philosophy that saw only the empty abstract rule or doctrine. There must</page><page sequence="10">MORRIS R. COHEN 57 be both discretion and rule; there is a need for both realism and idealism. In this instance, too, his argument in later years seemed to favor order and reason, rationalism, the unchanging, as against the contingent and the changing. But this emphasis was only polemical; for in legal philosophy, too, nominalism of a radical nature appeared to be in fashion and the old conceptualism was losing favor. Cohen distrusted the new movement; he wanted to expose its more extreme manifesta tions as shallow fads. In his legal philosophy, as in his phi losophy of nature, Cohen was no champion of causes; no partisan advocate. He attacked all false prophets but espe cially those who made the most noise in his day or appeared to attract more devotees than did competing prophets. Cohen attacked those who, like Professor Beard, distrusted the Supreme Court less than Congress. When one considers, he said, the long roll of judicial decisions "such as the Dred Scott Case, the Lochner Case, the Adair Case, the child labor cases, the Coppage case, the minimum wage cases up to 1937, the voiding of Congressional legislation to protect the Negroes against• lynching and the deprivation of civil rights, or the public against being gouged by ticket scalpers, fraudulent bakers, and conscienceless employment agencies, the sadism of the courts will far outweigh that of Congress even though esthetically the procedure of the courts is more refined." Long before it became respectable to mention such things, Cohen argued against the hypocrisy of the legal orthodoxy centered in the axiom that judges declare but do not make law. His interest in the judicial function was first stimulated in the early years of the century by the course of decisions in labor cases. The "arbitrary (and often unenlightened) charac ter" of these decisions revealed to him the inadequacy of the dogma that judges are legal phonographs. Judges are influ enced by economic and social theories and prejudices; and no study of the law should ignore or fail to evaluate economic and social interests and forces. The judicial process has a human aspect. These and similar statements are commonplace today, but early in the century it took courage to make them. When they became commonplace, Cohen began to point to the opposite pole, which was being neglected; namely, that ideal</page><page sequence="11">58 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK ism, tradition and fixity of rule have a necessary and justifiable place in the judicial process. In the early years of his interest in jurisprudence and the philosophy of law, Cohen received intellectual stimulation from American scholars and thinkers like Roscoe Pound, John Dewey and Felix Adler. However, Cohen found his chief inspiration in the writings of continental thinkers. That he studied these writings well and beneficially can be easily seen from a reading of Law and the Social Order. Professional legal scholars soon became aware of Cohen. When the Association of American Law Schools appointed an editorial committee to translate, edit and publish the Mod ern Legal Philosophy Series in 1910, Cohen was made a member of the committee, although he was neither a lawyer nor a teacher of law. In 1913 Cohen organized the Con ference on Legal and Social Philosophy, the chairmanship of which was taken by John Dewey. The Conference held four meetings, each of which attracted outstanding scholars. The meetings stimulated discussion and thought and under scored the need for radical and fresh thinking in legal and social philosophy. The Conference on Legal •and Social Philosophy and the New Republic magazine, founded in 1914, were forums from which Cohen,s influence effectively ema nated. Holmes and Cardozo, Brandeis and Frankfurter, Learned Hand, Roscoe Pound and Harold Laski, American courts, philosophers and men of public affairs felt and re sponded to that influence. V "Like science, liberalism insists on a critical examination of the content of all our beliefs, principles, or initial hypotheses," Cohen said, "and on subjecting them to a continuous process of verification so that they will be progressively better founded in experience and reason.י' It was socialism, he said, that offered the specific occasion for his entering upon a study of technical philosophy, for socialism seemed to him to offer "the only scientific analysis of the economic evils and political corruption of our age as well as of the main course of human history.'ג The 1896 campaign of Bryan stirred in Cohen a deep interest in politics. Cohen was then teaching working</page><page sequence="12">MORRIS R. COHEN 59 men's classes as part of his work for Daniel de Leon's Socialist Labor Party. In 1897 he campaigned for Henry George who ran in the New York mayoralty election. This was also the period during which Cohen belonged to a Marxist study group; and, as a matter of fact, he never ceased to be grateful for the illumination he found in a study of Das Kapital. "It not only helped me to recognize the poverty of most non-economic interpretations of history," he said, "but also prepared me to see that the recurrent breakdowns of capitalist economy are not unforeseeable accidents but a consequence of the private ownership of the machinery of production,.... It helped me to see that the old optimistic but essentially anarchistic notion that the good of all vgill best be promoted by 'rugged individualism,' by each pursuing his own selfish economic gain, is a cruel superstition which men possessed of both reason and a decent amount of human sympathy cannot long maintain in the face of the hideous miseries that flourish in the shadow of men's mighty productive powers." On the other hand, he was repelled by the exaggerated materialism that pervaded Marx's thinking. This materialism was evident at many points in Marxism; it was especially, evident, said Cohen, "in the Marxist boast, which I could not swallow, that Marx never spoke of justice." All his life Cohen maintained an active interest in social problems and social reform. Social injustices aroused his hatred and put him in a fighting mood. He never forgave Roosevelt's imposition of the embargo against the Spanish Republic. Always taking his stand for freedom of thought and inquiry, freedom of discussion and criticism, he opposed Communism and the Russian dictatorship. He did not believe that the "proletarian" dictatorship was necessary as a "tempo rary" expedient. "The plea that the denial of freedom is a temporary necessity is advanced by all militarists. It ignores the fact that, when suppression becomes a habit, it is not readily abandoned .... When the Communists tell me that I must choose between their dictatorship and Fascism, I feel that I am offered the choice between being shot and being hanged. It would be suicide for liberal civilization to accept this as exhausting the field of human possibility."</page><page sequence="13">60 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK In his social philosophy, too, Cohen used the principle of polarity. There must be the principle of order and the prin ciple of freedom; opposing groups must cooperate, for each group must be wise enough "to see the necessity of compro mising with those with whom we have to live together and whom we cannot or do not wish to exterminate'י; not all property should become communal, nor may an individual use his property in antisocial ways. Principles of social aims and policy should not be posited as fixed dogmas; they should be viewed as "provisional hy potheses, to be tried with as much intelligence and persistence as ־we can summon, but never without watching their conse quences to see whether these hypotheses are really confirmed." A fundamental tenet of his liberalism is that an individual may never assume that he has the whole truth in his possession. Moral humility, tolerance, a belief in the scientific method, freedom of speech and inquiry—a faith in these qualities of mind and action was at the heart of his liberalism. He did not believe in the inevitability of progress; with Justice Holmes he said that effort is one of the ways through which the inevitable comes to pass. His philosophy of liberal ism was satisfied with the mere possibility of progress. But this mere possibility is all a man needs to provide the moral strength for his will, to engage in the fight for social reform. No social cause, however, will bring about universal salva tion. The achievement of universal suffrage, popular educa tion or some other end greatly desired brings in its train new disappointments. But despair is not a permanent state of the emotions; new waves of hope arise, and so human history swings between the pole of growth and the pole of decay, between the pole of hope and the pole of despair. Cohen's liberalism stands between these poles: it is not a set of dogmas or doctrines, but a process, a temper of mind. It means an open eye for alternatives, a questioning of all "self-evident" propositions, a faith in enlightenment "yet col ored with a deep humility before the vision of a world so much larger than our human hopes and thoughts"; a readiness for new risks in new situations, "in which there is no guarantee that the new will always be the good or the true, in which progress is a precarious achievement rather than an inevi</page><page sequence="14">MORRIS R. COHEN 61 tability";tability"; a liberation of "the energies of human nature by the free and fearless use of reason." In this social philosophy, as in his philosophy of nature and in his philosophy of law, Cohen saw the operations of the principle of polarity: there is the opening up of new situations with new challenges, but this activity should be the result of disciplined intelligence rather than of arbitrary forces; for social life "involves a balance between the expansive or centrif ugal forces which make for diversity and adventure, and the constraining or centripetal forces which make for organization and safety .... The life of civilization, like the life of each organism, oscillates between opposite extremes." VI Cohen said that piety as defined by Santayana -— "rever ence for the sources of one's being" — is but a necessary corol lary of the Socratic maxim "know thyself." If a Jew is to know himself, he must know the histffry of the Jewish people—in Biblical, Talmudic and recent times. Cohen's interest in Jew ish history began when he was still a young boy subject to the influence of his grandfather and remained a lively one all his life. His essay "Philosophies of Jewish History," in the first number of Jewish Social Studies, is one of the significant fruits of his devotion to this subject. His mother tongue was Yiddish and for this language he always maintained a special love. "No other language," he once admitted, "ever entirely replaced it in the expression of intimate affection." He owed a great deal of his education, he said, to the Yiddish press: "It taught me to look at world news from a cosmopolitan instead of a local or provincial point of view, and it taught me to interpret politics realistically, instead of being misled by empty phrases." The first language Cohen learned to read was Hebrew. Up to the time of his bar mitzvah his life conformed to the tenets of orthodox Judaism; after that he gave up a belief in a per sonal God, and at the age of nineteen discontinued the ortho dox observances. Later he rejected monotheism—and all other forms of theism—on philosophical grounds, for he was not able to reconcile the reality of evil with the idea of a benevolent</page><page sequence="15">62 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK and omnipotent deity. Nor was he able to understand, he said, any theism that was not anthropomorphic, and "making a God in man's image has always seemed to me the height of arrogance." Nor did he accept Zionism. "I should like to see Palestine, and all its inhabitants, grow in wealth," he said. "I have the deepest admiration for the brave and wise efforts through which Jewish pioneers have rescued the soil of Israel from centuries of neglect and abuse. I should like to see the racial or religious discriminations with which the British exclude Jewish immigrants and restrict Jewish land ownership broken, just as I should like to see similar discriminations in our own land broken. I should, above all, like to see the Hebrew University become a beacon of light throughout the world." A politically-Zionist Palestine, Cohen felt, would not have free non-Jewish immigration. It would be a state founded on a peculiar race or people, a tribal religion, and a mystic belief in a peculiar soil; there would be no separation of church and state, no free mixing of races or peoples. "Tribalism," he said, "is a creed that leads to grief and massacre, whether it bears the label of Zionism, Aryanism, Anglo-Saxon America, or Pan-Islam." The fine achievements of the halutzim did not, he said, presuppose the establishment of a Jewish state, "and I trust that they may be advanced and extended in years to come within the framework of a nonsectarian state that allows equal rights to all—Jews, Christians, Mohammedans and atheists alike." In any case, he believed, Zionism distracted the minds of American Jews from the solution of domestic problems. "To my way of thinking," he said, "the realities before us here and now, where our practical efforts are likely to be most effective, are actual human beings, boys and girls who are our children, who live here, who must adapt themselves to the conditions of American life, and who want to make their lives fuller and richer. A few of them will go to Palestine and cease to be Americans. A few will stay here and cease to be Jews. But the great majority, for generations to come, will be American Jews and, out of self-respect, will want to make the greatest contributions to American life which their heritage, their training and their individual efforts make possible. For them,</page><page sequence="16">MORRIS R. COHEN 63 as for those of us whose hopes as parents and as teachers are bound up with theirs, the problem remains: what can we, with our age-old heritage, contribute to the fullness of Ameri can life?" Cohen rejected Judaism as a theology; he rejected political Zionism; he also rejected assimilationism. "Jewish young men will continue to fall in love with Jewish young women. The highest rate of intermarriage ever known in the heyday of German liberalism was fourteen per cent. Even if centuries of assimilation in an atmosphere of tolerance were unbroken by waves of anti-Semitism it would probably be eighty genera tions before the Jews would disappear as distinguishable people upon the American scene.'י When Cohen began to teach at City College in 1902, and for thirty-six years thereafter, his students were predominantly Jewish boys. He shared their struggles against the discrimi nation that so many of them faced as they sought to establish themselves in careers. As a citizen he felt he could not be silent "in the face of the great campaign to repudiate the declaration that all men are created equal which culminated in the racist immigration laws of 1922 and 19242' In the early 1920's alongside his wife, Mary Ryshpan Cohen, he became active in the vocational training work of the ORT. Later, in 1939, he became president of the Jewish Occupa tional Council. These affiliations should not suggest that Cohen believed that Jews should seek careers and employment in which their "visibility" in public life would be relatively small and thus points of irritation leading to anti-Semitism would be reduced in number. Why should Americans object to Norwegian immigrants, who possess a maritime tradition, supplying more than their proportionate numbers to American shipping? "If the traditional Jewish love of learning is of value to a liberal civilization, is it not better for the Jews to maintain it, and perhaps transmit it to other portions of the population, rather than retreat from it as a source of danger?" When Cohen heard of the pogroms in Czarist Russia and later of the massacres by the Nazis, it was natural for him to recognize that, but for the good luck and fortitude of his parents, he and those dearest to him might have been among the victims. He always sought for ways to identify himself with</page><page sequence="17">64 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK fellow Jews and not to let differences in religious belief or politics stand in the way of practical cooperation. Believing in division of labor, he felt that he could best make his contri bution by concentrating on scientific pursuits. In the fight against injustice and cruelty, facts and an understanding of facts are necessary, useful weapons. Cohen, therefore, in 1933, organized the Conference on Jewish Relations with which he was closely identified until his death. Not long afterward Cohen took a leading role in the establishment of the Jewish Social Studies, a quarterly that has won a distinguished place among learned sociological and Jewish journals. The Conference has pursued and the journal has published detailed scholarly studies of Jewish social, political and economic problems. Motivated by the same spirit of truth-seeking, Cohen became one of the founders and the first chairman of the Research Institute on Peace and Postwar Problems of the American Jewish Committee. VII Although Cohen gave up a belief in a personal God, he did not give up the Jewish "ideal of holiness that enables us to distinguish between the good and evil in men and thus saves us from the idolatrous worship of a humanity that is full of imperfections.'י He might have called this "ideal of holiness" by the name of God, but he did not want to cause confusion or be misunderstood. He never returned to any supernatural beliefs, but if by religion is understood what he called "the realm of ideal expression," Cohen was a religious man. Atheists, he said, are as a rule singularly blind "to the limitations of our knowledge and to the infinite possibilities beyond us. And those who called themselves materialists appeared to me to be shutting themselves off from philosophy, wisdom and the life of the spirit, which are certainly not material things. Those of my circle who rejected religion in totototo seemed to me to be casting away the ideals that had sus tained our people through so many generations before we had fashioned guide posts to our own lives that could stand up against the sort of buffetings that the old guide posts had with stood. In this some of us lost sight of the larger view that</page><page sequence="18">MORRIS R. COHEN 65 Thomas Davidson had taught, that we have no right to break away from the past until we have appropriated all its experi ence and wisdom and that reverence for the past may go hand in hand with loyalty to the future, 'to the Kingdom which doth not yet appear.י " In Spinoza Cohen saw a kindred spirit and in Spinoza's writings he found most clearly developed "the rational and tolerant attitude to the values of religion" for which he had been searching. If "religion consists in humility (as a sense of infinite powers beyond our scope), charity or love (as a sense of the mystic potency in our fellow human beings), and spirit uality (as a sense of the limitations of all that is merely mate rial, actual or even attainable), then no one was more deeply religious than Spinoza." In these passages Cohen is describing not only Spinoza's religion, but also—and especially—his own. In his later years Cohen came to view with more sympathy the role of ritual "as a primary fact in human religious experi ence. For each of us the symbolism of our childhood offers paths to the peace and understanding that can never be wholly replaced by other symbolisms. For me the ancient ceremonies that celebrate the coming and going of life, the wedding ceremony, the birth and the funeral service, give an expression to the continuity of the spiritual tradition that is more eloquent than any phrases of my own creation. The ritual may be diluted by English and by modernisms, but the Hebrew God is still a potent symbol of the continuous life of which we individuals are waves. So it is, too, with the celebration of the eternal struggle for freedom, in the family service of the Passover. "Like vivid illustrations in the book of my life are the prayers of my parents, the services at their graves, the memory of an old man chanting funeral songs at the jakrzeit of my dear friend Dr. Himwich, the unveiling of the monument to the beloved comrade of my life's journeys, and the celebration of the continuity of generations in the Passover services in the home of my parents and in the homes of my children. And though I have never gone back to théologie supernaturalism, I have come to appreciate more than I once did the symbolism in which is celebrated the human need of trusting to the larger</page><page sequence="19">66 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK vision, according to which calamities come and go but the continuity of life and faith in its better possibilities survive." When Cohen taught in the Thomas Davidson school, he gave courses in the Book of Job and the Hebrew Prophets. When he was a graduate student at Harvard, his work under George Foote Moore formed a major part of his studies. In later years, said Cohen, a considerable part of his reading was in the field of Old Testament literature and criticism, espe daily in days of depression when he had little energy for writing or professional studies. The "larger vision" of Professor Cohen, especially after his retirement from the professorship at City College, encom passed many fields of interest. His eye saw through a "clome of many-coloured glass." He was a whole man; he sought the truth and was willing to open many doors in his search. Logical analysis was one door; scientific method was another door; history and tradition also were doors; active devotion to humanitarian causes was still another door; defense of free dom was another door; a religion of humility, charity or love, and spirituality was also a door. He did not always see all doors at one and the same time. But what man does? He always sought, however, the larger vision and more often than is given to others he had the fortune to see his "father's mansion" in its totality. .Yet can one honestly say that any mortal sees this totality? No; Cohen would say, no. For there is a "Kingdom which doth not yet appear"; there are "those human values that the process of time can never adequately realize or destroy." As his teacher William James said in A Pluralistic Universe: "the word 'and' trails along after every sentence. Something always escapes. 'Ever not quite' has to be said of the best attempts made anywhere in the universe at attaining all-inclusiveness." Morris Raphael Cohen did not always agree with William James, but Cohen himself could have written these sentences. He had a sense of the infinite powers beyond any man's scope. His favorite form of expression was the question; his life was a quest. He worshiped no God, yet, like young Samuel, he lived a dedicated life. In the company of Morris Raphael Cohen, Mr. Justice Holmes once said, he felt the presence of a holy man.</page></plain_text>
