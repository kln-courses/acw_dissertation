<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Burkert Greek Religion (transl. John Raffan) Cambridge, Mass.: Har- vard Univ. Pr. 1985. 493 pp. William M.A. Grimaldi, S.J. Fordham University When Rafer Johnson climbed high above the stadium in the summer of '84 to kindle the Olympic flame few (if any) among the myriads present and the millions watching on TV knew that he was repeating an ancient Greek religious rite. It was the privilege of the victor in the foot-race to light the sacrificial fire on Zeus' altar at Olympia. Religion, as Burkert makes obvious, was an integral part of Greek life from the large public ceremony to the intimacy of the home. So integral was it to Greek life and culture (a culture called by some a "temple culture") that the ability of scholars in the past to write on Greek intellectual, political, literary, social, etc. history without a nod in the direction of religion has always been fascinating. B.'s discussion of religious festivals for example (in accord with his view that rituals give a better understanding of Greek religion) and the part played by civic officials in the cults and the sacrifices reveals two things: the strong presence of religious activity in Greek life and the sacral-secular aspect of official and private life. Both are expressed well in his observation (256) that "The city is a sacrificial community". These festivals were</page><page sequence="2">96 numerous throughout the year and with some chagrin Demosthenes in the second half of the 4th c. remarked that they received more attention than the military campaigns (1st Philippic, 35). The wealth of material assembled by B. makes it clear that religion is critical to an understanding of Greek culture. If we ask ourselves why it has been overlooked the answer may well be the absence of a body of sacred writings or scripture to introduce some understanding into this vast body of material. As a consequence it is not easy for anyone to grasp readily the importance of religion to the Greeks. This difficulty is not made easier by the absence of a formal priesthood, a systematic theology, and a permanently fixed cultic tradition. Thus one of the commendable attributes of B.'s work is his ability to convey the ever present sense of the divine among the Greeks and their response to it expressed in their religious activity. He studies the manifestations of this between 800-300 B.C. in the known Greek world of that time in a series of chapters among which are discussions of Ritual and Sanctuary, the Gods, Polis and Polytheism, Mysteries and Asceticism. The evidence which rarely leads directly back beyond 800 (49) comes from archaeology (inscription, votive gifts, vase paintings, etc.) and poetry (until the writings of the 5th/4th cc.) In presenting it B. follows it where possible back through the Mycenaean-Minoan to the Indo-European and Middle Eastern analogs. Among the many perceptive observations in this work which is important to all interested in Greek religion I find the following of particular significance. The gods, in particular the great pan-Hellenic theoi (a group designated primarily by Homer, Hesiod) belong to an order of reality other than that of man. Though spoken of in anthropomorphic terms they are transcendent and are definitely not deifications (174, 317) of natural phenomena. The higher gods (Zeus, Apollo, Athena), and not the polis, effected the foundation of the moral order (247 ff.); indeed among the Greeks "the attempt to tie the gods to morality in the narrower sense is very old" (249). B. sees in a religious center such as Delphi the source of a universal morality (e.g. murder is wrong) which displaced individual or group interests. The efforts of the 5th c. to clarify what is meant by the gods mark the beginnings of a theology (partly foreshadowed by Xenophanes in the 6th c.). However, as B. notes, the presence of rational criticism even that of a negative character, to say nothing of the theoretical atheism of a Prodicus, Democritus (305 ff.), had no effect of any significance on the religion of the Greeks covered in this study. The well-known intellectual crisis of the 5th c. was without long term effects and was in fact countered by a move toward a more pure concept of god whose elements can be found in Socrates, Euripides, and later Plato, Aristotle. There are numerous other facts introduced by B. which offer new understanding of the important place of religion in Greek life and which merit mention here, such as the place of prayer in their daily lives, the idea of death as a good not an evil, their hope for life after death. In general I believe it would be correct to say of B.'s fine study that it is more analytically descriptive of the varied aspects of Greek religion, more factual than interpretative, or, as B. himself says, his work "seeks . . . to indicate the manifold variety of the evidence and the problem of its interpretation" (7). In doing so it brings to the foreground a part of classical Greece which has contributed substantially to the rich significance of its culture.
