Marx’s point was that, economically speaking, these are all false binaries: the practice of exchange will always turn the one into the other, though the general trend would seem to be from ‘‘body’’ to ‘‘phantom’’ and not the other way around.1 By contrast, however bizarre they look up close, Defoe’s fictions from a critical distance all seem to reduce themselves to matters of fact, and if it can be said that his protagonists are haunted by anything, this usually turns out to be some figment of alienated conscience. As he himself put it, in an allusion to one of the most popular poltergeists of his own day, the so-called Drummer of Tedworth, ‘‘conscience indeed is a frightful apparition itself, . . . a drummer . . . on the soul.’’2 This is the logic that chastens Roxana’s premonitions of her jeweller’s death, or Crusoe’s projections into that spectral footprint in the sand.

There is, however, one work that stubbornly resists such translation: Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year (1722). Unlike Defoe’s other protagonists, the narrator of the Journal is neither accosted by personal conscience nor overly invested in his account book. Yet the London he depicts is a protogothic city overrunwith ‘‘Appari- tions’’ indeed. Here, clouds arrange themselves into menacing ‘‘Shapes and Fig- ures, Representations and Appearances,’’ while the streets are set with ‘‘mournful Scene[s]’’ in which every ‘‘speaking sight . . . has a Voice with it, and a loud one to call us all to Repentance.’’3 Their differences from one another notwithstanding, these specters never reduce themselves to mere figures of material, psychological, or moral reality. Their sole purpose seems to be to leave what Walter Scott called a deep ‘‘impression of reality’’ itself, and it is their fidelity to this task that, in Scott’s words, makes ‘‘the hair bristle and the skin creep.’’4 That extraordinary fidelity helps to explain why, of all Defoe’s fictions, the Journal is the least comfortably classi- fied as such, and why some of the most fruitful and provocative criticism of this manifest piece of ghost writing turns upon its claims to be counted as history, which is to say as a sign of the real. Here, though, I would like to take the ghosts that animate A Journal of the Plague Year as historical remnants in and of themselves, viewing them through the lens of what Defoe and his contemporaries actually had to say about apparitions. Some- what surprisingly, given the alleged juggernaut of enlightenment rationality, they said quite a lot, and a no less startling majority of that was not at all dismissive.5 Indeed, five years after finishing A Journal of the Plague Year, Defoe popularized six prolific decades of English parapsychology in his cornucopianHistory and Reality of Apparitions, and, as the lone topographer of his interest in the supernatural has shown, that work consummates a lifelong conversation with long oral and literary traditions of ghost belief.6 As I want to show, Defoe’s interest in these vital traditions is closely bound up with his literary practice.7 Such entwining, though, was virtu- ally inevitable, for late-seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century negotiations of the meaning of the word ‘‘apparition’’ actually limn a haunted house of symbolic gambits and epistemological gambles that we have come to associate almost exclu- sively with modern English fiction. I The bare frame of this house is nowhere more apparent than in the strange history of the reception of the Journal of the Plague Year. As Robert Mayer has lately shown, that history has always pivoted on the unresolved question of whether or not the Journal itself counts as history: Do the graphic tokens that com- pose it add up to fact or fiction?8 In one notorious example of the embarrassment Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 83 </page> <page sequence="3"> this quandary can create, the eminent twentieth-century epidemiologist L. Fabian Hirst once diagnosed the plague that ravaged London in 1665 as, at least in its initial stages, the pneumatic—as opposed to the bubonic—strain of the disease. A recent literary critic gleefully points out that the symptoms that prompted Hirst to the pneumatic hypothesis were actually presented to him by the Journal, fraught as it is with what Defoe and his contemporaries termed the ‘‘Tokens’’ of subcutaneous hemorrhage. Some of these tokens, the Journal reports, became visible only at the time of death, a distinguishing feature of pneumatic plague. Awkwardly enough, though, the Journal was composed almost sixty years after the plague in question, and its narrator, Defoe’s fabrication, in point of fact lacked eyes to lay upon the mostly invisible tokens in question. Barring some primitive memory (Defoe did turn five during the plague year), the most we can say is that, in the words of the aforementioned critic, Defoe ‘‘saw these ‘Tokens’ in his imagination,’’ while his narrator, strictly speaking, cannot be said to have seen them at all.9 And yet, for the modern historian of contagious disease, their ideal or imaginary or phantasmic glow seemed to have been produced by their practical currency in the world of actual events. It seemed in turn possible to overlook the glow and credit these ‘‘Knobs as broad as a little silver Peny’’ (195) as plausible and articulate vestiges of that world. It so happens that in Defoe’s Journal itself, the ‘‘mortal Marks’’ of plague that sooner or later appear on each doomed body express this very paradox. Their status as visible symptoms of contagious disease (‘‘gangreen Spots, or mortified Flesh’’) can never be completely detached from an occult sense of their relevance to what cannot be ‘‘perceiv’d,’’ which is to say to what Defoe comfortably termed the ‘‘in- visible World’’ (195). Defoe’s narrator, H. F., attributes both the plague’s arrival and its mysterious departure to ‘‘the secret invisible Hand’’ of God; even the physicians, he notes, were ‘‘oblig’d to acknowledge that it was all supernatural, that it was ex- traordinary, and that no Account could be given of it’’ (247). And yet at the same time H. F. does intend to account for the plague, and to this end he often supposes it ‘‘really propagated by natural Means’’ (194). On occasion he even ventures that ‘‘there is no apparent extraordinary occasion for supernatural Operation,’’ and that ‘‘the ordinary Course of Things appears sufficently arm’d . . . to execute the Fierceness of Divine vengeance, without putting it upon Supernaturals and Mira- cle’’ (194). Defoe’s famous equivocation between a plague simply ‘‘propagated by natural Means’’ and a plague that supernaturally manifests some ‘‘secret invisible hand’’ has been interpreted as a kind of Aristotelian compromise with efficient cause, and so it may be.10 In other circles, that same compromise might well be taken as evi- dence of the historical encroachment of epistemology upon metaphysics, realism upon romance.11 But this equivocation, so central to the Journal, is surely more than a sign of the historical mutation of one interpretive (or representational) paradigm into its successor. Rather, we may link Defoe’s attempt to adjudicate between the 84 R     </page> <page sequence="4"> natural and the supernatural dimensions of the plague—between the spectral and practical faces of its ‘‘Tokens’’—to the attempt he made throughout his occult writ- ings to find some ‘‘indeterminate’’ ground between the visible and invisible worlds. For Defoe, this was also to find and chart a representational field halfway ‘‘between imagination and solid foundation’’ (HRA, x), and indeed in the Journal it appears to be literature, in Defoe’s own gerundive sense of ‘‘writing,’’ that permits certain pneuma to become visible and to acquire the efficacious illusion of material and historical substance. Because the graphemes that compose the literary text behave in this way, misrecognitions like the epidemiologist Hirst’s are not only understand- able but are, in effect, not really misrecognitions at all. This returns us to the historical difficulty of classifying the Journal generically. Walter Scott very typically deposited this work into ‘‘that particular class of compo- sitions that hover between romance and history.’’ He also found that in the Journal Defoe ‘‘drew pictures almost too horrible to look upon,’’ thereby inducing later readers to see Defoe’s text as a prototype of gothic fiction.12 At the same time, though, Scott’s bizarre presumption that the very letters Defoe put down on the page somehow behaved much as pictures do—and with something of their seem- ingly supernatural urgency—lures us beyond the literary categories that hardened in his own romantic period. The same presumption also entices us to place the Journal not at the inception of a literary form but rather around the time of the disappearance of a very different one. For it is in the ‘‘pictures’’ that fill its pages, and yet are nowhere to be seen there, that we first notice the Journal’s affinity with a peculiar and entirely contemporary genre devoted to the drawing of such pictures: apparition narrative. II In essence, apparition narratives were registers of what one of their seventeenth-century authors, John Aubrey, called ‘‘the Oeconomie of the invisible World.’’13 Wending their way through Lucretius and Martin Luther, these narra- tives registered incidents from Old Testament times to present English ones in which people claimed or were said to have perceived ‘‘Apparitions, and other sensi- ble Manifestations of the certain existence of Spirits of themselves Invisible.’’14 What we now call seances and poltergeists crowded their pages, along with the ‘‘Apparitions of aMan’s own self ’’ rumored to appear before death, prognosticating specters, and assorted images of the absent.15 Flourishing in the last decades of the seventeenth century and in the first decades of the eighteenth, apparition narratives were also cash cows for a prenovelistic publishing industry, as their sheer numbers would seem to attest.16 And while a few of them were written in a debunking spirit, most were at least experimental in their attitudes toward their own subject matter, and several of the most popular spoke with an air of solid conviction. Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 85 </page> <page sequence="5"> Though it’s tempting to identify them with ghost stories or with gothic fiction, the apparition narratives still so ubiquitous in the 1720s really have no analogue in ours. For one thing, they did not conceive of their subject as necessarily supernat- ural; as is well known, the category of the natural and its attendant laws were under strenuous negotiation at the time. For another, the strange visitations they narrated were not, in Scott’s phrase, considered outright ‘‘horrible,’’ owing to the fact that apparitions were seldom taken for ghosts in our sense of the spirits of the departed. That, to many, smacked of Purgatory and the coercive chicanery of those ‘‘doctors of the Roman church’’ whom Thomas Hobbes so roundly scolded in Leviathan (1651). These terrorists of the mind, Hobbes famously charged, had falsely legiti- mated what are in fact mere ‘‘idols of the brain,’’ zealous to make good self-serving ‘‘doctrines of hell and purgatory, the power of exorcism, and other doctrines which have no warrant, neither in reason nor in scripture.’’17 Writing almost eighty years after Hobbes, at the opposite end of an unparalleled—but in tone oddly unper- turbed—outpouring of English writing about ghosts, Defoe was no less eager to indict such ‘‘modern roguery’’ (HRA, 350). Echoing the many self-appointed au- thorities who had weighed in on the subject since Hobbes, he too maintained that there were few things more ‘‘delusive’’ than the notion that apparitions are really ‘‘departed souls.’’ Without acceptingHobbes’s contention that all specters aremere political figments, Defoe nonetheless declared the ‘‘absurdit[y] of souls remaining in a wandering, unsettled state after life’’ (HRA, 95) on the sensible or at least peace- appreciating grounds that if they were really able to do so, ‘‘the habited and visible world would have been continually haunted with ghosts, and we should never have been quiet’’ (HRA, 99). Fair enough. But if apparitions were not ‘‘departed souls,’’ still bound to the narrative trajectories of human life, what were they? And what might their relation- ship be to those who still evidently saw, certainly reported, and ultimately read about them? To the modern eye—of which Scott’s is perhaps representative—the apparitions who fill the pages of Defoe and his contemporaries resemble nothing so much as pictures. Anything but revenants, they were frequently taken, literally, to be appearances; in an apparitional event, as Defoe himself put it, ‘‘spirit may vest itself so with flesh and blood, that is seemingly, so as to form an appearance’’ (HRA, 31). This is ‘‘an appearance’’ much in the sense we would today intend when speaking of somebody’s appearance, except that there is no ‘‘somebody’’ there, and there never was. There is only the appearance—the appearing, seeming without being, amedium that has become its ownmessage. In this sense—one largely obso- lete since the early nineteenth century—‘‘apparition’’ has most in common with the mechanical details of the Dutch realist canvas.18 To rational Protestant observ- ers like Defoe, the appearances of such appearances thus were not to be confused with visits by angels or devils per se, though both angels and devils had been known to cook them up and Defoe, for one, was certainly very interested in the recipes they might have used. Nor had apparitions any necessary moral implication, 86 R     </page> <page sequence="6"> though they could serve justice by for example fingering unpunished miscreants or hinting at the whereabouts of lost wills, and, as we’ve already seen, they could cer- tainly be used as metaphors for insulted conscience. Nor, though they could be faked by frauds, were apparitions often deemed the offspring of natural magic, and though the still-cited Robert Burton had tentatively matched the probability of seeing them to the depth of melancholy, they were only rarely attributed to men- tal disturbance. Neither demon nor delusion—nor necessarily linked to the deceased—the modern apparition was often most exactly painted in the nascent language of natu- ral philosophy, as a simple configuration of the air. This is not the crude reduction it sounds, since air’s material density and attendant mediatory capacities had come under unprecedented scrutiny in the last decades of the seventeenth century, most particularly at the hands of Robert Boyle. Critically speaking, Boyle’s mechanical model of the air—as demonstrated in his now infamous air pump and systematized through several enduring mathematical formulae—was long ago forced to confess its social, rhetorical, and at last political designs, and so its embrace of the same vacancy Boyle said he had discovered at the heart of air.19 Far less often appreciated, though, is Boyle’s curiosity about what he took to be air’s stubbornly occult quali- ties. He noticed its tendency to assume configurations not necessarily perceptible to all, its residual elusive and incalculable qualities, and even its potential for action as well as for passive ‘‘spring.’’ Indeed, like so many of his fellows in the Royal Society, Boyle was keenly interested in apparitions themselves, and even financed investigations into the second sight.20 The interesting aporiae in his model of air mean that the inherently narrative language ofmechanical philosophy could assim- ilate seemingly aesthetic and openly anthropomorphic assertions like Defoe’s that in an apparitional event ‘‘moving air describes in (to others invisible) small and exactly shaped Clouds, the very Faces, Shapes, Names and Distinctions of such Persons, Nations, Towns, Cities, and People of whom theseMists, meteor, and other Clouds represent the Actions. Darkness it self forms the Posture of things.’’21 The northernmost latitudes, fromScotland up to Lapland, were supposedlymost condu- cive to such displays because the air there was held to be exceptionally rigid, hence especially apt to support and preserve apparitional forms. Thus—pneumatically—conceived, apparitions became the protagonists of a long line of hefty works that fixed matter-of-fact accounts of their manifestation within the frames of Protestant theology and natural philosophy, thereby working a perverse reconciliation between these two discourses on reality. The very title of the geologist JohnBeaumont’sHistorical, Physiological, and Theological Treatise of Spir- its (1705) announces exactly this method of exposition and interpretation, one adopted by everyone from respectable members of the Royal Society like Joseph Glanvill and Beaumont to men of the cloth like William Baxter and Robert Kirk, to the more platonically inclined of the Cambridge professoriate such as Henry More. Hand in hand with their weighty works went shorter and more ephemeral Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 87 </page> <page sequence="7"> popular accounts of apparitional events; indeed, these were often incorporated into longer ‘‘Collections of Relations’’ (as Glanvill called his), which in turn plagiarized freely from one another.22 Though accounts of local and recent apparitions had obvious roots in oral culture, they thereby also, and significantly, gained a funda- mentally literary scaffold. What we might call the literariness of contemporary apparitions—their mani- festation and multiplication primarily via the graphic medium of the printed page—becomesmore vivid whenwe notice that several of themost popular appari- tions of the long eighteenth century began their careers as poltergeists—literally, as ‘‘racketing spirits’’ who remained invisible to their original percipients.23 In their company were numbered the so-called Drummer of Tedworth, Old Jeffery of the Wesley parsonage at Epworth, and, later, the celebrated Cock Lane Ghost. While each of these spirits initially made itself known through fumes, thumps, and other disturbances of the air, none was classified as a bona fide ‘‘Apparition’’ until its story went into print, often accompanied by visual images to supplement a narrative of intrusion into normative experience. The Drummer, for instance, was not only im- mortalized as a ‘‘Sculpture’’ in the second volume of JosephGlanvill’s 1681 Saducis- mus Triumphatus but found his story the occasion of several new and revised editions of this most influential of seventeenth-century demonographies. Though unseen by the hundreds of visitors who flocked to the London house she was supposed to have haunted, the Cock Lane Ghost took the shape of a vaporous maiden at the head of numerous poems and print ballads about her. It was only upon such textual appearances that these and similarly invisible spirits began to be classified as appa- ritions, and that they became available for ratification or contemptuous dismissal among their several narrators.24 As has occasionally been observed, many apparition narratives were partly rhetorical in nature, peddling sensory evidence of a supernatural realm that could double as proof of God’s own existence. (No ghosts, no God, as the saying goes.) Hobbes’s infamous renunciation of all supernatural entity, in Leviathan, had been linked to his atheism, andmost apparition narratives in some way positioned them- selves as refutations of Hobbes’s seemingly relentless materialism. Thus William Baxter’s Certainty of the World of Spirits (1691) was ‘‘written for the Conviction of Saducees and Infidels,’’ while Saducismus Triumphatus (1681), Joseph Glanvill’s pop- ular vade mecum to apparitions past and present, was known in one of itsmany earlier incarnations as a fairly triumphant ‘‘Blow Against Modern Sadducism.’’ In the in- terest of compelling readerly belief, apparitional narratives made conspicuous efforts to verify the good character of living witnesses to the phenomena they de- scribed. In doing so, they also committed themselves to formalizing and normaliz- ing—we might almost say materializing—certain practices of linguistic and intel- lectual exchange; apparition narratives functioned in these systems partly as tokens whose credit could in turn validate an emerging community of observation and knowledge. The conventional wisdom is that apparition narratives ultimately lost 88 R     </page> <page sequence="8"> their credit in the economy of knowledge they helped create, and ended up in that debtors’ prison we call the aesthetic.25 But if this really was their fate, it had not yet befallen them in the first decades of the eighteenth century. On the contrary, the quasi-aesthetic qualities just mentioned enhanced apparition narratives’ epistemo- logical value, along with what we might call their social value as validating tokens within an emerging system of linguistic exchange. One place this spectral economy may be glimpsed is in the standard literary practice of representing apparitions to curious nonpercipients (that is, readers) as they had first represented themselves to the person who presumably originally per- ceived them. The person could be anyone, of any sex, class, or degree of literacy; individuality was not important, although good character, for obvious reasons, was. What really mattered, though, was possession of the requisite receiving faculty, the second sight. This faculty, still of burning interest to Samuel Johnsonwhen hemade his Scottish tour, was notable in part because it suspended all distinctions between the literal and the metaphorical, and between the historical subject and his demon- strably nonhistorical object.26 The airy figures available to the second sight often had reference to the future, even as they could impersonate bodies extant in the present and past. Thus positioned at once outside the history of the senses and en- tirely within it, apparitions were peculiarly suited to the kind of publicity they re- ceived in the printed pages of the day. Indeed, the Scottish clergyman John Frazer’s popular 1707 treatise Deuteroskopia (Second Sight) defined apparitions as ‘‘Represen- tation[s]’’ linked to ‘‘future contingent event[s]’’—as representation before presen- tation, as it were.27 If apparitions ‘‘were’’ anything, then, they were representations of the oddly static conditions of their own sightings. Such sightings would resist both the rhetorical and the historical articulation—the narrative—upon which they nonetheless depend if they are to enter the system of credible exchange we call collective knowledge and thereby become visible to others. As one Anglican divine put it to Samuel Pepys, ‘‘second sight’’ is a very proper term of that sight which . . . visionists have of things by representation. For as the sight of a thing itself is in order of nature the first or primary sight of it; so the sight of it by any representation . . . is in order of nature the second; or secondary sight of that thing, and therefore the sight of any thing by representation tho first in order of time may properly be call’d the second sight thereof. Thus the sight of a picture in order of nature is indeed the second sight of the thing, whose picture it is.28 Defoe was to copy this pictorial assessment when he set out to summarize and further popularize decades of English ghost writing. ‘‘An apparition,’’ his History and Reality of Apparitions finds, ‘‘assumes the shape and appearance of [a] man him- self, clothes himself in his likeness . . . as a painter clothes the cloth he paints on with figures, postures, habits, garments, all in colours; while the passive person represented is in no way affected with or concerned in the draught representing him’’ (HRA, 132). Defoe’s most immediate predecessor, John Beaumont, likewise Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 89 </page> <page sequence="9"> held that ‘‘genies’’ can present us ‘‘with the Species or Images of those things they would persuade us to, as in aGlass; on which Images, when our Soul privately looks, those things come into our mind.’’29 In any event, to the extent that the sighting of apparitions inverts the ‘‘order of nature,’’ and supplies representations without originals, clothing without cloth, and reflections without glass, textual narratives recording these sightings replicate their own subjectmatter, and stimulate cognitive paradoxes similar to those that characterize the second sight itself. Not to acknowl- edge these narratives’ quasi-pictorial resistance to the very narratives of cause and effect they seem to verify is to miscalculate their value to an emerging practice of exchanging and assigning value to certain forms of knowledge. For example, Michael McKeon’s magisterial Origins of the English Novel depicts the late Stuart explosion of apparition narratives as an especially vivid symptom of the transition from metaphysics to epistemology that accompanied the rise of the novel. In their emphasis on empirical verification, he maintains, the apparitionists aimed to impose new criteria of veracity on metaphysical phenomena—a gesture that in itself tolled the death knell of such phenomena as a valid and authentic order of experience.30 Yet it seems that apparition narratives may have been rather more than evidence of metaphysics on the run, if not already overtaken by epistemology. They might also be understood as self-consciously literary structures, too firmly wedded to the metaphysics of apparition itself to liberate themselves. As such, the words in which they were necessarily written could both perform and trigger an intricate cognitive process. In this process, meaningful and coherent forms take shape within historical andmaterial sign systems only to withdraw from those same systems, thus most stably signifying their ultimate autonomy from them. This may be why in such narratives the individuated presence of both the (secondary) narra- tor and the original percipient is so critical. Because the text of an apparition narra- tive, uniquely, simulates at once both the agent of perception and its object, it gains a unique relationship—indeed, a virtual identity—with what it represents. This identity in turn makes it possible for others to ‘‘see’’ what is described by written characters on a page. Unsurprisingly then, apparition narrative seems to have legit- imated the specters it represented by exploiting some of the uniquely graphic possi- bilities of formal textual representation—of ‘‘literature.’’ For someone like Defoe, this was no great leap. This particular writer appears to have seen writing itself as an originally and inherently occult phenomenon, one literally instituted by God’s finger as it inscribed the Ten Commandments on stone tablets. In fact, Defoe’s 1726 Essay upon Literature viewed print as an especially wor- thy heir to just this occult legacy: Not only was printing a matter of ‘‘types impress- ing their Forms on Paper’’ but the art itself was likely invented by none other than Faustus, who ‘‘from thence was taken for a Conjurer.’’31 Something of this sensibil- ity lies behind the faith that many early apparition narratives placed in the unique power of the printed word. This was power to validate the specters described both bymimicking the way they had first been impressed upon the air and by stimulating 90 R     </page> <page sequence="10"> the original process by which they had first been seen. Beaumont, for example, identified reading and writing about the ‘‘extraordinary Visitations [that had] hap- pen’d to me’’ with the visitations themselves, confessing to his patron, the Earl of Carbury, that ‘‘I could not well with-hold myself from perusing the Best Authors I could meet with, relating to it, in Order to draw an Abstract of what I found most Material in them, and to publish it together withmy own Experience and Thoughts in that kind.’’32 In such cases, the page threatened to rival the air itself. Just so, the most sensa- tional ‘‘Relation’’ inGlanvill’s Saducismus Triumphatuswas the story of theDrummer of Tedworth, a pugnacious spirit allegedly dispatched by one of Oliver Cromwell’s military drummers to plague a provincial magistrate. ‘‘Oral report’’ had it that Glanvill had retracted his published ‘‘assertion of belief ’’ in his own ‘‘well-attested narrative’’ of the spirit’s rampages through the magistrate’s house, and a new edi- tion of Saducismus Triumphatus was rushed to the press after his death in order to ‘‘demonstrate [those reports] to be false.’’ Pivotal here were letters of testimony that would ‘‘add a very real weight to the value, as of that story, so of the present Edi- tion.’’33 Hence it was not the specter itself who both assumed and disturbed the air of reality but rather the previously printed ‘‘story’’ about it. Glanvill even likened the effects of his own ‘‘Relations’’ of modern hauntings to those of the ghosts upon their original witnesses: ‘‘Not to make much noise to disturb these infallible Huffers [who doubt the reality of apparitions],’’ he wrote, ‘‘I softly step by them, leaving onely [a] Whisper behind me.’’34 Meanwhile, other apparition narratives, like Cot- ton Mather’sWonders of the Invisible World, drew on Puritan investment in the spirit of the letter; they aimed less to verify supernatural visitations as matters of fact than to realign the experience of letters so it could count as an order of experience in and of itself. Defoe’s own commentary on the ‘‘Devil’s disguises’’—his many ma- nipulations of the air to produce apparitions—is exemplary. Complaining that ‘‘we dress [the devil] up in more suits of clothes, andmoremasquerade habits, than ever he wore,’’ Defoe’s History and Reality of Apparitions sets out to help its reader ‘‘form such images of the old gentleman in your mind, that you may not be cheated about him’’ (HRA, 362). What’s more, apparition narratives themselves often cheerily announced their inherent literariness by making literary texts germane to the narratives themselves. For instance, in one of the many versions of the still-celebrated Account of the Appari- tion of Mrs. Veal, the image of a dead woman appears to her girlhood friend and the two spend the better part of an afternoon engaged in literary criticism, discussing ‘‘what Books they read, and what Comfort in particular they receiv’d from Drelin- court’s Book of Death.’’ The latter book, the ghost maintains, ‘‘was the best . . . on that Subject was ever wrote.’’35 Subsequently, one of the many print accounts of the apparition was attached as an endorsement to a new edition of Charles Drelin- court’sThe Christian’s Defence against the Fears of Death. And why not? For the ontolog- ically challenged Mrs. Veal verifies Drelincourt’s speculations through her own ex- Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 91 </page> <page sequence="11"> perience of the afterlife. Here, apparition narrative supplies visual proofs (tokens) that are nonetheless premised on an immaterial and nonhistorical—an ultimately invisible—body. It’s not at all hard to see how this paradox might prefigure certain modes of literary representation, particularly those novelistic ones that—like the account ofMrs. Veal itself—aspire not just to create the illusion of sense experience but to approximate the grounds of experience themselves. The same paradox even more wholly validates authors like the unreconstructed Protestant Defoe, who held that apparitions like Mrs. Veal are not revenants tainted by the purgatorial mists of popish doctrine but nothing much more (or less) than media: pneumatic imper- sonations of the absent that both validate and objectify the very faculties that per- ceive them. Small wonder that Credulity, Superstition and Fanaticism, William Ho- garth’s 1762 attack on midcentury ghost belief, should have shown the most celebrated English specters literally rising from the pages of apparation narratives likeGlanvill’s enduring Saducismus Triumphatus. Hogarth’sMrs. Veal is even looking for herself in one such book.36 III All of this may seem to lie far afield from A Journal of the Plague Year, though it is worth noting that Defoe himself apparently penned the most popular of the many versions of the Mrs. Veal story in circulation in the early eighteenth century. In point of fact, Defoe’s authorship of this short pamphlet has been dis- puted recently on the grounds that he ‘‘did not believe in ghosts’’ of the purgatorial sort Mrs. Veal appears to be.37 But this is to ignore the way the Account works as a kind of intraliterary meditation, one that does not necessarily require belief in returning spirits of the departed, per se. Indeed, in the version of The Apparition usually attributed to Defoe, as elsewhere, literature is not just the means whereby apparition is represented. It is also apparition’s raison d’eˆtre and thus the source of its exchange value—a value that became also its truth value. The same thing is evident in Defoe’sHistory and Reality of Apparitions, which explains the proliferation of apparitions in the Old Testament and their relative scarcity after Christ in light of the fact that ‘‘we have now a more sure word of prophecy’’ in the Gospels (HRA, 21). Apparition A.D., in other words, was for Defoe a fundamentally literary event, an epiphenomenon of an encounter with letters. A Journal of the Plague Year, in its turn, uses literature—‘‘writing’’—to image a sensible world now past. The singular nature of this image allows the Journal to stand legitimately as the very authentic picture of events it seemingly only ‘‘pretends’’ to be. In this respect, it is more like an apparition narrative than anything else. Luckily, there are other respects as well. One is the narrative’s form.The Journal is of course not a journal at all: it only appears to be. In reality, it is an account shaped out of memoranda presumably scribbled during brief periods of self- 92 R     </page> <page sequence="12"> induced quarantine by H. F., a London saddler of middle age. Unlike that of, say, Robinson Crusoe, H. F.’s ‘‘original’’ journal never appears in the text but is only alluded to from time to time as the hidden source of a narrative that observes no consistent chronological order, and in fact doubles back upon itself many a time, its temporal logic trapped in a maze of puns and obsessive reiteration.38 In the ser- vice of this oneiric idiom, H. F.’s narrative filches all kinds of written signs of the real. It is regularly interrupted by columns of statistics taken from the death rolls, by public ordinances, and by latter-day hieroglyphics—the Jesuit IHS, the printer’s flower, the magician’s ABRACADABRA pyramidally reduced—which would surely obstruct the narrative’s flow from one end of the plague year to the other if that narrative did not so often obstruct itself. Both the Journal’s false designation of its own genre and its rampant heteroglossia force us to think of it first and foremost as nothing but writing. For his part, H. F. never really asks his reader to distinguish him from his writ- ing. Indeed, he actively discourages us from viewing him as a mere eyewitness to the shocking scenes that unfold in his city of death, instead ‘‘desir[ing] this Account may pass with [future readers], rather for a Direction to themselves to act by, than a History of my actings, seeing it may not be one Farthing value to them to note what became of me’’ (8). If its author is to circulate as a token of any ‘‘value,’’ H. F.’s storymust itself resist its own presumed historicity, its place in a sequence of percep- tible causes and predictable effects. Its task becomes instead to render ‘‘apparent’’ everything H. F. claims to have ‘‘seen.’’ But what does he claim to have seen? In fact, he pretends to record little beyond ‘‘the Face of Things’’—a face from the start so very ‘‘much alter’d’’ by the plague that the appearances of ‘‘Things’’ are as abstract and ideational as they are palpable. Thus at the very moment that he promises to sketch the ‘‘Face of Things,’’ H. F. can only tell us that ‘‘Sorrow or Sadness sat upon every Face’’ (16). Just so, H. F. is perfectly aware of a strange identification between the words he uses to render ‘‘the Face of Things’’ and the delicate ontological status—the mere apparency—of the world thus rendered: ‘‘Were it possible to represent those Times exactly to those that did not see them, and give the Reader due Ideas of the Horror that every where presented it self, it must make a just Impression on their Minds, and fill them with Surprise’’ (16). The unfulfilled subjunctive mood of this sentence matters, for in Defoe’s text ‘‘Horror’’ itself is seldom elicited, only the ‘‘Idea’’ of it, and that ‘‘Idea’’ rises less from direct description than from a superficial register of what in fact remains invisible. For instance, we are less shown the city of death than told that ‘‘London might well be said to be all in Tears; the Mourners did not go about the streets indeed . . . but the Voice of Mourning was truly heard in the Streets. . . . Tears and Lamentations were seen almost in every House’’ (16). The ‘‘pictures’’ the Journal paints for us are, by their own confession, no more or less than the shapes of sound. This conflation of showing and telling, while perhaps anathema to today’s creative writing manuals, is so central to Defoe’s symbolic pro- Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 93 </page> <page sequence="13"> cedure that it is only a matter of time before our narrator himself is absorbed into the invisible scene he describes, his place there sealed in one oft- (and justly) cited editorial insertion near the end of the Journal. Here, as H. F.’s eye roves London’s now engorged mass graves, an erstwhile silent editor steps in to inform us that ‘‘the Author of this Journal, lyes buried in that very Ground’’ (233). This of course begs a question: Just who (or what, or indeed where) is H. F.? We’re not the first to wonder. Both his provenance and his immunity to the plague have mystified centuries of readers. The provenance problem is usually solved with reference to Defoe’s own uncle, Henry Foe, who obviously shares H. F.’s initials, who was in London at the time of the plague, and of whom H. F. can thus be seen as a kind of literary revenant.39 The immunity problem, which is more interesting, remains unsolved. H. F. himself wonders why he never gets sick, and attributes his stubborn good health to a psalm that seems to promise him protection when his Bible falls open to the relevant page. That the secret of H. F.’s immunity is somehow literary only seems more likely when we stumble across that ‘‘piece of Ground in Moorfields’’ (233) that is his grave. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be fair to say that the narrator’s literal burial inMoorfields coincides with his figural burial in the printed page. But the circumstances of the Journal are nothing if not extraor- dinary; the fact that H. F., as Defoe’s construction, only appears to exist means that what would normally be considered a literal burial is actually a figurative one, while H. F.’s literal burial is as literal as it can be: it is his, or at least his voice’s, burial in letters. This reversal is the key to understanding the Journal as an apparition narra- tive, and also as an intervention in that genre, narrated as it is not just about an apparition but by one. Appreciating this intervention would seem to nudge us toward the emergent English novel, toward ‘‘that form that form has none’’ but in whose formation De- foe is always supposed to have played a crucial part. But before we venture further in a direction anyway less revelatory than it might at first appear to be, we should pay tribute to a third apparitional feature of H. F.’s journal, the plague itself. Like our scribblingwitness to it and his text, the plague conflates literal and figural orders of representation. The plague is of course invisible in and of itself; it’s apparent only through its antagonism to coherent social, moral, and above all bodily form.40 Understood as a ‘‘Visitation,’’ it makes many very ‘‘dismal Objects’’ out of all its victims, but there is, properly speaking, no ‘‘it’’ for H. F. to see when he speaks of ‘‘the Plague,’’ only those dismal objects, the apparent shapes it makes out of the voices and bodies of the living. The pustules that signal the plague’s presence are of course its quintessential apparitions, ‘‘terrifying Particulars’’ that permit the ‘‘Physicians . . . sent to inspect the Bodies’’ of the dead to ascertain that the cause of death ‘‘was neither more nor less than the Plague’’ (195). H. F. so obsessively returns to these telltale ‘‘Knobs’’ of ‘‘mortified Flesh’’ that we tend to remember them as having been rendered in scrupulous and graphic detail. But this is not in fact how they are presented: the closest H. F. ever comes is 94 R     </page> <page sequence="14"> a simile (they are ‘‘as broad as a little silver Peny’’) likening them to the very sign of the presence of an abstraction, a coin. Otherwise, H. F. prefers merely to chart the perception of the ‘‘fatal Tokens’’ (56), as when a mother ‘‘discover[s]’’ them on her daughter’s thighs and realizes that the girl, though still breathing, is a ‘‘dead Corpse from that moment.’’ Almost at once, ‘‘Fright . . . seiz’d her Spirits,’’ yet this is fright as imagination and projection, aligned with the fact that here as elsewhere the ‘‘Tokens’’ themselves actually shirk both presentation and representation (56). When the marks of the plague do become grudgingly visible, they tend to knot ordinary chains of temporal sequence, as in the case of the betokened girl who, from the moment of their appearance, is at once already, not yet, and never dead. In turn, though Defoe’s reader cannot see these tokens at all, it is by their means alone that the plague becomes in any way visible, historical or communal—that it becomes, in a word, narratable. Meanwhile, at the Journal’s narrative and apparently historical level, H. F.’s fel- low citizens aremore thanwilling to see the plague through the scrim of apparition. Astrologers, ‘‘wizards and cunning people,’’ all perceive dire shapes in clouds and comets and pass the bad news on to a fearful populace. H. F., notably, distances himself from ‘‘the Error of the Times’’ (21) and dismisses such visions as literary manipulations, effets d’e ́criture promulgated by ‘‘People who got Money by it, that is to say, by printing Predictions and Prognostications’’ (21). He particularly resents the ‘‘Books’’ that, in an eerie evocation of the terrifying tokens of the plague itself, ‘‘frighted [their readers] terribly’’ because they ‘‘foretold directly or covertly the Ruin of the City’’ (21). If the plague gives an unlooked-for boost to a nascent pub- lishing industry, it also opens a passage into a world of pure media, one in which H. F. need make no functional distinction between the literary texts upon which the market confers value and ‘‘the Dreams of oldWomen, . . . Voices warning [peo- ple] to be gone,’’ or between the same texts and certain ‘‘Apparitions in the Air.’’ The latter include ‘‘Voices that never spake,’’ ‘‘Sights that never appear’d,’’ and ‘‘Clouds’’ in which people ‘‘saw Shapes and Figures, Representations and Appear- ances’’ though they ‘‘had nothing in them, but Air and Vapour’’ (22). In the Journal, then, false apparitions become visible as over-motivated literary constructions—figments produced through the material exchange of certain sym- bolic counters that pretend to be real. But if this is what they are, that leaves literary media themselves open to manipulation into alternative and potentially somehow ‘‘truer’’ apparitional forms. This is exactly howH. F. sees the space of his own page, where apparitions pointing to the plague are replaced by the apparently natural phenomenon of the plague itself. Hence the Journal begins with a Dutch outbreak communicated ‘‘in ordinary Discourse’’ (1), and, though H. F. concedes that ‘‘we had no such thing as printed News Papers in those Days to spread Rumours and Reports of Things,’’ and that everything ‘‘was handed about by Word of Mouth only, so that things did not spread instantly over the whole Nation as they do now,’’ the ‘‘spread’’ of plague remains in large part a matter not of ‘‘Things’’ but of lexical Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 95 </page> <page sequence="15"> appearances (1). To be sure, public officials initially discover ‘‘evident Tokens of the Sickness upon . . . Bodies that were dead,’’ but these mediated sights are immedi- ately ‘‘printed in the weekly Bill of Mortality.’’ ‘‘The People’s Eyes’’ fall upon these bills, and their ‘‘great uneasiness’’ mounts apace not with actual incidents of illness but with written instances of the plague, each more ‘‘frightful’’ than the one before (2). H. F. is later at pains to point out that often the bills themselves lied, and he summarily replaces them with his own statistics, but the effect is very much the same. The other object of horror for ‘‘the People,’’ interestingly enough, is the very air around them. This is so not only because the atmosphere seems to store significant pictures, but also because, one way or another, it is believed by most to be the me- dium through which the plague itself passes. Some are of the opinion that ‘‘the Breath’’ is full ‘‘of strange Monsters and frightful Shapes, such as Dragons, Snakes, Serpents, and Devils, horrible to behold’’ (203). Others subscribe to a miasmatic theory of ‘‘noxious pestilential Vapours, or any other Thing in the Air’’ (219). H. F. himself spurns both of these attributions of agency, figure, and vitality to the air. But in so doing, he also certifies their power, in the collective and abstract realm of public ‘‘Opinion,’’ to shape perception and action, and on occasion we do find him willing to ‘‘joinmyExperience’’ to them (220). ‘‘Opinion’’ may not necessarily have much use value in establishing matters of fact, but like fiction it has considerable exchange value; indeed, it is practical language—like warnings against conversa- tion with possibly infected otusiders—that H. F. classifies as ‘‘talk[ing] to the Air’’ (230). Just so, H. F. might well discredit the shape of collective belief along with most forms of certainty about apparition. But once the plague retreats, his words can only confirm the people’s collective determination to ‘‘depend upon it that the Air was restor’d; and that the Air was like a Man that had had the Small Pox, not capable of being infected again’’ (230). We are reminded here of the only other immune ‘‘Man’’ in the Journal, H. F. himself, who at this point again demands our attention less as a narrator or even as a character than as an apparition in his own right—one that plays the same mysteriously mediatory role as the air he maligns.41 H. F. is certainly the most ethe- real figure to appear in his own story: thoughwe never see him, he glides indefatiga- bly through his city’s many ‘‘Passages,’’ peeping into burial pits and death carts and admonishing the unrighteous, an omniscient voice trapped in an illusion of the first person. We learn that H. F. often ‘‘got Admittance into the Church-Yard by being acquainted with the Sexton’’ (61) and that he usually ‘‘kept [himself ] pent up within doors without Air,’’ in effect entombed. When he does venture out into the air, several telling adventures befall him. On one occasion, he joins a crowd ‘‘all staring up into the Air, to see what aWoman told them appeared plain to her, which was an Angel clothed in white.’’ The woman ‘‘described every Part of the Figure to the Life,’’ and many believe they see it too, but for his part, H. F. insists, she ‘‘could not make me confess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must have lied. 96 R     </page> <page sequence="16"> But the Woman, turning upon me, look’d in my Face, and fancied I laugh’d, in which her Imagination deceiv’d her too, for I really did not laugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor People were terrify’d, by the force of their own Imagination’’ (23). While H. F. stresses his own skepticism, what we see is his apparitional kinship with the cloudy angel. Of course, he did not laugh, never having been there in the first place. Thus of course the visionary woman would see him to have done just that. Here, it is through his skeptical rejection of air as a symbolic medium that H. F. himself materializes as just such a medium, one to which cognition (verified by his own disbelief ) is joined. Likewise, more than once, he appears to his fellow citizens as nothing but an appearance. When he tries to chide a ‘‘dreadful sort of Fellows’’ for their drunken revelry, they ‘‘ask’d me what I did out of my Grave, at such a Time’’ (65),—and H. F. is vindicated when ‘‘he who asked . . . was struck from Heaven with the Plague, and died in a most deplorable Manner’’ (66). Later, a gang of women attempting to break into his brother’s abandoned house fails to register his presence; though he berates them, he confesses, ‘‘I could not perceive that my Discourse made much Impression upon them all that while,’’ and they are only disbanded by the sudden arrival of ‘‘a Man [who] carry’d . . . all the Dead to their Graves . . . in Form’’ (89). Just who and what H. F. might be has never escaped the scrutiny of his readers, to whom he has seemed everything from a full-blown ‘‘character’’ whom Defoe may or may not want taken ironically to ‘‘an intensified and almost abstract version of the ordering self.’’42 Speaking of the moment in Moorfields when H. F. uncon- sciously looks upon his own grave, one recent critic says more than he knows when he remarks that ‘‘it comes as no shock to learn [H. F.] is dead, for he was never alive.’’43 This essentially intermediate quality identifiesH. F. not only with the angel in the cloud but also with a ghost another Londoner sees in a ‘‘narrow passage.’’ Just as the plague is on the rise, this ghost allegedly ‘‘made signs . . . plainly intimat- ing . . . that Abundance of the People should come to be buried in [a nearby] Church Yard; as indeed happen’d’’ (24). At the same time, though, H. F. resembles no one so much as the ghost-seer himself, who with all the psychotic precision of a latter-day Ezekiel ‘‘describ[es] the Shape, the Posture, and the Movement of [the ghost] so exactly, that it was the greatest Matter of Amazement to him in theWorld, that every Body did not see it as well as he.’’ The ghost seer, we learn, eventually ‘‘persuaded the People into so firm a Belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another fancied he saw it’’ (24). H. F. can be said to do no less, or more, than this for his own readers. Yet at the same timeH. F. claims to have seen no ghost at all. As with the woman who discerned shapes in the clouds, he confesses he ‘‘could not see the least Appear- ance of any thing’’ and that though ‘‘that [the seer] saw such Aspects I must ac- knowledge, I never believ’d; nor could I see any thing of it my self, tho’ I look’d most earnestly to see it, if possible’’ (24). Far from undermining the seer’s authority, Spectral Currencies in the Air of Reality 97 </page> <page sequence="17"> H. F.’s skepticism is itself the most valuable spectral token in this literary ‘‘passage.’’ As forward-looking assessments of Defoe’s narrative procedures are apt to acknowl- edge, H. F.’s skepticism seems to authenticate him as a narrator of other, less tangi- ble appearances. But, seen at its own moment in what Defoe himself construed as the ‘‘History of Apparitions,’’ this same posture of mind stimulates an economy of perception that seems positively Lockean in its particularity and credibility—only, upon stricter scrutiny, to resolve into mere abstractions, idealities, the phantasmic shapes of sound.44 No t e s 1.

Lecky was perhaps the first to notice that between 1660 and 1720 arguments against the reality of apparition were ‘‘extremely languid’’ while at least twenty-five works were published more or less on their behalf. See W.E.H. Lecky, The Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe (New York, 1955). Nonetheless, Keith Thomas’s pres- ently more authoritative Religion and the Decline of Magic (Oxford, 1971) posits a radical decline in ghost belief, as does Stephen Greenblatt’s recent study of ghosts in the En- glish Renaissance, which does not imagine ghosts to have survived Reginald Scot’s 1584 Discoverie of Witchcraft as anything more than theatrical illusions; see Stephen Greenblatt, Hamlet in Purgatory (Princeton, 2001). 6. SeeRodneyM. Baine,Daniel Defoe and the Supernatural (Athens, Ga., 1968). Defoe’s best- known piece of ghost writing has long been the 1705 A True Relation of the Apparition of one Mrs. Veal, though his authorship of that interesting pamphlet has recently been challenged by George Starr in ‘‘Why Defoe Probably Did Not Write The Apparition of Mrs. Veal,’’ Eighteenth-Century Fiction 15 (Spring 2003): 421–51 (discussed later). As both Starr and Baine note, a great many of Defoe’s works engage the world of spirits, from A Political History of the Devil (1726) and A System of Magick (1726) to the brief ‘‘Vision of the Angelick World’’ found in Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe (1720). 7. Thus Leslie Stephen could find that the twelve-page True Relation of the Apparition of one Mrs. Veal (discussed later) so often attributed to Defoe ‘‘contains in a few lines all the 98 R     </page> <page sequence="18"> essential peculiarities of his art’’; Leslie Stephen, Hours in a Library (New York, 1875); cited also in Manuel Schoenhorn’s introduction to Accounts of the Apparition of Mrs. Veal (Los Angeles, 1965), i. 8. Robert Mayer analyzes the Journal’s reception history to establish it as a ‘‘pseudo- morph’’ constructed out of a ‘‘nexus of historical and fictional discourse’’—a nexus that becomes central to the reader’s Jaussian ‘‘horizon of expectations’’ and ultimately to the novel genre itself; see Robert Mayer, ‘‘The Reception of A Journal of the Plague Year and the Nexus of Fiction and History in the Novel,’’ ELH 57 (1990): 542. See also RobertMayer,History and the Early English Novel: Matters of Fact from Bacon to Defoe (Cam- bridge, 1997). Weighing in on ‘‘the vexed question of whether [the Journal] is history or fiction’’ are, representatively, Louis Landa, introduction to A Journal of the Plague Year, xxxvii, and JohnRichetti, who decides that it is ‘‘pseudo-history in the interest of expert political propaganda’’; see John Richetti,Defoe’s Narratives: Situations and Structures (Ox- ford, 1975), 234. 9.

This is the implication of Louis Landa’s introduction to the Journal, and also underlies George Starr’s now classic representation of H. F.’s ‘‘equivocation’’ as ultimately rhetor- ical in nature, a deliberate effort ‘‘to reconcile and combine . . . seemingly opposed outcomes’’ in order to present ‘‘a model of sustained moderation’’; see George Starr, Defoe and Casuistry (Princeton, 1971), 81. 11.

Starr, ‘‘Why Defoe Probably Did Not Write The Apparition of Mrs. Veal,’’ 421. Starr marshals an impressive array of evidence from Defoe’s supernatural writings, along with his likely contempt for ghost-believing Anglicans like Joseph Horneck, to con- clude that the attribution of The Apparition of Mrs. Veal that dates from the ‘‘List of Writ- ings’’ George Chalmers printed along with his 1790 Life of De Foe is false and that the text ‘‘should return to the limbo of anonymity’’ (450). But if we see Defoe’s conception of apparition as linked to his conception of literature, the attribution could still stand. The text might—as Starr leaves us room to believe—be a parody of contemporary accounts of its ilk; or it might simply be that ghost-belief in and of itself is simply irrele- vant to the other kinds of credit the text explores and indeed accumulates. 38.
