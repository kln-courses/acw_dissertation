<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS a warm, marshy lake at the south end of Death Valley National Monument in San Bernardino County. Here 488 artifacts found during several brief "digs" are de- scribed under such headings as projectile points, blades, drills, gravers, scrapers, choppers, hammerstones, milling stones and manos. Only five of the artifacts are bone, one is a shell bead, and one is an intrusive black-on- white potsherd. The only burial was that of an infant flexed into a small bell-shaped pit. Recovery of 3249 stone flakes as well as bird and animal remains shows that the site was a workshop area as well as a favorable place to camp in what is now very barren desert except for the oasis of the small lake and the nearby Amargosa River, an intermittent stream. Wallace and Taylor postu- late that the site was occupied during a somewhat moister phase of climate, and that there may even have been rudimentary floodplain farming at that time; but the present oasis would seem to provide reason enough for the accumulation of a fairly dense midden. A single "occupational phase" is indicated by the artifacts, which bear many resemblances to what M. J. Rogers designated Amargosa II in 1939. The authors state that this phase should now be dated at about A.D. 900-1100 through association with Anasazi sherds, and they think that Saratoga Springs may have been occupied by Amargosa II people who followed the river of that name from Nevada toward Death Valley. This agrees in estimated dating with the stone "mounds" in central Death Valley, hence a general linking up of the mounds, Saratoga Springs, Amargosa II and southern Nevada "Puebloid" is indicated.

Papers of the New World Archaeological Foundation, No. 7, Orinda, California, 1960. ix + 43 pp., 49 figs. $2.00. This report continues the publication of the research done under the auspices of the New World Archaeologi- cal Foundation in the Central Depression of Chiapas, Mexico. The project reported here consisted of recon- naissance and limited test excavations conducted by Navarrete in the winter of 1959 in the Frailesca sub- region of the Central Depression. This subregion encom- passes an area to the southwest of the Grijalva River, extending from the foothills of the Sierra Madre of Chiapas to a point about 10 km. short of the river. Sev- eral tributaries of the Grijalva cross the Frailesca, and the map showing the distribution of sites suggests that oc- cupation centered along the courses of these rivers. The objective of the investigation was to compare the ceramics of the Frailesca with those of the Preclassic center at Chiapa de Corzo. This objective was achieved, and im- portant data were also obtained about occupation of the area during the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods, both of which are very poorly represented at Chiapa de Corzo. The report presents brief descriptions of each of the 57 sites visited, as well as a listing of the ceramic classes encountered at each location. There are sketch maps of nine of the major sites, and a short discussion of the changes in architecture through time. The ceramic classes of each of the chronological phases are described, and adequate illustrations of rim forms are provided. The phase system used in the description of the ceramics is adapted from the 13 phase system developed for Chiapa de Corzo, but descriptions of the wares are in- dependent, and based on the Frailesca material alone. The Preclassic phases in the Frailesca were closely related ceramically to the Preclassic phases at Chiapa de Corzo, and the data for these phases will take on addi- tional significance when the more detailed Chiapa de Corzo sequence has been published. During the Preclas- sic, the Frailesca reflected the general widespread con- tacts of the Central Depression with almost all the other major areas of Mesoamerica. The Early Classic occupation of the Frailesca was very limited, but a great development of the subregion took place during the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods. The Frailesca data for these periods are impor- tant, for material of this time range is almost totally lacking near Chiapa de Corzo. There was a tendency to a more regional and localized development, with a dis- appearance of most of the outside contacts which char- acterized the Preclassic. The only evidence of outside connections was an influence from Oaxaca and the Chiapas coast, which appeared in the Frailesca during the Early Postclassic period. It is interesting to note that the Frailesca remains show considerable continuity from the Late Classic period through the Early Postclassic period. The continuity of these two periods seems to be a wide- spread pattern in Central Chiapas, which provides an in- teresting contrast with the sharp discontinuity at the end of the Late Classic period in several neighboring areas. A decrease in population at the end of the Early Post- classic was followed by an almost total abandonment of the Frailesca subregion during the Late Postclassic. Im- portant Protohistoric and Colonial remains were en- countered only at the town of Suchiapa, which is known from documentary sources to have been occupied by the Chiapanecs. Aside from Suchiapa, Colonial occupation of the Frailesca seems to have been restricted to haci- endas serving as centers for the cattle and sugar produc- tion of the Dominican friars. Navarrete suggests that erosion of agriculturally productive soil, due to over- population during the Late Classic, may have been responsible both for abandonment of the region during the Late Postclassic, and the sparseness of Colonial settlement. Each of the series of publications issued by the New World Archaeological Foundation is best evaluated in the light of the Foundation's total research program.

Achados Arqueologicos num Sambaqui do Baixo Ama- zonas. PETER PAUL HILBERT. Instituto de Antro- pologia e Etnologia do Para, Pub. 10, Belem, 1959. 22 pp., 17 figs., 2 maps. The archaeological sequences along the Amazon river are gradually being delineated, principally by Peter Paul Hilbert, who has devoted his efforts over the past decade to this task under the auspices of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia. The paper under review describes a shell midden on the north side of the Amazon, a few kilometers west of the modern town of Alenquer. Located in a swamp, the site is inundated during the rainy season. The refuse accumulation is composed of rocks and shells. Stone and pottery artifacts and 175 potsherds collected from the surface by Frei Protasio Frikel between the years 1939-41 form the basis of the type descriptions. Pottery artifacts include 26 tubular pipes, the majority with incised dec- oration. The pottery was classified on the basis of temper into three types. The majority (85%) is tempered with sili- ceous sponge spicules, known as cauixi; 5% is tempered with shell, and the remainder of the sherds contains both materials intermixed. Decoration is by brushing, incis- ing or modeling. Motifs used in incised designs include zoned fine crosshatch, zoned parallel lines, unzoned parallel stepped lines, concentric squares, and squared spirals. Vessel shapes are simple bowls and jars with a direct rim. Lug adornos sometimes occur at the rim. Stone artifacts include squared axes with lateral notches, crudely shaped hammerstones, manos, and metates or mortars. The tubular pipes that comprise the most unusual artifacts show the same range and relative frequency of temper varieties as the vessel sherds. Maximum length is 17 cm. Some are plain but others are modeled to produce anthropomorphic forms and decorated with broad lines and fine zoned crosshatch. The only other tubular pipes from the lower Amazon are the much smaller and cruder ones from the later Mangueiras phase, the second pottery-making complex in the sequence on the Island of Maraj6. Hilbert suggests that the two principal kinds of temper represent two archaeological phases, the earlier having shell temper and the later cauixi temper. Most of the decorative styles and the pipes are equated with the later Jauari Phase. There is no clear-cut distinction, how- ever, since examples occur of both pipes and decorated sherds with shell or shell-and-cauixi temper. The major significance of this report is that it docu- ments the existence on the lower Amazon of a site show- ing strong affiliations with the Ananatuba phase, the earliest pottery-making culture on the Island of Maraj6. The zoned fine crosshatch decoration is identical to that characterizing Sipo Incised of the Ananatuba phase. Ves- sel shapes are also similar. Ananatuba phase pottery is tempered with crushed sherd, but cauixi is not native to Maraj6 so that this is not a significant difference. When the affiliations of the complexes on Maraj6 Island were traced, it was suggested that the Ananatuba phase was derived from somewhere up the Amazon. Hilbert's re- port is the first clear evidence in support of this inference. The detailed description and excellent illustrations make it a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Amazon prehistory. BETTY J. MEGGERS Smithsonian Institution Washington, D.C.

These monographs on preceramic sites in southwestern Hokkaido will interest archaeologists concerned with pre- Neolithic cultures in the Far East, and those who look for Asian prototypes or parallels for early assemblages found in northwestern North America. English summaries and captions on illustrations make both monographs useful to those who do not read Japanese. Excellent drawings and photographs of nearly all the implements, detailed tabular summaries of types, and carefully drawn site plans and profiles that record the provenience of artifacts attest to the high standards of workmanship that were followed from the planning of excavations to final publication. These monographs were prepared by teams of specialists from several museums and universities; they represent the combined -and not always compatible--views of a number of leading Jap- anese archaeologists on the very intricate problems of pre-Jomon cultures in Hokkaido. The Tarukishi excavations, carried out in 1954, were the first to demonstrate the presence in Hokkaido of a blade industry at a site for which reasonable antiquity could be claimed. The five authors report separately on their special interests. Shuta Takeuchi describes the preliminary survey, the organization of the team, and the manner in which records were kept, all of which indicate meticulous care in excavation. Masao Minato, in a dis- cussion of the geology of the site, supported by maps and profiles of the terraces, shows that the artifacts came 578 [ VOL. 26, No. 4, 1961</page></plain_text>
