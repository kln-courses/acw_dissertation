Authors should use this when preparing their manuscripts for submission. For further details on submission of papers, authors are requested to consult and follow the latest Instructions for Authors which are available on the Seminar website at http://www.arabianseminar.org.uk Quotations, single words, and phrases from Arabic, or other languages written in non-Roman alphabets, should be transliterated according to the systems set out below. However, unless an author insists on a particular transliteration in all circumstances, place names and words from languages written in non-Roman alphabets which have entered English or French in a particular form (e.g. Mocha, Dhofar, qadi, wadi, imam/iman), are reproduced in that form when they are part of an English or French sentence, rather than part of a quotation in the original language or of a strictly transliterated name or phrase. For example: 1 . "the settlement was built in the wadi bed" BUT "the settlement in Wadï Mayfacah" 2. "l'iman alla à Médine" BUT "Imam cAlï vint de al-Madïnah al-Munawwarah" The transliteration systems are as follows: (a) Arabie g j ' fi) * â) * ? ó q ù 4*bzhjro*s£c^k*h ^ (ih) ¿do»sbt^f?m^y Vowels: a i u ã ï 0; Diphthongs: aw ay. Initial hamzah is omitted. The lãm of the article is not assimilated before the "sun letters", thus al-shams not ash-shams. The hamzat al-wasl of the article is shown after vowels except after the preposition //-, as in the Arabic script, e.g. wa-4-wazlr,fi Ч-bayt, but li-1-wazïr. This rule applies specifically to papers on language or literature. See Guidelines for further details. Ta 'marbufah (}) should be rendered -ah, except in a construct [idãfah]: e.g. birkah, zakah, but birkat al-sibãhah, zakãt al-fitr.
