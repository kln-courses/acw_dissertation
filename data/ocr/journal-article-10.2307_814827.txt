<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mutterings/ ICharles Weingartner Monsters recently i found myself before a group of art majors at a large public university trying to get them to think about possible roles for artists in contemporary society. it was they who directed the discussion this way with their questions. their perceptions of the world led them to ask, in a variety of ways, essentially one question: "what are we, as artists, to do in a world like this?" as i tried to respond, i heard myself saying the most obvious and most pedestrian and most perceptive kinds of things, frequently in a single utterance. one example that sums up the sense of all of the utterances i made, goes something like this: "why, you are to do what artists have always done: warn us about monsters." this simple-seeming statement led us into the most complex kinds of considerations of the functions of art and artists, and i had the feeling it was the first time any of these incipient artists had ever thought or talked about art in this way. "monsters," for example, were items in "gothic" stories from or about other times and other places. the idea that "monsters" are among us, and a clear and present danger right now seemed foreign to them-at first. the most obvious example i could think of to try to document my point was mary shelley's frankenstein. none of them knew who mary shelley was, much less that she had written frankenstein. and most of them thought that frankenstein was the name of the monster. i am not exactly deploring their ignorance of the source and the details of the story, but i am exactly deploring their inability to consider the possibility that monsters are always among us, that they are mostly man-made, and that artists have almost always been the first to warn us of them. they also had trouble with the idea of a writer as an "artist," being constrained in their thinking about art to the visual arts. i then tried bosch and magritte as examples, but didn't get too far with that either. then i tried picasso, specifically in paintings such as "guernica." that was a little closer. then i tried the beatles, joan baez, tom paxton, pete seeger, woody guthrie, joan collins, the moody blues, and so on. some worked and some didn't. the problem in communication, as always, is in finding a metaphoric bridge to cross the gap between different experiences and perceptions. having gone from print to painting to oral poetry accompanied by music, i came back to print again: orwell, in 1984 for example; huxley in brave new world-only a very few connections here. they that knew orwell and huxley 14 thought that these men were writing about some other place in some other time. there was no perception of the possibility of these artists warning us about monsters here and now. another try: vonnegut and heinlein. closer. still not much, but closer. vonnegut they had not thought of as an "artist." heinlein neither. but when we got into it, in a curious and unnerving way, with vonnegut's "harrison bergeron" and the idea of the idea of "equality" as a monster, all hell broke loose. it got too complicated to describe here, but connections between artists and their warnings about monsters here and now-and all man-made-started to happen. the synapses between various arts and artists and all kinds of monsters- all man-made-began sparking. painting, as it turned out, was left pretty far behind. photography and cinematography in particular, along with the "non-visual" arts, mostly recorded music, and some (but not much) drama, flared up as examples. the idea of the artist as one of the few early warning systems about monsters finally took hold with a few of the more exotic students, even invoking examples from political cartooning by herblock and mauldin. gary trudeau was more widely known to them (this was several months prior to his being awarded a pulitzer prize for "doonesbury."), probably because he is more easily visible in most local papers. while there was still a lot of trouble with vonnegut's treatment of the idea of "equality" as a monster, this perspective on one possible role for the artist today had at least opened up to some. this experience-extemporaneous as it was-has stayed in my head ever since, and has caused me to notice a few other "obvious" circumstances. first, literature is seldom dealt with as if it has any connection to the lives of those who are "studying" or "teaching" it. it seems condemned to remain in "the third person." both 1984 and brave new world (to say nothing of a short story such as shirley jackson's "the lottery") seem to most students, if not all, to be about somebody else, somewhere else, in some other time. even senior english majors talking about ken kesey's one flew over the cuckoo's nest (which they had just seen dramatized) had great difficulty in using it (or mcmurphy and big nurse) as metaphors for anything in their personal lives. the "story" was "out there"-in the third person. they rejected the idea of kesey trying to warn us about monsters-even after reading the dedication in the book. the second effect of this experience sticking in the English Journal</page><page sequence="2">front of my consciousness has been my noticing items that i would otherwise possibly not have noticed-at least in the same way. for example, i noticed a wire-service story about a curious event in the scarborough zoo in london. it had to do with the behavior of some chimps on the occasion of their keeper having given them their customary "nightcap" of a cup of cocoa. on this occasion, the chimps threw the scalding cocoa at the keeper and smashed their cocoa cups against the wall. it is easy to be anthropomorphic and to say that they were "angry." what they were angry about was the taste of the cocoa on this occasion. it was different from what they had come to expect. it was different because the price of sugar had risen so greatly that it was beyond the reach of the zoo's budget. the cocoa on this occasion was sugarless. that is, it was not as sweet as the chimps had learned to expect it to be. following this noticing, i experienced a recalling. what i recalled was having read (sometime earlier) an account of a similar kind of incident at rutgers university where a psychologist was doing a kind of routine rat-maze behavior-modification number. in this instance, for some reason, the psychologist was not able to provide the usual food the rats had learned to expect as a "reinforcer" or "reward." they too became "angry." that is, when they were not reinforced or rewarded with what they had learned to expect, they destroyed the maze equipment. both of these instances then, in turn, caused me to retrieve (somehow) from my memory the recollection of a cartoon i had seen twenty years or so earlier in the new yorker. this cartoon was one of the first that i am aware of appearing subsequent to b. f. skinner gaining some notoriety for his "box." the skinner box, you will recall, was the site of the early attempts by him to modify behavior through manipulation of a total environment. in any case, the cartoon depicted (anthropomorphically) two pigeons. the two pigeons were in a box which had a button-like arrangement at one end. the legend under the cartoon read: "watch this. i have this guy trained. whenever i hit the button he feeds me." here was another artist trying to warn us of a monster. in this case, the monster takes the form of a colossal non sequitur, as the pigeon cartoon illustrates. the simple-minded 1:1 ratio between behavior and reward that seduces behavior modifiers turns out to be just the opposite of the actual conclusion to be drawn from this syllogism. it is analogous to the fashionable non-sequitur that goes: "the problem may be the solution." however facile that seems to be, and it seems at least as facile as the behavior modifier's "conclusion" that "behavior modification works," the lens of language in this case inverts the actual condition, there are, for example, increasingly frequent illustrations of the possibility that the "solution" is the problem, rather than vice versa. it is, as a matter of fact, almost impossible to March 1976 think of any contemporary "solution" to any problem that does not intensify the problem. in the case of "rewarding" behavior in order to increase the probability that it will persist, what is actually being learned is not the behavior that is visible (that turns out to be highly transitory and impermanent), but rather the invisible expectation of a specific reward. and when that expectation is not met, the behavior that is nominally being "conditioned" not only does not persist, it dissolves instantly and is replaced by a form of behavior that not only was not "taught" but that is highly undesirable-from the rewarders point of view. the point is that the rewarder's behavior is much more contingent upon the reward than is the rewardee's! the rewarder has trapped himself into having to provide a reward, as it turns out, not so much to "reinforce" an intended form of behavior, but to minimize the acting out of unintended, and probably undesirable, behavior. All of which reminds me of a line from Burke's "Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies." It goes: ". . . any condition instituted by force can be maintained only by force." If we transliterate that line into one that relates to "operant conditioning" we come out with something like: ". .. any behavior induced by a reward can be maintained only by that reward." but there is yet another dimension to this monster: it is that the rewarder turns out to have relieved the rewardee of any responsibility for persisting in the intended behavior. a kind of a faustian bargain (something like frankenstein's) begins to become visible. the price that is paid turns out to be much higher than the behavior modifier had intended. he is trapped in a contract that he has not only written out, but that is just the opposite of the one that he wrote. that is the monster implicit in the pigeon cartoon, and explicit in the cases of the chimps and the rats. and the monster is even more perfidious yet! research reported by levine and fasnacht ("token rewards may lead to token learning") in the november, 1974, issue of the american psychologist reveals a curious "side effect" of "rewards"-to wit: "an impressive amount of data from attribution type research has accumulated which indicates that giving a reward can have an effect counter to that desired." if you want to know the details of some of the research, see the article, the point to it all is that the use of "rewards" destroys intrinsic motivation to learn. spontaneous, intrinsic motivation is destroyed by extrinsic reward. the rewardees become "reward junkies" as a result of learning to expect rewards from an external source, and in the process lose the capability of self-motivated learning. a heinous monster indeed. all of which leaves us with several loose ends that you can "tie up" if you feel intrinsically motivated enough to do so. these "loose ends" include: artists as warners of the presence of monsters; the inability of most of us to see or hear these warnings because it does not 15</page><page sequence="3">occur to us that they are about us-here and now; the invisibility of monsters in most literary metaphors; the pernicious tendency for most of us to accept popular non-sequiturs as "solutions" to problems; and the myopic propensity of most managers that leads them to advocate solutions that intensify rather than ameliorate problems. and all of that without even getting into the need- the crucial need-to distinguish between training and education. if extrinsic reward has any "practical" value (and that is open to serious question in view of the price that it exacts) it should be apparent that it is limited to training, and training of a very simple order of physical activity, as in animal training; it is anathema to anything related to education. just in case you cannot recall, training is drill in procedures that comprise a closed system that exists prior to and independently of anyone who comes to learn it. all of the questions that comprise it are convergent-the answers exist and cannot be questioned. the "rewards" are almost entirely extrinsic. education is a different kind of business entirely. it is contingent upon the motives, attitudes, beliefs, assumptions, and inference-making abilities of the learner, the rewards are almost entirely intrinsic for engaging in it. such answers as are indentified in the course of an education seem to consist mostly of other questions-all of them contingent and divergent, once archibald mcleish ventured the opinion that "we teach poetry not to impose answers but to reveal choices." in training we impose answers via extrinsic rewards. in education we attempt to reveal choices via any activity that can be sustained by intrinsic rewards. training is an end. education is a beginning. we don't have many artists warning us about the monsters that surround us in the school business these days. each of us may just have to be an artist in our own way with our own students pointing out the monsters-mostly man-made-and their makers. if we must measure something, let us measure these monsters. if someone must be accountable, let us make it those who make the monsters. if they are not accountable, no one is. i You say you love scratchy, old records? ergo, RReO THE WONDER OF THE AGE: Mr. Edison's New Talking Phonograph - being faithful reproduction of the voices, instruments, and artistry of such good, old per- formers as Enrico Caruso, P.
