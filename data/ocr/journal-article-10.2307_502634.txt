<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAYS IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY, by Samuel K. Lothrop and others. Pp. 507, figs. 230. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, I96I. $12.50. This significant volume consists of 27 essays, dealing with widely ramified aspects of the Indian art of Latin America. The papers constitute a tribute to the work of Dr. Lothrop; in the words of the Editorial Committee (Stone, Bird, Ekholm and Willey), "No one else among his Americanist contemporaries has extracted from the work of art so much information on the past or such insight into the lives of the makers." In keeping with Lothrop's primary interests, the articles relate mostly to archaeology of the higher civiliza- tions, but, as in Lothrop's own work, the areal cov- erage is wide (Sonora to Patagonia) and includes eth- nographic materials as well as Pre-Columbian remains. As a whole, the volume presents a happy balance of description and hypothesis, although methodology re- ceives little explicit treatment and art theory is devel- oped in only a single paper, by Kubler. Illustrations, though abundant, vary considerably in quality, being subordinate to the text. This readable book, which</page><page sequence="2">234 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 67 embodies the latest ideas of many of the leading spe- cialists in Latin American art and archaeology, is in- tended primarily for the serious student of prehistory rather than for the casual reader or connoisseur of art. i) Archaeology, Then and Now, by Samuel Loth- rop, commences the volume with a series of reminis- cences-improvements in transportation in Guatemala since field work there in 1916; early observations of superimposed remains, prior to the application of the stratigraphic method; the growth of New World archaeology until the varied specialists of today no longer feel they are members of the same small club. Lothrop criticizes use of increasingly complex termi- nology, noting signs of revolt against this tendency in recent literature. With part of this the reviewer would agree, but as archaeological data accumulate it is un- avoidable that many new labels will be devised to classify the expanded body of information. A pressing need in New World archaeology is to develop termi- nology which enables us to talk efficiently on several levels, broadly or in detail, in accordance with the problem at hand. 2) On the Colonial Extinction of the Motifs of Pre- Columbian Art, by George Kubler, is an outstanding theoretical contribution. A typology of processes of acculturation in art forms is presented. Juxtaposition is the coexistence of forms derived from two cultures, without interaction, being exemplified by the presence of Catholic churches and ceremonial kivas in the pueb- los of the Southwestern United States. Convergence, involving historically distinct but similar traditions, is found in Aztec emblems and European heraldry. Ex- plants, the continued development of native art forms for a time under colonial rule, are seen in the Post- Conquest Mexican codices and Peruvian wooden drink- ing cups. Transplants result from the incorporation of native forms into the culture of the dominant group, without major changes or development, and are vivid- ly exemplified by the use of obsidian disks, symboliz- ing the sacrificial knife, which were set into Pre-Co- lumbian and Colonial Mexican sculptures to represent the heart. Fragmentation is the survival of odds and ends of native ornament, out of context and without comprehension, as in the stepped-fret meander of Mexico. Kubler emphasizes the small amount of native tradi- tion which has survived from the American Indian civilizations, indicating that only in economically use- ful food plants may significant residues be found. The point is overstated, in the reviewer's opinion, although it is probably quite valid so far as the visual arts are concerned. Kubler's conclusion that symbolic forms are readily perishable while utilitarian traits have a greater survival value is used as an argument against recent attempts to derive aspects of New World sym- bolism from Southeastern Asia. A graduated scale of survival, from useful plants and animals to religious beliefs, is suggested if a few stragglers were the bear- ers of new cultural forms. This is contrasted with acculturation under Spanish rule, which was carried out by people strong in numbers and with colonizing zeal, when religion came first to Indian notice, then art, and finally the utilitarian crafts. Such formula- tions may provoke disagreement, but they represent a skilled and thoughtful attempt to understand poorly investigated aspects of the contact of peoples. 3) Fine Metalwork in Pre-Conquest Mexico, by Dudley Easby, combines sixteenth-century eyewitness accounts with details of manufacturing techniques in describing achievements in aboriginal Mexican metal- lurgy. 4) The Olmecs, Artists in Jade, by M. W. Stirling, deals with archaeologically early Olmec jade carvings and roughly contemporaneous occurrences of jade ob- jects in Middle America. Parallel beliefs about jade are noted in Mexico and China, and it is pointed out that the climax of jade working, in their respective areas, occurred in the contemporaneous cultures of the Olmec and the Chou Dynasty. 5) The Squier Jades from Tonind, Chiapas, by Eli- zabeth Easby, describes a dozen carved Maya jades, reportedly from a burial urn near Ocosingo, which were published almost ioo years ago by Squier. The collection is predominantly Late Classic, five of the pieces being believed to date from approximately 9.i5.0.0.o in the Maya calendar (A.D. 731). Compari- sons are made with other jade carvings and with stylistic features on the Maya monuments. Until the discovery of the Bonampak murals, it was customary to regard female figures as virtually un- known in Maya hierarchal art. Essay 6, Portraits of Women in Maya Art, by Tatiana Proskouriakoff, pre- sents a complex held to identify women in Classic sculptures. If Proskouriakoff is correct, women did, indeed, play an important role in art, explained on the basis of their prominence in dynastic matters. Admit- ting that sexual characteristics are invariably suppressed on the monuments, the author makes comparisons to clay figurines which are clearly female because of their modeled breasts. A more extended discussion of this important line of evidence would have been welcome. In the sculptures, costumes consisting of a narrow, ankle-length skirt, long robe, and beaded skirt with short cape are ascribed to women. Associated hiero- glyphic phrases containing feminine head glyphs sup- port a number of the identifications. Different fashions in women's dress are found in sculptures from the Usumacinta and Petin regions, and it is granted that in Yucatan skirts may have been worn by certain male priests. The implications of this study for a better understanding of ancient Maya society are tremendous, but the evidence will be found difficult to assimilate by the non-speciahlist in Maya epigraphy and sculpture. 7) Types of Ball Courts in the Highlands of Gua- temala, by A. Ledyard Smith, is a comprehensive treat- ment of the greatest known concentration of ball courts in Middle America, 132 in number. The classification into five types is cogently based on combined attributes, utilizing profiles plus the over-all shape of the court as criteria. All examples apparently date from the Late</page><page sequence="3">1963] BOOK REVIEWS 235 Classic or subsequent periods. Concentration of the various types through time and space is noted, and Highland characteristics are pointed out, such as mark- ers in the form of stone heads, tenoned horizontally into the walls. 8) Ball-game Handstones and Ball-game Gloves, by Stephan F. de Borhegyi, adds loop-handled handstones to the ever-growing list of problematical stone objects used in the rubber ball game of the Mexican Gulf Coast. The handstones were supposedly used to de- flect the ball, protect the hand, and steady the player as he maneuvered into position to strike the ball with hips and thighs. Although Borhegyi's suggestion may be correct, we are more and more reduced to the pic- ture of ball-game players as weighted down by ex- cessively heavy accoutrements. Borhegyi recognizes an alternative form of hand protection, consisting of wrap- pings, and suggests that protective paddings were as- sociated with a different type of ball game, centering in the Maya rain forests. 9) Pottery of the Holmul I Style from Barton Ra- mie, British Honduras, by G. R. Willey and J. C. Gifford, brings recent fieldwork to bear on the defini- tion of the Holmul I ceramic complex, one of the first to have been recognized in the Maya Area. Holmul I is subdivided, comparisons made with the intrusive Floral Park phase at Barton Ramie, and speculations offered on the origin of Protoclassic ceramic traits. io) Notes on a Plumbate Vessel with Shell Inlay and on Chiclero's Ulcer, by J. E. S. Thompson, de- scribes a Tohil Plumbate dog effigy and suggests that the depiction of dogs with lacerated ears in Mesoamer- ica was based on the prevalence of chiclero's ulcer in the tropical lowlands, where the animal's ears are often eaten away by the disease. ii) A Possibly Unique Type of Formative Figurine from Guatemala, by A. V. Kidder and E. M. Shook, describes distinctive "Heavy-eyed" clay figurines, which form an unusually homogeneous group at Kaminal- juyu. 12) A Figurine Cache from Kino Bay, Sonora, by Frederick J. Dockstader, discusses a cache of ten dis- tinctive pottery figurines. The suggestion is advanced that these peculiarly-shaped, faceless figurines, some un- deniably female, were associated with mortuary ob- servances similar to those of the modern Seri. 13) The Stone Sculpture of Costa Rica, by Doris Stone, presents valuable sidelights on the diffusion of fundamental cultural patterns as well as detailed re- gional descriptions of art forms. Sculptures from the Atlantic Watershed and Highland Region are related to the South American head cult as opposed to Mexican sacrificial patterns emphasizing the heart. In the same region, foodstuffs of South American origin were prepared with a side-to-side or rocking motion on four-legged, raised-rim grinding stones instead of on the rimless metate with the forward-and-backward mo- tion associated with maize to the north. Sculpture of the Diquis Region is described as showing strong re- lationships to Andean South America, while the Ni- coya Region, having basic affiliations with the South American lowlands, was affected, as well, by signifi- cant Mesoamerican influences. 14) Some Costa Rican Jade Motifs, by Carlos Balser, considers motifs emphasized in jades from the Linea Vieja (Atlantic Watershed) and Nicoya Peninsula. Mesoamerican influences, particularly Olmec, are seen in both centers, southern correspondences occurring more frequently on the Atlantic Watershed. Relation- ships are traced primarily in terms of subject matter and motif rather than by means of basic cultural pat- terns, as in the preceding essay. 15) Grave Associations and Ceramics in Veraguas, Panama, by Joy Mahler, is a resume of grave furnish- ings which, in the author's words, leads to "no major conclusions at the moment." However, hope is ex- pressed that cross-datings will lead to eventual chrono- logical placement of the materials. I6) Anthropomorphic Figurines from Colombia, Their Magic and Art, by G. Reichel-Dolmatoff, presents ethnographic data on the use of wooden figurines and suggests that prehistoric pottery figurines functioned in curing ceremonies rather than in a fertility cult, as has often been supposed. Among the Choc6 and Cuna In- dians, the figurines served in rituals and were then dis- carded or used as toys by children. 17) Pre-Columbian Metalwork of Colombia and Its Neighbors, by William Root, recognizes five stages in metallurgical techniques, from before 500 B.c. to the Spanish Conquest. Highest developments occurred in Stage IV (ca. A.D. 400-700), the final stage witnessing the rise of local cultures to the north, extending into Panama and Costa Rica. Indigenous developments are favored rather than, as some have argued, successive introductions of different techniques across the Pacific. I8) Peruvian Stylistic Impact on Lower Central America, by Samuel K. Lothrop, holds that important modifications in early Peruvian designs took place prior to the spread of the motifs to Central America, rather than resulting from loss of content through the processes of indirect diffusion. The transfer in toto of symbolic artistic concepts is explained by the invention, on the Tiahuanaco horizon, of balsa-wood sailing rafts equipped with center boards. These sea-going rafts, which permitted contacts with the Galapagos Islands, also enabled Peruvians to reach Panama, bypassing the swamps and jungles north of Colombia. Lothrop's ex- planation is intriguing, yet exceptionally close similari- ties between pottery in Ecuador and on the Pacific coast of Guatemala occurred on a much earlier hori- zon, also interpreted as the result of contact by sea (M. D. Coe, American Anthropologist, Vol. 62). What- ever the actual events may have been, Lothrop's article forms one of the most challenging contributions in the present volume. 19) A Cupisnique Bird Jar, by Geoffrey Bushnell, describes an effigy vessel and reflects on the smooth perfection and standardization of Classic Mochica vessels, in contrast to the "rugged individuality" of each Formative Cupisnique pot.</page><page sequence="4">236 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 67 20) Paracas and Nazca Iconography, a well-illus- trated paper by Alan Sawyer, emphasizes continuity in the Paracas and Nazca art of Peru, stressing the persistence of old traits as well as the addition of new symbolic designs. Ceramic motifs are noted to be less complex than their textile counterparts in Paracas art, while the realistic portrayal of religious motifs on tex- tiles disappears with the beginnings of Nazca poly- chrome ceramic decoration. Progressive stylization is traced in Nazca art. 21) Textile Designing and Samplers in Peru, by Junius Bird, presents detailed descriptions of three embroidered textiles. Technical factors leading to er- rors or distortion are noted, suggesting that the designs were made from mental images, without utilizing drafts or models. 22) The Chronology of Inca Wooden Cups, by John Howland Rowe, brilliantly documents the develop- ment of wooden drinking vessels. Inca nobles, who had formerly possessed cups of gold or silver, were usually reduced to the use of wooden cups in the Colonial Period, but cups of wood were given an artistic elabo- ration which was lacking in Pre-Spanish times. Seven- teenth and eighteenth century cups, showing little trace of Spanish influence, display scenes taken from the Inca historical traditions. This artistic flowering was not an isolated phenomenon, according to Rowe, but was part of the cultural renaissance culminating in the Inca rebellion of 1780. These conclusions should be contrasted with those of Kubler (Essay 2), who holds that the survival of native symbolic tradition into the Colonial Period was minimal. In Essay 23, The Bailey Collection of Stone Arti- facts from Puerto Rico, Irving Rouse isolates "early Antillean" and less widely spread classic Taino styles. The former is seen as a possible substratum out of which the Taino style developed. If so, the possibility is lessened that classic Taino art was introduced full- blown from South or Middle America, although influ- ences may have been incorporated from these areas. Almost 20 years ago, Gordon Ekholm argued that Mexican stone "yokes" served as ball-game belts. In Essay 24, Puerto Rican Stone "Collars" as Ball-game Belts, he extends the identification of ball-game belts to "collars" and "elbow-stones" of the West Indies. The hypothesis is well-reasoned and clearly presented. A convincing case is made for wooden prototypes, whose forms were retained in stone. Direct cultural contact between Mesoamerica and the Antilles is be- lieved probable by Ekholm. Other possibilities are not mentioned, e.g. that in both Mexico and the Antilles parallel forms in stone were developed from more an- ciently diffused wooden prototypes. 25) An Experimental Formulation of Horizon Styles in the Tropical Forest Area of South America, an im- portant contribution by Betty J. Meggers and Clifford Evans, recognizes the existence of four ceramic hori- zon styles. Two of these, the zoned-hachure and poly- chrome styles, are believed to have been introduced from the west and restricted to the Amazon basin, the incised rim and punctate styles being distributed in the Orinoco and lower Amazon basins. Slow population movements are favored as the principal means by which the styles were spread. 26) The La Aguada Culture of Northwestern Ar- gentina, by Alberto Rex Gonzalez, defines the Aguada culture as one of two complexes which have frequent- ly been combined under the name "Draconian" or "Barreales." Traits are cited and possible Tiahuanaco influence discussed. In Essay 27, Observations on the Painted Designs of Patagonian Skin Robes, Carl Schuster presents an- other of his detailed, provocative, yet not fully satis- fying comparisons of art forms among marginal cul- tures of the Old and New Worlds. "Genealogical pat- terns," composed of a continuum of human or geo- metric figures, are thought to represent an extremely ancient tradition in both hemispheres. Historical rela- tionship is assumed without considering possibilities of independently hitting on similar compositions when working with such comparatively simple artistic con- cepts as zigzag and undulating lines. Range of varia- tion is not considered systematically, there often being no clear indication if comparisons are made between strongly established patterns or sporadic, even atypical examples. The proponents of worldwide or trans- oceanic diffusion have done a service by calling atten- tion to widely separated cultural similarities, and a number of their formulations may yet prove to be correct. However, more rigorous methodology ap- pears necessary before most Americanists will take the historical reconstructions very seriously. A closing criticism of this otherwise highly com- mendable book is in order, for the dual arrangement of notes and bibliographies on the basis of individual essays is needlessly unwieldy. The reader has first to hunt for the appropriate essay in the "Notes" section, then having found the correct citation or discussion must search further for any corresponding biblio- graphic reference. Compilation of a single bibliography, alphabetically arranged, would have simplified the use of this often important material. ROBERT L. RANDS UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI</page></plain_text>
