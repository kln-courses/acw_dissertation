By Gary Iseminger. (Cornell UP, 2004. Pp. x + 147. Price £21.50.) The Aesthetic Function of Art is a work of consummate craftsmanship. Gary Iseminger is an analytic philosopher's philosopher. He proceeds with clarity and precision at every turn. He defines concepts and distinctions with the sharpness that typically dispels ambiguity. His overall argumentative strategy is ingenious, and his argu- ments, step by step, are transparent and deductively impeccable. The book is like a finely wrought cabinet. Even if one does not concur with Iseminger's ultimate conclusion, an updated version of the aesthetic definition of art which he calls 'the new aestheticism', the book will be instructive, since many of the innovative moves, distinctions and clarifications that Iseminger constructs along the way will be useful to philosophers of different and even opposed camps. The easiest way to situate this book is to classify it, as I have, as an example of the aesthetic theory of art. Indeed, it is probably the most sophisticated and best defended version of the aesthetic theory of art to date. But Iseminger's book is more than merely a simple variation on the aesthetic theory of art, since he not only follows in the spirit of traditional aesthetic theories of art, but also exploits the insights of certain institutional theories of art and historical approaches to it. Iseminger labels his view 'the new aestheticism', and contrasts it with traditional aestheticism, represented by Monroe Beardsley's statement of the aesthetic theory of art. One way in which the new aestheticism departs from traditional aestheticism is immediately apparent in how these views characterize art. For traditional aes- theticism, 'Something is a work of art if and only if its function is to afford aesthetic experience' (p. 8). In contrast, according to new aestheticism, 'The function of the artworld is to promote aesthetic communication'. Perhaps the most striking divergence between these two formulations is the difference between their respective objects of enquiry. Traditional aestheticism is concerned with defining the work of art, whereas the new aestheticism is describing the persisting function of the artworld and the practice of art. That is, the object of the definition of traditional aestheticism is the single artwork - this painting and that concerto; in contrast, what the new aestheticism aspires to capture is the function of all (or most?) of the activities and practices that go into producing the inventory of the artworld, namely, the bulk of © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly Published by Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford 0x4 2DQ, UK, and 350 Main Street, Maiden, ma 02148, USA</page><page sequence="2">ON THE AESTHETIC FUNCTION OF ART 733 those paintings, concertos, and so forth. Moreover, as the phrases 'the artwork!' and 'the practice of art' signal, the new aestheticism has learnt something from earlier brands of institutional and historical approaches to art. In step with certain historical approaches to characterizing art, the new aesthet- icism agrees that the institution of the artworld as we know it has a definite, even recent, provenance. Following Paul Oskar Kristeller, Iseminger locates the emergence of the artworld, also known as 'the modern system of the arts', in the eighteenth century or thereabouts (p. 72). Thus the artworld for him is not something that has always existed and will always continue to do so. It arose at a certain point in time, and it is conceivable that it could come to an end. Con- sequently Iseminger does not take himself to be conceptually analysing something, as they say, 'under the aspect of eternity'. Rather, his task is to characterize the function of the modern system of the arts, a phenomenon which coalesced roughly in the 1800s and which may be gone tomorrow. The modern system of the arts, in other words, is a contingent affair. It is here today, but was not to be found in the Athens of Aristotle, and in any event may be not be around much longer. In this way, Iseminger's characterization of art is strikingly different from the analyses of traditional aestheticists. For they intended to be proffering real or analytic defini- tions in terms of necessary and sufficient criteria for being counted as a work of art. For traditional aestheticists, the characterization of art was a matter of logic, broadly construed. But Iseminger is not doing conceptual analysis. Instead, he is committed only to establishing that certain contingent features of the artworld obtain: he means to specify what the artworld's function has been, as a matter of fact, during the somewhat brief sway of the modern system of the arts. Needless to say, it is not Iseminger's contention that there were not separate arts like painting, poetry and music before the emergence of the modern system. Rather, he holds that in the eighteenth century those various artforms were incorporated into the newly minted system. It is his mission to determine a posteriori what the function of that concatenated or corporate entity has been from its inception to the present. By opting out of the definition game, Iseminger cleverly dodges a number of the most frequently recurring and philosophically threatening objections usually levelled at aesthetic theories of art. First, he side-steps the wrath of the anti-essentialists, since his characterization of the function of the artworld is not presented as a real definition: it is advanced as summarization of matters of fact. Secondly, the exist- ence of readymades, such as Duchamp's notorious metal canine-grooming-comb, does not trouble the new aestheticism. For it is perfectly possible for a practice to have a certain function even though a particular exercise of the practice does not discharge that function, nor is intended to do so. The function of the practice of chairmaking has the function of affording seats, but not all chairs are made for sitting on: some may be made solely to be looked at, while others, like break-away stage props, may only be designed to clobber villains. Since the new aestheticism merely aims at specifying the function of the practice of the artworld, putative counter-examples at the level of individual artworks which neither discharge that function, nor are intended to, leave Iseminger's view unscathed. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="3">734 NOEL CARROLL Another apparent difference between the new and the traditional aestheticism is that the former alleges that the function of the artworld is to promote aesthetic communication, while the latter maintains that the artwork affords aesthetic experi- ence. But what is it to promote aesthetic communication? For Iseminger, something is a communication if it is designed to be understood by others (p. 34). Yet, you may ask, what are others intended to understand when the communication in question is aesthetic? Iseminger's short answer is that the receivers are intended to understand that whatever is communicated is to be appreciated. Presumably it is this appreciative dimension that makes the commun- ication aesthetic. But what does appreciation involve? Iseminger (p. 36) says 'Appreciation is finding the experiencing of a state of affairs to be valuable in itself. Here he means us to take 'experiencing' epistemically. That is, experiencing is a mode of knowing: specifically, it is a non-inferential mode of knowing. An instance of the kind of experiencing that he has in mind might be this: upon exposure to a piece of music, say, the Rondo of Mozart's K447 Horn Con- certo, I grasp (that is, I come to know non-inferentially) that the music is invigor- ating or stirring. Moreover, if I find this experiencing, this episode of non-inferential coming to know, to be valuable in itself, then I am in the state of appreciation. I look at a painting of the crucifixion and I non-inferentially detect that it is sad. If I, furthermore, intrinsically value this experience, if I value the transaction for its own sake, then my mental state is appreciation. This condition is not called aesthetic appreciation: it is allegedly appreciation simpliciter. Finally, it is supposedly the func- tion of the artworld and its practices to promote this state by designing stimuli that readers, listeners and viewers understand are intended to be appreciated by them, in the sense just rehearsed. That is the central claim of the new aestheticism. From it, Iseminger infers a second claim about the evaluation of artworks: 'A work of art is a good work of art to the extent that it has the capacity to afford appreciation' (p. 22). That is, if the function of the practice of art is to promote appreciation, then a work of art qua art that successfully implements this function is good as a work of art to the extent that it does what the practice of art is designed to do. Or, as Iseminger himself puts it (p. 126), 'If an institution has a certain function, then something produced by someone acting in his or her role in that institution is good as a thing of the kind thus produced to the extent that it has the capacity to contribute to the function of that institution in the way appropriate to it as a thing of that kind'. These claims about the function of the artworld and the value of the artwork are at the core of Iseminger's 'new aestheticism'. Obviously, in order to establish his criterion for evaluating artworks, Iseminger's characterization of the function of the artworld must be viable. So I shall turn to his argument for this. The linchpin of the argument is the supposition that 'if something is good at doing something that it was designed and made to do, then doing that is its function', or more precisely, its 'artefactual function' (p. 80). This compact formula, as applied to the artworld, has a number of ideas built into it: first, that the artworld is an artefact, and that it was designed to do some- thing; furthermore, that the artworld is good at what is was made to do, where being © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="4">ON THE AESTHETIC FUNCTION OF ART 735 good at doing something with respect to practices means that (a) it does what it was designed to do better than any other practice does this, and (b) that of all the things the practice does, discharging the function in question is what it does better than the other things it does. Iseminger argues that the artworld, understood as an informal institution that arose in the eighteenth century, can be construed as an artefact that was literally designed to perform the function of promoting appreciation. Moreover, this is some- thing the artworld does better than any of the other things it does, and is also something that it does better than any other comparable institution or practice. But I wonder whether any of these claims can be sustained. I, at least, find strained the notion that the modern system of the arts is an arte- fact. It is a concept. Are concepts artefacts? However, since I agree that the modern system of the arts is a creation of human society, I suspect that not too much of substance may hinge on the word 'artefact'. The idea that this system was designed by anyone is also a bit of a stretch, but one that Iseminger makes more palatable by saying that what he is claiming here is no more than that there were and are people with certain functions in mind who have maintained and modified the system. Nevertheless, I do find highly debatable the historical conjecture that the function that the modern system was introduced to perform was the promotion of appreciation. Iseminger tries to interpret certain eighteenth-century theorists in such a way as to tease this out of their writings. But I remain unconvinced. Of course, I do not disagree that some people have viewed the function of the artworld as Iseminger does. In the eighteenth century, many bourgeois consumers came to regard the pursuit of art as a way to fill their increasing leisure time. They consumed art for the sake of enjoyable or at least absorbing experiences, in a way that may very well correspond to Iseminger's characterization of appreciation. However, at the same time, others regarded the arts as continuing to perform socially serious and useful functions, as the arts had done since time immemorial. This internal artworld debate over the proper function of the arts has been a perennial one, and continues to be so throughout the modern period; in so far as the notion has been contested throughout the period Iseminger has in mind, it is ques- tionable whether one can find a function for the artworld in the way he supposes. Initially, what won an artform entrance into the modern system of the arts was that it imitated the beautiful in nature.1 To be beautiful, in this context, often meant being ideal (in the sense of completing a pattern or tendency in nature that was imperfectly realized in actually existing particulars). Beauty was an idealization, the realization or perfection and discovery of a form already immanent in nature. This being so, it seems that certain of the 'founders' of the modern system of the arts originally organized the system around the idea that its function was the production and dissemination of knowledge (not necessarily non-inferential knowledge). What 1 Iseminger has an interpretation of the notion of imitation of the beautiful which is different from mine, but I think mine is more in keeping with the obvious origins of this idea in Aristotle's Poetics, a document which, along with Renaissance interpretations of it, influenced early conceptions of the modern system of the arts. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="5">736 NOEL CARROLL audiences valued, then, either intrinsically or instrumentally, was not experiencing the stimulus in question, but the knowledge it delivered. The case for this historical thesis, that the founding function of the modern system of the arts was the com- munication of knowledge, seems to me just as strong as, if not stronger than, the case for asserting that appreciation was the goal. Moreover, even in the case of early theorists who might have suggested that the function of art was aesthetic, it is not clear that they had anything like Iseminger's conception in mind. For they were wont to speak of experiences involving pleasure, rather than of intrinsically valued epistemic episodes. Iseminger thinks that the modern system of the arts was assembled in order to promote appreciation. But it is difficult to imagine that the philosophers who might be interpreted in this way would have recognized the account of appreciation which Iseminger attributes to them. This presents him with a problem, since he claims to base his conjectures concerning the function of art upon what participants in the practice of art mutually recognized about one another's behaviour and expectations. But folk in the eighteenth century did not speak as if they had Iseminger's twenty-first-century sense of aesthetic function in mind. Furthermore, I think that Iseminger's notion of appreciation is stipulative and unargued. When a general offers an appreciation of a battle, or a chess master provides an appreciation of the final game in a tournament, I see no reason to suppose that they are valuing for its own sake the experiencing of the objects of their scrutiny, since they may instead value instrumentally the insights they garner (inferentially) from their exercises. Although Iseminger claims that he is not talking about aesthetic appreciation in particular, I think he has defined appreciation simpliciter in terms which many philosophers reserve for aesthetic appreciation. Moreover, it strikes me that his hypothesis, that the function of the practice of art is the delivery of opportunities for aesthetic appreciation, has been perennially contested within the practice of art, from the inception of the modern system of the arts until the present. Perhaps, when Tolstoy maintains that the function of the practice of art is die communication and promotion of fellow feeling, he is no more convincing than Iseminger is when he declares the promotion of appreciation to be art's aim. But there is a significant line of thinking, extending from Hegel through Tolstoy (and others) and Marxists (including the constructivists and socialist realists alike) to progressives in our own day, which certainly should be granted as much authority as aestheticism (both traditional and new). The historical evidence does not support the thesis that one uncontested function for the institution of art was embraced across the artworld from the inception of the modern system of the arts into the present. Rather, what we find is a continuous and running controversy over the function of the practice. Moreover, since Iseminger's hypothesis is a factual one, he cannot argue alternative historical conceptions of the function off the board as conceptually unfounded. Consequently it seems fair to worry that his project may be compromised from the start. It is not my intention here to argue that the Hegelian tradition about the function of art is the one and only correct characterization. Obviously, there are and have been many defenders of the aesthetic viewpoint. In this matter, I favour pluralism. There © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="6">ON THE AESTHETIC FUNCTION OF ART 737 is not one function of art, but many. Moreover, if, like Iseminger, we say that we must ground our hypotheses on the behaviour of the citizens of the artworld, then I think we must admit that there is an enduring argument about which function of art is the proper one. Thus the attempt to elevate one function over the rest fails to be true to the historical record. Iseminger contends that the practice of art is good at performing the role that it was allegedly designed to play, namely, the promotion of appreciation. I have questioned whether the institution was actually designed to play the role that he elects for it. But I am also doubtful or at least not persuaded that it is good at executing the said function in terms of the specific criteria of goodness that Iseminger endorses. For Iseminger, a practice is good in the relevant sense at imple- menting a function if it is better at fulfilling that function than is any other practice, and if it accomplishes that function better than any other function which it might appear to possess. I believe that the claim that the promotion of appreciation is what the artworld does best in either of these ways is open to dispute. There is an informal but very extensive practice of nature appreciation. There are guided tours and guide books that supplement it. Places gain reputations for their panoramas. People travel far and wide to engage in the practice of nature appreciation, and their experiences provide the source of lively conversations, often supplemented by photographs and videos. Furthermore, nature appreciation on many counts appears to meet Iseminger's definition of appreciation. For example, appreciators of nature may aver that they intrinsically value coming to know non- inferentially that the Grand Canyon is sublime (that is, they value for its own sake the experiencing of the Grand Canyon as sublime). I see no reason to suspect that the kind of appreciation promoted by the artworld is superior to nature appreciation. Indeed, there are probably some commentators, including possibly Kant, who think that nature is better than the artworld at engendering unalloyed the kind of appreciation that Iseminger has in mind. Iseminger is ready for this sort of objection (p. 102). Because nature lacks a creator, he thinks it affords a less rich range of qualities to appreciate. Nature, for example, putatively cannot be appreciated for its wit or its boldness. Indeed, he goes so far as to suggest (p. 105) that the appreciation of nature alone would result in a relatively impoverished appreciative life. These suggestions, however, invite a number of critical remarks. Even if it is true that there are more qualities in art than in nature to be appreciated, a proposition I do not think anyone has the slightest idea how to confirm, what difference would that make if, as nature appreciators would undoubtedly counter-claim, the experien- cing of the aspects of nature in question is more intrinsically valuable (since it is purer) when carried off properly? Moreover, some might argue that even if art presents certain occasions for appreciation which nature cannot, it may also be the case that nature has certain qualities which art lacks: for instance, Kant thought that sublimity was first and foremost a property of nature rather than art. Admittedly, this may be a debatable claim. Nevertheless, the burden of proof is on Iseminger to show that nature does not possess an array of appreciable qualities that art lacks. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Phtiosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="7">738 NOEL CARROLL Moreover, of course, since nature appreciation often legitimately involves anthropomorphic imagining, it is not clear that we cannot call the swagger of penguins, if not witty, then at least funny; or, less controversially, describe the upward thrust of a tor as bold. Maybe almost anything art can do nature can do better, albeit anthropomorphically. For all these reasons and more, it is at least arguable that the practice of nature appreciation may be superior to the practice of art for purposes of appreciation. In response, Iseminger might claim that the function of art he is talking about is aesthetic communication, and add that nature does not communicate with us. But I am talking about the practice of nature appreciation - a practice in which nature lovers call to the attention of one another the appreciable aspects of nature by means of photographs, essays and simple ostension. It is not obvious that this prac- tice is inferior to art when it comes to providing opportunities for appreciation. Perhaps you may now be tempted to protest that it is silly to attempt to measure whether nature appreciation or die artworld is better at affording opportunities for appreciation. But if this is a problem, then it is a flaw in Iseminger's method. Iseminger also contends that of all the functions that the artworld can perform, the promotion of aesthetic experience is what it does better than the rest. He attempts to establish this by comparing this function of the artworld with a number of its other putative functions, such as providing status markers. For this form of argumentation to work, Iseminger, of course, must make sure that he has canvassed all of the relevant competitors to the function of promoting appreciation. But I think he has overlooked an extremely obvious candidate, namely, the function of the artworld to transmit and reinforce the ethos of the culture from which it emerges. The arts are a leading vehicle for inculcating into peoples the values, beliefs, exemplars, commitments, emotions, desires, behaviour, myths, morals, manners, ideals, feelings, and so on, that constitute the cultural order of societies. By simul- taneously addressing, often but not always pleasurably, the perception, imagination, memory, emotions and cognition, by the use of concrete images - that is, by engaging so many faculties of the whole person at once - the arts that compose the artworld deeply embed the ethos of the culture in the very being of appropriately prepared recipients. By mixing sense and sentiment, feeling and information, the artworld renders the ethos of a culture accessible to its members and also eminently retrievable for memory, in so far as it encodes that ethos across multiple faculties. The practice of art makes values perceptible to sight and hearing, or in the case of literature it describes them by means of powerful, arresting, memorable images, often in the form of exemplars. This is undoubtedly one reason why every known society possesses arts and why they have survived for centuries. Many of the structures that lie at the heart of the various artforms, including those that constitute the modern system of the arts, were evolved to perform the function of disseminating, maintaining and buttressing the ethos of the pertinent cultures. Vivid imagery, rhyme, metre, alliteration, rhythm, music, dance, song, narrative, dramatic enactment and so forth were developed to instil society's wisdom and virtues in the hearts, minds and memories of its citizenry. The artworld, in this respect, is a key participant in the continuous reconstruction of the social order. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="8">ON THE AESTHETIC FUNCTION OF ART 739 It is very probable that to a great extent we have the artforms and a great many of the artistic structures that we have now as a consequence of the socially adaptive purposes they serve in terms of promulgating, circulating and sustaining the ethos of their home cultures. Surely this is the reason why the practices that comprise the modern system of the arts have endured through the centuries. Moreover, I believe that the case can be made that the artworld continues to perform this function. Indeed, in the age of mass art, it is likely that the artworld is fulfilling this function more comprehensively and effectively than ever before. I see no reason to think that this function, which one might call the communica- tion of ethos, or cultural communication, and which may indeed be the founding function of each of the members of the ensemble of practices we call the arts, is not the equal of the function of aesthetic communication that Iseminger champions. If one function of a practice is better than another function of that practice where the practice exercises the former more reliably, then the case can be made that the artworld communicates culture better than it promotes appreciation, since modest artworks relay the ethos of the culture with far greater frequency than they curry appreciation. At the very least, then, Iseminger needs to demonstrate my error in thinking that the dissemination of the mores, common sense and sentiment that constitute culture is a function that the artworld achieves to a greater degree than it promotes aesthetic communication. Unless he does so, there appears to be a serious gap in his brief for the new aestheticism. One objection Iseminger might level at this candidate for the leading function of the artworld is that it is not an artefactual function, but what he calls a 'systemic' one, a function that evolves rather than being self-consciously made. However, since many practitioners of the arts have not only created works and even styles to disseminate the ethos of their culture, while also arguing that this is what art should do, it seems forced to deny that communicating culture is not among the contenders for the title of the artefactual function of the artworld Moreover, consideration of the function of the practice of art as conduit of the ethos of a culture also reopens the question of what the artworld accomplishes to a higher degree than any other practice. For it is quite plausible to suppose that there is no other practice that transmits the ethos of a people and acculturates its parti- cipants and/or audiences more expeditiously than the practice of art. It is widely believed, for instance, that the maxims, virtues and ideals of a culture are more efficaciously taught by stories that provide gripping examples than by abstract statements of the social creed like catechisms and moral treatises. Likewise the commitments, feelings and folklore of a culture are more readily remembered through song than through almost any other medium. Thus it may be that the communication of culture (also known as the transmission of ethos) is the function that the practice of art excels in to an extent greater than any other comparable practice or institution. Therefore, once again, it seems that Iseminger needs to show why the above view is false before he can conclude that the artworld is unrivalled in excellence, in the two ways at issue, in fulfilling the role of aesthetic communication above all else. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="9">740 NOEL CARROLL 1 think that by moving the discussion to the function of the artworld, Iseminger has put his finger on a problem which, though often unacknowledged, has bedevilled the philosophy of art since the eighteenth century, viz what warrants including a practice in the modern system of the arts. Iseminger, in effect, says that as a matter of fact it is the capacity of the artform or practice to promote aesthetic communication that does the trick. I have questioned the grounds for that answer, but I do think that Iseminger is right to say that we should be explicitly talking about the artworld: it is the Artworld with a capital A that constitutes one of the major problems for philosophers of art. However, though this is the right subject, I think we need to draw from the discussion a different conclusion from Iseminger's. When the modern system of the arts was first assembled, an artistic practice like poetry entered the circle of the Muses on condition that it could imitate the beautiful in nature. This criterion did not last for very long. The rise of absolute music broke the mould. Pure instrumental or absolute music came to be regarded by many as the premier artform - one whose condition was the envy of every other artform. But of course absolute music did not readily fit the rubric of imitation. So other candidate conditions of entry into the modern system had to be nomin- ated. Some were expression, form, and the capacity to afford aesthetic experience. Iseminger adds to die list the promotion of aesthetic communication. But maybe there is no longer any one thing that holds the so-called modern system of the arts together. At one time, the criterion of imitating the beautiful in nature did a tolerable job. But because of historical changes in the various arts, including the rise of absolute music, the proliferation and addition of new artforms, and the experi- mentation of waves of avant-gardes, there is no longer any feature or function or set thereof that in fact or in concept holds these practices together. If they are related at all, it may be a matter primarily of genealogical bonds. Moreover, rather than theorizing about the artworld, as Iseminger does, it may be more instructive today for philosophers of the arts (plural) to examine the individual practices, artforms and even genres that are linked genealogically to the now defunct (and if truth be told, long since defunct) modern system of the arts. Though I do not agree with Iseminger's proposal concerning the function of the modern system of the arts, I believe that his historically specific refraining of the notion of the institution of the artworld and the practice of art represents a genuine advance in the discussion. Iseminger is the sort of thinker from whom one can learn a great deal even when one is disagreeing with him. There are insights to be had on nearly every page of The Aesthetic Function of Art. In fact, I have rarely disagreed with a book so often while at the same time profiting so much from having read it. It is a fine piece of work.2 Temple University, Philadelphia 2 I thank Susan Feagin for sharing her thoughts and her writing on this book with me. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page></plain_text>
