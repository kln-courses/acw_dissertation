Snyder University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Ann Arbor, Ml ABSTRACT Knowledge of human impact tolerance(s) is a basic consideration in the improved design of air transport seat-restraint systems and occupant crash protection. This paper discusses biological factors which influence tolerance, defines tolerance levels, variables including whole body and regional impact, and effect of seat and body orientation. It is concluded that the ultimatę inert i al forces on the occupant specified in FAR 25-561 are not based upon human tolerance considerations; that human impact survival is estimated to be four to ten times the voluntary levels cited; that improved occupant protection requires dynamically tested structural improvements; and that currently available technology such as the NASA air transport seat, or rear-facing seats, should be ut i 1 i zed. RECENT AIR TRANSPORT ACCIDENTS have focused renewed attention on passenger crash safety and the question of crash impact protect ion (1-5) .* Some crashes are clearly non-survi vabl e, but in many crash landings it has been concluded that some occupants should have survived or had less serious injuries had better protection been provided. In some accidents seat failures have been identified as directly influencing passenger trauma and survival (6-8) . There has been much discussion in the technical 1 i terature as well as SAE committees** concerning human tolerance and relationship between the existing Federal Air Regulations (FAR's) pertaining to occupant protection, which are the minimum requirements for civil transport certification under CFR 1A Part 25(9), and the technical state-of-the-art. Human toi erances (s) is a complex issue often misunderstood. The purpose of this paper is to outline current impact knowledge, particularly as related to air transport seat design, and clarify for the design engineer some of the confusion that exists about the meaning of biological impact tolerance data and its application. DATA SOURCES The published data relative to human tolerances to crash impact is extensive. While there is much still unknown, some basic parameters have long been established. A decade ago it was estimated that within the previous 25 years there had been over 220 research studies and over 6,000 references on impact in the scientific and engineering 1 i terature (10) . Some 5,000 tests have been conducted on the AF Daisy track in New Mexico alone (11), and subsequently over A, 000 runs have been recorded on the 750 ft. deceleration track at the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory near New Orleans (12). Numerous other impact sled facilities in various parts of the world in university, industrial, and governmental envi ronments (1 3) have also played an important role. Information on human impact tolerances useful to the aircraft design engineer is available in a number of comprehensive publications and several state-of-the-art reviews. SAE publications providing basic data include Information Report J885 APR80 "Human Tolerance to Impact Conditions as Related to Motor Vehicle Des i gn" (1 A) , intended for the automotive designer and tester.

Other useful SAE publications include "Human Anatomy, Biomechanics and Impact Toi erance" (15) » and SAE paper 716AO6, "Occupant Injury Tolerances for Aircraft Crashworth i ness Des i gn" (16) . SAE has also published a number of Aeronautical Recommended Practices (ARP's) originated by Committee S9 directly related to air transport cabin safety and occupant protection and seat design. These include ARP-750A (in revision) on passenger seat design(17)» and ARP 7^7 A on impact protective design(l8). The SAE-sponsored annual proceedings of the Stapp Car Crash Conference are a valuable source for current impact and restraint systems test findings. For aircraft seat design the most comprehensive source of data is the U.S. Army's Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide (I98O) , especially Vol. IV "Aircraft Seats, Restraints, Litters, and Paddi ng" ( 1 9) , and Vol. II "Aircraft Crash Environment and Human Tolerance" (20) . The Air force System's Command Design Handbook (Human Acceleration Tolerance, 3Q2-2.3 revised 1975) should also be referred to for design guidance on AF transport seating requi rements (21) . Other basic general references include the chapters on "Impact" in the NASA Bioastronauti es Data Book (1973) and Environmental Biology (1966) by Snyder (22-23) » "Survey of the State of Art of Human Biodynamic Response" in Ai rcraf t Crashworth i ness by King (1975) (2b) , "Forces on the Body in Simulated Crashes" by Patrick et al., (1966) (25)» "Impact Accelerations" by von Gierke and Brinkley (1975) (26) . While limited to head impact tolerance, the recent paper by Hess et al. (I98O) (27) provides a comprehensive review of the literature. Another source is the compendum of research in human impact tolerances and seating conducted jointly by the Air Force and Federal Aviation Agency, which contained b, 905 pages of annotated references in two volumes 0963; 1 966) (28-29) . An analysis of United States and NATO countries' air transport accidents from I96A-I97A and evaluation of advanced technology in crash impact protection was published by AGARD in 1976, which included 1,106 ref erences (30) . Much of today's knowledge of human impact is based upon the pioneering work of Col. John Paul Stapp in Air Force studies on the 2,000 ft. track, using a rocket-powered sled, developed at Edwards AFB between 1 9^7 and 195 1» and continued after 1953 at Hoi loman AFB, primarily on the long track and 1 30 ft. Daisy Decelerator. Stapp has published a voluminous amount of data. While the original test reports should be consulted for specific test condi t ions, (references 31 "A3) are among documents reporting key data. The direct application of these findings to increase air transport passenger crash protection was emphasized in his scientific papers as early as 1953 (AA-A7) . TOLERANCE FACTORS The term "human tolerance" is often misused and misunderstood when applied to the body's ability to withstand abrupt decelerati ve forces. It is important to understand what is meant by a tolerance when it is used. Some points which should be clarified follow. There is no single "impact tolerance," but rather there are a range of "tolerances." These will vary with the specific individual who is subjected to decelerative forces and (a) whether whole body or regional impact is involved, (b) whether by "tolerance" is meant non- injury, injury, or a lethal level, and (c) what physical and biological variables are involved, including body orientation and type of restraint. Further, although a specific magnitude, such as a "AO G" or a "9 G" impact, is commonly used to provide a relative reference point, in fact such numbers may be meaningless without also specifying time duration, onset rate, and other conditions. Crash impact (abrupt linear acceleration, deceleration) is characterized by forces of very rapid onset, high magnitude, and short duration (less than 0.2 seconds (200 ms) (36). This is in contrast to the relatively low forces and long time durations which occur in emergency braking of a vehicle. On dry pavement and under ideal conditions, "panic" braking reportedly averages only 0.3 G for 1.0 seconds at 12.07 km/h (7.5 mph) to 0.5 G for 8.2 seconds at lAA.8 km/h (90 mph) (AO) . In an aircraft crash there will usually be three separate physical phenomena. First is the initial impact of the airframe structure (gear, wing, or bottom of fuselage, for example) with another object. This secondarily results in the unrestrained passenger colliding with the interior structure, although this will usually occur significantly later in time as compared to the initial structural contact. This "second col 1 i s i on" (A8-5I) » a collision between the body and structure, may also occur when the occupant is ejected through a window or opening in the structure and impacts the ground or another object. More recently, a "third collision" has been identified as the interaction and displacement of the body organs of the individual produced by the restraint system of the restrained occupant, and collision with another structure may or may not also occur (52-53) . Injury Levels - The "tolerance" of the individual who has been subjected to the above mechanisms is determined by the nature, extent, and severity of injury received. Human impact tolerance has been defined in several different ways and different researchers have established different end points as criteria. These vary from a level where subjective pain occurs, to various degrees of injury, and finally a lethal level. The highest G levels reported for human tolerance on the rocket sled experiments at Holloman or Edwards invariably represented a level below that of serious injury, non- 4313</page><page sequence="3">4314 R. G. SNYDER reversible, or lethal injury. To reach such levels human surrogates, such as chimpanzees restrained by foam contoured restraints, were used. The decelerations reached levels of 147.5-IW.8 G (12,000/12,900 G/sec R.O . at 0.15 sees duration) (5*0 with no fractures, severe muscle bruising and some intrapleural and intraperitoneal adhesions. Lethal levels were reached at 175 0 to 232.75 0 (at 11,250 G/sec for O.35 sees), (survival k hrs. in extreme shock, multiple hemorrhages of heart and lungs). One test reached the lethal level at 2A7 G (37) • Due to the variation in the end-points of tests, caution should be used in indiscriminately citing G forces without also stating the conditions under which the tests were conducted. At one end of impact tolerance is the level where the subject begins to feel uncomfortable. Bierman, for example, defined tolerance as "that value of impact or load which produces a painful react i on" (55) • Stapp has used criteria defined as the limit beyond which either the subject or experimenter voluntarily fears to go lest there be serious injury. Note that the principal investigator of human voluntary deceleration tests usually uses himself as the first subject and for tests the results of which may be uncertain. The hazards confronting the investigator are not only in such spectacular feats as Col. Stapps1 rocket sled runs to probe the voluntary extreme, but in unrecognized and unpublished tests such as those of Zaborowski, who in 1957 nearly drowned when it took assistants longer than calculated to reinove him post-test from the experimental water restraint tube system being tested. Errors and miscalculations sometimes occur, despite triple redundancy and double safety factors, as when Beeding was subjected to a rearward deceleration of 82.6 G (3826 R.O., O.52 secs), measured at the chest (56-57) » approximately 25 percent higher loading than intended. Regarding the voluntary nature of human tests, Taylor has noted the if tolerance is defined as that point at which 50 percent of the general population refuses to be tested further, then 1 G is the limit, for fewer than 50 percent are willing to be subjected to a single test impact (58). Severity scales or indexes have been developed for use in making objective comparative clinical evaluations. Thus subjective terms such as "serious," "moderate," or "severe" can be quantified. If an individual can recover, the injury is generally considered reversible; if the limits are exceeded, it may be non-revers i bl e. Yet even a non-reversible injury, such as rupture of the blood vessels of the eye, is not necessarily a fatal or even debilitating injury. In an early NASA study of tolerances, E i band defined an impact exposure exceeding the limits of voluntary tolerance as either a debil itative or traumatic injury. A tolerable acceleration was interpreted by Eiband to mean one in which the subject is not debilitated ("a state of abnormal weakness, languor or feebleness..."), or subject to traumatic injury ("includes wounds and lesions but does not include superficial cuts and wounds, bruises or scrape abrasions...") (59)- Tests exceeding the voluntary subjective injury levels and probing the survival end-point limits of impact tolerance must use anesthetized animal subj ects . (F i g . 1) While cadavers, dummies, and mathematical analog models are also increasingly used, only the living organism has a functional physiological system. Animal tests are most productive when primates similar to man, such as the chimpanzee, are used. However, because of concern about endangered species, such tests are becoming very limited. Although man is not yet an endangered species, human use regulations have also resulted in restricting the impact testing of human subjects to the point where today there are very few civilian impact facilities "man-rated" in the country. Fig. 1 - Human tolerance usually refers to threshold of pain levels rather than Injurious or fatal trauma. Thus the range and level of survlvable Impact Is much greater than Is usually recognized. Only rarely Is the sub- Injury level acci denti y exceeded in human tests. It is significant that in analyzing results of chimpanzee tests, Stapp et al. concluded that "the survival limits for the human are probably four times the tolerance limits. Thus for design purposes structural integrity should be commensurate with survival l imi ts" (60) . PHYSICAL FACTORS Several factors or variables influence "tolerance." These physical and biological factors are inter-related. Thus one cannot meaningfully speak of an impact having a magnitude of A5 G or 9 G without also specifying other factors, since the magnitude alone does not fully describe the particular impact</page><page sequence="4">IMPACT PROTECTION 4315 01 50 1 *. - § 40 . j' r Airplane Floor / '/ r j - Barrier Crash ^ sec^^ ° TOO^" 150 it 250 n 400 Fig. 2 - A comparison of impact pulses of 16 degree crash of low-wing air transport impacting at 109 mph (175 km/h) with automobile crashing into barrier at 30 mph (48 km/h) (10, 90). environment. This is a trap which most people commonly fall into in discussing impact. Physical factors relate to variations in the duration of impact, the magnitude of the force, the rate of onset, the direction, and the distribution of force relative to the human occupant. Time Duration - One of the most critical factors in deceleration is that of the duration of time that the force is applied. In impact this generally refers to the time required to reach the peak force at initial impact. Impact by definition involves the occurrence of forces of less than 0.2 second durat ion (37) » and usually the longer the duration the more tolerable the impact. Often the crash pulse in air carrier crashes will be less than that in a typical automotive vehicle crash. This is because the aircraft generally slides a relatively long distance. On the other hand, vehicles often collide with non-yielding structures such as trees, bridge abutments, or each other. The aircraft pulse is most likely to involve a longer total time duration, greater load distribution, and less onset rate and magnitude. To illustrate this point in a general way, Fig. 2 shows an overlay of actual crash tracing of a low wing prop-driven transport impacted at a 16 degree angle with the ground at 175-4 km/h (109 mph), compared to that of a typical automotive barrier crash at 48.27 km/h (30 mph) . Note that a peak of about 50 0 occurred 75 ms after the auto impacted the barrier, while at a point 6.2 M (20 ft. 3 in.) from the nose, a peak of 15 G was recorded at 195 ms after initial impact. Another example is the comparison between jumping into water and onto a concrete sidewalk. In impacting a non-yielding surface the time duration of impact will be very short, resulting in a rapid rate of onset and high magnitude. On the other hand, in the same situation in water the time is greatly lengthened as the individual more slowly decelerates, and the magnitude and onset rate are also lower. Thus in general the longer the duration, the less the jolt and magni tude. While the expectation is that the greater the time duration of impact, the less the injury Table I - Impact Terminology.

Under rare conditions there appears to be some evidence that when the time duration is very brief - possibly less than 600 microseconds (0.006 sees) - body tissues and fluids may not have time to react as expected and survival may increase (61-63) . This sometimes happens when an individual jumps from a building onto concrete, and gets up virtually unhurt. The individual should have been seriously or fatally injured but is not. The mechan i sm(s) involved in this phenomenon are as yet not understood. Magni tude - The magnitude of force is a primary factor in measuring tolerance, but because of its i nter-rel at ionsh i p with other factors, particularly time duration and onset rate, as well as distribution and direction of force, it cannot be considered alone. Although the symbol g has been rigidly established by physicists as a symbol (go) for a specific physical quantity (32.2 ft/sec2)» the acceleration of gravity, it is often indiscriminately used in place of G in the literature. When speaking of magnitude in relation to physiological responses, the symbol G has been established in the medical literature. Physiologically, the individual's body orientation can be described in relation to the force(Fig. 2), and since 1 96 1 terms using the X, y, 2 axis have been recommended as the standard description by the Biodynamics Committee of the Aerospace Medical Panel, NATO/ AGARD (64) . Table I illustrates the equivalent termi no logy . On impact, each element of the body experiences a different G load, depending upon its elastic, plastic, and/or viscous relation to the rest of the body, to the parameters of the impact pulse, to the seat/restraint system, to the general structural characteristics of the aircraft, and many other factors. Theoretically six degrees of freedom for motion of each element would have to be measured to accurately assess the force impacted. To convert an acceleration measurement to a force measurement, one must know the mass upon which the acceleration is acting (F»ma) , but the undefined interconnections of tissues and distributed mass make such calculations inexact for the non- homogeneous human body. The maximum G forces cited in the literature for survival were calculated in the case of a 20-year-old male in excellent physical condition who jumped 65.4 m (218 feet or 21-27 stories) from the Golden Gate Bridge, landing buttocks-first on a roadway. He survived for ten days an impact calculated to be 2,064 G (or 4,128 G peak acceleration) for 0.0023 sec duration (velocity of 113-5 km/h (103 ft/sec, or 70.54), considering air drag), assuming linear deformat i on (65) . Previously, DeHaven had described a 45 m (150 foot) fall from a smokestack in which a male survived a calculated I62 G deceleration (about 300 peak G) at 22,000 g/sec for 14 ms durat i on (66) . Subsequently a large number of free-fall survivals have been documented at terminal velocity (about 193 km/h (120 mph) ) in which the magnitude greatly exceeds those in actual voluntary test conditions (which are usually terminated at the subjective pain level) (23.61-63) . Impact survival of these magnitudes are within the projected survival envelopes of von G i erke (67) and others. Peak G ("not maximum tolerable") in the upward vertical direction (+Gz) measured at the point of impact for a seated middle-aged male was found to be 220 G (44,000 g/sec for O.OO65 sec), which was attenuated to 9 G at shoulder level (68) . Comparisons of test data -are often difficult because of differences in Fig. 3 - Illustration of simple uni-axial accel-* erat ion vectors as related to the seated auto- motive occupant, with orientation described in relation to the force.</page><page sequence="6">IMPACT PROTECTION 4317 measurements, equipment capabilities, and techniques between investigators, and whether data cite "peak G," "average G," at what location (shoulder, pelvis, chest, head), and other factors. Nevertheless, the magnitude portion of a human impact survival tolerance envelope is estimated to be 4 to 10 times that of voluntary test data. Onset Rate - Abrupt impact deceleration is characterized by rapid application of force. Onset rate, or rate of onset, is usually a measure of the time it takes to reach peak G, (R0=2g/t) . It is expressed in terms of g/sec (or G/sec) and is an important variable in determining the severity of an impact. Direction of Force - The body is able to withstand impact forces in some directions better than others, which should be taken into consideration in seat design. Human tests have shown that the subjective limits for voluntary decelerations in the side-facing (to the force) body orientation are below that for either forward or rearward facing seats. In human deceleration tests the maximum voluntary impacts in the rearward-facing body position have been nearly double (83 G, at 3»800 g/sec onset rate and 0.040 sec duration) that attained in the forward facing position (47-5 G) . Tests at higher levels have also shown this relationship in injury production. It is difficult to adequately restrain and protect individuals in side-facing seats, and they are not recommended. Distribution of Force - A major way to reduce localized loading on the body is to distribute the force. Tests have shown that use of a shoulder harness can reduce the load on the lap belt by 40-60 percent. In some seats, where seat belts are anchored directly to the floor structure, an occupant can be exposed to much higher accelerative forces prior to seat/ restraint failure because of the reduced loads due to distribution. Similarly, in rearward- facing seats the force is distributed throughout the entire upper torso, resulting in a much lower unit surface pressure, instead of being concentrated at the lap belt, as i n a forward- facing impact of a lap-belted occupant. Thompson has proposed defining impact sensitivity in terms of impact force per unit area and duration (69). The design of a 60 G restraint system based upon unit surface pressures has been suggested (70). Obviously there is an important response difference between a restrained whole body deceleration and a load concentrated on a vital body area. The critical interrelationship and influence of force distribution with magnitude in particular can be demonstrated by a simple example showing that even 1 G can be fatal under some conditions. Sitting in a chair one exerts a force of 1 G (F«ma) comfortably, due in large part to the distribution of mass over a large area of the body. If one sat on a nail, in which the load is concentrated on a very small area, body penetration, pain, and injury would result, but the injury would probably be reversible. On the other hand, if one were to be lowered head-first at 1 G, onto the same nail, fatal trauma could be produced. BIOLOGICAL FACTORS Sex - Most data available from human impact tests have been conducted utilizing military (Army, Navy, Air Force) volunteer male subjects. Some tests have been conducted by university, industrial, federal civil, or private researchers, invariably also involving male subjects. Studies on a representative U.S. population, including females, at the University of Michigan did not subject volunteers to forces above 1 G. Data obtained from deceleration track tests apply to males, and to what extent they can be extrapolated to females has not been determined. However, human impact tolerances have also been studied in free-fall survival, and these cases involve both males and females. Such studies to data have concentrated upon the upper limits of human survival rather than the threshold limits of injury. Age - While military human volunteer tests have often been, and are being, conducted on relatively young male volunteers in their 20's, many such tests have also used older male subjects in their 30' s and 40' s . Since such studies may be hazardous, most investigators use themselves as subjects when greater risk may be involved. In fact, Col. Stapp was 44 years old when he made his famous rocket sled run in 1954, deceleratirig from 1 0 1 6 . 9 xm/h (632 mph) in 1.4 sec and exposing himself to 40 G peak force. Much of the injury data, particularly related to fracture loads, has been derived from cadaver tests of older subjects in their 60's and 70' s . Free-fall studies have to date provided the main body of information concerning impact to the total range of the population, including infants, children, and the elderly. A main objective in fall studies to date has been to explore the survival limits, rather than injury threshold levels, and a limitation is that usually impact forces are calculated rather than measured. However, tests utilizing the MVMA 2-D model have been conducted to simulate actual free-falls of children, in which specific trauma was known and utilizing the MVMA 2-D model. Comparison of simulation data with other reported impact experience showed that children often survived impact accelerations at levels beyond the estimated survival limits for adults (7O-7I) . Physical and Mental Condition - Little is known about the influence of physical and mental condition upon impact tolerance. Studies of skeletal and soft tissue biomechanics indicate that age may play a significant role in decreasing tolerance for a particular individual. Fracture tolerances of the lower leg (tibia) have been shown to decrease significantly between teenagers and elderly individuals. The overall physical condition of the individual at time of impact is probably important, as the body is obviously better able to cope with impact and recover faster if it is in good condition. Free-fall studies have shown</page><page sequence="7">4318 R. G. SNYDER that athletes in excellent physical condition have survived some of the most unusual falls. In some cases of extreme free-fall impact survival mental condition has been suggested as influencing the neuro-muscul ar system (e.g., drunks and psychotics may impact with muscles abnormally relaxed). RESTRAINT The degree of restraint is of primary importance. However, the seat, tie-down attachments, and restraint are all interrelated and should be designed in a systems context. The effects of their relationships will vary with, differing conditions. In a typical air carrier crash landing, impact will be primarily longitudinal to the forward-facing occupant (- Gx) , and the lap-belted passenger will continue forward in the same direction until the slack is taken up in the belt. I f he i s not wearing a belt, or if it fails in some manner, the occupant will be thrown forward at the same velocity and direction as at impact, until striking some structure. If the force is somewhere above 2-3 G's and there is no upper body restraint, the head and upper torso will continue to "jackknife" or pivot forward about the pelvis (Fig. 4) . The transfer of energy in this forward deceleration is from cabin floor structure to seat, with the restraint system and occupant interacting. If there is sufficient space the individual's head and extremities (arms and legs) will extend to their forward horizontal limits. In this case, if the body were free to move forward freely, held only by the lap belt, he would be subjected to "whole body deceleration." However, most typically the body is also subjected to localized or regional forces when the hea^ļ, arms, and legs strike other structures. Various body regions have different tolerances. Thus, for the head, skull fracture, concussion, brain damage, or contusions may occur at different levels (and may vary, from person to person, depending upon biological factors of age, sex, physique and other factors) . Some studies have indicated that bracing the body with the feet or arms may provide significant additional support. In tests of forces exerted on a footrest conducted on the Holloman AFB Daisy Decelerator, about 26 percent of the subjects' kinetic energy was absorbed by the seat; belt and 55 percent by the legs (73 » 7^) • Young male healthy subjects were able to restrain their upper body from complete jackknifing through their legs up to 15 G deceleration while wearing only a lap-belt restrai nt (75) • A Mechanism of Seat Failure - In the typical air transport impact, where the deceleration is primarily forward relative to the occupant, the arms and legs can impact significant loads on the seat structure ahead. In FAA studies conducted by the author embalmed male cadaver legs were decelerated into the backs of air transport seats. It was found the fracture of the tibia occurred at about 4448 N (1000 lbs) peak load(76). In a subsequent series of 12 FAA tests maximum peak loads ranged from 1,050 to 2,000 pounds (approximate mean value of l,48l lbs.) with male cadaver subjects ranging in age from 29 to 57 years of age (77) • In both of these studies the mounted leg pivoted about the knee joint axis to swing forward through approximately 60 degrees of arc, with strikes occurring 3 to 6 inches above the ankle joint. These figures should be viewed as conservative, since legs of young people may resist over 3»000 pounds load(78). Since the weight of the lower leg and shoe varies from 3 Kg (7 lbs), for a 45-3 Kg (100 lb) woman, to 6.8 Kg (15 lbs) for a 90. 6 Kg (200 lb) man, each leg can be expected to exert an impact force of between 3 H 3.6 and 6227-2 N (700-1,400 lhs) , for .a total of between 4,200 and 8,400 pounds. In a typical air transport seat holding three passengers at least 26688 N (6,000 lbs) loading may occur on the seat back ahead from leg impact alone. Aircraft accident investigations have Fig. 4 - Theoretical Load Analysis showing mech- anism of air transport seat failure due to addi- tional loading of upper body and extremities of lap-belted passengers jackknifing into seat ahead (79).</page><page sequence="8">IMPACT PROTECTION 4319 revealed that failure of a row of seats in the rear can result in subsequent failure of seats in front as the failed seats and passengers continue forward. in several air transport accidents in which the FAA found that the rear occupied row of seats remained intact while the occupied seats ahead broke loose, Swearingen et al. (79) calculated seat loads. A crash landing of a turbo-jet transport with a horizontal impact velocity of 172 ft/sec, decelerating to 32.2 m/s (106 ft/sec) in about 7.2 m (24 ft) in 170 ms, 10 m/s, was calculated to experience a 12 G horizontal deceleration, assuming a 10 m/s 33 ft/sec vertical velocity and I9 m (2.8 ft) crumpling of the belly structure, and the aircraft would sustain a 6 G vertical deceleration, "representative of the worst conditions which most of the latest domestic passenger seats can be expected to resist wi thout fai lure," This theoretical load analysis is illustrated in Fig. A. Loads which could be applied to seat no. 1 by its passengers were 16493 N (3,708 lbs) horizontal force, 28680.7 N (6,448 lbs) compression on the front legs of the seat, and 20460 N (4,600 lbs) tension on the rear leg attachments for two occupants. In these computations the seat weight itself was excluded as there was no precise data on weights and centers of gravity of the seats. As a result of impact of the heads and legs of the occupants of seat no. 2, total vertical tension load on the two back legs of seat no. 1 was calculated by Swaringen to increase from 20460 N (4,600 lbs) to 60777.5 N (13,664 lbs). "In other words, over two-thirds of the total force acting to pull the back legs of the seat out of the floor is imposed on the seat by the passengers in the next seat behind; yet in present day seat testing, only the loads imposed by the seat and its occupants are considered. Thus a so-called 12 G seat is probably not good for more than 3 G (horizontally) under the conditions cited above (79)." While these findings were reported in 1962, the conclusions are still pertinent since seat test requirements have not changed (FAR seat design strength requirements have not increased since 1954; related National Aircraft Standards Committee specification (NAS 809) was last updated in 1956(80). In aircraft crashes the vertical loads can be significant, and seat failure typically results in vertebral compression fractures of occupants. In rear-facing seats, in which the deceleration is principally longitudinal, the load is distributed on the back rather than on the restraint system. This is the best position for occupant protection; however imposes larger loads on the seat structure itself than do forward-facing seats. The following information summarizes whole body impact tests with human volunteer subjects. All were conducted on heajlthy male subjects, and females or children may be expected to have different tolerances under the same conditions. It should also be understood that the "tolerances" generally represented only subjective levels below the injury threshold and in no way can be equated to lethal levels or to injury levels except where indicated. LAP BELT TOLERANCES A basic question of interest to the seat design engineer and regulator (as well as the passenger), and more recently the legislator (1-5) i s , what are the human tolerance levels for lap belt restraints? An FAA Associate Admi ni strator has repeatedly testified before Congressional Committees that "Human tolerance levels are not significantly in excess of our current seat requirements, assuming only a lap belt is used," and "It simply is not true that the human body has been shown capable of withstanding significantly more acceleration than current seats are designed to wi thstand" (4, 8l) . These statements appear to conflict with previous studies by FAA medical researchers. Of particular note is a March I968 FAA staff study conducted by the Office of Aviation Medicine which concluded: "Data on human tolerance limits to deceleration (threshold of injury), when properly restrained, far exceed the ultimate inertia forces for a minor crash landing as specified in Part 25 . 56 1 . Conferees at the December I967 USAF- I ndustry Life Support Conference recommended revising the load factor for passenger seats from the present 16 G to 20 G, and that aft-facing seats be used whenever possible. "Experience has shown that survival can be expected and has occurred repeatedly at crash force levels far in excess of the minor crash landing criteria in Part 25 . 56 1 . This experience confirms the experimental data accumulated over the last two decades. In addition, survivable conditions relative to the occupi able area have been found to persist at increasingly higher crash force levels. Survivable crash force conditions in today's modern airplane are approaching the threshold limits of human tolerance to accelerative forces. Conclusions: There are no standards dealing with occupant protection in moderate to severe survivable accidents. It is concluded that human tolerance to accelerative forces is much greater than the forces generated during some of today's ' nonsurvi vabl e' accidents. We have 40 G people riding in 20 G airplanes, and sitting in 9 G seats ahd restraint systems" (8l) . The Part 25.561 ultimate inertia forces referred to are forward 9-0 g, upward 2.0 g, sideward 1 .5 g, and downward 4.5 g (9) • Injury and survival limits of human tolerance for lap belt restraint can only be estimated by mathematical model scaling techniques, using results of animal tests at higher levels, because they have not been experimentally reached. Volunteer experiments to acceleration are normally conducted in incremental increases until a level is reached where the subject feels he doesn't want to go further, or the physician medical monitor determines that it would be unsafe for the</page><page sequence="9">4320 R. G. SNYDER subject to undergo the next increment. The "tolerance" levels reported resulting from human tests therefore only approach the pain threshold (for the particular subjects tested) . They do not mean that serious or non-reversible injury will occur at that level, but rather that discomfort, minor pain, abrasions or contusions may. Seldom would a more significant injury be expected for the particular conditions reported for males. No tests except for free-fall studies are known for females, the infirm, the aged, or children, and these values probably represent an upper range for the pain threshold. In the forward-facing (-Gx) seated position, protected only by the lap belt restraint, human subjects have been voluntarily tested to 32 G (at a velocity of 4.69 m/sec (20.5 mph) with a duration of 0.001 sec. with an onset rate of 1,600 g/sec) with no significant injury (test no. 5» P- l^D (41,26). In a further series of tests Lewis and S tap p (42) concluded that minimum contusions would result when decelerative force exceeded 10 G, at 300 G/ sec rate of onset, for 0.002 sec. duration. By 13 G, at the same onset rate and time duration, soreness and muscle strain would be expected. At the highest level studied - 26 G (at 85O G/sec for 0.02 sec) - although the subject complained of severe epigastric pain lasting for 30 sec post-impact, and thoracic back strain for two days, no lasting injury was reported. In this case, a 7-6~cm (3~in) nylon military lap belt was used; impingement pressure was calculated to be 6.3 kg/sq cm (89.5 psi), and belt loads were measured at 1,946 kg (4,290 lb). Up to 15 G, these levels of time duration and onset rate have subsequently been considered safe for human volunteer subjects. The limits of these test were subjective pain lasting from 30 sees to 2 days. These data are summarized in Table II. In human deceleration tests conducted by Ryan in 1 957 • at the University of Minnesota, a subject restrained by a lap belt restraint received no injury in a forward impact of 23 G's and seat belt force of 12544 N (2,800 lbs) at 40.2km/h (25 mph) impact velocity). However, he was aslso protected by a football helmet and padding on his chest. It was concluded that a seat-belt force of 31136 N (7»000 lbs) and deceleration force of 60 G's could be sustained with "no permanent i njur ies ." (82) For the forward-facing position, with lap belt restraint only, Stapp concluded that "rates of onset betwen 250-1,600 G/sec and 11.4-32.0 peak G can be sustained against a lap belt restraint up to approximately 90 psi (6.3 kg/sq cm) average load, with no significant injuries resul t i ng ." (40) Effects of higher loads have been investigated with animal subjects, but even in tests where the lap belt was purposely positioned high and loose, 30 G peak impact (22.6 m/sec [74.2 ft/sec] entrance velocity, 3,000 G/sec onset rate, 20 deg. seat pan pitch, O.055 sec plateau time, 0.094 sec total impact duration) produced no significant injury (52). it has been found that seated human occupants restrained by a 7-6 cm (3 in.) lap belt only and subjected to aircraft crash forces can survive 30 peak G at rates of onset below 1,500 G/sec with only minor reversible injurious effects. When this is increased to more than 38 0 at 1,300 G/sec, the immediate effects of deceleration are greater than at 45 G peak at 500 G/sec (52) . However, as has been pointed out by Swearingen et al . (79) » the arcing trajectory as the body goes forward to the limits of the seat belt and then jackknifes over the lap belt is sufficiently great, so that if the torso is not also restrained, the lap-belted occupant will almost certainly strike any forward structure. And even though whole-body loads of a 32 G deceleration may have been found to be survivable with no more than minor injury, fatal injuries at far lower levels can result from the head's striking the sharp forward structure. Thus, an upper torso body restraint or rear- facing seating is necessary for most effective crash protection of the seated forward-facing air transport passenger.

While flight deck and cabin crew of air transports are required to wear shoulder restraints during takeoff and landing (and may in turbulence) to date passengers do not have such protection. While shoulder harnesses have been required since 1978 in the front seats of newly certified general aviation aircraft, they are increasingly being installed in the rear seats by the manufacturer (or owner) as optional, and in some cases as standard, equipment. This is particularly true for corporate or business aircraft. Integrated Seat Systems - Shoulder harnesses may be designed as "integrated restraint" systems, in which the belts retract into the seats when not in use. Most such systems also integrate inertia reels into the seat. Advantages of the integrated seat system are that it would allow for optimal belt angles on the occupant,- since the system would be independent of seat movement. In addition, there would be no loose belts, because when not in use they would retract into the seat, making them easier to don. Balanced against these advantages, however, are a number of disadvantages. Such seats must be constructed to contain and provide maintenance access for interior reels, retractors, or other devices, yet be built strong enough to protect against high G lpads. Since the shoulder harness would retract into the seat back above the shoulder level, the higher center of gravity during forward deceleration would require considerable structural strengthening beyond that for current ai r 1 i ne -seats . Nevertheless, this system offers some distinct packaging advantages for ease in Fig. 5 - Integrated restraint system designed and developed by the University of Michigan for the U,S. Department of Transportation (NHTSA) in 1971. passenger use. Design concepts of integrated restraint systems, first proposed in 1 909 (84), were developed and tested in a 1971 study conducted for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tests were preceeded by a series of analytical studies utilizing two- and three-dimensional mathematical models of an automobile crash victim. Additional crash tests were conducted in frontal, oblique, side, and rear tests using anthropomorphic dummies for one of these sy terns. A triple bench/bucket seat system was developed which could be utilized in a air transport aircraft. it consists of an upper torso restraint (which retracts by a inertia reel into the seat belt), side protection, and an automatically adjusting lap belt (Fig. 5) • Three other systems developed included (1) a bucket seat with airbag torso restraint and energy absorbing lower panel (e.g., a passive system), (2) bucket seat with inverted y-yoke harners (used in some sport cars), and (3) bucket seat with 3~point harness system. The integrated passenger system with shoulder harness has also been used by Chrysler Corporation in a Grumman Gulf stream G-2 Corporate Jet. As shown in Figure 5» upper torso restraint is provided by a single diagonal belt (3-point system) attached to an inertia reel contained within the seat back. When the seat is not occupied, the belt retracts out of the way. The inertia reel allows comfortable normal forward movements of the head and shoulders, locking up and restraining the upper torso only in a deceleration exceeding approximately 2-3 G. The belt is donned by buckling the lap belt and then bringing the upper torso belt down to attach (Fig. 6) at the center. In this respect it differs from the automotive 3~point belt, which generally attaches to the side. Additional protection from side (and head) imapct is provided by deep side contours. This system is very similar to the integrated restraint system developed by Robb ins et al. for NHTSA, except that in the latter system the upper torso connects to the lap belt at the side(83). NASA Integrated Air Transport Seat - Probably the state-of-the-art of air transport seats is represented by the NASA Ames Integral Aircraft Passenger seat, designed by Kubokawa (87) . Studies were initiated on this concept by NASA in I966 to analyze and propose modifications to existing commercial transport aircraft to provide improved passenger protection. This was funded under the Life Support and Protective Systems subprogram of the Human Factors System Program, a line item of the 1966 Congressional Authorization to NASA. An initial conceptual study was conducted by Stencel Aero Engineering Corporation for the "improvement of human survival in civilian aircraft emergenc i es ." (85) Examining FAA data, a definition of the boundary between a survivable and non-survi vable accident as a function of flight velocity and impact angle was determined.</page><page sequence="11">4322 R. G. SNYDER Fig, 6 - Passenger seat in corporate aircraft with retractable integrated shoulder harness. The shoulder harness is attached to an inertia! reel in the seat, allowing freedom of motion until locked by +2 G deceleration. Fig. 7 - This seat is also capable of rotating 180 degrees and can be used in a rearward-facing orientation. Crash data available indicated to them that 70 to 80 percent of ail aircraft injuries were as a result of face or head impacts to passengers as the upper torso flailed forward in a crash. Following lap belt dynamic tests of 5th and 95th percentile dummies, it was concluded that allowing excess seating clearance for unrestrained torso motion was neither economically feasible nor safe for the passenger, and that head and torso restraint of the airline passenger was a safe and practical way to protect against flail injuries. Interior survival for the passenger was focused on energy absorbing seat design (86). The integrated restraint concept has been a basis for the air carrier passenger seat under development by NASA since 1 968 . This system features a double upper torso harness ana lap belt with inertia reels, although the upper torso harness does not retract into the seat. The NASA Ames design effort arose from an attempt to provide maximum safety, comfort, and protective features for the airline passenger into a single seat design, and to demonstrate that "steps can be taken to prevent future airline crash fatalities or passenger injuries which can be attributabhle directly to inadequate seat des i gn." (87) An in-depth design, fabrication, and impact analysis was conducted to design passenger protection in high G impacts (20 -Gx horizontal, 36 +Gz vertical, and 16 ±Gy lateral). The method for absorbing impact energy was accomplished by a combination of stretching stainless steel cables, breaking of stitch theads, and use of a hydraulic mechanism and special Temper Foam cushions. This seat/restrai nt development undoubtedly represents the most advanced passenger seat available for future air carriers. The report by Ball et al. (88) also provides background relating to the development from 1966 to 1972. The constraints which went into this seat were as follows: (1) Not to exceed the dimensions of the new generation aircraft seats (B-7^7# L-101 1 ,DC-10, B-2707 S ST) . (2) Not weigh over 2.3 kg (5 lb) more than the new generation aircraft seats - present single seats weigh 28.6, 22.7» and 19.5 kg (63. 50, and kļ lb) first class, to 13*6 kg (30 lb) economy class . (3) Be able to attenuate 20 G in the vertical direction (+Gx) (it was tested to 21 -Gx successfully). (4) Be able to withstand at least 36 G in the vertical direction (±Gz) (it was successfully tested at kļ +Gz) . (5) Be able to withstand at least 30 in the lateral direction (±Gy) . (6) Not exceed 106*7 cm (k2 in) pitch (normally allowed for present overseas flights). Pitch is the distance from the back of one seat to the back of the seat directly in the front or the rear . (7) Incorporate all the safety and human engineering features as recommended by NASA, Ames Research Center. (8) Be comfortable when seated for long periods. (9) Be constructed with nonflammable material (i.e., cushion, upholstery, etc.) , and (10) Incorporate the new NASA Ames restraint system. The unsafe features of currently used airline seats were made a basis for studying improvements which resulted in the NASA Ames</page><page sequence="12">IMPACT PROTECTION 4323 Fig. 8 - The NASA Ames integral aircraft passenger seat. The food tray slides back into the side. seat. A list of 21 negative safety features of current airline seats, and 11 additional safety hazards associated with present seats in aircraft crashes was noted. The NASA Ames airline seat (Fig. 8) is composed of two major elements, as well as special impact attenuating and passenger comfort equipment. An inner seat consists of an aluminum structure with a fixed seat angle of 105 degrees between the seat pan and seat back. The seat pan is at a 6 degree incline from the horizontal when in the normal upright position. The inner seat, including both seat pan and back, can be placed in a confortable reclining position up to 12 degrees further by depressing a seat positioning switch and leaning back. The entire inner seat reclines from a single pivot point, while in present air carriers only the back of the seat reclines. The outer shell, which fastens to the floor, is the primary structure to which the impact attenuating devices and the inner seat are attached. The outer shell is an aluminum structure formed over with fiberglass and bolted to the aircraft floor. The shell is padded on either side and provides passenger protection from lateral jostle and free-flying objects during impact. As shown in Fig. 9, various locations of the outer shell house the lights, attache case compartment, stereo speakers, food tray, warning indicators, volume balance, sound control, stewardess call, light control, seat control switches, and ash tray. The padded inside top area of both sides of the outer shell house the stereo speakers and lights. The armrests are constructed as part of the outer shell and the food tray is built into the left armrest, eliminating many hazards. The double torso belt with inertia reel seat belt restraint has been demonstrated to restrain a passenger safely at 22 G in the horizontal direction without submarining or ejection. In the NASA seat design, the peak load energy is absorbed by the stretching of energy absorbing cables and the activation of other energy absorbing mechanisms located between the inner and outer seat structures. The four portions of this structure include upper vertical and lower horizontal assemblies of Type 10U stainless steel wire, a pivoting hydraulic cylinder used to allow the fixed length cable to move with the inner seat, a nylon restraint webbing with specially stretched patterns, an outer shell structure, and inner energy absorbing seat cushions. The cushions were specially produced of temper foam. Impact tests were conducted oh four prototype seats in three series (86.90). The first series was conducted in June, 1970 at the AVSER dynamic crash facilities of Dynamic Science, a division of Marshall Industries, in Phoenix, Arizona, utilizing test equipment made available by the^U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Laboratory at Ft. Eusti s, Vi rg i n i a (89) . A second series of tests were conducted on two new seats in October 1971 at the FAA's Civil Aeromedicai Research Institute (CAMI) at Oklahoma City, and a third series of vertical tests were conducted at CAMI in March 1972 to US +Gz levels. The NASA Ames airline passenger seat has been found to attenuate G loads of 21 -Gx and US +Gz, or over twice the horizontal capability and 10 times the vertical capability of present</page><page sequence="13">4324 R.

The capability of this seat has been well documented and it would appear that field testing in selected air carrier operations would have been the logical next step ten years ago. Although NASA had shown the way through design, fabrication of prototypes, and the conduct of both static and dynamic impact tests, in cooperation with FAA, none have had further development or been produced by manufacturers. The FAA applicable FAR/s do not require that passenger seats be this protective. This seat/restraint system has been designed specifically for airline passenger use, and it appears to have been the first to have such an extensive research effort in development. Yet some questions still need resolution. What use will the 20 G seat be when the aircraft starts to fall apart around 14-17 G? (Present floor anchorages are only, desi gned for 9 G stress.) Is it economically feasible for airline use? (There is no weight penalty over current first class seats.) Will the air carriers or airframe manuf acturers be willing to spend the funds necessary to restress the floor attachment points for new aircraft seats? What about passenger acceptance? The prototype seat reclining mechanism was electromechanical and the second was mechanical -hydraul i c. Perhaps a simple nonspring loaded mechanical system would be even more desirable. SHOULDER HARNESS TOLERANCES Upper torso restraint has been found to increase whole-body human tolerance limits (for young male subjects) to approximately 50 G peak (at 500 G/sec rate of onset for 0.25 sec duration) (32) . Stapp has reported "Abrupt decelerations of 50 G's can be sustained without loss of consciousness or injury and impact of more than 100 G's can be survived." (Al) Changes in the onset rate have been found to have direct effects upon human response for var i ous i mpu Ì se dur at i ons (91). Peak acceleration of approximately 45 G (O.O9 sec at 500 G/sec) resulted in no sign of human voluntary shock, yet 38 G for 0.I6 sec abov~ 1,300 G/sec produced severe delayed effects (run 215) (32). Detailed data on these two runs are provided in the following Table IV(32,39). Air Force design recommendations have been given as 45 G for a duration of 0.1 sec or 25 0 for a duration of 0.2 sec. Restraint in the experiments establishing these limits was by means of a double shoulder harness of 7«6 cm (3- i n) width, a seat belt with thigh straps, and chest belt. Even greater tolerance has been found in tests with more optimum protection. Chimpanzee tests corroborate findings from human free-falls that forward-facing whole-body tolerance with optimum full-body restraint may be about 237 G (at 11,250 G/sec for 0.35 sec), and about 247 G (at 16,800 G/sec over 0.35 sec) (38). Persistent injury was found above 135 G (at 5.00 G/sec for 0.35 sec), although transient injury effects were observed at 60 G (at greater than 5,000 G/sec) (33.34) . From these data it is clear that there is a considerable range between the region of human voluntary exposure tested and the known region of injury. BODY ORIENTATION Rearward Facing Seats - Since it has been well established that human tolerance to rearward-facing impact (+Gx) is comparably greater than for other seating orientations, there have been a number of attempts to design air transport passenger seats rear-facing. In fact, one of the earliest U.S. air transports, the Northrop "Alpha" 2 of 1931. which pioneered modern all-metal construction and featured a stresed skin, provided space for six passengers in rear-facing seats, while the pilot flew from an open cockpit located towards the rear and on top of the fuselage (Fig. 9)* While some seats in many air carrier configurations through the years have been rear-facing, it was some 20 years later before a commercial airline utilized an aircraft where all the passenger seats were rear-facing. This occurred on a North American Airlines Douglas DC-6 flight into LaGuardia, New York, in May 1953 (92) . The research data appear to overwhelmingly substantiate that the seated occupant can tolerate much higher crash forces when oriented in the rearward-facing (+Gx) position. There has been a great deal of controversy concerning rearward-facing seating in the past. Experimental deceleration studies using animals and human volunteer subjects have demonstrated that the occupant is able to tolerate greater forces in this orientation. However, comparison of the protective advantages of rearward-facing seating in operational conditions has been difficult to objectively determine since few accidents have occurred in which passengers were facing rearward and, of these, most have involved propeller-driven aircraft (93~97) • NACA analyses resulting from experimental</page><page sequence="14">IMPACT PROTECTION 4325 Fig. 9 - The 1931 Northrop "Alpha" 2 air transport, featuring rearward-facing seats for the six passengers. (Courtesy United Airlines) Curtiss C-A6 and Fairchild C-82 crashes in the 1950* s resulted in objective considerations in support of the need for improved seating, with indications that properly installed rearward- facing seating could be advantageous (98- 100) . Early studies by the Royal Air Force, particular ly (97» IOI-IO3) had strongly recommended the increased protection for passengers in rearward-facing seats. Fryer (103) notes that "...it was soon realized during the second World War that those seated in aft-facing positions with adequate head support could tolerate higher crash forces than their forward-facing colleagues. This can be attributed to the distribution of the decelerating force over a much larger and more suitable surface than that covered by the conventional harness." The RAF Transport Command conducted tests by Pekarek (IOM and Dudgeon (105* IO6) , subsequently introduced 25 G backward-facing seats, for passengers were "...slight but in major crashes the advantages of the rearward-facing position are both theoretically and practically proved to be considerable." (101) Since 19^6 rearward-facing seats for passengers have been installed in all Royal Air Force transport aircraft brought into service (97). and 16 G rearward-f aci ng passenger seats have been specified for USAF transport aircraft since 1951 (9^.107.108). During the early 1950' s some European airlines had begun to provide rearward-facing passenger seating. In 1 9^7 the U.S. Army Air Force Transport Command modified two aircraft for transcontinental flights with all passenger seating rearward-facing (95) • Questionnaires from 1,020 passengers were analyzed and it was found that the subjective results were overwhelmingly in favor of the change and indicated no discomfort or adverse reaction to this type of seating. It was recommended that an adequately stressed aft-facing seat be designed, all operational air transport aircraft be modified for rear-facing passenger seating, and a recommendation made to "...include in specifications for future transport aircraft the principle of rearward-facing seats." It is also interesting to note that this miliary staff study summarized its findings in rather direct language: "If the rearward seating principle is disregarded, these passengers will die. It may well be economically unfeasible to modify present aircraft, but when lives are balanced against dollars, there can be no excuse to continue designing new aircraft without embodying the safety factor." Appended to the staff report in a letter of transmittal of 5 May 19^7 (109) were results of the questionnaires. U.S. Navy passenger aircraft which are carrier qualified must carry passengers rearward-facing, but otherwise forward-facing seats are utilized. In 1955 the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics established a study "which would support the selection of either the forward or aft seating arrangements for passenger type aircraft based on a comparative evaluation under crash load conditions." (110) In this series of tests, eight experiments utilized two male volunteers of approximately the 5tn and 95th percentile stature dimensions,</page><page sequence="15">4326 R. G. SNYDER exposed to 2 to 5 G (.25 to .37 sec at 1,100 G/ sec) while seated in two type MIL-S-7877B Weber transport seats. The tests were intended to go to 8 G; the reaction at 5 G in the forward- facing seat precluded lap-belt-only forward- facing decelerations above 5 G, although dummy tests subsequently went to $.2 G. On the basis of this comparison it was concluded that "a passenger seated in the aft- facing position can better withstand the effects of rapid deceleration because his body and head receive support from the entire back of the seat.11 (110) It was recommended that the aft- facing passenger seat be retained in military passenger type aircraft with four modifications. The modifications included adding an adjustable back mechanism to the right armrest, adding a 2.5 cm (1 in) ensolite padding across the lower back cross member to eliminate bottoming, reanalyzing the seat design to see if additional bracing was needed, and providing a stop plate under the seat to prevent "jackkn i f i ng" of the passenger's legs. A 1966 series of tests conducted by the FAA (CAM I) also support the 1 96 1 Navy study recommending rearward-faci ng seating, although for different reasons. Dynamic impact tests of instrumented anthropomorphic dummy heads into the backs of current models of forward-facing air transport seats showed that portions of some seats have good deformation character i st i es . However, Swearingen (111) considered "lethal design" features to include tubular construction, rigid serving trays, rigid seat arms protruding rearward between seats, and excessive break-over forces. In impact tests against the backs of eight different airline seats at 9-1 m/ses (30 ft/sec) impact velocity, Swearingen concluded that 30 percent would have been fatal, 80 percent would have produced facial fractures, and 97 percent would have rendered the passenger unconscious. In only three percent of these head impacts would the passengers have escaped unconsciousness or injury. The USAF 16 "g" passenger seat requirement including shoulder harness or rearward-facing seats was adopted in 1 95 1 (Technical Instruction 2140, Installation of Seats and Shoulder Harness in USAF Aircraft). The G factor was based upon a II3.4 kg (25O lb) occupant (thus l,8l4kg [4,000 lb] ultimate load in a lé G seat). (Note that the FAA TSO-C39 provides only for a 694 kg [1»530 lb] ultimate load for a 77 • 1 kg [ 1 70 lb] occupant in a 9 G seat.) In 1 95 1 the first 66O rearward-facing seats were delivered, and the first were installed in a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-97 aircraft by Lockheed Engineering Company. This aircraft made its first flight on 11 June 1951» Subsequently all MATS Boeing C-97 aircraft were modified with 16 G rearward-facing seats as they received 1,000- hour inspections. The Air Force Systems Command Handbook of Instructions for Aircraft Design (AFSCM80- 1) section 2.1 related to passenger seats states: "Install all passenger seats to face rearward and locate them to the rear of any cargo carried. Comply with the 16 'g' strength requirements of Ml L-S- 26688 (I08) for passenger seats on transport aircraft which are used alternately for carrying cargo and passengers and install them to meet the requirements in M I L-A-8865 . . . . " The USAF/NASA design handbook (AFSC DH1-6 System Safety, fourth edition, 20 July 1974) specified: "The maximum protection from impact forces on the body is provided by rearward-fac i ng seats. Use these seats for all psssengers and for crew members whose duties do not require them to face forward" [302.1 Seat Orientation ( 1 07) • Currently the USAF Military Airlift Command (MAC) primarily utilizes rearward-facing seating in its Lockheed C-141A Starlifter and Boeing C- 1 35 troop transport, but not all seats are rear-facing. In the C- 141 a standard seating arrangement is 46 three-place rear-facing seats ( 1 38 occupants) with a comfort pallet, or 120 troops in three-place rear-facing seats when a comfort pallet is available. Such seats have either 5-1 cm (2 in) or 7-6 cm (3 in) lap belts with no shoulder harness, and are stressed for 16 G impact loads. However, other passenger configurations include litter arrangement (head-first body orientation) and in cases where paratroops are carried, the rear- facing seats may be repalced by four sections of side-facing net seats. There is also a modification of this arrangement (C- 1 4 1 A Kit #1) consisting of one row of inboard-facing canvas seats positioned along each side of the cargo compartment (T.O. 1-C-141A-1) . The USAF Boeing C- 1 35 cargo carrier or troop transport and KC-I35 tanker is primarily used with the Strategic Air Command, and has provisions for up to 135 passengers. Military Airlift Command also operates five Boeing VC-I37B and Boeing VC-137C models, modified from the Boeing 707 civil air carrier version, with a crew of seven or eight and 50 passengers which is used for the President and government officials. Although USAF aircraft are not required to operate under FAA airworthiness bulletins, the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews AFB, Maryland, which operates the VC aircraft, is the only military unit in the USAF operating under FAA standards as well as USAF standards, and operates its own FAA certified repair station [Covault, 1974 (65; 736)]. A typical SAC configuration includes both cargo and passengers with ten rear-facing seats aft of the cargo area, equipped with either 5-l~cm- or 7.6-cm-wide (2 or 3 in) lap belts. There are also provisions for carrying 55 troops in folding nylon side-facing seats positioned along each side of the fuselage and in the tail section. When no cargo is carried, the USAF Boeing C- 1 35 passenger configuration consists of 42 aft-facing track-mounted triple seat units mounted on either side of the fuselage for six- abreast seating, for 126 rear-facing passengers. When the aircraft is utilized for aero-medical evacuation, 44 litters and eighteen triple aft- facing seat units for 54 passengers can be mounted.</page><page sequence="16">IMPACT PROTECTION 4327 Rearward-facing passenger seats used in Air Force transport aircraft are designed to withstand crash loads of 16 G in the longitudinal axis in accordance with Military Specifications MIL-S-26688, while seat attachments to the aircraft floor, as well as the floor structure, are also designed to carry these loads (M I L-A-008865~USAF) . However, recent budget constraints have not allowed the USAF to retrofit many air transports such as the KC-10, designed under FAA civil standards rather than military specifications. Thus, while not all USAF passengers, even in the Lockheed C- 141 or Boeing C-135» travel in aft-facing seats, this is the predominant passenger orientation for most operations. The Royal Air Force has utilized rearward-f ac i ng seating for passengers in the VC-10 transport, Comets, Brittanias, Belfasts, and some Hercules transports; however, the RAF has reported no experience to date with these aircraft where passengers have been subjected to impact deceleration in rearward-facing seats. Rear-Facing Passenger Accident Experience - Accident comparisons between rear- and forward- facing occupants has now extended over three decades, and provide some basis for discussion. No attempt is made within the limitations of this paper to research or update all of the most recent data, but such experience is a valuable consideration when evaluating human tolerance data. Not all analyses of rearward-facing seating have been favorable. In a 1958 study by Boeing, air transport accidents were evaluated on the basis of fatalities alone. "The reason for this simplification is that added classifications tend to confuse the analysis and may lead to erroneous conclusions. A passenger who has suffered serious injuries still enjoys life, irrespective of how long it may take to completely recover. Even if only partial recovery is obtained, he still lives. Therefore, there is very little possibility of distorting statistics by using this simple comparison. It leads to more direct answers" (112). Advantages and disadvantages of rear vs forward-facing seating were compared based upon fatalities in prior crashes, and it was concluded that rearward seating would "not have made any significant difference in passenger fatality record. (112) A different conclusion was reached in a 1962 North American Aviation engineering study of air transport crash injury prevention and seating. Hegenwald (113) concluded that rearward facing seats provided superior protection to that of a forward-facing seat with lap belt, that dynamic tests were necessary, and that improved crashwor th i ness of seats can be achieved without economic weight or performance penalities if the design is considered early in the aircrafts development. He also concluded "If forward facing seats must be installed, shoulder harnesses should be provided in addition to lap belts. ..or a seat spacing pitch of 50 to 60 inches should be furnished..." This study recommended the following design loads (ultimate), as measured on basic aircraft structure at the point of seat and equipment attachment for design of air transport seats: a) "Forward inertial loading, applied longitudinally and, relative to the aircraft's longitudinal center line, 60 degrees below, 15 degrees above and 30 degrees to each side: 25 g for 0.20 sec at onset of 8OO g/sec 9 9 for 0.A0 sec at onset of 300 g/sec, b) aftward inertial loading, applied long i tudual 1 y , 10 g for 0.20 sec at onset of 500 g/sec (113)." Investigation of casualties and fatalities in a study of 20 crash landings in Consolidated B-2A type aircraft indicated that persons in the rear were seven times less likely to be fatally injured, three times less likely to have serious injury, and three times more likely to have no injury as passengers or crew forward of the leading edge (93)« In 195A the Royal Air Force reported results of eight years' experience with rear-facing seats in all RAF military transports required since the end of World War II. Comparisons were made between four types of RAF Transport Command two-engined Dakotas and four- engined Yorks (both having mainly forward-facing seating) and two-engined Valettas and four- engined Hastings (primarily aft-facing seating) for the years 1 9^6- 1 953 • For this period 21.5 percent of passengers involved in forward-facing seating (substantial damage or destroyed Dakota or York aircraft) were fatally or seriously injured, while in comparison, only 6. A percent of the rearward-facing passengers (Valettas and Hastings) were fatally or seriously injured (97) . Subsequently, a USAF study of accident data from all USAF Transport accidents over a 2-1/2 year period (1955"57) resulted in finding that injuries to those passengers facing forward were seven times greater than received by those facing to the rear. (11 A) Of 3tl08 occupants in survivable military transport accidents during this period, 2,990 received no injuries, including almost 100 percent of those facing to the rear. Four percent of those forward-f ac i ng received major injuries .and I.3 percent of those forward-facing were fatally injured. Data for both high impact and "survivable" air transport accidents showed that 98.3 percent of passengers facing rearward received no injuries. In comparison, 11.1 percent of those in forward- facing seats were killed and A. 5 percent received major injuries. Predominant injuries to aft-facing passengers involved the extremities. At that date the USAF reportedly used rearward-facing seats for all aircraft used strictly for air carrier use. An Air Force Convair C-I3I equipped with rear-facing passenger seats crashed short of the runway at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma in 19&amp;2. Investigation revealed that injuries to several occupants were attributed to incorrect installation of several sets of armrests on rearward-facing seats which permitted failure of</page><page sequence="17">4328 R. G. SNYDER the seat back in a moderate force accident (115) . One previously described accident involved a Boeing KC-135A which made a 3~engine approach and crashed short of the runway with 56 crew and passengers abroad, destroying the aircraft in the post-crash fire. This aircraft had 26 rear-facing seats aft of the cargo section. Although evacuation was accomplished in kS seconds, 11 passenger fatalities were attributed to effects of fire and smoke. Of the 12 occupants injured, no rearward-seated passengers were reported to have received impact injuries. In a accident on 5 April 1975 in Vietnam, a USAF Lockheed C-5A crashed near Saigon when the aft cargo door and ramp blew off in decompression and severed the flight controls as a result of the locks on the rear cargo door and ramp coming unlatched in flight. Of 330 persons aboard there were reported to be 155 survivors some occupying rearward-facing seats (116). Air Force accident experience with Lockheed C-141 and Boeing C- 1 35 aircraft were analyzed by Snyder and Robb ins in an USAF study in 1971, (117) and world-wide civil air transports were published in a NATO study in I976. ( 1 1 8) The latter report should be referred to for more detailed seat developent data than are provided in this paper. There has been a C- 141 accident in Australia involving rear-facing passengers, and isolated air carrier accidents where some occupants have been seated in rear-facing seats, unfortunately information is limited relative to operational accident experience in current jet air carriers. In 1969 as result of an FAA Office of Aviation Medicine staff review of accident experience and adequacy of the existing air transport, and proposed V/STOL tentative airworthiness Standards for Transport category, one major recommendation was to "require, where practicable, aft-facing seats (8) . It has been shown that current air transport cabin structureas can remain resonably intact at crash force levels of 20 G (for 23 msec at rate of onset of approximately 1,500 G/sec) , which is considerably less than the rear-facing human occupant can tolerate. The 16 G seat, originally designed by the Aeromedicai Laboratory of the USAF Air Material Command, contained aluminum sheet structure 6.8 kg (15 lb) lighter than the 6 G seat it replaced. The 1967 USAF Industry Life Support Conference concluded that human tolerance to +Gz probably exceeds 50 G. This conference recommended revising the load factor to 25 G for crew seats and 20 G for passenger seats, and that aft- facing seats be used wherever possible (1 19) . More recent studies by von Beckh (120) have reported that during the post-decompression emergency descent of mul ti -mach high-altitude aircraft the occupants will be subjected to deceleration-induced inertial loads in the direction of the flight path which will reach or exceed 0.5 6. In such a situation ne reports that f orward-f ac i ng passengers who have not been able to don the oxygen mask may lose consciousness for various periods of time and will assume positions which are not favorable for the recovery from hypoxic stress. On the other hand, von Beckh recommends a reassessment of the value of aft-facing seats since aft- facing passengers, even if unconscious, would still be supported by their seat back and would be forced into an advantageous (for recovery) semisupine position by the combined effect of the aircraft's negative altitude angle and the decelerative load. This work points up a new advantage of aft-facing passenger seats particularly pertinent in today's high-altitude passenger f 1 i ghts . The major advantage of rearward- facingimpact protection is that the crash loads are distributed over a larger portion of the body. This results in less load per unit area, and increases the capability of the occupant to withstand greater crash forces than were he seated in a forward-facing lap-belted position. However, this raises the center of gravity and loads the seat back higher, thereby stressing the seat back and tie-down anchorages greater than in the forward-facing position. This requires a stronger seat and stronger attachments due to the higher loading. A passenger seat cannot simply be turned around and perform adequately in a crash. The requirement for greater seating strength for rearward-facing seats does not, however, necessarily mean that it will be more costly or weigh more. Tests conducted by the Air Force have shown that the l6 G rearward-facing seat was6.8kg (15 lb) lighter than the 6 G forward- facing seat it replaced; the 1972 NASA-Ames seat, which attenuated ten times the vertical load required by current regulations, weighed no more than current first class seats, and other developments by NASA and FAA are underway have also indicated that stronger, lighter seats can be built with today's technology. Time motion studies were made by Stapp and Lewis of 20 subjects exposed to 6 G and 12 G in aft-facing and forward facing seating, and resulted in recommendations regarding rearward seating of transport passengers in relation to escape from survivable crashes (121,122). The concerns expressed by some individuals that people do not like to ride rearward in an aircraft have not been substantiated in past studies (8,87.93» 95) • In the 1971 evaluation of USAF transport aircraft seating, the rearward- facing Boeing C- 1 35 and Lockheed C-1A1 l6 G seats were found to offer substantially better occupant crash protection over any other civil airline passenger seats in use (117). There seems to be ample evidence that current technology can provide rearward-facing seats with even lighter weight, greater strength, and at relatively less cost per unit than current rearward-facing seats. Review of all pertinent impact test data strongly supports the considerably increased crash protection offered to the occupant seated in a rearward-f ac i ng seat.</page><page sequence="18">IMPACT PROTECTION 4329 Table IV.

REAR-FACING TOLERANCES Rearward-facing (+Gx) impact tolerances are considerably higher than for either forward- or side-facing positions, primarily due to the greater distribution of loading throughout the entire back area of the seated occupant, and thus the lower N/sq cm (psi) per unit area. This results in greater stress on the seat back which must be constructed to fail at higher levels than a forward-facing seat. While the limits for survival and injury in rearward-facing body orientation has not been clearly established, the lower threshold without injury for young male occupants so protected has been reported to be AO G peaks at 30 G for 0.11 sec duration when calculated rate of onset is 1,065 G/sec(3D; and AO G G peaks at 2,000 G/sec with severe but transient physiological responses (36) . To date, a level of 83 G (chest acceleration) , at 3*800 G/sec for O.OA sec duration, has been tolerated with transient injuries reported (107) • Other evidence from free-falls and sub- human primate tests have indicated that survival tolerances may be more than three times higher (10, 22, 3A, 39) • While these findings apply to healthy young males under carefully controlled conditions, it also must be taken into consideration that these levels are below that at which injury occurs and do not represent the human tolerance limits for reversible, non- reversible, or fatal injury. In order to develop tolerance information applicable to other segments of the population it is necessary to extrapolate from other data sources. To date free-falls, which i nel úde every segment of the population and all conceivable conditions, are one source. Another is extrapolation from animal studies, scaling by mathematical analogs. The accepted U.S. Air Force design limit is A5 -Gx for a duration of 0.1 second or 25"Gx for a duration of 0.2 second in rear-facing impact. Table V! summarizes the available human data. For more detailed information the original reports should be reviewed. SIDE-FACING TOLERANCES Many corporate aircraft and some air transport configurations provide some side- facing seats for passengers. Knowledge of human response to lateral deceleration forces (±Gy) is very limited, but tests to date strongly indicate that tolerances are lower for this position than for either forward- or rearward- facing body orientations. This is reflected in a change in SAE Aeronautical Recommended Practice 7^7* omitting side-facing seating recommendat i ons . The most extensive research into side- facing seating on restraint protection has been conducted by the U.S. Army, and this information is provided in the Crash Survival Design Guide (19*20). Human subjects have found the subjective pain threshold in the side-facing (±G) body orientation to be considerably lower than for forward (-Gx) , rearward (+Gx) , or vertical (±Gz) accelerations. When the individual is restrained by a lap belt only, the voluntary tolerance limit for left lateral (- Gy) impact has been reported to be only 9 G (average) for a duration of approximately 0.1 second (123~125) • Under full body restraint Sonntag (126) reported a maximum of IA.I peak sled G at 6OO G/sec for 0.122 second duration.

Only a few tests have been done on human subjects seated in the right lateral orientation (+Gy) , but in this orientation with full Mercury body restraint, the subjective tolerance has been reported to be above 21.5 G (sled) maximum for 1,190 G/sec and has 0.121 second duration (127)* Brown found that 18.7 G (sled) was tolerated with no subject complaints (128). In left impact (- Gy) Chandler tested subjects to I7-I8 G at 20-36 ft/sec impact velocity using six-strap restraint and head rest, and in an series six subjects complained of a sore neck. It is unlikely that such tests provide a realistic measure of the lateral impact pain threshold of the typical airline passenger protected only by a lap-belt. However, they do provide test data which indicates the effect of various restraints and comparison with other body positions, as well as provide threshold tolerance data. It seems improbable that voluntary tests could ever be conducted on children, the elderly, and other segments of the general population, although the military plans to initiate impact tests of women volunteers. Table VII summarizes some key test data. Comparison of Tolerance Standards - FAA Standards - Part 25-561 (Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes) provides structural design criteria to protect each occupant in a minor crash landing. The ultimate inertia forces on the occupant are given as: Upward - 2.0 g Forward - 9-0 g S i deward - 1.5 g Downward - 4.5 g ("or any lessor force that will not be exceeded when the airplane absorbs the landing loads resulting from impact with an ultimate descent velocity of five f.p.s. at design landing we i ght") . A recent studv has traced the development of the Federal Air Regulations related to seat, restraint, and crash protection from the first Air Commerce Regulations of December 3 U 1926, the modifications in the wording that have occurred, and analyzed their origins (131) • This should be referred to for more detailed information, but is not within the scope of this paper. An important point often overlooked is that the ultimate inertia forces criteria (originally specified in 1945) originated from the airframe structure rather than that of the human occupant. The basic load factors of fuselage strength dating back to 1 926 required load factors of 4.5 to 6.5» while structural strength of landing gear in the 1 926 requirements called for a side load of 1 .5 times the (airplane) weight (55 years later the sideward impact design criteria remain the same). The point is that the criteria specified in Part 25.561 were never derived from human biological tolerance considerations. Other primary requirements for seat/ restraint certification are found in Part 25-785 (Seats, Berths, Safety Belts, and Harnesses), Part 25.1413 (Safety Belts), Part 25-625 Table VII.

There have been a number of studies, particularly over the past 20 years, that have concluded that the protec i ton afforded air transport passengers as specified as minimum standards in 25*561 is not consistent with that needed • Analysis of 61 survivable aircraft crashes by the Flight Safety Foundation in 1 967 indicated that nearly half of the 1,037 fatalities and serious injuries probably could have been prevented by the use of improved restraint systems (4). In 1 967 Turnbow (139) recommended design loads for seats and lap belt restraint systems for fixed-wing transport ai rcraf t of 2 TABLE VIII.

This FAA staff report stressed that "data on human tolerance limits to deceleration (threshold of injury), when properly restrained, far exceed the ultimate inertia forces for a minor crash landing as specified in Part 25,561." More recently the National Transportation Safety Board has published a Special Study entitled "Cabin Safety in Large Transport Aircraft" (7), which presents a careful analysis of 77 air transport accidents. It provides documentation on seat failures found in recent investigations. This report noted 17 conclusions important in consideration of seat strength versus human tolerance. These included the following: "seat systems" are failing in accidents/incidents where the acceleration forces acting on the aircraft and occupants are less than the design forces prescribed in 14 CFR 25.26I"; (2) "human tolerance to abrupt accelerations when restrained by lap belt only is two to three times greater than the force levels cited in 14 CFR 25*561"; (3) "most of the survivable and partially survivable accidents/ incidents analyzed in this study involve acceleration forces acting on the aircraft and occupant that are in excess of the levels cited in the regulations"; (A) "the fuselage structure of current aircraft is able to provide adequate protection for occupants in accidents involving forces considerably in excess of the requirements of 14 CFR 25*561," and (5) aircraft occupants are being injured and killed because of the failure of seat/restraint systems and other cabin furnishings in survivable and partially survivable accidents." These conclusions clearly support the need for improved seat/restraint strength and updating the FAR 's to be more compatible with human impact tolerances. The U.S. Army Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide probably provides the most up-to- date seat design information available, and takes into consideration NASA's recent efforts in the FAA-NASA crash test program. The following table presents design pulses corresponding to the 95th percentile accident of fixed wing transport aircraft (19,20,131,132). Much of the Army's work has resulted in crashworthy seats of military helicopters (133,134). The seats are presently available only as options in a few civil helicopters. This work is directly applicable to air transport seats (135)* The design pulses provided in Table VIII are recommended for transport aircraft at the 95th percentile level, with peak G levels assumed to be imposed at the floor level near the aircraft C.G. Note that the Army's design pulses exceed the criteria provided in 14 CFR 25*561 by a factor of two to 15 times. RELATED DATA A large number of studies extending back forty years report on evaluation and development of air transport seats, but those are not reviewed here. To date there have been no reported experimental crash tests of a commercial jet transport. Recently the FAA and NASA initiated plans for a ten-year research program assisted by Lockheed, McConnel 1 Douglas, and Boeing, including further crash tests (136). This program under the direction of the crashworth i ness branch of the FAA Technical Center at Atlantic City represents the most current efforts in air transport seating crash protection, although attention will also be given to general aviation aircraft. It has been well documented that crash fatalities and injuries attributed to seat and restraint failure statistically involve significantly more people in light aircraft than in air carrier crashes (130). The FAA-NASA program will involve the crash test of a Boeing 720 aircraft, possibly by 1984. In addition, preliminary development work under contract to Simula, Inc. on experi ménta 1 transport seats is intended to evaluate energy absorbing features in the longitudinal direction and to permit interfacing with existing aircraft structure (1 37) • Tests of air transport seats related to this program have also been conducted by CAM I ( 1 38) .</page><page sequence="21">4332 R. G. SNYDER CONCLUSIONS 1. The ultimate inertia forces on the occupant specified in Air Transport Airworthiness Standards (CFR 14 Part 25*561) of 9 g forward, 1.5 g sideward, 2 g upward, and up to 4.5 g downward, were derived as structural design criteria with origins back to 1926. No documentation has been found to support a position that these figures were ever developed from any human tolerance considerations or data. The present FAA standard has no derivative relationship to the scientific body of knowledge of human impact tolerance capabilities. 2. Most human impact tolerance findings on volunteer subjects are based upon a transient subjective pain level below that where minimal injury occurs. The range and level of injury and that of survivability is much higher than the reported data. 3* Levels of human impact survival are estimated to be 4 to 10 times the maximum levels cited for human volunteer tests. This is based upon mathematical analogs of anesthes i ze.d animal tests beyond that of human volunteers, and free- fall calculations for which a large body of data exi sts . 4. There is a distinction between whole body impact tolerance of the restrained occupant and the localized or regional tolerances involving direct impact of various body members (head, legs, chest) or body tissues or organs (brain, heart, lungs, pancreas, kidneys). 5.- Human impact tolerance involves complex and inter-related physical factors of magnitude, onset rate, time duration, direction and distribution of force; and biological factors of sex, age, physical condition, and other largely unknown response factfors of nonhomogeneous body tissues, as well as bpdy orientation, restraint/ seating, and other variables. Magnitude alone is an inadequate description. 6. Human volunteer tests to date have primarily been conducted with males aged 20 to 45 years, often protected with maximum restraint, and medically monitored. Comparative tests have not yet been conducted on women. Free-fall data have provided one source of information on children, older men, the infirm, and the elderly. Cadaver studies have primarily used elderly subjects often in their 60's. Thus, assumptions about the relative tolerance(s) of these groups must be made cautiously. Limited data on children, for example, indicate survival of head impact accelerations beyond the estimated survival limits for adult males. 7* There is no single "impact tolerance." The level of "tolerance" (e.g., pain threshold, reversible injury, survival, etc.) must be specified as well as the subject, degree of restraint, and body orientation, and whether whole body or regional impact. Data are usually reported for specific conditions (e.g., young male, forward-facing, lap-belt restraint; end point subjective pain threshold) . 8. Rearward-facing seating offers the best impact protection relative to body orientation, since the load in a longitudinal crash is distributed on the upper body, resulting in much lower local forces on the body in a given crash. Provision for such seating should be considered during preliminary airframe design stages. The major arguments against such seating revolve about possible weight and cost penalities, for which there are engineering solutions. The question of public acceptance has been shown by various studies and rear-facing experience to be favorable. 9* The NASA Ames Integrated passenger seat, developed and tested between 1 966 and 1972» represents the most advanced seat designed specifically for air transport passenger comfort and impact protection. It has demonstrated dynamic impact attenuation of 21 G (-Gx) forward-facing, and 45 G (+Gz) vertically, or over twice the horizontal capability, and 10 times the vertical protection of current airline seats. Although this seat considerably exceeds FAA requirements it has not gone into operational use. 10. Human tolerance level (s) significantly exceed current FAA emergency landing certification requirements for air transport seat structure (25*561). Any significant advance in passenger impact protection will require improvement in passenger seat energy absorption capability and in strengthened seat/ restraint floor anchorage. The state-of-the-art is far in advance of 30-year-old standards. 11. In a crash landing seats struck by occupa/its in the seats behind can increase seat loading significantly. Current seat test requirements consider only the static loads imposed by the seat and its occupants. Dynamic seat tests should be conducted, giving consideration to strike loads imposed on the rear of the seats. 12. The FAA concluded more than a decade ago that "we have 40 G people riding in 2Q G airplanes and sitting in 9 G seats and restraint systems." That still appears to be an accurate generalization summarizing the status of current passenger protection in air transport aircraft. REFERENCES 1. U.S. House of Representatives "Aviation Safety.
