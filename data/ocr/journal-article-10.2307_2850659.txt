<plain_text><page sequence="1">IBN KHALDUN ON ATTRIBUTES AND PREDESTINATION* BY HARRY A. WOLFSON IBN KHALDfUN opens his sketch of the "science of the Kalam" with a discussion of two topics, the unity of God and the power of God. His purpose is to show that the belief in the unity of God is not incompatible with the belief that attributes are real incorporeal beings, eternally subsisting in God, and that the belief in the power of God, that is, in predestination, is not incompatible with divine justice in its holding man responsible for his actions. These were two distinct problems in Muslim religious philosophy. He combines these two problems and tries to solve them by one common argument. The one common argument by which he tries to solve these two problems may be briefly stated. Throughout the history of philosophy, the unity and power of God were treated as corollaries deducible from the proofs of the existence of God. So Ibn Khalduin says to himself: Let us examine the proofs for the existence of God and see what kind of unity of God and what kind of power of God are established thereby, and then let us see whether that kind of unity is compatible with divine attributes and whether that kind of power is compatible with divine justice. Accordiingly, at the very beginning of his discussion of the Kalam, after stating that the "unity" of God is the core of the articles of faith and after declar- ing that he was going to prove the unity of God in a method and manner which is "most direct,"' he proceeds to prove not the unity of God but the existence of God. Let us study Ibn Khaldtin's proof of the existence of God. In Arabic philosophy, by the time of Ibn Khalduin (1332-1406), the proofs used for the existence of God were mainly of two types. Both of these types were of the cosmological kind. We may characterize them, with reference to their ulti- mate philosophical origin, as the Platonic type of argument and the Aristotelian type of argument. The Platonic type of argument starts with the assumption that the world came to be (-yvyvo,yevov) after it had not been,2 or as the Muslim theologians have come to express this view, the world was created (makhliiq). Then, adding the principle that everything created must have a creator, it di- rectly infers that there must be a Creator. The Aristotelian type of argument starts with the assumption that the world is eternal. Then, by an empirical study of the world, it arrives at the conclusion, first, that every form of coming into being within the world is effected by a cause and, second, that since the world is eternal, the series of causes and effects would have to be infinite. Then, adding * Quotations from the Muqaddimah are from its masterly English translation in three volumes by Professor Franz Rosenthal (New York: Pantheon Press, 1958), except for occasional deviations in the case of technical terms.

As in the Aristotelian type of proof, Ibn Khaldtin starts with the empirical observation that "the things which come into being in the world of existing things . . . require appropriate causes which are prior to their coming into being" and that "each one of these causes ... requires other causes."4 But he does not go on to say, as does Aristotle, that the causes and effects would form an infinite series and that an infinite series of causes and effects is impossible. As in the Platonic type of proof, he assumes that the world was created and that consequently the series of causes and effects within it is finite. From the combination of these two types of proof he then ar- rives at the existence of God, whom he describes in terms borrowed from both these two types of proof, as Cause and as Creator. His conclusion thus signifi- cantly reads: "Causes continue to follow upon causes in an ascending order, until they reach the Causer of causes, Him who is the Author of their existence and their Creator."5 But, having started his argument with the emprical observation that things within the world are causally connected with each other, Ibn Khaldfin became conscious of a difficulty. It was well for Aristotle and for Avicenna and for all other philosophers to speak of the existence of causes in the world and of causes requiring other causes, for they all believed that God is a "Causer of causes" only in the sense that He is a Prime Cause or a Remote and Ultimate Cause, who acts upon the world through intermediate causes, so that there is a real causal nexus in the world. But Ibn Khalduin, as a follower of the orthodox Kalam, did not be- lieve in causality. To him the world was a succession of events, each of which was created directly by God. The sequence in this order of events which is ob- served is due to what the Mutakallimuin describe by the term "custom" ('adah).6 So Ibn Khaldfin, after stating that "the things that come into being in the world of existing things . . . require appropriate causes which are prior to them,"7 im- mediately corrects himself by adding with regard to those causes that "by them the things that come into being fall into the realm of custom (al-'adah)."8 This may be taken as a general explanation of all other places where he speaks of "nexuses (rubut) between causes and things caused"9 or of "the dependence (tawaqquf) of things upon each other".'0 By all these expressions he means only a conception of causality due to "custom." 3 Metaph., ii, 2, 994a, 1 if. 4 Muqaddimah, iII, p. 27,11. 7-11. 5 Ibid., 11. 12-14.

This corresponds to one of the three possible explanations of "custom" suggested by Averroes. As this explanation is phrased by Averroes, "custom" means "our custom of forming a judgment (al-4ukm) concerning exist- ing things"'5 which is "an act of the mind (al-'aql)."'6 In reality, as Ibn Khaldfin says, "all these things are connected with the divine power,"'7 that is to say, all things which through "custom" are seen to be causally connected with each other are in reality connected with God as their direct cause. But, as we have seen, Ibn Khalduin, by his own declaration, had set out to prove not the existence of God but the unity of God. Therefore, immediately after he has shown that there is a God, he adds: "There is no God but Him."''8 How the unity of God follows from his proof for His existence is explained by him later briefly that "otherwise, the creation [of the world] could not have ma- terialized, on account of mutual antagonism"'g9 or, as he phrases it elsewbere, the world "would have been destroyed."20 This refers to a well-known Kalam proof, based upon the philosophic as well as Koranic conception of one world, which argues that two deities could not cooperate in creating the world or, having cre- ated it, could not cooperate in keeping it in existence.2' With this proof for the existence of God and His unity, Ibn Khalduin, in the course of his discussion, takes up the problem of attributes. He mentions three views. First, there was the view of those who "sank deep into anthropomor- phism,"22 believing that God has hands, feet, and face,23 and that He extends in different directions and is sitting and descending and has a voice and sound.24 Sec- ond, there was the view of the Mu'tazilites, who denied not only anthropo- morphism but also "decided to deny attributes in the form of abstract nouns (.if&amp;t al-ma'aniyy), such as knowledge, power, will, life, in addition to denying Cf. the expression istimrir al-'adah in Ghazali's Tahafut al-Faldsifah, xvii, 13, p. 285, 1. 11. 12 The Arabic iqtirdn is a literal translation of the Greek aovaycowy, a bringing together, a collection, which is used technically in the sense of the conclusion in a syllogism. 13 Muqaddimah, III, p. 29, 11. 3-4. 14 Ibid., ii, p. 366, 1. 1.

According to one of these views "one is not to say of the attribute of knowledge [and for that matter of any other at- tribute] that it is God nor that it is other than God."30 According to the other view, "God's knowledge is other than God and different from God, yet in spite of this it is uncreated and ceaseless."3' Evidently these two views were held by him at different periods in his life. The former view represents that period of his life when, together with Abi HIashim, he rejected the Mu'tazilite extreme view on at- tributes and followed Abu Ilashim in his new theory of a.hwal 'states' or 'modes', for the formula reproduced in his name by Ibn Hazm is like that used by Abui Hashimn in the representation of his theory of ahwdl, according to which the so- called attributes are "states" or "modes" which are "neither God nor other than God."32 The latter view represents the later period of his life, when he was com- pletely converted to the Sunnite view, for this formula is like that used by Baqil- lan,, chief exponent of Ash'ari's later view.33 But it would seem that some follow- ers of Ash'ari, and Sunnites in general, continued to follow the earlier view of Ash'ari,34 that which is like the view of Abui Haishim. Consequently, when Ibn Khaldtin i(lentifies the view of the Early MIuslims with that of Ash'ari, we may ask ourselves, with which of these two reported views of Ash'ari does he identify the view of the Early AMuslims? An answer to this question is furnished by Ibn Khalduin himself, when, commeiiting on the Mu'tazilite argument that the belief in real attributes is tantamount to a belief in many gods, he says: "This argu- 25 Ibid., 11. 8-9. 26 For this interpretation of the expression "what follows from them" see the distinction made in the Creed of al-Fa dali between sifdt al-ma' dniyy and sifdt mna'nawiyyah (cf.

A similar contrast is implied in Ibn Khaldun's statement later (p. 39, 11. 12-13) that al-Ash'ari "recognized four fifdt ma'nawiyyah [that is, living, knowing, willing, powerful] as well as audition (al-sam'), vision (al-basar), and speech (al-kaldm)".

But here another question must have arisen in the mind of Ibn Khalduin. Abui Hashim's formula that attributes are neither identical with the essence of God nor other than it was attacked by Abui Hashim's father, al-Jubba'l, and others,36 among them Ash'ari himself after his conversion to orthodoxy.37 It was found by all of them to be contrary to the Law of Excluded Middle, which re- quires that of two contradictories a subject must be either the one or the other. How, then, could Ibn Khaldfin approve of a view which Ash'ari himself, after having accepted it, rejected on the ground that it was in violation of a funda- mental law of thought? Ibn Khaldfin does not discuss this difficulty. But I am going to show that he anticipated it and provided an answer for it. Let us go back to his proof of the unity of God, or rather to his proof of the existence of God of which the proof of unity is a corollary. In that proof, after showing how we can arrive at a knowledge of the existence and unity of God from an observation of the sequence of causes and effects in the world, Ibn Khalduin dwells at great length on the scantiness and inadequacy of our knowledge of these causes. To begin with, though the causes in the created and finite world must have been taken by Ibn Khaldfin to be finite in number, still he says: "The intellect becomes confused in an attempt to perceive and enumerate them. Only a comprehensive knowledge can encompass them all."38 In making this statement, he must have had in inind the Koranic verse that God, and evidently God only, "counteth all things by number" (Surah 72 :98). Second, though Ibn Khald-in believed that all events in the world are directly created by God and that the causal nexus which appears to exist between them is only a matter of "custom," he still wonders whether in the succession of such events di- rectly created by God earlier events may not have, by the mysteriousness of God's action, some influence upon later events, and so he says that "What that influence really is and how it takes place is unknown."39 And since we are ignorant of the nature of the causes in the world, by which we arrive at the knowledge of the one Causer of causes, we are also ignorant of the nature of the Causer of causes. All we know about Him is the fact of His existence. He therefore con- cludes: "The intellect should not be used to weigh such matters as the oneness of God"40 and "the real character of divine attributes,'"4' for "it cannot comprehend God and His attributes."42 9 Muqaddimah, III, p. 38, 11. 16-17. 38 Shahrastani, Milal, p. 56, 11. 13 ff.

We are to believe in the unity of God; we are also to believe in the reality of attributes. These attributes, though real, are neither identical with God nor other than He. There appears to us to be a difficulty here, but there is really no difficulty. How this apparent difficulty can be solved is unknowable to us, for our intellect cannot comprehend the unity of God and His attributes. And why should we expect to comprehend God's unity in its relation to His attributes, he tries to tell us, when even the world of our ob- servation and experience, from which we derive our knowledge of the unity of God, is not fully comprehended by us. One must, therefore, accept such truths as given by revelation, without seeking to demonstrate them by reason. Let us now take up Ibn Khalduin's view on predestination. In his proof of the existence of God, which we have analyzed, within his open- ing statement that "the things that come into being in the world of existing things . . . require appropriate causes which are prior to them," after the words "in the world of existing things," he adds the explanatory statement: "whether they belong to bodies (al-dhawat)" or to either human or animal actions."45 The purpose of this additional statement is to enable him to use this proof of the existence of God from creation also as a proof of the power of God over all human actions. The argument by which he tries to prove the power of God is based upon Aristotle's explanation of the psychology of action, which in its essential features is as follows: Human action is caused by will (0ov'Xjo-ts), which consists of appe- tite (6pe?ts) and intelligence (vovs), or that special kind of intelligence described as thought (vo qTots) or reason (XoytoA6s) or practical thought (6tavota 7rpaK'rMc), which calculates the means to an end,46 and thought (r0 vQEZv) includes imagina- tion (caviraoLa).47 Animal action, however, is caused by desire (CErc6vgla), which, again, consists of appetite and intelligence, but that special kind of intelligence which is described as imagination.48 With this in the back of his mind, Ibn IKhaldu-n says with regard to "human and animal actions" that "among their causes there evidently belong intentions and desires, since no action can take place without desire (iradah) and inntetion (qasd)."49 The term qasd 'intention', I take it, is used by him here quite evidently 44 I take the term al-dhawdt 'essences', used here in contrast to human and animal "actions," to refer to what Ibn Khaldfun describes elsewhere as "dhawdt makdIah, such as the elements (al-'anair) ... and the three things that come into being from the elements, namely, minerals, plants, and animals" (ii, p. 365, 11. 14-16). The expression dhawdt makdah, I take it, is used by Ibn Khaldfin as the equivalent of the expression ajsdm mabsuitah, which, as a translation of Aristotle's &amp;7rXa acr/cara, "simple (i.e., unmixed and hence pure) bodies," is used in the sense of "elements." The substitution by Ibn Khaldfin of the term dhawdt 'essences', for ajsam 'bodies', is to be explained on the ground that both dhdt and jauhar are translations of the Greek ousia, and in Aristotle there is a statement, upon which the statement quoted from Ibn Khalduin is evidently based, which reads: "Ousia means the simple bodies, as, e.g., earth, fire, water, and the like, and in general bodies and the things composed of them, both animals and divine beings, and the parts of these" (Metaph., v, 8, 1017b, 10-13). 95 Muqaddimah, II, p. 27,11. 8-9. 46 De Anima, iII, 10, 433a, 9-25. 47 Ibid., in, 3, 427b, 27-28. 48 Ibid., iII, 10, 433a, 25-27. 49 Muqaddimah, iII, p. 27, 11. 17-18.</page><page sequence="7">Ibn Khaldun -on Attributes and Predestination 591 in the sense of rational human desire, as the equivalent of flobX?7ats in Aristotle, which is the equivalent of 7rpoalpects, ikhtiycdr 'choice', and the term irddah is used by him here, I take it, either in the narrow sense of irrational animal desire, as the equivalent of irtGOvgla in Aristotle, or in the general sense of both irrational and rational desire, as the equivalent of 6pe~ts in Aristotle.-0 Again, with Aristotle in the back of his mind, he says: "Intentions and desires are functions (umuir, literally: things) of the soul, originating ordinarily from previous consecutive representations (tasawwurdt)."51 The term tasawwur&amp;t, which I have translated here by "representations," is used by him here, as the term is generally used in Arabic philosophical literature, in the general sense of both representations of the imagination and representations of the intellect.2 Then, dropping the actions of animals and confining himself to human actions, he continues: "These representa- tions are the causes of the intention to act and the causes of these representations are other representations."53 As he goes on, he explains that of these representa- tions, which are the causes of human actions, some take place in the soul (nafs),54 whereas others belong to the intellect ('aqi).65 The term "soul," used here by Ibn Khaldiin in contrast to the term "intellect," corresponds to what in another place he describes as the first56 and second57 de- grees (mardtib) of the cogitative power (al-fikr) of the soul, as contrasted with its third degree.8 It also corresponds to what in still another place be describes as the first of the three kinds (asnaf) of human souls, as contrasted with the second kind.59 The first two degrees of the cogitative power are called by him respectively "the discriminating intellect" (al-'aql al-tamyiziyy)60 and "the empirical intellect" (al-'aql al-tajribiyy).,61 and the first kind of human soul corresponding to them is described by him as moving "downwards toward the perceptions of the senses and imagination."62 The third degree of the cogitative power is called by him "pure intellect" ('aql maha),63 and its corresponding second kind of human soul is described by him as that "which moves in the direction of spiritual intellection (ta'aqqul) and type of perception that does not need the organs of the body"64 and 50 On these two meanings of irddah, cf.

Finally, Ibn Khaldfin arrives at the conclusion that this series of representa- tions which cause human action in this created world of ours must culminate at a Causer or Creator. This conclusion is expressed by him in the following state- ment: "The representations are functions (ashya', literally "things") which God puts into the cogitative faculty of the soul (al-fikr) and of which one follows the other in succession."68 The term "causes" throughout this statement must, of course, be taken in accordance with his own previous explanation as meaning things that come into being in "the realm of custom." Having proved that God is the cause of all human actions, he presents in the course of his subsequent discussion, the various opinions held by Muslims as to God's power in relation to human action. He reproduces two views. First, he re- produces the view of the Mutazilites as denying "predestination" (al-qadar)69 and as considering "man as the creator of his own actions, the latter having nothing to do with the divine power."70 Second, he reproduces the view of the Early Muslims as maintaining that "God predetermines the action of each be- ing,"71 of which he himself approves in his warning to the reader not to think that it is "in your own power or in your own choice" to stop doing anything or to re- sume the doing of anything.72 This view of the Early Muslims is later identified by him with the view of Ash'ari, whom he describes as mediating between extreme views on all controversial problems, including the problems of attributes and predestination.73 But, while, with regard to attributes, he tells us, as we have seen,74 what the two extreme views were, with regard to predestination, he men- tions only one extreme view, that of the Mutazilites;75 but no mention is made by him of the other extreme. We know, however, that the other extreme view, f6 I take the expression al-fi'l ft ta'aqquliha to reflect the expression al-'aql bil-fi'l, vovs &amp;'Epycl, 'intellect in actuality,' rather than the expression al-'aql al-fa'al, vovs vloTlruc6s, 'active intellect.'

The power of acquisition is thus that modicum of freedom possessed by man in his action. But, inasmuch as according to Ibn Khaldfin that which immediately precedes human action is "intention," we have reason to assume that man's power of acquisition is connected with man's inten- tion. An allusion to this power of acquisition as a power created by God in man to act with a certain amount of freedom is to be found in his statement that "cogita- tion (al-Jtkr) is a special nature ((abi&gt;'ah) which God created exactly as He created all His other creatures," that it is "a power" (quwwah), and that "at times, it is the beginning of orderly and well-arranged human actions and, at other times, it is the beginning of the knowledge of something that had not been hitherto avail- able.''81 Now, it will be noticed, he does not say that each act of cogitation is directly created in man by God. He only says that God created in man "a special nature" or a "power" to cogitate, and that thereby man is led to planned or or- derly action or to the discovery of new knowledge by logical reasoning. Here, again, the orderly action and the new knowledge is not said to be directly created by God in man. There is in all this the implication that there is a certain element of freedom in man, that kind of freedom which he elsewhere ascribes to the medi- ating view of Ashtarli, the view which is known as that of "acquisition." Here again a question must have arisen in the mind of Ibn Khaldfin. The theory of acquisition has been criticized by Averroes as being "meaningless," on the ground that "if," as Ash'ari says, "the acquisition (al-iktisab) and that which is acquired are created by God, then man is inevitably compelled with regard to his 76 Baghdad!, Farq, pp. 327,11. 14-328, 1. 10; Shahrastani, Milal, p. 59,11. 15-18; cf.

As previously in dealing with the succession of causes so now in dealing with the succession of representations, though he has said that God puts each of these representations in the human soul, he still assumes that there is some connection between them, and so he asks himself, How are these successive presentations, which we are accustomed to think of as a causal series, connected with each other? To quote: "With regard to the representations which take place in the soul, their cause is unknown, since no one is able to know the beginnings of the functions (al-umfir, literally: the things) of the soul nor their ends."83 This protestation of our ignorance of the internal causes that lead man to action, we take it, is meant to be an answer to any difficulty that may be raised against any attempt to medi- ate between God's power and human freedom. What Ibn Khalduin wants to say by this protestation of human ignorance is this. It is true that God is the deter- mining cause of all human action, even his power of acquisition. It is also true that man cannot initiate action by himself. But man acts by a succession of what we are accustomed to call causes, namely, representations of the internal senses, which lead to intentions, which in turn lead to action. But we do not know how these internal causes, the representations of the internal senses, are causally re- lated to the external causes which precede them, nor do we know how they are re- lated to each other and how they are related to the intentions which follow them, nor again, do we know how actions are causally related to intentions. All we know is that God is their creator, but how He is their Creator we do not know. It is all a mystery, and within that mystery, Ibn Khalduin seems to suggest, there may be another mystery, one which allows a certain amount of inexplicable free ac- tion, so that somehow man is responsible for his actions, even though he has been predestined so to act; and somehow also God is just in holding man responsible for his actions, even though He himself has predestined man so to act. This tacit admission of a certain degree of human freedom, which in some inex- plicable manner is reconcilable with God's absolute power, is subtly indicated by him in still another way. The successive stages of events in the soul leading to ac- tion mentioned by him, as we have seen, are two: representations and intentions. But it will be noticed that, while he explicitly says that "intentions" originate from "previous consecutive representations"84 and while he also explicitly says that the consecutive representations are put by God into the cogitative faculty of the soul,85 he does not say that also the intentions are put by God into that faculty of the soul. The omission, I take it, is deliberate, and it is significant. The "intention" to Ibn Khalduln is an "acquisition," and acquisition is a "power," which, though created in man by God, is man's own power. The two somehow are 82 Kashf, p. 105,11. 20-21. 83 Muqaddimah, iII, p. 28, 11. 4-7. 84 Cf. above at n. 51. 85 Cf. above at n. 68.</page><page sequence="11">Ibn Khalduin on Attributes and Predestination 595 reconcilable, though how they are reconcilable we do not know, for we are ig- norant of the interconnection of events in the human mind. Such an ignorance of the interconnection of events, as we have seen, is main- tained by Ibn Khaldiin to exist also with regard to the external order of nature.86 Still, he takes care to point out, there is a difference between these two kinds of ignorance. With regard to the nature of the external world about us, he says: "As a rule, man is able to comprehend the causes that are external to us in nature and are apparent toK the eye and present themselves to our perception in an orderly and well-arranged manner, because nature is encompassed by the soul and on a lower level than it."87 A similar view is expressed by him in his statement that "knowl- edge of things that come into being, or opinion about them, can only result from knowledge of all their [four] causes, that is, the efficient cause, the material cause, the formal cause, and the final cause."88 All this reflects the view of GhazMli, who, while denying causality and making every event dependent directly upon God, to whom all things are possible, argues that this does not mean that we could not know beforehand that a youth left at home would not be changed into a dog or that a stone would be changed into god and similar changes considered impossible by experience, for, be says, that, though we believe that all these things are possi- ble, "God created in us a knowledge that He would not do these possible things."89 But ultimately this view is traceable to Philo, who, while admitting that God can upset the order of nature and create miracles, finds in the Hebrew scripture an assurance by God that the order of nature established by Him in the world will not be upset by Him unnecessarily.90 With regard, however, to the psychological causes within man, namely, the imaginational and intellectual representations, Ibn Khaldiin says that "inasmuch as the representations and the order in which they are arranged exceed the per- ceptive power of the soul, because they [partly] belong to the intellect ('aql), which is on a higher level than the soul, the soul can scarcely perceive very many of them, let alone all of them."'" Human action, therefore, is less predictable than action in the external order of nature. This conception of an inexplicable element of freedom despite his belief in the omnipotence of God runs throughout the course of his explanation of the develop- ment of human society, its beliefs and its institutions. Throughout his delinea- tion of the history of beliefs and institutions, he works on the assumption that civilization is the result of an interplay between the external world and human nature. Human nature is depicted by him as flexible and as subject to the influ- ence of external causes and as always being guided by reason. All this would seem to be contrary to Ibn Khaldiin's openly avowed belief that God predetermines all 86 Cf. above at nn. 88-89. 87 Muqaddimah, iII, p. 28, 11. 8-10. 88 Ibid., p. 228, 11. 2-4. 89 Ghazali, Tahafut al-FaldWifah, xvii, ?18, p. 285, 11. 9-10, and cf. ??11-12. 90 Cf.

Of this contradictory attitude Ibn Khaldfln himself every once in a while seems to become aware, and to assuage his theological conscience he quotes appropriate verses glorifying the power of God. Accordingly his exposition of the development of human beliefs and institutions as a natural process de- termined by external causes is rhythmically punctuated by such Koranic verses as "God decides, and no one can change His decision" (13:41),92 "God leads astray whomever He wants to lead astray, and He guides whomever He wants to guide" (16:95),93 "God gives kingdom to whomever He wants to give it" (2: 248) ;94 "When we want to destroy a city, we order those of its inhabitants who live in luxury to act wickedly therein, so that the sentence against them is justi- fied, and we do destroy it" (17:17).95 This, then, is the answer provided by Ibn Khaldun for the apparent conflict be- tween predestination and divine justice. As in the case of the oneness of God and His attributes, he declares that the conflict is only apparent. In reality, the two beliefs are reconcilable, even though we do not know how they are reconcilable, and they are reconcilable because in some inexplicable manner there is some free play in the internal, psychological causes of human action. The answer provided by Ibn Khaldfin for both these difficulties is not alto- gether new. It is only the adoption of an old answer given by Muslim theologians whenever they found themselves committed to two contradictory beliefs - an answer expressed by the Arabic words bi-ld kayfa, which, freely translated, means, "we know the contradiction can be reconciled, but ask us not how." The signifi- cance of the use of this bi-ld kayfa answer by Ibn Khaldfin is to be found in his own account of its history. According to Ibn Khaldfin, the bi-ld kayfa answer was commonly used by the Early Muslims96 as well as by the Ilanbalites,97 but fell into disuse with the appearance of Sunnite Mutakallimuin (al-mutakallimuin al- sunniyyah), the first of whom was Ash"arl,98 and more so with the appearance of "the method of recent theologians" (tariqah al-muta'khkhirin),99 the first ex- ponent of which was GhazAli.'00 With Ash'ari there began what Ibn Khaldiin describes as "intellectual evidence in defense of the articles of faith"'' and with Ghazali this intellectual evidence began to be couched in the "technical" (muslalah) terminology of the philosophers,'02 resulting in what Ibn Khaldin de- ploringly describes as a confusion of theology and philosophy.'03 Now, while these new types of theologians have found rational solutions for all the difficulties that 92 Ibid., i, p. 284, 11. 1-2; ii, p. 233, 11. 13-14; iII, p. 264, 1. 15. 93 Ibid., i, p. 364, 1. 5. 94 Ibid., p. 282, 11. 12-13. 95 Ibid., p. 261, 11. 12-14. 96 Ibid., iII, p. 37, 11. 2-7. 97 Ibid., p. 51, 11. 4-6. 98 Ibid., p. 52,11. 16-17; p. 53, 1. 10; p. 39,1. 9. 99 Ibid., p. 41, 1. 12. 100 Ibid., 1. 15. 101 Ibid., p. 39,11. 7-9. 102 Ibid., p. 41, 1. 11. 103 Ibid., 11. 17-19.</page><page sequence="13">Ibn Khaldfun on Attributes and Predestination 597 could be raised against the belief in attributes and in predestination, Ibn Khaldfin would have none of them. For him the old bi-ld kayfa was good enough. The ra- tional arguments of Ash'ari and Ghazili and their followers served a good purpose in refuting the arguments of heretics, when heresy was rampant in Islam. But Islam, thank Allah, has long since been purged of heresy, and so Ibn Khaldiin felt that for students of his own time there was no need of the rational kind of justification of religious doctrines. Faithful believers know that the doctrines of their religion are true, and whatever objections may be raised against them are not real objections; and so why bother to answer them. And in support of this attitude, Ibn Khalduin quotes a maxim by al-Junayd to the following effect: "The denial that there is anything wrong, when we know that it is impossible that there should be anything wrong, is itself wrong.'104 Or, perhaps, he was not so simple-minded as he appears. Perhaps in the age-old struggle between orthodoxy and rationalism in religion he saw nothing but a struggle between the suspension of reason and the perversion of reason and, like a goodly nomber of non-quibblers of every religion, he chose to suspend reason rather than to pervert it.
