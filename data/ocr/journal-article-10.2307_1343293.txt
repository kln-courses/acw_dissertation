<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technopoetics: Seeing What Literature Has to Do with the Machine Strother B. Purdy This title has a presumptuous sound; after all, is there not a considerable literature on the history of technology in the West and on its cultural effects widely considered? There is,l and I have no wish to add to it- in the ordinary way, that is. For I think that there is a surplus of information about technology as a physical structure (to borrow a linguistic metaphor, as a "surface" structure) but very little analysis of it as a mental structure (linguistically, a "deep" structure). We have a large accounting of what machines are and how they work and even how we think about them, but we have only a very small accounting of how we think them and to what extent such thinking appears in nontechnological things we do.2 This last could be called "how they think us," if it were not for the difficulty of distinguishing the meaning of such a phrase from the entirely different matter of artificial intelligence and its assumption that machine and human operation are or may be brought into coincidence. What I refer to is how our thought in inventing, designing, modifying, and using machines carries over into acts we do not consciously associate with them-like writing or reading poetry. An airplane in flight may be "pure poetry," or a Ferrari "a poem in steel"; it intrigues me to consider that beneath such object comparisons an object-of-thought connection may be made. Or in other words, there may be really something to a hackneyed compliment like "poem in steel." ("Ah, commendatore, tu sei veramente in gamba! Questa volta c'e la poesia di acciaio!") My preference for thought form over object form makes me less interested in machines that we can see than in those that we can't, and Critical Inquiry 11 (September 1984) ? 1984 by The University of Chicago. 0093-1896/84/1101-0003$01.00.

The first involves the history of technology: How is it that machines "disappear"-become less visible, impinge less and less upon popular consciousness? The effect cannot be imputed entirely to familiarity. The second involves the history of literature: If machines have disappeared, are there "disappeared"-or "invisible"-machines in literature? It is reasonably clear that we go to considerable lengths to hide the machines that surround us and that we choose, or our artists choose, insofar as such choice can be located, to restrict the appearance of machines in art.3 Commonly their restricted appearance in art is understood as a kind of resistance to some form of machine takeover, while their concealment has only uncommonly received analysis and is not generally discussed in context with the matter of artistic representation. But we do accept, at least in theory, the idea that style of living and style in literature are connected. If the machine penetrates our style of living, then-and this is the end of my inquiry-these invisibilities are of interest to literary criticism, for they have something to do with the way literature is written, with whether or not, that is, writers choose to describe machines, use them as characters, or give them any role at all to play in surface structure. Since the artist often works to reveal what his society works to conceal and since the postmodern period has so far been one of crisis in the relations between society and technology, we may expect to find in postmodern fiction, or in writing to come, some greater revelation, or simple exposure of the workings, than we could have seen before. A. Walton Litz was not being hyperbolic when he wrote that recent literary criticism exists "in a cultural vacuum, with little relevance to any of the major movements in American cultural life."4 One such movement, and to my mind clearly the major movement, is the mechanization of culture itself. First the machines altered the perceived-the landscape, with railroads and steel mills; the city, with suspension bridges and sky- scrapers; the workplace, with inhuman hands and arms-then they altered the means of perception, with the motion-picture camera and projector, television, telegraph, telephone, and word processor. While a torrent of books and articles has studied this phenomenon from a multiplicity of social and psychological angles, literary criticism has to date contented itself, for the most part, with sparse treatment. From that treatment we are led to draw the following rather lame conclusions: (1) Literature gives little evidence for a presumed importance of the machine in human affairs. Indeed, concern with machinery in literary Strother B. Purdy is the author of The Hole in the Fabric: Science, Contemporary Literature, and Henry James. His previous contributions to Critical Inquiry are "Stalingrad and My Lai: A Literary-Political Speculation" (Summer 1979) and "Reply to Lawrence W. Hyman" (Summer 1980). Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="3">132 Strother B. Purdy contexts is generally in inverse proportion to literary quality. The greatest writers of all time (Shakespeare, Homer, Goethe, Kalidasa ... ) are still those who lived and wrote before the machine age. (2) Machine effects are exterior to human relationships and do not (more than superficially) interpenetrate them. Therefore they may be treated as common factors in the literary equation and canceled out. John Updike's, Walker Percy's, or Ilya Ehrenburg's characters who drive automobiles illustrate no more about themselves by doing so than the characters of Leo Tolstoy, George Meredith, or Gustave Flaubert do in driving horses. There is no more need for a study of the automobile in fiction than there is for a study of the horse. And, somewhat in contradiction of (2), and to bolster the circularity of (1), there is (3) Machine involvement, as exterior to and supplantive of human re- lationships, is morally condemnable. Time spent with machines is time spent away from humans. This moral charge has a long history; since 1960 it has been involved in a good deal of reinterpretation of culture. Thomas Edison's laboratory cot, the witness to his famous catnaps, proudly displayed to Menlo Park visitors as a sign of his dedication-his subordination of the body and its needs to the brain and its wizardry of machine-generating invention- is now converted to evidence in psychobiography, something vaguely dishonorable, the index of an unhappy marriage, a wife left alone at night in the big showplace house. Under the pressure of this intermittent moral gaze, even major fictional roles reverse their signs or trade places: Marcel L'Herbier's great film L'Inhumaine (1924) presents the woman, the fickle prima donna who demands but never rewards male adoration, as inhuman. Her coldness drives Norsen, master of machines and sym- pathetic protagonist, to attempt suicide; yet when her life is in danger, he saves her-with his machines. So the future, in 1924, seemed one of salvation by technology. Viewed today, Norsen's rigid bearing, formal gestures, and incisive direction of the technicians in his great laboratory make him the inhuman one, the robotlike "machine man." Contrastingly, the wily temptress of the title, for all her theatrics and loftily mimed disdain, seems as warm and familiarly human as the mother of mankind. Most writers, other than writers of science fiction, seem to have agreed with the literary critics. The lives of modern fictional characters mimic the machine-filled lives of real twentieth-century people, but the machines "don't figure." Since machines belong neither in high art nor in our daily lives, they should be rejected. Or at least resisted, and it is sentimental gestures of resistance that we see most, in our lives and in Technopoetics</page><page sequence="4">September 1984 133 the lives of such literary characters. Saul Bellow's Charlie Citrine watches with distaste as a backhoe digs the new grave for the poet, his old pal Humboldt. My own grave-if I have one-will most probably be dug by a machine, and I don't plan now on doing anything about it. Yet I would have been horrified had my father's grave been dug that way, and I once spent an entire Sunday, with a lot of help from friends and relatives, digging a grave for a beloved-and very large-dog, killed by a passing car. We and dog too would have been somehow demeaned to have had a machine do that work for us: hand in paw, it might be said, we worked out the irrationality of that to our mutually imagined satisfaction. Citrine notices the backhoe, but his very attention to it contrasts emphatically with his unawareness of the thousand other machines that enable the action of Bellow's novel. This is characteristic of the general invisibility of machines in mainstream literature: they are there, part of the mimetic illusion of reality, but you don't normally see them. Even in science fiction this holds, more often than not. Once the author presents his imaginary machines (the sine qua non of the genre, which would more accurately be called "technology fiction")-the spaceship with ionic hy- perdrive, the blaster pistol, the personal translation beam-he gets on with the business of rescuing the lost princess or countering the latest threat from the Galactic Empire, and the machines fade into the back- ground. They are subjects of attention only to the extent that they differ from our own machines at home, the real machines. And even this crude effect isn't developed in the representation, because the characters of science fiction are usually as blind as we are. They are supposed to know no other machines but their own, and they know them as superficially as we know ours: as tools, rather than as facets of the mind. The introduction of a naif from another time or from the backwoods of the galaxy, who observes with awe and "sees strange," doesn't really alter the equation, no more than does any one of the many standard machine characters, talking computers, or robots. They are transparently humans in machine disguise, deriving from Tik-Tok of Oz, who is not that different from the Tin Woodman, who is not that different from Dorothy, and so on. The weak rationality of points (1)-(3) above is underlain by the strong irrationality of this proposition: we make machines invisible because we fear them. No more need, it would seem, for a symbol of death in the form of a scythe, the humble tool of the Reaper, when we can have a death object, an ultimate machine standing at the peak of a technological pyramid or at the end of gravity's rainbow, the ICBM with its hydrogen- bomb payload. In the face of such eschatological drama, issues take on a noble simplicity: it's them or us. All else seems mere quibbling, nibbling around the edges of the real and central proposition. The inquiry can't be so easily evaded, however, unless we are to settle for the condition of the child who fears the fire or the dog who fears the stick. Why should machines be feared? They multiply our powers; they are our creation Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="5">134 Strother B. Purdy and have no independent will; that they themselves could be a force of evil is a silly idea, mocked even by Karl Marx in Capital. Marx noted something else, though-their superiority: "The special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before the science, the gigantic physical forces, and the mass of labour that are embodied in the factory mechanism."5 They are now so important in our lives that we cannot live without them; we might disappear without them. To see them at work is to see our dependence and our inferiority to their strength, precision, and indefatigability. Once an un- spoken convention not to see them arises and remains in force for several generations, we may question whether we can see them. Such an interpretation accounts for the marginality, as well as eerie reverberation, of a book like Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which finds God in the gears of a motorcycle transmission, that compact locus of the transformation of power. And if God be there, where are we? That question has haunted Western man at least since Julien La Mettrie: Is man himself a machine? How does he tell himself from his machines-by the fact that he is weaker than they? Nor does Marx help here by pointing out that uniformity and division of labor in the factory transform the worker into an appendage of the machine. We don't like to see the machines around us, then, because they show us ourselves diminished. Another anthropomorphic convention has it that machines are our servants-or better, slaves-since we buy and sell them and pay them no wages. No man wishes to be a slave; any man who keeps slaves must be on guard lest they overthrow him. So there seems to be a rather strained parallel, once the anthropomorphism is taken up. Slaves are highly visible in an advanced culture, since their maintenance involves barbaric cruelty at odds with the culture's lofty view of itself. Today we are no longer slaveholders, or, if slavery still exists among us, it is invisible; you need a specially prepared perception to see it. Servants, on the other hand, still lead a formally recognized life among us, even though we recognize our humanity in them. They are numerically so scarce in the West as to be insignificant as a social factor (the invisible slaves, if they exist, are contrastingly numbered in the millions); so their level of visibility is of little interest. What is of interest, I think, is that while they were still extremely common, they were disappearing-just as the machines were to disappear subsequently without, however, any reduction in their numbers. Mark Girouard's Life in the English Country House traces this interesting social phenomenon. The medieval servingman slept in his master's bed- chamber or in its immediate vicinity. I have seen this in India, where a servant traveling with his master would sleep on the floor outside the bedroom door, an arrangement combining security (notably breached in our literature by the wiles of Lady Macbeth) with convenience (accessibility Technopoetics</page><page sequence="6">September 1984 135 to the master's call). Enter technology-along with other social factors such as the gradual replacement of male by female domestic servants- and they sleep apart, with communication by bells. Why not, since security in the home, for a period of roughly three hundred years, 1650-1950, was becoming a matter of less import? (Since 1950, bells among us in the United States are installed to summon more distant servants of a public nature-the police.) So far so good, but at a certain point-some- time in the eighteenth century, according to Girouard-this absence of servants, except when summoned, became an established desideratum. Servants were supposed to be invisible but efficient agents of the will of master or mistress, like Prospero's spirits of the air. The duke of Portland fired any serving maid unlucky enough to be seen by him in his house; the equally mad Ludwig II of Bavaria had constructed a dining room in which the table could be lowered between courses into a basement, there to be recharged, leaving the diners to a seclusion now considered regal, a privacy an earlier age considered suited to imprisonment. Outside Western Europe things were slower to change: in literature we have the unforgettable Oblomov of Ivan Goncharov and Tolstoy's Master and Man to remind us how different things were in Russia, and everywhere ordinary mortals had to endure the presence of servitors in the dining room. Indeed, some hosts liked to make a show of them, stationing one behind the chair of each guest; that practice lasted long enough for the astronauts to be put off by it in the Kennedy White House. But to be seen is not necessarily to be heard. According to an anecdote of Henry James, redolent of the heightened nineteenth-century taste for which we cherish him, he experienced grieved astonishment over La Viardot speaking to one of the table servants during a meal she presided over, her gaffe compounded by its occurrence in the presence of his great confrere Ivan Turgenev. Like James' own fictional butler, Brooksmith, who never spoke but heard and knew all, the ideal lives on. In the fictions of P. G. Wodehouse- which comprise a grand wish-dream of the life of the nineteenth-century English gentry, anachronistically set in the twentieth-the real center of interest is Jeeves, who "shimmers" in and out of rooms rather than pro- saically walking and who maintains his master's eternal bachelor idyll, despite the worst provocations of fortune, without even receiving in- structions. He appears a divinely ordered servomechanism, pursuing a plotted course through negative feedback. Elsewhere in modern art there are amusing remnants of this shift: I know my mother knew what was going on when Joan Crawford in Harriet Craig, playing the coldly efficient mistress of the household, berated the maid for using the front stairs, but my daughter must be puzzled. Less amusing are the twentieth-century megalomaniac fantasies that ex- aggerate the servant-master relation into an aspect of technology. Hitler and Albert Speer, the sorcerer's apprentice, conjured up an army of slave labor larger than that of the pyramid-building pharaohs, as if realizing Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="7">136 Strother B. Purdy the vision of the future in their countryman Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1925), wherein a huge laboring population is sealed below the pavements of the gleaming city ruled by the ultimate technocrat, the Master of Machines. In that film, the plot turns upon the Master's desire to rid himself of the slave army, since his technology has become sufficiently perfected to replace them. Here Lang and Thea von Harbou were taking inspiration from the United States: the skyscrapers of New York with their elevators, gleaming lights, and underground sources of power; and such factories as that of A. O. Smith in Milwaukee, built in 1916 to produce automobile frames essentially without the labor of men so that labor costs and labor troubles could be reduced to a vanishing point. In social history, bourgeois individualism seems to have combined with humanitarian sentiment: one could retain the newly cherished privacy and banish the reminders of past slavery by refusing to be personally served by others. This results in the irony of men hiding machines for humanitarian purposes. But we may doubt that servants could have faded from view and then disappeared altogether without the concomitant emergence of the machine, even though the fading started before la- borsaving devices entered the home. What seems to have been more important was thefantasy of the utterly discreet, silent, dependable servant that was stimulated by the emergence of the machine, as it had been earlier by the institution of slavery in its most bizarre and inhumane forms (silence ensured by amputated tongues; the harem secured by eunuchs). Few if any societies with the capacity to acquire machines or slaves have chosen to live with neither, though most have chosen to try to look as if they were. Clearly corroborative are the trade-offs to lower efficiency so frequently involved in the invisibility process. The servant banished to another part of the house is harder to find and communicate with and, feeling estranged-because no longer a "part of the family" in the sense of the physical proximity that alone gives the phrase meaning- works less efficiently. The automatic transmission makes the automobile's use of power invisible-but at the cost of higher gasoline consumption and lower performance. The "slimline" refrigerator masquerading as a kitchen cabinet successfully sheds the aggressive machine image of the old converted icebox with the coil on top-but at the cost of reduced accessibility, and thereby higher repair expenses, and reduced insulation and less efficient heat dissipation, and thereby higher operating expenses. By concealing water, heat, and electrical pipes, ducts, and conduits in the walls and ceilings, we turn the home or office into an invisible machine, an invisible machine in which a pressure leak is promoted to the status of catastrophe, electrical faults go unheeded until they produce a fire, and a fire once started is far more rapid and devastating, thanks to the fluelike effect of the enclosed hollow spaces. Converting the old gloomy and drafty basement, dominated by the monster furnace, into a tight, Technopoetics</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry September 1984 clean, family "recreation room," its tamed heating unit hidden behind an imitation-maple panel, has been a favorite postwar American domestic goal-and illusion. More often than not, its result has been damp, mold, a room no one feels comfortable in, and higher heating costs. For the drafts in the old basement guaranteed the health of the house and fed the furnace with free (not preheated) air. Arthur C. Clarke has suggested that the great computers running the society of the future may be placed under the sea, certainly close to an end point in the invisibility-cum- inaccessibility process. Technological disappearance, then, shows itself to be a sad tangle of matters human and mechanical, animate and inanimate. Common metaphor lies behind such interpenetration: an engine can be clutched, choked, and throttled; its camshaft, in French and Italian, is a "tree." In English as in French, a tall machine for lifting is a "crane," for it stands on one leg. Many machines have arms; lathes have heads and tails; cartridges and reloading dies have necks; clocks and watches and gauges have hands and faces. Invisibility itself may be a somatic analogue, for normal or healthy body state is close to unawareness. You learn you own a voltage regulator when it stops regulating the voltage to your car's battery; to be aware of the pressure of the blood in the vessels supplying the brain is to be in pain. Fright brings your own heartbeat to awareness, and awareness of your heartbeat is frightening-a dangerous positive- feedback loop. Somatic visions of paradise often tender a kind of bodi- lessness. To lie quietly with eyes closed in a warm swimming pool or on a sunlit beach is to be in a state bordering on sensory deprivation; the motion picture, the most popular entertainment of the modern world, is equally passively oriented. It places the spectator in a comfortable seat in quiet and darkness, converting him by illusion into a floating eye, a delightful state of having no body and thus incurring no bodily risk. Conferred with the privilege of being everywhere, the spectator can see all-murder, war, airplane crashes, shoot-outs at the O.K. Corral, dinner with Lucrezia Borgia, a date with Marilyn Monroe-and all without sustaining a scratch or undertaking an obligation. At least part of the time, we want to "not be," just as we want machines to "not be." Machine being and nonbeing go together pleasingly. Corresponding to the somatic analogue of machine-as-body is that of body-as-machine, mentioned above, here on the scale of whole societies. The American system of checks and balances is to the eighteenth-century steam engine as thought to object, the empirical "fix" of whatever threatens runaway destructive conditions being essential to both.6 The steam engine uses a flyball governor, a control system whose motive power is not external but identical to the power of the machine itself. Excess steam pressure, which will cause excess speed and ruin, must also accelerate the flyballs; this, in turn, causes centrifugal force to draw them outward, pulling on a linkage which opens a valve to release the excess pressure 137</page><page sequence="9">138 Strother B. Purdy and thereby slow the engine. Once the engine slows, the flyballs fall inward, closing their valve and conserving the remaining steam for the operation of the engine. A negative-feedback loop in human affairs may seem a gloomy prognostication of malfunction, but catastrophe wisely foreseen and planned for is catastrophe avoided. Rationalist rather than empirical, the political model preferred on the continent of Europe, where eighteenth-century deistic clockwork is the analogue, follows a linear design with no loops and absolute dependence upon the inclusiveness and accuracy of the first plan, compromise precluded by fixed principles. Once a deviation creeps in-running fast or running slow-it can only increase, and dictatorship, at least from the Anglo-Saxon point of view, seems a natural outcome. Language, as the common factor of humanity, could hardly escape the pressure of invisibility: it could be said that the test of having a language as one's native speech is the ability to speak it without being aware of it. The principle of economy of means alone substantiates the fact that for millions of people, in any case nearly all monolingual speakers, language is a "structureless" medium of existence from childhood on. A nation of poets could hardly communicate, for the poet, like the artist, as Henri Peyre said of Marcel Proust, "makes the invisible visible." Origins in language are poetic, outcomes prosaic; to hide the machine is to speak prose; the tendency of Western history is to produce M. Jourdain. Have the poem and the machine, then, some natural affinity? Mod- ernism may be credited with its discovery: William Carlos Williams called the poem a machine, after all. Even William Butler Yeats, to whom traces of Futurist provocation do not cling, celebrated the transformation of poet and poetry into machine form: Once out of nature I shall never take My bodily form from any natural thing, But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make Of hammered gold and gold enamelling To keep a drowsy Emperor awake; Or set upon a golden bough to sing To lords and ladies of Byzantium Of what is past, or passing, or to come.7 The automaton, the mechanical singing bird, is a fit embodiment of art and eternity for 1927; it had been two hundred years earlier an image of man. If the poem shows man not only the machine but himself as well, then there is a justification for my term technopoetics; and in tech- nopoetics there must be found both the mechanical effects of poetry and, ideally, the poetical effects of machines. On the assumption that in both machine and poem the complex and profound is a construct of the superficial and simple, it is proper to Technopoetics</page><page sequence="10">September 1984 139 begin with the latter. The elemental machine characteristic, and ground against which its variations are played, is repetition. And how deeply is repetition placed in human affairs! Freud saw it as the means to escape from time and as the recovery of lost identity; for Proust it was the past recaptured. For Henry Adams it was the whole modern world, for what made the flywheel of the great dynamo such a portent, rather than a grotesquely outsize toy, was its ability to spin with such accuracy, to repeat each cycle within a hairbreadth of its position on the preceding one. To Leo Bersani, "repetition provides the psychoanalytically oriented critic with his most important clue to the meaningful psychological structures in a writer's work."8 Yet repetition is also the nightmare of the sorcerer's apprentice-and Jacques Derrida's vision of writing gone out of control- something that divides the human from the inhuman. The piston that moves from left to right in the horizontal cylinder uses a crank to convert horizontal linear motion to reciprocal and circular motion. If we imagine it to be the piston of a single-cylinder 500 c.c. motorcycle like the Moto Guzzi Falcone, it both enables the motion of that shape and "enacts" a line of poetry, as printed for reading. Next, the eye, and the piston, return automatically to their starting point, which is at the same time generally "farther down the road" in some way: the motorcycle is no longer where it was before; the poem has moved one line closer to completion. By 1941, in a manual of poetry cited by Horace McNeil and Clarence Stratton, verse (etymologically from vertere, "to turn") was so defined: "Metrical verse, the rhythm of regularly repeated accents, is like the rhythm of most running machinery: the tick of a clock, the slap of a belt on a pulley, the puff of a locomotive, the click of car wheels on the rails."9 Of these motions, those most like the clock can inspire awe, and inattention, and remembrance of passing time; while those most like the steam engine, with variations of speed in response to internally produced stresses, seem more subtle and adaptive, and less coercive. Free verse, that notably modern liberation from metric, is the extension of this feedback principle into the pursuit of the illusion of machine invisibility. And here may be found the small but definitive shift from the use of repetition in Gertrude Stein to that in Samuel Beckett, or from that in Luis Bufiuel to that in Michael Snow, which separates modern from postmodern. Postmodern, when it is a name for artistic innovation and not simply for a period in history, means the capacity to return the machine to visibility and to face the repetition in its elemental nature. Raymond Queneau wrote of his Le Chiendent: "[It] may be compared to a man who, after having walked for a long time, finds himself back where he started from. [By the end of the novel] everything starts all over again, just as dismal and laughable as it was on the first page."?1 From such beginnings, I think, the real literary nature of our machine world may be discovered. For any sentence, in or out of poetry, has a Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="11">140 Strother B. Purdy machine equivalent, if we allow for the fact that the machine may be yet uninvented and the sentence unwritten. The fascination comes from working out whether both exist or, if only one, which one. 1. Nevertheless, the MLA's Interrelations of Literature, ed. Jean-Pierre Barricelli and Joseph Gibaldi (New York, 1982), has no place for "Literature and Technology" in its imposing outline for interdisciplinary scholarship in the humanities, which includes linguistics, philosophy, religion, myth, folklore, sociology, politics, law, science, psychology, music, visual arts, and film. "Science" is presumably meant to cover the ground, as is the custom, although it has only the most tenuous of connections to the critical technological aspects of engineering, design, production, merchandising, and consumption that create machines and bring them to bear on people. 2. Technological explanation, and, indirectly, celebration, has been a major component of European and American general encyclopedias at least since Denis Diderot, Encyclopedie; ou, Dictionnaire raisonne des sciences, des arts, et des metiers, 17 vols. (Paris, 1751-65). Modern specialized treatments are practically numberless, running from huge storehouses of in- formation like the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 15 vols. (New York, 1960), or A History of Technology, ed. Charles Singer, E. J. Holmyard, and A. R. Hall, 7 vols. (Oxford, 1954-78), to miracles of concision like the much imitated one-volume survey Wiefunktioniert das? Technische Vorginge, in Wort u. Bild erklirt (Mannheim, 1963). 3. I use "restrict" in a statistical sense, for since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution there have been artists to celebrate the machine; today's hyperrealist movement offers contemporary examples. These artists-Tom Blackwell, Ron Kleeman, Ralph Goings, and others-work a transformation like that of Andy Warhol with the pop object. They present not so much a celebration as an effort to turn looking into seeing, here directed at automobiles in particular, so much a part of everyday life as to have become (despite all efforts of the advertising industry) indistinguishable from one another and as a species from the other parts of the semiurban landscape-the mailbox, the front lawn, the visiting relatives staring into the camera. 4.
