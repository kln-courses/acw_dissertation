First Series, with a Biographical Introduction, by Dr. Shelton Mackenzie. Philadelphia: G. G. Evans. 1859. 16mo. pp. 414. Mr. Brown is a young Baptist clergyman of Liverpool. Educated at first as a surveyor and engineer, he became familiarly acquainted with the less cultivated classes, while, by faithful study and self-disci pline, he has since qualified himself to become their teacher. Six years ago he commenced a series of Sunday-afternoon lectures at Concert Hall, Liverpool. His audience usually consists of from two to three thousand working persons. Shunning the formalism of a text and a set sermon, which might repel many of his hearers, he announces for his subject the last theme of popular interest, or some familiar proverb capable of being spiritualized, or some false maxim which is stealing the hearts of the people. Thus among the titles in the volume now before us we find such as these : " There's a Good Time Coming " ; " Penny Wise and Pound Foolish " ; " There 's nae Luck about the House" ; " Waste Not, Want Not " ; and "Tell the Truth, and Shame the Devil." Many of these lectures have been printed and circulated separately ; and of one of them, on drunkenness, under the title of " Five Shillings and Costs," no less than forty-five thousand copies have been sold. It is small praise to say that these Lectures are free from the coarseness and irreverence that deface Spurgeon's sermons. They belong to another and an immeasurably higher intellectual plane. Anthropomorphic representations of the Deity and sensuous imagery constitute what is least exceptionable in the glittering rhetoric of the great London preacher ; Mr. Brown is made fervent and eloquent by profoundly solemn conceptions of the objects of religious faith, by a piety in which reverence is blended with love, and by an earnest and self-devoting philanthropy. There is in his style of discourse no letting down of himself or his office, but the sedulous aim to throw around common and lowly interests, duties, and pleasures cords of attachment to the spiritual world, and thus to get upon his neglected and unnur tured fellow-citizens a purchase by which they may be drawn out of degradation and evil. We trust that this is but the first of a series of volumes at least equal in number to those which we have from Spur geon ; and there are several of the single discourses which we would strongly commend to our own Tract Societies or Boards of Publication, as admirably adapted to the needs of their beneficiaries, especially to the condition of the masses of the people in our great cities.</page></plain_text>
