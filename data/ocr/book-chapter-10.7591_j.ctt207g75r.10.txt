<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 6Embodying Culture: Dorian’s Wish I have argued th roughou t this book  that, in scenes o f  sympathy,  identity  takes shape as social identity: that w hen  subjects confront each  other across a social divide, the elements that define this boundary  consti- tute— at least for a m om ent— their subjectivity M y discussions o f  Daniel  Deronda and The Picture o f Dorian Gray are concerned  less w ith  the at- tempts to  sympathize across class lines that characterized earlier texts than  w ith  the way, in  these la te-century  novels, expressions o f  personal affinity  and desire also function  as assertions o f  cultural identity. Because late-  n ine teen th -cen tu ry  ideologies define identity  increasingly in group  term s— as, for instance, m em bership in a nation or in a sexual category—   sympathy becom es m ore explicitly a m atter o f  claim ing identity w ith, or  distance from, such group identifications. Indeed, in  these la te-n ine-  teen th -cen tu ry  texts expressions o f  individual identity  (identity that m ight  be defined as difference from  others) becom e increasingly difficult to  differentiate from  expressions o f  cultural identity  (identity defined as  m em bership in  a group). Thus the self Daniel D eronda develops during  the course o f  E liot s novel coincides neatly w ith  his discovery o f  his Jewish  background, w hile D orian  Gray s desires construct an avowedly symbolic  identity, one that— for n ine teen th - and tw entieth-cen tury  readers— em - bodies bo th  la te-n ine teen th -cen tu ry  aestheticism and m odern  male h o - mosexuality. A t stake in these readings is the way the scene o f  sympathy 158 </page> <page sequence="2"> Embodying Culture 159 is also— and always— a scene o f  cultural identification, in w hich  the spec- ta to r’s identity  is inseparable from  an im agining o f  the o th e r’s place; at  stake as well is the way in  w hich, w h en  individual and cultural identity   collapse into one another, the o ther w ith  w h o m  one sympathizes may  tu rn  ou t to be— as is the case, dramatically, in Dorian Gray— o n e’s self. A  character w ho  enacts the scene o f  sympathy w ith in  him self—indeed, o f   w h o m  it m ight be said that he sympathizes only w ith  him self—D orian   Gray bo th  reinforces and extends the implications o f  the scene o f  sympa- thy as I have described it so far. Dorian Gray's scene o f  sympathy inheres in the contrast betw een the  hero ’s idealized body and his fantasy o f  that same body’s degradation, and  in the way the novel positions these as alternative images o f  cultural pos- sibility. T he contrast betw een the beautiful D orian  and his hideous picture  recapitulates the scene o f  sympathy w ith  w hich  this book  began: D orian ’s  picture is a fantasy in w hich  m oral decline rationalizes econom ic anxiety,  m arking a safe distance betw een the subject w ho m ight fall and the one  w ho  already has. In this case, the identity-defin ing o ther— w ho is, o f   course, D orian  h im self—is manifestly bo th  cultural fantasy and self- projection, a sim ultaneous internalization and anatom y o f  the scene  V ictorian fiction and V ictorian culture located on the streets. T he constellation o f  em otions D o rian ’s scene evokes— the tension be- tw een fascination, repulsion, and attraction, for instance, in  his relation to  the picture— recalls other, earlier versions o f  the scene o f  sympathy and  the recurrent questions that surround it. W ith  w hom , for example (or as  w hom ) is the sympathetic spectator identified? W hat are the implications  o f  self-picturing— the replacem ent o f  the self w ith  a picture? W hy  is  identity figured as an econom ic configuration, an exchange betw een im - ages o f  degradation and ideality? Foregrounding these questions, the nov- els also revises them . A ttributing  m oral significance to the blots and marks  the picture accumulates, Dorian Gray makes o f  a paradigm atic aesthetic  difference— the difference betw een beauty and ugliness— a paradigmatic  cultural drama that, I w ish to argue, finds its echo in  contem porary  for- m ulations o f  cultural and political identity. T he  difference betw een  D o rian ’s original w ish and his m em ory  o f  it, for instance— the difference  betw een the impulsive expression o f  a desire no t to age and a m oral nar- rative about sin and retribution— encapsulates the transform ation o f  ex- </page> <page sequence="3"> i 6 o  The Aesthetics o f Cultural Identity perience into narrative that, as we have just seen in Daniel Deronda, char- acterizes the fo rm ation  o f  cultural narratives. T h e  dram a W ilde’s novel  makes ou t o f  the difference betw een beauty and ugliness— for example,  the danger o f  discovery, the obsessive checking and rechecking o f  the p ic- ture, and the adventures in “low  life” w hose m eaning D orian  confirms on  the surface o f  the portrait as soon as he lives them — suggests the form a- tion  o f  cultural identity  as a m oralization or rationalization o f  aesthetic  choices w hose m eaning m ight be revealed in, or m ight just as well be h id- den by, the face one chooses. Dorian Gray's scene o f  sympathy suggestively  figures, in several ways and w ith  relevance to several different discourses,  the aesthetic dim ension o f  m odern  and contem porary  identities.1 N eith er person nor, exactly, character, D orian  is, the novel tells us, a  type: the “visible sym bol” o f  the age.2 And, it has followed, the novel’s crit- ics have taken D orian— and W ilde him self—to be preem inent figures for  and préfigurations o f  aesthetic culture and m o d ern  male hom osexual  identity. B u t w hat happens at the in tersection o f  character and cultural  em bodim ent: w hat does it mean, as W alter B enn M ichaels asks, to im ag- ine a culture “in the form  o f  a person”?3 Toward the end o f  the n ine teen th  century, historians and theorists o f   sexuality agree, the shaping activities o f  m edicine and the law codified a  variety o f  activities and m odes o f  being into an identity.4 In the form ula- 1 M y sense o f  the way experience becomes cultural narrative, as argued here, is indebted  to Walter Benn Michaels’s account o f  cultural identities in Our America: Nativism,  Modernism, and Pluralism (Durham: Duke University Press, 1995).

In the final week o f April 1895 Oscar Wilde stood in the prisoner’s dock  o f the O ld Bailey, charged, in the dry words o f  the indictment, w ith “acts  o f gross indecency w ith another male person.” ...  The prosecutor for the  Crown explained to the ju ry  in more vivid terms what this meant: Wilde  and his co-defendant had jo ined  in an “abominable traffic” in w hich  young men were induced to engage in “giving their bodies, or selling them, to other men__ ” Wilde answered these charges, as is well known, in a speech o f sudden and impassioned energy. Passionately defending  male love as the noblest o f attachments, a love “such as Plato made the  very basis o f his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets o f  Michelangelo and Shakespeare,” Wilde called it “pure” and “perfect” and  “intellectual” . . .  his superb self-possession and ringing peroration so  electrifying that the courtroom  listeners burst into spontaneous ap- plause. . . .  The applause o f W ilde’s listeners marks the sudden emergence  into the public sphere o f a m odern discourse o f male love formulated in  the late Victorian period by such writers as Walter Pater and John  Addington Symonds and Wilde himself, a new language o f  moral legit- imacy pointing forward to Anglo-American decriminalization and, ulti- mately, a fully developed assertion o f homosexual rights.5 Thus, although Basil’s painting is entirely exterior to the text, it provides  the reference point for a mode of representation that admits the visible,  erotic presence of the male body.6 W hen Basil Hallward confesses his love for Dorian Gray, those who dwell  under contemporary signs o f Hellenism cannot help but hear the open- ing notes o f  their own song: “A while ago I went to a party . . .  after I had  been in the room about ten m inutes. . .

M om ents at w hich homosexuality is said, w ith  some  suddenness, to becom e visible, they manifestly dem onstrate the im aginary  status o f  cultural identity: they are opportunities for identification, places  w here the self may imaginatively be located. These are no t just m om ents  in the history o f  a cultural identity, that is, bu t m irror scenes for the consti- tu tion  o f  one, delineating for reader, spectator, consumer, and critic w hat I  wish to call the im aginary body o f  culture. For rather than announcing that  a particular identity has currency, visibility bestows that currency; and w hat  “currency” means, in  this sense, is availability for identification (“His at- traction to D orian  Gray appears as nothing other than the first act o f  the  now  well developed drama o f  self-realization we call com ing o u t”).8  Registering  the transform ation o f  an image o f  degradation into one o f  ide- ality, o f  the degraded object o f  sympathy into a figure in w hose place any- one— theoretically, everyone— may see themselves, these images exchange  a scene o f  sympathy for one o f  identification, replacing one kind o f  sym- pathy (revulsion as secret sympathy; sympathy w ith  society’s “victim ”) w ith   another (sympathy as identification and desire, so that the o ther’s place be- comes one a reader m ight wish to occupy). For to enter into visibility is to  give up some degree o f  cultural difference at the very m om ent one claims  it, to becom e part o f  the com m on realm in w hich cultures (or, m ore pre- cisely, images o f  cultural identity) circulate. As theorists o f  the visible from  Jean Baudrillard to Kaja Silverman have pointed  out, rather than register- ing the em ergence into public light o f  som ething already in existence, vis- ibility is that som ething, signaling the inseparability o f  identity from its rep- resentations.

Invoking B enedict  A nderson’s idea o f  im agined com m unities, for instance, Sollors describes  the way, as aristocratic pow er declined in  the eighteenth century, “ the im - m ediate connectedness o f  the aristocracy was replaced by a m ediated form   o f  cohesion that depended, am ong o ther things, on  literacy and ‘national’  (and ethnic) literatures.” Literature and the circulation o f  p rin ted  texts in  general, A nderson argues, assist in the form ation o f  com m unities circum - scribed less by b irth  or te rrito ria l boundaries than by their m em bers’  shared know ledge.10 A nd im agined com m unities, o f  course, require im agined identities—   identities n o t lim ited (as the com m unities are not) to  categories o f  na- tionality or ethnicity. D ow ling’s history o f  the O xford M ovem ent, for in - stance, w h ich  traces the hom osocial codings o f  the O xford  Hellenistic  tradition, bo th  reveals the em bedding o f  one culture in another and de- tails the m aking o f  a new  culture, a new  group identity, ou t o f  an already  existing tradition. W hat D ow ling traces is, precisely, “the role o f  V ictorian  Hellenism  in  legitim ating hom osexuality as an identity.” 11 Yet still requir- ing explanation is the relationship betw een the previously uncodified in - dividual and the now  codified group, since the form ation o f  a new  iden- tity is the form ation o f  new  identities, and the invention o f  hom osexuality  the invention o f  persons deem ed homosexuals. If  such form ations require  new  identities, that is, they also require the inculcation o f  desire for those  identities— and, as a corollary, the inculcation o f  desire for identity itself.12 identification one might hear— and Dowling certainly hears— in the applause for W ilde s  courtroom peroration. 10 Werner Sollors, The Invention of Ethnicity (N ew  York: Oxford University Press, 1989),  xxi.; Franco Moretti, The Way of the World: The Bildungsroman in European Culture (London:  Verso, 1987); Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities : Reflections on the Origin and Spread  of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1983). 11 Dowling, Hellenism and Homosexuality, 31. 12 Foucaults work has, o f  course, explored in detail the means by which subjectivity is  produced through techniques such as confession and self-examination.

In the case o f  The Picture o f Dorian Gray; the goal has  been to re tu rn  the novel to its specific historical and sexual context, read- ing against w hat Eve Sedgwick calls the “alibi o f  abstraction” : the abstract  moralism, the evacuated sexuality, o f  its standard in terpretations.13 Yet the  abstractions on w hich  W ilde’s novel relies, the em pty term s o f  its codings,  and perhaps above all its definitive binarism  (beauty /  ugliness) are u n - avoidable; it is, after all, the affiliation betw een the aristocratic male body  and the abstraction “beauty” that allows for the tex t’s general currency.  R egarded as one o f  m odern  hom osexual identity’s m ost im portant icons,  D orian  Gray is also a paradigmatic image o f  masculine beauty and desir- ability. In re turn ing  some degree o f  abstraction to the novel’s in terpreta- tion, therefore— or at least re tu rn ing  to  the abstractions on  w hich  the  novel relies— I wish to locate desire for D orian , and D o rian ’s desire, w ith in   a m ore inclusive eroticization o f  identity: one in w hich  D o rian ’s w ish to  change places w ith  his p icture reveals identity  itself, here allegorized as  culture’s visible form , to be one o f  the m odern  subject’s m ost sought-after  objects o f  desire. Thus the la te-n ine teen th-cen tury  ideology that, follow- ing Foucault’s logic, is said to have redefined self in term s o f  sexuality— in  w hich “w ho  I am ” becom es “w hat I w an t”— is here reim agined w ith  o n - tology as desire’s subject, so that w hat is w anted is, precisely, “w ho I am ” :  identity itself. D o rian ’s identity  inheres in— is m ade o f—the contrast and active in ter- change betw een the novel’s constructions o f  beauty and ugliness, and in - terpretations tend  to rest on  the meanings attributed to  each.14 Yet it has 13 Sedgwick, Epistemology of the Closet, 164. 14 To raise the issue o f  the novel’s aesthetic context is also to raise that o f  its relation to  the aesthetic movement. What is important about the movement, for the purposes o f  this  reading, is its exposure o f  the role played by aesthetics in Victorian structures o f  identity,  for rather than making identity into an aesthetic issue, the aesthetic movement revealed  that it already was one. W ilde’s novel has always presented a signal critical problem: how   can it be the case that such a resolutely antimoralistic novel is so relentlessly moralistic?  Dorian s fate seems to confirm Victorian morality’s counter-aesthetic position: beauty, it  insists, is definable only in moral terms. And yet in playing out such a paradigmatically </page> <page sequence="8"> Embodying Culture 165 never been no ted  that the m oral w eight the picture com es to bear during  the course o f  the novel— the m eaning D orian  him self comes to attribute  to  it— is far rem oved from  the initial w him sy that brings it in to  being.  Here, from the m iddle o f  the novel, is D o rian ’s recollection o f  his wish:  “H e had uttered  a m ad wish that he him self m ight rem ain young, and the  face on  the canvas bear the burden o f  his passions and sins; that the painted  image m ight be seared w ith  the lines o f  suffering and th o u g h t” (119). B ut  w hat he actually says (at the novel’s beginning) is this: “ If  it were I w ho  was always to be young, and the p icture that was to grow  old!” (49).  D o rian ’s wish for an exchange is itself exchanged, his original, impulsive  desire for youth  and his aversion to aging replaced by a m orally charged  scenario in w hich  the picture becom es the bearer o f  “passions and sins.”  A nd this exchange, or false m em ory, is actually true to  the novel’s eco- nom ics o f  degradation, since, as the picture alters, w hat matters is no t the  type o f  action com m itted— not the k ind o f  “degradation”— but rather (as  if  such m atters w ere codifiable, and self-evidently so) the am ount. T he   picture pictures accum ulation, displaying n o t the detail o f  experience bu t  the fact o f  it (we can’t know, from  looking  at it, w hat experience it  records— as the history o f  the novel’s reception, and the continuing need  to decode the picture, suggests). For D orian , sin, old age, suffering, and even “ th o u g h t” are rendered  equivalent in a generalized picture o f  degradation that looks like this: “T he  cheeks w ould becom e hollow  or flaccid, yellow crows’ feet w ould creep  round  the fading eyes and make them  horrible. T he  hair w ould  lose its  brightness, the m ou th  w ould gape or droop, w ould  be foolish or gross, as  the m ouths o f  old m en are. T here w ould  be the w rink led  throat, b lue-  veined hands, the tw isted body, that he rem em bered in the grandfather  w ho  had been  so stern to h im  in  his b o yhood” (153). O r  maybe this:  “Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, w ith  a knife in his  heart. H e was w ithered, w rinkled, and loathsom e o f  visage. It was no t until  they exam ined the rings that they recognized w ho it was” (264). Victorian identity drama, the novel suggests the extent to which identity was, for the  Victorians, an aesthetic category For in insisting on the collapse between Dorian and his  picture at its end— the novel’s most quintessentially Victorian gesture—‘W ilde suggests  that Dorian’s tragedy is largely a tragedy o f  beauty: one that inheres in the disparity be- tween exterior and interior values. The aesthetic movement, then, rather than being  Victorian morality’s opposite, develops that morality’s implicit aesthetic. </page> <page sequence="9"> 166 The Aesthetics o f Cultural Identity T he speculations o f  the first passage (“ the m o u th  w ould  gape and  d roop”) are, for all intents and purposes, fulfilled by the second. And, in  tru th , as the picture reduces all degradation to a com m on currency, that o f   ugliness, it exposes the surprising presum ption, given the subtleties o f  taste  D orian  comes to embody, that w hen  it comes to ugliness there is no ques- tion  o f  taste (at least for W ilde’s readers— in this sense bo th  the picture  and the book  express a w idely shared fantasy about ugliness). Age and sin,  the novel’s language suggests in its circulation o f  ugliness term s—   “hideous,” “horrib le,” “w rink led”— are interchangeable n o t only w ith   each other bu t also w ith  o ther forms o f  the “loathsome,” such as the figure  o f  the “ho rrid  old Jew ” w ho owns the theater in w hich  Sibyl Vane per- forms, or the grandfather o f  w h o m  D orian  has “hateful m em ories.” D o rian ’s beauty similarly lacks specificity; like his ugliness, w h ich  at- taches itself indistinguishably to the figures “old” and “Jew,” it bo th  evokes  and denies specific affiliations. For despite the possibility o f  nam ing those  affiliations— Sedgwick, for instance, contrasts W ilde’s middle-class Irish-  ness w ith  D o rian ’s aristocratic Englishness, w hile for D ow ling D o rian ’s  beauty has a H ellenic textual history— w ith in  its im m ediate social and  cultural context, the novel’s ideal o f  beauty (“gold hair, blue eyes, rose-red  lips”) constitutes an evacuation o f  meaning: it is m eant to signify no th ing   o ther than beauty itself.15 Thus binding together its ideal o f  beauty w ith   its exchangeable images o f  degradation, the novel forecloses its ow n cele- bration o f  insincerity as a m ultiplication o f  personalities into a stark divi- sion and accountability: the difference betw een beauty and ugliness. D orian ’s relation to his picture has, o f  course, been theorized in  many  ways, no t the least powerful o f  w hich  rely on the m oral term s the novel  itself provides. F iguring D o rian ’s identity  in an econom y o f  appearances,  however— as the difference and exchange betw een beauty and ugliness—   the novel allows for another k ind o f  interpretation, one that has m ore to  do w ith  its role in a history o f  cultural identities than w ith  the history o f   its literary interpretations. For the difference betw een beauty and ugliness  per se participates in the underlying binarism  o f  certain m odern  cultural  narratives o f  identity, narratives that depend less on  specific details o f  iden- tity than on  the positive or negative valuation o f  identities: the positing o f 15 Eve Sedgwick, Tendencies (Durham: Duke University Press, 1993), 151; Dowling,  Hellenism and Homosexuality; 150. </page> <page sequence="10"> Embodying Culture 1 6 j desire or its absence. Such narratives, that is, resolve w hat m ight be a m ul- tiplicity o f  identities in to  a choice betw een  identities, in the form  o f  a  difference betw een self and other. A nd this difference, I w ish to argue, in  tu rn  reflects the condition  o f  belonging o r no t belonging to a group.  Em bodying the imaginative possibilities o f  the scene o f  sympathy as I have  described it, îo r instance, the contrast betw een  beautiful and ugly images  of D o rian  Gray reproduces the  aesthetics of contem porary identity poli- tics, in w hich  identity  takes shape as the difference betw een negative and  positive cultural projections. Identity  politics attempts to bestow  value on  identities the dom inant culture devalues: it attempts to transform  ugliness  (a particular identity  as perceived by the dom inant culture) in to  beauty  (that same identity, as projected in response by the group so nam ed), and  its m echanism  is the transformative pow er o f  the idea— and im age— o f  the group. In the “ iden tity” o f  identity  politics, the individual and the  group function as reflexes and projections o f  each other— m utually con- stitutive images— w ith  the group functioning as the engine o f  the desire  for identity, the body ou t o f  w hich  individual bodies are made. Indeed, it  is because o f  the similarity betw een the ideologically constructed iden ti- ties o f  the late n ineteen th  century, the image m aking o f  identity  politics,  and Dorian Grays figuration o f  identity  as an interplay betw een valued and  devalued images o f  the self that, in W ilde’s novel, “we may catch the early  strains o f  an identity politics w hose anthem  will eventually becom e loud  enough to make itself heard even on Saint Patrick’s Day.” 16 Even as the  novel refers to a specific politics, however, the aesthetic fo rm  by means o f   w hich  that politics is represented— its reliance on  an idealized image o f   masculine identity— makes the character D orian  Gray w idely available for  identification: for, at the very least, “literary” sympathy. M y argum ent thus situates Dorian Gray in  the contex t o f  la te-n ine-  teen th -cen tu ry  ideologies that may be viewed as precursors o f  a m odern   symbolic politics o f  identity: ideologies in w hich  the individual is w ith  in - 16 Nunokawa,“Homosexual Desire,” 313. Dowling recognizes, implicitly, the role o f  the  group in the transforming o f  homosexuality’s image: “Such writers as Symonds and Pater  and W ilde. . .  find the opening in which ‘homosexuality’ might begin to be understood as  itself a mode o f  self-development and diversity, no longer a sin or crime or disastrous civic  debility but a social identity functioning within a fund o f  shared human potentialities, now   recognized as shared” (Hellenism and Homosexuality, 31). </page> <page sequence="11"> 168 The Aesthetics o f Cultural Identity creasing frequency im agined as a m em ber o f  a group. R elevant here is the  Foucauldian account o f  a shift from  action to essence in the form ulation  o f  n ineteen th -cen tu ry  identities. B ut m ore useful is the m odel o f  nation- alism, w hich  serves as a general m odel o f  identity  from  the n ine teen th   century  onward, and w hich  accounts for b o th  the affective passion and the  dom inant trope o f  male bonding  in Daniel Deronda and Dorian Gray. For  nationalist ideology positions identity  as the culm ination o f  a narrative o f   desire and an effect o f  group m em bership; in it, desire for group m em - bership is indistinguishable from  desire for identity per se (thus the rele- vance, once more, o f  Julia Kristeva’s description o f  nationalism  as a condi- tion  in  w hich  “ to b e ” is “to belong”). In this context, D o rian ’s w ish to  change places w ith  his ow n idealized image may be understood no t only  as a desire to  be an object o f  desire, or as a desire for a particular identity,  bu t m ore fundam entally as a desire for identity itself.

T he  conversion o f  loss into gain  the novel effects— the way the enduring  im age o f  the beautiful D orian   emerges (if one agrees that it does) from  an ostensible narrative o f  de- cline— resembles w hat m ight be called the conversion narrative o f  iden- tity politics: D orian  dies into representation, his beauty, prefiguring w hat  D ow ling refers to as the current w ide acceptance o f  hom osexuality by the  dom inant culture, functioning as a kind o f  projection into the future: an  invitation to the transform ation o f  the image o f  hom osexuality itself.18  T he  novel’s erotics, I thus wish to  suggest, is finally a cultural one, and its  language o f  sexual desire supports a narrative o f  cultural desire, a desire for  cultural em bodim ent (the same desire, expressed as bo th  an attraction to - ward and revulsion against an “object” o f  sympathy, that, I have suggested,  shapes earlier scenes o f  sympathy).

To no good  end, cultures are im agined to possess identity, argues Michaels, and inher- ent value is (therefore) attributed to their survival. B ut how  is it that a set o f  practices (his definition o f  culture) comes to  be identified w ith  personhood? H ow  do habits acquire the nim bus o f   identity; w hy is the sum  m ore than its parts? (Or, how  is it that “m odern   hom osexual iden tity” comes to acquire a “face,” and w hat does it m ean  that it does?) O n e  answer, as I have suggested, m ight lie in  Foucault’s dis- cussion o f  the way la te-n ine teen th -cen tu ry  medical and ju rid ical dis- courses transform ed practice into identity, m aking “possible the form ation  o f  a ‘reverse’ discourse: hom osexuality began to speak in its ow n behalf, to  dem and that its legitim acy or ‘naturality’ be acknowledged, often in the  same vocabulary, using the same categories by w hich  it was medically  disqualified.”21 W hile this form ulation begs the question, since rather than  explaining personification, it personifies— “hom osexuality began to speak  in its ow n behalf”— it nevertheless suggests that desirable images o f  cul- 19 It is, o f  course, important that the paradigmatic representation o f  this desire is figured  as the difference between beautiful and ugly male bodies. As Sedgwick writes, almost  everything in the late nineteenth century takes this form: “In the development toward eu- genic thought around and after the turn o f  the century, reifications such as ‘the strong,’ ‘the  weak,’ ‘the nation,’ ‘civilization,’ particular classes, ‘the race,’ and even ‘life’ itself have as- sumed the vitalized anthropomorphic outlines o f  the individual male body and object o f   medical expertise” (Epistemology of the Closet, 178). I want to emphasize both the cultural  specificity o f  Dorian Gray’s images and what might be called the novel’s will to abstract- ness: the way the opposition between beauty and ugliness encapsulates the binary con- struction o f  identity in identity politics, 20 Michaels, Our America, 180. 21 Foucault, History of Sexuality, 101. </page> <page sequence="13"> 170 The Aesthetics o f Cultural Identity tural identity em erge in response to, and are inseparable from, w hat Jud ith   B utler calls the “injurious te rm ” that gives a particular identity  its nam e—   the te rm  that, in the Althusserian scenario o f  interpellation, calls it into  being.22 A nd it suggests, too, via the rhetoric o f  personification, the role  group identity plays in  this identity-form ing narrative: that it is possible to  speak on o n e’s behalf only w hen  identity is defined in collective term s, as  som ething shared w ith  others. If  we pursue the im plications o f  Foucault’s narrative, in w hich   conflicting images o f  identity exist in necessary relation to one another,  then  W ilde’s p ic ture-painting scene— the scene in w hich  D orian  recog- nizes him self “as if  for the first tim e”— begins to resemble a positive alter- native to the Althusserian scenario in w hich  the subject is hailed as a sub- je c t o f  the law. Indeed, the scene provides a response, in the form  o f  a  counternarrative, to the question B utler poses about A lthusser’s scenario:  “W hy should I tu rn  around?”23 The lad started, as if  awakened from some dream. “Is it really finished?”  H e murmured, stepping down from the platform. “Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly today. I am awfully obliged to you.” “That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry.“Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?”  Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front o f his picture, and  turned towards it. W hen he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed  for a m om ent w ith pleasure. A look o fj oy came into his eyes, as if he had  recognized himself for the first time. (48) For Butler, such an invitation is itself com pelling: the subject turns, de- spite his or her ostensible guilt, because identity  is an offer that cannot be  refused. W ilde’s version, im agined as response or resistance to this scene,  reproduces its fo rm  bu t no t its content: D o rian ’s response to the picture  enacts a fantasy o f  self-hailing, in w hich  the self answers to its ow n desire  rather than to the adm onito ry  call o f  the law. W h at seems im portan t,  then , is n o t the undecidable status o f  the self that turns (must n o t that  self—so the question goes— already be a subject in o rder to turn?) bu t 22 Butler, Psychic Life of Power; 104. 23 Ibid., 108. </page> <page sequence="14"> Embodying Culture 171 rather the fact o f  the scene’s replication: the way b o th  A lthusser and  W ilde figure the production  o f  identity  as a tu rn , im agining identity  as  that w hich, in  a narrative o f  desire, the subject moves toward. W hat com - pels and confers identity, in  b o th  these scenarios, is n o th ing  o ther than   desire for it.24 A nd that desire, once again, is the desire to belong. T he self hailed here,  as in Althusser, is not, no r can it be, w holly self-appointed: it is rather the  effect o f  the existence o f  the group, o f  society. For if, as B utler suggests,  the desire for identity  is the desire to be constituted socially, then identity  m ust take shape as the image o f  social life.25 A nd so it does in  Dorian Gray.  In a discussion preceding D orian ’s arrival, Lord H enry  W otton  and Basil  Hallward discuss the partial nature o f  their ow n and others’ identities: one  possesses intellect and talent, another beauty, another wealth (“Your rank  and wealth, H arry; my brains, such as they are— m y art, w hatever it may  be w orth; D orian  Gray’s good looks”). D orian , in this conversation, is said  to possess only beauty: “H e is some brainless, beautiful creature, w ho   should always be here in  w in ter w h en  we have no flowers to  look at” (25),  and w hen  he appears he is indeed depicted as no t yet in possession o f  an  identity— as em pty and available for one.Yet at the end o f  this scene— the  scene in w hich Basil paints the famous portrait— D orian  possesses all the  qualities Henry, Basil, and form erly D orian  him self possessed individually.  Indeed, the apparent fluidity o f  identity  boundaries in  this scene is coun- tered  by the way D o rian ’s identity  emerges as the only one that counts  (there are three bodies here, bu t finally only one identity), and he is no t  only an image o f  the others’ desire bu t an em bodim ent o f  their very qual- ities: o f  Basil’s images and H en ry ’s words. 24 The very problem o f  the subject’s status in Althusser’s scenario suggests the answer I  propose in this chapter: the subject, “already” one, locates subjecthood outside the self be- cause cultural identity, which appears in such scenarios as identity tout court, is an external  construct. 25 “Called by an injurious name, I come into social being, and because I have a certain  inevitable attachment to my existence, because a certain narcissism takes hold o f  any term  that confers existence, I am led to embrace the terms that injure me because they consti- tute me socially” (Butler, Psychic Life of Power, 104). “Existence,” in this formulation, is the  same as being constituted socially: life is equated with cultural life, with existing within a  the context o f  a social group. 26 Lee Edelman, Homographesis (N ew  York: Routledge, 1994), 17. </page> <page sequence="15"> 172 The Aesthetics o f Cultural Identity As Lee Edelm an has argued, W ilde’s novel inscribes identity in a narra- tive o f  desire.26 From  the novel’s initial representations o f  D orian  as beau- tiful vacancy and potential, to the “lo o k ” that comes in to  the lad’s face that  Basil had never seen there before, to D o rian ’s “ recognition” o f  him self in  the portrait, identity  is som ething D orian  achieves in the p ic ture-painting  scene, and it is the result no t ju st o f  his ow n wish, bu t o f  the com bined  yearnings o f  all three. In these scenes, the group is im agined as a body, each  m em ber possessing some aspect o f  the w hole, and D orian  is the projected  image o f  that w hole— a com posite body. It is this wholeness that he rec- ognizes as if  for the first tim e in the portrait, this wholeness that makes the  picture the place he wants to occupy. Desire for D orian— including  D o rian ’s desire for him self as picture— is desire for the im agined w hole- ness o f  the group. Indeed, it is the impossibility o f  distinguishing betw een  desire for a particular individual and desire for cultural em bodim ent that  D o rian ’s wish to change places w ith  the picture defines, and that defines  the picture o f  D orian  Gray. Thus w hen  D o rian ’s image appears on  the canvas, the very picture o f   Basil’s desire for h im  and o f  H en ry ’s influence, no t only does the novel  dramatize w hat Ed C ohen  has called the inscription o f  hom oerotic desire,  bu t it also allegorizes the em ergence o f  cultural identity per se as an effect  o f  triangulated desire. It is the idea o f  culture that takes shape here in, and  as, an im aginary body, and the idea o f  the group— o f the self as an ideal- ized projection  o f  others— that enables the replacem ent, or at least the  overlapping, o f  the injurious nam e w ith  the beautiful face. If  the police- m an’s call is the call o f  the dom inant culture, defining the respondent as  guilty before the law, the alternative picture illustrates the reverse fantasy,  or fantasy o f  reversal: it is an allegory o f  being interpellated as an object o f   desire. Collapsing the difference Freud w ished to maintain, in his discus- sion o f  homosexuality, betw een desire for and possession o f  the other, it  suggests a fantasy o f  such perfect sympathy w ith  the o ther that the o ther  turns out to be, for better or worse, the self.27 Producing D o rian ’s idealized image, the painting scene thus allegorizes  the elem ent o f  desire that transforms practice into personhood.

A nd such a set o f  practices, as M ichaels’s ar- gum ent suggests, takes an em bodied form : culture is always w hat som eone  else (even, as Dorian Gray makes clear, o ne’s ow n self im agined as som e- one else) is doing. C ulture is n o t a “set” o f  practices (M ichaels’s definition)  bu t rather a reading o f  them : an in terpretation  that unifies disparate prac- tices, attaching m eaning to action and in  this way individualizing it, w ith   the idea o f  the individual— o f  actions perform ed by som eone— giving co- herence to the activity o f  the group. D orian  Gray thus figures in this ar- gum ent as an exemplary image o f  a person w ho is also an em bodim ent o f   culture— an em bodim ent o f  a particular culture, to be sure, bu t also an al- legory for the way culture in  general takes shape “as a k ind  o f  person.” B ut w hat kind o f  culture, and w hat k ind o f  person? T h e  rhetoric o f  ex- change— specifically, o f  changing places— that inform s D o rian ’s wish and  structures his story further reinforces the im portance o f  the idea o f  cul- ture in  the im agining o f  m odern  identities. For the self, even w hen  im ag- ined as o ne’s ow n, is constituted w ith  reference to an external image. It is  p ictured  elsewhere: in  D orian  Gray’s case, in the form  o f  an image readily  available w ith in  and appropriated from  the dom inant culture (an image,  w e m ight go so far as to say, o f  the dom inant culture. For the beautiful  face, m aking no secret o f  its desirability, defines the dom inant culture’s re- quirem ents for beauty; hence its class determ ination: aristocratic— and its  national one: English). D orian  symbolizes his era in  m ore ways than one:  his beauty is no m ore idealized w ith in  the context o f  his coterie than in  V ictorian  England generally, and it is the abstractness o f  that beauty, o f   course— the protean significance o f  his cultural ideality— that enables no t  only D orian, bu t the novel itself, to “pass.” A nd here the narrative o f  identity  politics gives way— briefly— to that  o f  cosmetology: to the very real (no longer magical, that is) business o f   choosing a face. D orian  wishes, o f  course, for bo th  faces, the beautiful and the ugly—   n o t for one or the other, but rather for the exchange betw een them . A nd  his desire is fulfilled n o t just by the beautiful face b u t by the ugly one, w ith   its marks and blotches, as well— and by the way each supplem ents the  other, each suggests m eanings the o ther fails to provide. For despite the  exchangeability o f  images discussed earlier in  this chapter, W ilde s novel  does attribute value to  ugliness.

B ut it also reflects a process o f  accum ulation: the portrait  turns sin into gain by rendering it visible. This is, after all, w here D o rian ’s  actions appear, w here his experience accumulates like capital. Like a miser  visiting his wealth, D orian  obsessively checks his profits, each blotch and  w rink le challenging the novel’s m oralizing w ith  an equally com pelling  logic o f  accum ulation. D espite the absence o f  individuality the novel’s  general representation o f  ugliness suggests, then, the accum ulation o f   marks on  the p ic ture’s surface does suggest the possibility o f  individuality:  here, at least, som ething is happening. W hy, then, is it no t a pretty picture? In the M urad  advertisem ent (Fig. i), an advertisem ent for a w rink le-  rem oving cream  for w om en  and a suggestive updating and revision o f   D orian  Gray’s picture, the lines on the w om an’s face are replaced by— are,  indeed, only visible as— the advertiser’s lines, labeled w ith  the contents o f   a cultural narrative (and directed toward bo th  the w om an’s image and the  spectator— “the day you totaled the car”): the projected replacem ent o f   one face w ith  another replaces one narrative w ith  another. T he  face (and,  indeed, the identity  o f  its owner) is thus figured as a k ind o f  map, each  m ark rendering  experience visible, denoting  a site at w h ich  som ething  happened. B ut o f  course rather than simply m aking the invisible visible,  the marks denote the absence o f  anything but cultural narrative: the map,  like D o rian ’s hideous portrait, figures the inseparability o f  “real” self and  cultural projection. Since identity  becom es visible only w hen  m arked as cultural narrative,  bo th  identities— the ugly (or less desirable) and the beautiful— appear as  pictures (hence, as in my analysis o f  “A Christmas Carol,” visibility itself  signals and evokes desire, the distance betw een the self and its representa- tions) .Yet the fantasy, and the parallel in contem porary  culture, is that one  can participate in (embody) cultural value w ithou t giving up o ne’s true  self. In the advertisem ent as in  W ilde’s novel the “ugly” self occupies the  position o f  the real, and is similarly im agined as detachable: that to w hich  one necessarily refers, o n e’s undesirable face is also— as in V ictorian scenes  o f  sympathy— that w hich  one need n o t (but for the grace o f  God, and  plastic surgery) acknowledge, or, indeed, be. And, again as in Dorian Gray;  and Deronda as well, the ugly face is the particularized face, the attractive  face generalized— its evacuation o f  experience rendering it available for a </page> <page sequence="18"> Fig. i .

This advertisem ent’s persuasive- ness relies on its ability to appeal to a spectator w ho wants to erase, but also  values, experience’s marks: w ith  its labels insisting on the very debilities the  cream is to erase, the ad suggests no t exactly (or no t only) the effacement o f   experience but rather its dem aterialization or internalization. Like Dorian  Gray; it offers the spectator an opportunity  to em body the cultural ideal yet  preserve an alternative, “authentic” self—not exactly keeping the body that  records that experience, but rather maintaining as m ental picture the m em - ory o f  such a body (though perhaps w ith  less energy than one devotes to  actively maintaining, or attem pting to achieve, the culturally idealized one).  D orian ’s obsessive return  to his hideous image— the way he commits his  “sins” in a spirit o f  scientific inquiry in  order to gauge their effect on  the  picture (124), and m ore tellingly the way he finds him self “enam oured” o f   it (135)— suggests a similar desire for a self that isn’t picture perfect: a self one  can call one s own* For the attraction o f  the ugly self, here as in the case o f   H ugh Boone, that hideous m an w ith the twisted lip, is the lure o f  authen^  ticity: o f  the cultural authority granted the idea o f  the true self R ead  thus,  as a narrative about a choice o f  cultural narratives, W ilde’s novel may appear  to be less about sin— either sin in general or any particular variety— than it  is about the eroticization o f  particular images o f  cultural identity and o f  the  idea o f  cultural identity itself.29 28 Here, as in Daniel Deronda, it becomes evident that the generalized character— the  type— is by definition a sympathetic object, the projection o f  a collective fantasy about the  group’s desires and about the way it views, or wishes to view, itself. 29 Even as the m edical/juridical establishment creates a type, D ow ling’s analysis sug- gests, a cultural tradition for that type emerges— deliberately and self-consciously, using as  its framework another, previously existing tradition. The form that the “coded counterdis- course” o f  homosexuality takes, in D ow ling’s reading (Hellenism and Homosexuality, xv),  literalizes my claim in this chapter— the claim that culture is always someone else s— at the  same time that it deconstructs the idea o f  an “original” tradition by suggesting that tradi- tions always emerge in discourse with one another. </page> <page sequence="20"> Embodying Culture 177 T he idea o f  culture invests a single person’s actions w ith  the identity, or  shared m eaning, o f  the group; pu t another way, in  cultural identity  the  identity  o f  the group is discernible— made palpable— in a single person’s  actions. Culture, according to this logic, is always em bodied, always a m at- ter o f  value manifested in som eone’s appearance, som eone’s place. Indeed,  as a m atter o f  im agining the o ther as a person w ith  w h o m  one w ould like  to change places (“ I w ish I could change places w ith  you, D orian,” says  Lord H enry  wistfully [256]), cultural identity  collapses person into place:  identity  becom es a cultural position, a place one can occupy. A nd just as  culture depends on the illusion that a practice is m ore than a practice, so  too  does changing places substitute being for doing— so that culture  makes itself, and reproduces itself, by substituting identity  for practice,  im agining practice in em bodied form . T he scenario o f  “changing places”  short-circuits a scenario o f  im itation (I do w hat you do) w ith  a scenario  o f  replaced identity  (I becom e you, pu t myself in your place) in  w hich  identity, seemingly kept intact, in fact is revealed as no th ing  m ore than a  function o f  place. P ictured outside the self, the identity  one wants— w hich  one wants because it is pictured— appears knowable and available for oc- cupation. (In the w orld according to Dorian Gray— the w orld  that, the  M urad  ad tells us, we still inhabit— there is always a m ore desirable version  o f  “y ou” out there.) “C hanging places” replaces narrative and tem porality  w ith  substitution and magic, exchanging a condition  o f  desire in w hich  identity  is always slipping away w ith  one in  w hich  identity is to be had for  the asking— or the wishing. Even as it is said to signal the new  visibility, the em ergence into public  light, o f  late-V ictorian  hom osexual culture, then, The Picture o f Dorian  Gray allegorizes the general desire that transforms practice in to  culture,  that marks the difference betw een practice and culture. C ulture appears  here as a structure in w hich  practices have m eaning precisely because, and  only because, som eone else is perform ing them .30 W hy is it, I have asked  o f  Foucault’s account o f  n ineteen th -cen tu ry  identities, that individuals no t  only accept the term s o f  their m edicalization, but they take on  those iden- tities, begin to speak “in their ow n behalf”? T he eroticization and ideal- ization o f  group identity  in the projection o f  an im aginary body figures  cu lture’s invitation to  spectators to recognize themselves— and seek to 30 This formulation is obviously indebted to R ené Girard’s idea o f  triangular desire. </page> <page sequence="21"> 178 The Aesthetics o f  Cultural Identity place themselves— in a symbolic structure not o f  their own creation.  Dorian s beauty signals the (illusory) achievement o f  an identification with   culture itself: it is the beauty o f  identity as wish-fulfillment, a fantasy o f   experience invested with value. Desire for Dorian captures the lure o f  cul- tural narrative as the context in which, at a historical m om ent w hich is  ours as much as Dorian Gray s, self-recognition can and does take place.  Identity as this novel figures it— and, I have suggested, in contemporary  identity politics as well— is the imagined occupation o f  a place in a cul- tural narrative, a place that takes visible form as an imaginary body whose  identification with the group gives new meaning to the visual fullness o f   the Lacanian imaginary. Diana Fuss has defined identity politics as “the tendency to base one s  politics on a sense o f  personal identity— as gay, as Jewish, as Black, as fe- male.”31 But this definition classifies as personal what are obviously terms  o f  group affiliation, terms whose appropriation guarantees visibility in the  symbolic realms o f  culture and politics. In the m odel I have described  here, identity politics is reconceived, following the m odel o f  late-  nineteenth-century ideologies, as the creation o f  a desirable identity, its  mechanism the projection o f  that identity in an imaginary body. That  same desire for visibility— without, o f  course, the accompanying political  concern— is manifest in the desire to embody a spectacularized, mass-  producèd version o f  beauty. In both cases, cultural identity takes shape as  an implicit opposition between images o f  ideality and degradation; in  both, identity is constituted as an exchange between identities— identities  imagined, finally, as different versions o f  the self. The body imagined as desirable, I have suggested, is the body o f  cul- ture: a projection o f  the image o f  culture itself as an imaginary body. Such  a formation depends not just on the desirability o f  particular identities but  on the positing o f  identity itself as desirable: as that with which everyone  must identify, that which everyone must desire. Thus embodied, identity  presents itself as something to be desired, something to be wished for,  something others could imagine being. Imagining identity as a body  whose place a spectator may wish to occupy, and as a person with w hom   one might like to change places, W ilde s novel renders visible the element 31 Diana Fuss, Essentially Speaking (N ew  York: R outledge, 1994), 103. </page> <page sequence="22"> Embodying Culture 179 o f  desire— and the transformations o f  sympathy— out o f  w hich  cultures  are made. T he  sympathetic spectator does no t, as w e have seen, sympathize w ith   everyone— least o f  all w hen  sympathy is explicitly linked to  self-  identification, as in identity politics. In this way, identity  politics calls into  question the ostensible universality, or blankness, o f  the ethical, liberal sub- jec t— the subject, as E liot demonstrates in Daniel Deronda, w hose identity  is m eant to transcend the logic o f  group identity on  w hich  it is founded.  In E lio t’s novel as in W ilde’s, and elsewhere in  this book, the rhetoric o f   exchangeability and im personality on w hich  liberal subjectivity rests— the  equalizing gesture o f  “ there but for the grace o f  G o d ”— is circum scribed  by the particularity o f  the subject’s identifications. F rom  this perspective,  the illustration from  A dam  Sm ith w ith  w hich  I began— his con ten tion   that, try  as we m ight to im agine ourselves in  ano ther’s place, we are lim - ited to the evidence o f  our ow n experiences— may be new ly understood  to suggest the way claims for the imaginative possibilities o f  sympathy in  W estern liberal though t are underm ined  by the very structures o f  group  identity  w ith in  w hich  m odern  identities are im agined. To return, then, to M ichaels’s problem  w ith  the personification o f  cul- ture: the problem  (if it is one) is no t that we im agine culture as a person,  and that we could have it some o ther way T he problem  is that culture is,  essentially, the im agining o f  the self in another’s place (or, as in Dorian Gray  in another place): a fantasy o f  participating in an experience that has m ean- ing precisely because it is em bodied, because it is— at least figuratively—   som eone else’s. A nd the logic o f  culture, at least in this account— involv- ing as it does the externalization o f  identity, the nagging feeling that o ne’s  real self is really som ewhere else— is sympathy’s logic as well. T here is no  less desire in the eye that turns toward the beggar than there is in D orian   Gray’s eye as it turns toward his beautiful picture, for to the extent that the  beggar figures the “tru th ” o f  middle-class identity, and allows for the con- struction o f  an idealized, culturally valued alternative, his gaze will attract  that o f  the subject w ho, professedly, w ould rather look away. </page> <page sequence="23">  </page> </plain_text>
