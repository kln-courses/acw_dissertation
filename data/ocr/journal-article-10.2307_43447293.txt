And in characterizing that posture, it is primarily Stanley Fish to whom she alludes: "Browne does not, it is argued, pursue the logical consequences of the paradoxes he sets up, nor does he feel their emotional pull with sufficient sensitivity."1 Although Drury Hall considerably softens Fish's polemic, these are the terms in which he denounces Browne's prose, religious sen- sibility, and intellect (as Drury Hall discreetly acknowledges in a footnote).2 And yet, although I too resist Fish's substantive argument against the Religio Medici , I must still admit his peripheral point that Browne's admirers protest too much - that they are as embarrassed as Fish is scornful of its religious via media , its implicit political conserva- tism, and especially the lusciousness of its language.3 Perhaps it is just such critical embarrassment that obliges Hall to fashion a hybrid genre which might justify Browne's peculiarly egoistic discourse, that compels Raymond Waddington to secure some topical structure that might contain the text's almost random expatiations,4 and forces Leonard Nathanson to expound a whole ideology - Christian Plato- I.

Perhaps we cannot understand or share Browne's extenuating temper and theology, much less applaud his unrepentant rhetoricity. So notwithstanding Fish's permission to en- joy the Religio Medici , our enjoyment remains a guilty pleasure, sought at the expense of nobler or at least more exacting texts. Like the contemporary readers for whom Browne ultimately pub- lishes the Religio , critics do not easily suspend their own terms or logic of analysis, much less admit the usefulness of a different grammar in reconceiving what we all presume to understand. I would argue that Browne's seemingly intransigent verbalism is just that, a novel gram- mar that tests our complacency about the world and the discourse with which we describe it. While the Religio does not practice Fish's aporia of naive reference, it does trace the extent to which the sym- bolic demarcations of language are made to enforce and reciprocally define the boundaries of seventeenth-century sectarian politics. In the process the text's patent artifice serves both as the critical instrument of his theology and as the sign of Browne's conscience in religious matters, not his serenity or self-satisfaction. Let me begin by examining a passage rife with what Fish regards as the Religio's illicit satisfactions: It is not, I confesse, an unlawfull Prayer to desire to surpasse the dayes of our Saviour, or wish to out-live that age wherein he thought fittest to dye, yet, if (as Divinity affirmes) there shall be no gray hayres in Heaven, but all shall rise in the perfect state of men, we doe but out-live those perfections in this world, to be recalled unto them, by a greater miracle in the next, and run on here, but to be retrogade hereafter. Were there any hopes to out-live vice, or a point to be super-annuated from sin, it were worthy our knees to implore the dayes of Methuselah. But age doth not rectifie, but incurvate our natures, turning bad dispositions into worser habits, and (like diseases) brings on incurable vices; for every day as we grow weaker in age, we grow stronger in sinne, and the number of our dayes doth but make our sinnes innumerable. The same vice committed at sixteene, is not the same, though it agree in all other circumstances, at forty, but swels and doubles from the circumstance of our ages, wherein besides the constant and inexcusable habit of transgress- 5.

Therefore I perceive a man may bee twice a child before the dayes of dotage, and stand in need of AEsons bath before three- score.6 The seductiveness of Browne's discourse is not at issue, but rather the purpose of its verbal contrivance (that it is designed we may infer from Browne's addition to the 1643 edition of the last similitude and paradox, beginning "And though I thinke no man can live well once" [p. 11311]). Does thé passage constitute a gratuitous amplificatio on sin and age, with Browne not so much indicting as ameliorating our moral guilt by his repetitions, metaphors, allusions, Latinisms, an- titheses, paradoxes and sheer ingenuity of figuration? Or does it possess a legitimate, even rational economy which assists the reader to admit the inexorability of human corruption, as well as the decep- tion latent in the rhetoric of moral progress - that judgment, if not age, perfects virtue? Usually epideixis entails the static but sensuously rich iteration of an idea, in that the writer may elaborate his point in different terms, yet without signalling any actual analytical move- ment in his discussion. But Browne's putative excursus on age com- prises a delicate apparatus of inference, which moves from the rever- sal of our earthly notions of progress and decline ("we run on here but to be retrograde hereafter" and thus to revert to our physical prime) to the ironical reflection that to advance in years is to perfect vice. Here cumulative sin is conveyed by comparatives, conditional relations (as . . . as), a simile likening this twofold decay to mathematical sums ("as they proceed they ever multiply, and like figures in Arithmeticke, 6.

He then con- cludes with an analogy that equates metaphysical decline with ac- cumulated years, translating both into the paradox of moral infancy and decrepitude. This intricate figuration serves to examine the passage's express question, what it means to "out-live" Christ, to which Browne re- plies not with a sophism (as Fish contends), but with a paradox probing an intimate human dilemma: namely, how can we meet faith's demand that we relinquish not only the criteria but also the terms and relations by which we reckon value in this life? Two intellectual failures provoke Browne's exhortation to his reader (for exhortation is precisely the activity in which this passage and the whole Religio Medici engage: by Browne's private inquiry, to incite the reader to a perception of temporal things that appropriately nego- tiates the boundaries of reason and faith). First, our understanding of this world recognizes only its material and sensual aspects, expressed here by the dubious calculation of "outliving" Christ; and second, language in its character as human artifact not only reproduces but reinforces our spiritual blindness. It is these defects of intellection that Browne's putative verbalism works to remedy, and by no facile or inconsiderate exercise of terms. Rather, the very opacity of his dis- course provides a commentary on our benighted apprehension of things: we must be made conscious of the assumptions predicating both a failure of intellect and faith, and that in turn requires that we be confronted with the agent which embeds and propagates such as- sumptions - language itself. Accordingly, Browne accentuates the artificial and as it were plastic nature of discourse as both the perpetra- tor of wrong ideas and the means of our cognitive reform. Palpable, ineluctable artifice resists the presumed transparency of language - the belief that its grammar faithfully reproduces some universal real- ity. But Browne does not want simply to extinguish our confidence in language, so that we are compelled to discard it and by implication the world beyond human ideas (a gesture Fish appears to regard as the sole index of integrity in discourse).7 As Browne desires to adjust the reader's experience by analogy to his own, so he desires to extend his "new creation" to the very elements of language. What distinguishes Browne's mode of paradoxical discourse from Donne's is the pleasure 7. See Fish, pp. 41-43.</page><page sequence="5">Victoria Silver 73 of the physician and natural philosopher in this partial world of experience, language, and society, in which all Christians must first make their way. While Browne has not been accused of ingenuous or simple- minded euphuism, he has been charged with writing nonsense that his figuration happily disguises. But although he does pursue verbal effects with some urgency, he does something different with them than rather loosely refract and complicate representation as Lyly and Ascham do. By making his language conspicuously artful, he invites the reader to conceive his discourse sceptically and with a full con- sciousness that language remains a human device and consolation (for our mortality and the diminuation of human knowledge with the Fall), to be reshaped and adjusted in the service of human concerns. This material or dimensional sense of language in the Religio Medici , which its sheer opacity demands we acknowledge, enables Browne to employ, say, a figure of repetition as egregiously as Ascham but now to a distinctively analytical and symbolic purpose. Thus, in the clause "as it succeeds in time, so it precedes in degrees of badnesse, for as they proceed they ever multiply," the verbs "succeed," "precede" and "proceed" play on the Latin root cedere ("to move or go in motion"): together they parody sin s progress and ironize the measurement of the metaphysical by expanding vice exponentially, and with it the complicity of human will. To much the same purpose, each antithesis preliminary to Browne's final paradox anticipates and interprets its conflict of material and immaterial worlds, gradually translating the glib aphorism - "no man can live well once but hee that could live twice" - into a complex similitude which more shrewdly adjudicates the claims of judgment and desire, not to mention the insistent lin- earity of human discourse. That Browne exercises his considerable imagination on discourse itself, as represented here by the aphorism, signifies its own material and often specious character: as he finds the proposition too neat, so he sets out to compose a verbal fugue on its claims whose several variations anatomize and eventually deny their validity. Thus one figure subverts another, and language frankly delimits its own force. Although words abuse the nature of this world, they can still be made to do it justice after a fashion. So in Browne's text, rhetoricity becomes a symbolic, cognitive theater for the reader, in which figuration predicates spiritual laws and distinc- tions while simultaneously disclosing that it only impersonates or</page><page sequence="6">74 English Literary Renaissance simulates their operation. Briefly, Browne does not invalidate all discourse because it cannot directly apprehend some recondite, ineffa- ble dimension of being, or more importantly, because its representa- tions valorize their own terms to such an extent that they become a self-authenticating, exclusive reality. Rather, he invokes the media- tion of language in showing how God has accommodated himself to the mind in his own artifacts - nature, scripture, and human being. But because this revelation is both elusive and disguised by matter, sense, and the corruption of reason, the Religio does not so much contain or prove them as propound a symbolic means by which the reader can glimpse God's presence privately, that is, by a conversion of ideas similar to that which Browne practices in his text. The essay represents not so much Browne's conclusions as his method: his opinions, purveyed as a kind of Brunonian confession for the reader to admire, are not the point; they serve only to illustrate a mode of reading and understanding this life's manifold phenomena by the criteria of faith. The Religio is an individual act of reformation as well as hermeneutics, in the manner described by most Protestant exeget- ical theory, but without any attempt on Browne's part to invoke supernal authority or presence. Instead, as Browne exercises his own mind on scripture, doctrine, secular philosophies, nature and lan- guage itself, so he frees his reader both from the prejudicial assump- tions which blind us to the communion of all things in God, and from the equally perverse notion that we can know God other than as he chooses to reveal himself - contingently and mediately. In sum, he enfranchises only to circumscribe the power of reason and discourse in the pursuit of faith, and his figuration performs this dual action both textually and symbolically. That the Religio Medici was published in the 1640s, in the midst of a pamphlet war presaging the eventual military conflict, is germane to understanding Browne's "private exercise" (p. 59). Some have chosen to read the 1643 preface as a claim for the essay's neutrality, if not its indifference to the issues inciting civil war,8 given that Browne takes care to mention that he wrote it "about seven years past" and that "the 8. An example of this tack would be William F. Dunn in his book, Sir Thomas Browne: A Study in Religious Philosophy (Minneapolis, Minn., 1950), pp. 51-53- While Dunn in no way diminishes the pertinence of Browne s religious position to contemporary theological issues, he tacitly disallows it any direct political import, remarking that the essay "belongs to the class of informal books whose intention is candid self-revelation rather than argument" (p. 51).</page><page sequence="7">Victoria Silver 75 intention was not publik" (p. 59). Others have seen it as a partisan tract placing Browne in the Laudian, monarchist camp against the dissenters, parliament, and the triumph of republicanism.9 In all like- lihood, he composed the essay as he describes, in the middle to late 1630s; and more certainly, he made numerous and occasionally sub- stantial revisions for the authorized edition, which suggest his con- sciousness of its topicality. Moreover, his criticism of the press has less to do with the theft of his own writings (something he represents largely as an embarrassment), than with sectarian polemics, which he does not scruple to call "the highest perversion of that excellent invention," remarking that with "the name of his Majesty defamed, the honour of Parliament depraved, the writings of both depra vedly, anticipatively, counterfeitly imprinted, complaints may seeme ridicu- lous in private persons" (p. 59). Considered even by the decorum of seventeenth-century polemics, this is no timid criticism, nor is his accusation politic that "things evidently false are not onely printed, but many things of truth most falsly set forth" (p. 59). Nevertheless, Browne's complaint does not directly assert a politi- cal position, enlisting the Religio in pamphlet-battles. His concern lies with the principles, not the particulars, of the current debate, which the essay originally addressed as a matter of personal inquiry, only to become in the course of things a public contribution which Browne was finally not reluctant to make. If Browne assumes a political position, it is against the very bases of sectarian conflict - our pre- sumption in laying claim to certain truth in matters of religious doctrine - and the products of such human arrogance, systematic theology, dogmas, creeds, heresies, proscriptions, factions, prejudice and the gradual disintegration of church unity. Initially his is a theo- logical view, composed less in response to the fear of Roman Catholi- cism or the incipient chaos of English politics than to new dilemmas in Reformed doctrine, especially a near-explosion of credal dogmas, which imply distinct ecclesiastical positions such as Erastianism or theonomy.10 The Religio contributes to a varied liberal strain in Re- 9. Thus Michael Wilding's article, " Religio Medici in the English Revolution" ( Approaches to Sir Thomas Browne, ed. C. A. Patrides, pp. 100-14), emphasizes the "ideological significance" of Browne's essay, and his "participation in the sociopolitical debate of the English Revolution, " although Wilding "locates" the Religio and its arguments for religious tolerance on what he clearly regards as the wrong side (p. 10 1). 10. The Dutch Arminians or Remonstrants, for example, were obliged to assume an explicit Erastianism simply in order to preach and assemble, given that their orthodox Calvinist</page><page sequence="8">7 6 English Literary Renaissance formed theology, of which Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity (1597) was perhaps the most systematic statement in English, but which also received dramatic impetus from the silencing of the Remonstrants by the Synod of Dort (161 8), and the predicament of the Dutch theologian, Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609), whose writ- ings at once incited that controversy and ironically predicted its out- come.11 II Arminius' theology entails both a soteriological position, and an exegetical theory premised upon it. His soteriology consists in a specific reassessment or reorganization of the Reformed doctrine of predestination, in response to the supralapsarian view promulgated by Theodore Beza, the Heidelberg theologians Zacharias Ursinus, Kaspar Olevianus and Girolamo Zanchius, and William Perkins, among many others.12 Simply put, supralapsarianism argues that opponents perpetually sought to bring the full weight of secular as well as ecclesiastical govern- ment to bear against them. For a lucid account of the Dutch controversy and the politics it implicated, see A. W. Harrison's Arminianism (London, 1937), pp. 43-96. The politics of so- called Arminianism in English is further complicated by its conflation (in the minds of both contemporaries and religious historians) with Laudianism, from which it remains theologically, and in the matter of religious tolerance, politically distinct. Two discussions intelligently delineating and practicing this conflation are Nicholas Tyacke's "Puritanism, Arminianism and Counter-Revolution" (in The Origins of the English Civil War, ed. Conrad Russell, London, 1973, pp. 119-43); and Dewey D. Wallace's Puritans and Predestination: Grace in English Protestant Theology 1525-1695 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1982), esp. pp. 65-111. As Patrick Collinson remarks, Arminianism in English usage signified "a portmanteau of religious attitudes," many of which had nothing to do with the intra-Calvinist dissent represented by the Dutch Remonstrants, or such proper Arminian theologians as William Chilling worth or Jeremy Taylor. See Collinson 's analysis of the problem in International Calvinism 1541-1715 (Oxford, 1985), pp. 213-23. ii. In addition to Harrison's account of Arminius' life and theology, see Carl Bangs, Arminius: A Study in the Dutch Reformation, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1985). My discussion of Arminian theology per se, both on the continent and in England, is also indebted to John Tulloch's Rational Theology and Christian Philosophy in England in the Seventeenth Century, 2 vols., 2nd ed. (London, 1874); Henry McAdoo's The Spirit of Anglicanism: A Survey of Anglican Theological Method in the Seventeenth Century (New York, 1965); and with some disagreements, to Herschel Baker's magisterial The Wars of Truth: Studies in the Decay of Christian Humanism in the Earlier Seventeenth Century (Gloucester, Mass., 1969). 12.

Armstrong's Calvinism and</page><page sequence="9">Victoria Silver 77 God's decree electing believers to salvation precedes the decree of creation and thus the fall of humanity. By making election precedent to creation and conflating divine foreknowledge with divine will, the supralapsarians designedly eliminate any human role and thus all contingency - on our desire or judgment, on the disposition to be- lieve or disbelieve the promise of the gospel - from God's discrimina- tion of the elect from the reprobate. Salvation then becomes an abso- lute and accordingly arbitrary expression of what the supralapsarians were inclined to call God's "own good pleasure," as well as the autonomy of divine justice and mercy. Further, the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice and intercession is circumscribed so as to embrace not all humanity but only those God predetermines to elect. In this reading, the crucial events of original disobedience, vicarious atonement and redemption, and faith in this life lose their historical and pivotal force in the salvific economy. They are reduced instead to mere affirmations of divine power, a sort of temporal tabulation or procedure by which God remotely and indifferently institutes salvation. The supralap- sarian position also marginalizes, however inadvertently, the person of Jesus Christ and his sacrificial and mediating agency. The coopera- tive and loving God he manifests in history is effectively sacrificed to a demonstration of impassive omnipotency. Moreover, such a formal excision of human motive from God's election of believers (and to some extent, as regards Christ's voluntary act, divine motive as well) retracts one of the few but significant means by which a person might not only participate in her or his salvation, but be assured of its reality. If the instrument by which God enacts this saving decree - an imper- sonal and irresistible grace imposed by the Holy Spirit - excludes conscious or deliberate assent, and if the operation of such grace (as many Reformed theologians argued after Calvin) cannot be distin- guished except by vague affective evidence from a false sense of the Amyraut Heresy: Protestant Scholasticism and Humanism in Seventeenth-Century France (Madi- son, Wise., 1969); and R. T. Kendall's Calvin and English Calvinism to 164g (Oxford, 1979). For supralapsarianism in England and colonial America, Perkin's Golden Chain or the Description of Theology and Ames Marrow of Theology are especially important. Finally, my account owes a great deal to Arminius' own analysis of the implications of supralapsarianism: see especially his A declaration of the sentiments of Arminius, on predestination, divine providence ... I, 580-732; Disputations on some of the principal subjects of the Christian religion II, 72-317; Examination of the theses of Dr. Francis Gomanus respecting predestination III, 522-658, in The Works of James Arminius, tr.

While the purpose of supralapsarianism was expressly to insure God's preeminence in effecting salvation, a preeminence originally sought by Luther and Calvin to repudiate the salvific claims made by the Catholic church, it created and exemplified a problem in Re- formed doctrine beyond that pastoral crisis precipitated when be- lievers are refused access to some intelligible proof of their faith. Where Calvin himself describes faith as an arbitrary benefit dispensed to a passive and oblivious (because depraved) population, his suc- cessors translate this irrationalist soteriology into a means of exegesis and the authorization of doctrine.14 In Reformed theology generally, faith consists in crediting or assenting to the propositions that Christ died to atone for human sin, thereby restoring to relationship with God and finally to salvation those who believe in his sacrifice and mediation. Scripture is both the single authoritative source of this knowledge and, with grace, the means by which faith is inculcated. But inasmuch as saving knowledge in the Calvinist scheme is ac- quired without the cooperation of human desire or judgment, and since the true deciphering of scripture itself precludes rational under- standing to depend solely on an irresistible conviction, renewed con- tinuously in the elect, then all subsequent readings of scripture must be empowered by the same impersonal, irrational agency, and can thus appropriate the same divine dispensation and mechanism as faith itself. It follows that the doctrine educed from scripture by such an extraordinary means of illumination arguably enjoys a similar ex- emption from human understanding and assent to faith itself. That is, it need not meet rational criteria insofar as it appears minimally congruent with the text. Assisted as they are by divine grace, such readings assume a kind of genetic infallibility, which while rarely invoked in doctrinal polemics, appears in the susceptibility of much Reformed theology to the discovery and institution of new dogmas. 15 13. See Kendall's thoughtful discussion of the "practical syllogism," the evidentiary instru- ment offered believers by which they might ascertain their justification, and its pastoral implica- tions ( Calvin and English Calvinism, pp. 32-76).

Thus the supralapsarian view of predestination could freely collapse the historical and to that extent comprehensible narrative of salvation into a syllogistic mystery: as recounted in scripture, the events of salvation have a significant concatenation, shaped by the motives and actions of both divine and human agents. But as defined by the supralapsarians, providential history with its grammar of events and motives is impertinent and meaningless to a God whose first concern is the implacable exercise of prerogative. Predestination, which both Arminius and his opponents call the heart of the gospel, becomes a sacrosanct doctrine one can neither investigate nor deny. Ill This embargo on rational access to religious knowledge, whether intellective or textual, moves Arminius to reassert the role of free will in salvation and to advocate the open, institutional debate of doctrine, as well as the strict delimitation of dogma.16 As against the supralap- sarian position, he places creation before election in the sequence of divine decrees, and so restores not only Christ's initiative to the redemptive scheme but also its supreme value, divine love - the sacri- fice of both father and son in order to reconvene relationship with their creation. Accordingly, he construes atonement and intercession as applying to all humanity, and by the conjoint action of prevenient grace and the enunciation of the gospel, predicates a universal call to repentance and faith. Most importantly, in this general assisting or anticipating grace, Arminius postulates our individual capacity to assent to or repudiate the salvific call or "vocation" which scripture inscribes - a choice God foresees but leaves unconstrained, and on which rests ultimate election or reprobation. 1 6.

For an informed discussion of all three works, see Bang, Arminius, pp. 186-221.</page><page sequence="12">8o English Literary Renaissance Arminius' argument for conditional predestination thus permits human desire and judgment - namely, liberum arbitrium or free will - to participate in its own reform by apprehending however partially the meaning of the scriptural text and the good it propounds. His enfranchisement of reason at this juncture is scarcely absolute or optimistic: rather, Arminius intends to liberate both God and human- ity from a concept of necessity (as regards God's expression of divine attributes, the operation of grace, and the corruption of the human mind) which, for all the protests of the supralapsarians, approaches the most fixed and schematic determinism - impoverishing the gos- pel and ultimately implicating God in the creation of evil. His more prudential motive is of course doctrinal: as his own exegetical practice indicates, Arminius wishes to preserve the grammatical-historical method and the moral focus of Reformed theology, which is to admit contingency into the reading of scripture and the production of doc- trine.17 Such concerns demand a critical mode of exegesis: a repudia- tion of interpretive literalism, and a corresponding attention first, to the ambiguity, obscurity, and polyvalency of the text; next, to its unitary arguments as principles governing and constraining inter- pretation; and finally, to the pastoral validity of those principles. It follows from these exegetical provisos that propositions or articles essential to orthodoxy are necessarily restricted to the few which the text clearly propounds. Finally, Arminius' program assumes the pos- sibility of rational and thus interpretive error, and so distinguishes between the infallible signification of scripture and the meanings educed from its text. This distinction is itself liberating, since it implies each individual's obligation to prophesy or construe the text, as well as the consequent instability of doctrine, and so invokes the need for consensual inquiry and agreement within the church to secure orthodoxy. Given this necessary activity of consensus, not to mention the vagaries and contradictions of human interpretation, Arminius' enfranchisement of reason in no way constitutes either a Pelagian or Socinian estimation of its capacities. In his theology, the use of reason not only presupposes both its bias and inadequacy, and therefore the remedial assistance of divine grace, but his purpose in 17.

McKim, The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach (San Francisco, Cal., 1979), pp. 83-86.

To admit reason either procedurally or implicitly within the precincts of religion requires a confession of its fallibility. Thus he does not seek to emulate Aquinas in extending to rational inquiry a speculative scope - that is, presuming by ratiocination to supply God's interstitial meanings in scripture.18 It is just this presumption in the supralap- sarians that he abhors, and which the presence of a tentative and chastened reason in exegesis prohibits. In sum, Arminius argues for a voluntary and experimental faith, for a sceptical theology premised on the necessary but fallible opera- tions of human reason, and not least for the strict delimitation of dogmas and so for religious tolerance and charity emulating Gods own. But events circumvented his appeal: the urgent vigor of Cath- olic imperialism and counterreform, and its own practical need to contain the very religious individualism it had prompted, impelled the Dutch Reformed church to seek uniformity by the imposition of dogmas, and with the Synod of Dort, by the exclusion of dissenters. Nor were the Dutch singular in their response: throughout Protestant and Catholic Europe, there was a general entrenchment of mandatory doctrine, assisted by the same interpretive irrationalism which begat the horridum decretum of supralapsarianism. For the most part, Euro- pean Calvinism would become scholastic, narrowing and ossifying in its theology, only to fragment into a plethora of partisan churches. "Arminianism" itself became a byword for the subversion of Re- formed orthodoxy, so that those who sympathized with the Re- monstrant cause, much less Arminius' critique of Calvinist dogma- tics, felt compelled to deny affiliation with the bare term. Despite this violent and largely unconsidered reaction against so- called Arminianism, the liberal theology Arminius actually espoused had other advocates in the Reformed church. Although conceived in terms of natural and positive law, Hooker's argument parallels Armi- nius' both by making salvation conditional upon human desire and 1 8.

By arguing from Arminius, I anticipate a comparable scepticism to Taylor's in both Chillingworth and Hales, and to a lesser extent, given the positive force of probablism in his theology, in Hooker, Milton, who shares wtih Arminius the conditional view of God's decrees as well as a rational, voluntarist theory of faith and exegesis, is sui generis.</page><page sequence="14">82 English Literary Renaissance judgment, and by placing both the education and authority of ines- sential doctrine in the domain of a flawed but regenerate reason. Thus Hooker asserts (and in the Dublin fragments on predestination, stren- uously upholds) the depravity of the human mind and, as a conse- quence, "our common imbecility" and utter dependence on divine grace in all matters pertaining to faith.19 Hooker's "reason" is sim- ilarly the fallible but indispensable instrument of exegesis and doc- trine, permitting the church a prudential response to the exigencies of its own mutable condition, premised on probable - that is to say, rationally demonstrable but not certain - inferences from scripture, to which a consensus of the church has assented. On this basis, reason assisted by grace and affirmed by the historic opinion or tradition of the church, Hooker in fact establishes the authority and centrality of scripture to religious knowledge. At the same time, he repeatedly dis- joins natural and moral or rational knowledge from salvific knowl- edge, as possessing distinct although compatible epistemologies. Hooker recognizes some necessary reciprocity between the autono- mous realms of natural, rational, and divine law (given their common author but differing purview). But he makes our perception of such reciprocity retroactive and conditional, succeeding the revelation of divine positive law in scripture and the operation of grace, without which faith would be humanly impossible. In short, he does not, as some have alleged, assign to reason the capacity to discern in the created world the means to salvation. On the contrary, he remarks in one place that the essential articles of Christianity defy all natural lines of inference.20 Reason's function is at best accessory to the dispensa- is See the Dublin fragments, where Hooker asserts that "God hath ordeyned grace, to counterveyle this our imbecillitie, and to serve as his hand, that thereby wee which cannot moove ourselves, may be drawne, butt amiablie drawne. If the grace of God did not enforce men to goodnes, nothing would bee more unpleasant unto man than vertue" ( The Works of Richard Hooker, Vol. 4, Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity: Attack and Response, ed. John E. Booty, Cambridge, Mass., 1982, p. 103). Herschel Baker's account of Hooker's rationalism neglects the conditional assistance of divine grace - a contingency which precludes the natural theology that Baker all but imputes to Hooker's argument, and necessarily qualifies the "continuity" Baker constructs between revelation and the "natural truths" of reason. As Hooker reminds his readers in the Dublin fragments, he is no Pelagian. See Baker, Wars of Truth, pp. 220-22. 20. For an example ot Hooker s clear restrictions on rational access to the means 01 salvation, see his definition of divine positive law (Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, 2 vols., London, 1907, I, 220).</page><page sequence="15">Victoria Silver 83 tion of grace, which alone discloses those propositions pertaining to salvation. So Hooker assigns reason a secondary, cooperative, and evidenti- ary role in religious knowledge, and from similar motives to those of Arminius. He conceives it as a sufficient if perplexed means by which to secure moral and institutional order in the church, an order which he too locates in the discriminative, methodical interpretation of scripture. Similarly, he restricts the text's self-evidence to those essen- tial propositions asserting our means of salvation - namely, to divine positive law. The purview of reason in the Laws is consequently discrete, contingent, and extensive: Hooker enlists human judgment in its own sphere, that of things voluntary and probable, which includes any evangelical or theological activity extrinsic to the text of scripture itself.21 He makes reason the arbiter of doctrine conceived as a species of religious opinion, premised on revelation but segregated from it by nature and definition. By this sceptical distribution of value and means in exegesis, Hooker shrewdly subverts the reformers' attempt to bypass and invalidate the exercise of human judgment in religious matters, exposing their necessary reliance on rational and prudential methods of suasion even as they arrogate to themselves a divine mandate: "Is not their surest ground most commonly, either some probable conjecture of their own, or the judgment of others taking those Scriptures as they do? Which not withstanding to mean otherwise than they take them, it is not still altogether impossible. So that now and then they ground themselves on human authority, even when they most pretend divine."22 So Hooker identifies irrationalism in the English "puritans" comparable to that of Arminius' opponents, insofar as both implicitly claim a new revelation - the knowledge of God's will supernaturally disclosed in scripture - which becomes their imperative and license. As a result, his defense of Anglican liturgy and episcopacy devolves upon an epistemology which at once enfranchises and confines human artifacts. Such an epistemology creates a realm of inquiry and practice for the church, eluding the 21. For Hooker's probabilism in exegesis and the promulgation of doctrine, see Laws, I, 267- 71. 22.

IV It is this plastic, informal doctrine which theologians such as John Hales (who attended the Synod of Dort), William Chillingworth and Jeremy Taylor prefer to the monologic dogma of Continental and, to a lesser extent, English high Calvinism. Rather than construct a systematic theology as Beza had, or attempt like Hooker to affirm the validity of an already-established doctrine, they sought to define the essential premises upon which the church and individual Christians might admit and practice a plurality of views, articulating a kind of theological method as against a positive doctrine.23 All three theolo- gians describe an experimental apparatus by which human reason - assisted by grace, with the precedent of tradition and probability as its criteria - tries the extent of its apprehension of scripture, so as to distinguish between certain and presumptive eductions from the text.24 As these theologians together ascribe fallibility to human in- ferences,25 and treat church doctrine as a various body of opinion, so they define dogma solely by its self-evidence: that is, the ease with which we may apprehend in faith a scriptural statement and so secure its meaning. By this means, they effectually restrict certitude and compulsion to the "plain places" of the text, from which we can extract only a few necessary truths. Yet even then, as John Hales observes, such passages "are very pregnant" and should not be pre- 23. See Hales' commendation of private inquiry, where he declares that "They that come and tell you what you are to believe, what you are to do, and tell you not why, they are not physicians, but leaches: and if you so take things at their hands, you do not like men, but like beasts" ( The Works . . . of John Hales, 3 vols., Glasgow, 1765, III, 150). 24. So Taylor in the Ductor Dubitantium argues that "in all this, here is no difference in my reason, save that as it does not prove a geometrical proposition by moral philosophy, so neither does it prove a revelation by a natural argument, but into one and the other it enters by principles proper to the inquisition; and faith and reasons are not opposed at all": "Faith and reason are several things, and arithmetical and moral reasons are as differing, but it is reason that carries me to objects of faith, and faith is my reason so disposed, so used, so instructed" ( The Works of Jeremy Taylor, Vols. 9-10, Ductor Dubitantium, ed. Alexander Taylor (1851), IX, 61). 25. Thus Chillingworth inveighs against "This presumptuous imposing of the senses of men upon the words of God, the speciali senses of men upon the generali words of God, and laying them upon mens consciences together, under the equall penaltie of death, and damnation" ( The Religion of Protestants A Safe Way to Salvation, Oxford, 1637; rpt. 1972, p. 198).</page><page sequence="17">Victoria Silver 85 emptorily constrained to a single literal sense.26 As for the ubiquitous "dark" or "hard places" in scripture, they resist our certain under- standing and must remain the subject of more or less probable conjec- ture by each reader,27 within which latitude the church may recom- mend or suspend judgment but certainly not prescribe. For all argue that dogmatic prescription when we can obtain no certain knowledge defies reason and charity, and what is worse, verges on a kind of alphabetical idolatry: "Again, Scripture is the voice of God: and it is confest by all, that the sense is Scripture, rather than the words. It cannot therefore be avoided, that he who wilfully strives to fasten some sense of his own upon it, other than the very nature of the place will bear, must needs take upon him the person of God, and become a new inditer of Scripture."28 In short, each theologian determines orthodoxy by the negative limits of human reason and scripture's intelligibility - our access to its "sense" as against the mere text, which must still be ratified by tradition and consensus. A sceptical exegesis effectively subverts the claims of private reve- lation in that it subjects all but a few human inferences from scripture to rational and consensual trial, as our single objective means of determining their legitimacy.29 Yet even the most probable argu- ments can impose no absolute constraint on believers; rather, they exert a judicial and provisional control over the institutional exercise of religion, reciprocally including interpretive practice. The liberal theology of Hales, Chillingworth and Taylor makes scriptural ex- egesis the core of Christian doctrine, but by contrast to many high Cal vinis ts, they assert its centrality specifically in order to restrict its 26. Hales, Works, II, 33-34. 27. In Taylor s words, we should follow "right reason proceeding upon the best grounds it can, viz. of divine revelation and humane authority, and probability is our guide, ( Stando in humanis) and supposing the assistance of Gods Spirit (which he never denies them that faile not of their duty in all such things in which he requires truth and certainty" (A Discourse of the Liberty of Prophesying, [1647]; rpt. 1971, pp. 170-71). "Probability" serves as their collective criterion in exegesis, and the instrument by which each seeks to constrain the imposition of dogma. See also Hales, Works, II, 95-96, and Chillingworth, Religion of Protestants, pp. 94-95. To exempt theology from proof and debate is to render it irrational, and as Hales states and they all recognized, to make it a force in the further fragmentation of the church. 28. Hales, Works, II, 27. 29. Hales' remark, that "It shall well befit our Christian modesty to participate somewhat of the Sceptic, and to use their withholding of judgment, till the remainder of our knowledge be supplied by Christ, " is exemplary of all three theologians in its distinction between faith and credulity, and its emphasis on the limited powers of human exegesis (Works, II, 44-45).</page><page sequence="18">86 English Literary Renaissance force. And this they achieve by simultaneously invoking and inhibit- ing the exercise of human reason in the manufacture of doctrine. So, on different occasions, Hales, Chillingworth, and Taylor each recom- mend an express scepticism with regard to the doctrine we educe from scripture: by confessing its own imperfect and approximate knowledge, theology must relinquish an absolute for a limited and necessarily liberal authority, reinforcing by example a suspension of judgment where opinion differs, and thus fostering charity in the practice of religion.30 V It is this sceptical, charitable theology that Browne embodies in the Religio Medici.31 The essay admits only a handful of necessary truths but professes a plethora of beliefs to which it assigns the status of mere opinion or pleasant speculation; it imports a host of abstruse and exotic corollaries to convey the tentative if wishful validity of any proposition; it favors paradoxes over syllogisms. In short, it neglects all pretense to certain knowledge of spiritual things while displaying a boundless enthusiasm for them. As Browne remarks elsewhere, " knowledge is made by oblivion; and to purchase a clear and warrantable body of Truth, we must forget and part with much we know ."32 He designs the Religio Medici to induce just such purposeful oblivion in the reader, and thereby to separate us from what we think we know about divinity. For by disclosing the incapacity of reason and discourse to secure any truth beyond the simple fact of salvation, Browne makes them equally the instruments of Christian charity. Accordingly, he equates lack of charity in religion with lack of reason, to the extent that when we constitute truth and impose it arbitrarily on others, we offend against both principles. Seen this way, enlisting reason in spiritual matters does not invite but rather inhibits human presump- tion by strictly circumscribing religious truth to the paucity of tenets which scripture plainly expounds, and which all Christians can dis- 30. By refusing to concede their limitations, theologians and lay readers alike promulgate error, prejudice and at the best, probabilities instead of truth, all of which feed sects and hasten the loss of a truly catholic church. For a version of this argument, see Chillingworth, Religion of Protestants, p. 180. 31. For Browne's express invocation of "points indifferent," see Religio, p. 62. 32. Browne, Works (Pseudodoxia), p. 165.</page><page sequence="19">Victoria Silver 87 cern and admit when assisted by grace. Such a rational faith requires Christians to exert both understanding and judgment, if only to discover that they can secure a credible doctrine but not a true one. So Browne blithely confesses himself indifferent to "those wingy myste- ries in Divinity, and ayery subtilties in Religion, which have unhing'd the braines of better heads" (p. 69). If he inquires into theology, he does so in order to promote his faith rather than advance his mastery of doctrine; and in this discrimination consists his notorious fondness for an " oh altitudo " (p. 69). He does not repudiate reason as such because it is reason that defines the nature and boundaries of belief. While that faculty may still obtrude between Browne and his "desire to exercise my faith in the difficultest point," nevertheless it cannot controvert Tertullian's dictum, Certum est quia impossible est (p. 70): reason can sufficiently discern the truth of essential doctrine, and even educe viable principles and syllogisms for theology, but it cannot transform its own arguments into certain proofs of the Trinity, much less resolve the endless ambiguities and profundities of scripture. So Browne brings his faith to surmount reason's obligatory impasse, remarking that "in these obscurities I rather use it, in the adjunct the Apostle gives it, a Buckler; under which I perceive a wary combatant may lie invulnerable" (p. 70). By this figure, Browne represents no implicit belief, but predicates the necessary yet imperfect role of reason in religion: he refuses to decide its superfluous dilemmas one way or another, choosing instead either to forego judgment and reside in uncertainty (p. 66), or self-consciously to endorse certain arguments without instituting them as dogmas (p. 62). Thus Browne observes that "Since I was of understanding to know we knew noth- ing, my reason hath beene more pliable to the will of faith; I am now content to understand a mystery without a rigid definition in an easie and Platonick description" (p. 70). This comment has a double reso- nance, because it follows immediately upon a cheerful enumeration of his own past heresies. As his lapses from orthodoxy are intended to suggest, our most partial reason can conjure up only imaginary en- tities and logical convolutions. So he states that "the wisest heads prove at last, almost all Scepticks, and stand like Janus in the field of knowledge": "for indeed heads of capacity, and such as are not full with a handfull, or easie measure of knowledg, thinke they know nothing, till they know all, which being impossible, they fall upon the opinion of Socrates , and onely know they know not any thing" (pp.</page><page sequence="20">88 English Literary Renaissance 147-48). Because human arguments are confined to probabilities, both they and the ideas they describe are mutable. In Browne's words, "wee doe but learne to day, what our better advanced judge- ments will unteach to morrow" (p. 147). And if we cannot secure our ideas, much less whole sectarian arguments constructed from them, neither intellectual manufacture should be made "a cause of disaffec- tion among us" (p. 138). So except where an argument expressly controverts the kerygma itself, Browne refuses to "perish upon a Ceremony, Politick point, or indifferency" (p. 95). It is precisely because humanity has propagated the most egregious fictions that it should not be allowed to prescribe what will or will not pass as truth. In the Pseudodoxia, which Browne devotes to the pan- oply of human misconception, he remarks that the majority of people "are but bad discerners of verity; and in the numerous track of error, but casually do hit the point and unity of truth."33 Most people, he argues, cannot discriminate between what is and what appears to be both with regard to words and ideas: "vulgar heads" enthusiastically credit the testimony of their senses, or adopt the literal sense of a text, and fiercely persist in such "sensible delusions" despite all attempts to disabuse them.34 But these intellectual aberrations only anticipate the fantastic errors of persons better informed: "as simple mistakes com- monly beget fallacies, so men rest not in false apprehensions, without absurd and inconsequent diductions; from fallacious foundations, and misapprehended mediums, erecting conclusions no way inferrible from their premises."35 And minds so desirous and adept at deducing absurdities are also apt to believe or disbelieve in extremes, neglecting inquiry, reason and method. Either they choose to "swallow falsities for truths, dubiosities for certainties, fesibilities for possibilities, and things impossible as possibilities themselves"; or they engage in "an obstinate incredulity, " ignoring even the most unexceptionable argu- ments.36 Given such abuses of reason, Browne's determination to exercise his faith cannot be impugned as irrational. With gentle if assiduous irony, he applies the machinery of logic to "Contempla- tions Metaphysicall, " the anomalies and conundrums of religion, the 33. Browne, Works (Pseudodoxia), p. 174. 34.

The much-vexed topic of God's nature compels him to declare: "I know he is wise in all, wonderfull in what we conceive, but far more in what we comprehend not, for we behold him but asquint upon reflex or shadow; our understanding is dimmer than Moses eye, we are ignorant of the backparts, or lower side of his Divinity; therefore to pry into the maze of his Counsels, is not onely folly in Man, but presumption even in Angels" (pp. 74-75). And we conceive scripture in a comparably perplexed and erratic manner: "It is impossible that either in the discourse of man, or in the infallible voyce of God, to the weakenesse of our apprehensions, there should not appeare irregularities, contradictions, and antinomies," some of which he has posed to himself at one time or other (pp. 87- 88). Some of these anomalies admit plausible resolution, with Browne even offering to explain on one occasion the metaphysical engineering by which both body and soul are resurrected (pp. 121-22). Yet in the same place he asserts that "many things are true in Divinity, which are neither inducible by reason, nor confirmable by sense, " and for which there are only ingenious and no satisfactory answers (p. 120), such as the question of Lazarus' legal claim to his estate, or Adam's putative hermaphroditism (p. 88). Finally, he takes issue with the method of exegesis itself. On dif- ferent occasions, he disputes the literal interpretation of creation (p. 104), the Eucharist (p. 95), of judgment (p. 117), of heaven and hell (pp. 122-25), to emphasize the vagaries which attend our ideas of the things scripture represents. To that end, he introduces the familiar doctrine of accommodation, "for unspeakable mysteries in the Scrip- tures are often delivered in a vulgar and illustrative way, and being written unto man, are delivered, not as they truely are, but as they may bee understood" (p. 117). Although scripture may itself invite a literal reading, Browne regards that practice as but one more example of human presumption in divine matters. As we try scripture by the standard of human authority and precedent, impose doctrine upon it to gratify our desire for certainty, and credit our own inventions with divine warranty, so we coerce God's word into conformity with human ideas. In the Pseudodoxia , Browne complains that most people not only require such "visible inducements" as apologues, parables, proverbs and exempla to understand an argument, but that they also</page><page sequence="22">90 English Literary Renaissance reduce any subtle and complex operation to its most obvious ef- fects.37 As a case in point, he cites the scriptures where literal readings of the text have fostered a plethora of heresies by emphasizing the immediate, simple sense of the words. But this species of material- ism, for that is what Browne deplores, does not stop with a single heresy but proceeds to remake God and the things of religion in its own image. Because some readers cannot grasp the "second inten- tion" or abstract reference within scriptural figures, they neglect all those verbal signals which indicate and sustain the figurative activity of a passage or phrase - its "superconsequencies, coherencies, fig- ures, or tropologies."38 But what is worse, "to humour the grosse- nesse of their comprehensions," literal exegetes crudely translate spir- itual entities into what Browne calls "manuali" or anthropomorphic terms.39 Ignoring the figuration or ambiguity of the text, while sub- stituting a simplistic or formulaic mode of signification in its place, is not solely the penchant of the vulgar but obtains equally among educated readers. "From this fallacy arose the calamitous error of the Jews, misapprehending the Prophesies of their Messias, and ex- pounding them alwaies unto literall and temporali expectations," as well as the misinterpretations placed on Pythagoras' philosophy, "converting Metaphors into proprieties, and receiving as literrall ex- pressions, obscure and involved truths."40 Moreover, this proclivity to "conclude from the sign unto the thing signified" becomes the mechanism of idolatry, "men converting the symbolical use of Idols into their proper Worship, and receiving the representation of things as the substance and thing it self."41 In the same vein, Browne ana- tomizes the transubstantiation of the Eucharist, "the Bread and Wine which were but the signals or visible signs, were made the thing signified, and worshipped as the Body of Christ."42 His desire here in 37.

Like Browne, Hales is no literalist, and his interpretation of Christ's words in instituting the Eucharist exemplify that point: he rejects the Catholic argument, which construes them literally, and one Protestant version (possibly Luther's), which also imposes a certain spiritual reality upon the statements "this is my body" and "this is my blood." To Hales, Christ's words simply describe his historical actions at the meal, and constitute a figurative expression or "metaphor," extrinsic to the sacrament itself. He concludes that the Eucharist serves two purposes, commemoration and</page><page sequence="23">Victoria Silver 91 the Religio is to underscore the extent to which we bend and distort the scriptural text to support material and topical ideas, both in order to relieve our fear of what we do not know, and to prescribe our opinions. Consequently, he would prefer that all such "conclusions, and fallible discourses of man upon the word of God" be reviewed at a general synod, and then, with the exception of a "few and solid Authors," consigned to the flames (pp. 91-92). VI But Browne construes not one but "two books from whence I collect my Divinity; besides that written one of God, another of his servant Nature, that universali and publik Manuscript, that lies expans'd unto the eyes of all" (p. 78). If he denies human efficacy in deciphering scripture, much less our capacity to penetrate the metaphysical realm, he nevertheless invokes reason when expatiating on the divinity of creation itself. By our "intellectual discernments," we perceive "things invisible," and disclose in natural phenomena the principles and attributes of their supernatural author.43 So Browne acknowl- edges that "my humbler speculations have another Method, and are content to trace and discover those expressions hee hath left in his creatures, and the obvious effects of nature" - an inquiry which he authorizes as "the debt of our reason wee owe unto God" (p. 75). To the extent that reason's proper sphere consists in this "devout and learned admiration" of God's artifacts, so it also lies in refuting those who, because they cannot observe his immediate, sensible presence, not only discount his oblique agency in ordering and animating cre- ation, but repudiate him altogether (p. 75). The same materialism that adores the letter of scripture likewise predicates a world composed exclusively of perceptible forces and entities. Against this hypostasis of what he terms the "foure second causes of all things," Browne postulates a fluid, indefinite agency in nature which is God (p. 76). Thus he argues that God created and informs two worlds, or rather, two dimensions of a single, unified cosmos, so that "though there bee but one to sense, there are two to reason; the one visible, the other fellowship, and ends his commentary with the injunction, Quicquid ultra quaeritur, non intel- ligitur - whatever more is sought, is not discernible in the text (Hales, Works, I, 61-63). 43. Browne, Works (Pseudodoxia), p. 175.</page><page sequence="24">92 English Literary Renaissance invisible," each articulating the same agency and authority (pp. 104- 05). Things metaphysical constitute the actuality of "what we are but in hopes, and probabilitie" (p. 103). Unfortunately, we restrict the scope and nature of the world to a sensory reality, and so ascribe causation merely to the perceptible effects of God. And as we admit the existence of only those causes, entities, and attributes which are discernible by sense, so we banish God from his own creation. But to delimit God's presence in phenomena in this way, Browne argues, is not only to impoverish reality but to misunderstand it. Analogously, one cannot persuade a person with arguments to believe in the opera- tion of magnetic north, yet physical demonstration proves it beyond question (p. 120). God's agency within things is another such imper- ceptible force, to which natural order itself testifies. Browne sees the phenomenal world as the diverse and flexible medium through which God variously articulates his being, and which consequently serves as a source of knowledge about the divine nature comparable to scrip- ture, both in its authority and its figurative, mediated witness (pp. 78- 79). So, echoing Isaiah, he proceeds to collapse the distinction be- tween primary and secondary causes to make this polemical point: "I call the effects of nature the works of God, whose hand &amp; instrument she only is; and therefore to ascribe his actions unto her, is to devolve the honor of the principali agent, upon the instrument; which if with reason we may doe, then let our hammers rise up and boast they have built our houses, and our pens receive the honour of our writings" (p. 80). Brunonian philosophy does not consist in relegating cause to the collation of perceptible phenomena; instead, it requires that we should investigate the apparatus of things for signs of a hidden, originary nature. And Browne believes the divine is always potentially insur- gent in phenomena: those persons who profess to believe in God and ascribe creation to him, and yet who demand he observe their axioms and expectations, effectively reduce divinity to natural law, subjecting God to the determinations of human reason. Browne confounds this mechanistic view by refusing to affirm the cessation of miracles, because he will not disallow God's invention or initiative in reanimat- ing his artifact, or submerge the alien in the familiar and mundane. He observes that "Wee doe too narrowly define the power of God, restraining it to our capacities" (p. 95). Since we cannot ourselves discover, or for that matter anticipate and master, the imperatives</page><page sequence="25">Victoria Silver 93 which motivate nature, to delimit the agency that fomented phe- nomena in the first place is a remarkable display of presumption. By extracting God and immaterial being from the world, we also miscon- ceive the office of human reason, which is to disclose and expound a different, practical divinity, not leaving creation "as though it had not been, or as it was before the sixt day when as yet there was not a creature that could conceive, or say there was a world" (p. 75). Yet human conception, to the extent that it can even reproduce the sensible character of things, fragments and obscures the very supernal coherence reason should disclose. So Browne devotes the Religio to pursuing "the ubiquitary, and omnipresent essence of God": "doe but extract from the corpulency of bodies, or resolve things beyond their first matter, and you discover the habitation of Angels" (p. 104). If he waxes rhapsodic on that "common Spirit that playes within us, yet makes no part of us, and that is the Spirit of God," it is to affirm the divinity immanent in this existence, not restricted to some altogether remote and inapprehensible world (pp. 99-100). Seen in this way, natural philosophy engages in a more salutary kind of theology than extrapolations from scripture. Where scripture defies inference by its ambiguous and oblique revelation, the natural world offers a residual yet nonetheless intelligible expression of God's being which reason, rightly framed, can educe. So Browne declares that "in this masse of nature there is a set of things that carry in their front, though not in capitali letters, yet in stenography, and short Characters, something of Divinitie, which to wiser reasons serve as Luminaries in the abysse of knowledge, and to judicious beliefes, as scales and roundles to mount the pinnacles and highest pieces of Divinity" (pp. 73-74). Yet despite the ready access extended by God to this considerable knowl- edge, humanity refuses to seek it out. So the text which had taught pagans to know God, remains unread by precisely those who struggle to infer the same knowledge from the impenetrable and perhaps improper resources of scripture (p. 79). Browne argues that although both creation and scripture originate with God, we prefer that revela- tion and discourse that accord, in appearance if not in fact, with our own assumptions. We abuse both modes of divine self-representation in the same fashion, by ascribing significance only to the recognizable features of each, and conflating God with the intellectual or material media through which he manifests himself. If we experience phe- nomena as opaque and insignificant, it is because we perceive only</page><page sequence="26">94 English Literary Renaissance their difference from ourselves or from our ideas. To scripture, on the other hand, we assign untenable transparency of meaning because it employs our own language, apparently conforming to our ideas of things. But Browne believes nature retains a more forcible if not more assured mode of signification: "The finger of God hath left an inscrip- tion upon all his workes, not graphicall or composed of Letters, but of their severall formes, constitutions, parts, and operations, which apt- ly joy ned together doe make one work that doth expresse their na- tures" (p. 136). Creation is as much God's discourse as scripture, and describes his ideas with a propriety to which human language cannot attain, because natural phenomena observe a congenital decorum as against the imputed, secondary coherence upon which human intel- lection insists. Words not only replicate the false categories and dis- tinctions which reason concocts, but the discrete, material world lan- guage represents - the automorphic world of the mind - disfigures the actual and evident identity of things that a transformed perception may see. As Browne declares: "wee Christen effects by their most sensible and nearest causes, yet is God the true and infallible cause of all, whose concourse though it be generali, yet doth it subdivide it selfe into the particular actions of every thing, and is that spirit, by which each singular essence not onely subsists, but performes its operations" (p. 84). VII Whether in theology or natural philosophy, language, like the mind that invented it, more usually deforms than captures the shape of things. Indeed, to the extent that words institute and parade our ideas, they simply aggravate our intellectual failings. How "many thousand severall words," he exclaims at one point, "have been carelesly and without study composed of 24. Letters" (p. 136), words like "for- tune," which he specifically attributes to "the ignorance of mans reason" that "by a carelesse terme miscalled the providence of God" (p. 83). As we spew out words, so we hastily fabricate ideas; neglect- ing adequate inquiry into the nature and principals of each thing we name and thus appropriate as known, human argument inevitably devolves upon "a naked asseveration: wherein neither declaring the causes, affections or adjuncts of what we beleeve, it carrieth not with</page><page sequence="27">Victoria Silver 95 it the reasonable inducements of knowledge."44 In the Pseudodoxia, Browne accordingly deprecates the value of citation and arguments from authority, because these are no more than "bare and peremptory asseverations" that abuse the inevitably alien and elusive character of truth. Not only our inferences, but equally our mode of signifying them in discourse fail to capture the certain knowledge we desire, for others or ourselves. The antics of human intellection and language tempt Browne to the same solution John Hales recommends, a sus- pension of judgment (p. 148). But his scepticism neither cultivates an aporia nor lends itself resistlessly to such a suspension: instead he consigns all rational artifacts - ideas, words, and the institutions they construct - to the qualified dimension of the merely probable. In the Religio , he grants the discourses of theologians no more credence or value than he extends to the arguments of Epicurus, the Stoics, Aristotle or Hermes Trismegistus, because each describes in some degree the character of the world as Browne conceives it. Human knowledge as a whole becomes a repertoire of probable discourses, which he appropriates both to reinforce his own arguments and to supply the reader with varied and provocative figures that articu- late - by virtue of Browne's irony - the lambent world they other- wise obscure. As a result, the sheer abundance of allusion, citation, image, and system he incorporates into his text enacts his uncertain knowledge and our own; so that the Religions method of argument, although not the argument itself, simulates the reader's and invet- erately egoistic conception of experience. In Christian Morals , Browne gives an epitome of this sceptical diffidence of argument, noting that "a Man may come unto the Pericardium , but not the Heart of Truth"; "Many things are known, as some are seen, that is by Parallaxis, or at some distance from their true and proper beings, the superficial re- gard of things having a different aspect from their true and central Natures"; and this recognition "moves sober Pens unto suspensory and timorous assertions, nor presently to obtrude them as Sibyls leaves, which after considerations may find to be but folious appar- ences, and not the central and vital interiours of Truth."45 So, when confronted with the enigmatic account of creation and the fall in 44. Browne, Works (Pseudodoxia), p. 191. 45. Browne, Works (Christian Morals), p. 438.</page><page sequence="28">9 6 English Literary Renaissance Genesis, Browne concludes that "though Divines have to the power of humane reason endeavoured to make all goe in a literall meaning, yet those allegorical interpretations are also probable, and perhaps the mysticall method of Moses bred up in the Hieroglyphicall Schooles of the Egyptians" (p. 104). He prefers a figurai reading for the same reason that he converts a literal argument into a kind of allegory: figurai exegesis, like tropes themselves, displaces and circumscribes the force of its own propositions. Just as Browne claims to gather his doctrine from "Those strange and mysticall transmigrations that I have observed in Silke wormes" (p. no), so he locates validity in a metaphor (p. 103) or paradox (p. 126), and resorts to several different idioms, speaking occasionally like a philosopher (p. 121), and once even as a politician (p. 134). He emulates the actual alienation between our ideas and the reality they putatively describe, by eschewing literal or positive arguments in favor of what he in one place terms the "Histrionicar mode of signification - discourse that frankly and de- lightedly impersonates rational argument, and thus challenges the reader's relentless identification of textual with providential design.46 In the preface to the Religio Medici , Browne appears to temporize about the argument and manner of his essay, remarking that it con- veys "the sense of my conceptions at that time, not an immutable law unto my advancing judgement at all times," and moreover, that "There are many things delivered Rhetorically, many expressions therein meerely Tropicali, and as they best illustrate my intention; and therefore also there are many things to be taken in a soft and flexible sense, and not to be called unto the rigid test of reason" (p. 60). However conventional his disclaimer, it is this "soft and flexible sense" that gives Browne's prose its distinctive rhetoricity. As the essay delivers his professedly mutable opinions, so his mode of dis- course observes their contingent value with language suitably elastic and provisional in its formulations. His prefatory remarks are not so much formal as procedural and exemplary, because any argument, and especially one about religion, should confess the limits of its validity lest it too becomes implicated in the reader's credulity. The Religio operates as a kind of inverse polemic: it does not presume to certain truth, and so allows no literal readings of scripture to pass without irony (not infrequently performed by Browne upon his own 46. Browne, Works (Christian Morals), p. 463.</page><page sequence="29">Victoria Silver 97 beliefs), expounds no positive doctrine, slanders and condemns no one with the exception of those "vulgar heads" who serve as easy surrogates for us all and of course refrains from making "bare and peremptory asseverations." Instead, the text renders Browne's ideas for what they are, more or less probable opinion, which requires a contingent and indeed nominal statement that frankly admits its ac- tual, attenuated force. As Browne prefers to apprehend his faith by figures rather than by definitions, so he represents them by the same means. For the Religio not only proves but elaborates his claim that "where I cannot satisfie my reason, I love to humour my fancy": I had as leive you tell me that anima est angelus hominis , est Corpus Dei , as Entelechia ; Lux est umbra Dei , as actus perspicui: where there is an obscurity too deepe for our reason, 'tis good to set downe with a description, periphrasis, or adumbration; for by acquainting our reason how unable it is to display the visible and obvious effect of nature, it becomes more humble and submissive unto the subtilties of faith: and thus I teach my haggard and unreclaimed reason to stoope unto the lure of faith (p. 71). He sets out to teach the same truth to equally unreclaimed readers, two of whom - Coleridge and Stanley Fish - can make no sense of the following passage: That there is but one world, is a conclusion of faith. Aristotle with all his Philosophy hath not beene able to prove it, and as weakely that the world was eternali; that dispute much troubled the penne of the antient Philoso- phers, but Moses decided that question, and all is salved with the new terme of a creation, that is, a production of something out of nothing; and what is that? Whatsoever is opposite to something or more exactly, that which is truely contrary unto God: for he onely is, all others have existence, with dependency and are something but by a distinction; and herein is Divinity conformant unto Philosophy, and generation not onely founded on con- trarieties, but also creation; God being all things is contrary unto nothing out of which were made all things, and so nothing became something, and Omneity informed Nullity into an essence, (p. 105) In his marginalia, Coleridge comments, "An excellent Burlesque on some parts of the Schoolmen, tho' I fear an unintentional one,"47 while Fish concludes that "The only possible response to this bastard 47.

Patrides supplies Coleridge's remark in his commentary (p. iosn).</page><page sequence="30">98 English Literary Renaissance scholasticism is laughter."48 And to some extent they are both right, for this passage does not acknowledge the mode of signification that for opposite reasons both assume it should: namely, as signifying the discrete, perceptual entities of a phenomenal world. But to Browne, neither do the onomastic terms of scholastic logic which he treats accordingly, composing them into a kind of allegorical equation that analyzes the initial verses of Genesis. This equation signifies some- thing, but after a method peculiar to Browne in the Religio Medici, for which it simultaneously provides an axiom and epitome. The crux of the passage lies in his statement that "[God] onely is, all others have existence, with dependency and are something but by a distinction." In effect, Browne names the final referent for the essay's discourse, an ubiquitous God whose informing presence belies the putative dis- criminations of language. But where Fish insists that a comparable "reality" and referent in the texts of Donne or Milton demand the express enactment of linguistic collapse and intellectual abasement, he disdains Browne's enthusiastic non-sense because it does not repudi- ate but rather relishes its own specious formulations, thus earning the (to Fish) opprobrium of "rhetoric." But the subversion of language, not to mention sceptical integrity, can assume more than one discur- sive strategy and make more than one exhortation. Like Donne and Milton, Browne believes that God exists within his own creation, but unlike them, he grants that creation no ultimately separable form or being apart from God: "For before the creation of the world God was really all things" (p. 104). So Fish properly defines "distinction" here as a "linguistic and perceptual distortion," although he duly denies that Browne either understands the implication of his own words, or desires the reader to do so.49 Yet Browne devotes the Religio precisely to the causes and deleterious effects of human distinctions, that nega- tive artifact of reason which here possesses the unexceptionable sense of "difference" - an attribute not of things but of ideas, without extension but nonetheless actual inasmuch as it derives from the correlating procedure of reason among its conceptions. "Distinction" is, in short, a term by which we designate certain mental phenomena which do not necessarily correspond to or inhere in a world of ob- jects. We distinguish one idea or sign from another, and articulate 48. Fish, Self-Consuming Artifacts, p. 355. 49. Fish, Self Consuming Artifacts, p. 355.</page><page sequence="31">Victoria Silver 99 those distinctions by means of other ideas and signs; but that is not to claim that such differences exist independently of intellection or dis- course. For Browne as for Delacroix, "language does not photograph things, it constitutes them";50 but since God may yet effect an insur- gence against all rational glosses on himself and creation, thus pre- cluding a closed textual "reality" for the Religio , Browne's distinc- tions do not invite the infinite regress of Derridean differance. And if he does not abstain from language by observing the single order and consequence of distinction Fish admits, that is because Browne treats rhetoricity itself more capaciously, as an arena of symbolic action. To the mind which faith has not transformed, things possess dis- tinction: there are different objects, persons, nations, and more to the point, different sects and creeds. Browne argues conversely that these distinctions have no correlative in some discrete, segmented world, that they and the words signifying them begin and end as mental figments; "God being all things," creation instead manifests the im- manence, goodness and productive desire of divinity. Accordingly, in the Religio Medici, linguistic usage involves a symbolic coordination of faith and sectarian politics in equally nominal modes of statement: on the one hand, presumptively literal usage which makes the world commensurate with the fantasies of human intellection, and on the other, tropological usage which abundantly imagines the divine with- out predicating any identity between "real" things and its figures (embracing everything from received systems of knowledge to sim- ple signs). Thus throughout the Religio , Browne may be said to observe a loose nominalism in his usage and in his meditations on discourse more generally. Human signs represent human ideas, and these are very often wrong, distracted by the mere surfaces of sense perception or perverted by a self-aggrandizing reason. Because they do not describe the actual shape and coherence of creation, at least in the speculative form Browne conceives for it, words address imposed distinctions and can refer only to other words with which they share the same strangely obtuse and prejudicial activity. We then distinguish more among words than among things, because discourse, by its incessant resolution of things into mental and verbal elements, re- 50. Richard Lanham, The Motives of Eloquence: Literary Rhetoric in the Renaissance (New Haven, Conn., 1976), p. 21.</page><page sequence="32">ioo English Literary Renaissance mains oblivious to the contingent yet actual unity between creation and creator. To use his own contemporary phrase and criterion, Browne designates all language as terms of "the second intention" - notions formulated by reason with no automatic or necessary exis- tence outside the mind, like the analytical language of scholasticism he abuses above. By contrast, literal exegetes and the species of materialist he describes, conceive all words to be of the first intention, as directly and absolutely signifying real things and their nature. But Browne more or less disavows the possibility of a pure and efficacious denotative language, for we cannot practicably observe God's imme- diate unity with creation, only infer it as something present imag- inatively through faith. Just as some arguments may be logical but not true if one refers them to experience for confirmation, so in the Religio Medici, where discourse undertakes to evoke the preternatural affinity of nature to God, any argument or statement is valid insofar as it artic- ulates that affinity. The affinity itself is not a visionary idea: it is a pal- pable, scientific one that depends not only on rational inquiry but on the reformation of reason's prime instrument, discourse. Reason can be taught to construe experience in such a way that it discloses the re- lation between God and things - as Browne himself demonstrates - but a segmented, prejudicial language by its very nature resists any such disclosure. Therefore, Browne exerts a kind of rational violence upon signification: because they possess no other reference, words may be yoked together at will so long as their construction is consis- tent with their nominal value. Both Browne's statements and proofs are accordingly "figurative" even when they appear to be "literal" since discourse has the task of representing the "ubiquitary, and omni- present essence of God, " which it can only do indirectly or, as he puts it, by parallaxis. If one isolates but does not "refer" the meaning of each word in Browne's pseudoscholastic syllogism, its argument sug- gests an internal if altogether nominal method, hinging on Browne's "new terme of a creation" - "a production of something out of noth- ing." If we designate the God of Genesis as something with existence or being, and all other things in their scriptural opposition as nothing, then when God made all things now having being or existence out of his opposite, God made a production out of contraries; and "Om- neity" or "allness" did indeed create being or existence out of "Nullity" or "nothingness." The passage's assorted names have a logical relation to one another, affirmed by synonymy and repetition, but its analyt-</page><page sequence="33">Victoria Silver IO I ical value is confined to the thematic nexus between the two texts and relinquishes all other semantic force, especially in the world beyond ideas and signs. Words here function like semiotic building blocks, fitted together contingently and according to their nominal com- patibility as signs, in a kind of syntactical accretion that respects only the idea of unity Browne promotes. If one looks for more than verbal physics, then his "new terme of a creation" does indeed amount to mere words; if one acknowledges a further symbolic dimension to usage, then it becomes his profession of faith in a unitary world paradoxically mediated by the false distinctions of human language. So both Fish and Coleridge are right to recognize the sheer nomi- nally of Browne's syllogism. But it is deliberate, not inadvertent or duplicitous, and emblematic of the essay's larger argument: that the only truths of which we stand assured are the fundamental articles of faith; that every other argument enunciates the fallible and disfiguring perception of "literal" usage; that such usage defies rational as against divine or natural relations and categories; and consequently that we can presume for any discourse only a contingent, figurai correspon- dence to "reality." And to Browne there is no reality except the imma- nence of God in creation, and so, by that one great criterion, his syllo- gism becomes as viable as any other, perhaps more so because it at least attempts to subvert the fallacy of literalism, or first-intention terms. His immediate referent is Fish's ineffable subject, which Browne nevertheless undertakes to evoke by a plethora of verbal fictions, seeking to reconstitute the reader's perception by transposing lan- guage's distinctions to a symbolic plane, where they are made to enact an antithetical truth and to exorcise their own truth-claims. VIII The Religio' s rhetoricity has two purposes then: first, it negatively signals the tenuous connection between discourse, as the formal artic- ulation of human ideas, and the world it purports to describe; second, since it eschews "the rigid test of reason," the essay's largely tro- pologica! usage enables Browne to suggest however obliquely or flamboyantly the quality of the world language in fact deforms. As he undermines the reader's confidence in terms, doctrines, philosophies, and creeds, so he simultaneously advances an alternate and figurai way of seeing which collapses precisely those distinctions upon which</page><page sequence="34">102 English Literary Renaissance humanity erects and justifies its opinions. In the place of a specious literalism, he substitutes metaphor, paradox, analogy, similitude, and the newly figurative arguments of both received and marginal sci- ences, which together work to summon up those elliptical verities which reason and faith together discern in experience. In fashion- ing the Religio' s intricate if seemingly random pattern of tropes and schemes, Browne seeks to disabuse humanity of its great vulgar fiction - that we can apprehend and articulate the "real" nature of things - and prepare his readers for a novel and more charitable con- ception of human and natural diversity. When axioms are given only symbolic force, and terms are made figures, then we dissolve those false, artificial barriers to religious communion, defusing sectarian antipathies by removing their ostensible grounds of "distinction." Again and again the Religio' s figuration enacts the latent unity of creation in God, making absurd the "divided and distinguished worlds" which we construct and embody in discourse. This thesis also conduces to a subtly contingent syntax of argument, which turns on the almost-inconsequential associations different words or subjects excite in Browne, moving the reader in one instance from the idea of charity to that of natural morality, to the difference between philan- thropy motivated by reason or faith, to the insufficiency of pity and the rhetoric that exploits it, to those who can gauge their words to suit their victim and can judge a person's heart by her or his face (p. 135). From the subject of physiognomy as signification, he shifts to the signifying modes of the natural world, to plants, vegetables, Adamie naming, palmistry, and so forth, until he arrives at the indicative problem of "real" versus rational similitude and diversity, which further separates the image of God in humanity from its original (pp. 1 3 5-3 6). In a single section of such discursive accidents, he has cumu- latively represented the discrepancy between rational hermeneutics and divine codes, echoing (to the point of appropriation) a similar statement in Montaigne and as such doubly reiterating the problem of human intellection - "thus is Man like God, for in the same things that wee resemble him, wee are utterly different from him" (p. 137). Each argumentative maneuver hinges on the idea or term imme- diately preceding, which it envelopes only to precipitate another, haphazardly enumerating examples which appear incidentally to ar- ticulate and affirm Browne's thesis. By this sceptical expatiation of related ideas, he can argue a case without rendering it formal and so</page><page sequence="35">Victoria Silver 1 03 conclusive to the reader, who is unduly responsive to the ritual of logical demonstration. So Browne devises a sort of paraphrasis or circumlocution for his statements which represents their nominality. But the Religio9 s similitudes and paradoxes comprise the most infamous of Browne's rhetorical devices, especially when he com- bines them into a single trope, as he does here: Now for these wals of flesh, wherein the soule doth seeme to be immured before the Resurrection, it is nothing but an elementall composition, and a fabricke that must fall to ashes; All flesh is grasse, is not onely metaphorically, but literally true, for all those creatures we behold, are but the hearbs of the field, digested into flesh in them, or more remotely carnified in our selves. Nay further, we are what we all abhorre, Antropophagi and Cannibals, devourers not onely of men, but of our selves; and that not in an allegory, but a positive truth; for all this masse of flesh which wee behold, came in at our mouths; this frame wee looke upon, hath beene upon our trenchers; In briefe, we have devoured our selves, (p. 107) This similitude contains three interlocking analogies which elaborate Browne's understanding of flesh as an "elementall composition." Again, the "literal" and "positive" truth that he claims for each com- parison ironically necessitates a kind of semantic diffusion, contraven- ing the strict, discrete and literal usage of the word and the distinction it embodies, as against Browne's innovative mode of signification. In the first place, almost without exception, he construes and disposes his words tropologically. By uniting "digest" with the preposition "into," he converts the precise sense of the verb into something more lax and ample, along the lines of "change" or "transmute," while yet retaining its scientific connotation. Indeed, by admitting the initial comparison of "flesh" to "wals" or an unspecified "fabricke" in which the soul is confined - a metaphor effectively concealed by the abstract and Latinate character of Browne's diction - we are prepared to meet the even greater semantic demands of his succeeding comparisons. For the "truth" which attends each statement and the similitude as a whole is neither literal nor positive but figurai: we no more consume human flesh than animals constitute herbs. Browne contracts the sequence of consumption and growth in order to create a nominal identity between the body and its nourishment, sufficient to sustain his final assertion that "we have devoured our selves." Thus he evisce- rates the specific sense of "elementall, " "composition," "fabricke,"</page><page sequence="36">I04 English Literary Renaissance "digest," "carnify," and "devour" to fashion a new sequence or con- figuration between grasse , creature , men and Cannibals (anthropopha- gus, literally "man-eater"), which utterly ignores the material referent of each word. The reality all three propositions are designed to elucidate does not belong to the perceptual accidents of intellection, or even to natural distinctions: rather, it participates in the "rule of order" God sustains in creation, as the phrase from Isaiah anticipates. The tropes, includ- ing the similitude's focal paradox, derive their novel force from our inveterately discrete, categorical apprehension of the world, an ap- prehension each figure courts and then subverts to achieve the general overthrow of such assumptions. They could be said to exercise the reader in "real" discriminations, by which we are instructed in divine as against human categories. But Browne also exploits the negative or critical implications of his figures, in that they ironically delineate the arbitrary and apparent in human distinctions by their own fantas- tic activity and claims. " Before Abraham was , I am, is the saying of Christ," he declares, "yet is it true in some sense if I say it of my selfe, for I was not onely before my selfe, but Adam , that is, in the Idea of God, and the decree of that Synod held from all Eternity"; so that "in this sense, I say, the world was before the Creation, and at an end before it had a beginning; and thus was I dead before I was alive, though my grave be England , my dying place was Paradise, and Eve miscarried of mee before she conceiv'd of Cain " (p. 132). Where he might have read that statement more or less literally, as signifying an earlier, historical incarnation of God's son, Browne instead construes it as a figure indicating the myopic and material conception we have of time. He applies the terms of Christ's assertion to himself, who like all created things first exists in the mind of God and so vicariously participates in eternity, which of course knows no temporal distinc- tions. Relative to divine conception and the single, continuous pres- ent of eternity, earthly events occur simultaneously, not sequentially, from which speculative position Browne can argue first, that sin and judgment are at once contemporary and yet precedent to the historical world; and second, that his metaphysical being anticipates his histor- ical existence. By making eternity his point of reference, he subsumes all objects and relations under the genetic principle of their identity in God, which at once obliterates their historical and phenomenal dis- creteness just as it wreaks havoc with grammatical tense.</page><page sequence="37">Victoria Silver 105 Given the nominality this ultimate referent persistently confers on language, Browne feels free to transform its elements and conven- tions into a theater where linguistic usage symbolically enacts the religious and political conflict of his age. Understood in this way, the Religio Medici operates as a theological allegory, employing as its vehicle not narrative or dramatic conventions, but the tropisms of human intellection and discourse, which Browne at once exploits and criticizes. Against such tropisms as rational automorphia or literal exegesis, Browne sets his distinctive rhetoricity, from which we can infer the actuality obscured by human misreadings of things phe- nomenal and revealed. Verbal contrivance and excess do not neces- sarily indicate a disregard for sense or the reader's improvement: it can express scepticism about received categories of value and how we determine and propagate them. Thus Browne concludes that "there is no felicity in that the world adores": " Aristotle whilst hee labours to refute the Idea's of Plato , fais upon one himselfe: for his summum bonum, is a Chimera , and there is no such thing as his Felicity" (p. 160). Instead, "That wherein God himselfe is happy, the holy Angels are happy, in whose defect the Devils are unhappy; that dare I call hap- pinesse: whatsoever conduceth unto this, may with an easie Metaphor deserve that name; whatsoever else the world termes happines, is to me a story out of Pliny, an apparition, or neat delusion, wherein there is no more of happinesse than the name" (p. 160).
