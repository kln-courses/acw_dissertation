<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-THE ENIGMA OF HUME. BY ERNEST C. MOSSNER. THE challenge of Hume's maturest and best written work, the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, has seldom been com- pletely ignored by even the most cursory reader. But attempts at exegesis have hitherto been thwarted by the antecedent question of the identity of the three interlocutors. Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo present a problem which in itself has fas- cinated thoughtful readers from the time of the posthumous publication of the Dialogues in 1779 down to the present day. Many have been the conjectures, but seldom has any attempt been made at substantiation. The obvious inference that the sceptic Philo is Hume himself, pious thinkers have ever been reluctant to face. But the justice of this identification has recently been placed beyond all reasonable doubt by the cogent evidence assembled by Professor Norman Kemp Smith in the excellent introduction to his edition of the Dialogues for the Clarendon Press. There is no need to enumerate here PrQfessor Smith's arguments; his general contention "that Philo, from start to finish, represents Hume," may be accepted unquestioned. But his inadvertent admission in passing that " something of Hume's " own beliefs " has been " put into the mouths " of both Demea and Cleanthes unfortunately confuses further investigation into the identity of those two characters.2 That Demea and Cleanthes at times voice opinions that Hume himself would subscribe to is indubitable but beside the point. Though the three protagonists may actually hold a few incon- sequentials in common, and though they may even be somewhat inconsistent, they are nevertheless three in number precisely because Hume wished to present three distinct opinions concern- ing Natural Religion.

Two of these viewpoints are theistic; the third is sceptical, for Professor Smith has made perfectly clear that Philo's occasional gestures toward faith in " revela- tion " are at best but conventional in a work of which the author himself boasted "that nothing can be more cautiously and more artfully written." 2 If Hume assuredly is the sceptic, the two theists still remain unknown. It is, of course, not impossible that Demea and. Cleanthes meant to Hume no more than two typical theistic systems; yet psychologically it seems much more likely that he fancied himself as arguing personally with two real divines. Moreover Hume's acknowledged reaction to his up- bringing and early religious training would insure the two divines' being British rather than Scottish. Certainly neither one exhibits the slightest tendency towards Calvinism. The probable pro- totypes that conditioned Hume's thinking during the composition of the Dialogues are therefore to be found in an historical review of the contemporary religious situation in England. In the first half of the eighteenth century two schools of re- ligious thought flourished in the Anglican Church, the dogmatic a priori group modifying the philosophical systems of Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz and finding its spokesman in Samuel Clarke, and the more recent a posteriori group evolving a religious philo- sophy from the grotmdwork of John Locke and best represented bv Joseph Butler. The first group tended to be " Low Church" in doctrine, the second " High Church." Both groups had been influenced by the New Science, especially as directed by Isaac Newton, but the first group was most impressed by Newton's mathematics, the second by his empiricism. Among important intellectual leaders the latter group was slowly gaining a mastery over the former. By 1750 the victory was virtually complete. In the second half of the century this dominance resulted in the formation of the narrowly empirical school of theology headed by William Paley at Cambridge University. Yet empirical theology until well into the nineteenth century never distinctively affected the inert mass of Church underlings, who continued to retain much of Clarke's dogmatic attitude. Clarke and Butler were thus the most ready theologians for Hume to cast in the roles of Demea and Cleanthes, not only because of their actual leadership of their respective apologetical factions, 1 Dialogues, p. 159. 2 Letters of David Hume (edited by J. Y. T. Greig, Oxford, 1932), II., 334.</page><page sequence="3">336 ERNEST C. MOSSNER: but because of their specific intellectual relationship to the arch-sceptic himself. To identify Demea as Clarke may seem on first consideration unfair to Clarke.. Yet Hume always held Clarke in low esteem. He opposed Clarke's location of the source of moral distinctions in reason. He opposed Clarke's systematization of theology on the abstract mathematical model. He opposed Clarke's disingenuousness on the question of causality. Above all, Hume was rankled by Clarke's metaphysical arrogance.' And he ultimately came to feel for Clarke something akin to contempt. Even Alexander Pope had been prone to make the " gloomy Clerk" profess: We nobly take the high Priori Road, And reason downward, till we doubt of God.2 Little fairness might therefore be expected of Hume toward that divine who in the Preface to his Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God avowed a method " which I have endeavoured should be as near to Mathematical, as the Nature of such a Dis- course would allow." 3 So in the Dialogues Cleanthes and Philo, who live together " in unreserved intimacy," display scant respect for a " rigid inflexible orthodoxy " content to accept its first principles without factual investigation, and from them to deduce a conclusion as demonstrably certain as the proposition that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.4 In fact Philo becomes so strong in "his spirit of opposi- tion, and his censure of established opinions" that Demea finally takes occasion " on some pretence or other, to leave the company." Before Demea's pusillanimous retreat it was Cleanthes as well as Philo who devastatingly blasted the abstractions of " the haughty dogmatist." 6 " I shall not leave it to Philo, said Cleanthes, . . . to point out the weakness of this metaphysical reasoning," and Cleanthes proceeds to cite-and to refute an argu- ment of Clarke's.7 In this connection it ought not to be over- 1 On these points, cf. some typical passages in Philosophical Works of David Hulme (edited by T.

Let us then [Butler had cautioned], instead of that idle and not very innocent employment of forming imaginary models of a world, and schemes of governing it, turn over our thoughts to what we experience to be the conduct of Nature with respect to intelligent creatures.' And Butler recognized that in giving up the a priori for the experiential approach to religion he was giving up dogmatic certainty, " but to Us [he said] probability is the very guide of life." 2 Cleanthes then, whom Hume for artistic and cautionary reasons was trying to insinuate as the " Hero of the Dialogue," was eminently suited by virtue of his historical genealogy to refute Demea.3 Philo, however, might add the concluding touch: The argument a priori has seldom been found very convincing, except to people of a metaphysical head, who have accustomed themselves to abstract reasoning, and who finding from mathematics, that the under- standing frequently leads to truth, through obscurity, and contrary to first appearances, have transferred the same habit of thinking to subjects where it ought not to have place. Other people, even of good sense and the best inclined to religion, feel always some deficiency in such arguments, though they are not perhaps able to explain distinctly where it lies. A certain proof, that men ever did, and ever will, derive their. religion from other sources than from this species of reasoning.4 Under these circumstances Demea may best be taken to re- present, perhaps not so much Clarke personally as the school of Clarke, a practical school of the rank and file of parochial clergy largely devoid of the metaphysical acumen of their once famous interpreter. This explanation accounts for the two seemingly irreconcilable sides of Demea. For Demea is at once the advocate, not only of the Clarkian a priori metaphysical argument, but also of the orthodox precepts common to "all pious divines and preachers ", of " the obscurity of all philosophy," and of " the temerity of prying into his iDivine] nature and essence, decrees 'Analogy of Religion, Introduction, ? 11 in two-volume edition of the Works of Butler (edited by J.

MOSSNER: and attributes." 1 This explanation is therefore more useful than that, founded on an etymological key, of Professor Preserved Smith to the effect that Demea " presents the ordinary opinions of the masses." 2 Such an assignment overlooks one complete aspect of Demea's character; for who, it may well be asked, has ever heard the masses argue to " a necessarilv existent Being" ? 3 The proof a priori, as has just been observed above in the passage quoted from Philo, is restricted to " people of a metaphysical head "; and Clarke himself had admitted that it can never " be made obvious to the Generality of men." 4 So " artfully " indeed does Hume manage the portrayal of Demea thatw an early critic of the Dialogues declares: " I have taken no notice of Hume's Demea, because I cannot find a feature of Christianity about him. Dr. Clarke's metaphysics and the Gospels, have, I think, no sort of connexion." 5 This statement also discloses how markedly Anglicanism had changed since the opening of the century when Clarkism was strong. As a caricature of Clarke voicing "the injudicious reasoning of our vulgar theology," Demea is peremptorily dismissed by Hume before the finale of the Dialogues, to leave an unconfused theatre of disputation to the Lockian theologian and the sceptic.6 Though pretentions to mathematical demonstration of re- ligious tenets might easily be brushed aside by any searching criticism, the argument from design remained a powerful weapon in the armory of the theist. To wresft this last support of the " religious hypothesis" I from the hands of Cleanthes is Hume's ambition in the Dialogues, and indeed his ultimate aim in that branch of philosophy touching upon final problems. Nor was Hume unaware of the prowess of his adversary. When at the age of twenty-six Hume was negotiating the publication of his Treatise of Human- Nature, written during the previous three years in France, he was already an admirer of Butler. Yet even at this date he was a trifle shy of the ecclesi- astic who was then Clerk of the Closet to Queen Caroline and Prebendary of Rochester. Butler's Analogy of Religion had appeared in 1736; his Sermons on Human Nature in 1726, and both of them had caused considerable stir among the thinking IDialogues, pp. 245, 161, 174. Clarke had denied the possibility of comprehending the Divine cssence but claimed that many attributes " are strictly Demonstrable."

Both of them were kmown to,the youthful philosopher. In December, 1737, Hume wrote to Henry Home requesting an introduction to Butler for the purpose of securing his reading of the Treatise while still in manuscript: Your thoughts and mine agree with respect to Dr. Butler, and I would be glad to be introduced to him. I am at present castrating my work, that is, cutting off its nobler parts; that is, endeavouring it shall give as little offence as possible, before which, I could not pretend to put it into the Doctor's hands. This is a piece of cowardice, for which I blame myself, though I believe none of my friends will blame me. But I was resolved not to be an enthusiast in philosophy, while I was blaming other enthusiasms. 2 Previously in the same letter Hume had mentioned " some Reasonings concerning Miracles, which I once thought of publish- ing with the rest, but which I am afraid will give too much offence, even as the world is disposed at present." 2 This excision of the first draft of the essay Of Miracles from the Treatise was un- questionably the most serious part of the operation of " cas- trating." Hume's respect for Butler was tempered only by consideration for his feelings. In March, 1738, Hume again wrote Home of how he had called upon Butler in London to present the letter of introduction, only to discover him out of town. Hume continues, " I am a little anxious to have the Doctor's opinion. My own I dare not trust to ; both because it concerns myself, and because it is so variable, that I know not how to fix it." 3 Later in the same year Butler, in fulfilment of the dying request of the queen, was elevated by George II. to the See of Bristol, and in February, 1739, Hume closed the episode of the Treatise by writing to Home, " I have sent the Bishop of Bristol a copy; but could not wait on him with your letter after he had arrived at that dignity: At least I thought it would be to no purpose after I begun the printing." 5 Still respectful, still somewhat in awe of Butler, Hume made no further effort to meet him in person. Ecclesiastical eminence he felt rendered that undesirable. In any event it is unlikely that Butler would have proved of much assistance to Hume in the revision of the Treatise, inasmuch as he had previously refused to discuss philosophy with Henry 1 This statement runs contrary to the general impression.

MOSSNER: Home himself " on the score of his own natural diffidence and reserve, his being unaccustomed to oral controversy, and his fear that the cause of truth might thence suffer from the unskilfulness of its advocate." 1 In June, 1742, Hume was delighted, however, with the report from London concerning his Essays Moral and Political, published 1741-42, " that Dr. Butler has every where recommended them; so that I hope they will have some success." 2 There is little reason to doubt that Butler was able to identify their anonymity with the anonymity of the Treatise, even if Hume had failed to furnish him with a copy. For they are equally typical of Hume's verve. Their relatively inoffensive religious character not only recommended them to Butler but also insured them an immediate public reception far surpassing that accorded his first philosophical materpiece, emasculated in revision though that had been. The Treatise of Human Nature, which early in 1739 " fell dead-born from the press," 3 included Dr. Butler's name in a list of five "late philosophers in England who have begun to put the science of man on a new footing, and have engaged the attention, and excited the curiosity of the public." 4 This " new footing " was explained in the sub-title to Hume's work as " an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects." The [lreatise moreover contains a definite concession to Butler's Analogy in the admission that, regarding the immortality of the soul, though the metaphysical or a priori arguments are "inconclusive," yet " the moral arguments and those derived from the analogy of nature are equally strong and convincing." 5 This further sample of Hume's castration of the " nobler parts" of the Treatise was made unmistakably out of respect for Butler as a man and as a critic. And, to be sure, a following section of the Treatise dealing with the formation of habit alludes to Butler as " a late eminent philosopher." 6 Hume's true opinion regarding the immortality of the soul, however, ap- pears in an essay of that name, unpublished during his life-time, in which he vigorously repudiates even those arguments for " the religious theory " from morality and from analogy, and ironically concludes, as Locke had previously in earnest, that that doctrine I Cf.

An examination of Hume's other writings confirms the early indication of the Treatise that he regarded Butler as the chief representative among English theologians of the experimental method. In a letter of 1743 to Francis Hutcheson, Hume dared to name and to reject Butler's theological doctrine of conscience expounded in the Sermons an Human Nature; furthermore he deplored the apparent influence of that doctrine on Hutcheson.2 But in his own Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751) that same criticism appears only by implication and without specific men- tion of Butler.3 Even when accepting in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748) Butler's evidence for the dis- interestedness of self-love and benevolence, he does not cite his source but makes indirect reference. In this particular instance Hume is concerned with exalting some late moralists. And shall we esteem it worthv the labour of a philosopher [he asks] to give us a true system of the planets, and adjust the position and order of those remote bodies; while we affect to overlook those, who, with so much success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we are so intimately concerned ? 4 A footnote alludes to Butler as representative of the second class, and as having " proved beyond all controversy " -the moral point at issue. Since the publication of the Treatise Hume had become more outspoken. In 1747 he was willing to admit privately regarding Home's advice against printing the Enquiry just quoted from: "I think I am too deep engaged to think of a retreat.... I see not what bad consequences follow, in the present age, from the character of an infidel; especially if a man's conduct be in other respects irreproachable." 5 The argument of the essay Of a Particular Providence and of a Future State, included in the same Enquiry, is directed mainly against Butler's sober and pains- taking exploitation of the argument from design with its ana- logical reasoning from this life to a future existence. Butler had claimed merely the negative design to show, that the several parts principally objected against in this moral and Christian dispensation, including its scheme, its publication, and the proof which God has afforded us of its truth; that the particular parts 1 '6 Of the Immortality of the Soul," Philosophical Works, IV., 399-406.

MOSSNER: principally objected against in this whole dispensation, are analogous to what is experienced in the constitution and course of Nature, or Providence; that the chief objections themselves which are alleged against the former, are no other than what may be alleged with like justness against the latter, where they are found in fact to be inconclusive. 1 Yet Butler, as in his argument for a future life, frequently used positive analogy.2 The negative aspect, which to the theologian was a reductio ad absurdum of Deism, was tacitly accepted as such by the sceptic. Of the positive, which formed the empirical mainstay of Deistic as well as of Christian Naturalism, it was Hume's conclusion that: All the philosophy, therefore, in the world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us measures of conduct and behaviour different from those which are furnished by reflections on common life. No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis; no event foreseen or foretold; no reward or punishment expected or dreaded beyond what is already known by practice and observation.3 Hume indeed makes no mention of Butler in the essay under consideration, but his intent is none the less plain. It was re- cognized by Professor James Beattie in 1770 and a century later by Professor T. H. Huxley.4 Historically, though the analogical argument had been employed by Bishops Browne and Berkeley, it was presented definitively by Butler, so that after 1736 con- temporary references almost exclusively point to the last named. The general argument from design, of which the analogical argu- ment is but one form, had been stated in 1690 by Locke in the quotation from Cicero: What can be more sillily arrogant and misbecoming, than for a man to think that he has a mind and understanding in him, but yet in all the universe beside there is no such thing ? 5 A1Analogy, Introduction, ? 13. 2 Ibid., I., i. 3 Philosophical Works, IV., 120-121. 4James Beattie, Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth (3rd edition, London, 1772), p. 119.

Since Huxley, Butler's con- nection with the Essay seems to have been generally neglected; his con- nection with the Dialogues has never, I think, been noted. C. W. Hendel in Studies in the Philosophy of David Hume (Princeton, 1925) and Andre Leroy in La Critique et la Religion chez David Hume (Paris, 1930) have some pertinent observations to make concerning the general relationship between Butler and Hume. 5Essay Concerning Human Understanding, IV., x., ? 6, from De.

While not ignored by Cleanthes, that type of the design argument is largely passed by for the analogical. And in so doing Cleanthes is following closely the path set by Butler in his Analogy.1 The apparent boldness of the Enquir?y was short-lived. For the logical attempt of the essay to force Butler to the realization of the basic weakness and even danger of the analogical thesis, Hume was yet desirous to qualify in his latest period as he had been in his earliest. And this concession, however slight or even ironical, seems to have been based ultimately upon his personal respect for Bishop Butler as a thinker. " The greatest name in the Anglican Church " is the tribute paid to Butler a century later by John Henry Newman, and I doubt if Hume would have disputed it.2 His own latest tribute to Butler appears in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. In the penultimate paragraph Hume names two " sects " of the human race alone worthy of Divine consideration: the first, " but a very few " who " merit his favour," being " the philo- sophical theists, who entertain, or rather indeed endeavour to entertain, suitable notions of his divine perfections "; the second, " almost equally rare," being the " philosophical sceptics, who, from a natural diffidence of their own capacity, suspend, or endeavour to suspend all judgment with regard to such sublime and such extraordinary subjects." 3 Thus Cleanthes and Philo are brought together as the "philosophical theist " and the " philosophical sceptic." And that Cleanthes is Butler is again indicated in the final paragraph where, following the very outline of the Analogy, Hume comments in qualification, in disagreement, or in assent of Butler's various arguments. The paragraph opens with a qualification: If the whole of natural theology, as some people seem to maintain [i.e., Butler and his school], resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat 1 Dialogues, p. 177.

Reiterating the finite or anthropomorphic resultants of the religious doctrine of analogy, Hume's primary object in the Dialogues had been to show that Butler's appeal to probability becomes in the event an appeal to possibility, which is no other than the argument to scepticism.' This Humian reductio ad absurdum is driven home with the conclusion that "to be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters [i.e., an educated man], the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian." 2 The " philosophical theist " is in last analysis but little removed from the " philosophical sceptic," Butler but little removed from Hume himself. Because of these almost personal references to Butler and to his works, it seems unlikely that Cleanthes is most accurately identifiable with John Locke, as otherwise judiciously urged by Professor Preserved Smith, again reasoning etymologically.3 Cleanthes' argument is substantially the argument from analogy, an argument which was never elaborated by Locke, but which forms the framework of the Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature. To be sure, Hume on his death-bed actually confessed to the ever-prying James Boswell that " he never had entertained any beleif [sic] in Religion since he began to read Locke and Clarke." 4 But his introduction to their writings took place before he could have known Butler's; probably after 1726 and almost certainly after 1736, the empirical theologian to Hume was Butler. It is remarkable that the same early critic of the Dialogues who noticed the connection between Demea and Clarke also referred to Butler for " an answer to all the deistical or sceptical speculations that ever were or perhaps ever will be published." 5 Joseph Milner felt Hume's essential antagonism to Butler though he did not see that Hume expressed the bishop's position-for ulterior For Butler's doctrine of probability, cf. Analogy, Introduction, ?? 1-5. 2Dialogues, p. 282. 3 Op. cit., II., 524. In distinction to Professor Smith's effort to interpret the interlocutors by the etymology of their names is what seems to me the much sounder historical explanation of Hume's choice of those names given by Professor John Laird. Philo and Cleanthes are both mentioned in Cicero's De Natura Deorumr; Demea is the principal character of Terence's Adelphi and stands for the orthodox opinion. Cf.

MOSSNER: motives-in the person of Cleanthes. To return to Professor Smith, if one may be permitted to understand the theological school of Locke of which Butler was the most eminent spokesman, then there is no pressing need to question his ascription. For though Bishop Butler cannot be held strictly accountable for every phrase put into the mouth of Philo's antagonist, it ought now to be abundantly evident that he represents the basic positions of that speaker's "accurate philosophical turn." Cleanthes, in the words of Philo, is the exponent of " experi- mental theism ; 2 Butler, in the words of Hume in the early Treatise, is the theologian of " the experimental method of reason- ing." And it seems probable that in Hume's mind Cleanthes was Butler. In so far as art can ever be colligated with reality, then, it is reasonable to believe that the Dialogues are susceptible of his- torical interpretation with respect to their background, in parti- cular that Philo, Cleanthes, aAd Demea are identifiable as Hume, Butler, and Clarke respectively. There is no need to push the point too far; indeed it might well be reserved for interpretative purposes only. Yet the three speakers take on a deeper signifi- cance and a heightened dignity because of their historicity. Hume himself was not only a philosopher who so loved the empirical method as to become sceptical of abstractions, but he was also a professional historian. It is this contact with life that makes the Dialogues masterpieces of their kind, that renders them superior, for instance, even to those of Berkeley. Anxious to avoid " that vulgar error . . . of putting nothing but Nonsense into the Mouth of the Adversary," 3 Hume achieved his purpose brilliantly. His characters are not men of straw tilted to be blown down by the slightest puff, but among the finest intellects of the century. If this rendering of the riddle of the Dialogues is in any sense a solution, it may serve to draw attention to one side of Hume's character that too frequently passes unheeded-his timidity. This essential timidity seems of a variety far more deeply in- grained than just the prudential desire not to offend the pro- prieties or to violate the laws of established society, necessary though such tact must have been in eighteenth-century Scotland. This is not the place to recite the penalties, legal and extra- legal, then attached to radical dissent. But an instance or two may be cited to indicate how the threat of such penalties forced a species of conformity upon all thinkers.

Hume also tried to rein in his satirical nature, but Hume's position was far more difficult, as he had pushed past nominalism into scepticism. Hume had seen his friend, the pious Francis Hutcheson, prosecuted in 1737 by the Glasgow Presbytery, and three years later was himself ex- ceedingly worried concerning a " Point of Prudence," knowing full well that " the Consequences are very momentous." 2 His confessed "piece of cowardice " in toning down the Treatise before daring to submit it to Butler may be regarded as a speci- men of mere prudence. But the same can hardly be said for the unseemly repudiation out of the grave-as it were-of the Treatise as " that juvenile work, which the Author never acknow- ledged." 3 The cautious manceuvring to secure posthumous pub- lication of the Dialogues themselves after preserving the manu- script unpublished during some twenty-five years of his life, is a prime example of the more intimate species of timidity.4 Another, and perhaps the most curious, is the early introspective letter to Dr. George Cheyne analysing his own physical and psychological ailments.5 Yet Hume's timidity was not in his thinking; far from that, Hume the thinker at times frightened Hume the man. Nor did he fail to recognize this situation. In 1751 he tells of how he had recently burned an old Manuscript Book, wrote before I was twentv. It begun with an anxious Search after Arguments, to confirm the common Opinion: Doubts stole in, dissipated, returned, were again dissipated, returned again; and it was a perpetual Struggle of a restless Imagination against Inclination, perhaps against Reason.6 Complete suspense of judgment was impossible to maintain; so the Pyrrhonian sceptic of the study became the mitigated sceptic of the salon.

The remark originally appeared in the advertisement to the posthumous (1777) edition of the Essays. 4 A lucid history of this affair is given in Appendix C to the Dialogues, pp. 110-121. 5 Letters, I., 12-18. " So unusual a letter," writes Hume himself. 6 Letters, I., 154.</page><page sequence="15">348 ERNEST C. MOSSNER: religion," Hume replied, " be assured I am tolerably reserved on this head." 1 Hume the philosopher was content to be an "infidel"; but Hume the man blandly remarked to Baron d'Holbach and sixteen other libertins that he had never seen an atheist.2 Hume's timidity as a creature of society and not of the study is best observed, however, in his art as illustrated by the present case of the Dialogues. Ostensibly patterned closely after Cicero's De Natura Deorum, the Dialogues covertly picture Dr. Samuel Clarke, Rector of St. James's, Westminster, and famous Boyle Lectujer in defence of Natural and Revealed Religion, being roundly castigated by Dr. Joseph Butler, Bishop of Bristol and Dean of St. Paul's, while the infidel Hume, besides contributing substantially to Clarke's discomfort, lays a trap in scepticism for the empirical theologian himself. What keen delight it must have afforded Hume thus to play off one theologian against the other, Clarke whom he contemned, Butler whom he respected-but both divines! 3 How little Cleanthes in reality is the " Hero of the Dialogue " is evinced conclusively in the allotment of space to the three speakers: 67 per cent. to Philo, 21 per cent. to Cleanthes, and 12 per cent. to Demea.4 The sceptic is twice as important as the two theists put together. Whatever his artistic intent may have been, Hume was fundamentally the sceptic bringing to a close, at least so far as philosophy was concerned, the Age of Reason in England. Even this truth, basic to any understanding of Hume's place in the history of philosophy, is disguised by the veil of irony and delusion deliberately thrown over the Dialogues as a whole. I wish it were still in my power [wrote Hume in 1764] to be a hypocrite in this particular [of being sincere with " the vulgar " regarding their "superstitions "]. The common duties of society usually require it; and the ecclesiastical profession only adds a little more to an innocent dissimulation, or rather simulation, without which it is impossible to pass through the world.5 1 Letters, I., 189. 2 The complete story is given in Dialogues, p. 48. 3For a few of Hume's typical and informal thrusts at divines, cf. Letters, I., 3, 153, 186, 246, 252, 265-267, 310; II., 92, 244. It is to be observed, however, that after 1769 when he settled in Edinburgh for good, Hume became the intimate friend of several " moderists " among the Scotch clergy. 4These computations are based on the page count given by J. Y. T. Greig in David Hume (London, 1931), p. 236 and n. 5 Letters, I., 439.</page><page sequence="16">THE ENIGMA OF HUME. 349 It is therefore little wonder Hume could exult over his "innocent dissimulation " in the Dialogues "that nothing can be more cautiously and more artfully written." For that is the appro- bation he renders himself. It is the sanction of the philosopher to the artist. It is also the sanction of the hero to the man of the world. Why Hume never spoke out clearly and distinctly is perhaps sufficiently plain to any student of the sociological conditions of his day. Nor was there anything reprehensible in all his precautions. But exactly what Hume would have said if he had been free to speak out can never be more than surmised by any amount of historical study. Indeed the curious and in- timate fusion in Hume of the intellectual hero with the prag- matic man of the world is what properly constitutes the essential paradox and perpetual enigma of his character.</page></plain_text>
