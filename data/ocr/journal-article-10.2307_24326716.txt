The inhabitants of central and southern Baja California are considered to have been the best basket makers producing exceptionally accom plished work on pieces made of fine fibers, deco rated with beads and plumes from various birds. Archaeological findings below the twenty-eighth parallel on the Baja California Peninsula include the recovery of basketry specimens which have since proven to be of the coiled type.The Yumas, north of the thirtieth parallel, and the Seris, on the Sonora coastline, produced similar coiled bas ketwork, albeit technically distinct. It has been demonstrated that the Seris never used baskets as cooking utensils, and that every woman past puberty wove the basket she would use for food gathering, while men never made baskets and rarely used them. Unlike the Seris, Baja Californian men did cre ate baskets, in varying sizes and with very tight weaves.The smallest ones were used for drinking water, the flat ones for eating and the largest ones for food gathering and storage. The basketry remains recovered from the Ocampo and Romero caves in the state of Ta maulipas are noteworthy for their antiquity: dat ing from between 7000 bc and 400 ad, they include examples of mats and baskets made with spiral coiling and plaiting techniques. Basketwork discovered in the Coxcatlan cave in Tehuacan, Puebla, was made with coiling and twining techniques, and dates from between 6500 bc and 460 ad.

During this time,"one has to make sure that animais don't eat the saplings, which grow like a fine, sweet grass. This is why the plant is disappearing in other areas," and few have seen it in bloom.

Each one of the "threads" must be smoothed and worked with a knife in order to remove thorns and other impu rities that could give the object a bad finish.
