<plain_text><page sequence="1">Homer and Stephen Crane WVARREN D. ANDERSON IALTH OUGH The Red Badge of Courage has a secure place in American literature, its antecedents and the attitudes it ex- presses are not yet agreed upon. Origins and attitudes constitute a single question to some significant degree, and any approach to this question must take into account the Homeric element. Crane's critics have not done so, in spite of the author's explicit statements and the suggestions implicit in his novel and his personality. A classicist will find repeated resemblances to Achilles in Crane. A family tradition of military service rendered with honor; the articulation of an intensely personal standard of heroic excellence (arete) that is nevertheless aware of the heroic in other men; withdrawal from one's unthinking fellows, and contempt for their undemanding code; finally, a powerful sense of death soon to come, a sense that mounts into the obsession of an actual death- wish: these characterized Stephen Crane no less than the tragic hero of the Iliad.' He referred to them as directly as he did to Homer, and one may conjecture that the connection at times became a conscious one. Autobiographical and psychoanalytical interpretations of Crane's writing, however, are thought to have assumed too much already. Some of these Achillean traits, especially the death-wish, emerged clearly only during the last six or eight years of his life. To relate them to the early novel on which so much of his reputation rests is not an easy job and may not be a wholly legitimate undertaking. The main purpose of this article is to note certain characteristics Warren D. Anderson is professor of classics at the College of Wooster. 1 See Thomas Beer, Hanna, Crane, and the Mauve Decade (New York, 1941), p. 381; Stephen Crane: Letters, ed. R. W.

[77]</page><page sequence="2">78 Nineteenth-Century Fiction of The Red Badge of Courage, with some attention to the larger perspective of its author's writings and convictions. The whole story of Private Henry Fleming requires only about 160 pages in the telling; Crane called it an episode. He is con- cerned not with menis, the smoldering anger of a grudge such as Achilles nursed, but with a quality of spirit for which English has no single word. The Homeric poems speak of it as menos, and it often refers to the transfiguring battle-rage of the brave fighter. Its opposite is fear; the relationship between the two opposites powerfully informs Crane's novel. One notes that in the formal presentation of his theme he has divided this strikingly short work into twenty-four chapters, their average length only about a half-dozen pages. The end of a chapter, moreover, does not necessarily mark a break in the action. It would seem difficult to account for this wealth of chapters, which the newspaper seriali- zation arrangements did not require, unless perhaps it hints at the traditional division of Iliad and Odyssey into twenty-four books each. At all events, Henry Fleming and his adventures have their Homeric counterparts. Though he acts from very different mo- tives, Achilles too retires from battle, is profoundly affected by the death of a comrade, and returns to overwhelm the enemy with a furious attack. Telemachus gains a courage (menos as boldness of spirit) that brings him from adolescence to the full stature of young manhood. At the climactic moment of his life, Hector finds himself obeying impulses more primordial than the civilized im- perative that calls us to render our duty. Moreover, both Homeric poems have been thought to deal with self-discovery, which for Achilles at least means discovering the true nature of heroism (arete) without illusion. Like Homer, Crane treats various kinds of non-mortal entities as immediate and potent factors in war. Such epic fixtures are creations, even aspects, of man's mind; here the difference between the two writers may lie chiefly in the degree of awareness. But what matters is that Crane gives the impression of consciously following Homeric and Vergilian precedent. He lends an objec- tive vividness to these subjective qualities by presenting them in the form of gods or goddesses, demons or witches. Actually he recognizes, within the frame of illusion, only one god and one goddess. The dominant entity, almost the center of a battle-</page><page sequence="3">Homer and Stephen Crane 79 spawned monotheism, is the war-god. He is repeatedly suggested as being swollen and red, not majestic but animal-like. Homer had created a double Ares, anthropomorph and battle-spirit; Crane grants neither human form nor abstract status, suggesting instead the arcane bestiality of a Moloch. Unlike the war-god, the goddess of The Red Badge of Courage does have an epiphany. She is the battle-flag, the symbol and prize of valor that floats untouched above the fighting. She appears but once, nevertheless, and then as a mere image in the excited mind of Henry Fleming. Clearly Nike does not have the stature of Polemos: victory is relative and ephemeral, war a grim enduring absolute. Terror, rout, and the fear that leads to flight all take personified form in the Iliad; so Henry Fleming, lying awake on the night before his first battle, saw in the darkness "visions of a thousand- tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee" (chap. ii); and the next day (chap. iii), as action became imminent, his old fears "reassailed him, but. . . he doggedly let them babble." Later (chap. xi), in a surge of theoretical bravery, Henry imagines himself rushing to the front "to seize and throttle the dark, leering witch of calamity." We are familiar with the elaborate and bizarre personification of rumor in Aeneid 4. Homer had already set the precedent; the idea of swift, towering growth into the heavens comes, moreover, from his image of Eris, quickly-spreading Strife. Vergil's special contribution consists in presenting Fama as a bird. Whether he maintains the tradition consciously or not, Crane writes (chap. iv) that the Union troops "mouthed rumors that had flown like birds out of the unknown"; on a later occasion (chap. xvi) "Among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew, but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope." This second comparison, free from Vergil's extravagance, achieves as great an effectiveness. Elsewhere (chaps. v and xxiii) bird imag- ery once or twice describes the flags, which seem to Henry Fleming "like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm," or the battle shock itself-he expects "an encounter of strange beaks and claws, as of eagles." Obvious borrowings from antiquity almost never appear in The Red Badge of Courage. One striking and beautiful exception (chap. iii): as the morning sun burns away the mist "regiments</page><page sequence="4">80 Nineteenth-Century Fiction burst into view like armed men just born of the earth." When Crane writes in the same chapter that "the insects, nodding upon their perches, crooned like old women," the reader of Homer remembers the old men on Troy's wall, piping like cicadas, though the resemblance may be a matter of coincidence. More difficult to dismiss is the incident (chap. vii) in which Henry, after running from the fighting, chases away an inquisitive squirrel and takes its flight as "a sign" justifying his own behavior. One wonders too at the way Henry, stumbling with head bowed in an oblivion of pain, is quickly and surely guided to his own unit by a stranger identified only as "the man of the cheery voice." He "seemed to the youth to possess a wand of a magic kind," says Crane (chap. xii), and "threaded the mazes of the tangled forest with a strange fortune." As he left Henry "it suddenly occurred to the youth that he had not once seen his face." So in the Iliad a god will spirit a wounded fighter away to safety without reveal- ing his own nature. It must be noted that Crane took this particu- lar incident from a similar but less dramatic boyhood experience;2 his reason for using it is perhaps another matter. The most remarkable parallel with Homer does not consist in any of these particulars: it may be found throughout the novel, in Crane's use of similes. The sheer quantity of them (about 160, without including instances in dialogue) is impressive, but what interests a classicist reader is the way they are handled. Most often Crane compares men in war to animals, though an occasional vignette will be taken from peacetime life.3 Fleeing troops are likened to helpless sheep or chickens; when they attack, however, they become maddened horses, fierce hounds, wolves, eagles, panthers. Troop columns are dragons, winding serpents, moving monsters with many feet. A shattered line of charging men buckles slowly like a toppling wall, it curls and writhes like a snake trodden underfoot. John Berryman has said of Crane: "His animism is like nothing else in civilized literature. Mountains, trees, dogs, men, horses, 2Stephen Crane: An Omnibus, ed. R. W.

Eric Solomon, ib., pp. 324-325).</page><page sequence="5">Homer and Stephen Crane 81 and boats flash in and out of each other's identities."4 The second statement is profoundly true. The first is not, unless Homer be thought uncivilized, for essentially the same unreflecting sense of man's oneness with the natural creation underlies the greater part of Homeric simile. This sense disappears early in the development of a culture-the seventh-century lyric poet Alcman seems still to have it, for example, whereas Euripides and Vergil clearly do not -and when it has gone its place is taken by a conscious dealing with nature (the capitalized form, Nature, now begins to have appropriateness) that betrays the sense of disjunction. The Iliad can compare fighting men to wolves or again to donkeys or wasps as the occasion demands, quite without ludicrousness: the com- parison rests upon a basis of community. The Romantic poets could not work from any such presupposition, and there is a certain shock in the realization that The Red Badge of Courage came only four decades after the death of Wordsworth. Yet once in a great while a writer appears who celebrates the ancient union as if it had never been dissolved. Such very likely is Nikos Kazant- zakis in his Sequel to the Odyssey; such was Stephen Crane beyond all doubt, and his similes are more truly Homeric than those of Kazantzakis. For proof, one may consider their distribution. It directly re- flects the immediacy and intensity of battle. Only two chapters out of the entire twenty-four use a large number of similes for any other purpose: these are the second, in which the description of a regiment marching toward battle sets the novel's tone, and the ninth, which records the death of Jim Conklin. Everywhere else similes become more frequent in proportion as the fighting becomes more savage. By the same token they occur only rarely during lulls in the fighting, and they are wholly absent from the two chapters (the tenth and the fifteenth) which deal exclusively wvith inner moods and personal relationships. Such technique may justifiably be called Homeric. The main strategy is clearly that of the Iliad; and Crane parallels Homer even on the more imme- diate level of tactics, for he deploys his similes at various times to mark a crisis or transition or to render in depth the several aspects of a given situation. Though one or two instances seem to echo particular similes applied to Ajax and Hector, there is no need to labor these parallels. 4Stephen Crane (London, 1950), p. 268. Berrvman has partly in mind the Suillivan County Sketches.</page><page sequence="6">82 Nineteenth-Century Fiction After Crane's death his family and friends recalled the vivid way he would tell aloud the stories he was writing, improvising similes as the impulse moved him.' His actual manner of composi- tion aroused wonder: he wrote without pausing, we are told, as if every detail were already formed within his mind-though in fact he revised with great care. This indicates nothing about the kind or degree of talent involved, for the same thing is recorded of Menander, of Mozart, and indeed of Kipling; but when it is combined with improvisatory brilliance in a teller of tales the term bardic comes to mind. Whether or not Crane used the Iliad and Odyssey, his affinities with their unknown creator are not easily denied.6 Little evidence can be brought to bear directly on the question of influence. Crane grew up in a cultured family at a time when some measure of acquaintance with Greek epic was to be expected in educated persons, but we do not actually know that he possessed such knowledge. At preparatory school he was enrolled in the "academic" rather than the "classical" curriculum, and during the one semester he attended Lafayette College his subjects were those of a student aiming at a degree in mining engineering. Transferring to Syracuse University, he enrolled as a special student in the "Scientific" curriculum; but the only part of it for which he registered was an English literature course.7 Although Crane later recalled his dislike of the "cut-and-dried curriculum," it is curious that after his 1897 visit to Greece he told an English acquaintance, in the pseudo-American dialect he enjoyed using to bewilder Englishmen, "When I planted those hoofs of mine 5 C. K. Linson, My Stephen Crane (Syracuse, 1958), p. 88. Through textual study Stallman, pp. 209-211, has demonstrated that Crane was not a purely inspirational vriter. 6 My colleague, Professor Thomas D. Clareson, suggests that Crane may have drawn upon Homeric epic for his general conception of war. Certainly it is here that the problem lies, for source studies have shown that many and diverse sources may have been available for his particulars. 7During the second of the three terms which then comprised the academic year, Chancellor Charles N. Sims taught "English Literature," described simply as "a study of authors and literature to the time of Queen Anne" (Annual of the Syracuse University for the Collegiate Year 1891-92 [Syracuse, 1891], p. 25). The statement in Stallman and Gilkes, p. 307, n. 12, that Professor Frank Smalley had Crane as a Latin student at Syracuse is inaccurate so far as any formal study is concerned. Photostatic copies of the Registrar's entry for Stephen Crane and the 1891-92 Annual were made available through the kindness of Mr. John S. Mayfield, Curator of Manuscripts and Rare Books, Syracuse University Library; I gratefully acknowl- edge his aid.</page><page sequence="7">Homer and Stephen Crane 83 on Greek soil I felt like the hull of Greek literature, like one gone over to the goldarned majority. I'd a great idea of Greece. One catches these fleas at Syracuse, N'Yark." It would be inter- esting to know just what truth lies concealed in that jest. The Red Badge of Courage has been called anti-heroic and its author "the expression of certain enormous repudiations." Whether H. G. Wells' phrase can rightly include a repudiation of heroism remains to be determined. The verdict will have an important bearing on the question of Crane's relationship to the tradition that begins with Homer. Whenever such a problem arises students of Crane find themselves confronted with the enigma of his irony, so evidently present, so far from evident in its meaning. The irony of The Red Badge of Courage centers on Henry's illusions about himself and about the nature of war. As the action proceeds these illusions give way before the shock of reality. His assumptions prove wrong; what he had thought could not be manifests itself as actual fact. The first chapter makes clear one of his chief illusions: He had long despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle. Such would be no more, he had said. Men were better, or more timid. Secular and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or else firm finance held in check the passions. He had burned several times to enlist. Tales of great movements shook the land. They might not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to be much glory in them. He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all. His busy mind had drawn for him large pictures extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds. Crane occasionally uses verbatim repetition to underscore a point in whole or in part. The second chapter shows this device: He was brought then gradually back to his old ideas. Greeklike struggles would be no more. Men were better, or more timid. Secular and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or else firm finance held in check the passions. The novel as a whole provides an extended refutation of this illusion. Men are not more timid, they have not lost the throat- grappling instinct: when the battle-rage comes upon them they fight with the ferocity of savages or beasts of prey. To be sure, the combat is not precisely Homeric, since the days of the monomachia</page><page sequence="8">84 Nineteenth-Century Fiction or knightly duel have passed. It is an infantry battle where men must stand together against the enemy, as the war-poet Tyrtaeus had urged in seventh century Sparta. The group effort counts for everything, and selflessness-the "incredible selflessness" that comes over Henry Fleming at one point-has become the highest virtue. It must be asked whether this means that in Crane's view per- sonal heroism can no longer exist. If so, his novel is to that considerable extent anti-heroic. But such heroism is a real and respected quality among Fleming's officers and fellow-soldiers, despite the unpretentious language they use to describe it. He himself is quietly proud of what he has achieved and feels that his experience has made him a man, ready to face the world. Yet he dissociates himself from war: "He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war." This assessment is Crane's final verdict in The Red Badge of Courage. It reflects the naturalistic doctrine of man as an ani- mal; it also implies that valor in war represents not arete, excel- lence, but a madness like the delirium of a sick man. Over the full range of Crane's work, however, this verdict is not final. It could not be: naturalism will never adequately define the temperament and genius of this man, so keenly aware of his ancestors' honorable service during the Revolution and the War of 1812. Here a distinction must be made between author and protagonist. Henry Fleming never advances in his conscious think- ing beyond the first impression of the regiment as a moving box, constantly enclosing him within its four sides that were built of tradition and lawv. He reappears as "Old Fleming," the central figure of one of the later stories, "The Veteran"; at its climax he dies in a courageous effort to rescue colts from a blazing barn: When the roof fell in, a great funnel of smoke swarmed toward the sky, as if the old man's mighty spirit, released from its body-a little bottle-had swelled like the genie of fable. The smoke was tinted rose- hue from the flames, and perhaps the unutterable midnights of the universe will have no power to daunt the colour of this soul.8 S Quoted in Berryman, p. 325. The need to distinguish between a man's works and his life has been well brought out by Stallman, pp. 188-189. A significant parallel, perhaps not previously noticed, seems to exist betwveen the conclusion of</page><page sequence="9">Homer and Stephen Crane 85 It is a fitting end for the man first shown as a raw infantry private, and it honors bravery; but it represents no advance beyond the earlier stage. Even the famous color symbolism has been retained. Crane's own belief, reinforced by personal knowledge of wars and shipwreck, does not find a fully articulate voice in his writing until the end of his life has drawn near. Now the simile of the moving box seems almost to be echoed, but only as a sign of the transition to another level of experience and meaning, a level of higher understanding where the nameless valiant ones receive at last their tribute. There is no irony or ambiguity here: thought and style alike have changed. The story is "The Clan of No- Name"; the passage quoted here gives the thoughts of a young officer, Manolo Prat, in his last battle-thoughts of the brotherhood whom the law of courage has always joined. Here Stephen Crane speaks for himself, and thereby becomes the spokesman of all that company whose traditions go back to Hector and Achilles: Men could have been drunken in all this flashing and flying and snarling and din, but at this time he was very deliberate. He knew that he was thrusting himself into a trap whose door, once closed, opened only when the black hand knocked and every part of him seemed to be in panic-stricken revolt. But something controlled him; something moved him inexorably in one direction; he perfectly under- stood but he was only sad.... He was of a kind-that seemed to be it -and the men of his kind, on peak or plain, from the dark northern ice-fields to the hot wet jungles, through all wine and want, through all lies and forgotten truth, dark or light, the men of his kind were governed by their gods, and each man knew the law and yet could not give tongue to it, but it was the law . . . always with the law there is only one way. But from peak and plain, from dark northern ice- fields and hot wet jungles, through wine and want, through all lies this passage and that of the two unpublished paragraphs which followed "He was gleeful when he discovered that he now despised them" (chap. xxiv, fifth paragraph from the end) in the original MS. The second of these ends as follows: "He beheld that he was tiny but not inconsequent to the sun. In the space-wide whirl of events no grain like him would be lost" These words do not seem to me to be intended as expressions of self-delusion or pretentiousness. (See Bradley, pp. 117 and 341, for the unpublished passage and J. B. Colvert's interpretation; also p. 308, for S. B. Greenfield's countering claims of irony and delusion.) There is the further point that the sentence which actually follows in the published text, "With this conviction came a store of assurance," appears to refer most naturally to the con- cluding idea of the two unpublished paragraphs.</page><page sequence="10">86 Nineteenth-Century Fiction and unfamiliar truth, dark or light, he heard breathed to him the approval and the benediction of his brethren.9 9 The Work of Stephen Crane, ed. Wilson Follett, 12 vols. (New York, 1925-1927), II, 163-164. Berryman quotes the passage on p. 254 and adds, "The essential dif- ference between this story and the others is that it was written for himself." D. G. Hoffman, The Poetry of Stephen Crane (New York, 1957), pp. 150 and 215, gives another example of heroism considered without irony and notes the foreshadowing of the brotherhood of danger in The Red Badge. The next to last sentence quoted here is repeated almost verbatim at the end of "The Clan of No-Name"; Crane's use of emphatic, closely spaced repetition at this time (1898) constitutes a striking departure from his earlier fiction techniques. In "Stephen Crane's Metaphor of Decorum" (PMLA, LXXVIII [1963], 250-256, esp. 251) G. W. Johnson holds that Crane's imagination "hardly moved at all" after The Red Badge of Courage because there he "had already discovered that the game of the strenuous life had no goal, that men were nothing without rules but that the rules killed them." While the latter claim is manifestly true, the former does not necessarily follow from it. The present study has attempted to show that a further development could and did take place.</page></plain_text>
