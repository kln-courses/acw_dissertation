<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 4 No. 3 Inigo Jones and Renaissance art John Peacock 1 INTRODUCTION We think of Inigo Jones as the first classical architect in England, who showed his compatriots a version of what had been going on in Italian architecture over the previous 150 years. But well before he was in a posi tion to do this, becoming Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615, he was in troducing the Stuart courtiers to the traditions of Renaissance art, with which they were still largely unfamiliar, on a broader front. He did this through the court masques; and he did it with some deliberation. It may seem strange to see the masques as vehicles of a didactic pro gramme. Bacon called them 'toys', trivial diversions. But the rulers who commissioned these extravagant spectacles, and the artists who produced them, both took them very seriously.' When the Dowager Grand Duchesses of Tuscany granted a privilegio to Giulio Parigi in 1626, it in cluded among his works the famous intermedi staged in 1608.2 Ben Jon son, who wrote many of the masques which Jones designed, was fond of stressing the significance of their content: 'though their voyce be taught to sound to present occasions, their sense . . . should alwayes lay hold on more remou'd mysteries ,3 In his preface to The Masque of Queens (1609) he described himself as 'obseruing that rule of the best Artist, to suffer no object of delight to passe without his mixture of profit, &amp; example'.4 Here, in specifically invoking the Horatian principle of delightful I should like to thank Mrs Lesley Le Claire, Librarian of Worcester College, Oxford, for the oppor tunity to study Jones's books and annotations in pleasant surroundings; and Dr Anthony Johnson, for allowing me to read his D.Phil, thesis. My research has been generously supported by the Leverhulme Trust. I am especially grateful to Gordon Higgott, Edmund Papst, Tony Crowley and Ken Hirschkop for help both intellectual and practical.

Not only is he using 'picture', in collaboration with Jonson's poetry, to communicate philosophical, ethical and political ideas; he is inducing his audience to revise radically their ideas about what 'picture' is, to adopt a wholly new concept of visual art. Rubens described Jones's friend and patron the Earl of Arundel as an evangelist of art.7 The term could have been even more aptly applied to Jones. As the first English artist to acquire a deep and inward knowledge of the whole Renaissance tradition, he was able to grasp just how marginal to that tradition was the visual culture of his own country: in spite of the impact of Holbein and numerous lesser continental artists, English art was still in outer darkness. It was to this situation that he ad dressed himself. At the outset of his career, his friend the antiquarian Ed mund Bolton identified him as a person of peculiar promise, 'through whom there is hope that ... all that is praiseworthy in the elegant arts of the ancients, may one day find their way across the Alps into our England'.8 These words were written in a copy of Gianfrancesco Bordino's De rebus praeclare gestis a Sixto V, a poem celebrating the energetic pope who had combined moral reforms with a sweeping aesthetic transformation of the city of Rome. Bolton was defining a mission and a programme for Jones, and Jones responded to the challenge. By the end of his career he had realized Bolton's hopes. 2 THE PROGRAMME Bolton's expectations must bear some relation to Jones's ambitions, and may provide insight into what these were. First, it is necessary to sidestep the erroneous translation of Bolton's Latin by J. A. Gotch, which others have since repeated without question: Mercury son of Jove to his own Inigo Jones through whom there is hope that sculpture, modelling, architecture, painting, acting and all that is 5 Benjonson, The Complete Poems, ed.

MERCURIUS IOVIS FILIUS.10 Gotch makes three mistakes, not fully understanding the context of Bolton's inscription. The final phrase is obviously not a signature but a motto. The for mula 'Mercurius Iovis filius' is explained by the British mythographer Alexander Ross: 'They called him the son of Jupiter; to shew, that elo quence, sciences, and ingenuous arts are the gift of God.'" This is Mer cury in his role as divine patron of 'the witty arts', as Bolton calls them in another place.12 Cartari, whose book Jones posssessed, quotes a string of classical authors on Mercury as 'inventore di tutte le buone arte'.13 He goes on to say that the characteristic Greek statues of Mercury or Hermes, the herms, were placed 'as ornaments in schools and academies', and refers to Cicero's search for herms to adorn his own private Academy.14 Now, we know that the great project of Bolton's life was the foundation of a national academy under royal patronage, for which he petitioned James I ten years later, in 1617; and that Jones was to be one of the members.15 Whether he is alluding at this early stage to his vision of an academy, and to Jones as a future academician, we cannot be certain. What is clear is that he invokes Mercug-y as the god who teaches humans 'all the good arts',16 and salutes Jones as the potential teacher in England of those best known to him - what we would call the fine arts, and he knew as the arts of design. There is no need to make the word 'suo' refer to Mercury; it simply means that Jones is Bolton's friend. Mercury evokes the context in which 9 J. A.

One function of the letterati in these relationships was to encourage and assist the artists to articulate their ideas, not only in the visual discourse of art but in speech and writing. In this perspective Bolton's inscription can be seen not just as a one-sided demand, unilaterally imposing a programme on Jones, so much as a collaborative statement eliciting and recording Jones's aspirations as they have emerged in the intercourse between artist and writer. Shakespeare had (at least according to Jonson) 'small Latin', Jones pro bably even less. By formulating his programme in Latin, Bolton offers the artist a voice which he could otherwise literally not have exercised. In general, the Latin language stresses the scope of Jones's project, extend ing in space across Europe and in time back to antiquity. In a more specific sense, the rhetorical form of Bolton's Latin text adds a dimension to the meaning; it has itself been fetched 'across the Alps'. His listing of the arts follows a humanist formula from the fifteenth century. Its deriva tion is revealed in his concept of the 'veterum elegantiae': this appears in the preface to Lorenzo Valla's Elegantiae linguae latinae, produced around 1440, the influential anthology of the arts of language as prac tised by the best known Roman writers. Valla makes a historically self conscious reference to that revival of the arts which came to be seen by Vasari in the next century as a 'rinascità' and by writers of the nineteenth century as the Renaissance: I do not know why the arts most clearly approaching the liberal arts - painting, sculpture in stone and bronze, and architecture - had been in so long and so deep a decline and almost died out together with literature itself; nor why they have come to be aroused and come to life again in this age; nor why there is now such a rich harvest both of good artists and good writers." The relevant section, in Valla's Latin, runs: 'illae artes quae proximae ad liberales accedunt, Pingendi, Scalpendi, Fingendi, Architectandi . . .'18 This was followed by Erasmus, about fifty years later, in a comparison between the revival of eloquence and of the visual arts, whose products he listed as 'caelaturas, picturas, sculpturas, aedificia, fabricas et omnium 17 Quoted Erwin Panofsky, Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art (Stockholm, 1960), 16 and note 3: '[Nescio] cur illae artes quae proximae ad liberales accedunt, Pingendi, Scalpendi, Fingendi, Architectandi, aut tamdiu tantoque opere degeneraverint, ac pene cum litteris ipsi demor tuae fuerint, aut hoc tempore excitentur, ac reviviscant . . 18 Ibid. 16 n. 3.</page><page sequence="5">InigoJones and Renaissance art 249 denique officiorum monimenta . . .'19 And over a century after that Bolton is still using essentially the same formula, together with Valla's notion of recovering the 'elegantiae veterum', the choicest aesthetic ef fects of the ancients. What use to Bolton is a structure of words and ideas fashioned by an Italian in the early fifteenth century, and taken up by a Netherlander at the end of it - and appropriate to each of those distant historical moments - for describing Jones's situation in England at the beginning of the seventeenth century? Can it fit that situation? Bolton does adapt the formula by making two changes. One is to extend the list of arts: to the standard constellation of painting, two kinds of sculpture and architec ture he adds the puzzling (and by Gotch misconstrued) 'Mimisim' - which we must investigate in a minute. The other is to acknowledge that Valla's gap between the visual and the liberal arts has since been closed; if the stylistic criterion of what he elsewhere calls 'elegancy'20 can be transferred from language to the visual arts then they have become liberal. But these changes do not alter the basic stance which Bolton takes up, that of the literary humanist welcoming a revival of the arts. The apparent anachro nism is precisely the point, and implies that England is still only on the verge of that revival. The passage of the arts across the Alps will produce a rehearsal of that rebirth of antiquity which brought the arts in Italy to their modern fulfilment. By reusing a rhetorical formula straight from the context of quattrocento humanism, designed to greet self-consciously the dawn of Italian Renaissance art, Bolton more resonantly acknow ledges the backwardness of his native culture and asks Jones to transform it, by initiating the Renaissance in England. His appeal sweeps out of account whatever responses to the revival of the arts England had actually made in the course of the sixteenth cen tury. Its neo-humanist tone perhaps allows it to be seen as a backward looking view, rather than a simply progressive view of a backward situation. Bolton, antiquarian and Catholic, was 'old-fashioned' both in occupation and religion. The ambiguity here springs from the poem which he is inscribing to Jones, and which itself forms part of what he has to communicate. It celebrates Sixtus V as a protagonist of the counter Reformation, a figure who revives the energy of the High Renaissance papacy but in a radically reforming spirit, who makes a fresh start, and looks to win back lost ground. One result, Bordino piously hopes, will be an extension of Rome's influence to the heretical hinterlands, including England, and their reabsorption into the Church.21 Bolton paraphrases 19 Ibid. 17 n. 1. 20 Edmund Bolton, The Roman Histories of Lucius Iulius Florus (London, 1610), A6 verso; Hypercritica, 248, 252, in Joseph Haslewood, Ancient Critical Essays Upon English Poets and Poesy, vol II (London, 1815). 21 G.

The implication, in the light of the poem, is that, whatever has been won or lost in the past, a radical new beginning is to be made. Jones, who was gradually to reveal (in the context of his generally progressive work) his own 'old-fashioned' side, especially in his campaign to take architecture back to the tenets of Palladio, would have found this assumption sym pathetic. He was to re-enact the Renaissance. The idea of re-enactment links up to the word which Bolton has added to the list of arts, 'Mimisim'. This is a quasi-Latinized form of the Greek 'mimesis', and is best construed with reference to its original context. All Bolton's vocabulary of art terms, apart from their intelligibility through usage, has an authentic provenance in the Kunstliteratur of antiquity. 'Statuaria', 'Plastice' and 'Pictura' are the terms used by Pliny in the rele vant sections of his account of the arts. 'Architectura' derives its concep tual authority from the famous treatise of Vitruvius. And 'Mimesis' is given its definitive meaning for the Renaissance in the Poetics of Aris totle. There it has a broader and a narrower meaning. In general it denotes the universal human instinct for imitation22 which Aristotle sees as one of the root causes of poetry, and of the imitative function of art. More specifically it describes the imitative function of poetry, or rather - since Aristotle's discussion of tragedy does not focus exclusively on poetry as a verbal medium - of poetic drama performed with all the resources of the theatre. Although he wrote occasional verses, Jones was no poet; but up to the time of Bolton's dedication nearly all his work had been in the theatre. If we insert this fact into the context provided by Aristotle, we can define the term 'Mimesis' used by Bolton to Jones as 'theatrical representation' or 'the imitative arts of the theatre as detailed in Aristotle's Poetics'. What are the Aristotelian arts of the theatre from a modern point of view? Aristotle's paradigm of a theatrical text is tragedy, and he says that tragedy has six parts - plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle and song.23 The first four of these can be subsumed into the category of poetry in the verbal sense; this goes, in part, for song as well. Rationalizing these categories with Jones's theatre in mind, we get poetry, spectacle and music. In addition, we have to remember that the Poetics was read through the filter of sixteenth-century translators and commentators. The most influential of these, Castelvetro and Minturno, both included dance as a part of 'poetry' in the general sense, drawing out an implica tion in the Poetics that it is theatrically mimetic, as dramatic language Bolton, as note 12, 60: 'to imitate is generally imprest in the nature of man . . Poetics VI.7 in S. H. Butcher, Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art (New York, 1951), 25.</page><page sequence="7">InigoJones and Renaissance art 251 is.24 This gives us four mimetic arts of the theatre: poetry, spectacle, music and dance. These are precisely the constituents of Jones's court masques. Osten sibly he had come closer to the theatre of antiquity in the four plays he produced before the king at Oxford in 1605, which included a tragedy, a comedy and a satyr play all in Latin, and used the scenic periaktoi (rotating prisms) described by Vitruvius, together with costumes 'of An tique fashions'.25 But these were university texts which gave priority to rhetorical declamation, and desiderated a scenic classicism of a somewhat archaeological kind. Moreover, Jones was making a special effort for a rare occasion, since royal visits to the university were few and far between (he did not work in Oxford again for thirty years). It was the court in Whitehall that offered the resources and opportunities for realizing a modern idea of the aesthetic complexity of the ancient theatre. And the court theatre was coming to be dominated by the annual productions of the masques. When Bolton wrote his dedication (it is dated 30 December 1606) Jones had already staged The Masque of Blackness and Hymenaei, on Twelfth Night 1605 and 1606 respectively; the sequel to Blackness, The Masque of Beauty, was awaited (eventually to be done in 1608); and in a few days, on Twelfth Night 1607, Lord Hay's Masque was to be pro duced. Whether Jones was responsible for that production is not certain, but likely,26 and if so the impending challenge to his powers would have given a special point to Bolton's words. But in any case both men would have understood that Jones's obvious vehicle for reviving the ancient arts of theatrical representation was to be the masque, which combined those arts - poetry, spectacle, music and dance - in a single format. How far Bolton's implied neo-classical characterization of the masque from his old-fashioned, humanist point of view would have been generally shared is open to question. Obviously the masque was not meant to be a programmatic recreation of the theatre of antiquity - such as attempted by the Florentine Camerata, by the Vicentine Academy in Palladio's Teatro Olimpico, or in part by Jones himself at the Oxford performances - since the format which united the various arts of the masque was not that of antique drama. But within this modern format Jones's two masque productions to date had been consciously neo-antique in content. Ben Jonson's already published text of Hymenaei (1606) had insisted that the 'inventions' of masques must be 'grounded upon antiquitie', and he stressed this with an apparatus of scholarly notes (to be repeated in later texts) giving references to classical sources.27 Hymenaei was constructed 24 P.

He was not after all asking Jones to replicate antique art, but to recreate its aesthetic effects ('omnem veterum elegantiarum laudem') as they had already been recreated 'across the Alps', in the art of Renaissance Italy. And Jones's special contribution to the theatrical arts - if we distinguish between his roles as producer of the masques and designer - was the introduction of modern Italian perspective scenery, unknown to the Greeks and Romans. Nevertheless, the Italians from whom he learnt it were quite accustomed to having their art praised for reviving the achievements of the ancients. Buontalenti's intermedi in Florence of 1586 were compared to antiquity; and his work for the opera II rapimento di Cefalo in 1600 was described as a unique revival of the ar tistic glories of the Romans.29 Daniele Barbaro, in his theoretical treatise on perspective scenery, also brings past and present together in this way, and, in the light of Vitruvius's usage of the Greek-derived term 'sceno graphia', traces the history of modern scenography back to the Greeks.30 The idea of regarding advances in knowledge and performance as success ful returns to the past is of course central to the dynamic of Renaissance art, and Bolton's inscription compactly rehearses it. According to this way of thinking all aspects of the arts of Jones's theatre can be seen as an tiquity revived. Some such thinking is necessary to substantiate the 'hope' expressed by Bolton's inscription. Although it looks to the future, there is an implied suggestion of some achievement on Jones's part already; and the fact is that, aside from the mysterious reference to him as a 'picture-maker' in 1603,31 his only palpable achievements had been in the theatre. But how was Jones's work in the theatre supposed to lead on to the arrival of sculpture, architecture and painting in England? This bears on Gotch's final mistranslation, of 'irrepturas' as 'may . . . find their way'. The word is not so vague; it is related to modern English 'surreptitious', and denotes an incursion which is both intentional and covert. Cicero uses it to describe certain effects of oratory, which operate powerfully but 28 Ibid. 229, lines 584-5. 29 Descrizione Del Magnifieentiss. Apparato.

There may be an irreverent or comic suggestion here which links up with one of Mercury's functions, since part of his general port folio as the god of all kinds of transactions and mediations was to be patron of thieves. But whether joking or not, Bolton uses a pointed and idiosyncratic metaphor which must mean something to him and Jones but otherwise begs explanation. It may be best understood if taken along with the other troublesome word, 'Mimisim' - 'theatrical representation'. Jones's theatre, following the court theatre of Cinquecento Italy, and through that harking back to the authentic complexity of the theatre of antiquity (or to the late Renaissance idea of that?), aimed at an ideal similar to Wagner's later Gesamstkunstwerk - the total theatrical work of art, composed of a range of contributory modes of representation. It was compendious in two senses, one of which has already been considered. It combined poetry, spectacle, music and dance. Of the constituents, only one was Jones's work, but he was attentive to the others - for example, he studied Plutarch's essay on dance33 - since the realization of the whole was his responsibility as producer. But his more specialized work as designer was also compendious, since in practice it consisted of putting together images and motifs already devised by other artists. All Jones's stage-designs are copied, as we shall shortly be seeing in detail. Both as producer and designer he was co-ordinating pre-existing representations into a new whole. This idea of Jones as a compendious artist seems to be an established theme of his early career, long before the wide-ranging activities of his later years. It was to be reiterated in 1611, in the comic Latin poem celebrating Thomas Coryate's Philosophical Banquet. There he appears in the roll-call of guests as Nec indoctus nec profanus Ignatius architectus.34 This is a parody of the famous characterization of the architect by Vitruvius, who requires that he should have a wide knowledge of other disciplines; and the degree of this knowledge is calculated with a series of double negatives: Non enim debet nec potest esse architectus grammaticus, uti fuerit Aristarchus, sed non agrammatus, nec musicus ut Aristoxenus, sed 32 Orator, ed. and trans.

He would have taken the Vitru vian pattern of the architect very seriously because it provided the ideal matrix for all the artistic ambitions listed by Bolton. And even though at the earlier time of Bolton's dedication Jones was not 'Ignatius archi tectus', he was certainly 'Ignatius mimeticus', and the later role is foreshadowed by the earlier as a pattern of wide-ranging artistic endeavour. As yet Jones had no prospect of a career in architecture, but was firmly established in the theatre; and it must logically be through the all embracing art of 'Mimesis', the most ready vehicle for 'omnem veterum elegantiarum laudem', that he is envisaged as instrumental in the passage of the other, individual arts into England. Within the total representation which it constructed from poetry, spectacle, music and dance, his theatre in its crucial visual dimension which he designed, also compendiously represented the work of the countless sculptors, architects and painters from whom Jones derived his scenography. Conceivably Bolton is making a private joke about this campaign of benign theft, this surreptitious con veyance of the arts over the Alps into England under the auspices of Mer cury the god of thieves. But without trying to read too far between the lines, the message becomes clear enough. The arts of Italy will arrive covertly in England because they will be tacitly introduced through the theatre; they will infiltrate or insinuate themselves; they will civilize and instruct by stealth. 3 COPYING Jones accomplished his mission through the whole range of his work. His most public intervention was his architecture, and his official title from 1615 was Surveyor of the King's Works. But his key activity was bound to 35 Vitruvius, On Architecture, ed. and trans. Frank Granger (2 vols, London and Cambridge, Mass., 1931-4), I.i. 13 (vol. I, 18-19): 'For an architect ought to be and can be no critic like Aristar chus, yet not without culture; no musician like Aristoxenus, yet not without knowledge of music; no painter like Apelles, yet not unskilled with his pencil; no sculptor like Myron or Polyclitus, yet not ig norant of the plastic art; nor in fine a physician like Hippocrates, yet not unskilled in medicine; nor in other sciences excelling in a singular manner, yet in these not unskilled.' Anthony Johnson demonstrates that Jones even goes beyond the Vitruvian model of the architect as polymath, accept ing the more exacting demands of the architect Pythius, which Vitruvius is modifying in his account: see A. W. Johnson, 'Angles, Squares, or Roundes': Studies in Jonson's Vitruvianism, D.Phil, thesis (Oxford, 1987), 53-6, 104, 470 n. 62.</page><page sequence="11">Inigo Jones and Renaissance art 255 be his designing of the masques, which began earlier (in 1605) and was more intensively focused, in the restricted but crucially influential circle of the court. He used the masques to represent Renaissance art to the leaders of taste, and his method was simply to copy. Nearly all the surviv ing masque designs have identifiable sources, which cover an almost encyclopaedic range. These are not only Italian, but also French, Nether landish and German; and they are not only stage designs, but prints of architecture, sculpture and painting, as well as original paintings and drawings.36 By casting his net so widely Jones was familiarizing the Stuart court with the whole repertory of images, styles and visual conventions which had long been established on the continent. Over a period of thirty-five years he staged this repertory before the courtiers' eyes - recapitulating a development of nearly two centuries - his aim being to naturalize Renaissance art in England once for all. The idea that the Renaissance tradition could be seen as unfolding in a great theatre occurred to Carlo Ridolfi, and he expresses it in a way which coincidentally illuminates Jones's efforts. Looking back from the seven teenth century over the great age of Venetian painting, he appeals to his readers' sense of its unequalled achievements, 'the last century having been a very theatre, and its scenery the choicest wonders of art . . ,'37 Jones's method of copying has not always been understood by modern scholars. The crux of the matter has been well expressed by John Newman: 'Jones's artistic career was ... a sustained campaign to educate his compatriots in the appreciation and understanding of the visual arts. Had he been less a copyist he would have been a less sure teacher . . ,'38 Roy Strong on the other hand sees Jones's copying not as self-conscious and systematic but as opportunistic: 'Jones was a relentless plagiarist, a magpie artist who lifted from a multiplicity of sources ideas for scenery and costumes.'39 Perhaps these explanations are not so far apart. Both have a central motif in common: they see Jones as compulsive, in com plementary ways, acting on the compulsion to acquire material and then to impart it.

It matters also that his stage designing had a long history, and its educational possibilities may not have been as clearly formulated in the earlier phases as they were later. When in 1632 he writes in an aside 'and indeed these shows are nothing else but pictures with light and motion',40 he implies casually that he had always thought of the masques as pictorial exhibitions, but this may be to some extent a retrospective rationalization. But to call him a plagiarist seems wrong, for two reasons. In practical terms, plagiarism is a way of economizing effort, and Jones's adaptations of a vast range of sources must have involved a great expense of effort. And in historical terms the concept itself may be rather misleading. The criticism is reiterated in Orgel and Strong's edition of the masque designs. Noting that many set designs of the 1630s are taken from Floren tine sources, they speak of a 'declining originality of vision'.4' Here are two fundamental misconceptions. One is that Jones's copying varied in degree at different stages of his career, when it was in fact consistent. The other is that 'originality of vision', a favourite (and perhaps mistaken) idea of our post-Romantic culture, could mean much for an artist of the early seventeenth century. The greatest artist of Jones's time, Rubens, was an avid student of ancient and modern art, assimilating a vast range of it into his own work (and he habitually retouched drawings by Cinquecento painters with no apparent sense of trespassing on their 'originality'). In this respect the exceptional figure is typical. Works which Jones copied had sometimes themselves been copied from other works; for example, his drawing of Atlas in Coelum Britannicum (1634) (fig. 1) is copied from Francesco Albani (fig. 2), who had in turn based his image on a well known antique sculpture, the Atlante Farnese (also copied by Annibale Carracci in the Camerino Farnese).42 The engravings which he frequently used were used equally by other artists: for example, the prints of Roman ruins by Hieronymus Cock and Battista Pittoni were copied not only by Jones but by Veronese in the frescos at Maser;43 etchings by Paul Bril and Callot which he copied were reworked as paintings by Pozzoserrato and Teniers.44 Sometimes he knew that a particular motif had been copied by 40 O &amp; S, II, 480, lines 49-50. 41 O &amp; S, i, 41. 42 O &amp; S, il, no. 280, 566, 588; James Byam Shaw, Old Master Drawings from Chatsworth (Lon don, 1973), 18, no. 12 (plate 12); Donald Posner, Anniabale Carracci (2 vols, London, 1971), I, 81, ii, 39-40, no. 92 (plate 92c). 43 Konrad Oberhuber, 'Hieronymus Cock, Battista Pittoni und Paolo Veronese in Villa Maser', Munuscula disciplinorum.

Inside this context he evolved his own specialized project, in which copying becomes a method or system. Even here he was not wholly un usual. Jill Finsten has shown that Isaac Oliver, who was associated with Jones in the service successively of the Earl of Rutland, Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry, was engaged on a similar programme of work.46 Oliver produced not only the portrait miniatures for which he is famous but a series of much more elaborate compositions - some limnings, the majority finished drawings - in which he adopts the characters of various con tinental artists, often mingling different styles in the same composition. The result is a corpus of work in which the whole gamut of continental Mannerist styles is self-consciously represented. These drawings were ap parently done for a small circle of court patrons prepared to appreciate their sophisticated representation of new aesthetic styles.47 Oliver's activity here is a more refined, circumscribed version of Jones's dissemination to the court in general of the broadest range of continental art. Both Oliver and Jones must have been aware that they were doing similar things. Each had started from the same point. There was no one in England to teach them about continental art, so that pastiche and copying became necessary means of self-education. They capitalized by 46 Jill Finsten, Isaac Oliver.

The idea of copying as an activity which was formative for the artist was sanctioned by the artistic tradition which Jones and Oliver were try ing to introduce. The sanction was ambiguous, since the increasing volume of theoretical writing which had appeared in Italy by the turn of the sixteenth century did not produce a consensus on the point. The prac tices of copying as a means of learning or developing one's metier, and of following the ancients (and moderns) as a way of generating new work, had come to overlap with the imitation of the 'great masters' of the Cin quecento in pursuit of a beautiful style or maniera; as Jones wrote, paraphrasing Vasari, 'gudd manner corns by Copiinge ye fayrest thinges'.48 The resulting problems are most readily displayed in the case of Michelangelo, whose deification turned him for many lesser artists into a monstre sacré. Vasari's life records him as an apprentice copying a com plicated engraving by Schongauer, making deceptively perfect copies of 'various old masters', and drawing Masaccio's frescos in the Brancacci Chapel.49 A later round-up of anecdotes includes his attacks on derivative artists, especially a sculptor who claimed to have imitated and surpassed antique statues: '"One who follows others never surpasses them, and an artist who cannot do good work of his own is unable to use that of others to advantage."'50 There is a clear distinction in the narrative between learning from others' work and learning to use others' work. In fact the quotation goes back to Quintilian, and restates a classic topos about prac tising imitation in order to be oneself. But this issue became confused by the overbearing example of Michelangelo's achievement, reinforced by Vasari's deification, so that in the second edition of the Lives Vasari is forced to complain of all the artists who follow Michelangelo in a slavish and inept fashion.51 The cult of greatness and the Vasarian myth that art had reached its apogee threatened to compromise modern artists' im itative relationship with their predecessors. The problem is acknowledged in Lomazzo's Idea del tempio della pit tura (1591), where the painter, advised to learn by drawing on the work of the best artists, is also warned not to go against the grain of his own 48 In his copy (in Worcester College library) of Vasari, Delle Vite De' Piu Eccellenti Pittori Scultori Et Architettori. . .

The difficulty here is spelt out more obviously in G. B. Armenini's treatise De' veri precetti della pittura (1586, reprinted 1587). This book was in Lord Arundel's library,53 and it is very likely Jones knew it. Certainly his drawing practice follows exactly the pattern recommended by Armenini. The beginner is told to copy 'parts of the human body . . . drawn by an experienced hand with thin and easy strokes', and to go on to copying engravings. More sophisticated exercises which Armenini approves are copying the pseudo-antique frescos of Polidoro da Caravaggio, and draw ing figures from the Last Judgement.54 All these exercises are exemplified in Jones's Roman Sketchbook.55 Moreover, the whole problem of systematic copying as part of an artist's oeuvre - as distinct from just an instrument in his early training - is canvassed by Armenini in ways which are pertinent to Jones's situation. Armenini distinguishes between two kinds of artists who borrow from the work of others. There are 'those who because of their poor intellect lack inventiveness', who are advised 'that as long as they have good judg ment, they can skilfully help themselves with the devisings of others without incurring censure'. But in using others' inventions one has to 'adapt them with some changes and [have] the ability to make them ap pear as if born of, and created by, one's own mind'.56 By contrast, there is the way to 'una bella e dotta maniera', 'whereby we become so skilled and develop such a firm style through imitation of masterpieces that we can render another's figures so that they appear as our own'.57 Armenini's ex ample of the second type is Perino de Vaga, who left behind a huge reper tory of copies - after engravings, the paintings of Raphael, and nudes 52 Paola Barocchi, Scritti d'arte del Cinquecento (Turin, 1979), vn.i, 1598. 53 BM MS Sloane 862, 'Catalogus librorum bibliothecae Norfolcianae', fol. 20 verso, no. 204 (Armenini comes between Vasari and Lomazzo). 54 G.

The moral is plain: 'once we have acquired our own beautiful style, we can facilely use another's inven tions and make them our own with little effort, thus winning honour and risking no censure'.58 The terms of Armenini's descriptions fail to uphold his distinction be tween the superior and the intrinsically inferior type of artist. We can sup pose that a painter of 'poor intellect' would be nowhere near as good as Perino in practice, but in theory they seem identical, making the inven tions of others appear to be their own, in a spirit of ingenious oppor tunism. Part of the problem lies in the concept of 'invention' itself, which of course denotes the finding of material, not its origination. A licentious interpretation of the concept could open the way to sheer opportunism. This is what Castiglione seems to be recommending when, basing himself on aesthetic theory, he says that the perfect courtier, in composing together the various graces of his behaviour, should 'steal' them from people who are appropriate models. In his case one has to allow for a cer tain self-conscious irony, the typical sprezzatura, since he uses a 'stolen' analogy to make the point and lets it be noticed;59 but the idea of inven tion through theft is logical enough. What makes a difference is the whole context in which the concept of invention operates. Here, according to Armenini, the historical situation has changed, and the artist's invention can only work under difficulties: 'Since, now, as many believe, it is im possible to create anything which has not already been found and made, it follows that one can and must use another's inventions, provided one takes care to adapt them with some changes and has the ability to make them appear as if born of, and created by, one's own mind.'60 This sentence occurs in his advice to the artist of 'poor intellect', but it describes a general crisis for all artists, and, as we have seen, recommends a method identical to that ascribed to Perino, the superior artist of an earlier age. Armenini's argument is certainly not consistent, but what he is saying becomes plain enough: that copying, which was once customary for the novice and an option for the master, is now for the modern artist inevitable. 58 Ibid. 136; 65: 'alcuni ignudi del giuditio, i quali dissegni si vedevano essere con tal'arte ridotti alla sua dolce maniera, che si potea dir più tosto quelli esser da lui nati, e trovati, che ritratti da altrui . . . si conchiude alla fine, che presa che si hà la bella maniera, si puö servire con facilité delle cose altrui, &amp; con poca fatica adoperarle; corne sue proprie, &amp; farsi honore senza riportarne biasimo da niuno.' 59 II cortegiano, ch. xxvi, quoted in Barocchi, as note 52, 1532 and note 3. 60 Armenini, True Precepts, 149; Veri Precetti, 78: 'percioche essendo impossibile, sî come pare à molti, di poter formarsi hoggimai cosa, la quai prima non sia stata trovata, &amp; fatta, ne seguita, che il servirsi delle altrui inventioni si possa, &amp; sia necessario, pur che si habbia avertimento di ridurle con qualche mutatione, &amp; tenere una certa facoltà, che paiano esser nate, &amp; fabricate per suo pro prio ingegno . .</page><page sequence="18">262 John Peacock The conclusion to be drawn from his discussion - that copying is not just formative for the artist but inevitably constitutive of his work - could be seen as underwriting Jones's practice as a copyist, including the am biguity of that practice. Because Armenini's argument is inconsistent it produces a kind of anamorphosis, in which Jones can be seen either as a typical artist of the modern epoch or an opportunist of 'poor intellect' in geniously compensating for his deficiencies. This suggestive image perhaps shows us Jones in his historical situation. But it cannot take ac count of his peculiar geographical situation, and it now needs to be com pared with Jones's picture of himself. 4 THE MOTTO Jones's idea of himself as one who learned to be an artist through copying is expressed in his motto, 'Altro diletto che imparar not trovo'. He took this from Daniele Barbara's commentary on Vitruvius. Barbara is discuss ing the intellectual qualities required for the practice of art in the Aristotelian sense, and the pleasure which the products of art give to the intellect: the pleasure of the intellect is to apprehend what is true, for nothing is more fitting to the intellect than truth, hence the saying: Altro diletto ch'imparar non trovo.61 The specific source of this Aristotelian dictum is the fourth chapter of the Poetics, which, before the detailed discussion of poetry as mimesis, pro pounds the fundamental existence of the mimetic instinct and the pleasure of learning through imitation: the instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood, one dif ference between him and other animals being that he is the most im itative of living creatures, and through imitation learns his earliest lessons, and no less universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated . . . to learn gives the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers but to men in general; whose capacity, however, of learning is more limited.62 This passage, like much of the Poetics, was endlessly reproduced by sixteenth-century Italian theorists. The last part is paraphrased by Min turno as follows: Nè già per altro, se non che pur i Philosophi, ma ciascuno altro mag gior diletto, che imparar non prova . . ,63 61 I Died Libri DellAr chit ettura Di M. Vitruvio, Tradol ti &amp; commentati da Möns.

Why should Jones have turned to the Aristotelian theory of poetry in order to express a central conviction about himself as a visual artist? His rupture with Ben Jonson about the relative importance of poetry and 'pic ture' in the masques may make the question look more difficult than it is. Long before that, at the beginning of his employment by Queen Anne, he had to design three plays at Oxford; and he may have read Aristotle, and a modern Aristotelian such as Minturno (whose treatise contains a great deal on 'poesia scenica') for guidance about principles. Vitruvius had said the architect should be familiar with 'lettere', a point reinforced and elaborated by Barbara.64 But whatever prompted him to read the Poetics or texts based on it, the general situation of the arts in this period meant he would have inevitably become familiar with Aristotelian poetic theory. In a classic study, Rensselaer Lee has shown how the Poetics, along with Horace's Ars poetica were appropriated by theorists of visual art in order to supply the absence of any comparable treatise on art surviving from antiquity. Aristotle's theory of mimesis, which he had expounded in any case partly through analogies with painting, became a particularly impor tant doctrine in art theory of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.65 Jones's contemporary Franciscus Junius begins The Painting of the An cients as a matter of course with 'a generali observation of the inbred delight men take in the imitation of the workes of Nature . . .',66 and this approach is typical of Italian writers of previous generations. It is not sur prising that Jones should have used the theory of mimesis to express the essential point of his own work. So the motto 'Altro diletto che imparar non trovo' characterizes Jones as an imitator. This may be understood in two senses. Vasari explains: I know that our art consists entirely of imitation, first of Nature, and then, as it cannot rise so high of itself, of the things which are produced by those who are acknowledged the greatest masters.67 This expresses succinctly the sophistication of Aristotle's concept made by later writers of antiquity: that in order to imitate Nature one also has to imitate art. The first kind of imitation (mimesis) entails the second (imitatio). Vasari's claim that art 'consists entirely' of imitation in this complex sense is borne out later, when he defines the term 'disegno': 64 Barbaro, Vitruvius, as note 61, 12. 65 Rensselaer W. Lee, Ut Pictura Poesis: The Humanistic Theory of Painting (New York, 1967), 66 Franciscus Junius, The Painting of the Ancients (London, 1638), 2. 67 Vasari, Milanesi, I, 222: 'io so che Tarte nostra è tutta imitazione della natura principalmente, e poi, perché da sè non puö salir tanto alto, delle cose che da quelli che miglior maestri di sè giudica sono condotte . .</page><page sequence="20">264 John Peacock Il disegno fu lo Imitare il piu bello délia natura in tutte le figure, cosi scolpite, come dipinte, la quai parte viene dallo haver la mano, e l'ingegno, che rapporti tutto quello, che vede l'occhio in sul piano . . . Jones underlined the first term and paraphrased: 'what desine is To Imitate ye best of nature'.68 Since 'design' is Vasari's most inclusive concept - painting, sculpture and architecture being for him the 'arti del disegno' - to equate imitation with it is to stress the inclusiveness of that concept too. Ben Jonson complained in his Expostulation that the idea of 'design' was 'Omnipotent' for Jones;69 by analogy we may deduce from his motto that imitation is an equally powerful motif in his thinking (Jonson could never have mocked at that because it was at the centre of his own work).70 5 IMITATION In this context of thought, the masque designs, which are 'copied', are much closer to Jones's architecture, which is 'original', than our anachronistic discourse of originality and copying can convey. Both could come under the rubric of imitation. According to Jones's mentor Palla dio, architecture, like all the other arts, was 'imitatrice della natura'; 71 and Alberti and Barbara had maintained the same point. The argument was that architecture operated according to 'the laws upon which she [Nature] herself acted in the Production of her Works',72 the Aristotelian view being that art imitated Nature's modus operandi. Other writers rein forced this argument by seeing quasi-representational elements in classical buildings. Vitruvius had derived the concept of proportion in ar chitecture from the model of the human body.73 Vasari, in describing a 68 Vasari, as note 48, ibid. : 'Design was the imitation of the most beautiful aspects of nature in all figures, whether sculpted or painted - a capacity which comes from having a hand and intellect able to reproduce everything that the eye sees on a level surface . . 69 D.

He wrote that columns, in thickness, 'ought ... to imitate the natural growth of trees'; this is repeated by Palladio and Sir Henry Wotton.78 On a smaller scale, Jones himself writes on an illustration in his Palladio that the ovolo of the Temple of Neptune 'imitates the almond rather than the chestnut'.79 From the most general and abstract down to the most detailed and naturalistic level, architec ture imitated nature. Appropriately then, one occurrence of Jones's motto is in his copy of Barbaro's Vitruvius.80 Quite apart from the fact that he discovered it in Barbaro's text, its implication about learning through imitation chimes with the idea that the architect imitates nature. Barbaro explains how this is: Art as far as it can imitates nature; and this comes about because the motive principle of art, which is the human intellect, is very similar to the motive principle of nature, which is also an intelligence. From the similarity of powers and principles springs a similarity in the modus operandi - which for the moment we may call 'imitation'.81 This can be compared with Jonson's description of the first scene in his and Jones's first masque, The Masque of Blackness (1605): an artificiall sea was seene to shoote forth, as if it flowed to the land, raysed with waues, which seemed to moue, and in some places the 74 Vasari, Milanesi, I, 146. 75 Haydocke, Lomazzo, as note 16, i, 26. 76 Vitruvius, as note 35, IV.i.6-7 (i, 206-7). 77 Vasari, Milanesi, I, 130: '[ha] forma somigliante, come si dice, alia persona di Ercole . . .' 78 Vitruvius, as note 35, v.i.3 (i, 256-7): 'Non minus quod etiam nascentium oportet imitari naturam, ut in arboribus . . .'; Palladio, as note 71, I, 51; Sir Henry Wotton, The Elements of Architecture (London, 1624), 32. 79 Note on IV, 132; see Bruce Allsopp (ed.), InigoJones on Palladio (2 vols, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1970).

The implications for Jones are obvious: whether as architect or masque designer he is an artist in the full Aristotelian sense, a fundamental imitator of nature. His own interest in the theory, as well as the practice, of mimesis is documented in his copy of Plato's Republic. He chooses three sections for continuous comment, all dealing with art as mimesis: in Book 3, the discussions of narration and dramatization in poetry, and of music; in Book 10, the famous attack on art because its mimetic method ensures its estrangement from the truth. While following Plato's account of music with sympathetic attention, Jones stands back from his critical argument in the other two passages. In Book 3, when Socrates maintains that the dramatic element in poetry must be minimized because its essentially mimetic quality represents both good and evil impartially, Jones simply notes the technical distinctions he makes: 'what poesi is Imitation . . . what poesie is not Imitation . . . narration in prose no immitation';83 but he refrains from endorsing the conclusion. He Aristotelianizes the passage, as it were, reading from it the contrasting analysis of narration and dramatization that was to be elaborated in the Poetics. He follows the condemnation of art in Book 10 in an even more detached spirit. Homer is challenged to show the practical effect of his representations of the world: Be so good as to tell me, what city was ever better governed and ordered through your example, as Sparta was by the methods of Lycur gus, and many cities both great and small have been by the methods of many other men? Of what city do men proclaim you to be an excellent lawgiver? Jones, less docile than the usual Platonic interlocutor, answers back: 'I think that Homer taught lawgivers.'84 When Socrates declares, I said that painting, and every kind of imitation, operates at a great distance from truth; and again, it relates to that part of us which is especially devoid of prudence, and allies itself to that, having no par ticle of truth or honesty, 82 H &amp; S, vu, 170, lines 26-30. 83 La Republica di Platone, trans.

Plato's account of mimesis clearly compelled his attention, but in the end he subscribed to Aristotle's more positive view, as reinterpreted in the Renaissance, that art productively and truly imitates nature. But in order to imitate nature he was, in both the fields of architecture and stage design, an imitator of art. Jones's ideas as an architect on using the work of others are revealingly documented in his notes of Palladio. In those notes, made over many years,86 the most frequently recurring phrase is the recommendation, addressed to himself, 'to be imitated'. Occasionally this refers to solving a practical problem, such as the placing of stairs or the extension of columns which are too short.87 But usually it refers to a formal solution. Sometimes it occurs in the negative, 'not to be imitated', and then Jones states his criteria of judgement. On one of Palladio's illustrations of the Temple of Nerva Traiano, detailing the order of the portico, he writes: 'noat that thes cartouses answear not to the floure of the Capitell no nor the spases this is not to be Imitated'.88 That is, the modilions in the cornice are not spaced out symmetrically in relation to the columns, so that neither a modilion nor one of the intervals between them lines up with the rosette of the Corinthian capital. He even criticizes the Pantheon: 'Noat the ribes of this volte answears with nothing below yt not to be Imitated.'89 What is required is an utterly consistent demonstra tion of the overall system of relationships which constitutes a building. The fundamental test of this consistency is revealed in another note, on the unusual Corinthian capital of an antique temple: noat the clothing of the Cauliculi with leaves whos branch beares up the rosse a dilicatt invention and sheaues thatt which is doon by reason and is gratious through yt vary from the useuall way, is good and to be folloed.90 The aesthetic novelty has a rational point. All these formal choices, even the smallest, must depend on reason. Reason brings us back to Aristotle. In his copy of the Ethics, Jones wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle's definition of an art: 'Arte is the Habbit to do a thing with right reason.'91 His principle for selecting what features 85 Ibid. 421-2: 'io dicevo che la pittura, et ognifacoltà dell' imitare, esercita l'opera sua lontano délia verità, et di nuovo si accosta con qualche parte di noi, la quale del tutto sia priva di prudentia, &amp; con quella fa amicitia, ma non ha cosa veruna di vero, ne di sincero' (Jones's underlining). 86 John Newman, 'The dating of Inigo Jones's annotations', in Essays presented to Peter Murray (unpublished London University typescript, 1980).

He practises the secondary type of imitation strictly as a means to the primary type of imitation. The rationale of the rigorous doctrine of imita tion which emerges from Jones's notes is to be found in their main subject, Palladio. One major theme of the notes is Palladio as an imitator, usually of the ancients. Jones pinpoints details of Palladio's versions of the orders, as well as of his buildings, which are taken from the antique; he even notes borrowings which go to make up Palladio's reconstructions of an tique temples. The implicit criteria of these imitations are spelt out in Palladio's chapter (i.xx) 'De gli Abusi'. His catalogue of 'abuses', archi tectural solecisms and improprieties, depends on the initial argument that since architecture imitates nature, it cannot sanction departures from what is natural. Palladio's idea of what is natural follows Vitruvius, who maintains that, since stone superseded wood as a building material, the ornaments of the classical orders are representations in stone of features which originally were the result of timber construction.92 (The point is illustrated in a woodcut of Rusconi, whose treatise was in Jones's library.)93 This means that ornament has to keep in touch with its 'natural' origins, and cannot be varied or altered in ways which go against the logic of its imitative function. Palladio also follows Vitruvius in extend ing this concept of nature back from the material realm to the organic, and sees columns as imitating the growth of trees.94 He sums up this way of thinking by an appeal to the 'simplicity' of nature's creative method, and insists that to depart from this natural simplicity is to depart from the 'vero, buono, e bel modo di fabricare'.95 One senses behind Palladio's limpid authoritarianism an empathetic, almost animistic, feeling for natural materials and forms which comes appropriately from an architect who began life as a stone-mason and whose sensitivity in the placement of buildings on the natural terrain is perhaps unparalleled. Jones probably responded more readily to Palladio's idea of nature than to his feeling for it - the idea of nature's rational simplicity as a guiding concept for the ar chitect in his choice of motifs 'to be imitated'. The masque designs may seem at first to be in a different universe from Jones's architecture, especially if we see that as stressing the abstract rather than the sensuous qualities of Palladio's work. There is no obvious sign of that rapprochement between architecture and the theatre to be seen in the work of some Italian contemporaries; Giulio Parigi, for one, seems in some respects a much more 'theatrical' architect.96 But Jones's notes, again, on the topic of imitation suggest the opposite. One of these Palladio, as note 71, I, 51-2; Vitruvius, as note 35, IV.ii.3-5 (i, 215-17). G. A. Rusconi, Delia Architettura (Venice, 1590), 75; King's Arcadia, 219. See back note 78.

Jones did imitate this invention, but it was in a masque set, not a building - the Roman Atrium for the first scene of Albion's Triumph (1632) (fig. 4), a meticulously detailed architectural perspective.98 Jones evidently did not think of architecture and masques as discontinuous; and this is quite logical, considering that each involves imitation, not only in being mimetic of nature, but in imitating prior works of art. The way in which each structures its imitations increases the similarity. Yet another of Jones's notes discusses how Palladio has formulated his ver sions of the orders from a wide range of differing antique examples, with particular reference to the pedestals of columns: But in my opinion Palladio Immitates the Best Bacments of thes anti quities as the Tempels of Pola, of Nerva, of Fortune, of Scicci, but allwaes the libberty of composing with reason is not taken awaye but who followes the best of the ansientes cannot much earr." Reason, as we have seen, is the standard of nature, so again it seems that to follow the ancients is to be on the way to following Nature. But more pertinent here is that the architect's scope for invention is precisely delimited: at its widest it is 'the liberty of composing with reason'. When Jones talks of 'composing' he is referring to the constituent elements of the classical orders, each formal motif being susceptible of variation, and all together susceptible of different combinations and recombinations, sub ject to certain conventions or rules. 'Composing' is what the architect does with the basic formal vocabulary in order to produce his own inventions, and to realize a project, which may be an actual building or a paper pro ject like Palladio's reconstructions of antique temples - or something in between like Jones's masque architecture. Since the formal language exists already only by virtue of the many authoritative 'compositions' made from it by the ancients, any use of it is bound to be a reuse. 'Com posing' is tantamount of 'following'. 97 Note on iv, 14. 98 Newman, as note 38, 559.

In the Preface to the Lives he follows its vicissitudes in the period of decline, between the era of Con stantine and the mid-thirteenth century, noting that alone of all the arts it kept up a certain competence: Architecture . . . maintained its excellence at a higher though not at the highest level. Nor is this a matter for surprise, since large buildings were almost entirely constructed of spoils, so that it was easy for the ar chitects in great measure to imitate the old in making the new, since they had the former continually before their eyes.100 Vasari names a long series of buildings, from the Arch of Constantine to the Duomo of Pisa, which he sees as 'constructed of spoils'. He praises some of them, quite logically, since they carry the compositional method of classical architecture to its logical extreme. They are reconstituting the authoritative works of the ancients, not just figuratively but literally. Jones seems to have taken in Vasari's view of post-antique architecture as a literal remaking of the antique, since he used it to argue against Palladio in one of his notes.101 And his sense of how it points up the fun damental but complex importance of 'composing' in architecture is seen in his design for Temple Bar. This is an imitation of the Arch of Constan tine, and as if recognizing Vasari's view of the Arch as 'constructed of spoils', Jones's project follows suit, incorporating sculptured panels derived from a variety of other sources.102 Jones's imitation of a pastiche is logi cally also a pastiche, and self-consciously reinforces the intrinsically im itative nature of architectural 'composing'. It is through 'composing' in this sense that the masque designs are generated. Taking as their field of reference modern art - that is, the arts from the High Renaissance onwards seen as reviving the excellencies of antiquity - together with antique art as reproduced by modern artists, they treat this vast stock of motifs as a formal vocabulary, to be used in almost endless recombinations. The perspective provided by Vasari, like that we considered earlier provided by Armenini, helps to express the am biguity of this enterprise. From one point of view the designs could be 100 Vasari, Milanesi, I, 225; 'L'architettura ... si andô mantenendo, se non cos! perfetta, in miglior modo: nè di ciö è da maravigliarsi, perche, facendosi gli edifizi grandi quasi tutti di spoglie, era facile agli architetti nel fare i nuovi imitare in gran parte i vecchi, che sempre avevano dinanzi agli occhi . . .' 101 Note on the Baptistery of Constantine, IV, 61: 'Paladio thinkes this Tempi not Antike but I do Beeleeve yt to bee made in Constantines time when Architecture was much falen and they yoused to build wth fragmentes of Antike buildinges as in his Arch, se Serlio.' Serlio's account of the Arch of Constantine in Book m does not contain what Jones referred to: he may have written Serlio in mistake for Vasari. 102 The roundels are derived from Roman medals, such as Jones would have known in the Royal Collection: King's Arcadia, 143, 67; cf. Antonio Agostini, Dialoghi Intorno alle Medaglie (Rome, 1625), 76 (medals inscribed 'Hilari Tempor' and 'Hilaritas' cf. Jones's 'Laetitia Publica'), 32, 41 ('Pietas' and 'Pax Augusti' cf. Jones's 'Hylaritas Publica').</page><page sequence="28">272 John Peacock seen as 'constructed of spoils'. From another they could be seen as adopt ing the paradigm of invention underlying architectural classicism - of art as imitative 'composing' - and taking it to its logical conclusion in the genre of 'picture'. Certainly there is a parallel between the kind of minute attentiveness which Jones's architectural notes record, and the same methodical acuity displayed by his masque compositions. In annotating Palladio, he shows an extraordinary capacity for singling out and com paring tiny details, always in an appropriate general context; and the notes contain an elaborate network of cross-reference. Like Palladio - like any classical architect - he is acutely aware of parts, both analytically and synthetically. This comes out also in the masque designs, which often reveal a careful visual analysis of their sources, going beyond the need to rearrange visual 'spoils'. Armenini had written that imitation is nothing more than the practice of observation; Franciscus Junius took this further, and declared that imitation was essentially an analytical disci pline.103 This is certainly true of Jones, both as architectural thinker and masque designer, engaged in 'composing with reason'. Jones's self-characterization as an imitator, in the motto which he discovered and inscribed in his Vitruvius, helps us to shake off the bugbear of 'originality' and appreciate how the masque designs are pro duced according to the same general principles as the architecture. And to see his copying in the masques in the context of 'imitation' is not only to understand them better as works in themselves, but also as a means to an end - the end of training himself and educating his audience, both being in effect one and the same process. 103 Armenini, True Precepts, 130; Vert Precetti, 61; Junius, as note 66, 33, 35: 'a good Imitator standeth in need of learned and well exercised eyes; not onely, because hidden things cannot be seen unlesse they are first searched out; but also, because the things apparant are very often so cunningly contrived and joyned, that none but quick-sighted Artificers and teachers can perceive them'.</page></plain_text>
