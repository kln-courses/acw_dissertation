<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Paul II and Cooperation with God Edward Vacek, SJ. Christians commonly assert, "Good works are not done by us; they are done by God, and in spite of us." This biblically inspired sentiment is thought to glorify God; but it eviscerates Christian ethics. By contrast, many secular persons today say, "We do good works; we do them without God and in spite of culture." This view glorifies the autonomous human person; but it eviscerates Christian ethics. The challenge set by these competing views is to hold together both human and divine agency, both autonomy and divine sovereignty, both ethics and faith.1 Christian ethicists ask how this world and the kingdom of God are related, seeking neither to identify them nor to make them extrinsic to one another. The writings of John Paul II address such questions. He envisions Christian life in the world as a form of cooperation with God.2 The aim of this paper is to organize and critically evaluate this theological vision.3 I quote extensively from the pope's works in order to indicate as exactly as possible his views. Where illuminating, I also refer to the prepapal writings of Karol Wojtyla. I will consider four objections to the idea of "co-creation," and I will offer a constructive response to this criticism. I will try to show that the evolving papal writings offer an incomplete, but worthy vision of the unity of the divine and human. John Paul's Gospel of Human Activity For John Paul, the Church is centered on both God and human beings. "In Jesus Christ, every path to man ... is simultaneously an approach to the Father and his love. . . . The more the church's mission is centered upon man—the more it is, so to speak, anthropocentric—the more it must be confirmed and actualized theocentrically."4 For John</page><page sequence="2">82 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics Paul this dual center—simultaneously anthropocentric and theocentric—is crucial. Understanding this duality is one of the major theological tasks of our time. The first half of this essay begins with his concept of participation and then explores this relation to God under three aspects: God as creator, redeemer, and fulfiller. Participation John Paul regularly describes the relation between God and human beings as one of "participation," but in his papal writings he does not specify what he means by this term. He did, however, discuss it in his earlier, philosophical writings. To understand what is at stake, it is useful to consider John Mahoney*s description of two alternatives: The biblical mentality, and especially the Old Testament, is largely occasionalist, as is Augustine, attributing very little to the reality and activity of secondary causes under God, and viewing all human activity as predomi nantly the theatre of God's activity. It was Aquinas's great contribution . . . to exploit the idea of instrumental causality . . . and so to view God and man as not acting on the same plane of being, where demarcation disputes are inevitable, but on different planes of being, with God as principal agent and man as his free instrument with his own real but subordinate contribu tion to make.5 Wojtyla avoids the occasionalist position; and he normally eschews the cosmological categories of primary and secondary causality. Rather he speaks about participation in terms of interpersonal relations. For Wojtyla, participation means persons acting jointly for a common good, while at the same time fulfilling themselves as unique persons. These persons are not diminished for the sake of an external goal.6 Rather, in mutuality, otherness is preserved and greater personalization is achieved by all participants. Alienation, by contrast, means losing the experience of the other as another "I."7 All this is important when considering human participation in God. Divine/human participation is not simply one of primary/secondary causality, but rather, mutatis mutandis, one of interpersonal relations—a union or communion of persons. By "communion" Wojtyla means a personal relationship, including "the good that they do to one another, giving and receiving within the relationship."8 John Paul also uses the language of friendship and parent-child relations to describe participation.</page><page sequence="3">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 83 Persons are called through the Spirit into a personal I-Thou covenantal relation with God, and in that friendship the " 'depths of God' become in some way opened to participation on the part of man." As a result, "human life becomes permeated through participation by the divine life, and itself acquires a divine, supernatural dimension."9 For the pope, "God ... is also father; he is linked to man ... by a bond still more intimate than that of creation. It is love which not only creates the good but also grants participation in the very life of God."10 Thus John Paul depicts the divine-human relation as one of mutuality in which "God opens himself to man" and this divine self-opening "enables the human spirit to open in its turn" to God. Cosmologically based theologies are concerned to protect divine immutability. John Paul, however, uses the personalistic language of mutual self-opening and mutual responsiveness. The inner trinitarian life, he says, extends itself as divine self-giving to humans, and this in turn enables us to live expanded lives that include God's own life.11 "Image of God, " the Creator John Paul habitually turns to Genesis and the imago Dei as his starting point for his reflections on human life.12 He discusses the meaning of that canonized phrase chiefly in terms of "work" and "love." We begin with work, since John Paul—in line with his earlier philosophi cal writing—commonly emphasizes dominion over things and self-mastery as the basic meaning of imago Dei. Thus, "Man is the image of God partly through the mandate received from his creator to subdue, to dominate, the earth. In carrying out this mandate, man, every human being, reflects the very action of the creator of the universe."13 Objective Dominion: For John Paul, this dominion has both an objective and a subjective sphere.14 In its "objective" sphere, dominion refers to mastery of the "whole of the visible world." John Paul denies that human beings must submit to pre-personal structures. The pope's attitude to scientific advances is one of enthusiasm: "technology is man's ally"; it "offers hope of creating a new and better humanity"; it "will increase man's creative capacity."15 Work is the major form of dominion. In itself it is not a curse. Rather it is a "real vocation to change the world," leading to "a growing humanization of the world and its structures." Following the Genesis account which places work before the fall, John Paul insists that work "is</page><page sequence="4">84 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics a blessing from God who calls man to rule the earth and transform it, in order that the divine work of creation may continue."16 Thus God's act of on-going creation depends on the help of human beings. Speaking to Mexican workers, John Paul said both that they are collaborating with God and that "God is working with you in order that you may construct a world that is more beautiful, kind, just, human and Christian."17 Obviously, then, the pope has a religious view of work: it aids the creator in sustaining life and transforming the earth. John Paul is concerned with the theological significance of work. He seeks to uncover the "meaning which [work] has in the eyes of God." In a remarkable section entitled "Work as a Sharing in the Activity of the Creator," he lays down what he calls a fundamental truth: man, created in the image of God, shares by his work in the activity of the creator and . . . , within the limits of his own human capabilities, man in a sense continues to develop that activity, and perfects it. . . . Man ought to imitate God, his creator, in working, because man alone has the unique characteristic of likeness to God. . . . This activity by God in the world always continues. . . . Awareness that man's work is a participation in God's activity ought to permeate . . . even 'the most ordinary everyday activ Subjective Dominion: John Paul understands "subjective" or personal dominion largely in the sense of the modern concept of autonomy: " 'as the image of God' he is a person, that is to say, a subjective being capable of acting in a planned and rational way, capable of deciding about himself and with a tendency to self-realization."19 He understands this freedom as more than independence of external determination and more than the ability to decide about external courses of action. Rather freedom is fundamentally concerned with self-creativity or self-realization. Persons are those who decide about themselves. Wojtyla's central concern as a philosopher had been to develop a personalist foundation for morality. He had criticized the classical definitions of humans as "rational animals" or "individual substances of a rational nature" because these definitions describe human beings in cosmological rather than personal terms. In classical thought the uniqueness and subjèctivity of the person, its irreducibility to the level of interchangeable things, had been overlooked.20 To this European personalism Wojtyla had added a kind of American pragmatism. The medieval primacy of contemplation gives way in his</page><page sequence="5">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 85 work to the contemporary primacy of action. Human subjectivity is experienced not primarily or exclusively in consciousness, but rather in self-determining action.21 The starting point for analyzing self determination is the experience not of the "I think" but the "I do."22 There are two aspects of this doing: agency and self-determination. Agency is the "active directing of the subject towards a value"; but in self determination "he also decides about himself... he becomes his own 'maker.'. . . [SJelf-determination . . . explains ... the fact that by his actions man becomes either 'good' or 'bad."'23 For Wojtyla, then, the person is "the first and essential object of its own decisions." The proper structure of this self-determination is self-possession and self-control.24 Dominion is lost only if human beings become subordinate to their creations or if spirit loses its hegemony over matter.25 This understanding of self-determination appears in the papal writings as subjective dominion. John Paul does not, of course, accept a subjec tivism in which factors such as good intentions and strength of personal decision are the only ethically relevant factors. Still, he proposes that the chief measure of any work is the scope it gives for developing the worker: "in the final analysis it is always man who is the purpose of the work, whatever work it is that is done by man—even if the common scale of values rates it as the merest 'service,' as the most monotonous, even the most alienating work."26 Elsewhere he writes, "Work is a good thing for man . . . because through work man not only transforms nature, adapting it to his own needs, but he also achieves fulfillment as a human being and indeed in a sense becomes 'more a human being.'"27 Each exercise of dominion both confirms and further develops its very exercise.28 Thus John Paul asserts the primacy of persons over things, of ethical life over efficient life. Theologically speaking, the chief work of God on earth is person-making, and with that work of God we cooperate whenever we engage in morally good self-determination. Love: In the view of John Paul, the second major meaning of Imago Dei is the ability to love. "God created man in his own image and likeness: .. . God is love. . . . Love is therefore the fundamental and innate vocation of every human being."29 Emphasis on self-determination should not lead to egocentrism; rather, according to Wojtyla, it should enable persons disinterestedly to make a gift of themselves to others. Human self-development and self-fulfillment occur "through others."30 Thus, through their love for one another, spouses are "capable of the greatest possible gift, the gift by which they become cooperators with God</page><page sequence="6">86 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics for giving life to a new human person."31 As "cooperators in the love of God the creator," parents image God: With the creation of man and woman in his own image and likeness, God crowns and brings to perfection the work of his hands: he calls them to a special sharing in his love and in his power as creator and Father through their free and responsible cooperation in transmitting the gift of human life. . .. Thus the fundamental task of the family is to serve life, to actualize in history the original blessing of the creator—that of transmitting by procreation the divine image from person to person.32 Absent from this position is the ancient view that sexual intercourse transmits original sin. Rather, procreation is a way of cooperating with God's love by transmitting the divine image. Spousal love "is a unique participation in the mystery of life and of the love of God."33 Similarly, education of children "is rooted in the primary vocation to participate in God's creative activity."3* In this activity, parents are "collaborators with God the Teacher."35 "Image of Christ, " the Redeemer John Paul, as we have just seen, holds that "by means of work man participates in the activity of God himself, his creator" and thus imitates "Christ, the Man of Work."36 He goes on to make the bolder assertion that human beings participate in Christ's redemptive activity. It is not only God in Christ who redeems. Human beings are subordinate, but real co redeemers.37 "The work of salvation signifies a particular union with God, or rather a communion. . . . God, in his superabundant love, adopts man as his son and lives with him as a friend. Thus revelation is not only the manifestation of the mystery of God, but is also an invitation, by accepting which man participates in the work of salvation."38 In his book on Vatican II, Wojtyla had developed the position that the Christian "must not only accept the divine [salvific] mission but in some degree share in it. . . . [EJach individual is a unique, unrepeatable embodiment of the salvific [mission]."39 Christians witness to Christ, not simply by receiving God's goodness, but also by participating in Christ's redeeming activity. Redemption manifests itself in our moral activity, "where the divine and human elements merge closely together on the basis of participation in the threefold mission of Christ."40</page><page sequence="7">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 87 Redemption, for John Paul, is a new creation which is rooted in the love-covenant of the original creation.41 This covenant has some remarkable features: although Christ alone "satisfied" God's fatherhood, the God of mercy invites humans to show mercy to the Son of God, and therein lies not only a demonstration of human dignity but also "a synthesis of the whole of the Good News." Here there is no one-sided conception of Christ's mercifulness and humanity's wretchedness. In fact, John Paul insists that mercy must be founded not on inequality, but rather on a relation which respects the dignity of the other. Mercy, as modeled by the Son of God, is "bilateral and reciprocal."42 Though John Paul denies that God might suffer due to some deficiency, he draws attention to the biblical idea of a God who "feels compassion for man, as though sharing in his pain." God, he says, has an "indescribable fatherly 'pain'"; in Jesus' humanity the suffering of God is concretized; and the Spirit "will enter into human and cosmic suffering." Because of love, God suffers.43 Our participation in redemption is not confined to specifically religious contexts. Although work has been cursed since original sin, our hard labor participates in Christ's redemptive act. Sweat and toil. . . present the Christian and eveiyone who is called to follow Christ with the possibility of sharing lovingly in the work that Christ came to do. This work of salvation came about through suffering and death on a cross. By enduring the toil of work in union with Christ crucified for us, man in a way collaborates with the son of God for the redemption of humanity... . The Christian finds in human work a small part of the cross of Christ and accepts it in the same spirit of redemption in which Christ accepted his cross for us.44 Similarly, individual suffering may share in Christ's redemption. Human suffering completes what is lacking in the redemptive sufferings of Christ (Col. 1:24)* Toil and suffering are not the only way to share in redemption. For example, parents continue the saving mission of Christ. As "the first heralds of the Gospel for their children, . .. they become fully parents, in that they are begetters not only of bodily life but also of the life that through the spirit's renewal flows from the cross and resurrection of Christ."*6 Absent here is the older view that, while parents bring forth the bodies of their children, only God can bring forth the religious dimensions of life. John Paul praises the "spiritual fecundity" of the family and thereby underscores Vatican II's claim that the family is a</page><page sequence="8">88 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics "small-scale church."47 Christians also contribute to redemption through love and mercy. Through God's grace, spouses practice a "love which forgives and redeems."48 Thus, the "small-scale church" shares "in the saving mission proper to the chinch." It is not only a saved community, but also a "saving community." Similarly, the whole church, by incar nating the mercy of God, will fulfill its mission "which is a sharing in and, in a sense, a continuation of the messianic mission of Christ himself."49 "Image of God, " the Fulfiller Not only does human activity participate in the creative and redemp tive activity of God, it also has eschatological significance. John Paul is careful to cite Vatican IPs qualification: "Earthly progress must be carefully distinguished from the growth of Christ's kingdom. Neverthe less, to the extent that the former can contribute to the better ordering of human society, it is of vital concern to the kingdom of God" (Gaudium et spes, 39). Concerning the objective results of human effort, the pope remarks, "Let the Christian . . . , uniting work with prayer, know the place that his work has not only in earthly progress but also in the development of the kingdom of God."50 Thus, where the Council cautiously distinguished human progress from Christ's kingdom, John Paul asserts that human work actually develops the kingdom of God.51 For John Paul, the structures of the world are not merely the stage upon which we strut while waiting for the end time; nor do our actions merely provide external support for our inner life. These structures are themselves destined to find in Christ the fullness of their own meaning. The "world itself is destined to glorify God."52 The material world, through the incarnation, has been taken up into unity with God. Christians, in other words, must be concerned not only with becoming better human beings, but also with making a richer culture and a better world because this world has a religious significance. Development of the world "fundamentally corresponds" to "the divine vocation given from the beginning to man and to woman."53 Accordingly, "The Christian family also builds up the kingdom of God in history through the everyday realities that concern and distinguish its state of life. . . . [I]n the love between husband and wife and between members of the family ... the Christian family's participation in the prophetic, priestly and kingly mission of Jesus Christ and of his church finds expression and reali zation."54</page><page sequence="9">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 89 Reflecting on the relation between eschatology and human history, the cardinal of Krakow insisted that the former does not eliminate the latter, but rather gives it a new meaning. The "Gospel message is necessarily linked with human advancement under the aspect of both development and liberation."55 Through our efforts for a more human world "runs the history of salvation in which ultimate reality takes shape."56 Wojtyla even asserts [an] elementary identity between the principal vectors of the history and evolution of the world, on the one hand, and the history of salvation on the other. The plan of salvation sinks its roots into the most real aspirations and purposes of human beings. . . . And, conversely, the true conquests of man and humanity, authentic victories in the history of the world, are also the 'substratum' of the kingdom of God on earth.57 Thus, however imperfect our successes, "nothing will be lost," and all our achievements anticipate and reflect God's kingdom. The goods we realize and the work we do "serve for the coming of the definitive kingdom, since the Lord, through his Spirit, takes them up into himself."58 In sum, embracing a transformationist view of grace,59 John Paul presents us with a Gospel of the acting person. By grace, Christians collaborate with God in creation, in redemption, and in the development of the kingdom of God. As a consequence, "one and all are called to work for the coming of the kingdom of God according to the diversity of callings and situations, charisms and ministries."60 In this process, the world itself becomes ever more human and "within the world ... the kingdom develops in which God will be definitively 'all in all.' "61 Constructive Criticism of "Co-Creation" Many Christians would not be happy with John Paul's theological vision. Oliver Williams comments, "secular progress was not always linked so intimately with the Kingdom of God."62 In what follows I will consider objections from four contemporary authors: Stanley Hauerwas, Karl Barth, David Hollenbach, and Joseph Fuchs. I cannot here develop their full positions; rather, I will use their specific critiques of co-creation to expose the strengths and weaknesses of the pope's views. I will look at two pairs of objections to the idea that human activity constitutes a way of cooperating with God. One set of objections arises from disagreement about the religious weight of mundane human activity.</page><page sequence="10">90 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics It is objected that ordinary life is not so religious as the pope construes it to be; human activity is only human. Additionally it is objected that human activity is not uniformly good, but also tragic and evil. The second set of objections focuses on the sovereignty of God. On the one hand, it is objected that in the doctrine of co-creation God's transcendence is insufficiently protected; the acts of creation, redemption, and fulfillment belong to God alone. On the other, it is objected that in co-creation human autonomy is insufficiently protected; moral reason is diminished. To each of these I will respond, arguing the following four theses: 1. John Paul has made an important theological contribution in refusing to confine God's grace to a narrow range of human activities. 2. There has been an evolution in John Paul's treatment of the problem of sinful action; his more recent writings offer a much more complex vision rich with insights about social sin and the sin of pride. 3. John Paul has made a useful contribution to the perennial problem of holding God's sovereignty in a fruitful dialectical relationship with human freedom. 4. Though John Paul's vision is not directly useful for making specific decisions because he does not give adequate weight to human reason and to the necessarily conflictual character of life, his treatment of human activity properly stresses the this-worldly character of Christian hope. Among the basic acts of God, Christian theologians include the following: God creates, preserves, guides and rules, judges, redeems, sanctifies, and brings to fulfillment. Theologians argue the meaning, relative importance, and inner relationships of these divine acts. Accordingly, different theologians develop distinctive spiritualities, i.e., ways of being and acting in response to God. The pope's spiritual doctrine emphasizes the incarnational creativity of God and human cooperation. Graced Cooperation in Mundane Actions In his essay of rejoinder, "Work as Co-Creation: A Remarkably Bad Idea," Stanley Hauerwas polemically throws into sharp relief the distinctiveness of the pope's ideas. Hauerwas's first objection is that the meaning of creation in Genesis is the exact opposite of what the pope claims. According to Hauerwas, the "good news of the creation account</page><page sequence="11">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 91 is that God completed his creation and that mankind needs do nothing more to see to its perfection. That is why God could call it good and rest—and, more importantly, invite us to rest within his completed good creation."® The contrast is clear. Hauerwas believes that we need add nothing to God's good creation. Rather, we are to be God's representa tives (Hauerwas's meaning of "image") in this outpost called the world, and our task is not to control but rather to maintain or consent to God's good order (his meaning of "dominion"). As we have seen, John Paul argues that through work a human being achieves fulfillment, shares in Christ's redemption, and builds the kingdom. Hauerwas sees three related mistakes in such a view. First, he holds that it is empirically false. While some work may have its good moments, "most work is not intrinsically fulfilling, but a necessity for survival as well as contributing to our interdependence as social beings." Secondly, moral evil is not to be found in the lack of self-fulfillment. Were this to be the case, human beings would have to find all work fulfilling, no matter how trivial or unpleasant. The most inhumane forms of work would become legitimate, if individuals could find fulfillment in them. Thirdly, and more theologically, Hauerwas insists that sin should be seen as rebellion against our status as creatures; it is thus a sin to try to make "common work" something more than common work. The Scriptures teach that work does not have any ultimate cosmic or religious meaning. Work is just work. Hauerwas reasons that to seek "greater significance" in work is an idolatrous attempt to guarantee our own significance. It is the task of the Church to offer a critique of injustice and power-relations, not to provide the "meaning of work."64 Karl Barth raises similar biblical objections. In the Hebrew Scrip tures work is a self-evident necessity of life, nothing more. Barth reproves an attempt "to ascribe the dignity of worship ... to the labours of the field and workshop and nursery." He notes that Jesus never called anyone to this sort of work; rather, he called people away from it. For Paul, the tent-maker, work has no special religious significance; it is merely a way of not depending on others for support.65 According to Barth, human beings participate in two distinct areas of God's activity. Our daily tasks, which he describes as merely peripheral, share in God's providence; service in the Church, which he calls central, shares in God's redeeming activity.66 The meaning of the former is to set humans free to participate in the latter. Creation is an external basis for covenant.67 Thus involvement in human culture is not participation</page><page sequence="12">92 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics in the divine work. "Man does not do anything special by working. . . . Nor is it God's work that he continues, completes and executes."48 As is obvious, these claims are almost exactly the opposite of those made by John Paul. The difference lies in the sharp division of mundane activity from specifically religious activity. John Paul does not allow such a division. Wojtyla had identified the key problem of contemporary Christian life as the relation between faith and moral activity. He might have framed this problem in the typical way as a problem of inducing Christians who go to church on Sunday to practice their Sunday faith during the rest of the week. He does not set the problem in that typical form; rather he worried that Catholic theology offered no religious vision of the rest of the week. The old spirituality found God at the altar or prie-dieu but left all other activities in a secular limbo. Addressing this problem, John Paul tries to uncover the religious meaning of the assembly line, laboratory, or marriage bed. As he recently wrote concerning the laity: there cannot be two parallel lives in their existence: on the one hand, the so-called "spiritual" life, with its values and demands; and, on the other, the so-called "secular" life, that is, life in a family, at work, in social relation ships, in the responsibilities of public life and in culture. . . . Every activity, every situation, every precise responsibility . . . are the occasions ordained by providence for a "continuous exercise of faith, hope and charity."49 Hauerwas objects that most human activities are in themselves trivial or inconsequential. Hauerwas correctly observes that our work helps us to survive, serve others, and overcome boredom.70 What he fails to show is why this daily arbeiten und lieben cannot also share in God's activity. Barth more wisely observes that these activities may share in God's providence. For John Paul, all these trivial, mundane tasks are the very way, insofar as they are genuinely human acts, that persons act in union with God, the incarnating Creator. Grace in a Sinful World A second objection arises from the worry that a theology which highlights cooperation with God in effect will overlook the tragic and sinful. As David Hollenbach notes, since the blessing of "co-creation" seems to fall indifferently on all human work, there is no clear way to distinguish the tares from the wheat. The idea of co-creation can "bestow</page><page sequence="13">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 93 a false aura of legitimacy on social patterns that should be challenged or simply overthrown by those who not only believe that God is creator but also that God is good."71 Hollenbach argues that the pope's thesis is "useful, but incomplete." It is useful to employ the optimistic views of the Priestly writer "to emphasize that in work human beings must remain true agents and that both the means of production and the fruit of labor are at the service of those who work." It is, however, incomplete because Genesis also contains the views of the Yah wist writer "which focus on the problematic and even sinful dimensions of human agency and human action." The Yahwist author sees harmony with the creative activity of God as much less likely than the pope portrays; rather "the overstepping of the boundary between the divine and the human," i.e., the temptation to become "like God," is the source of human failure and distorted human relations. "The potential of work, technology, culture and even religion to become sources of conflict and destruction is a leitmotif of the Yahwist narratives."72 In other words, Hollenbach holds that human activity is far more ambivalent than John Paul acknowledges. Hollenbach therefore suggests that, in face of an all but inevitable misuse of freedom, John Paul ought to be less confident of the nobility of human "dominion" and, consequently, more cautious about human collaboration with God. He fears that John Paul has resolved too easily a "deep tension between the ontological goodness of the God-created human being and the actual perversity which is written on the pages of human history."73 It is true that in his early writings, John Paul had tended to describe mainly the human capacities for good, sliding too fast over other, darker tendencies of the human heart. Following the Roman Catholic natural law tradition, he initially had reflected more along the lines of the fourth Gospel's "grace upon grace" than Paul's "sin abounding, grace more abounding." Lately, however, he has been emphasizing the latter.74 He declares that sin is "an integral part of the truth about man." He laments a growing "loss of the sense of sin." He speaks of "dark forces which are active in the world almost to the point of ruling it." He sees a new quest for omnipotence on the part of some, a new attempt to build the tower of Babel. He observes that the "consequences of sin are the reasons for division and ruptures not only in each person, but also within the various circles of a person's life."75 John Paul also emphasizes social sin in a "shattered" world. Sin is social by virtue of the solidarity wherein the sin of one affects all; it is social when it harms the neighbor or when various</page><page sequence="14">94 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics groups oppose one another as in class struggle. Although "sin in the proper sense is always a personal act," still the sinner is influenced by social structures. Those who cause or support or take advantage of such structures are guilty of sin; and those who do not work to overcome such structures, whenever they can, are also guilty.76 Some critics hold that John Paul's vision—even with attention to sin—fails to take account of the serpent's temptation, "you shall be like gods." Yet we should ask why this is a temptation. Why is it a sin for us who are made in the likeness of God to want to be like God? Why is this not a case of "Become what you are"? Since the Scriptures describe us as adopted children of God who are called to be perfect like our heavenly Parent, the desire to be like God would not seem to be itself sinful. In fact, for the pope, the meaning of grace is that God reaches out across any boundary to enable us to be like God.77 Still, for John Paul, trying to be "like God" is sinful when it is an attempt to live without limits and without relation to God. John Paul calls attention to the danger of "wishing to become like God . . . through the use of a liberty without bounds."78 John Paul, who has so often argued in favor of autonomy, warns that "Man cannot decide by himself what is good and what is evil."79 Autonomy is not a freedom to do whatever one decides, but a vocation to live responsibly in society and in history under the guidance of spiritual and religious values. For the pope, conscience reflects God's wisdom and truth; disobedience lies in the claim to be "an independent and exclusive source for deciding about good and evil."80 The crucial words here are "independent and exclusive source." Participation means life in union with God, or union in truth and love.81 Refusing this union means "closing up of human freedom" in regard to God. Thus, sin is a refusal to act in accord with this union, a refusal to cooperate. It means going it alone. People fail by attending "only to the horizontal dimension of their lives, forgetting the vertical dimension by which they would have been rooted in God, their creator and Lord."82 In so doing they set up a rivalry with God, which is a "mistaken preten sion to be 'like him.' "® Thus the sin of trying to be like God is really the attempt to be without God. This is manifestly quite different from the desire to be like God in diminishing evil and empowering the good. In sum, in his current writings John Paul does vigorously face the problem of sin. What he has not yet adequately done is bring these reflections to bear in analyzing the goodness of ordinary activities. He also has not, as we will see in the final section, adequately accounted for</page><page sequence="15">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 95 the independence of humans. But, first, we must ask whether God's own independence has been adequately affirmed. Divine Transcendence and Human Freedom Hollenbach also worries that the idea of co-creation potentially distorts our view of God. The idea allows humans to think that their deeds are indeed God's, thereby "trivializing our understanding of the creative activity of God."84 Hauerwas has an even more serious objection: not only is God's independent creativity denied, but Christ's redeeming work is also denigrated. By identifying our toil and suffering with the cross of Christ, the latter is completely misconstrued. The suffering of the cross is highly specific, "not a symbol of life's difficulties." Christ does not need our collaboration; all that is required is to "live trusting that the power of his cross is more profound than the powers of this world."85 Thereby Christians are freed to help one another, bear one another up, without needing to find any redemptive significance in what they do for one another. Barth, the neo-orthodox apostle of God's sovereignty and transcen dence, also argues that ideas of cooperation with God potentially distort our idea of God. God alone is sovereign. Any creaturely cooperation is that of a servant who acts in complete selflessness. The creature's cooperation is only an instrument used for another's purposes, not its own; it is a theatre giving God external space and time to reveal the divine glory; it is a mirror that adds nothing except distortion to the light.86 In Barth's view, the human must be completely emptied of any independence. God does God's work, and human beings respond by doing work which "corresponds to" but does not "continue" or "develop" God's action. Otherwise, Barth says, their action would be divine, not human.87 Barth's objections (though not his full theory, as we shall see) fit the occasionalist view described above: for him, the history of the covenant "is a history of divine acts and achievements, not those of the creature. In it, it is a matter of God's grace, and not of its own capacities and merits.... Grace would not be grace if it... were conditioned by a reciprocal achievement on the part of the one to whom it is addressed." Barth concludes, "A creatura mediatrix gratiarum or even corredemptrix is a self-contradiction."88 These objections, then, demand that we keep God's creative and redemptive activity independent from human action. The prefix co- thus</page><page sequence="16">96 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics fails: it confuses the divine and the human. This prefix suggests human equality with God or perhaps God's dependence on humans. As a consequence, Barth insists, human beings are not collaborators, co creators, co-saviors, or co-anything.89 Still, in his customary fashion, Barth gives back what he has first taken away. After suggesting that humans are selfless servants, instru ments, mirrors, and theatres, he admits that his images all fail because they eliminate human freedom. And so after his dialectical Nein, Barth accepts a religiously legitimated form of what he has denied: It is ... a miracle of the divine mercy that within the limits of his creaturely world there should be an activity which stands in relation to the action of the Creator and which therefore points beyond these limits, a creaturely freedom which as such can attest and reflect God's own freedom, indicate God's kingdom and fatherly providence, and therefore serve God. And it is the miracle of miracles that man may be genuinely active as a subject in this sense where God acts and speaks.90 This miracle and this miracle of miracles provide the starting point for John Paul. Barth exclaims that everything seems to argue against this miracle, but God commands it to be so.91 John Paul, whose earlier writings made free action central, presents this miracle as a fact that all creation argues for. From the point of view of John Paul, Barth's images of instrument, mirror, and theater fail from the outset to do justice to our creation in the "image of God." Recent Roman Catholic theology has argued that creation is fashioned by God in view of the incarnation and that, correlatively, because of Christ, creation is itself originally graced. "Secular" human activities are not merely peripheral conditions; in a variety of ways, sometimes dramatic, more often mundane, they may share in God's transforming creative act. This is the theological position that John Paul endorses. As Langdon Gilkey notes, there are two understandings of the kingdom that are inadequate today—both because they are undialectical. In the one, the kingdom is understood to be built by good people, while in the other, God independently establishes the kingdom. He argues that only a unity of the divine and human is adequate to a right understanding of the Christian God and a graced humanity.92 On the one hand, the kingdom springs from God's initiative; on the other, God does not and cannot save us without our cooperation.</page><page sequence="17">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 97 In his emphasis on the unity of divine and human action, John Paul tends not to stress divine transcendence. His pastoral, philosophical, and political concern has been to accent human freedom and dignity. John Paul rejects the existentialist thesis that God's lordship negates human freedom. The relation between God and human beings is not a zero-sum game; rather, the free action of one requires the free action of the other. Not only do we act in and through Christ, but the Spirit acts in and through us.93 Barth and John Paul both attempt the difficult task of affirming that God is active in the world without making God one secondary cause among others. Popular Christianity tends to make God a person like other persons. Popular atheism denies God because God is not an observable secondary cause. In his recent writings, John Paul has used some phrases that indicate that he is aware of these problems. The salvific work of Jesus, he says, has been entrusted to humanity. "Never theless, in these men and through them the Holy Spirit remains the transcendent principal agent of the accomplishment of this work in the human spirit and in the history of the world." The Spirit "blows where he wills." Humans have the power to forgive sin, but this is a power that is given by Christ and a power that presupposes and includes the saving action of the Spirit.94 These expressions, however, do not clarify more exactly how human and divine actions are related. As critics make clear, terms like co creation or participation need the via negativa or Barth's Nein. God is not properly thought of on the model of the human made "bigger and better." Terms like "Partner of the Absolute" or "co-creator" are adequate only if we emphasize that God is "Absolute" and "Creator."95 A fuller ontological explanation of divine-human participation remains to be worked out,96 as the next section also indicates. Reason and Grace in a Complex and Conflictual World Josef Fuchs's concern is in some respects the inverse of Barth's. Both insist on the difference between God and creature; therefore, both want to be very careful about asserting cooperation between God and humans. Whereas Barth fears that the notion of cooperation anthropomorphically compromises God's transcendence, Fuchs fears that anthropomorphic views of God dehumanize human life. He wants to protect human autonomy, within a theonomy. Vatican theology, he fears, at times makes</page><page sequence="18">98 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics the God with whom we cooperate simply a superior, interworldly actor to whose rights, privileges, and, especially, rules we must yield. On this view, God is not one in whom we live and have our being, but one who breathes next to us, giving us clear commands about how we are to live. Against this, Fuchs argues that God is the primary cause who lives in mystery, that humans are secondary causes who live in a complexly evolving world, and that each has its own distinctive kind of agency and authority.97 Thus, he argues, in this world humans are true agents. In moral matters, John Paul tends to understand God as a law giver.98 Sin is essentially "disobedience to God, to his law, to the moral norm he has given man."99 In moral matters, his talk about participation and communion tends to recede. In contrast Fuchs argues that if one understands God too anthropomorphically as a command-giver, one neglects the proper role of human reason in discovering what is good and in creating human structures to promote the good. Divine voluntarism or ecclesiastical positivism ensue.100 Thus, the human element in moral decision-making can get lost.101 For John Paul, "conscience is 'the voice of God.'"102 There are dangers in such a position. Persons or institutions—including the church—may claim that what they think is unqualifiedly what God is thinking. John Paul would be quick to reply that this phrase "voice of God" must be interpreted to mean that conscience is dependent on the objective moral order and on God. Rather than being a blessing on all human desires, this voice of God convinces the world of its own sin.103 However, Fuchs's point still stands, since making conscience the voice of God and insisting on submission to the moral norm does not provide any place for the proper role of our reason in discovering and creating the moral good. If we are to cooperate, we must do so in a fully human way, that means our reason must have something of its own to contribute, in however dependent a way. Our personhood is not fully engaged if all we are supposed to do is to discover some pre-existent law and then conform.104 What can be said in response to the further objection that John Paul's focus on divine involvement with the world tends to obscure other aspects of human reality, namely, the complexity and sinfulness of history? While recognizing the problem of sin and the complexities of life, the pope remains optimistic: the human person possesses a fundamental goodness "because he is the image of the creator, placed under the redemptive influence of Christ, who 'united himself in some fashion with every man,'</page><page sequence="19">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 99 and because the efficacious action of the Holy Spirit 'fills the earth.' "10S In social matters, he optimistically claims, "All that is accomplished in favor of the person is also a service rendered to society, and all that is done in favor of society redounds to the benefit of the person."106 To all of which, even a respectful critic might well respond: would that human reality were so simple. Hollenbach, a respectful critic, notes that while the pope "presents a strong case for an ethic which seeks to promote cooperation, collabora tion, solidarity and harmony between all persons," he also "de-emphasizes the conflictual elements" of life.107 Hollenbach comments that John Paul's thought lacks the categories that are necessary to guide action in non-ideal circumstances. His approach is not capable of resolving the practical ethical questions which arise in our conflict-ridden struggle.108 John Paul, who has a penchant for using broad terms such as "God's laws," "moral norm," or "truth of Man,"109 sometimes gives the impression that these terms can easily be translated into particular duties. Any doubt, e.g., about marital norms, obscures the "truth about being human." "Faith," he says, "gives [Catholics] full knowledge of God's wonderful plan."110 The theological ground for John Paul's de-emphasis of conflict and complexity can be found, I think, in his reliance on a vision of the new creation, which Genesis retrospectively and the kingdom of God pro spectively symbolizes. Thus, after disparaging the Enlightenment myth of "unlimited progress," he blesses that dream for history, now transformed through grace as part of Christian hope. His vision of a harmonious, peaceful utopia resists the suggestion of some theologians that violence or conflict has a place in present eschatologically oriented, redeemed Christian existence.111 When it comes to specific decisions, the pope's adherence to natural law ethics likewise inclines him to underestimate conflict. As we have seen, John Paul tends to translate cooperation with God who is mystery into conformity with God's master plan. For John Paul, God's laws are not some positivistically given commands; rather they are laws written in the human heart.112 However, since this law is God's good plan, it should not require conflict. The reality of sin calls not for compromise but for a return to God's harmonious plan; it calls not for strategies of conflict but for obedience to God's fulfilling law. Unfortunately, life is both more complex and conflictual. The ideal of universal harmony on earth among all creatures is—even apart from</page><page sequence="20">100 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics sin—virtually, if not also theoretically, impossible. Life contains a tragic element because we sometimes have to choose one good at the loss, even the deliberate loss, of another good. A world in which no animal or plant or virus had to be killed to foster the life of another, a world in which every legitimate human desire would be fulfilled without at the same time diminishing some legitimate desire of another, a world in which no one's advantage meant another's disadvantage: such a world is eschatologically hoped for, but impossible for this creation. Sin only exacerbates the problem. In this present world, sacrifice and compromise and conflict seem necessary for achieving the common good. Still John Paul's emphasis on proleptic eschatology is salutary. To give up hope for an eschatologically fulfilled world, or to relegate it to some time after time, would effectively suspend the on-going transforming significance of the event of Christ's life, death, and resurrection for our present life. The earthly powers of sin and death would remain dominant and victorious in this aeon. Christ would reign only in heaven. Rather, the pope rightly insists, we are already made in the image of Christ. Still, it must be added that, however ennobling this identity is, it does not eliminate our need to exercise our own independent and creative reason. Conclusion The theological issues explored in this paper are familiar ones. The "Catholic substance" of union with God needs the "Protestant principle" that only God is God; grace transforms, but conflict and sin remain. If one has already decided that the present order of creation is either unredeemably alien from God or only a neutral support for the important work of salvation, then Jesus must be seen as one who leaves untouched our worldly activities. For John Paul, Christ is healing a wounded creation while elevating it—giving a new and transcendent purpose to its on-going evolution. God who wondrously created has even more wondrously renewed; the creating God, redeeming God, and fulfilling God are one and the same. In such a graced, though yet to be fully redeemed world, each human being—the imago Dei, imago Christi, and temple of the Spirit—is able to cooperate with God in bringing about the kingdom of God.</page><page sequence="21">John Paul II and Cooperation with God 101 Notes A note concerning sources: Throughout this essay, I use the names Wojtyla and John Paul to refer respectively to the prepapal and papal writings. Many of his papal themes are evident in his prepapal Sources of Renewal (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1980). In addition I include these prepapal writings: Love and Responsibility (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1981); "Intentional Act and the Human Act," Analecta Husserliana, vol. S (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1976); "Participation or Alienation?" Analecta Husserliana, vol. 6 (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1977); "Subjectivity and the Irreducible in Man," Analecta Husserliana, vol. 7 (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1978); "The Person: Subject and Community," Review of Metaphysics 32/2 (December 1979); "The Personal Structure of Self-Determination," Tommaso d'Aquino net suo VII Centenario Congesso Internationale Roma-Napoli, np. (April 1974); The Acting Person (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1979); "The Transcendence of the Person in Action and Man's Self-Teleology," Analecta Husserliana, vol. 9 (Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1979); Sign of Contradiction (New York: Seabury, 1979); Toward a Philosophy of Praxis (New York: Crossroad, 1981). The range of papal writings is enormous. Included are: Christifideles laid; Dives in misericordia; Dominum et vivicantem; Familiaris consortio; Laborem exercens; Reconciliado et poenitentia; Redemptor hominis; Redemptoris mater; Salvifici doloris; Solicitado rei socialis; "Peace with God the Creator, Peace with All Creation," Origins 19/28 (December 14, 1989): 465; and selected speeches printed in Osservatore Romano, English ed., collected in The Social Teaching of John Paul II, ed. Pontifical Commission of Justice and Peace, vols. 4-8 (n.p.: Vatican City, 1982). (Citations will use only the first key word or words of the title. Since papal documents appear in a variety of editions, numbers in citations refer to section numbers. The unfortunate use of non-inclusive language in the official translations will be preserved.) I acknowledge the danger of a category mistake: the pope's speeches and writings are not theological tracts, but papal proclamations. Still there seems to be an underlying theology which this essay tries to illumine. 1. For a splendid account of recent difficulties in providing a theological foundation for Catholic ethics, see Vincent MacNamara, Faith and Ethics (Washington: Georgetown University Press, 1985). The question, however, is classic. 2. Popular and scholarly writing discusses this aspect of the pope's thought under the category of co-creation. See, for example, Michael Novak, Freedom with Justice (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1984), 149-64; Brien Hallett, "Pope John Paul II's Challenge to the American Bishops," America (May 4,1985): 371; John Houck and Oliver Williams, eds., Co-Creation and Capitalism: John Paul II's Laborem Exercens (Washington, D.C.: University Press of America, 1983). In fact, though Karol Wojtyla used the term "co creation" (Love, 54-56), I have not found it in papal texts. Still there is considerable continuity between the writings of Wojtyla and John Paul, and the term is not inapt. 3. In both his prepapal and papal works, the writing of John Paul is notoriously opaque. His thinking is more associative than rigorously logical; he connects disparate ideas with qualifiers such as "in a sense," without indicating what that sense is. His thought is more circular than linear; he mulls over a topic, going over an idea again and again. In critically evaluating his theological vision, to which I am sympathetic, I leave aside his specific judgments, e.g., on birth control or economic policy. I also do not consider whether his practical moral judgments follow from, contradict, or are unrelated to his</page><page sequence="22">102 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics theological vision. The relation between foundational themes and specific judgments of any author is notoriously complex and hard to demonstrate. 4. Dives, 1. 5. John Mahoney, S.J., The Making of Moral Theology: A Study of the Roman Catholic Tradition (Oxford: Garendon Press, 1987), 247. The choice of the word "instrument" is unfortunate. 6. Acting Person, 263-67,269-71, 279-83; "Participation," 70-71; "Person," 288-89, 294, 305-7; these earlier philosophical reflections are applied to the Church in Christifide les, 28. 7. "Participation," 69-72. With some considerable pathos, Wojtyla praises those who lived in concentration camps yet continued to view their captors as human persons. See also "Person," 306-7 and Salvifici, 7. Participation has a normative edge: do human structures and products create conditions for the development of participation or do they impede it? Put more positively, participation requires an attitude of solidarity. See "Participation," 73; Acting Person, 271-72,275; "Person," 301; Solicitudo, 40. For John Paul, "The growing need for participation" is one of the "distinctive features of present-day humanity" (Christifideles, 5). He denounces the "marginality to which some women are subjected simply because they are women," and true to his general emphasis, he argues, "it is women themselves who must recognize their responsibility as leading characters" (Christi fideles, 49). 8. Renewal, 61. 9. Dominum, 34, 52. 10. Dives, 4, 7 (emphasis added). In his long commentary on Vatican II, Cardinal Wojtyla concentrated on the doctrine of creation. He viewed redemption as a continuation of God's revelatoiy action begun in creation. Renewal, 45-47; Dominum, 12-14, 63. 11. Dominum, 58-59. 12. This lovely symbol is not very definite and therefore not very restrictive of possible interpretations. Theologians, if not also exegetes, make up or stipulate a meaning in accord with their system. What is essential is that the phrase indicates that there is a relation between God and human beings. There is not, pace Karl Barth, an "absolute unlikeness." See Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Gark, 1961), 3/3:104. 13. Labor em, 4. 14. The term "dominion," of course, has come under considerable criticism. In his recent writings, John Paul has become more attentive to the downside of the term, and he now insists on respect for creation: "Peace," 7, 15; Solicitudo, 29, 34; Christi fideles, 43. 15. Laborem, 4, 5; Familiaris, 11, 30; Dives, 10. Alongside these rather progressive statements which praise and demand the exercise of human creativity to transform creation, there are more traditional statements: before and after being made pope, John Paul developed an articulate and intelligent—if unconvincing—defense of the Gturch's position on birth control based on a traditional view of natural law. Thus, the laws of the natural order have their foundation in God (Love, 56-57), and justice demands that persons submit in obedience to this divine order of nature (Love, 222-27, 245-49). On the one hand, John Paul upholds our ability to make a "better humanity"; on the other, he holds that all this must take place within God's original ordering (Laborem, 4). 16.

"Participation," 62-64; "Person," 274-75. 22. "Self-Determination," 381; "Subjectivity," 110. For Wojtyla, the tradition did not sufficiently take into account the subjectivity of the agent. It concentrated on the conditions of freedom of the will without sufficiently noticing that in actions what persons chiefly do is to determine their very selves; see "Intentional Act," 269-70, 278; "Self Determination," 381-83; "Person," 277-80; Acting Person, 267-68; "Transcendence," 204-6.

In a nasty moment, Hauerwas defines work as what the rich do not have to do, and then he suggests that theologies of work are what some rich do with their leisure. Wages are good not as a means for distributing the common good, but only insofar as they direct us to "the important moral and social purposes ..., namely, ... to have and raise our children" (Ibid., 52). Hauerwas's position in the cited essay seems quite different from one he earlier held: "We are morally participants in God's very life.... Our participation in God's life is not a mystical absorption in which the self is lost, but rather a participation in the history he creates for and with us in the world."

They could not know that John Paul would address these issues a year later in Reconcil iatio. If we can make a broad generalization, we might see Laborem exercens as the high point of his optimistic papal views. And we could say that, along with the rest of the Western world, he has since been adding a more cautious and restrictive view which emphasizes human suffering and sin. A large part of his recent encyclical on the Holy Spirit is given to the Spirit's role in "convincing the world concerning sin." See Solicitado, 27. 75.

Through knowledge and love we become another, but that other does not lose its proper existence, nor do we lose our finitude and selfhood. Human beings overstep their limits when they fail to realize that they are what they are by participating in others and that they are not that in which they participate. They share in God's life and activity, but they are not God. Those who lack an adequate theory of participation will falsely judge that any attempt to share in God's life must be either a usurpation of God's prerogatives or the loss of self. Rather, in an adequate theory of participation, human beings remain what they are, finite, even as they share in the infinite. 83. Reconciliatio, 14; Christífideles, 4. 84.

Typical of Barth's dialectical theology, once he has insisted on this distinction, he then claims that God ignores the distinction and is concerned about what is properly human. For Barth, God "has bound Himself to man and the world in creating them. . . . [God] is engaged, not merely in His superiority over the creature, but also in His relationship to it. ... He is also his God, concerned in the innermost depths of His deity to meet his need" (Ibid., 3/4:480-81). This God "has become Brother of man in Jesus Christ," and thus this God "is not too superior to make use of man's active life in His service" (Ibid., 3/4:482). 88. Ibid., 3/3:45-52. These "occasionalist" objections of Barth represent only one phase of his dialectical thought. As will appear later, after denying human cooperation, he seems to assert it. Thus his term "co-respond" suggests not only a response to God's prior initiative but also cooperation or union with God. 89. Ibid., 3/4:482. 90. Ibid., 3/3:92-93: Having strongly denied that the creature has anything of its own, Barth—as is his wont—goes on to "make the dangerous assertion" that God cooperates with the creature, affirming its autonomous activity. Grace would also not be itself if it sup pressed the autonomous agent. God loves the creature and accepts solidarity with it.</page><page sequence="26">106 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics 91. Barth sums up: creatures "have no power to co-operate with God. It can only turn out that they do so in fact to the extent that God takes the initiative towards them, He Himself co-operating with them and giving them on their side the opportunity—beyond any capacity of their own—to co-operate with Him. By the grace of God the events of nature and history are authorized and qualified to co-operate with Him... . God Himself accompanies those events" (Ibid., 3/3:110). Still, "As man is summoned to this active participation, he will accept the strict and salutary distinction between God and man" (Ibid., 3/4:474, 482). As these quotes indicate, except for the way they underscore the difference between God and creatures, John Paul and Barth may agree. 92.

Still, there are ethical and religious problems with his view of human self-determination. For example, the "point" of an act of worship is the praise of God, not the development of self. Further, his understanding of self-determination as dominion obscures other forms of freedom such as Gelassenheit or "letting-be." 94. Dominum, 42. 95. His insufficiency in this regard, I think, leads John Paul to the old, but—after Karl Rahner—odd, claim that atheists are sinners. This confusion also appears in his mis understanding of the fundamental option. Reconciliatio, 14, 17. 96. I attempt to develop an existential theory of participation in my forthcoming Love of God, Love of Neighbor, Love of Self. 97.

Fuchs, "Gottesbild," 364-73, 378. 101. A distinction must be made between living the moral life and knowing the morally right thing to do. Perhaps because of his ecclesiastical role, John Paul speaks often about the difficulty of the former, less often of the latter. Still, in recent writing, he acknowledges some difficulties in knowing what is right. He notes that conscience is conditioned in history and that conscience must engage in a laborious effort, wrestling constantly to cling to the good. This conscience may even have so hardened itself as to lack any sense of God. See Dominum, 44-45, 47. 102. Ibid., 43. 103. Ibid., 43, 44. 104. Recently, however, John Paul wrote, "Even the application of very certain principles is not always easy, for the confrontation with opposite demands clouds our imperfect vision and therefore our perception of the absolute values which depend neither on our vision nor on our emotions." Origins 19/32 (January 11, 1990): 525. Still, the accent here is on our finitude, not on any real conflict or any creatively new solution. 105. Solicitado, 47. 106. Christifideles, 40. 107.
