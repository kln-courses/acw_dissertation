Problems As stated in the Foreword to Part I of this monograph this entire study of the incubation behaviour of the herring gull arose from the question which of the various physical features of the egg are effective, and to what extent, in stimulating incubation responses. More briefly one might call this the problem of egg-recognition. However, the use of such a term bor- rowed from everyday use in human behaviour easily introduces pre- judices in our thinking about the processes involved (see TINBERGEN, 1953, p. 156). We therefore prefer to use instead of'recognition' the term 'stimulus selection', defined as the phenomenon whereby the various physical stimuli activating the receptors of an animal are not quantitat- ively equivalent with regard to their controlling effect on a particular behaviour pattern and can consequently - with respect to that pattern -be ranked in order of effectiveness. The notion that only a selection of all physical properties of objects to which an animal responds may be active in triggering such behaviour, originated with von UEXKULL (1909) and his concepts of the animal's 'Umwelt' and 'Innenwelt'. In several cases it has since been found that the features particularly effective in releasing responses also tend to be features by which the stimulus constellation can be objectively characterized. It seems therefore likely that through this selective respon- siveness the chance of inadequate reactions to objects in the environment is lessened. LORENZ (1935) conceived of a sensory mechanism responsible for this selectivity which he termed 'angeborenes auslosendes Schema', a name later translated by TINBERGEN (1951) as 'innate releasing mechanism' (IRM). On the basis of results from a few cases studied it was taken for granted that this kind of selectivity was not due to ex- perience with the situation involved. In the early thirties this IRM-concept strongly stimulated experimen- tal ethological research. At the University of Leiden, Dr Nikolaas TINBERGEN undertook with several of his pupils the experimental analysis of stimulus situations releasing particular responses - inspired by the methods developed by von FRISCH to make animals answer questions. One of these studies concerned the 'releasing mechanism' of aggressive and sexual behaviour in sticklebacks, another the habitat orientation of digger wasps and a third egg-recognition in the herring gull. The latter</page><page sequence="8">VIII FOREWORD study was started in 1935; I had the privilege of taking part in it as a field assistant until 1937, when the work was continued by H. L. BooY, L. W. D. CAUDRI and A. QUISPEL (see TINBERGEN, 1953). There were several reasons for choosing 'egg-recognition' in birds as a subject for the analysis of a 'releasing mechanism'. Firstly, the stimuli used by the gulls are chiefly visual. Thus eggs can easily be exchanged for dummies the appearance of which can be varied at will. They can easily be presented to the birds in or near the nests under constant standard conditions, especially when the nests are open, relatively uncomplicated, structures. The latter is true for the herring gull, which breeds in great numbers in the Dutch dunes in colonies comprising several hundreds of territories (25-100 m2) each defended by a pair. Secondly, herring gulls are not too sensitive to the disturbance unavoidably caused, even by a careful experimenter. Because of the strong predation pressure these gulls exert on other birds the Dutch nature conservancy authorities, at the time of our study, tried to keep their numbers under control, mainly by killing the eggs through shaking (VAN DOBBEN, 1934). This treatment stopped the development of the eggs but not the gull's incubation behaviour. For the rest the gullery was kept undisturbed, to avoid that the gulls would spread over a much larger area. Consequently it was possible to work in these colonies without in- terference from visitors. The abundance of the herring gull makes it easy to select from the population a considerable number of suitable birds (relatively tame and not nesting in dense cover) to be tested. Finally, wild birds need not to be taken care of; they look after themselves! The results obtained by the Leiden-group have been summarized in TINBERGEN'S 'The Herring Gulls World' (1953). The data are suggestive of the presence in the gulls of an IRM for visually responding to an egg as an incubation object. The gulls settled on, and/or retrieved, a variety of substitute objects, provided these objects were three-dimensional, and were presented inside the nest-bowl or on or close to the nest-rim. When gulls were given a choice between their own typically coloured clutch and one with different appearance (more speckled or less, differing in background colour) the gulls were not, or at least not to a statistically significant extent, found to prefer their own type of eggs. From the data obtained with egg-dummies TINBERGEN concluded that genuine eggs were only slightly more stimulating than the best wooden imitations used, and that - although he obtained some indications that the natural egg colours were a little more effective - several other background col-</page><page sequence="9">FOREWORD IX ours were almost equally effective, except for red which definitely was the least stimulating one for incubation responses. The results of tests of the effectiveness of speckles on the eggs were inconsistent; at best they pointed to a minor role only of speckling in inducing incubation responses. Although a considerable number of responses was obtained to non-eggshaped dummies the natural egg-shape seemed to be preferred over the abnormal shapes, but abnormally shaped dummies with round- ed edges were more effective than blocks, cylinders or prisms with sharp ones. Finally it was established that undersized dummies were inferior to normally sized ones, while strong indications were obtained for an even higher effectiveness of oversized dummies. Such stimulus situations ex- ceeding the normal one in effectiveness were named 'supernormal'. However, the results of most of the experiments ( = series of tests in which the same combination of dummies was presented) were not free of am- biguity. This could mean that the releasing mechanism for incubation behaviour contains little information about the features of the eggs, but it might also reflect the insufficient sensitivity of the experimental techni- que applied for detecting the relative effectiveness of the various egg- characteristics. When in a series of choice tests in which two types of dummies were simultaneously presented no clear preference for one of these types was found the birds instead displayed a preference for one of the two sites on which the objects were placed. Thus, site preference could be expected as an alternative means for the gull to reach a decision in case the effectiveness of the two dummy types actually is equal. In con- trast, increase of sensitivity implied reduction of site preference. Differences in details of the behaviour of gulls towards real eggs with that in first confrontations with naturally coloured wooden dummies, as well as differences in details between the reactions to carefully and towards roughly imitated dummies, aroused in me suspicion about the sensitivity of the techniques so far used. As a consequence I also began to doubt the then generally accepted opinion that releasing mechanisms would only contain information on a relatively small, but strongly mark- ed, number of features characterizing the object, with a high effectiveness for triggering the corresponding response. Could it be that the ex- perimental methods used had not been sufficiently sensitive to detect in- fluences of less effective features? The analysis carried through by TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) on the releasing value of different features of the herring gull's head and bill for the food begging response of their chicks, had indeed revealed differences in sensitivity for different elements of the stimulus situation (see also V.1.). The red colour of the</page><page sequence="10">X FOREWORD patch on the bill, for instance, was found to be about 5 times as effective as the yellow bill colour or the white head of the bird. The large number of responses that could be obtained per test, as well as the large number of chicks tested, must favourably have influenced the sensitivity of the method used by these authors. Improvement of the methods for the analysis of releasing mechanisms seemed important. This held the more since LORENZ (1935), generalizing from the few studies made, drew the theoretically important conclusion that responsiveness to a small number of highly effective sign stimuli would be characteristic for innate releasing mechanisms, whereas by contrast mechanisms sensitive to a larger number of often less prominent features would have developed in the animal by way of conditioning. It became obvious that more thorough quantitative case studies of the way in which an individual animal responds to a particular stimulus situation in its natural environment were needed. This need was not only felt by European ethologists, but also by experimental psychologists, as expressed in the following quotation from LASHLEY (1938, p. 453): 'It is really imperative that we make a serious effort to define the adequate stimulus, not only in studies of instincts but equally in studies of reflexes and of learning. Psychological theories based upon the relations of stimulus and responses remain sheer nonsense so long as the stimulus is defined only as whatever the experimenter puts in front of the animal. We have gone far enough in this work to be sure that the animal rarely reacts to what the experimenter regards as the stimulus. In any complex situation the true basis of reaction can be discovered only by systematic variation of all the parts and properties of the supposed stimulus'. Hence, when the Leiden-group discontinued the herring gull studies after TINBERGEN had moved to Oxford in 1949, I decided to take up the egg-recognition issue again. With the help of several students from the University of Groningen, taking part in field courses in ethology, I tested in 1951 all techniques we could think of. Having decided on what seemed to be the most suitable and promising method I continued the study dur- ing 12 incubation seasons in the period 1951-1972. During that period some 20 students working for their master degrees joined me in testing the relative effectiveness of various characteristics of the herring gull's egg. We also investigated related problems, such as the way in which in- formation from different features is integrated by the reacting animal, the ontogeny of the selective sensitivity and its possible survival value in evolution.</page><page sequence="11">FOREWORD XI In the course of the years our views on the IRM-concept frequently underwent modification but, although we repeatedly passed through periods of extreme doubt on the scientific validity of this concept, we did not lose our belief in its heuristic value. Yet, in the final phase of this study we are less inclined to speak of 'the analysis of a releasing mechanism' and would rather call this study 'an investigation of informa- tion processing' in an animal. This second part of this monograph on the Herring Gull's Egg begins (Section I) with a description of the external morphology of the egg. It lays an emphasis on the variation of the visual features, the effectiveness of which is investigated in the chapters of Section II. These features have been grouped into four categories, each corresponding with a group of experiments carried out by another team of co-workers. These categories are: features of size and length-width proportion, other features of shape, colour and speckling. From the data presented in the four chapters on stimulus effectiveness general rules can easily be derived. Nevertheless consistent deviations from these rules do occur. In chapter 11.6. it will be shown how this phenomenon can be explained by the influence of dif- ferences in the internal motivation on the decision made by the bird. Chapter 11.7. deals with the way in which the information received on the various egg features present in the external situation, after evaluation, is combined into an afferent output controlling the type, intensity and direction of the response (heterogeneous summation, effect of supernor- mal stimuli). In Section III the question is asked in how far the selective effectiveness found with respect to the retrieval response equally applies for other responses (response specificity of the releasing mechanism). In a separate chapter of the General Discussion (V.1.) the evidence obtained in the herring gull is compared with relevant data for related species. Chapter IV.2. reports on some experiments aimed at investigating the possible origin (ontogeny) in the individual of the selective responsiveness towards features concerning the egg. Finally in Section V some theoretical issues concerning the releasing mechanism concept, such as its possible physiological background and its implications for evolution, are discussed. The main body of the experimental work was done in the period 1951-1960. Lack of time to work out the data, due to my administrative and educational duties, has seriously postponed the final publication of this study. On the other hand it has given us an opportunity to carry out additional series of experiments in later years. Moreover, during this</page><page sequence="12">XII FOREWORD prolonged incubation period our views on the data and the concepts have evolved and I hope improved. As always with work done by a large team the authorship of the dif- ferent chapters posed some problems. We have finally decided to men- tion as authors or co-authors only those advanced students who worked for at least two seasons on the same subject and concluded this work by an internal report. The other co-workers will be mentioned in the acknowledgements. Dr R. H. Drent, who was not only the author of the first half of Part I of this monograph but in addition assisted me in editing that entire issue, very kindly agreed to also act as co-editor for this Part II. His contribu- tion is certainly not restricted to the technical aspects of this monograph, I owe very much to his kind support during the time consuming phase of working through the data and writing up the results, to his critical but constructive attitude towards the interpretation of the data and his com- pensation of my shortcomings. Two of my co-workers, Miss G. J. BLOKZIJL and Dr J. P. KRUIJT, shared in the field work during all phases of the study. Without their en- thusiasm and strong support in scientific and logistic matters we would not have been able to carry out the extensive programme underlying this monograph. The basis of the present volume was laid down during my stay in the academic year 1964/1965 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, U.S.A. In spite of this I would not have managed to finish the work if not the Netherlands Ministry of Education and Sciences had made it possible for me to devote from 1974 on the greater amount of my time to research. Thanks to a grant of the Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Pure Research, Dr DRENT could stay in Groningen during part of the academic year 1971/1972 to join me in the planning of this volume.

BAERENDS and A. J. HOGAN-WARBURG 1. Introduction It stands to reason that a study of the sensitivity of a bird to various features of its eggs should be preceded by a description of these eggs. Such a description should cover the variation in features among in- dividual eggs within the bird population studied: it should therefore be quantitatively substantiated. A quantitative description enables us to define the external appearance of the 'average herring gull egg' in the population. This is important in connection with the design of egg models used as retrieval objects for the gulls. A quantitative description of the eggs is also important in connection with the evolutionary question as to how this variation among the herring gulls' eggs has come about, and is being maintained. Phenotypic varia- tion must have a basis in genotypic variation, if natural selection is to operate. This is the reason, why we want to investigate whether the phenotypic variation among the herring gulls' eggs is related to genotypic variation, and if so, what selection pressures have been operating. In the context of this study on egg retrieval, the question arises whether characteristics of the responsiveness of the gulls to their eggs might have provided selection pressures that have contributed to the evolution of the egg's morphology. There are two sources of phenotypic variation: genetic and environmental factors. In a field study of this nature, there are two methods by which one can acquire information about the genotypic variation as a possible source of phenotypic variation among the herring gulls' eggs. In method 1, one compares the variation of eggs within and among females. That is to say: one compares the variation of eggs from suc- cessive clutches of the same individually-marked females with the varia- tion of eggs from clutches of different, individual females. Method 1 has not been applied. Thus this type of information is not available. In method 2, one compares the variation among the eggs within</page><page sequence="15">2 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG clutches with the variation among the eggs in the entire sample. That is to say: one compares the variation of eggs within clutches with the variation of eggs between clutches. In the case, that variation within clutches is smaller than this variation between clutches, one can conclude that eggs within a clutch have features that are characteristic of the female. Theoretically the possibility cannot be excluded yet, that genotypic varia- tion is absent as far as appearance of the egg is concerned and that the phenotypic variation is exclusively caused by variation in the en- vironmental factors. However, environmental factors solely responsible for the occurrence of female characteristic egg features are difficult to conjecture, although a dietary effect of feeding specialisations among females should be considered with an open mind. Therefore, the far more likely interpretation of female characteristic egg features is that genotypic variation contributes to the phenotypic variation among the herring gulls' eggs. In the case it was also shown that variation withinfemales was smaller than variation amongfemales, the hypothesis on dietary differences among individual females would have to be disregarded, because random dif- ferences in feeding are unlikely to repeat themselves, especially if clutches from successive seasons are being compared among each other. Conclusive evidence that phenotypic variation has a basis in genotypic variation can be established only experimentally by selective breeding. Artificial selection, for instance, would allow us to separate large egg and small egg strains. However, since the herring gull is not a very suitable animal for breeding in captivity over several generations, this experimen- tal approach is not available. Comparative studies of selective breeding in other species of birds are only remotely useful, because selective pressures for various egg features differ undoubtedly from species to species (DALY &amp; WILSON, 1978). Beside this interest for the causes underlying differences in the appearances of eggs, if eggs prove to have features typical for the individual female or for the clutch, the possibility that the parents would recognize their own eggs should be considered. 2. Material and methods In 1955 in a restricted, until then undisturbed, area of the breeding colony on Terschel- ling, 100 full clutches - i.e. with 3 eggs each - were randomly sampled and brought to the field laboratory. Measurements or assessments were made in weight, size, shape, speckling, and colour of speckles and background. The person evaluating the eggs took them at random from the sample and had no knowledge of how the code by which each egg was marked referred to the clutch and to the part of the gullery from which it came. For each clutch the order in which the eggs had been laid (A - B - C, see Part I, p. 5) was</page><page sequence="16">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 3 (1 13 D -- Wi - Fig. 1. The measurements made on the eggs and the projection of the areas in which the spots were measured and counted. deduced from comparing their degrees of embryonic development. Photographs were made of each clutch in a standardized manner (Plate I, II). Wherever a quantitative description of a character was possible the grand average for the entire population (M) and its standard deviation (a) were calculated with the following formulae: M (x x a) and =V/ E(x-x) in which x stands for the values measured for a particular item, a for the number of eggs in which that value was found and N for the total number of eggs involved. Next the variance of the item for the entire population was statistically compared with that within clutches. For this purpose the 'quick method' described by MORONEY (1963, p. 376ff) was followed. In this method a 'Correction Factor' (C) is computed with the formula C = , in which T is the grand total of all values of x. Then: total sum of squares = grand total of squares of all values minus correction factor, or E (x2) - C (I) among sample sum of squares = 1/3 x sum of squares of sum of values per clutch minus cor- rection factor, or 1 = E (Ex)2 - C (II) within clutches sum of squares = I-II (III) The degrees of freedom are for (I): number of eggs (N) - 1 (a), for (II): number of clutches - 1 (b), and for (III): a-b (c). Consequently: the variance among sample is: I = V1, and its standard deviation a = Vvl; the variance within clutches: II= V2, and its standard deviation a2 = /v2. The difference between these two variances is in our case (a = 299, b= 99, c = 200) significant at the 1% level when F= v1 exceeds 1.5 (MORONEY, 1963).

Results A. Comparison of variance within and between clutches. a. Weight and volume. The results of the weighings are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The ratio (F) of the variances among all eggs sampled and within clutches is highly significant. In 46 of the 96 clutches available the differences between the three eggs were less than 6 g, in 33 clutches they were between 6 and 10 g and in 16 clutches over 10 g. It is interesting that in 13 of the latter clutches only one egg differed more than 6 g from the two others. In 7 of these clutches the C-egg was deviant, in 3 clutches the A-egg, and in none the B-egg; in 3 of these clutches the relative age could not be determined since one of the eggs was addled. A comparison of the relative weight of the three eggs in all clutches is given in Table 2. The C-egg tended to be the smallest of the clutch, the B-egg the largest. The use of weight as a measure for comparing the size variance of eggs within and among clutches is open to criticism since the weight of an egg is influenced by the time it has been incubated. The weight loss through evaporation of an incubated egg is 0.5-0.6 g per day (BARTH, 1953; DRENT, 1970). In our case the clutches were all collected about 20 days after the peak of laying, which fell within 8 days. The maximum weight difference between eggs of different clutches to be expected from dif- ferences in laying dates within this peak is 5 g. As this is far below the variance found between eggs of different clutches (13 g) we are of opinion that this inter-clutch variance cannot be attributed to age differences between the clutches. In addition, weight differences of more than 1.5 g between eggs of the same clutch cannot be due to differences in the time they were incubated. However, for comparison of overall size we have also applied a volumetric measure: since the egg may be considered as a surface of revolution of its median section (PRESTON, 1974) we determined the sur- face of the maximum projection of each egg by means of a planimeter in the standardized photographs of each clutch. The data and the variances calculated from them are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Again the variance among clutches far exceeds that within. b. Linear dimensions. Length and width of each egg were measured as indicated in Fig. 1 by means of calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. The results are given in Table 1</page><page sequence="19">TABLE 1.

For both measures the variances within clutches and among clutches differ significantly. The variances for width, however, were much smaller than those for length. With regard to length in 49 out of 96 clutches the differences among the eggs were less than 4 mm, in 39 clutches they varied between 4 and 6 mm and in 8 they exceeded 6 mm. In 7 of the latter clutches, however, only one egg was different to that extent, the other two differing less than 4 mm. Width differed between 0 and 1 mm in 46 out of 96 clutches, in 32 clutches the maximum difference between eggs was 2 mm and in 19 clut- ches 3 mm or more. In 6 of the latter this relative large difference was due to one egg, the other two differing 2 mm or less. A comparison of the linear dimensions of the three eggs of the same clutch showed that the length of the C-egg was in 56 clutches smaller than that of the B-egg and in 59 clutches smaller than the A-egg; both dif- ferences may be considered significant (sign test, p &lt;0.05). The width of the C-egg was in 44 clutches smaller than that of the B-egg (p = 0.05) and</page><page sequence="21">8 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG in 41 clutches smaller than that of egg A (n.s.). Thus, although both length and width may account for the smaller volume of the C-egg, length seems chiefly involved. c. Shape. Nearly all herring gull eggs we have seen had the typical egg-shape with a blunt and a pointed pole. The only exception were extremely undersized eggs, less than 4.5 cm long and 3.5 cm wide (Plate III). However, some eggs have a more rounded appearance, others a more elongated shape. PRESTON (1953, 1968, 1969) has developed an elaborate mathematical method for describing the shape of an egg using length, width and the radii of both poles to specify three shape parameters, viz. elongation, asymmetry and bicone. Lack of a suitable spherometer made it impossi- ble for us to follow his method with respect to the latter two parameters. COULSON (1963) and GOODMAN &amp; SHEALEY (1977) have used 100 x width/length as a shape index. We have tried to quantify the dif- ferences in shape in the following four ways, viz. by means of the: (1) length/width ratio (comparable with PRESTON'S 'elongation' and COULSON'S 'shape index'); (2) the distance D between the blunt end and the cross section of largest width of the egg; (3) the ratio between length and D; (4) the ratio between width and D. The distance D gives some expression of the degree to which an egg is rounded or pointed. Table 1 shows that indeed D tends to differ less be- tween the eggs of the same clutch than between eggs of different clutches. Ratios, such as L/Wi, L/D and Wi/D are more suitable for expressing differences in shape, provided at least that L, Wi and D are sufficiently independent, i.e. do not correlate, or when correlating have a relation which can be expressed by a regression equation y = mx + c in which c does not equal 0. In Table 3 the product moment correlation coefficients and the regression equations are given. Since c deviates considerably from 0 it is permissable to use the ratios L/Wi, L/D and Wi/D as indices for shape. The total variance of these ratios is given in Fig. 2 and in Table 1. This table also makes a comparison of the variances of the ratios among and within clutches possible. As the F-values for the three ratios are all&gt; 1.5, the 1% level of confidence, we may conclude that - at least according to these measures used - an egg tends to be more similar in shape to other eggs of the same clutch than to eggs randomly taken from other clutches.</page><page sequence="22">TABLE 3.

X2 over all cells = 198.5. Differences in shapes of the poles are more conspicuous at the pointed than at the rounded poles. Therefore, with regard to pole shape we have only compared individual eggs with regard to the shape of the pointed ends. We have distinguished - on the basis of visual assessment - among three categories: pointed, normal and rounded. The distribution of these three categories within clutches is shown in Table 4. Clearly the same type of pole occurs significantly more often in all three eggs of a clutch than could be expected in case of random distribution. Conse- quently, the shape of the pointed end of the egg is a characteristic of the clutch. No indications were found of a tendency of either the A-, the B-, or the C-egg to show more often than the'others one of the three types of poles. Thus, when two eggs of a clutch had the same type of pole while the third one was different, the probability for A-, B-, or C-egg to be the aberrant one was equal. However, when the shape index L/Wi was compared for the three eggs of a clutch, the means found were 1.45 for the A-egg, 1.44 for the B-egg and 1.43 for the C-egg. These differences cannot be considered signifi- cant, but the trend they seem to show also appears from the fact that the index was in 61% of the clutches lower for C- than for B-eggs (sign test, p&lt;0.10). Thus we tentatively conclude that in our herring gull sample the C-egg tended to be the least slender one of the clutch. d. Speckling. The spots on the herring gull egg may differ in colour, sharpness of their contours, size and shape. (Plates I, II, III, VIII) Generally one can distinguish clear, mostly dark, brown spots with sharp contours and faint greyish spots fading out in the ground colour. The former are called by</page><page sequence="24">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 11 oologists 'primary spots', the latter 'secondary spots'. The difference in colour and sharpness results from the deposition of pigment in layers. If a primary spot partly coincides with a secondary one, the former is always on top of the latter. When an area of the shell bearing a secondary spot is treated with sandpaper a sharp edged brown spot gradually emerges from the ground colour. In this way we could establish the presence of at least three layers of groundcolour on top of each other and covering the un- coloured chalk of the shell. The differential blending of spots resulting from this structure provides the egg with a camouflage pattern, sug- gesting differences in depth and thus visually disrupting the smooth sur- face of the egg shell (differential blending, COTT, 1940). In comparing the speckling patterns of eggs within and among clutches we have separately measured and counted the two kinds of spots, and as we often had the impression that the distribution of numbers and sizes of spots might not be even and/or similar on the pointed and the rounded pole of an egg, we took separate samples from both areas. This was done in the following way. A piece of paper, shaped as shown in Fig. 1 was placed on the egg in such a position that the baseline joining the two trapezia was laid around the widest cross section of the egg. The gauge was than pressed against the egg surface, its corners were marked on the shell and the trapezia were completed. The area sampled this way amounted to about 1/3 of the total surface of the egg. We decided on size and shape of these sample areas after comparison of five alternative possibilities of different size and/or shape with counts of the speckles on the entire egg surface. As a consequence of the use of the standard gauge the percentage of the surface area sampled on a small egg was slightly larger than on a big one. However, as no correlation was found to exist between the size of the egg and the number of speckles counted, this small error may be neglected. Fig. 2 and Table 1 summarize the results of the measurements of the number of spots per egg and of their size distribution. In these counts all visible speckles within the sample areas a and 0 together were incor- porated. For number and for size the variance between clutches exceeds the variance within them. This means that these features of the speckling patterns characterize individual clutches. To compare the speckling patterns in successive layers we have com- puted the correlation of the numbers of primary and secondary spots in our material. The results are given in Table 3. The mean number of primary spots was 106.1, that of the secondary spots 40.2. It is not possi- ble to infer whether this difference exists because in the earlier layer(s)</page><page sequence="25">BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG TABLE 5.

To assess to what extent consistent differences exist between the speckling patterns of the blunt and the pointed half of the egg we have compared the frequency distributions of the average density and of the average size of spots between the areas a and fi for the sample of 300 eggs available. Because of the high correlation between the distribution of primary and secondary spots on both halves we have refrained from in- corporating the secondary spots in this comparison. Table 3 shows that spot density as well as spot size are highly correlated between both halves of the egg. However, the mean density and the mean size are both lower in the a-area than in the ,f-area (density: a = 5.44 ±2.03 spots/cm2, 3= 8.43 + 3.09 spots/cm2; t= 14.0, p&lt;0.001; size: a = 144.7 + 35.4 mm, f = 162.5 + 37.2 mm, t = 4.4, p&lt; 0.001). Spots of different sizes occur on both halves of the egg. As Table 3 shows, the frequency distributions of different size classes in the a- and f-areas are highly positively correlated. The last line of Table 3 reveals that the number of spots in an egg and the average size of these spots tend to be negatively correlated, suggesting that in general eggs do not so much differ in the amount of brown pig- ment but rather in the distribution of this pigment among the speckles. Between the three eggs of a clutch almost no difference was found in the average size of the spots (Tables 2 and 5). However, as shown in Table 2, the number of spots was more often the largest in A-eggs. Cor- respondingly, Table 5 shows a higher average number of spots in A-eggs, whereas in B-eggs this number is relatively low. Sometimes an appreciable amount of the speckling on an egg has the form of scribbles or smears instead of roughly rounded spots (Plate IV). This cannot be attributed to ideosyncrasies of certain females since scrib- bles were never present in more than one egg of a clutch. In 98 of the clutches investigated the order in which the eggs had been laid could be deduced from the size of the embryos (in 2 clutches this was impossible 12</page><page sequence="26">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 13 because of an addled egg). Of the 65 eggs found with a scribble pattern 57 were the last laid eggs (C-eggs) of the clutch. Only 4 times a B-egg and also 4 times an A-egg was found to have a considerable amount of scrib- bles. e. Colour. The colour of the background and of the primary spots of each egg were determined through comparison in daylight of the freshly collected egg with an Ostwald colour scale (OSTWALD, 1939).

Each tone is characterized by a col- our number varying from 1 to 24, followed by a first letter (a, c, e, g, i, 1, n, p) indicating the amount of black, mixed with the pure colour in a stepwise increasing order, and a second letter (p, n, 1, i, g. e, c, a) in- dicating similarly the amount of white. According to the nomenclature proposed by RIDGWAY (1912) a colour darkened by admixture of black should be called a 'shade' and the latter one weakened through mixture with white a 'tint'. The colour numbers present in our measurements of background and spots were 23 and 24 (leafgreen) and 1 to 6 (yellow and orange). The principle is explained in Fig. 3.</page><page sequence="27">14 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG When two observers independently determined the colours of background and speckles of an egg they disagreed in 30% of the cases, but only rarely were their judgements farther apart than the next grade in the scale. One grade should therefore be taken as the expected error of measurement. Of the 672 tones available on the scale, 21 were scored as the best match for the groundcolour of eggs and 27 for the colour of first order speckles.

Three colour tones, 2ge (greenish grey), 2ni (olive) and 3ni (brownish olive) occurred considerably more often as groundcolour than the others. For each of them it has been computed in how many of 100 clutches this colour could be expected on none, one, two or three eggs, provided that Fig. 4 would represent a fair sample of the distribu- tion of the various colour tones in the population and that a tone would not be characteristic for a particular female. In Table 6:a these expected values are compared with those found. By means of the chi-square-test it was checked whether the colour occurred more frequently in none or in three eggs of a clutch, and at the same time less frequently in one or two eggs, than according to expectation. The difference turned out to be significant for 2ge, but not for 2ni and 3ni.</page><page sequence="28">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 15 TABLE 6.

Moreover, in 34 of these 60 clutches the 'aberrant' egg did not differ more than one tone from the two others, a difference thus within the error limit of the measurements.

We think that from these data the conclusion is justified that the three eggs of a clutch tend to have the same or a very similar groundcolour. Spot colour. As shown in Fig. 4, the dark brown to dark greenish brown tones 6pn, 5pl, 4ni and 31i occurred far more often than the other 23 tones scored.

Again in this table these figures are compared with the real data. The differences are all highly significant.</page><page sequence="30">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 17 In view of the fact that on the same egg sometimes more than one spot colour was scored we were not able to apply the second calculation used above (the matching egg method) for groundcolour. Colour differences among the three eggs of a clutch. Table 2 shows that the A-egg tended to be more often the darkest and the C-egg more often the brightest egg in the clutch. However, this result is not statistically reliable. It also appears when comparing the numbers of A-, B-, and C-eggs in the range of tones from 23ge to 2ig (lighter to darker greenish grey) with those in the range from 21g to 4pl (olive brown) (Table 7). The former range comprises brighter and at the same time more greenish tones, the latter darker, more brownish ones (see Fig. 4). We may con- clude that the brightest egg of a clutch is most likely to be the C-egg. This egg also tends to be more greenish or bluish; it looks paler, suggesting that less pigment has been deposited on it. Sometimes the palest egg shows up very clearly in the clutch (Plates II &amp; IX). Of 25 clutches (not belonging to the 100 clutches examined above) with one conspicuously pale egg this egg proved to be a C-egg 24 times; once it was a B-egg. Pale eggs also tend to have fewer spots; moreover some conspicuously large spots are often present on such eggs (Plates II, IV). This raises the question whether in general an inverse correlation exists between the number of speckles and their average size. We have tested this in our sample of 100 clutches and, as shown in the last line of Table 3, such a correlation in fact existed in this material. We found eggs with very few or without spots always to be light blue (6 of the 24 eggs mentioned above). Very rarely we came across an entire clutch of three cyanotic eggs without any speckles (Plate III). It is clear from these observations that poverty in amount or in the distribution of pigment (concentration in large spots) leads in combination to a reduction of the number of spots and to a blue ground colour. If this phenomenon occurs it is very likely to happen in the last-laid egg. B. Groundcolour of the eggs and character of the nest area. The type of vegetation throughout the gullery was not homogeneous. Roughly one could distinguish between relatively low areas with a dense vegetation of green grasses and herbs, dunes with dispersed marram (Am- mophila arenaria) tufts, and in between areas more or less densely covered with sea buckthorn (Hippophai rhamnoides) and creeping willow bushes (Salix repens). While collecting eggs in these different areas we obtained the impression that eggs with a greenish groundcolour tended to be more</page><page sequence="31">18 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG common in the grass areas, whereas brown eggs seemed to occur more frequently among the bushes and on the dunes. Of the 100 clutches dealt with so far it was known from what type of vegetation they originated. In this sample a correspondence between egg colour and type of vegetation was certainly not obvious but also not evidently absent. We therefore decided to determine the colour of about 150 more clutches. In the entire material of 785 eggs only 3 colour shades occurred fre- quently enough to make comparison possible; these were 2ni, 2ge and 21g. The frequency distributions for each of these shades and for the other shades taken together (rest) are given for the 3 vegetation types in Table 8. The figures found have been compared with the figures expected in case of random distribution by means of the formula X2 = Y (frequency found - frequency expected)2 frequency expected X2 was found to be 14.76; p = 0.05, DF = 6 (2-tailed). This means that the 3 colour shades are not randomly distributed. The greenest of the three shades, 21g, had most frequently been collected from the grass areas and was least common among the bushes. Here the brownest shade, 2ni, reached the highest percentage. Shade 2ge which to the human eye lies in between the two others was equally common in bushes and marrum, but occurred less frequently in the grass area. This result seems to confirm the impression we obtained while walking through the gullery; we feel, however, that this evidence is still weak. A much larger sample, permitting a more penetrating statistical treatment than carried out here, would be necessary for definitely accepting or re- jecting the hypothesis. In case the hypothesis would be correct one can think of different ex- planations for this phenomenon. On the one hand the possibility is im- aginable that the gull would be able to adjust the groundcolour of the egg to the dominant hue of the surroundings of the nest, perhaps by increas- ing the number of pigment layers when the environment is darker (see p. 26ff). If, on the other hand, the colouration would not be adjustable but characteristic of the individual female, one should consider the possibility of polymorphism within the gullery with respect to habitat preference in combination with the groundcolour of the eggs, as well as the possibility that individual gulls have experienced in earlier reproductive seasons which sites allow them to breed with success. The period in which the egg colour might be especially important for protection agains predators is the laying phase. During that phase the nest is not continuously guarded</page><page sequence="32">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 19 by the gulls; often it has not yet developed into an elaborate structure of dead yellow-brownish material and its immediate surroundings are not yet trampled by the birds (Plate XVI). Later on in the season when the nest-structure itself is much more conspicuous one can hardly imagine that slight differences in the ground colour of the egg make any difference with respect to anti-predator protection. 4. Discussion The data given above have shown that size, shape, colouration and speckling pattern vary less among eggs of the same than of different clutches. Thus, within a clutch, the eggs may show features that are characteristic of the female. This makes it likely that eggs from different clutches of the same female, in the same as well as in different years, will also show the female's typical characteristics. If an individual female would indeed tend to produce the same, individually specific, egg-type during her entire life, the question still remains open whether differences in egg-type among females are related to genetic differences. As we did not carry out measurements on more than one clutch of the same female we can only approach the answer to these problems in in- direct ways. First we shall consider what possibilities exist in the pro- cesses of egg formation that might allow for an 'individual touch' in the appearance of the egg. Second we shall look at the literature on various bird species for comparable data on constancy of appearance in eggs of individual females and, especially in domesticated species where selective breeding experiments have been carried out, on the constancy of various egg features in individuals of the same breed. a. The formation of the egg. Most of our knowledge about the proceedings involved in the formation of the various features of the egg at the time when it is laid, stems from research on domestic fowl (CONRAD &amp; SCOTT, 1938). However, the pic- ture emerging from this work seems sufficiently supported by more fragmentary evidence from other species to assume that it is likely to hold for the herring gull too. The following is a short survey, mainly directed at those processes which seem relevant to our considerations, viz. pro- cesses determining shape, size and colouration of the egg. In the avian oviduct five main parts are usually distinguished: the in- fundibulum (consisting of funnel and tuba), the magnum, the isthmus, the uterus and the vagina (which enters into the cloaca) (Fig. 5a). At the</page><page sequence="33">20 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG ovrium infundibulum magnumK a Fig. 5a.

The ovum is caught by the funnel and passes through the infundibulum where the material basic to the formation of the chalazae is secreted (RICHARDSON, 1935). This material forms mucin fibres which are wrapped around the yolk while the slowly rotating ovum is travelling further down through the successive parts of the oviduct (CONRAD &amp; PHILLIPS, 1938). The ovum reaches the magnum about half an hour after ovulation and takes three hours to pass it (the times men- tioned here have been taken from the work on domestic fowl by WARREN &amp; SCOTT, 1935a, b). In the magnum the egg white is added through secre- tion of albumen and glycogen in this region of the oviduct. By removing post-mortem developing ova from different parts of the oviduct it has been established that a distinction between a pointed and a blunt end (if existing in the species concerned) is already present when the ovum has reached the lower third part of the magnum (CURTIS, 1914; CONRAD &amp; SCOTT, 1938). From then on until one or two hours before laying, the pointed pole of the developing egg remains in a caudad position. As BRADFIELD (1951) maintains, this observation definitely refutes the theory of D'ARCY THOMPSON (1943), and others before him, that the pointed end would be the trailing one and that the conical shape would result from peristaltic propulsive forces in the oviduct - which were only presumed but never actually observed. BRADFIELD himself believes that the conical end of the egg is formed in the isthmus (where the fowl egg stays one hour). He points to the facts that the ovum fits closely in this relatively narrow part, of which in particular the caudal region is distinct- ly contractile, and that in the isthmus the fibrous keratin shell mem- branes are formed around the egg white. However, as this author does not refer to the papers arguing for the magnum as the first region where the egg shape is determined and as his supposition is not based on the radiographic data which form the basis of his study, one should probably attribute to the isthmus not more than a consolidating influence on egg shape. Experimental evidence of some influence of the isthmus on shape also follows from experiments by ASMUNDSON &amp; JERVIS (1933) in which part of the isthmus was resected. After passing the isthmus the ovum enters the uterus, or shell gland, where it stays for some twenty hours. Here the volume of the developing egg is almost doubled through osmotic infiltration of fluid through the shell membranes. This fluid is a salt solution, with little or no protein (SCOTT, HUGHES &amp; WARREN, 1937) and is secreted by the uterus wall. This process takes about seven hours; its end coincides with a con-</page><page sequence="35">BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG siderable speeding up of the deposition of the calcareous shell (BRAD- FIELD, 1951). This shell formation continues at a constant high rate until it levels off a few hours before oviposition. Different authors (e.g. NATHUSIUS, 1893; GIERSBERG, 1921, 1922, 1923; RICHARDSON, 1935; STEWART, 1935) have contributed to the description of the complicated process by which two different shell layers, the innermost mamillar layer and the outer spongy layer, are produced. The calcium deposited in these layers is thought to be secreted by cells of the uterine wall (SIMKISS, 1961). According to BRADFIELD (1951) the uptake of fluid by the egg white ceases fairly abruptly at about the time when the rate of shell deposition begins to rise sharply. At that time, therefore, the size of the egg is determined. The uterus is connected with the vagina not through its caudal but through its lateral wall. Thus, caudally the uterus forms a blind pocket and in it the pointed end of the egg is resting, caudally oriented. WICKMANN (1896) seems to have been first in reporting that shortly before oviposition the egg may turn 180° and then leave the bird with the blunt end first (Fig. 5b). BRADFIELD (1951) followed the egg-laying proce- dure with X-ray photography in a Rhode Island Red x Black Leghorn breed of hens. He observed a 180° rotation in the horizontal plane around the short axis. During this movement and while the hen is rising, the egg sinks to a more ventral position and becomes free of the pubic bones which would otherwise prevent it from being turned that way. BRADFIELD tends to the opinion that rotation, and consequently emergence of the egg with the blunt end first, always takes place when the hen is undisturbed and free to rise shortly before laying. However, most authors who have watched the egg-laying act, believe that both orientations may occur under normal conditions (OLSEN &amp; BYERLY, 1932; MOTOHASHI, 1935). In the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonica) laying of the egg with the pointed pole first is shown in filmshots and photographs taken by A. VAN MUNSTER and J. VEEN (HAANSTRA, 1973). OTTOW (1955), who reports cases of rotation in the black-headed gull, explains the variation in occur- rence of this phenomenon on the basis of variation in the pattern of con- traction of the musculature of the uterus shortly before egg-laying. It has been suggested that it depends on the choice of this pattern and the way the orifice in the uterine wall leading to the vagina is situated, whether the position of the pointed pole in the blind diverticulum of the uterus may facilitate or impede rotation (TAMMES, 1928; BRADFIELD, 1951; OTTOW, 1955). The prevailing idea, originating with WICKMANN (1896), that in the act of laying the uterus is prolapsed through the vagina after 22</page><page sequence="36">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 23 which the egg would be expelled through eversion instead of peristalsis is refuted by SYKES (1958). This author observed in anaesthetized laparotomized hens eggs passing into the vagina by muscle activity of the uterus. He found that pituitrin, which activated the musculature of the uterus but not that of the vagina, promoted the laying performance. OTTOW (1955) also rejected the theory that the uterus would prolapse, but on arguments derived from the comparative physiology of birth in general. The pigmentation of the eggs takes place in the uterus. Pigment is ab- sent on the ovum when it enters the uterus and is present when the egg is laid. The facts that for a long time several attempts to detect pigment in glands of the uterine wall had failed and that the egg-pigments can be considered as derivates from hemoglobin - they were identified as por- phyrins and bile-pigments (billiverdin) - have led to the hypothesis that the pigments would be transported towards the shell gland after having been produced elsewhere. It has been suggested that pigments might reach the uterus via the intestine-cloaca-vagina route, but this has never been substantiated. WICKMANN (1893) and TASCHENBERG (1894) postulated that blood derived from the ovulated follicle would be the source of the pigment, but without supporting their ideas with substantial evidence. KUTTER (1878) and GIERSBERG (1921, 1922, 1923), on the contrary, found hyperaemia in the magnum wall at the time of laying. The latter author in particular made it likely that around blood vessels lymphocytes collect hemoglobin from disintegrated erythrocytes and transform it into pigment, while car- rying it to the oviduct lumen. Here the pigment would precipitate as floc- cules which become suspended in the fluid secreted by the oviduct and descend with it towards the uterus. GIERSBERG was of the opinion that the fluid in which the pigment was suspended, after flowing around the egg from the blunt pole towards the pointed one, would denaturate and precipitate on the shell. The resulting layer, in which the pigment becomes embedded, he identified as the cuticle of the egg. The distribu- tion of the speckles on the shell - more numerous and somewhat larger on the blunt end, which was situated where the isthmus enters the uterus, and more dispersed and smaller at the opposite pole - could be explain- ed this way. Besides the flow of pigment from the magnum wall a second source of pigment has to be taken into account. After TURCHINI (1924) had reported that porphyrin granulae were secreted by cells in the uterus wall, simultaneously with calcium for the egg shell, FURREG (1931) found</page><page sequence="37">24 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG a red fluorescence in ultraviolet light, characteristic for this pigment, ex- clusively in the uterine part of the oviduct and also on pigmented shells. This makes it likely that the ground colour of eggs is derived from the uterus epithelium (TAMMES, 1964). As WARREN &amp; CONRAD (1942) did not find differences in the amount of pigment carried by uterine fluid of hens producing white versus hens producing brown eggs, they believe that the pigment of the groundcolour is directly secreted onto the eggs by the cells of the uterine epithelium. This pigment is being deposited when shell for- mation is still taking place. However, 50-75% is added in the last five hours before oviposition, which means that in the final quarter of the period during which the egg stays in the uterus pigmentation is ac- celerated. The same authors found that on turkey eggs speckles began to appear only 4-5 hours before oviposition. VERWEY (1924) and TAMMES (1928) have pointed to the possibility that in case of coincidence of pigmentation with the process of rotation and descendance of the egg in the uterus just before laying, abnormal arrangements of speckling, e.g. in spirals or a concentration of spots on the pointed instead of the blunted pole, might be produced. The groundcolour is supposed to be primarily caused by diffusely distributed billiverdin (oocyan) secreted by the uterine glands. It is bluish but can be mixed with porphyrins to form greenish, brownish and darker colours. TAMMES (1964) maintains that with billiverdin blue and the red to yellow variations of porphyrin the three primary colours have been realized through which all colour manifestations can be produced, such as in a three colour print. Some pigment may occur within the calcified eggshell (SCHMIDT, 1963), but we are interested only in the pigment applied on the surface of the eggshell, because it is the latter pigment that determines the external appearance of the egg through colour and patterning. The material covering the outside of the eggshell is usually called the cuticle. Its com- position is definitely different from that of the shell, but it varies con- siderably between species (SIMKISS, 1961). It does not contain cells and, according to SCHMIDT (1958), as it cannot be considered as a differentia- tion produced on the free surface of an epithelium, the name 'cuticle' would actually be incorrect. FURREG (1931) was of opinion that the cuticle is produced by the epithelium of the uterine wall but his evidence applies only to the red-fluorescing porphyrin, which he obviously identified with the cuticula without taking the other components into account. However, SIMONS (1971) deduced from microscopic studies that indeed the 'true cuticle' is secreted in the shell gland. The opinion of GIERSBERG (1921,</page><page sequence="38">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 25 1922) that the fluid carrying the pigment from the oviduct into the uterus would, after precipitation on the eggshell, contribute to the 'cuticle' also seems attractive to us. Provided that after the formation of the eggshell transport of material from the isthmus into the uterus is still possible, both opinions need not be incompatible. OTTOW (1955) who studied several species of birds, including gulls, collected data on the pigmenta- tion of eggs prematurely taken from the uterus at different stages of development of the eggshell. The data show that in an early stage the shell has an even light bluish or greenish colour whereas only later, beginning from the rounded pole, speckles appear and the colour becomes darker. SCHMIDT (1963) reported about personal communica- tions from OTTOW, stating that during the formation of the eggshell a sphincter closes the passage from isthmus to uterus. For this reason OTTOW is apparently of the opinion that GIERSBERG'S hypothesis cannot be correct. In contrast, it seems to us that this sphincter could be func- tional in timing the supply of pigment from the oviduct. The negative correlation found between number and size of the spots (Table 3) suggests that this pigment supply does not vary strongly between eggs. b. Possible causes for variation in egg features. After this synopsis of the processes through which the egg is made we shall now consider how variations in size, shape, colour and speckling may be brought about, and whether such variations are likely to be under the control of genetical differences. An answer to the latter question is needed for a consideration of the possible influence of the mechanism of stimulus selection in the birds on the development of particular traits in egg features in the course of phylogeny. Large eggs contain relatively less yolk and more albumen than smaller ones (PARSONS, 1976). The main developmental factors determining the size of the egg must, therefore, be the amount of egg white added to the yolk in the magnum and the amount of fluid taken up by the white in the uterus, before the shell has become thick enough to stop the osmotic pro- cess. There is ample evidence that the feeding condition of the female in- fluences the egg white production and thus the egg size (ROMANOFF &amp; ROMANOFF, 1949); in particular the balance of amino-acids was found to be of importance (MARCH &amp; BIELY, 1963). This feeding condition is of course dependent on the amount of food available, but within a popula- tion differences among females should primarily be attributed to skill in foraging. This can be taken to be at least partly due to experience (red- billed gull, L. novaehollandiae; MILLS, 1979). Even the skill of the male</page><page sequence="39">26 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG partner was found to play a role, probably via his leadership in joint feeding early in the year and via the amount of food passed to the female during courtship (common tern; NISBET, 1973, NISBET &amp; DRURY, 1975). Egg size is also related with age. As a rule younger females lay smaller eggs, but this may, at least partly, again be due to a lower skill in forag- ing as compared with older more experienced birds. The eggs of repeat or replacement clutches tend to be smaller than the original ones; also in general the eggs of clutches laid later in the season are smaller (COULSON, 1963; PARSONS, 1975). A definite heritable basis for egg weight was found in selective breeding experiments carried out by VAN TIJEN &amp; KUIT (1970) in domestic fowl strains. From a study on the role of heredity in egg size variation in the great tit (Parus major) OJANEN, ORELL &amp; VAISANEN (1979) conclude that in these birds egg size should rapidly respond to differential selection pressures. Shape is primarily determined in the magnum but the isthmus may give it the finishing touch. If it is true that the speed at which the egg travels through the magnum determines the differences in appearance between the pointed and the blunt end (the more rapidly it travels the more egg white will be deposited behind the cross section of largest width of the egg, when it moves as a plunger through the lumen of the oviduct), slight differences in this basic form could be similarly explained. In addition the contractile wall of the isthmus might contribute to the variance in the egg shape, for instance - as suggested by CURTIS (1914) - through varia- tions in the co-ordination of the two layers of muscles in the oviduct wall. Such differences might be due to slight differences in the anatomy and physiology of females. A genetic basis for differences in egg shape was found in selective breeding experiments carried out with different strains of fowl by SHULTZ (1953) and VAN TIJEN &amp; KUIT (1970). MARBLE (1943) found that reciprocal crosses of lines of Barred Plymouth Rocks, selected for round and for long shape, showed an intermediate mean shape index in the F1 progeny. When considering the colouration of the egg we should take into account two different possible sources of pigment: the wall of the oviduct cranially of the uterus, and the uterus itself. We are inclined to believe that the speckles are produced by the flocculi descending from the former and that porphyrin from the uterine epithelium is involved in the production of the even groundcolour. The question should, however, be raised whether the uterus epithelium is producing the groundcolour alone. It seems likely to</page><page sequence="40">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 27 us that the brown pigment transported to the uterus from the cranial parts of the oviduct is also involved, because we found a strict coin- cidence between absence of speckles, or the presence of only abnormally few and often large deeply brown speckles, with a cyanotic groundcolour. Thus, when for some reason the supply of brown pigment is inadequate, cyanotic egg shells result. In our opinion this points to the uterine wall as the producer of only a blue pigment. When, as usual, the flow of brown pigment from the oviduct is abundant the blue seems to be mixed with traces of brown and, depending on the quantity of the latter, this turns the colour of the shell into greenish-brown (2ge on the Ostwald scale) or brown (2ni). This could be expected when the fluid carrying the brown pigment flocculi would also be brown, most probably through highly dispersed small particles of this brown pigment. With high magnification the apparently even colouration of brown hen eggs is found to be, at least partly, due to a large number of fine brown spots (SCHMIDT, 1958, 1963). The occurrence of secondary spots (i.e. speckles covered by a homogeneous coloured layer) besides uncovered primary spots shows that in a normally coloured egg the pigment is laid down in several layers on top of each other. The pigment containing fluid, entering the uterus from the cranial oviduct, can only reach the egg after the uterus epithelium has retracted from it. This fits the idea that firstly the uterine porphyrin would be secreted on the egg shell, directly by the uterine epithelium cells, that secondly this epithelium would retract from the egg shell, and that thirdly several 'showers' of lightly brown coloured fluid carrying flocculi would successively flow round the shell and settle on it. The more of these layers deposited and the higher the concentration of flocculi, the darker would become the egg. A sphincter at the entrance of the uterus, as reported by OTTOW and indeed found by us in the herring gull (Fig. 5a), seems well suited for the control for the pigment flow and could potentially determine the hue of the egg. The higher density and average size of the speckling in the a-zone and the often somewhat darker shade on the blunt pole of the egg also argue for an incoming flow of pig- ment from the rostral end of the uterus. This mechanism of pigmentation opens ample opportunity for varia- tion among the eggs of different females, as well as among different eggs of the same female, through differences in the component pigments and the relative amounts to which they are applied (the colour print principle; TAMMES, 1964). The genetics of colour differences in the eggs of different strains of fowl were studied by PUNNETT &amp; BAILEY (1920) in crosses of Brown Leghorn or</page><page sequence="41">28 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG Gold Pencilled Hamburgh strains (white eggs) with the Black Langshan strain (brown eggs). In the F1 intermediate colours were produced, the F2 showed the entire spectrum from brown over intermediate to white. As the brown eggs of fowl usually contain some small speckles it seems likely to us that the pigment from the cranial oviduct is involved. Genetic differences in shell colour were also found by GOODMAN &amp; SHEALEY (1977) in two strains which had been primarily selected on growth rate. The line with a high growth rate had the darker brown eggs, the line with low growth rate had eggs of cream colour. VOSBURGH (1948) has reported about crossing experiments between hens bred from the Chilean Araucana breed with blue eggs and several strains of domestic hens with brown eggs. In the progeny individuals occurred with green and olive- drab coloured eggs. As mentioned above, porphyrins play a role in egg pigmentation. Dif- ferences between porphyrins can have a genetic basis (KOEMAN, pers. comm.) and changes in porphyrins through pharmaca have been found to influence egg colour (MCCLAREY, 1955). c. The variation among eggs of individual females. Although it is generally believed that the characteristics of the eggs of in- dividual females tend to be constant, hard data in support of this opinion are still scarce. In accordance with our findings in the herring gull, VAN BREE (1952, 1957) had earlier found in the black-headed gull that the variance of length and width of the eggs within clutches is smaller than between clutches. However, to establish to what extent this is due to fac- tors specific to the individual female, the eggs of individual females should be checked in different clutches and in different years. COULSON (1963) measured in the kittiwake length, width, volume and shape (Wi l 00) in the same banded individuals in 5 successive years. He con- L cludes from this study that the yearly variations in length and width in the eggs of individual females are such that identification of a female on the basis of her eggs' characteristics in previous years would be possible only in a small minority of the gulls. Nevertheless it was possible to say that some females tended to lay long and others short eggs, and some broad and others narrow eggs. This implied the possibility for some in- dividuality in the shape of the eggs. In Barred Plymouth Rocks MARBLE (1943) found shape to be strikingly uniform among eggs laid by in- dividual females in different years.</page><page sequence="42">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 29 LABISKY &amp; JACKSON (1969) followed the colour of the eggs of 7 in- dividual pheasants in three successive years. In 2 of the hens the colour remained constant, in the others variations occurred, but not so much in the pure colour involved as in the strength of hue. In herring gulls we found in a number of cases the same characteristic egg type in successive years on almost the same site (variation &amp;lt; 5 m). Some of these clutches were easily distinguishable cyanotic ones and some of the birds concerned were banded and could be identified as the holders of the territory for 2-5 years. Generalising the data from different species we are tempted to con- clude that among the eggs of an individual female some variation of the features occurs but that the range of these variations among eggs of the same female tends to be smaller than among eggs of different females. Heritable factors are likely to be involved in maintaining the stereotypy of the eggs of an individual female. d. The oddity of the third egg. In all features investigated the C-egg showed a tendency to deviate from the other two eggs of the clutch. C-eggs had on the average a lower weight and smaller volume; both length and width tended to be smaller; the colour tended to be brighter. With regard to shape, C-eggs tended to be relatively shorter, thus less 'slender' than the others. The average number and size of the spots did not deviate in C-eggs, except for the bluish C-eggs in which spots, when present, tended to be large and small in number (similar bluish A- or B-eggs were not found). However, smear- or scribble-like spots occurred almost exclusively on terminal eggs. VERWEY (1924) and TAMMES (1928) have suggested that such elongated spots are formed when the egg turns in the uterus before pigmentation is completed. As a final check on the oddness of the C-egg we asked a panel of 10 per- sons to indicate in each of the clutches we had photographed (black and white) which egg of 90 clutches of three deviated the most from the other two eggs. They were simply asked to select the odd eggs in each clutch of three. The results are given in Table 9. The C-egg was correctly in- dicated in 528 of the 900 possibilities i.e. significantly more than random. Moreover, each person made the correct diagnosis more often than would be expected on the basis of chance. The table shows that a number of times either the A- or the B-egg was considered to be the odd one by a considerable majority of panel members. In such cases all criteria used (small size, light colour, few speckles, large speckles, smeared speckles)</page><page sequence="43">30 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG TABLE 9.

Some errors in the determination of the relative age of the three eggs of a clutch, for instance through recent death of one of the embryos on which this assessment was based, cannot be excluded. In 10 additional clutches the occurrence of one or more addled eggs made the a posteriori age determination anyway impossible. Between the A- and B-eggs a difference was found for two features only: B-eggs were more often the largest of the clutch and had more often fewer speckles. PARSONS (1970) found the average amount of yolk to be highest in B-eggs. Deviation of the C-egg has been reported before in the Laridae. PALUDAN (1951) and PARSONS (1970) found in the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull, PRESTON &amp; PRESTON (1953) in the laughing gull, COULSON (1963) in the kittiwake, and GEMPERLE &amp; PRESTON (1955) and GOCHFELD (1977) in the common tern, lower values for the average volume of the C-egg. In all these species the width of the C-egg was lower than that of the other two eggs of the same clutch. The same was true for the length, with one exception: in the kittiwake the mean length of the</page><page sequence="44">EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE EGG 31 B-egg was the smallest. The C-egg was the most slender one in the kit- tiwake, the laughing gull and the common tern, but in contrast (this dif- ference, confirmed by our measurements, is not mentioned in COULSON'S text), the least slender one in the herring gull and the black-backed gull. This fully agrees with our findings. The tendency for the C-egg to be paler was also reported by GEMPERLE &amp; PRESTON (1955) and by GOCHFELD (1977) in the common tern. The occurrence of vermiform spots on C-egg is mentioned by GEMPERLE and PRESTON but no detailed data are given. All features of the odd C-egg could be interpreted as the result of a slight change in the timing of the production process of this egg. The smaller size is mainly due to a smaller amount of egg white (PARSONS, 1976). The lighter colour is likely to be the result of a smaller number of pigment layers and the frequent occurrence of smears indicates that often the egg is already leaving the uterus before pigmentation has been fully completed. Yet, as established by DRENT (1970) and PARSONS (1976) for the herring gull and by YTREBERG (1960) for the black-headed gull and the common gull, the laying intervals A-B and B-C are not significantly different. Obviously the passage of the C-egg through the entire tract is not speeded up, thus must the rate of the processes involved in making the egg have slowed down. This fits the hypothesis posed by PALUDAN (1951) and PARSONS (1972, 1976) that from the time the A-egg is laid and incubated the egg production processes become inhibited. PARSONS argued on substantial grounds that this is functional because the smaller size of the C-egg reduces its incubation time by 8-14 hours. The later the C-chick hatches after its siblings the lower is its chance to survive the first weeks; the hatching success of C-eggs was found to be equal to that of the other eggs. On the other hand chick survival is highly positively cor- related with egg size. A delicate balance between these conflicting factors, amounts of reserve food and synchronization of hatching, seems to have been established. 5. Conclusion As a preliminary to the investigation of the effectiveness of different egg- features for releasing incubation responses the average values of the following characteristics were determined: weight, volume, length, width, shape, number of spots, size of the spots, groundcolour and spot colour. The variance of all these characteristics among the entire popula- tion of 300 eggs from 100 clutches was found to be significantly larger than the variance within these clutches.</page><page sequence="45">32 BAERENDS &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG This implies that the three eggs laid in succession by a female tend to be homogeneous with respect to these characteristics. Since no measurements were made on different clutches of the same female, either in one year or in different years, the data do not yet permit to conclude that females lay eggs with individually specific characters throughout their life. However, a consideration of the mechanisms by means of which the appearance of the egg is brought about suggests several possibilities through which individual specificity could be attained, some of which are likely to be under genetic control. A tendency was found for the last laid egg of a clutch to deviate from the other two. It tends to weigh slightly less, be more slender and somewhat shorter, and more brightly coloured, with fewer and larger spots. Smearshaped spots were far more often found on the last laid egg than on the others. This oddity can also be interpreted on the basis of anatomical and physiological features of the egg-producing mechanisms.</page><page sequence="46">SECTION II THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT EGG FEATURES FOR THE EGG-RETRIEVAL RESPONSE CHAPTER 1 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING STIMULUS EFFECTIVENESS by G. P. BAERENDS 1. Introduction The effectiveness of various visual stimuli for eliciting incubation responses was studied by means of dummies on which many quantitative and qualitative modifications of different features could be applied in dif- ferent combinations. In two ways one can obtain from a gull an evalua- tion of the acceptibility of a particular object for incubation: 1) one can offer a test clutch in the gull's nest and ascertain whether the gull in- cubates or refuses it, and 2) one can put the test object on the nest rim and ascertain whether it is retrieved into the nest-bowl or not. For both cases direct observation of the birds from a hide yields the most information. Since this is very time-consuming we also investigated the suitability, as an alternative method, of a periodic control of nests in which egg-dummies had either been placed on-the nest-rim or inside the nest-bowl. The temperature of the eggs at control visits and changes of position of markings placed on the shell were used as indications for at- tendance. Although we did find some differences between the percentage of different classes of dummies retrieved (real egg and standard wooden dummy: 75%; abnormal groundcolour or shape: 30%; strongly reduced size: 20%) and of the attendance of nests with different types of dummies (see III.2.a.), this method proved to be unsatisfactory. Its sensitivity was low because it appeared that almost all egg dummies were retrieved from the nest rim sooner or later. Hence, direct observation of latency time and behaviour was needed to reveal to us any discrimination by the bird. Second, the repeated control of a sufficient number of nests causes long periods of disturbance in the colony which imply an interference likely to</page><page sequence="47">34 G. P. BAERENDS overshadow any differences in nest-attendance of alien elements in the clutch. Third, one has to realize that nest-attendance not only depends on the effectiveness of the dummies as incubation-releasing objects - which is the subject of this study - but also as objects providing the satisfactory feedback (see Part I, p. 167 and Section 2B), necessary for the maintenance of incubation behaviour. This feedback will probably be provided by normally shaped dummies of abnormal colouration, but not by abnormally shaped or abnormally sized ones. To compare the effectiveness of different substitutes, two basically dif- ferent methods may be used. One can either present each of the different dummies successively in or on the nest, or one can offer two or more of them simultaneously, either in dummy-nests of like appearance replacing the original one or on equivalent sites on the nest-rim, so that the gull has to make a choice. Both methods have their pros and cons. First, as always in attempts to measure the effect of external stimulation, one has to be aware of the fact that stimuli always cause responses in interaction with specific internal factors (BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATERBOLK, 1955). The strength of these factors should be expected to fluctuate on the long as well as on the short term. This means that for a comparison of the effectiveness of different stimulus situations one has either, in each test, to measure or monitor in- dependently the level of the internal state, or one has to make sure that the comparisons can be taken to have been made with reference to a given level of that state. This latter condition can be fulfilled in two ways: a) by running for each dummy a large number of repetitions of the same test, randomly distributed among tests with other dummies, over time and over different birds, so that the internal state can statistically be assumed constant; and b) by presenting two or more dummies simultaneously. Methods for assessing qualitative and quantitative dif- ferences of the internal state only gradually emerged from our study; they could not play a role, therefore, in determining the design of our ex- periments from the beginning. Statistical neutralization of the fluctua- tions in the internal state was technically not feasible. The tests lasted too long and the number of workable days was too small to achieve the numbers of tests needed for that purpose. Moreover, as will become clear from the following discussion of our techniques, a random distribution of the experiments over birds would have involved too much disturbance in the colony and was likely to produce less useful information than could be obtained otherwise. We therefore decided on simultaneous presentation</page><page sequence="48">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 35 of dummies, thus on choice tests, to ensure a high sensitivity of our measurements. In pilot experiments we tried out the possibility of presenting the dum- mies in clutches of two or three in dummy nests and that of presenting two dummies side by side on the nest rim. Initially we were inclined to believe that the nest-choice technique would provide us with clearer answers, since in such tests the two stimulus situations were further apart, so that the bird actually had to commit itself to one of the alter- natives, whereas with the two eggs close on the nest-rim the bird could almost effortlessly correct its decision. However, the nest-choice experi- ment turned out to be much less suitable. It caused much more distur- bance to the birds, and if they regularly came back to the nest strong site preferences quickly developed. Consequently we accepted egg-retrieval as the major criterion for 'egg-recognition' in our experiments. To obtain an impression whether the results obtained this way were likely to hold also for other experimental techniques we did a limited number of nest- choice and successive presentation experiments. A comparison of the data collected with these different techniques will be given in III.1. We are convinced that our method of simultaneous presentation of two dummies gave us a much better insight in the relative effectiveness of dif- ferent egg features with respect to incubation responses than successive presentation could have done. However, we have to be aware that the two methods might possibly not answer exactly the same question. From their analysis of the egg retrieval act of the greylag goose LORENZ &amp; TINBERGEN (1939) concluded that this act consists of a pattern-setting core-component, the actual fixed pattern or 'Erbkoordination' and an orienting component, the 'Taxis'. It could be argued that with successive presentation the effect of the different features on the elicitation of retrieving is primarily measured, but with simultaneous presentation the effect on orientation of the response (TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK, 1950). In some cases (Philanthus; TINBERGEN, 1935; Notonecta; BAERENDS, 1950) dif- ferent components of the external situation were found to elicit and to direct an activity. In the final discussion of our results (V.5) and their in- terpretation we shall come back to this problem. 2. Technique of the experiments The two dummies to be simultaneously tested were placed on the nest rim, their long axes at right angles to the radius of the nests, not more than 2 cm apart, and if asymmetrical in the same direction. As the herring gull is not as skilful in egg-rolling as for instance the greylag</page><page sequence="49">36 G. P. BAERENDS goose, the dummies should not be placed outside the nest-rim (cf. STEIN- BACHER, 1931; GOETHE, 1937), and no obstruction should prevent them from being easily shifted into the nest-bowl. However, it is advisable to put the egg into a slight depression in the nest-rim, otherwise it might roll by itself as soon as the gull settles on the nest. At the beginning of each series of consecutive tests one standard dummy was always left in the nest-bowl. However, when a gull had during at least two successive tests settled on the nest without retrieving one of the two dummies, the nest- bowl was left empty at the start of the following test. As set forth on p. 173 of Part I, emptying the nest-bowl enhances the tendency to retrieve eggs from the nest-rim. Immediately after having laid out the test the assistant left, leaving the observer in a blind placed at 5-10 m distance from the nest. As soon as the helper was out of sight the bird on duty used to land on one of the 'roost-sites' in its territory. From there it usually walked to the nest within a few minutes. After arrival on the nest the bird might sit down before retrieving the first dummy (for which it had to rise again) or it retrieved from the standing position, usually at once or after a brief delay. Sometimes the second model was retrieved immediately after the first one, sometimes it followed after a varying period of incubation and sometimes it was not retrieved at all. As a rule the assistant returned every 20 minutes for laying out a new test. The same observer usually stayed in the hide for several tests in a row. The series of tests used to be continued for as long as the bird kept returning well within the 20-minute test period. A period of reluctance to come back to the nest could be temporarily overcome by allowing the bird to sit undisturbed on the full clutch during one or two test periods. Also, starting a test with a real egg or a very attractive dummy in the nest in- stead of the standard dummy or an empty nest, could make the bird ac- cessible for some additional tests. Generally we restricted the use of such tricks to attempts to obtain controls needed to complete a series. Other- wise we preferred to leave the bird alone for the time being and to move to another one. In the beginning of the season the birds were more easily disturbed and gave up sooner than later on. In the second half of the in- cubation season we often made series of 20 or more consecutive tests with one bird. As much as possible of the activities of the gull was noted down to the nearest minute during the entire test period. These data were later transferred to punch cards in order to make computer-processing of the data possible.</page><page sequence="50">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 37 To make sure that the dummy retrieved first was not just chosen at random, or because it happened to be in a position on the nest which was preferred by the bird, the position of both dummies had to be exchanged in another test of the same series. Mostly a gull tends to prefer some posi- tions on the nest-rim over the others to a varying extent. In case this posi- tion preference dominates the results of one pair of tests with the same dummies the score is 1:1; such tests will be called minus-tests (-). In case of a 2:0 score a preference for one of the dummies is indicated; such tests will be called plus-tests (+ ). When no such diagnosis could be made the code (0) will be used. Already during the first season we learned that position preference is a quantitative phenomenon (11.2.3.). It tends to increase in strength when the more effective model of a pair is occupying the same position in con- secutive tests. If the experimenter does not systematically repress this tendency the gull will soon become useless for further tests. Position preference can be kept in check by choosing for a following test such dummies and such positons that the bird is likely to retrieve first from a position different from that of the first choice in the preceding test. This does not imply that it is advisable to use as much as possible entirely dif- ferent sites in consecutive tests. On the contrary, after much experimen- tation, we found it the best procedure to start a series of tests with a par- ticular bird by searching for two adjacent, almost equally evaluated, sites and keep to them as long as possible. Such sites could be found by work- ing through consecutive presentations of pairs of moderately different dummies (for instance a normally sized dummy with a slightly oversized one). Apart from conditioning to a particular position we also had indica- tions that temporary conditioning to a particular dummy can take place when that dummy features in consecutive tests. This effect also had to be taken into account when choosing the dummies for the next test. The necessity of avoiding these two types of conditioning during the tests made a presentation of dummy pairs in a predetermined randomiz- ed order senseless. Incidental disturbances in the course of a test, in par- ticular the relief of a bird by its mate, would also seriously interfere with such a pre-arranged order. As a consequence we decided for a procedure which we called 'playing chess with the gull'. This meant that the set-up for a following test was designed to confirm or reject an apparent dummy preference in the preceding test. For this purpose we often needed more than two tests in a row; already at least three tests are necessary to check for the influence of position preference on the first retrieval of one par-</page><page sequence="51">38 G. P. BAERENDS ticular dummy of a pair, without presenting identical dummies in tests directly following one another. On the other hand one should try to reach a conclusion from the smallest number of tests possible, because of the ever present chance that the bird tested is relieved by its mate, a chance which is greater in the beginning of the season, when the partners are often both present in the territory, than later on when the attentive shifts may last for 6 hours or longer. The procedure followed is illustrated in Fig. 6a. Actually it were such series of tests that gave us the most convincing evidence about the relative 1 2 3 8 8 12 8 RP8 8 (unspeckled) 4 5 6 8 12 8 RP8 (unspeckled) Fig. 6a.

The circles represent the nest in the test situation; two dummies on the nest- rim, one in the nest-bowl. Three pairs of dummies are presented: a normally sized dummy (code 8) against one with all linear dimensions 11/2 x enlarged (code 12), a normally-sized and shaped dummy (8) against an equally sized block shaped one (RB8), and a speckled dummy against an unspeckled egg-shaped one, both of normal size 8.

Therefore, in the presentation of our data on stimulus selection we have chosen to pool the data obtained in each experiment (= series of tests in which the same pair of dummies was presented). In these cases we have abstained from calculations of statistical reliabilities of the results because - considering the way the data was collected - this would not be justified. However, while working in the field we used as an off-hand rule that each experiment was repeated until application of a binomial table yielded at least a p-value &amp;lt; 0.05. The scores from the pooled data were never in disagree- ment with the results from 'chess-playing' with the gulls. The experimental work was all done in the field, until 1960 in a bird sanctuary on the Bosplaat on the island of Terschelling (53025'N;</page><page sequence="52">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 39 landing 1n On START ST AS Fig. 6b.

P. BAERENDS 5°27' E) in later years in a protected area on the isle of Schiermonnikoog (53°29'N; 6°15'E). Within these colonies, comprising 1000-2000 birds, the distances between nests varied from 3 to 20 m. For our tests we selected nests which were well visible from a distance of 8-10 m. This im- plied that we preferred nests in a low and/or open vegetation over nests in high grass or dense bushes. Apart from blocking one's view dense vegeta- tion also tends to restrict the movements of the bird on the nest and in this way seems to promote site-preference in egg retrieving (see IV. 1.). When looking for birds and nests suitable for testing we in general tended to prefer gulls which were attacking us from the air when we walk- ed in the colony. We had the impression that such birds were also less easily disturbed by the manipulations with their clutches, the presence of a cubic meter canvas blind at 5-8 m from the nest and the repeated visits of people. If possible we selected a number of nests at distances of circa 25 m from each other, each provided with a blind, which could be served in one run by one visit of the assistant. To reduce the time of disturbance by such visits we preferred nests in small hollows surrounded by dunes, which made it easier for the helper to approach for a long distance unobserved and, when leaving, to be soon out of sight. The observer should not be visible to the birds during the test and no alarm calls should be heard, since disturbances - even slight ones - easily influence the behaviour of the incubating bird. When it was decided to use a particular nest for testing, the original clutch was exchanged for three normally sized and shaped brown dum- mies with dark and grey speckles ( = standard dummy). Very often the bird went on incubating the wooden clutches for 7-10 days beyond their normal incubation time. For the first tests to be given to a bird egg-dummies were chosen of which we knew that they were acceptable to most birds. In this way a bird became gradually habituated to the tests. Some birds were easier to work with than others; we did not aim at spreading the tests evenly over all birds but we always made sure that for each experiment a number of dif- ferent birds were tested. We usually started our experiments about May 15, roughly one week after the first eggs had been found. In the first 10 days of the incubation period birds were more frightened by the test situation and more readily gave up than later on. As soon as young have hatched in the nest tests are no longer possible because the eggs and dummies are no longer retrieved; the tendency to retrieve appears to have completely subsided. Moreover we often had the impression that in the last week of the incubation phase 40</page><page sequence="54">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 41 the presence of chicks in neighbouring territories negatively influenced incubation behaviour and retrieval of test birds. In order to have incubating gulls available as long as possible during the season we added new experimental areas about every two or three weeks, arresting development by shaking the eggs vigorously. The eggs would have been shaken anyway since this was the method by which the conservation authorities tried to keep the population under control. Thanks to differences between individual gulls in small details of their faces (shape of head, area around eyes, slight markings on bill), of the plumage (black areas on wing tips) and of behavioural idiosyncrasies (preferred routes through territory) and to the fact that neighbours and strangers are not allowed on the territory, we were able to identify our ex- perimental birds without the need of marking them. Male and female could always be distinguished on the relative size and often on a slight difference in head shape. Although the size ranges of the sexes overlap, we always found the male of a pair to be larger than his female; the head of females is usually more rounded than that of the male. All dummies were lathed from wood, preferably beech-wood. They were painted with oil paint to which turpentine was added to prevent the paint layer from developing a shine. Details about shape, size and col- ouration of the dummies will be given throughout this Section at the ap- propriate places. No indications were ever obtained that stimuli other than visual ones are effective in inducing the first responses to eggs or egg dummies on the nest-rim. The gulls did not respond differently to eggs made of different kinds of material (wood, glass, plastic, plasticine, metal) or treated with different kinds of paint. Neither did we ever find effects of the temperature of the eggs or dummies on the initial response. MARPLES (1932) found ringed plovers to respond indiscriminately to eggs rubbed with the skin of oranges and untreated eggs. Dummies heavier than a normal egg were readily retrieved, a heavy weight even seemed to stimulate the retrieval effort. This is in agreement with the findings of other authors (CULEMANN, 1928; GOETHE, 1937) who have experimented with herring gulls. POULSEN (1953) offered egg dummies varying in weight from 15 to 330 g to geese (egg weight 100-140 g); all dummies were equally promptly and smoothly retrieved. He also found pigeons to retrieve eggs from 3 to 100 g (own egg 15 g).</page><page sequence="55">42 G. P. BAERENDS 3. Characteristics of the behaviour of the gulls during the test A schematical survey of the main proceedings during the tests has been given in Fig. 6b. When after the departure of the helper the alarm in the colony is dying down the gull alights in the territory on a roosting spot. The latency period passing between landing in the territory and stepping into the nest has been called to. After landing the bird may keep its neck stretched (anxiety upright), for a while looking around and initially often uttering the kekeke alarm- call. The longer it takes before the gull further approaches the nest the higher the chance that it will perform preening. Often an alarmed bird may walk, or more rarely fly, from one position in the territory to another. In most cases one or more trails through the vegetation lead to the nest. Shortly before approaching the nest the gull usually lowers its head. It then mostly walks as far as the nest-bowl and steps into it, keep- ing the neck in the relaxed position. Sometimes the bird may pick up a straw; a sure sign that it intends to proceed to the nest. Occasionally a bird may halt at a short distance in front of the nest, resume the alarm position and possibly start preening, or it returns to the roost. Some birds have the habit of covering short distances within the territory on the wing, especially when using the hide as a roosting place. Such birds may alight on or very near the nest but this occurs much more rarely than ap- proach on foot. The latency-period between arrival on the nest and retrieval of the first dummy is called t1. Once in the nest-bowl the gull usually orients towards the dummies on the nest-rim, moving its head slowly from one dummy to the other and back, the bill pointing diagonally downwards. It may retrieve one or both models before settling down (while still standing, code ST) or only after having been sitting for some period (after settling, code AS). In both cases, however, retrieving is carried out from a standing or slightly crouching position. The bill is brought behind the egg or dummy at about the middle of its axis after which the object is moved towards the body and into the nest-bowl. Continuously the dummy is shifted in position in the nest-bowl against the brood patches. In case of abnormally shaped and/or sized dummies this may take a long time and may even, with short interruptions, go on during the tests when the shape of the egg dummy precludes a normal position. During prolonged shifting and settling soft nestle-sounds are continuously made and even in cool weather the gull may pant with increasing intensity (Plate XIII).</page><page sequence="56">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 43 The period between retrieval of the first and second dummy is called t2. Often the second dummy is retrieved immediately after the first one, but the gull may also settle down in between. The period from retrieval of the second dummy until the end of the 20-min test is called t3. Not infrequently the second dummy is left on the nest-rim during the rest of the test period; in that case t2 becomes the final period of the test and is of the same order or length as t3. Interruptive activities (see Part I, pp. 152, 280) may occur during the whole test but especially during the final period (II.2.4.). Most interrup- tive behaviour on the nest consists of re-settling and/or building; preen- ing is less common while standing or sitting on the nest. We shall see that the occurrence of interruptive activities can be an aid to interpreting the response of the gull to dummies in some cases. Incompleteness of clutches may induce these activities and so do abnormally sized or -shaped dum- mies after having been rolled into the nest-bowl. The occurrence of interruptive behaviour may also increase when a dummy remains on the nest-rim. It is difficult to decide in how far this is directly caused by characteristics of this dummy and/or by the conse- quence that its absence from the clutch in the nest-bowl causes deficiency of the feedback. However, since retrieval has a lower threshold than in- terruptive behaviour (Part I, p. 202) it must be primarily the features of the dummy that inhibit retrieval to occur in such cases. Three other reactions may be seen when a gull abstains from retrieving a dummy. Firstly the gull may settle, often repeatedly with its flank directed towards the dummy or dummy-pair. Secondly, mostly in that position, it may cover the dummy with nest material. Thirdly, it may set- tle on the nest with its tail over the dummy or dummies on the rim, thus facing away from them (termed cut off by CHANCE, 1962). While sitting on the eggs the position of the gull may vary from com- pletely relaxed (even sleeping with the bill tucked into the back feathers) to looking around with a stretched neck in the upright alarmed position (Part I, p. 252) or upright and ventilating (panting) when it is hot. Especially at the end of a parental shift a bird may frequently scan the sky, with one eye and the head askew. The oblique and long call is also in particular performed at these moments. Yawning occurred from time to time, but not often enough to correlate it with other behavioural characteristics. Head shaking and head rotating (Part I, p. 244) have in the data been pooled with preening activities. Collecting trips were rare and practically restricted to the to and t -periods and to cases in which dummies very abnormal and con-</page><page sequence="57">44 G. P. BAERENDS spicuous in size, shape, or colour were lying on the nest-rim. This is in accordance with our opinion expressed in Part I (p. 281) that collecting trips are promoted by a combination of relatively high tendencies to in- cubate and to flee. A number of times it was seen that a bird refusing to return to the nest and standing preening on its roost immediately went to the nest after it had started to rain. On the other hand rain blocks retrieval, probably in- hibiting the bird from rising.</page><page sequence="58">CHAPTER 2 SIZE by G. P. BAERENDS, G. J. BLOKZIJL and R. H. DRENT 1. Introduction The importance of the character 'size' in releasing and directing incuba- tion responses was chiefly investigated by means of a series of dummies of normal egg shape, comprising stepwise increments in size. Because we were also interested in the question how far length and width of an object, more or less independently of volume, play a role in determining its ac- ceptibility as an incubation object, in another series of dummies we also varied these dimensions. This, however, automatically implied varying their shape, which either became elongated or longitudinally compress- ed. In order to avoid a possible conditioning to particular dummies, as well as for verifying the provisional interpretation of a previous test with our 'chess-playing' technique, we often gave dummies of the normally and abnormally proportioned series in competition or alternation. Con- sequently it is appropriate to deal in the same chapter with the results of tests with equally and unequally shaped dummies of different size. 2. Material and technique The dummies were all made of wood and painted brown with black and grey speckles to resemble the natural egg of the herring gull. This coloration, to which we shall refer as 'standard colour', will be described in 1I.1.4. The dummies had originally been designed by N. TINBERGEN (1953) for his herring gull studies at the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Ieiden. After these studies had been discontinued the dummies were kindly put at our disposal and the series extended as occasion demanded. The size of the dummies varied from one-half to twice the linear dimensions of the average real egg ('standard size'). In the series of normally shaped dummies all linear dimensions (i.e. the short and the long axis of the egg) differed in successive models in steps of 1/8 of the standard size. Correspondingly they are named by a code ranging from 4 to 16 (= 4/8 to 16/8 of the standard dimensions, respectively). The abnormally shaped dummies were obtained by varying the longest axis (the length of the egg) in a similar stepwise fashion while keeping the shortest axis (width of the egg) constant, and by varying the width while keeping the length constant. Each was done for the sizes 4, 6, 12 and 16. The contours of these models were rounded, and we strove to re- tain as much of the typical egg shape as was still possible for the given linear dimensions.

Maximal projection was measured by projecting the shadow of the model in a beam of parallel light on a sheet of paper, marking off the cir- cumference and measuring the surface with a planimeter. In the 1690 tests we made in the experiments on size and proportion 86 different gulls were used, 38 females, 28 males and 20 gulls of which the sex remained unidentified. 3. Results a. Difference in size but similarity in shape. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 11. For all tests taken together (column 4) 592 times the bigger dummy of a pair was chosen first, against 299 times the smaller one. This preference for the bigger over the smaller dummy holds for all scores in column 4, except for the (12 x 10) experiment; most other differences are highly significant, according to the sign-test. A considerable amount of first choices for the smaller (and an equal amount of first choices for the bigger model) is due to position preference, (i.e. cases in which smaller and bigger models were taken from the same</page><page sequence="60">TABLE 11.

Such tests will further be indicated as minus tests (-). Their distribution over the different ex- periments is shown in column 6 and 7. If these clear position preference tests are left out (column 8) all scores show the preference for the bigger egg and the proportion selecting b increases. In our interpretation we have mostly relied on this category. It comprises clear classes of tests not dominated by position preference, or plus tests ( + ), as well as tests for which no reliable diagnosis on the relative influence of rim position was possible (O-tests). In the present series this latter group consists of 109 tests. If we also subtract the 0-tests the scores appear as in column 9. After this treatment a preference for the smaller dummy has still remain- ed in 19% of the tests. Column 10 lists the number of individual birds in- volved in each experiment of the series. Column 11 gives the number of times a single bird scored in favour of the bigger or of the smaller model of a pair, but only when the difference between both scores made by the bird in that experiment amounted to at least 2 (the same experiment was rarely repeated more than 5 times with the same bird). These figures strongly support the conclusion that in general the bigger egg model is preferred over the smaller one. But also with this method for evaluating the scores it turns out that consistent preferences for the smaller dummy may from time to time occur. We shall come back to the causation of these 'consistent minority choices' later in this chapter. The dominance of position preference in a test could always be broken in a succeeding test by increasing the difference in size between the models of a pair. This shows that the preferences for position and for the characteristics of the dummies are processed by the bird as quantities which are computed for determining the final response. This quantitative character of the positon preference we shall use here to investigate as a first question which parameters of the models the gull is likely to use when comparing dummies of different size. The dummies were designed to differ in volume; however it is not likely that the birds will be able to use that parameter directly. A comparison of the size of the projection of the models on the retina seems physiologically more feasible. Some results of our experiments on the relative importance of 'shape' have in fact indicated that this latter parameter is used. Although gulls in general preferred block-shaped models with rounded edges over similar models with sharp edges, some individual gulls tended to retrieve the sharp edg- ed dummies first. The same gulls were found to be very sensitive to dif- ferences in size (which might mean that they had no preference for either</page><page sequence="62">SIZE 49 ( VOLUME 300 1.7 2.2 2.9 4.0 6.0 8.6 18.3 20.0 40.0 550 250 1.3 1.3 7 2.3 1 3.5 5.0 7.8 11.7 23.3 .._ , _ .....

When we ourselves looked at rounded and sharp edged blocks which had been carefully made of equal volume, the sharp edged ones seemed to us larger and comparison of their shadows on a plane in a beam of parallel light proved the maximum projection obtainable (by turning the blocks around in the beam) from the sharp edged blocks to be about 4% larger than that of the rounded ones. Consequently we have considered volume (V) and maximum projec- tion (MP) as possibilities for the parameter involved and for both we have asked whether for comparison differences or ratios might be used by the birds. The figures concerned for all pairs of egg-shaped dummies are shown in the diagrams of Fig. 7. These diagrams make it possible to find different pairs of dummies, which could be predicted to break a par- ticular position preference appearing with the presentation of another pair of models, in case the gull would use any of the four parameters: V-ratio, V-difference, MP-ratio and MP-difference. Thus, by an ap- propriate choice of the pairs of models presented to the gull in consecutive attempts to break the position preference, it is possible to eliminate parameters and ultimately find out which of them is actually used by the gull. Fig. 8 gives an example of such a sequence of tests. Here a preference exists for the front position, which after 6 unsuccessful at- tempts is only broken when combination (6 x 10) is offered with model 10 in the rear position (test 1170). In this combination the MP-ratio and both the MP- and the V-differences have values exceeding those of com- bination (5 x 9) (test 1169), therefore only the V-ratio is eliminated. Two tests later, however, pair (9 x 12) (test 1172) is not able to break the posi- tion preference although for this combination both differences are larger. Consequently the MP-ratio is the only effective parameter left. That neither of the differences is used is further corraborated by the final three tests 1174, 1175 and 1176 of the series. In addition to this kind of comparison of the results of long series of successive tests we have also determined how often - in all the relevant tests made during the course of the study (i.e. a greater number of tests and more variation in dummy size than is represented in Table 11)- each of the different pairs of egg-shaped dummies presented had been able to break a position preference dominating in the preceding test at the presentation of another pair. In total 313 of such observations were made. Table 12 shows for each of the four types of comparisons suggested the extent to which the explanation would not cover the data found. Maximum projecting ratio (MPR) turns out to give the best fit (93%).</page><page sequence="64">SIZE 51 June 24,1960 1164 1165 1166 1167 1 . 5 - ^ 1 . 9 " 1 .7 - 2 . 5 2.1 32.1 \ 5.0 80-- 105, 110__ 120 _ 7 6 8 5 1168 1169 1170 1171 1.7- X 2.5 2.8 1.9- 2.1 5.0 4.7 2.7 208 8 317 9 10 267 11 110'-_ 120-_ 165,_ 170__ 10 5 6 8 1172 1173 1174 1175 2.1' 2.5" 2.5 3.7 2.3 \ 3.5 3.5 7.0 367 12 416 12 '416 _1 8 358 10 200._ 250- 250- 180,_ 9 i 8 12 5 1176 1177 1178 1179 3.1 - 3.2 3.7 4.0 6.0 ,5.0 7.0 7.8 -~ 0^--~~ 0.^~--~0^ 0 376 11 483 12 358 10 525 12 225_ _^ 280 . 180 _ 305. -C 6 7 5 6 1180 1181 1182 1183 2.5- 1.9 2.8 3.7 5.0 1 2.7 ,4.7 7.0 i 0 -i 0 0 $ 0 120--_.. 170-.. 165._.-. 180..,,- 5 8 6 5 1184 1185 1186 .. 2.5 " 3.1 3.3 M.R ratio 3.5 6.0 5.0 Vol. ratio 176 12 376 11 483 s12 M.P difference 250.. 225. 280.

With the exactitude possible in these measurements no observation con- tradicting this assumption was ever made. That in Table 12 all three alternative explanations show a rather good degree of fit is due to the fact that in the 313 observations considered pairs of highly different dummies, far exceeding the position preference, frequently occurred. For different pairs of dummies (those included in Table 11, completed with suitable tests carried out later in the context of experiments dealt TABLE 12.

A significant positive correlation was found (r =0.34, p&lt;0.02, D.F. = 45). The best explanation for this relation seems that the probability of overcoming position preference increases with the size dif- ference between the dummies presented. In fact, for the same data a cor- responding negative correlation (r= -0.36) was found between the MP- ratio of the dummy pair presented and the percentage of tests in which position preference dominated. b. Difference in size and shape. The results of this series of experiments are given in Table 13. The dif- ferent model pairs are arranged in such a way that in the upper part of the table the bigger dummy is also the most normally shaped one while in the lower part the smaller dummy has the better egg-shape. Again the effect of size dominates the results of these experiments. The size differences are obviously more important to the gulls than the dif- ferences in shape. Still, the percentage of tests in which the bigger dum- my was taken first is for all categories slightly higher when this dummy was egg-shaped (Table 11, Table 13, upper half) then when it had abnor-</page><page sequence="66">TABLE 13.

In case of a preference for normal over abnormal shape one would expect suppression of first choices for the bigger egg when it is abnormally shaped and facilitation when it is egg- shaped. The interference of preference for larger size and for egg-shape in the size and proportion series can be clearly demonstrated by plotting the percentage first choices for the bigger dummy (column 5 in Table 13) against the MP-ratio of more egg-shaped over less egg-shaped dummies (column 2).

Relations between percentage first choices for the bigger dummy and maximum projection ratio for combinations of two dummies of different sizes, one of normal, the other of abnormal length/width proportions. The dots indicate the direction of preferences for each combination. Data of Table 13. and of the percentage of choices for the bigger dummy the points representing dummy pairs of which the more normally shaped dummy was in majority retrieved first, tend to diverge from those combinations in which the more abnormally shaped one was first taken. This means that for an abnormally shaped dummy to be preferred to a normally shaped one the size difference should be considerably larger than for an egg-shaped one to be preferred over a dummy of aberrant shape. Another possibility to assess the effect of shape is to compare sets of unequally shaped dummies which differ slightly or not at all in maximum projection surface. Three such sets are shown in Fig. 10. The scores,</page><page sequence="68">SIZE 7-9 1-1 18W6L elongated 60-60 compressed 6W8 5-5- \ 30-33 / 8W8L) normal Fig. 10.

A preference for the normal over both types of abnormal shapes is clear but between the two abnormal shapes the scores cannot be considered to dif- Ter. Yet, in successive tests we frequently found it possible to break a position preference with the compressed dummy when the equally large elongated dummy failed. Moreover, the compressed dummy scored somewhat higher against the egg-shaped one than the elongated dummy. This suggests that thickness, or height above the nest rim, is more impor- tant in determining the effect than egg length. 55</page><page sequence="69">56 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; I)RENT In our opinion the data of this mixed 'size and proportion' series leave no doubt that shape plays a role in egg recognition. The data indicate that this shape effect is overruled by a 15-20% difference in size. However, the character 'shape' should actually be studied in dummies of equal size. This will be considered in 11.3. 4. Discussion a. The causation of minority choices. The occurrence of consistent minority preferences in individuals. First the question should be raised whether a consistent preference for the smaller dummy of a pair might be an idiosyncrasy of some individual birds. The answer can be obtained by looking at the records made for each individual bird in each experiment (= combination of two particular dummies) to which they were subjected. The result of this investigation has been summarized in Table 14. This table shows how often the score made by a bird for all tests of an experiment was in favour of the larger and of the smaller dummy. As such all scores were considered in which (per bird) the difference was at least 2. Mostly tests of the same experi- ment could not be repeated often enough with one bird (on the average 4.9 times) to obtain a score significantly in favour of one of the dummies. The results of tests clearly dominated by position preference (paired 1-1 choices after a second presentation of the same dummy pair in reversed positions) have been omitted from this table, but single presentations of a dummy pair for which no position preference control could be made (0-tests) are included. Therefore, the data must still contain a certain amount of results dominated by position preference. In Table 14 a distinction is made between cases of birds making the same kind of choice in merely one or in more experiments. In only 6 series the scores for the smaller dummy exceeded those for the larger one with at least two tests in more than one experiment. In fact this occurred in 6 birds with two different dummy combinations. However, against these series exist for three of these birds, respectively, 17, 10 and 2 series showing a majority preference for the bigger model; it is, therefore, clear that they were not consistently preferring the smaller dummy. For the remaining three birds the picture is different. The data obtained for these birds, summarized in Table 15, show that they made 19 times a minority choice against 6 ma- jority ones. Of the latter, five tests concern choices in favour of a normal sized dummy over an undersized one: 4 x (8W8L vs 8W4L), 1 x (12 vs 6).</page><page sequence="70">SIZE 57 TABLE 14.

Thus, out of the 172 consistent minority choices in the plus-group (Tables 11 and 13, column 9) we have for only 19 tests no grounds for re- jecting the possibility that the consistent preference for the smaller egg might be an individual characteristic. Since this makes this hypothesis very unlikely we have looked for other explanations. A lead to such an ex- planation was suggested by peculiarities in the behaviour of the three birds mentioned in Table 15, as well as of other birds while showing minority preferences. Already when observing these birds in the field we obtained the im- pression that birds which made minority choices consistently for some period of time (usually not more than a few hours) showed overt signs of fear (alarm posture, alarm calls) and a tendency to leave the nest. GB6 9 could only be used during one day, at the end of which it became very reluctant in returning to the nest; on the next day it was found to have lost its clutch. It can be seen from Table 15 that of the series of 38 tests, among which the minority choices of these three gulls occurred, the mean time needed to return to the nest (to) and to retrieve the first dummy (ti) were both longer than the average for all 1690 tests dealt with in this chapter. The percentages of tests during which (after initial settling) re-settling, preen- ing or 'any interruptive activity' occurred, were considerably higher than the corresponding percentages for the entire material; only those for building were the same. As explained in Part I the longer latencies and the higher incidence of interruptive behaviour might indicate that a tendency to escape was involved in the causation of minority choices.

When the entire material is con- sidered a difference in to-distribution is still apparent, but it is smaller, due to the fact that in the minus-category the difference is absent. The data permit the conclusion that the probability of a consistent minority choice increases with the length of the to-period. The same probably holds for the tl-values as well. As shown in Table 17 (columns 3 and 4), the average tl-value for all tests (ST + AS) of the ( +, 0, -), the ( + ) and the (-) categories tended to be higher for tests in which the smaller than in which the larger dummy was preferred.

Moreover, in dealing with the ti-period one should separately treat cases in which the bird began to roll before it settled on the clutch (further indicated as ST) and cases in which the bird had already settled before it started to retrieve the first model (AS). This is desirable because the frequency distribution of the tl-values is essentially different for the ST- and the AS-situation, short tl-values being relatively rare in the latter situation (see 11.6, Fig. 24). As shown in Table 17 (columns 6 and 7) the mean tl-values are con- siderably higher for AS than for ST, for all tests taken together as well as separately for the plus- and minus categories (see also Table 18). After splitting up the data the tendency for the average ti-value of the s-choices to exceed that of the b-choices remains for the AS-situation in all categories, though still without reaching a satisfactory level of confidence. For the ST-tests the difference clearly disappears and even tends to be reversed (Table 17, columns 3 and 4). In spite of their statistical deficiencies these data suggested to us that knowledge about the difference in motivational state between the ST and AS situation might help to understand the causation of the first choices for the smaller dummy. As AS involved the brooding posture one would expect it to occur when the incubation system is rather highly activated and its overt expression is not considerably inhibited by other factors. In contrast one would expect a low activation of the incubation system and/or strong inhibition to lead to ST. Testing this hypothesis on the data in Table 16 (column 5, 6, 7) shows that the average to-period was slightly larger for ST than for AS; this difference occurs in the plus and in the minus-category, but only for the entire material can it be considered</page><page sequence="74">TABLE 17.

In addition Fig. 12a shows that the percentage of AS-tests in- creases with increasing length of tl, but decreases with increase of to. The difference between the percentage ST- and AS-tests with to-values below and above to = 4 is significant (Table 18). We, therefore, conclude that relatively short to-periods are more likely to go together with retrieving after settling (AS). We consider activation of the incubation system as the common cause of the occurrence of AS and of short to-latency periods. Short to-values we would expect to be either associated with a relatively high activity state of the incubation system, or with absence of relatively strong inhibitive factors (such as an activated tendency to flee) or with both in combination.

The level of the escape system is likely to increase after ar- rival on the nest, through the close confrontation with the dummies on the nest-rim. A higher average t1-value for the s-choices in AS would therefore mean that the bird is rather highly frightened, but without its incubation tendency being sufficiently inhibited to prevent settling to oc- cur. In absence of fright, even when the tendency to incubate is high, the sitting time would be reduced to zero and consequently the tests would be scored as ST. The possibility of this situation to occur is likely to increase in the course of the season when the equilibrium between the tendencies to incubate and to flee shifts in favour of the former (Part I, p. 209) and in the course of long series of tests with one bird, depending on whether the effect of habituation to the experimental manipulation is stronger than the possible decrease of the tendency to incubate during a parental shift. For all tests dealt with in this chapter Fig. 12b gives the percentage of tests with AS for 5 consecutive 10-day periods in the course of the incuba- tion season.

Fig. 12c shows the percentual distribution of AS-tests over the rank order the tests had in uninterrupted series. Relatively more AS- than ST-tests were found in the first five tests of a series than in later ones (X2 = 18.2, p O0.001). This phenomenon was found to hold for males and females separately and could be verified on data collected in later years. However, cases of ST are also likely to be caused by a low tendency to incubate and/or a relatively high tendency to escape. High activation of fright, especially when combined with a very low tendency to incubate, is likely to prevent the return of the bird during the test period. The bird 63</page><page sequence="77">64 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT will only return when the tendency to flee, during its decline since the start of the test, has reached a level low enough for the bird not to keep it away from the nest any longer. While standing on the nest the escape tendency must be expected to continue its decline, possibly after a tem- porary rise caused by the close view of the dummies. Consequently birds retrieving from the ST-position after a short ti-latency are likely to be more frightened than those retrieving a little later. As mentioned above first choices from the ST-position for the smaller model appeared to have a lower mean t1-value than those for the bigger one (non-significant; see Table 17). On the reasoning followed above this phenomenon was to be expected. Thus, with exception of the extremely short t1-values, in the ST-situation longer tl-values tend to be correlated with first retrievals of the bigger, shorter tl-values with first retrievals of the smaller dummy of the pair. For the entire material, but separately for the ST-and the AS- categories, the quantitative relation between to and t1 was investigated. In the ST-category a negative correlation was found (r = 0.088, p&lt;0.05, n= 823), but in the AS-category no correlation existed (r= 0.004, n = 696). This indicates that in ST-tests to and ti are determined by the same factor or complex of factors, and confirms the idea that in the AS- category the length of to is mainly dominated by one factor, probably the tendency to incubate, whereas another factor, probably the tendency to flee, determinates how long sitting (tlAS) will last. The arguments for the way in which latency, in combination with AS and ST, can be used for assessing the motivational state of a bird when making a choice, will be further discussed and tested in 11.6, in connec- tion with the results of the experiments on the effect of shape, colour and speckling of the egg. In that chapter we shall also consider whether the conclusion following from the above, that consistent choices for the smaller dummy are promoted by longer latencies, can be extended or generalized to minority choices with respect to other classes of egg features. Interruptive behaviour. To assess the validity of using the incidence of interruptive behaviour as a clue to the motivational state it will be necessary to review the causation of different kinds of interruptive behaviour dealt with in II.A.2. of Part I of this monograph. Reasons have been given for assembling the elemen- tary activities distinguished among interruptive behaviour in three main groups: re-settling, building and preening, and also for using in the</page><page sequence="78">SIZE 65 quantitative treatment of the data not the strongly fluctuating numbers of these activities but merely their presence or absence in a test. On the basis of the model developed in Part I, IIC, Fig. 61 it was argued that dif- ferences exist in the factors controlling the occurrence as interruptive behaviour of elements of each of these groups. The complex of factors leading to preening was found to diverge noticeably from that leading to re-settling and building. Between these latter two complexes the dif- ferences were much smaller. The data used in these considerations was mainly obtained from interruptive behaviour induced by a discrepancy from optimal clutch size. The same grouping was also found to hold when the temperature of the eggs in the nest deviated from the optimum (Part I, II.B.2). Consequently the model developed for explaining the causation of the three types of interruptive behaviour had to fit in various different circumstances. In the tests of the experiments now under discussion, besides discrepancies from the optimum number of eggs in the nest, discrepan- cies of egg-shape and egg-size, thus of tactile feedback stimulation from the clutch are also involved. Therefore, we need to investigate whether the same grouping of elementary activities and, in particular, the same kind of interrelations between the three groups, may also be assumed to hold for the conditions of the size and proportion tests. The grouping ap- peared not to be different from that in the observations dealt with in Part I. Also in the present material the elements composing the nestbuilding group (pecking at, picking up and sideways building) occurred in tem- poral correlation. The frequency of various elements of preening (Part I, p. 276-280) showed intercorrelations and so did the sub-activities of settling. With respect to the interactions we should first ask whether it is per- missible to deal in the analysis with the whole test period as an entity. In the present type of experiments three periods (ti, t2, t3) have been distinguished in which interruptive behaviour on the nest can take place, differing with regard to factors in the external situation which are poten- tially able to induce interruptive acts, such as the presence of eggs on the nest-rim and the number of eggs in the nest-bowl. Moreover, depending on the tendency to return of the bird, some tests started with one egg in the nest-bowl (In), whereas in others we had taken the third egg away (On) (see 11.1.2.). Consequently, during ti there were always two dum- mies on the nest-rim and either one or none in the nest-bowl, in t2 there was one on the rim and either two or one in the nest, and in t3 none on the rim and three or two in the nest (see Fig. 6). As demonstrated in Part</page><page sequence="79">66 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT I (compare exps. b and b' in Table 23 of that work), eggs on the rim as well as a shortage of eggs in the bowl may evoke interruptive behaviour, when for some reason retrieving does not take place. A shortage of eggs in the nest also promotes these four types of activity, but when the exter- nal situation is appropriate, retrieving is more readily released than re- settling, building and preening and these interruptive activities are likely to be suppressed as long as retrieval attempts are about to occur. There- fore, the behaviour performed must be determined by an intricate inter- action of antagonistic tendencies, the result of which - for lack of know- ledge of the exact values of the relevant parameters at every moment of the tests - is difficult to predict. In general, in t1 and t2 the occurrence of interruptive behaviour will be promoted by the deficiency of the nest content, but inhibited by the eggs on the rim stimulating the tendency to retrieve. In t3 the interruptive behaviour will only depend on the motiva- tion of the bird and feedback from the nest-bowl. This seems to make it theoretically desirable to deal with the possible relations between the kind of first choice made and the occurrence of interruptive behaviour for each t-period separately. Table 19 gives a survey of the occurrence of interruptive behaviour in the tests of the size and proportion series for re-settling, building and preening. It gives the number of tests in which these behaviours occur- red, differentiated for all ten categories which can theoretically be ex- pected for the distribution of interruptive behaviour over the three t-periods, in cases where two dummies were retrieved as well as where only one was rolled in. When comparing the figures in this table one has to realize that the time available for interruptive behaviour is not equal for the three t-periods; the averages for the length of the periods have been given in the table for ti, t2 and t3, for tests in which 1 and in which 2 eggs were retrieved. Table 19 shows that the occurrence of interruptive behaviour fell main- ly in the last period of the tests, i.e. in t3 when two eggs, and in t2 when one egg was retrieved. This corresponds with the greater length of these periods. The incidence of interruptive behaviour in ti, and in t2 when two dummies were retrieved, was - in correspondence with the smaller average length of these periods - much lower, actually too low to make a separate treatment of these periods statistically promising. However, available time was not the only factor involved in determining the amount of interruptive behaviour. This, for instance, is shown by the relatively low incidence of re-settling and building in t2 when only one dummy was retrieved. We think that this must have been caused by the</page><page sequence="80">SIZE TABLE 19. Incidence of interruptive behaviour in terms of numbers of tests with re-settling, building and preening, among each of the 10 types of tests possible, with regard to the t-period(s) in which interruptive behaviour may occur.

Thus the occurrence of interruptive behaviour during a test is deter- mined by a number of different variables of which it seems unlikely that they can be isolated in the present material by dealing with the different t-periods (or test-types of Table 19) separately, not in the least because the tests are unequally distributed over the ten types distinguished. This is why in the following, with regard to the presence or absence of inter- ruptive behaviour the entire period of the test spent on the nest will be considered as a whole. Table 20 summarizes the data on the co-incidence of the three princi- pal groups of interruptive behaviour and of the advertising display, the 67</page><page sequence="81">68 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT TABLE 20.

Just like the data presented in Part I these data also reveal that preening tended to occur more rarely than expected on the basis of a random distribution in tests in which building and/or re- settling were also present. In contrast the tendency of building to occur in tests with re-settling was higher than expected with random distribution. Consequently we conclude that the model developed in Part I to explain the occurrence of the different interruptive activities is also valid for the experiments on size and shape. While watching the behaviour of the gulls during the tests, we often got the impressing that the oblique-cum-long call might be suitable as an indication of a particular motivational balance of the gull. This is supported by these quantitative data; the oc- currence of the oblique was above expectation when building and preen- ing but not when re-settling occurred. This suggest that the oblique is in- dicative for a conflict between incubating and leaving the nest when the tendency to stay in the territory is strong. Unfortunately the oblique- cum-long call was insufficiently common during the tests to use it as a motivational indicator in practice. Returning now to the investigation of a possible relation between the outcome of a size- (or size/proportion) test and the occurrence of inter- ruptive behaviour shown during that test, it is an obvious step to compare</page><page sequence="82">SIZE 69 populations of tests differentiated on the type of interruptive behaviour that occurred. This is done in Tables 21 and 22, for all size tests taken together and separately for pairs of equally and of unequally shaped models and for plus- and minus-tests. Because of the low number of tests with preening as the exclusive interruptive behaviour, such tests have been pooled with tests in which both preening and building were per- formed. The tables give the total number of tests in each class or sub-class differentiated, and for each of these the percentage of tests in which the smaller dummy of the pair presented was taken first (% s-choices). The statistical signifiance of the differences found between classes was check- ed with the X2-test. The incidence of s-choices is for 9 different classes of tests compared between populations of tests with and without re-settling (Table 21) and in 11 classes between populations of tests with and without building and/or preening (Table 22). In 19 of these 20 classes the % s-choices v'-ere greater in populations of tests with than without interruptive behaviou . The differences were not always statistically reliable however. This reliability was clearly lower for classes in which dummies of equal shape had been presented than in case of unequal shape, probably because ab- normally shaped dummies tend to induce interruptive behaviour more often when the bird tries to incubate them in the nest-bowl. The statistical reliability also tends to be lower for re-settling than for building and/or preening, probably because re-settling (sometimes inclusive of shifting) is more likely than building or preening to occur at least once in the course of a test. If we accept that the occurrence of interruptive behaviour in a test is due to a conflict between tendencies to incubate and to leave, the data presented indicates that s-choices tend to be related to such conflicts. This interpretation emerges more strongly from a comparison between populations of tests with building only (B) and tests in which preening (P; P + B) occurred. In 8 of the 11 classes for which this comparison is made (Table 22) the % s-choices differs in a highly significant manner for tests with preening compared with those with building. Only for the minus- category are these differences not significant, undoubtedly because in this category the s-choices will have been determined predominantly by posi- tion preference. Table 22a allows us in addition to compare the incidence of building and preening with re-settling. It shows that, compared with building, re-settling also tended to be increased when the smaller dummy was retrieved first, though to a much lower extent than preening.</page><page sequence="83">TABLE 21.

On the other hand building was found to indicate a tendency to stay on the nest. The occurrence of re-settling was strongly correlated with that of building and only slightly with preening. Thus, mostly re-settling occurs when the bird is determined to stay but in some cases it seems to be due to a temporary intention to leave the nest, which is quickly overcome. The slightly in- creased incidence of re-settling in case of first choices for the smaller dummy and the considerable rise of preening could therefore be taken as indications of an influence of a relatively high tendency to escape during such tests. This higher incidence of preening in tests with a preference for the smaller sized dummy becomes in particular evident when comparing the values of the quotient Building (B/P) for first choices for bigger and Preening for smaller dummies (Table 22b).</page><page sequence="87">74 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT However, before accepting the B/P-quotient as an indicator for the motivational balance of the gull at the moment it made its decision, a possible objection to its suitability for this purpose has to be considered. The B/P-quotient is based on the occurrence of building and preening on an all or none basis any time during the 20-min. period of the test. We know from Part I, C that the occurrence of interruptive behaviour can be induced by a deviation of the feedback expected and actually received from the clutch. The degree of feedback deficiency varies among tests in dependence of the type of dummies used, the number and character of which of them is first retrieved, and the nest contents (On or In) at the beginning of the test. The B/P-quotient is therefore only applicable for our purpose if the unavoidable variation in the contents of the nest-bowl has mainly interfered with the incidence of interruptive behaviour but not or to only a negligible extent with its composition. We thus have to make sure that the value of the quotient was not primarily effected by the character of the first choice, for instance because first retrieval of an undersized dummy would consistently cause a rise of the tendency to leave the nest and thus lead to an increase of preening. An assessment of the influence of a deficient feedback stimulation on the incidence of preening after a bird has retrieved can be obtained from comparison of the incidence of re-settling, building and preening, and of the B/P-quotients, between populations of tests in which one (Ir) and in which two dummies (2r) were retrieved, starting either with an empty nest-bowl (On) or with one egg in the nest (In). Table 23 provides the necessary data for these comparisons; the result and the statistical reliability of the differences found are given in Table 23a. The tables show that building tends to occur more frequently with 2r than with Ir (comparisons 1, 3, 5, 6 in Table 23a) and with In than with On (comparisons 2, 4). Thus a high tendency to retrieve appears more important for the occurrence of building than a deficiency of the number of eggs in the clutch. In contrast, the data for preening reveal a relation- ship with Ir (comparisons 1, 3, 4, 6), thus with a low tendency to retrieve. The fact that this holds for tests with On as well as In indicates that the feedback effect from the clutch is of less importance for the in- cidence of preening than the motivational balance during the test. Furthermore, Table 23a suggests that re-settling is promoted by a relatively high tendency to retrieve as indicated by 2r (comparisons 1, 4, 5, 6), and also by an empty nest-bowl (comparisons 2, 5). In comparison 3 the effects of two dummies on the nest-rim and an emtpy nest-bowl seem to keep each other in balance. If starting with an empty nest-bowl</page><page sequence="88">TABLE 23.

Table 24 shows that in all cases rather the reverse tends to be true, although only for the entire material this difference can be considered statistically reliable. A likely cause for the higher incidence of s-choices in In-tests is the higher frequency of position preference in this group (see 11.6.7.). The differentiated relationship of building and preening with the tendency to retrieve also appears from the following. In the lower part of Table 22 the percentage of s-choices is given in relation to the occurrence of building and preening differentiated for all tests in which one and all tests in which two eggs were retrieved. In both categories this percentage is significantly higher for tests with preening than for tests with building only, but this difference is greater in the Ir-group since for preening the highest % s-choices is reached there. The Ir-group also shows a significantly higher % s-choices for the population of tests with building and/or preening (B, P, B + P) than for the population of tests without. Such a difference does not appear in the 2r-group, probably because of the much stronger influence of position preference on the incidence of s-choices in that group (see 11.6.7.). The B/P-quotients for the Ir- and 2r-groups are given in Table 22b. As expected from the above paragraph the quotients for b-choices exceed those for s-choices in each of the two groups, but in the 2r-group both quotients reach relatively higher values than in the Ir-group. The latter must be due to the higher tendency to incubate in the 2r-group, pro- moting the incidence of retrieving and building. Although we considered it desirable to check the possibility that the relatively low values of B/P for populations of tests with s-choices might be caused by a deficient feedback from undersized dummies it did not seem likely to us that feedback deviations resulting from such dummies in s-tests would be more disturbing and thus give rise to more interruptive behaviour than those resulting from oversized ones in b-tests. We have tried to verify this by comparing data from experiments in which both dummies were of normal shape, one of them of normal or moderately in- creased size and the other smaller than normal. We have compared how often in these tests interruptive behaviour was present or absent during t2, when either the larger or when the smaller dummy had been retrieved first. Long t2-periods of tests in which one dummy was retrieved and, usually shorter, t2-periods after which a second egg was rolled in, were taken together (Table 24). No significant difference was found in the in-</page><page sequence="90">SIZE 77 cidence of interruptive behaviour in birds sitting on the bigger or on the smaller sized dummy. Table 22c, derived from the data in Table 22, shows that the percen- tage of tests with building and/or preening was higher when dummies of equal than of unequal shape had been offered. This is true for the plus- and the minus-categories and for all categories taken together; the dif- ferences are highly significant. In contrast the percentage of tests with preening tend to be slightly higher with unequal dummies, but this dif- ference is not significant. The latter is in accordance with our findings above that the ratio between building and preening in the tests is not strongly affected by feedback stimulation. The former result, however, we found surprising. The tests with unequally shaped dummies always involved aberrant shape, which one would at first sight expect to act as an external factor additional to aberrant size in causing feedback discrepan- TABLE 24.

A possible explanation seemed that, because the bird might be constantly trying to re-adjust its position on the abnormally shaped eggs, building and preening were sup- pressed through time competition with the more easily released re- settling and shifting. However, Table 22c shows that the same difference, again highly statistically significant, holds for re-settling (inclusive shifting). This leads to the question whether perhaps, contrary to our first expectation, an abnormally shaped egg-dummy may frequently be more satisfactory to sit on than a normally shaped over- or undersized one. One then realizes that the normally shaped dummy is deviant in all its dimensions and therefore will remain always above or below the normal level of the eggs in the nest. In contrast, through shifting in the nest-bowl many of the abnormally shaped dummies can be positioned in such a way that the upper side does not deviate so much from this normal level. To assess the likelihood of this possible explanation for the somewhat lower percentage of tests with interruptive behaviour when unequally</page><page sequence="91">78 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT shaped dummies had been presented, we have compared the percentages of tests with re-settling between two pairs of equally but abnormally shaped dummies of different size: 8W12L versus 6W8L and 12W8L ver- sus 8W6L. Tie differences in volume between the bigger dummies and between the si caller dummies of these pairs is small: however 12W8L can never be positioned in a way that the upper level does not surpass the normal width of an egg (8W). Table 25 shows that re-settling indeed oc- curred in a higher percentage of tests with 12W8L than with 8W12L, but in view of the low statistical reliability this difference cannot be con- sidered as more then merely indicative.

The causation of position preference. In all gulls used in these experiments the phenomenon of position preference was found to occur. The preference seemed to involve definite sites on the nest rim rather than left or right position with respect to the body of the gull. The preference for a particular position on the nest rim could be overcome through increasing the size of the dummy on the non- preferred site. This fact revealed the quantitative character of position preference. As stated in II.1. position preference can be reinforced by placing a relatively effective dummy in successive tests on the same site of the nest rim; it can be counteracted by placing such a dummy on the non- preferred site. This agrees with our experience that position preference is variable in strength in an individual bird. With the same bird it was found to fluctuate in the course of a series of tests within periods of a cou- ple of hours and it could also differ between days. We felt that position preference more often influenced the results of our tests in the beginning and the very end of the season. However, we have no hard data in sup- port of this impression since we did not take 'fair' samples but, on the contrary, abandoned birds which had strong position preference and, by applying various tricks (II.1.), attempted to reduce the position</page><page sequence="92">SIZE 79 preference in birds displaying it to a moderate extent. We had the im- pression that the average tendency for position preference in tests varied between individual birds; in several pairs we found one of the mates, because of strong position preference, unsuitable for testing every time we tried it during its incubation period. In dealing with our data we have sharply distinguished between plus- and minus-tests. This was feasible on the criterion whether position preference alone could be held responsible for the results of, usually paired, tests. This possibility, however, does not necessarily imply that position preference would not also play a part in tests in which dummy preference dominated. Our data show in a number of cases that this was in fact the case. For instance, in Table 22b the relation found between the B/P-quotient and the first choice, either for b or for s, appears in essen- tially the same sense in the plus and in the minus classes, though less pro- nounced in the latter than in the former. In the entire material B/P is for the b-choices lower for the minus than for the plus category (2.2 vs 3.0; X2= 1.39, n.s.); for the s-choices B/P is higher for minus than for plus (1.4 vs 0.7; X2 = 5.08, p&lt;0.01). Since B/P has been used as an index for the motivational balance of the bird these data suggest that changes in the strength of position preference, and thus in its dominance over dummy preference, might be caused by shifts in motivation. Support for the concept that plus and minus are intergrading categories is also found in some latency data, another of the criteria used for assessing motivation. Table 26 shows that the average to-latency for all minus tests (in this category the to-values for b-choices and for s-choices do not differ; see Table 16) takes a statistically reliable in- termediate position between the'relatively low to-latency for consistent b-choices and the relatively high to-values for s-choices in the plus class. Table 27 shows correspondingly that both for the plus- and the minus categories, relationships exist between to and the percentage first choices for the bigger dummy, however for plus and for minus in an inverse sense. The data for B/P and to fit the hypothesis that the motivational balance facilitating position preference is intermediate to the balance promoting consistent first choices for the bigger dummy (majority choices) and that which favours consistent choices for the smaller one (minority choices). In 4.a. of this chapter it was recognized that the motivation during con- sistent minority choices was characterized by a relatively high level of fright. Consequently it seems logical to deduce that position preference occurs when the level of fright is lower and a consistent majority</page><page sequence="93">80 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT TABLE 26.

In fact, preening was reported in 58% of the tests with consistent minority choices, in 38% of all tests dominated by position preference and in 25% of the tests with consistent majority choices. These differences are significant (X2 = 9. 19 and 8.90, respectively) and in agreement with the expectation. The distribution of t1-values, however does not seem to fit this hypothesis. Data representing this distribution are given in Table 26. The ti-average for ST and AS tests of the minus category taken together is not significantly different from those for the b- and for the s-tests in the plus category (which also do not differ significantly one from the other). The necessity to split the ti-data into a population for ST- and for AS- tests means that more data are required for the analysis of the</page><page sequence="94">SIZE 81 t -distribution. The data available from the size and proportion ex- periments are evidently insufficient to unravel the proceedings during t1. We shall come back to this problem in 11.6.7, when the data collected on the other egg features can be incorporated. c. The supernormality phenomenon. On the average each gull was found to prefer dummies of sizes exceeding those of the real egg over normally sized standard models. This does not mean that supersized wooden dummies were also superior in effec- tiveness to real eggs. When dummy 12 was presented in competition with a real egg, both were about equally often retrieved first. A normally sized dummy presented against a real egg was, however, in less than 10% of the plus-tests first rolled in. Always the gulls showed great interest in the supersized dummies, and even if the smaller dummy was retrieved first this usually happened after at least some attempts had been made to retrieve the bigger one. Sometimes, especially with very big dummies, the gulls after some failures to move a dummy climbed upon it and tried to sit on top of it in its position on the nest rim. When a supersized model had been rolled in- to the nest-bowl the gull tirelessly tried to settle on it and bring the brood patches in contact. The effectiveness of supersized models also appeared from the fact that, when a bird had temporarily abandoned its nest after a long series of tests, placing such a model in the nest could often induce it to return. However, large dummies activated more than simply the tendency to incubate. More often than standard dummies they induced overt indica- tions of a tendency to escape. Firstly, a gull which does not have ex- perience with these experiments is much more likely to abandon its nest if testing is started with oversized than with standard dummies. Secondly, in birds approaching a big dummy the anxiety posture with the long slender neck is often seen, alarm calls may be uttered and the to-latency tends to be long. Characteristic for this anxiety situation is further a nib- bling with the bill point at the ends of the dummy, instead of reaching over the centre of the object to start the retrieving response. Thirdly, the very big eggs frequently induced collecting trips; in part I, p. 281 we have argued that the occurrence of such trips during the incubation period can be interpreted as due to strong conflicts between the tendencies to in- cubate and to leave the nest. Above (4.a) we have given the arguments for our opinion that this latter tendency can become responsible for con- sistent first choices for the smaller dummy.</page><page sequence="95">82 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT ( May28,1960-JK2c3 preference for 10; mean to+t1=170sec ;B = 4 103 104 105 106 107 18 10 9 109 10 ( May 24,1952-BB8 ; preference for8;meanto+t1=282sec ' = 7 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 ( June 4,1952-NZ ; preference for6;meanto+tl=438sec ;B =2 P 5 1l~ ~2 3 4 5 6 Fig. 13. Three series of tests each demonstrating a different optimum size for the effec- tiveness of a dummy in inducing the retrieval response. A_</page><page sequence="96">SIZE 83 It was obvious that the escape component increased with the size of the dummy. This can be the explanation for the phenomenon found in some series of tests where the increased effectiveness of a supersized dummy was evident only up to a certain size. Dummies exceeding that size were found to decrease in effectiveness, thus in such cases a preference- optimum for size was found. Three examples with different values for the optimum are given in Fig. 13a, b and c; the optima laying around size 6, size 8 and size 10, respectively. For each series the B/P-quotients and the mean (t( + tl)-values are given; B/P decreases with a decrease of the op- timum. This is to be expected if the hypothesis is correct that an escape tendency counteracts the preference for large size. We assume that this interaction will lead in any gull at any time to an optimum size for effec- tively releasing and/or directing the retrieval response. However, in our series this optimum was seldom surpassed since we rarely used dummies above size 12. Moreover, series with one gull, long enough for demonstrating the existence of an optimum and the position of its peak, were relatively rare. If the interaction between the opposing tendencies is indeed responsi- ble for the occurrence of a preference optimum for size we must also ex- pect this interaction to bring about a deviation from linearity of the rela- tionship between the percentage first choices for the bigger dummy and the maximum projection ratio between the dummies presented, especial- ly in the range of the larger size. In V.6 we shall return to the causal and evolutionary aspects of super- normality after the phenomenon will also have been demonstrated for other features of the egg. d. The interaction of different egg features. The data of tests in which dummies of different sizes and/or propor- tions were presented in various combinations give the impression that differences in size strongly tended to overrule differences in shape. The effect of differences in shape was scarcely demonstrable except in pairs of differently shaped dummies of equal size. This suggests that different characters of the egg may differ in effectiveness with respect to their in- fluence on the retrieval response. However, in considerations of this kind we should keep in mind that the definitions of and distinctions between characters were made by us and not by the gulls, and that shape and size differences are not directly comparable! This problem how stimuli emanating from different features of an ob- ject and possibly of different effectiveness would act together when receiv-</page><page sequence="97">84 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; DRENT ed by a responding animal was in ethology first raised by SEITZ (1940). In a number of different cases data have since been collected which point to an information processing mechanism by which first the effect of each stimulus is determined on the basis of its qualitative and quantitative pro- perties and secondly these separate effects are summated (or in some way mathematically combined) independently of one another in an output, controlling the type and strength of the response. In this concept different combinations of stimuli could lead to an output of the same value and with the same effect. This procedure was called the rule of heterogeneous q lmmation. In this chapter we have encountered the phenomenon of combined ac- tion of different characters in the experiments with mixed presentations of dummies of different size and shape. The combined effect of size and shape is expressed in the differences between the regression lines in Fig. 9. Simultaneous stimulation of different motivational systems by a par- ticular external situation, such as we hold responsible for the preference optimum, should in our opinion also be considered in the context of the heterogeneous summation concept. Since the external situations act on an already existing motivational level the problems of how external and internal stimulation is integrated equally deserve attention. The 'egg recognition' experiments are in principle suitable for verify- ing this 'rule of heterogeneous summation'. The data presented, however, are yet insufficient for this purpose. Data on more characters are necessary and we need one framework to which data on different features can all be referred, a common measuring stick. We shall get to this in the course of later chapters and therefore postpone further discus- sion of the topic of heterogeneous summation until Section V. 5. Conclusion The data and considerations given in this chapter in our opinion lead to the following conclusions: For the incubating bird the size of an egg is effective with respect to releasing and/or directing the retrieval response. Generally, increase of the size of an egg-dummy placed on the nest rim increases its effec- tiveness for this response (majority choices). However, a dummy placed on the nest rim implies in addition some degree of disturbance to the nest. The strength of this disturbing in- fluence also increases with dummy size. The response of the gull is</page><page sequence="98">SIZE 85 therefore the resultant of two antagonistic influences based on the tendencies to retrieve (incubate) and to leave the nest. This causes the relation between size and effectiveness for retrieval to show an optimum, the exact value of which shifts in dependence of the motivational balance of the bird when confronted with the test situation. A strong tendency to escape may lower the effectiveness of the bigger dummy of a pair to a level below that of the smaller one, so that a consis- tent minority choice (= s-choice) results. A moderate influence of the escape tendency may only bring the effectiveness of the bigger dummy so near to that of the smaller one that the difference in value between the dummies is no longer sufficient for surpassing the differences that nearly always occur in the value of the sites on the nest-rim, with as a result that the bird chooses in accordance with a preference for position. Changes in the length-width proportions, causing a deviation of the shape of the dummy from that of the natural egg, reduce its effectiveness for retrieving, but this effect can be easily compensated by a small in- crease in size of the abnormally proportioned dummy. An assessment of the motivational balance of the bird during the choice can be obtained by means of the lengths of the latency-periods to and tl, the position of the bird on the nest just before retrieving the first dummy (standing = ST or sitting = AS) and - when interruptive behaviour oc- curs - the ratio between building and preening (B/P). These methods for rating the motivational balance during the test as well as the effect this balance is thought to have on the decision which dummy to retrieve first, will in the following chapters be tested on in- dependent data collected in experiments on the effectiveness of shape, colour and speckling.</page><page sequence="99">CHAPTER 3 SHAPE by A. G. VAN DER MOLEN and 0. C. DE VOS 1. Introduction A part of the experiments in the preceding chapter, namely those with the 'abnormally proportioned' egg dummies, already provided some infor- mation on the effect of characters of shape in inducing the egg retrieval response. A clear indication was obtained that for dummies with equal maximum projection egg-shape is more effective than any aberrant form, but in the 'size and proportion' series the negative influence of abnormal shape was easily compensated by a slight increase in size. In the present series of experiments we intended to keep the size of the dummies constant and to use shapes differing much more from the natural egg-shape than the elongated and compressed dummies. Like the previous series these experiments on shape were also started with wooden models designed and used in preliminary experiments by N. TINBERGEN (1953). The aberrantly shaped models were in the first place a rect- angular block (B), a cylinder (C), and a 'prism'-shaped block (P) with a longitudinal cross section of a normally sized egg for ground surface. Of all three a version with rounded (R) and one with sharp edges (S) was made. In addition a 'diamond-shaped' dummy with six sharp edges (SD) and egg-like proportions was manufactured, as well as a ball-shaped dummy (B ) which can be conceived of as the two blunt ends of the egg 'melted' together and a lemon-shaped one (Cn), a combination of two pointed ends. Plate VII shows these dummies, Table 28 contains details on their dimensions. The dummies were painted in the standard brownish colour also used in the size-series, with black and grey speckles. Just as in the other series two models were simultaneously presented on the nest rim. The prism-shaped block was always placed on a convex side. As set out in Chapter 1 of this section our choice of the dummies presented in each test depended not so much on a pre-planned pro- gramme as on the results of previous tests during the same sitting spell of the bird involved.</page><page sequence="100">SHAPE 87 TABLE 28.

Already in the beginning of this shape-series it became clear that no shape discrimination was detectable in birds with a position preference which could not be broken by offering dummy 10 in competi- tion with dummy 8 on the preferred site. It then became our practice to select our experimental birds on this criterion before starting shape-tests. The tests in this series were made in May and June of 1955 and 1956. Mr J. BEETSMA and Mr J. J. BEUKEMA kindly assisted in the field work. 2. Results The results of all tests have been summarized in the Tables 29, 30 and 31, which group them, respectively, in three categories: (a) normal versus abnormal shape, (b) rounded versus sharp edged shapes, and (c) block, cylinder and prism against each other. The arrangement of the tables is similar to that in the preceding chapter. Table 29 shows that in general the gulls more often retrieved the egg- shaped dummy (n 8) before than after the aberrant forms presented. This preference comes out clearest when considering the plus-category (col- umn 4) alone or when looking at column 8, which gives for each experi- ment the number of individual birds scoring in favour of either one of the dummies with a margin of at least two tests (as the same experiment was rarely repeated with the same gull more than four times these figures give a fair representation of the individual preferences).

The percentage of tests dominated by position preference (column 5) was somewhat lower when the abnormally shaped dummy was a block than when it had the form of a cylinder or a prism, suggesting that the gulls are able to discriminate between these shapes and - like ourselves - recognize more egg features in the latter two dummies than in the former one. Cylinders and prisms were more often taken in the second place, or totally disregarded, when their edges were sharp than when they were rounded. Remarkably this difference does not show up for blocks. On the contrary, the % n value is lower for sharp edged blocks than for rounded ones, while the % of tests dominated by position preference is about the same for both. This implies that sharp edged blocks must have been con- sistently preferred over egg-shaped dummies relatively more often than rounded blocks. A systematic search of the full records confirmed this conclusion but showed that it was due to particular individuals only. This apparent exception to the rule that rounded edges are preferred will be explained below; it proved very helpful for deepening our insight into the processes involved in the decision-making of the birds in our tests. In competition with egg-shaped dummies both types of blocks scored lower than cylinders and prisms. The latter have a larger extent of round- ed surface than the former. However, the effect of rounded and of sharp edges can better be judged by comparing dummies with these two types of edges directly. The results of the tests relevant to this comparison have been summarized in Table 30. We conclude from these data that rounded blocks and rounded prisms are more effective in inducing retrieving than sharp-edged ones. The difference in effectiveness is more distinct for blocks than for prisms; the number of tests made with the two types of cylinders is unfortunately too low to allow a conclusion. In Table 31 six other experiments have been arranged in a way as to make a paired comparison possible between the effects on the retrieval response of blocks, cylinders and prisms. The results are far from con- clusive. Only in the plus-category for the rounded models a weak indica- tion seems to exist that the effectiveness in inducing retrieval may des- cend in the order: prism - cylinder - block. However, the data make it quite clear that the differences in effectiveness between these three shapes are smaller than between each of these shapes and the egg-shaped model.</page><page sequence="104">TABLE 31.

Only in one case a gull which had proved to be very sensitive for shape differences made a clear 2:0 choice in favour of the lemon- shaped as against the ball-shaped dummy, which as shown in Table 28 had a slightly larger maximum projection. 3. Discussion On the basis of these results the conclusion seems justified that the her- ring gull is sensitive to characters of shape of its egg. Egg-shaped dum- mies are more effective in inducing retrieval than dummies with shapes deviating from those of the egg.

None of the ab- normally shaped dummies we ever tried proved to be more effective than egg-shaped ones. For 'shape' no supernormality phenomenon seems to exist. These rules and the phenomenon of position preference suffice to ac- count for the results of the majority of tests. However, as was already mentioned above, also in the experiments on shape we were from time to time confronted with consistent exceptions to the rules, thus with 'minority choices'. An example is given in Fig. 14. In this series of tests, as well as in other similar cases, sharp-edged dummies proved to be more</page><page sequence="106">SHAPE effective than rounded and even egg-shaped ones. Already in the course of the experiments we had the impression that such minority choices tend to occur in gulls during periods when they were exceedingly sensitive to size differences, particularly in birds distinguishing between the sizes 9 and 8, the lowest maximum projection ratio (1.3) we have ever presented. Attention to size seems to preclude the sensitivity for shape, and the reverse. In 9 different birds it was possible to assess the sensitivity for both types of characters in the same sitting spell. The result, a significant inverse correlation, is shown in Fig. 15. We shall come back to this fin- ding in V.3 and 4.

Relation between the degree of size- and of shape preferencce within one sitting spell. Each point represents the results of a series of consecutive tests with one bird; 5 males and 4 females were used. In the course of the 1955-season we began puzzling why gulls when they showed relatively high sensitivity for size sometimes preferred our sharp edged dummies over rounded ones, in spite of both having the same volume. We realized that volume - for us a convenient measure to keep the size of the dummies in this series constant - was not the most likely parameter to be used by the birds while making their choices. Whereas we were able to apply volumeters or balances the birds could only look at the dummies. Consequently we did the same and found that the sharp edged dummies, when placed on a table next to rounded ones, appeared somewhat larger than the latter. The effect was dependent on 93</page><page sequence="107">94 VAN DER MOLEN &amp; DE VOS the angle of view with regard to the axes of the dummies. As it seemed likely that this effect would be due to differences in the size of the projec- tion of the various dummies on the retina, we verified our impression by measuring the surface of the shadow of the dummy in a beam of parallel light by means of a photocell, holding them under different angles to the direction of the beam. As the values vary with the shape of the dummies as well as with the angle under which they are placed in the beam, we have chosen for comparison the maximum value obtainable in this way for each dummy. As can be seen from the Tables 28, 29, 30 and 31 (column 2) the abnormally shaped dummies all have a maximum projec- tion surface larger than the standard size egg-shaped dummy; the MPs of the sharp edged dummies exceed those of the rounded ones. They roughly match the projection of n 9 of the size series (ca 35 cm2). Only 6 SD has practically the same maximum projection surface as the standard normal egg (28 cm2). Obviously these differences between dummies which should only differ in shape is a fault in the experimental set up. When this became fully clear to us the amount of data collected with these models was too large to be ignored, but still insufficient for use without further tests. We therefore decided to continue with the same set of models, hoping that differences in projection surface between rounded and sharp edged dum- mies would usually fall within the exactitude of our experimental techni- que and/or the size discrimination exerted by the gulls. This hope seemed justified considering that the overall result of all presentations of n 9 versus n 8 is 23-13, indicating that this discrimination is difficult (MPR = 1.3). However, we have now learned that the occasionally occurring consis- tent preferences for the abnormally shaped dummies - in particular the sharp edged ones - over n 8 are likely to be due to a high sensitivity for size differences of the bird, at least during the period of the tests involved. This opens the theoretical possibility that the cases of preference for the egg-shaped dummy were in fact cases of preference for the smaller dum- my of a pair, thus minority choices in the sense of the size series. In that case shape discrimination might not take place at all. In our opinion a number of arguments force us to reject this possibility. (1) In the size and proportion series the incidence of consistent choices for the smaller but egg-shaped dummy (Table 13, column 9 below) amounted to 26%, whereas in the shape series the smaller but egg- shaped dummy was consistently preferred in 83% of all presentations. There is no reason whatever for assuming that the percentage of tests with preference for the smaller projection surface should essentially differ</page><page sequence="108">SHAPE 95 between the two series. In agreement with this, in 16 tests randomly distributed over the period in which the shape experiments were done, in which dummy n 10 (492 mm2) was given in competition with an abnor- mally shaped dummy (328-400 mm2) the former was preferred 14 times. (2) Dummy n 8 (MP 284 mm2) has been preferred over 6RC (MP 281 mm2) in all 14 presentations falling in the plus-category (3-1 in the 0-category).

(4) Several series of tests, of which Fig. 16 gives two examples, display next to a preference for egg-shaped dummies a preference for larger size in equally shaped dummies. The occasional interspersion of a series of shape-tests with a presenta- tion of egg-shaped dummies of different size enables us to make a rough assessment of the relative effect of differences of shape in comparison with size differences, namely in cases where a position preference dominating in the shape-tests is surpassed in a size test (example in Fig. 17).

Altogether we obtained in this way 32 times an assessment of the order of difference in effectiveness for releasing and/or directing the retrieving response between normal standard dummies (n 8) and any of the abnor- mally shaped dummies in this series. In 28 cases the ratio between these two types of dummies was found to be smaller than the ratio nlO/n8 (MPR = 1.7) (for 12 even smaller than the ratio n9/n8, MPR = 1.2), in 4</page><page sequence="110">SHAPE 97 cases it seemed to be greater than 1.7. This suggests that the importance of 'shape' in releasing incubation responses is relatively small, a point which will be further investigated in 11.7. 4. Conclusion The gulls are able to discriminate different shapes. They preferred typically egg-shaped dummies over blocks, cylinders and prisms of the same maximum projection surface. Dummies with rounded edges scored higher than sharp edged ones. With respect to the character 'shape' the phenomenon of supernormality was not found. A difference in maximum projection ratio of 20% could overrule all shape differences tried.</page><page sequence="111">CHAPTER 4 COLOUR by H. J. BAARDA and M. J. MUDDE 1. Introduction and methods The experiments undertaken in this chapter were meant to answer the question whether the overall colour of the object retrieved is one of the features effective in releasing and/or directing the egg-rolling response. Normally sized egg-shaped wooden models were used, painted in dif- ferent ground colours and with an evenly distributed speckling pattern of moderately sized black spots only. In addition to the brown (khaki) col- our in which the size models were painted and which fell within the range of variation among the natural eggs we used a blue colour slightly darker than that of the cyanotic eggs and a red, a yellow and a green colour, markedly different from what we ever found on real eggs in nature (Plate IX). Ideally, experiments on the relative effectiveness of different colours should be done with monochromatic light. Then the effect of wavelength can technically be separated from that of brightness by changing the in- tensity of this light. Moreover the effect of saturation (see colour solid in Fig. 3) can then be studied by mixing the monochromatic light with white light of different intensity. In our test situation, however, we had to work with colours resulting from reflected light from painted objects. One way to control the effect of brightness, thus the amount of light reflected ir- respectively of wavelength and perceived as such by the bird, was to prepare differently coloured paints that appeared about equally bright to us. We felt that this was permissable since the herring gull is known to have a colour sensitivity very similar to that of the human eye (DELIUS &amp; THOMPSON, 1970; THOMPSON, 1971). As this method involved mixing coloured powder with quantities of white, it necessarily implied a decrease of the degree of saturation of the colours. However, the colours of the natural eggs are certainly unsaturated. Another way to control for brightness was, when finding an indication of selectively with regard to colour, to check the coloured dummy against each one of a graded series of grey dummies, differing thus in brightness only. Moreover, by presenting two shades of grey in competition we can</page><page sequence="112">COLOUR 99 determine whether the degree of brightness is likely to play a role in determining the effectiveness of an object for inducing the retrieval response. The greys were made by mixing black powder in different proportions with white. Six shades of grey, intended to be equidistant steps and numbered from I (darkest grey) to VI (white), have been used. Compared with the reflection of a block of magnesium carbonate which served as a reference, their overall percentages of reflection were: I= 22%, II = 32%, III = 41%, IV = 50%, V = 65% and VI = 86%. The colours and the grey tints were finally measured and compared by means of an EEL Reflectance-Spectrophoto- meter. The reflectance curves are given in Fig. 19a and b. For comparison in Fig. 18 the 100 80 o~ 60 0 40 20 400 500 600 700 wavelength, mp Fig. 18. Relative reflectance of different wavelengths by 10 real eggs. curves for 10 real eggs have been given. When making these measurements on the real eggs we tried to include as few speckles as possible in the field measured. However, as this circular field had a diameter of 20 mm not all speckles could be avoided. This detracts from the comparability with the paints used, as here measurements were made before the speckling was applied. The presentation technique was the same as in the experiments on size and shape. Birds with a sufficiently weak position preference were usually selected through first testing them with dummies of the size series. Birds not consistently discriminating between the sizes 8 and 10 were not used in the colour experiments. Most tests in these series were made in 1956 and 1957, additional tests were carried out in 1960. 2. Results The results have been summarized in 6 tables. The Tables 32-36 give, each for another colour, the scores of all presentations of that colour against the other colours and against models of the grey series. The scores</page><page sequence="113">100 BAARDA &amp; MUDDE for presentations of pairs of different grey dummies are given in Table 37. The results of each experiment have been expressed in various ways. For all tests taken together (column 2) and for the plus-category (column 3) separately the full scores have been given as well as the percentage of tests in which the colour under consideration was preferred.

Most of the decisions of the birds concerned were clearly in favour of one type of dummy of the pair (thus either 2-0, 3-0, 4-0 etc. or the reverse); in only 17% of the decisions the non-preferred dummy was also a few times retrieved first (thus either 3-1, 8-2, or 1-5, 2-6 etc.). The sum of column 7 shows how often a bird in an experiment has decided in favour of either the first mentioned dummy or for one of its alternatives. Column 6 shows, in percentages of the number of presentations involved, how often each of the dummies was left on the nest-rim during the entire test. In column 4 for each experi- ment the amount of tests dominated by position preference is given. The number of different birds tested in each experiment is shown in column 8. For two colours the results are very conclusive. Green was clearly preferred over all other colours and over all shades of grey; for red the scores were lowest. In only 14% of the tests of the plus-category in which a green model was presented did a bird take the alternative dummy first (Table 32, column 3); only 8 times a bird showed this preference for the alternative consistently in all tests of an experiment (against 72 times for green, column 1). The green dummy was much more rarely found left on the nest-rim at the conclusion of a test than the alternative (column 6). The alternative to a red dummy (Table 36) was preferred in 69% of the tests of the plus-category (column 3), while 29 times an individual bird consistently took the alternative first in an experiment against 14 times the red model (column 7). If only experiments with two coloured dum- mies are considered these figures are 20 and 14, respectively. The red dummy was also more often not retrieved than the alternative (column 6). These figures seem to suggest that the avoidance of red is not as strong as the preference for green, but the unequal and different distribution of the number of tests over the various experiments of each series is an im- pediment to making such a conclusion reliable. As green was clearly preferred over all shades of grey used, we con- clude that the decisions in favour of green were indeed made on the basis of wavelength. An analogous conclusion with respect to the low value of red is neither rejected nor established by the data of Table 36. The equal scores of red against grey III and grey V might point to brightness as the decisive factor; the inferiority of the red dummy when confronted with dummies of the four other colours, however, rather speaks for wavelength discrimination. New tests would be necessary to solve this problem, but sufficiently long series with red and grey are difficult to ob- tain because both colours are evidently unattractive to the gulls.</page><page sequence="115">TABLE 32.

Yellow scored definitely higher than brown, but for brown against blue and blue against yellow the scores were almost equal. We have the impression that the relative value of the different colours is reasonably well expressed by the percentage choices they scored in total in plus-tests when tested with grey tones: green 86%, yellow 70%, brown 62%, blue 45%, red 44%. The 6 grey shades scored relatively low when presented in competition with yellow and brown, but about equal to blue. The tables show for all combinations except those with green a con- siderable difference in the preference of individual birds (column 7). This need not necessarily be due to individual differences in colour preference; it might also result from the use of another criterion than colour by the bird when two dummies of unattractive colour are simultaneously presented. Subjective brightness might be such a criterion, despite our attempt to make the dummies look about equally bright to our eyes. An attempt to test the relative effectiveness of different degrees of brightness was made by means of combinations of two shades of grey. Unfortunately the number of tests carried out in these 10 experiments varied greatly from one to the other and the total amount of tests does not suffice to reach statistical reliability. This was due to various reasons; one of them being that higher priority had been given to presentations in which colours were involved, another that birds more easily got scared by tests in which grey shades only were used. Nevertheless we think that some interesting information can yet be obtained from these data (Table 37). First, when the scores for the darker and for the lighter dummy of each pair are compared a preference for the lighter becomes apparent. However, this preference does not seem to extend as far as the white dummy (VI). Always when a bird consistently preferred the darker dum- my of a pair, the alternative was the white one (column 7). The 2 cases in which a bird scored higher for the white than for the grey dummy (col- umn 7: IV vs VI and V vs VI) concern the same individual 9 0211 on 2 days separated by a 4 days interval. This individual reached high scores for green and yellow and showed no signs of fright. The data available would fit the hypothesis that for the effectiveness of brightness an op- timum exists which shifts towards darker shades when the tendency to escape rises. However, our material is quantitatively insufficient to test this hypothesis properly.</page><page sequence="121">00 TABLE 37.

Discussion The phenomenon of supernormality earlier found for the character 'size' also proved to be clearly present for the character 'colour'. The green col- our used, which was very unlike the real background and colour of the egg, turned out to be the most effective colour for inducing retrieving responses in all gulls tried. However - just as was found for shape - sometimes a gull for a limited period preferred the more natural brown colour.

In the 3rd test in this series (to = 3) Grey IV was retrieved from site A and Yellow left on the nest-rim (site B) and in the 4th and last test Grey IV was retrieved from site B (to = 10) and Blue left on site e. Preening while on the nest occurred again. In addition to this evidence from separate records we have quan- titatively investigated all data on colour with respect to differences in parameters possibly indicative of motivation between consistent first choices for a supernormally coloured dummy and consistent first choices for the generally less preferred one. The results are presented in Tables 38 and 39. In these tables data are given for green, as the most preferred 'supernormal' colour, against all other colours, but also for green plus yellow against the rest. Although less effective than green, yellow was in general clearly preferred over brown, so yellow can also be considered a supernormal colour. Combining these two colours makes the distribution over the two groups compared in the tables less unequal and hence better amenable for statistical analysis. In the first place the tables show a difference in the latency periods to and t1; both tend to be longer when the 'non-super' dummy was taken first. The statistical significance of these differences has been checked in two ways: for the distribution of the various t-classes by way of the Wilcoxon-test (Table 38) and for t-values below and above 1 min by means of the X2-test (Table 39). The t1-latencies have also been treated separately for ST and AS because of the difference in distribution be-</page><page sequence="124">COLOUR 111 TABLE 38. Result of comparison, by means of the Wilcoxon-test, be- tween the distributions of different latency-time classes for all tests (not dominated by position preference) in which the supernormally coloured dummy (green, or green + yellow taken together) was taken first, and all tests in which this dummy was taken second or disregarded Dummies compared Latency period Wilxoxon test considered To p Green vs not green to 0.95 n.s. t1 2.25 &lt;0.01 ti (ST) 1.32 &lt;0.10 t!

The differences found are all in agreement with the expectation that first choices for the supernormal dummy correlate with shorter and first choices for the alternative dummies with longer latencies. Not all these differences, however, can be considered significant. In the second place, the incidence of two behaviour patterns was in- vestigated, which in the size series have been found to be correlated with minority choices, viz. AS and preening (P). Each of these occurred less often in tests in which the supernormal dummy was preferred; however, for P a satisfactory level of statistical reliability was not reached, probably because of the generally low incidence of this behaviour pattern during the tests. The apparent inconsistency in the scores obtained when yellow, brown and blue were tested against each other, has been mentioned under results. These scores are summarized in Fig. 21; Fig. 19a shows that the three reflection curves differ considerably. The problem to explain is why yellow was clearly superior to brown, but about equally effective as blue, while this colour seems about equivalent to, but certainly not more effec- tive than brown. For finding an answer to this question it may be of im- portance to realise that the even scores in the end-results of the ex- periments 'brown vs blue' and 'yellow vs blue' are to a considerable ex- tent due to particular birds preferring during a series of tests consistently</page><page sequence="125">TABLE 39.

When yellow was given against blue, 5 birds showed in paired tests a consistent preference for the former colour and 5 other birds for the latter. For brown against blue these numbers are 4 birds for each of the dummies. At one nest, o0 and 9 could be tested on the same day with the same dummies (yellow and blue); the o consistently preferred the yellow, but its mate the blue model. In a few cases the same bird could be confronted with the same pair of models at different times during the season; sometimes the preference had remained the same, sometimes it had changed. Table 40 gives such data for one particular bird. Apart from this switch of preference with time, this table also shows that this bird on the 14 and 15June showed as an individual the apparently incon- sistent combination of preferences of yellow over brown, of brown over blue and of blue over yellow. yellow 21-2own blue 17-10 red Fig. 21. Survey of the scores obtained in paired combinations of green, yellow, brown, blue and red (all plus-tests, Tables 32-36). Direction of arrows marks preference trends (closed symbols are considered significant, open symbols indicative). This controversy demands an explanation. Yellow is definitely superior over brown. The only two cases in which brown was consistently preferred concern two successive tests with the same bird. In both tests it took all of 10 min before this bird retrieved the first dummy and, moreover, in the second test it preened while sitting on the nest. We therefore conclude that this minority preference for brown was caused by the interference of a relatively high tendency to escape.</page><page sequence="127">114 BAARDA &amp; MUDDE TABLE 40.

As already mentioned equal numbers of birds tended towards a preference for the brown and for the blue dummy (Table 34). Brown seems slightly superior to the greys. As the greys appeared about equally effective as blue (Table 35) we are inclined to believe that with an increase of the number of tests the difference between brown and blue would probably become significant. For an explanation of the equality of the number of birds scoring for brown and for blue when tested against each other, and in particular of the equal scores for yellow versus blue, we think that it may prove worth-</page><page sequence="128">COLOUR 115 while to investigate the possibility that in case of presentation of unattrac- tive colours, considerably deviating from normal, a bird may at different times not always use the same criteria for making its choice. Also dif- ferent individuals may prefer different possible criteria. Could it be that birds who retrieved the yellow dummy first chose for colour and birds preferring the blue one for brightness? This idea was suggested by the behaviour of 9 7138 (already referred to in Table 40) for which in Table 41 the scores have been summarized and compared with those of its mate, who was tested with the same dum- mies during the same period. The response to green was the same in both birds, irrespective of the colour of the dummy paired with the supernor- mal colour. The response to the yellow models was only the same in both birds when yellow was presented together with brown; the dummy deviated least from the normal egg. However, when the second dummy was blue or red the 9 appears to have turned to another criterion than the O. The latter kept its preference for coloured dummies, unless the dummy was red. The few data available on brightness preference of the two birds suggest that the 9 was more responsive to this feature than the O and preferred the lighter greys - at least up to grey V, grey VI (= white) was unfortunately not tried on her. Arguments have been given above that for brightness preference an optimum exists. Its value varies between individuals and within an individual with time. Scattered observations indicate that this optimum tends to shift from brighter to darker greys when signs of fright become apparent. Thus, if yellow would possess a high subjective brightness (which to our eye seems likely), com- bined presentation of this yellow dummy with one of another non- familiar colour, might cause such a shift and so reduce the probability that the yellow dummy is first chosen. The unfamiliar situation might also be responsible for the switch from colour to brightness as a criterion for decision making, in analogy to the switch from supernormal to resemblance in case of anxiety, mentioned above. However, our data on the yellow and blue choices are insufficient to support this hypothesis quantitatively. To test it properly a collection of new data along lines specially planned for this purpose would be necessary. 4. Conclusion The colour of the egg plays a role in releasing and/or directing retrieval. Green is by far the most effective colour. As the green colour used was very different from the ground colour of the natural egg this effect may be</page><page sequence="129">116 BAARDA &amp; MUDDE called 'supernormal'. The same holds for yellow. The brown tone used, which came nearest to the natural egg colour, appears to be somewhat more effective than blue and the various shades of grey. Red is the least effective colour. Gulls may from time to time show a consistent preference for brown when this colour is paired with a supernormal colour. This temporal preference shift is likely to be due to an increased tendency to escape, conflicting with the incubation tendency. The data indicate that besides colour also brightness plays a role in determining the effectiveness of an object with respect to the retrieval response, but probably a less important one. Lighter objects are in general preferred over darker ones but very high brightness did not pro- mote retrieval. It is not unlikely that in the individual bird the preference for various degrees of brightness follows an optimum course. The posi- tion of the optimum seems to shift with a change of motivation, i.e. towards darker grey tones when the tendency to escape rises. The three alternatives of reactivity to either the generally most effective colour or to an optimum of brightness, or to the degree of resemblance the colour and brightness of a dummy bears to those of the natural egg, might account for consistent differences between the scores of individual birds. In particular such differences occurred when the simultaneously presented dummies both considerably deviated from normal (e.g. yellow and blue). Which alternative is taken in a test might depend on the motivational balance of the bird during the trial.</page><page sequence="130">CHAPTER 5 SPECKLING by J. P. KRUIJT and A. J. HOGAN-WARBURG 1. Introduction This chapter deals with the question whether the speckling pattern is ef- fective in releasing and/or directing the retrieval response and, if so, which characteristics of the speckling pattern are important. In particular with regard to the second question we should keep in mind that our distinction of characteristics is necessarily anthropomorphic, instead of - ideally - 'larimorphic'. In other words, we should be aware that what appears to people as a particular pattern, may be processed quite dif- ferently by the gulls. This implies that we have to consider all possibilities we can conceive of and design dummies by which alternatives can be tested. The main difficulty in this procedure is that it is impossible to manipulate one abstract characteristic without influencing one or more of the others. Nevertheless we are of opinion that through comparison of the results with different dummy pairs some reliable answers can be given. All dummies used in the experiments described in this chapter were egg shaped, of normal size and made of wood. Coloured dummies were always painted in standard brown (see Fig. 19), but in addition white, black and four shades of grey have been used for the background as well as for the speckles. Descriptions of the different dummies will be given when discussing the results of the various experiments. 2. Results a. The stimulus value of speckling as such. A number of different experiments have been carried out to test the stimulus value of the speckling pattern. The results are summarized in Table 42. The most obvious experiment (exp. I) is the presentation of the stan- dard dummy (St; normal size, brown groundcolour, black and grey speckles in average natural number) in competition with an equally sized plain brown model (BrPl) (Plate X). By all measures used the speckled dummy was very convincingly preferred. This preference need not</page><page sequence="131">TABLE 42.

One conceivable possibility would be a preference for black. A pilot ex- periment in which a plain black and a plain grey dummy were offered in competition (exp. V) indeed seemed to indicate that the former was more attractive. Another theoretical possibility was a preference for overall darker instead of brighter eggs. Although this supposition was not sup- ported by the results of the experiments with black-speckled dummies of different shades, described in the foregoing chapter (II.4.1, Table 37), this alternative was further investigated in the following three control ex- periments (exps II-IV). First (exp. II) the plain brown dummy was tested against a brown dummy with white speckling (BrWh). Again the speckled model was clearly preferred over the plain coloured one. The theoretical possibility that this result is due to a high stimulus value of white as such can be re- jected because of the result from a third experiment (III) in which (BrWh) was tested against a plain white dummy (WhPl). The latter was chosen only once, in a clear case of position preference. The number of tests in this series is low because several times the birds stayed away when the plain coloured egg was lying on the nest rim. In spite of this a number of tests could be obtained from an experiment in which two plain col- oured dummies, one white (WhPl) and one brown (BrPI), were tested against each other (exp. IV). No difference in stimulus value between these dummies is revealed by the data obtained. When comparing the results of exps III, IV and V one may wonder why the plain grey dummy was apparently lower rated than the plain black and the plain white one. We suggest that this might have been due to the greater contrast the black and white dummies had against the background of the nest; they were more conspicuous than the grey one. The grey and the brown dummy were about equally bright; the former was the least conspicuous, but the best match to the natural groundcolour of the natural egg. In the preceding chapter grey was always at the bot- tom of the scores. The number of tests with plain dummies was low because such tests are so difficult to perform. In about half of the number of tests with two plain dummies on the nest rim none of them was retriev- ed; for all kinds of presentations taken together no retrieval at all occur- red in less than one fifth of the tests. Summarizing we are of opinion that on the basis of the results of ex- periments I-V it can be concluded that the speckling as such is effective in releasing and/or directing retrieval behaviour. With regard to the typical distribution of the speckles (see I.3.d), their shape, and the presence of</page><page sequence="133">120 KRUIJT &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG both black and grey speckles, only a few pilot experiments have been done. These gave no reason to reject the possibility that such characteristics could be of some value, but they made it likely that, if so, this value would rarely be high enough to surpass the effect of the average values of position preference. Consequently such experiments were not further pursued. b. The influence of number and size of the speckles on the stimulus effect of the pattern. Two introductory experiments were carried out in 1952 and 1953; the results are summarized in Table 42. In exp. VI a dummy (msp) with about twice as many (black and grey) speckles as the standard model was given against a dummy with half that amount (fsp) (Plate X). Dummy msp proved to be more effective. This could be due to the greater number of speckles, but also to the greater amount of black. Consequently a dum- my (flsp) was made on which the amount of black and grey of the speckles of dummy msp was concentrated in a small number (equal to that in dummy fsp) of large speckles. When tested against dummy fsp (exp. VII) the scores for both dummies were almost equal. It appears, therefore, that a quantity of black surface becomes more effective when distributed over more patches. This may also have led to the result of the next experi- ment (exp. VIII) in which a standard brown model was given against its 'negative': a black model with brown patches (BlaBr). In spite of the larger amount of black (in a coherent pattern) the 'negative' pattern was not preferred over the 'positive' one. Thus, the effectiveness of a speckling pattern seems to be higher when the number of speckles is greater, their size smaller and when the speckles are dark on a light background. Experiment VII is not suitable for judging the effect of speckle size because the amount of black differed between the two dummies. Also the number of tests in this experiment was small and the extraordinarily high percentage of position preference indicated that for detecting the dif- ferences in effectiveness that might exist here, larger number of tests and more sophisticated dummies were needed. Consequently in 1953 two new series of experiments to investigate the effects of number and size of the speckles were undertaken. Unfortunately it is impossible to vary the number of speckles, their size and the total amount of black surface independently on different dum- mies. One series of four dummies was made in which the amount of black surface was kept constant while size and number were varied. The</page><page sequence="134">SPECKLING 121 TABLE 43.

These models are shown in Plate X; Table 43 gives some characteristics of the speckling pattern and the code for these dummies. In the second series the number of speckles was the same in the two dummies presented simultaneously (either 16 or 64), but their size was different. The same four size classes were used as in the former series. Table 44 gives a survey of the results of both series. All criteria point to a preference for a greater number of smaller over a smaller number of bigger speckles. but clear results were only obtained when the dif- ferences in speckle-size were relatively large. In our opinion the most like- ly interpretation of the results of these two series is that number and size are both important, a larger number and a smaller size of the spot in- creasing the effectiveness of a dummy for releasing and/or directing the incubation response. For the alternative interpretation of the outcome of the second series, i.e. that greater brightness might be attractive, only weak and even contradictory indications were obtained. Although the results of the first series could also entirely be explained on the basis of the preference for smaller sizes, we are of opinion that, when considering them in combination with the results of exp. VI and VII (arguing, respectively, in favour of number and against quantity of black), the assumption is justified that in addition the number of speckles is effective. c. The effect of the shades of speckles and background. Conceivably the following factors could be effective here: -the overall brightness of the egg, -the shade of the speckles, -the shade of their background on the egg shell, - the contrast between speckles and background, -the darkness of the speckles with respect to the background ('positive' pattern).</page><page sequence="135">TABLE 44.

In the lower part the number is constant whereas size, and thus also total speckle surface, is varied.</page><page sequence="136">SPECKLING 123 In 1952 and 1953 we first tried to assess the relative effectiveness of these different potential factors with a series of models based on the stan- dard brown model. In experiment X (Table 42) comparison between brown dummies with only black (BrBla) and with only grey speckles (BrGy) demonstrated the higher effectiveness of the former dummies which were as a whole darker, contained black and showed a stronger contrast between speckles and background. In experiment IX the difference in contrast between the dummies was reduced by offering BrBla in competition with a brown model with white speckles (BrWh). To the human eye these two dummies did not differ much in contrast, nevertheless the outcome of exp. IX was practically the same as that of exp. X. We tend to conclude that darkness of the speckles, and not their contrast with the background must have decidedly influenced the result of both experiments. A difference in contrast is also involved in another experiment (exp. XI) in which BrBla was paired with a white dummy with black speckles (WhBlc) (Plate X). Although BrBla scored highest, a considerable number of times WhBlc was retrieved first; the difference in preference can hardly be considered significant. It seems important to realize that - compared with most other experiments - there was not much agreement in the preference of different birds (see column 7). WhBla seemed to con- tain features which were apparently attractive for some birds, or at least at certain times, perhaps in particular motivational conditions and not in others. High contrast might be such a feature, white might be another one. The only other experiment showing a striking disagreement in the results of individual birds is exp. VIII, making it likely that the 'negative' pattern of BlaBr also possessed a combination of characters with am- bivalent effectiveness. The results obtained in the experiments VIII-XI emphasize the effect of black speckles, but they do not exclude separate effects of overall brightness and contrast. The conclusions are made difficult because the factor colour is present in the dummies. To carry the analysis further a more extensive series of dummies was prepared in which for the speckles and the backgrounds only different shades of grey have been used. d. The grey tones (Li-Me-Da-Bla) series. Four shades of grey have been used in this series; they are called light (Li) medium (Me), dark (Da) and black (Bla). Non-shining paints were prepared by mixing black and white dye powders in different proportions</page><page sequence="137">124 KRUIJT &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG emulsifying them in oil to a non-shining paint. The reflectance percen- tages, compared with magnesium-carbonate, were Li = 54%, Me= 27%, Da =14%, Bla=7%. Dummies were made in all twelve possible combinations of two shades of grey, one for the speckling and the other for the background. This meant that in 6 dummies darker speckles featured on the lighter ground shade with 3 different degrees of contrast ('positive' speckling patterns) and on the other 6 dummies lighter speckles on a darker background with the same three degrees of contrast ('negative' speckling patterns). Plate XI shows these dummies, Fig. 22 pictures the principle according to which the models were made and, moreover, gives a survey of the preference gradient. To us four different qualities are distinguishable in the speckling of the dummies, viz.: the reflection of the speckles, the reflection of the background, the contrast between speckles and back- ground and the 'sign' of the pattern. Unfortunately it is impossible to present each of these qualities separately in a dummy. Because of in- terdependence at least two of the four qualities will change together. Some insight in the effectiveness of each of the qualities is nevertheless aimed at by comparing the results of presentations of different types of dummy pairs. In principle the 'chess-playing' method, mentioned in 11.1.2 was followed. Consequently not all dummy pairs possible were presented and neither was an attempt made to present all pairs used an equal number of times. A detailed presentation of the results of all experimental series is not feasible; the Tables 45 and 46 have been composed to give a survey of the experiments made and the results obtained. The conclusions which we shall draw from these tables are all in agreement with those resulting from the comparison of the preferences of a gull in successive tests. A first idea of the relative effectiveness of the 12 dummies can be ob- tained by calculating for each of them how often it scored first in all tests of the dummy combinations in which it was presented. The results (as percentages of all presentations of the dummy) are given in Table 45. Although the reliability of this method is reduced by the irregular distribution of the data over the different cells it makes a preliminary rank order of the dummies possible. This rank order can be improved through a comparison of the results of the 23 different experiments made with these dummies. These are given in Table 46, expressed in two different ways, viz.: (a) as the number of trials in which each of the dummies presented was retrieved first (column 4); (b) as the number of birds that in the same experiment</page><page sequence="138">TABLE 45 Survey and results of the experiments made with dummies from the 'Li-Me-Da-Bla' series I when LiBla LiDa LiMe MeBla MeDa MeLi DaBla DaMe DaLi BlaDa BlaLi E Total nr. % E Rank number chosen paired of trials of first with in which total Pre- Final dummy was liminary presented LiBla - 6 30 47 83 138 60 1 1 (5) (19) (30) (54) LiDa - 35 40 34 109 200 55 2 2 (18) (27) (21) (66) LiMe 1 - 45 45 14 68 19 22 10 25 240 535 45 3 4 (0) (14) (21) (3) (41) (4) (19) (6) (12) (120) MeBla 21 17 65 15 118 286 41 5 3 (6) (3) (40) (7) (56) MeDa 23 34 10 67 196 34 7 5 (8) (20) (6) (34) MeLi 9 34 - 12 5 85 145 395 37 6 8 (0) (14) (5) (0) (38) (57) DaBla 18 19 47 7 4 23 - 19 10 147 433 34 8 6 (2) (5) (15) (0) (0) (11) (16) (4) (53) DaMe 10 7 9 - 10 36 177 20 11 9 (5) (2) (4) (3) (14) DaLi 10 101 12 21 - 144 346 42 4 7 (0) (44) (6) (14) (66) BlaDa 22 2 24 80 30 9 11 (1) (0) (1) BlaLi 13 13 44 30 10 10 (13) (3) e40 58 185 117 83 179 213 55 127 44 25 1126 (8) (9) (76) (51) (35) (80) (126) (34) (64) (27) (12) (522) The figures in each cell indicate how often the corresponding dummy in the left column, when presented in competition with the dummy in the top row, was chosen first.

Column 6 gives ratings for the differences between the ground tones of the two dummies in the grey gradations described above, column 7 does the same for the speckles. Column 8 indicates for each model the degree of contrast between speckles and ground shade. Column 9 shows for each dummy of the pair the 'sign' of the pattern. The arrows in the columns 6-9 point for each combination in the direction of: - the lighter background, to be indicated with the symbol (b) - the darker spots, -(s) - the higher contrast, - (c) - the positive pattern, - (p). These are the four characteristics suggested to be of importance in determining preferences in the experiments of the preceding section. We shall now investigate whether the direction of the preferences found in the 23 experiments of the 'Li-Me-Da-Bla' series can be explain- ed on the basis of one or more of these characteristics and how far their relative effectiveness can be assessed. It can be concluded: from the exps. 2, 3, 4 and 8: b&gt;s (I) from exp. 13: b &lt; c (II) from exp. 5: b&lt;s+c (III) from exp. 11: s&lt;c (IV) from exp. 16: c= s + p (V) from exp. 9: b+c&gt;s (VI) from exp. 17: s + p &gt; b (VII) from exps 20 and 23: b + s + p &gt; c (VIII) It follows from I, II and IV that: s&lt;b&lt;c; and in combination with V: s&lt;b&lt;c&lt;p; which rank order also fits the relations III, VI, VII and VIII. This means that the positive pattern is the most effective character. The contrast be- tween speckles and background comes next, followed by the light background. Whether the dark or black spot colour is itself effective, in- dependently of contrast with the ground tone, cannot be deduced from these results. In Fig. 22 the results of all experiments are represented in a diagram in which the twelve dummies have been arranged in accordance with the sign of the pattern, the amount of contrast between speckles and background and the brightness of the latter. The arrows run from the dummy which showed the lower score in the columns 4 and 5 of Table 46 to the preferred one. According to these results the order of effectiveness</page><page sequence="140">SPECKLING 127 of the 7 dummies with positive patterns is: LiBla-LiDa-MeBla-LiMe- MeDa-DaBla. When paired with 'negative' dummies these 'positive' dummies were in 7 of 10 experiments found superior. The results of the remaining experiment - LiMe x DaMe (19), MeDa x MeLi (14) and DaLi x DaBla (16) - were inconclusive. The even score in these first two experiments suggest that the tendency to reject the negative pattern decreases with decrease of contrast. In DaLi x DaBla contrast competes with darkness of the spots. Insufficient data are available to allow the establishment of a rank order among the different negative patterns. However DaLi appears more effective than DaMe and MeLi and this is in accordance with the rule, clearly following from the positive patterns, that the effectiveness in- creases with the contrast of the speckling. The results with the 'positive' dummies also demonstrate the higher effectiveness of a brighter over a darker groundcolour. e ii BIa Me Bla---- iDa - ) (.a Bla .--. .

Discussion More than in the other experiments on speckling it happened in tests of this series that different birds showed different preferences, or that the same bird had different preferences at different times. Preferences be- tween different birds at the time they were tested show up in the 5th column of Table 46; more than once in the exps 5 (LiMe x MeBla), 6 (LiBla x MeBla), 8 (LiMe x DaBla), 13 (MeLix DaLi), and 14 (MeDa x MeLi), and once in several other experiments. It stands to reason to attribute these differences in preference to differences in the outcome of the evaluation and heterogeneous summation of the characters mentioned in the columns 6-9 in Table 46. To us temporary shifts in the effectiveness of a feature associated with the motivation of the bird seems the most likely candidate to explain this phenomenon. For instance in exp. 5 four of the twelve gulls tested ap- peared to have preferred the brighter less contrasting LiMe over the darker MeBla-dummy with more contrast and black speckles. In exp. 6 greater brightness and contrast was preferred by 20, but greater overall darkness by 11 birds. Overall brightness is also likely to have played a role in determining the decisions in exps 8, 13 and 14. Since none of the experimental birds showed the same consistent deviations in the evalua- tion of brightness or contrast in all tests to which it was exposed, we must assume that such aberrations occur temporarily, just like the 'minority choices' we occasionally found in the series on size, on shape and on colour. The great diversity of experiments in this series of speckling makes it even more difficult than in the other series mentioned to substantiate this assumption with sound arguments. However, strong indications can be found in the records of series of trials of which Table 47a gives three ex- amples. Gull 9 012 chose 4 times in succession opposite to the majority preference. She seemed to prefer the weaker stimulus; in three cases this implied the darker of the two dummies. During the test the bird preened, which is an indication for a relatively strong escape motivation (see II.2.4.a and II.6.b). In contrast the gulls o y012 and 9 018 preferred the lighter, also more conspicuous dummy, even if the latter had a negative pattern, which is in general not preferred by the birds. These birds only performed building and re-settling as interruptive activities, indication of a high tendency to incubate (and retrieve). An experiment which produced inconclusive scores was exp. 13 (MeLi x DaLi). Both dummies have negative patterns, MeLi is lighter,</page><page sequence="144">SPECKLING 131 DaLi has more contrast; the latter dummy seemed to be slightly prefer- red. We realized that the contrast between speckles and background also made it the more conspicuous dummy of the pair. Conspicuousness of an egg dummy is not only caused by groundcolour and speckling pattern, but also by the colour and texture of the surface (nest-rim) on which the egg has been placed. Realizing the disruptive effect of the speckling on normal eggs we designed an experiment to test the effect of the con- spicuousness of the egg as a whole. Instead of placing the dummies directly on the rim we mounted them on pieces of plywood (10 x 15 cm) painted in one of the four grey tints and laid side by side on the nest-rim. In this way the conspicuousness of the same dummy could be manipulated by placing it on a different grey tone (see Plate XII). However, this experiment turned out to be difficult. Most birds got frightened by the board pieces on the nest-rim; consequently we could only carry out a very limited number of tests. The data obtained did not support the idea that contrast of the dummy with the background might be of influence on the choice made. If for making a decision the bird has to weigh and take into account the various and sometimes contradictory values of different features one would expect some experiments, or combinations of features, to be easier for the gull to solve than others. It seems likely that difficult choices would take more time. The last two columns of Table 46 give two measures for the reluctance to retrieve any of the dummies of a pair, viz.: TABLE 47a.

This distribution suggests a relationship between consistency of choice and the time taken for making the decision. A com- parison of the characteristics of the dummy pairs presented in both groups, shows that in the triangle-group preferred features had more often been put in competition with one another than in the dot-group. Consequently the triangle-group is likely to have more often forced a bird to choose for one clue and discard the other. The dot-group, on the other hand, consists of experiments with less controversial model pairs; here a consistent decision could be reached by proper weighing.

In these experiments the hightly attractive dummies LiBla and LiDa were involved, in exps 10 and 22 against low ranking com- petitors. Most likely these were the easiest decisions for the birds. In 11.6.2. and V.4. we shall further discuss the relationship between latency time and the decision procedure. Beside individually specific preferences - of either a temporal or per- manent character - the motivational state of a bird may influence the</page><page sequence="147">134 KRUIJT &amp; HOGAN-WARBURG choice. This is demonstrated in Table 47b which summarizes all the scores made by one bird, 9 012, in the season of 1956. During the first five days this bird made its decisions very much in accordance with preferences in the majority of tests. The following three days its choices were nearly all dominated by position preference and in this series the percentage of tests with preening had considerably increased, indicating that the behaviour of the bird during the tests was more often under the influence of a tendency to flee than during the first five days. The in- cidence of preening was also high on June 21 when the bird performed consistent minority decisions in 8 out of the 9 tests made on that day. The mean latency periods elapsing between arrival on the nest and retrieval of the first dummy (tt) also pointed to a greater influence of fear on 14, 15, 16 and 21 June than on 9-12 June. This difference can be considered significant (Wilcoxon-test, To =-3.61, p&lt;0.005). These data indicate that fear tends to shift the preference from strongly effective (supernor- mal) speckling patterns to weakly effective ones. We have already met such an effect when discussing the causes of consistent minority choices in the categories size and colour. As will be explained in 11.6. a strong in- fluence of fear is likely to lead to preference for the more normal looking models, a weaker influence may only reduce the difference in effec- tiveness between the dummies and consequently lead to position preference. 4. Conclusion In the above we have found that the presence of speckles on the egg is ef- fective in releasing and/or directing incubation responses. The effec- tiveness increases with the number of speckles and small speckles are more effective than larger ones. This makes us recall that, as reported in Section I, the size of the speckles tend to be inversely correlated with their number and that poorly pigmented bluish ('cyanotic') eggs often only have a small number of large spots, usually on the blunt end. It appears therefore that the effectiveness of the characteristics of the speckling pat- tern would cause a discrimination against less intensively speckled eggs, i.e. less cryptic ones. Later we shall return to this possible effect of the preference for speckling on the evolution of the egg colouration (V.6). Increase of contrast between speckling and background made the dum- my more effective. Besides, totally brighter eggs scored in general higher than darker ones. It is possible that darkness of the speckles independent- ly increased the effectiveness of the dummy, but this feature could not be</page><page sequence="148">TABLE 48.

High contrast and high reflection implies physically and probably also perceptually strong stimulation. This might account for the effectiveness of these features in most tests. However, it may also make the impact of this stimulation sensitive to differences in the motivational state of the bird. Some indications were obtained that a tendency to flee might shift the decision towards the more mildly stimulating dummy of a pair. By increasing the number of speckles, keeping them small, and paint- ing them black against a light grey background a normally sized dummy was made (sup 8Gy) that was definitely superior to the brown standard dummy (St), and consequently also to 8 BrP1 (Table 48, Plate XIV). The negative version of this dummy (sup 8neGy) was, however, almost equivalent to St but far inferior to sup 8Gy. In spite of the superiority of the positive super-egg with regard to the brown standard egg its effec- tiveness remained far below that of the real egg. In V.6 we shall come back to the problem whether through combination of highly effective features a dummy can be designed which surpasses the effect of the real object. So far we have not succeeded in accomplishing this by manipulating the speckling pattern only.</page><page sequence="150">CHAPTER 6 THE INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON THE DECISION MADE by G. P. BAERENDS and R. VODEGEL 1. Introduction In attempting to explain the occasional occurrence of consistent minority choices in a gull, such as found in the categories size and colour (pp. 56 and 109), we have found it revealing to assess the motivation of the bird when it chooses between the two dummies. For this purpose we have already in chapter 2.4. and, to a lesser extent, in chapter 5.3. of this sec- tion looked for correlations between the type of choice made (majority choice, consistent minority choice, position preference) and several addi- tional data collected during the tests which might be suitable indicators for motivation. In particular from the data on 'size' it appeared that the occurrence of minority choices was indeed related to such indicators as the time until retrieval took place (latency) and the incidence of interrup- tive behaviour during the tests. It was argued that these measurements could be used as parameters for the relative strengths of the tendencies to incubate and to flee, and the hypothesis was developed that the minority choices in the size category had been caused by the influence of a relative- ly strong tendency to flee (on account of the disturbances caused by the experiment) during the tests concerned. The results obtained in the categories shape, colour and speckling represent independent data populations in which the hypotheses involv- ing motivational state for explaining the kind of decisions made in the choice experiments, can be tested. This is the purpose of the present chapter. Moreover, the results of the various categories of experiments will be discussed comparatively. The data set on size will be included where appropriate. In the following sections first the entire data material collected will, for different categories and sub-categories, be analyzed with regard to laten- cy, a number of characteristics labelled 'binary classes' and interruptive behaviour. After having shown the existence of consistent relationships between the values of these indicators and the types of choice made, we shall try to relate these three types of indicators to each other, in order to</page><page sequence="151">138 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL finally translate the findings into terms of motivation and discuss their significance with regard to gaining insight into the procedure of informa- tion processing and decision making in the birds. In this analysis all potential indicators for the motivational state we could conceive have been incorporated. In the first place we have strived at using several indicators because one can never expect one indicator to be a pure representative for a motivational state; the state is always likely to be influenced in addition by other internal and external factors (HINDE, 1959, 1970). Secondly, since the existence and the nature of the behavioural systems could not a priori be taken for granted, we needed as much information as possible on the interrelationships between different aspects of the motor behaviour during incubation and on the relationship between these and the type of choice made to build up an argumentation for the existence of interacting systems and for satisfactorily defining them. Consequently our analysis of the data was intended to serve a twofold purpose: 1) understanding the causes of variations in the type of choice made, and 2) testing and possibly extending the hypothesis on the characteristics of the structure of the organization underlying incubation behaviour. The method followed amounts to the construction of a description of the relationships between the different aspects of incubation behaviour measured and deducing from this possible causal explanations for inter- pretating these patterns of relationships. A considerable methodological difficulty is the avoidance of circularity in this line of reasoning, since it is precisely in the definition of systems and of their interaction that no behaviour element is fully independent of the influence of others. Throughout this chapter we mean with motivational state the complex of internal factors determining the readiness or tendency to show a par- ticular behaviour pattern or to respond to a particular stimulus situation in a specific way. Following the line of thought laid down in Section II.C of Part I of this monograph, we have also in the present chapter, hypothesized that the motivational state during incubation is predominantly controlled by two antagonistic behaviour systems, a system for incubation and a system for escape. The influence of processes causing changes in responsiveness in other ways, such as sensory adapta- tion, habituation or muscular fatigue, we have tried to counteract with our experimental procedure described in II.1; it is unlikely that we have succeeded in excluding these influences altogether but they can be assum- ed to be randomly distributed over all tests.</page><page sequence="152">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 139 2. Latency As possible indicators for the motivation at the retrieval of the first dummy the latencies to (time elapsed from alighting in the territory to stepping on the nest) and t1 (time spent on the nest before retrieving the first dummy) are to be considered (see also II.1. and Fig. 6b). For this purpose the actual latencies measured have been grouped in 1 min classes, all readings below 0.5 have been classed as 0 min. 60- 2083 to 50 145 40 30 ST 20- 538681 o AS -o 10 - \ 212 - 0 2 5257 14 95 79 64 44 30 , 0 148 -- 71' 54- 34- 27"- I 70- .S .1809 60 \ ti 50 1 40 30 20Cr-s 20l cST cI AS 10- i o 01 23456789 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 latency, min Fig. 24. Distribution of the latency-values to and tl, for ST and AS for the material of all four principal categories. During t1 the bird may either first settle on the nest and rise to retrieve later (AS), or remain standing all the time before rolling the first egg (ST). Fig. 24 shows the frequency distributions of the to- and t1-periods in the two circumstances for the entire data material of the four categories: size, shape, colour and speckling. The graphs show that the distribution of the tl-values is clearly different for ST and AS (Wilcoxon test; To =-18.15). A longer delay would already be expected from the time loss caused by settling and rising, but the average for t1 (AS) is con- siderably longer (ca 2 min) than the minimum time required for this ac-</page><page sequence="153">140 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL tivity, which can be accomplished within 30 sec. The distribution of the to-values is practically equal for ST and AS for values of 2 min and over. However, as a whole both to-distributions differ significantly (Wilcoxon test; To = 5.78, p&lt; 0.001). This is due to to = 1 being relatively more fre- quent in case of AS than of ST (X2-test: p&lt; 0.0005). Because of these dif- ferences in distribution the to- and t1-latencies should be considered separately for ST and AS when investigating their possible relationship to the type of dummy choices made by the gulls. In view of the steep decline of the frequency distribution curves of the to- and t1-latencies, the most obvious method of analysis, viz. a com- parison of the choices in classes of successive one-minute periods, is un- suitable; in the higher latency-classes the influence of random fluctuation would be too strong. Therefore, we shall use cumulation as a smoothing device; i.e. we shall look for changes in the type of choices when, starting from all tests with the shortest latency, tests with longer latencies are step- wise (minute by minute) included. Per feature-category the type of choice will be expressed as: 1. the percentage taken by majority choices (i.e. first retrievals of that dummy of a pair which was preferred by the majority of the gulls tested) of all choices made, during the latency-period considered (dummy preference, code DP); 2. the corresponding percentage of decisions dominated by position preference (code PP). Thus for calculating the DP-percentages, tests dominated by position preference (minus-tests) and O-tests were pooled with the plus-tests. This was partly done because the incorporation of as many data as possible was desirable to reduce the effect of random fluctuations. In addition, however, we considered it preferable because of our opinion (see 11.7.5.) that differences between dummies had not been ignored by the birds when position preference finally dominated. It often took less time for a bird to retrieve the preferred dummy than its alternative from the favoured position. For different categories and sub-categories of egg-characteristics cumulative curves will be given representing the change in the DP- and PP-percentages with increase of the latency-period considered. The cumulative method will make conclusions about details in the course of the curves hazardous. We shall therefore only try to make a judgement of whether this course tends to rise, to fall or to remain horizontal. This judgement will primarily be made by eye. However, the reliability of the trends depicted has been checked statistically, firstly be means of apply-</page><page sequence="154">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 141 ing Wilcoxon's test in comparing the distribution of the percentages of majority choices with those for the minority choices and the distribution of the plus with the minus choices, and secondly by comparing with the X2-test the number of majority choices or of position preference choices, respectively, below and above the latency-value at which the curve shows a clear change of its course. The results of both tests were always in agreement; when p-values below 0.10 were found the curve is drawn with a heavy line (continuous for DP and broken for PP), when the course can only be considered indicative thin lines were used. We have with this pro- cedure investigated the curves (or latency-characteristics) for to (AS), to (ST) and t1 (AS). Since in the case of the ST the t1 lasted very often only 1 min or less, conclusions about the course of the t1 (ST)-characteristic were practically impossible; therefore this type of latency-period will be left out of consideration. We shall begin our discussion of the latency data with a treatment of the t1 (AS)-curves. They were found to be the most revealing, due to the fact that in the AS-situation the data are spread over a wider range of t1-values than in ST. Moreover, after the bird has stepped on the nest one would expect it to be less vulnerable to interfering influences from several factors outside the immediate nest surroundings. Figs 25-30 give the t1 (AS)-curves for different categories of ex- periments. We shall first deal with the DP-curves; thereafter the PP- curves will be discussed. The dummy-preference-curves for t1 (AS). The curve for shape (Fig. 25a) is based on all tests in which a normally sized egg-shaped dummy was presented in combination with an abnor- mally shaped dummy of equal volume (chapter 11.3., Table 29). It is clear that the percentage of preference for the normal shaped dummy in- creases with the length of the latency-period considered. This trend of the curve may be considered highly significant. We conclude that birds spending more time sitting on the nest before they retrieve are more fastidious in their choice with respect to characters of shape; they are more likely to decide in favour of a shape resembling that of the natural egg. The t1 (AS)-curve for colour, given in Fig. 25b, is based on the data of the highly preferred colour green on an egg-shaped speckled model of normal size, offered in competition with a similar model of any of the other colours described in chapter 11.5. Strikingly, the DP-curve (the</page><page sequence="155">BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL t1 (AS) SHAPE ( normal x abnormal n=246 ' o l 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 latency, min DP t1(AS) COLOUR 85- * green x other n=245 80- o_ - - _-- _ o- - o_ _(_ o pp 0 ^--^ -o-o -- -- pp 75- / -.-.. = . -._ _ DP 70- nc I I I I 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 latency, min 7 Fig. 25.

A declining tendency was also found in the DP-curve for yellow, the other supernormal colour and second on the preference scale, presented against all colours of lower rank (Fig. 26, top). However, the % DP drops only 3% when t1 rises from 0 to 1 min, compared to 12% in the curve for green against all other colours. This agrees with the conclusion drawn in chapter 5 that yellow is less effective as a supernormal stimulus than green. In contrast to the DP-curves for green and yellow, when the DP-curve for all tests of the brown dummy (the third colour in rank) against blue, red or grey dummies is considered, it appears to rise with the length of the ti-period (Fig. 26, bottom). The brown colour was more similar to the natural egg colour than any of the other colours used. Consequently, in analogy to the shape-experiments, birds preferring a dummy of a more natural appearance tend to decide after longer latencies. From these data on colour we finally conclude that the probability that supernormal colours are retrieved first is maximal with very short latency periods and decreases when the ti-latency becomes longer. This decrease with increasing latency time of the percentage majority choices (DP) for a supernormal colour goes hand in hand with an increase of the tendency to prefer close resemblance. As none of the colours of the dummies in the colour series very much resembled that of real eggs, it is not unlikely that with increasing length of the ti-periods, in these colour tests the gulls tended to drop 'colour' as a criterion for decision and switched their at- tention to another egg feature. Such a switch to another criterion might explain the apparent inconsistencies in the results with experiments in- cluding blue, yellow and brown, mentioned in II.4.3. The opposite courses of the DP-curves for shape and colour suggest an essential difference in the relation between latency and preference for normal features on the one hand and for 'supernormal' ones on the other. With regard to shape the phenomenon of supernormality could not be established, whereas with regard to colour the releasing value of green for retrieving was found far to exceed that of the more normal background colours of the natural eggs. If it would be a general rule that choice based on resemblance improves with the time taken for the deci- sion and, on the contrary, the probability that the bird will prefer a supernormal stimulus declines with this time, such a difference in latency-characteristics for tl (AS) should also be found in the categories size and speckling.</page><page sequence="157">144 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL The t1 (AS)-curves for the category size in its entirety is given in Fig. 27a. The DP-curve shows a distinct optimum which is statistically reliable. This complicated course suggests that more than one process is involved in causing the shape of these curves. In fact, as described in II.2.3.6., indeed not one but two factors (size as well as length/width pro- portion, or shape) were varied in the experiments forming this category. We have, therefore, extracted from the data those tests in which only egg- shaped models of different sizes were offered in competition. This resulted in the smoothly and significantly descending DP-curve presented in Fig. 27b. In contrast, the rest of the data, i.e. those tests in which always the shape and mostly also the size of the two dummies was different, produced curves which for DP indicate an ascending course t1(AS) SIZE () total n = 655 50- - *Dp- 50 0 0 ~o'- --o-- -O PP a. 45- -o- -o- -45 a.) : (normal proportions 8 CL 12- e!65- - 5 n=8 0 o 0 P 0 0 E 60- 0 -45 5 ,l o 0a DP U.. e abnormal proportions o n=454 a * * * DP 60- 55 0 55- ' - __ ° 0 0 -_oPP- 50 latency, min Fig. 27.

Consequently the results of the size series appear in accord with the rules just postulated. The DP-curve for pure size tests (= normal proportions) is in agreement with the curve for green against other colours; it follows the course we expected in case of a preference for supernormality. The gradual descent of the DP-curve for size only - in contrast to the steep drop of the colour curve - is possibly due to the fact that in the size series the differences between dummies were quantitatively graded, in contrast to the non-graded dif- ferences between the dummies of the colour series.

In this case this means that after longer t,-latencies the bird is more likely to choose the larger dummy among abnormally proportion- ed ones than in rapid decisions. It more carefully weighs the alternatives. This weighing was also recognized in II.2.4.d. (Fig. 9) when it was reported that for the bigger dummy to be preferred, the size difference had to be greater when that dummy had an abnormal instead of an egg- shape.</page><page sequence="159">146 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL Turning now to a third feature, the t1 (AS)-characteristic for the entire material on speckling is given in Fig. 28a. The bimodal 'wavelike' course of the DP-curve (although not statistically reliable) suggests that it might have resulted - like the DP-curve for all size tests (Fig. 27a) - from a combination of two oppositely directed curves, in which first a descend- ing and later an ascending tendency dominated. Could it be that deci- sions in favour of supernormality and preference for resemblance to the real egg are both playing an important role in this category? tl(AS) SPECKLING PP DP t1(AS) SPECKLING normal x subnormal Spo S 50 n70102 DP50 7 n=195 50 S E^ .

The DP- and PP-curves for latency t1 (AS) for: a) the sub-category 'normal versus subnormal speckling' (see for dummies used Table 42, exps. I and VI); b) the sub- category 'small versus large spots with constant total speckling surface' (Sp0'oSp4; dum- mies in Table 44 and Plate X). Of all categories the principal category 'speckling' includes the most heterogeneous collection of dummies with respect to the ways in which the features were varied. Consequently when all data are pooled con- tradictions can be expected. In contrast, classifying the data in different, more homogeneous, sub-groups could be a way to check whether indeed both decision-criteria are importantly involved in the results of the ex- periments on speckling. Unfortunately, none of the single experiments in the category speckling comprises enough tests on its own to allow an analysis of the preference percentages over different latency periods. Hence in all sub-categories to be discussed lumping of tests from a number of experiments with comparable dummies remained necessary.</page><page sequence="160">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 147 Even then the trend of most of the resulting curves can only be considered indicative. However, the fact that the various independent sub- populations of data consistently lead to the same interpretation, in our opinion outweighs the statistical weaknesses of our data. To construct the latency-characteristics of a sub-category, for each ex- periment in that category, that dummy of the pair presented which was preferred by the majority of birds, has here been incorporated in the DP- class of that sub-category. The first sub-category to be discussed contains the only two experiments on speckling in which a standard dummy was tested against a brown dummy with less speckling, either one with fewer speckles (fsp) or a plain one of the standard brown background colour (BrPl). Consequently this sub-category did not include supernormal pat- ti(AS) LI-ME-DA-BLA ( total n:755 65 n755 -40 65 A d * * DP 60 -35 ,Q__DSP _ CL 70- ( positive patterns 525 n=372 4 0 Q 9 40a *I 65- * ?DP 0.

In accordance with our hypothesis we would expect the DP-curve for this sub-category 'normal vs sub-normal' to show a rising trend similar to that of the shape curves. Fig. 29a indicates this to be true. In a second sub-category the dummies were assigned from experiments in which number and size of the speckles were varied while leaving the totality of black surface constant (Spo-'Sp4, 11.3., Table 44 and Plate X). Fig. 29b gives the DP-curve derived from these data; it tends towards the 'supernormality course'. This is in accordance with expectation, since none of the dummies bears great resemblance to the normal egg; the ma- jority preference for dummies with many small speckles found in this sub-category, must be attributed to sensitivity to supernormal stimula- tion. A third sub-category to be separately considered comprises the Li-Me- Da-Bla experiments. Fig. 30a gives the DP-curve for all tests with these dummies. The trend appears similar to that in the Spo0,Sp4 sub- category. It is the latency-characteristic for responsiveness to supernor- mality and this fits the fact that this series was designed for testing the sensitivity for discrete physical features and not for resemblance to the real egg. However, the Li-Me-Da-Bla experiments do not form a homogeneous group (see 11.5., Fig. 22, Plate XI). An obvious way to further divide them is to distinguish between a group of experiments in which the pat- terns on both dummies are 'positive' (dark spots on a light background) and negative (light spots on a dark field). The DP-curves for each of these groups are given in Figs 30b and c, respectively. For the positive patterns the downward trend is more pronounced than in Fig. 30a, and can be considered statistically significant. For the negative patterns a bimodal curve results, the difference between the %DP for a latency of one minute significantly deviates from those for latency-periods of shorter and longer duration. Thus, after having managed to demonstrate each of the two criteria for decision-making separately in different sub- categories, we have again arrived at a group of experiments the results of which can best be explained by assuming that each of the principles is ap- plicable, but in different tests. Thus in tests with short latencies the choice is likely to be made on the basis of strongly effective features such as contrast, degree of overall brightness, number and size of the spots, all processed cumulatively - whereas in tests with longer latencies resemblance of the dummy to the real egg would be the main criterion used. However, the final choice resulting from such lengthy evaluations need not necessarily deviate from the immediate reaction. Conspicuous</page><page sequence="162">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 149 and/or supernormal features dominating in short-latency decisions can conceivably be also effective after careful consideration of the two dum- mies, especially when both strongly differ from the natural egg. Super- normal spots on one of the dummies may better resemble real spots than the kind of speckling present on the alternative model. In the fourth sub-category we have put together all tests in which dum- mies of normal size and shape with a great number of black speckles on a light background (sup 8 Gy) were offered in competition with either the standard dummy (BrSp 8), or the plain brown dummy (BrP1 8), or the dummy showing a negative of the super-speckling pattern (sup 8 neGy) (for a description of the dummies see 11.5.2. and Plate X). The result is given in Fig. 28b. Again the DP-curve appears to drop towards latencies of medium length and to rise again when latencies beyond 2 min are taken into consideration. In the series of experiments included in this sub-category the supernormal dummy certainly bore in several aspects more resemblance to the real egg than the alternative (e.g. BrP18 and sup 8 neGy). The position-preference curves for t1 (AS). Most of the position preference curves are roughly the mirror images of the curves for dummy preference. This holds for shape (Fig. 25a), colour (Fig. 25b), size (Fig. 27), speckling (normal vs subnormal) (Fig. 29a), Li- Me-Da-Bla (negative) (Fig. 30c), and for the course of the curve for speckling (supernormal vs normal) for latencies up to 2 min (Fig. 28b). A course of the position preference curve opposite to that of the curve for dummy preference is to be expected when position preference would be the sole or predominant alternative for majority dummy preference. The latter is the case in the principal categories shape, colour and size. However, another alternative exists: consistent minority choices. One wonders if the occurrence of such choices might underlie the courses of the PP-curves for yellow and brown (Fig. 26), as well as for speckling (Spo0'Sp4) and Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive) which, instead of being op- posite, conform to those of the corresponding DP-curves. These two sub-categories for speckling and the one for yellow have in common that none of the dummies is likely to be very attractive to the birds, either because of a strong combination of supernormal features, or because of close resemblance to the real egg. As a consequence consistent preferences (majority as well as minority ones) will be promoted by careful weighing of the features in each of the dummies of a pair. Since weighing appears to increase with latency time, the percentage position</page><page sequence="163">150 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL preference should correspondingly show a descent in the experiments of these sub-categories. As a result the majority dummy preferences, which tended towards the moderately supernormal features, and the position preferences both peak at t1 (AS) = 0. This interpretation of the descend- ing course of these PP-curves is supported by the observation that in the sub-category 'yellow vs other colours' the incidence of minority choices was high (47% compared with 27% for 'green vs other colours') and in- creased with the length of the latency-period considered; the mean laten- cy for consistent minority choices was 2.2 min, to be compared with 1.4 min for all majority choices. The PP-curve for brown has, like the DP-curve for this colour, an ascending course (Fig. 26) which can be considered statistically signifi- cant. The ascent can be interpreted on the assumption that for snap deci- sions the birds would tend to roll the most conspicuous dummy first and only after a longer latency would pay attention to resemblance. This will not only tend to increase the probability of consistent choices in favour of brown, but also that of position preference. In matching the real eggs the brown dummies were not markedly superior to the blue and some of the grey dummies; these differences in effectiveness were not unlikely to be overruled by commonly occurring value differences between two sites on the nest-rim. Conclusion on t1 (AS). From the above discussion of the t1 (AS) characteristics for the various categories the following general conclusions can be drawn: 1. Consistent majority decisions, when made after a short tl-latency, are likely to be based on the high effectiveness of supernormal or con- spicuous stimuli (Figs 25b, 27b, 28, 29b, 30a, b). 2. If such stimuli are not present, short latency decisions are likely to be based on position preference (Figs 25a, 27c, 29a). 3. Preference for stimuli more closely resembling those of the real eggs is more likely to be shown after longer than after shorter latencies (Figs 25a, 27c, 29a). 4. Phenomenon (3) is probably brought about because a greater number of features, including stimuli of lower effectiveness, influence the deci- sion. More careful weighing of constellations of such factors may lead to consistent minority decisions which may differ, however, between individuals and in the same individual at different times. This especially holds when problems of speckling and colour are involved.</page><page sequence="164">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 151 5. In decisions made after longer latencies supernormal or conspicuous stimuli may also be effective. 6. Position preference sometimes peaks in a motivational state transitory between different ways of decision making (Figs 28b, 30c). The first three conclusions are, in our opinion, safely consolidated. The other three we consider as more speculative. This is partly because they are to a larger extent based on trends or details in the course of curves, which are, statistically speaking, insufficiently reliable. Moreover, they are based on interpretations which, with the available material, could not be sufficiently checked against other possible alter- natives. Nevertheless we think that - if applied with caution - these tentative conclusions also can contribute to a picture of the way in which the decisions are made by the birds. The to-latencies. These latency-periods are less obvious candidates for indicating the motivation of the bird during retrieval. During the to-period the gull is not in close contact with the nest and the dummies on the nest-rim; it pays more attention to the behaviour of gulls in the surroundings than during t1. Partly for this latter reason the length of to was more liable than that of t1 to be influenced by the time it took the assistant to set the test and to disappear out of sight, a time varying between tests depending on the topography of the part of the colony where the work happened to be done. Nevertheless, the relations between the characteristics for to (AS) and to (ST) were found not to be random. The to (AS)-curves for the four principal categories are given in Fig. 31. The course of the four DP-curves are essentially similar; they all show a tendency of the percentage majority choices to increase when longer latencies are additionally taken into consideration, but this trend is only statistically reliable for size. Thus, independently of whether the decision is made on the basis of the presence of strongly effective stimuli or on resemblance to the real egg, when the gull settles prior to retrieval the choice is more likely to be consistent after a longer than after a shorter delay in the territory. This conclusion is confirmed by the courses of three of the four PP-curves for to (AS), those for shape, colour and size. Only in the principal category speckling position preference did not seem to be higher for low to-latencies; an obvious explanation for this exception did not occur to us. In the next section we shall argue on the basis of binary criteria that consistent majority choices are in all categories inversely cor- related with a high tendency to retrieve. In Part I (p. 202 ff.) the tendency</page><page sequence="165">152 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL to retrieve was concluded to be positively related to the tendency to in- cubate; it will be negatively affected by a tendency to flee. Short to-values must express a relatively high tendency to incubate and a relatively low tendency to flee. Consequently the tendency to retrieve will tend to be stronger at short than at long to-latencies and this corresponds to a lower sensitivity for the features of the dummies, whatever criterion for choice is used (see also p. 169ff). Since no correlation was found between the to- and tl-latencies (p. 64) the similarity of the courses found for the prin- cipal categories with respect to to (AS) and the differentiation established above when comparing the corresponding curves for t1 (AS), are not con- tradictory.

In searching for interpretations of these differences we found it elucidating to split the principal category size into the sub-categories for dummies with normal and with abnormal linear proportions, and the category speckling into a sub-category of 'easy' and 'difficult' decisions (based on the ratio of the score in each test).

Hence, birds approaching the nest quickly, tended to do better in experiments requiring careful weighing for arriving at a majority decision, birds hesitating during to tended to score higher when decisions on supernormality were concerned (colours excepted). We are inclined to relate this conclusion to the finding that (at least for the large data population of the principal category size) to and t1 tended to be inversely correlated in ST-tests. Consequently, rapidly ap- proaching birds would wait longer before retrieving after arrival on the nest and thus take more time for their choice. Inversely, a slow approach, probably because of a relatively low tendency to incubate would lead to a quick decision, which we found to be a condition for first choice of super- normal characters. This implies that the relations between the length of t1 and the type of choice are the same for ST as for AS-tests; because of the small range over which in ST-tests tl varied, t1 (ST) curves could not be constructed directly. The PP-curves for shape, the two sub-categories for size and for colour show trends consistent with this interpretation. Those for speckling can- not be considered to diverge from horizontal. The descending course of the DP-curve for colour does not fit this in- terpretation. Although its course As not significant we would be surprised if it did not represent a real trend due to the very high attractiveness of green. We often used a green dummy to attract a gull to its nest when it seemed to give up after having been subjected to a long series of tests. When a green dummy is available a bird has to be considerably frighten- ed to retrieve the non-green alternative first. In summary, from our data on the relationships between the to-latencies and the type of choices made, we tentatively deduce the following: 1. in case of AS the probability of majority dummy choices increases for all feature-categories with the length of the to-period (at least within the 8-min margin considered). 2. in case of ST, shorter to-latencies tend to lead to majority dummy choices in feature-categories for which the choice is usually based on resemblance to the real egg, longer to-latencies to majority dummy choices in the categories for which in decision-making the cumulative effect of single characteristics prevails, and in which thus supernormal stimuli are effective.</page><page sequence="168">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION We realize, however, that these inferences are not fully covered by the data obtained and represented in the graphs. The discrepencies have been mentioned. However, to clear them up new experiments with more tests and a collection of dummies less varied and more suited to the pro- blems specified, would be needed. Conclusion. The analysis of the latency-data has revealed that a herring gull, when deciding about the retrieval of an object on the nest-rim, has at its disposal two modes of responding to this external situation. One mode, based on an interpretation of the single effectiveness of discrete features, predominates when the decision is rapid- ly made after arrival on the nest. The other mode, based on resemblance with the ap- pearance of the real egg, predominates at longer latencies. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 to latency tl Fig. 33. The frequency distributions of to (ST), to (AS) and t1 (AS) (see Fig. 24) transformed into logarithmic cumulative frequency curves. Above we have expressed the opinion that the tendency to retrieve, the strength of which we have tried to assess by means of the latency-periods, is likely to be the resultant of an interaction of the tendencies to incubate and to flee. This idea of two processes being involved in determining the moment the first dummy is retrieved was tested by plotting the cumulative frequency distributions of to (ST), to (AS) and t1 (AS) as log survivorship curves (see Fig. 33). For all three latency-classes the trend of 155</page><page sequence="169">156 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL these curves can be represented by a combination of two straight lines, intersecting at to- and tl-latencies of ca 2 min. This flexion point can be taken to reveal a change in the factors determining the distribution of the frequencies of consecutive latency classes. Its situation roughly cor- responds to the areas of maximum flexion in the DP- and PP-preference curves of Figs 25-32. We are inclined to interpret the course of the sur- vivorship curves as reflecting a change in the motivational state when the latency continues, for instance from a relatively greater influence of the incubation tendency at shorter latencies towards a greater influence of the tendency to flee at the longer ones. In the next section we shall investigate the possibilities of another kind of potential indicators for the motivational state present in the gull when it makes its decision. 3. Binary classes For each test the observer had noted down whether: a) one or two dummies were retrieved (Ir vs 2r); b) the test started with a standard brown dummy in the nest or with an empty nest-bowl (in vs On); c) the bird retrieved the first dummy before or after settling on the nest (ST vs AS); d) the bird tested was a cO or a 9. Each of these items can only have one mode; for this reason we have called them binary classes. While observing the performing bird it occur- red to us that the modes of these classes might possibly be used as in- dicators for the motivational state of the bird. As a matter of fact the number of eggs rolled into the nest-bowl (a) we have earlier (Part I, p. 200) used as a measure of the tendency to retrieve. As explained in II.1. we have used removal of the third egg from the nest-bowl (b) to manipulate the retrieval tendency. The occurrence of ST or AS (c) did not appear to be randomly distributed or to be typical for individuals. Finally we often had the impression that males and females might differ consistently in some aspects of their behaviour during the tests. We have, therefore, investigated the existence of correlations between each of the two modes of these four classes with two other binary classes viz.: e) first choice for the dummy preferred by the majority of gulls (P) versus first choice for the non-preferred dummy (NP); f) dummy preference (plus choices or+) versus position preference (minus choices or-).</page><page sequence="170">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 157 In addition we have investigated correlations between each of the two modes of the classes a to d. We shall first look for consistencies in the rela- tionships found and finally attempt their interpretation. In our data all possible combinations between the 12 modes of the 6 binary classes frequently occur. However, some combinations tend to oc- cur more often than would be expected in case of random distribution; these are the combinations we have called "relationships". We have tested their statistical reliability by means of the X2-test and decided to consider for the present purpose p&lt;0.10 as sufficient to include in the discussion. We have realized that this implies a low level of confidence. However, because of the large number of variables influencing the bird in the field, high levels may not be expected. Moreover, we think that the danger of accepting this low level of confidence can be counterarcted by a procedure which also takes the pattern of mutual relationships into ac- count. For this purpose, in addition to tabulating the data on the rela- tionships between the binary classes (Table 49), we have constructed, for each of the different categories or sub-categories of experiments con- sidered, diagrams in which all relationships are represented so that their network is pictorially visualized. The diagrams consist of two clusters, each comprising one of the alter- native modes of the binary classes, arranged to mirror each other. The relationships are expressed by connecting lines between the symbols representing the classes; continuous lines stand for significant, inter- rupted lines for non-significant relationships which might nevertheless be considered as indicative. Connections within clusters are indicated by heavy lines, those between clusters with thin lines. For each category con- sidered we have tried to distribute the alternative modes of each class in such a way over the two clusters that the number of relationship-lines crossing from one cluster to the other was as low as possible. Absence of connections between the two clusters would mean that the interrelations between the binary classes and between these and the type of choice made [majority (P) or minority (NP), consistent dummy preference ( + ) or posi- tion preference (-)] are dominated by two antagonistic internal factors. The presence of one or more connections between the two clusters points to a more complicated influence of internal and/or external factors on the classes concerned. In the following we shall first show that indeed it proved to be possible to identify consistent patterns of relationships between binary classes with the kind of first choice made. After having in this way shown the perspective of this approach we shall, in the next section, embark on the</page><page sequence="171">p aL-6'v2-a S iTs Jae i23 Ya8 J 2 HI s 2,L-O' V8-6 J5'15 0'" '0 eO J8 of 2 2 P OU-6 lJu-1. 2'22 Ie21 58 I'S I'52 O'21 0'0o fo 12 s O0-O.. i.J-6 0I5 5 0 5 pX Y o-a' i"J-d'0 I J P 0U-V2: 1u-21, 0 0 15 s 0U-2_L 1-V -v ' 4'52 '20 3 2'W0 58'2 1'08 I'2 06'2 eP'8 0o86 8 J0 P IL-6 5L-O. 2'20 'f0 055 1'8 T'oe 0'51 5 e JI s JL-o SL-6 0'33 0'25 e'03 10'6f 5 4 P JL-V2 SL-2.L '21 I3'08 12'03 32'5 58'24 1J3'2e 8'0 8'20 0 5585 0 8 I0 s I1L-2 L-V2 0 0 0 P IL- U SL- fe'3 1500 a '48 581 2 2 a I IL-0U1 SL-1U 1 25 850 Oa6 'fOO 12ao 2 0 p biln-6' JJUma-o.' 00 5 3'1 5'q6 0'15 5 2 8 s blna-a.

Diagrams are given for the same sub-divisions as used for the discus- sion of the latency-values. For each category the type of dummy con- sistently preferred by the majority of the gulls tested has been placed in the upper half of the diagram. As a consequence of this, position preference (-) always comes in the lower half. Before considering choice tests with two different dummies, in which a weighing of alternatives is always involved, it is useful to consider the network-pattern resulting from the simpler situation in which either two similar herring gull eggs or two identical dummies had been placed on 2 identical eggs n=173 o (ST\ (O) - l Fig. 34. Diagram of the relationships between binary classes in tests in which two similar real eggs or two equal dummies had been presented on the nest-rim. the nest-rim (173 tests). Consequently this diagram (Fig. 34) represents the relationships which are independent of the particular qualities of the two objects on the nest-rim. We shall call them 'intrinsic' relationships. Only two clear relations emerge. The strongest one is (ST-2r; AS-lr); X2 = 14.93, p&lt; 0.001. Since in both AS and ST the bird is standing while retrieving the egg, this relationship is probably not caused by a difference in the external situation, but rather in the internal motivation underlying 159</page><page sequence="173">160 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL these modes. The second one is (ST-On; AS-In); X2= 7.01, p&lt;0.02. This relation is most likely due to the external situation, which differed in the initial presence or absence of an egg inside the nest-bowl; On tending to induce ST and In the occurrence of AS. This is in agreement with the result presented in Table 20 of Part I that 40% of the gulls finding their nest empty refused to settle on it, compared with only about 2% when the nest contained one or more eggs. Because of the strong relationships of ST with 2r and On and of AS with Ir and In one would not have been surprised to find an equally strong relationship (On-2r; In-lr). On the contrary, this relationship was only weakly indicated (X2 = 1.35) in the population of 'equal object' tests, suggesting that the underlying causes for the relations between On/in and lr/2r must be more complicated. Be- tween '/Q9 on the one hand and lr/2r or ST/AS on the other no signifi- cant relationships exist. We shall consider the diagrams for the four principal categories first; they are given in Figs 35, 36, 37, 38. The simplest network, i.e. the one with the smallest number of cross connections between both clusters is that for the principal category "shape" (Fig. 35). It represents the rela- tions for all tests dealt with in chapter 3 (Table 29) in which an egg- shaped dummy (P) was given in competition with an abnormally shaped one of the same (normal) volume. Preferences for the normally shaped egg (P) more often occurred in combination with Ir and On. First retrievals of abnormally shaped dummies (NP) occurred more often in combination with 2r and In. Moreover, 99 more often than O'rotended to choose the normally shaped dummy first. Apart from the relationship- pair (AS - In; ST - On) - once of the 'intrinsic' relations in Fig. 34 - all relations between the various criteria fall within one of the two clusters of the diagram. This strongly suggests that the combinations of modes found in each cluster are representative for different motivational states; in the upper constellation of a state favouring majority choices in the shape-category and in the lower constellation of a state favouring position-preference choices. The diagrams of the other three principal categories (all tests on size, Fig. 36; green versus all other colours, Fig. 37; all tests on speckling, Fig. 38) collectively differ from the diagram for shape. Compared with that diagram the most important change is the appearance of the significant relationship (P-ST; NP-AS). Further the relation (Ir-plus; 2r-minus) has disappeared in the categories colour and speckling and even become reversed (Ir-minus; 2r-plus) in the category size. Finally in these three categories 9 is not more often related with P and ( + ) than (Y; on the con-</page><page sequence="174">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 161 shape n=420 Fig. 35.

In the colour category the representa- tion of the relationship of 0 with the other classes is only slightly better when oC is placed in the upper and 9 in the lower half of the diagram. When the data of the category speckling are considered in total, C0 fails to show ties with the upper and 9 with the lower constellation; only two non-significant relationships with the opposite constellation are in- dicated. We shall first discuss the relationships of ST/AS, lr/2r, On/in and a//9 with P/NP and plus/minus. All four diagrams agree in that the rela- tionships (P-On; NP-ln) and (P-lr; NP-2r) are significantly exhibited. This further holds for the relationships (plus-On; minus-in) and (plus-P; minus-NP). The latter relation, however, is of no further interest because it is implied in the definition of plus- and minus tests (II.1.2.). We must remember that the P-group comprises beside consistent majority choices also a considerable number of position preference choices for the generally preferred dummy. In the NP-group, beside position preference choices, consistent minority dummy choices also occur, but the latter category is so rare that in the NP-group position preference dominates and thus determines the relationships (P-plus; NP-minus). Looking at the four diagrams it is obvious that the number of significant relationships is higher for size than for colour and lowest for speckling. These differences should be partly attributed to differences between the four principal categories in the total number of tests and partly to the amount of variation between the different experiments each category in- corporates. The high consistency of the picture for shape must be due to the fact that in this category shape only was varied; the amount of tests involved was relatively low (498). In the size-category the properties size and shape have been varied, but the number of tests is much higher (1690). For colour less tests were made (575) and 12 different hues were used. The principal category speckling includes 1645 tests, but has by far the greatest heterogeneity between the different experiments. Despite the uncertainties in some of the relationships we are of opinion that our data justify the conclusion that in principle two constellations of the diagram suffice to represent the relationships found between binary classes in the four main-categories. The essential differences between these constellations are: 1. for the shape diagram the combination of AS and 9 with consistent dummy preferences ( +) directed at the generally preferred dummy (P), and of ST and a with position preference (-) and a higher in- cidence of first retrievals for the generally not preferred dummy (NP); 2. for the diagrams for size, colour and speckling the combination of ST and probably cy with ( + ) and P, and of AS and probably 9 with NP and (-). Acceptance of this conclusion suggests the interpretation that the second type of diagram would be typical for choice situations in which</page><page sequence="177">164 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL supernormal features are effective, whereas the first type would fit the experiments in which supernormality in the object is absent. Thus this emergence of two types of relationship-patterns supports the dichotomy in the latency characteristics established in the earlier part of this chapter. Just as for latency we can verify this dichotomy hypothesis by con- structing the binary classes diagrams for the four sub-categories of speck- ling. We would expect those for supernormal vs normal speckling and for the Spo0^Sp4 series to conform to the diagram holding for colour and size, whereas the sub-category normal vs subnormal should correspond to the diagram of the shape category. Because of the heterogeneous composition of the Li-Me-Da-Bla category a further subdivision of these data will ease the interpretation. The diagrams for these sub-categories have been given in Figs 39-44. Because the amount of data for most of these diagrams is considerably smaller than for the principal categories, it is not surprising that the reliability of the relationships obtained is on the average lower. Never- theless, the constellations which could be constructed with the available data largely support the dichotomy hypothesis. The diagrams for the sub-category Spo0"Sp4 (Fig. 39), which has a tt (AS)-curve typical for supernormality (Fig. 29b), matches the diagram for size. The same is true for the sub-category 'supernormal vs normal' (Fig. 40). However, although in both diagrams ST and Co come in the up- per cluster and AS and Q in the lower, the relationships between ST/AS and o/9 in Fig. 39 (ST-cr; AS-9) tends to be the reverse of that in Fig. 40 (ST-oa; AS-9). In contrast, the diagram for the totality of tests of the 'Li-Me-Da-Bla'-series (Fig. 41) is similar to the diagram for the category shape. The diagram for 'normal vs sub-normal' speckling (Fig. 42) is in accordance with that picture as far as the position of AS is concerned, viz. in the upper cluster, thus not connected with NP as in the supernormality constellation (e.g. size, colour). However, C and 9 have landed in the same clusters as in the 'normal vs sub-normal' diagram. It is clear that the position of the sexes in the network is less consistent than that of the other binary classes. We shall try to explain this in the next section. The Li-Me-Da-Bla data have - as in the preceding section on laten- cies - been subdivided into a population with a relatively high and one with a relatively low incidence of supernormal features (positive patterns and negative patterns, respectively). The group of positive patterns shows ST in the upper and AS in the lower half of the diagram (Fig. 43);</page><page sequence="178">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 165 speckling: Spo r\ Sp4 n=298 ,r NP Fig. 39.

This result is in agreement with the corresponding t1 (AS)-curves; the curves for two dummies with positive speckling following clearly the supernormality course (Fig. 30b), the other at least partly the course for resemblance (Fig. 30c). However, 9 features in both diagrams in the up- per andO cin the lower cluster, but the relation (9-AS; c-ST) is much stronger when negative patterns are involved than the reversed relation- ship (9-ST; cy-AS), prevailing in the population of tests with two dum- mies with positive patterns (Table 49). Because of the presence of super- normality in several dummies with positive patterns, we would have ex- pected oC to feature in the upper and Q in the lower half of the Li-Me-Da- Bla diagram. However, we should keep in mind, that not all dummies with positive patterns are likely to bear supernormal features and that consequently, beside preference for such features, a careful weighing of the properties of the models may also play a role in this sub-category. We shall return to this in the next section, when the apparent inconsistencies in the cy/9 versus P/NP will be discussed in general terms. The relationships between ST/AS, lr/2r, On/In and Co/9, as shown in the distribution of the modes over the upper and the lower clusters of the diagrams, show an amount of variation between the various categories. We shall discuss these variations after having in the next section first tried to interpret the two modes of these four binary classes in terms of the motivational state of the bird. With this information we shall also try to understand the causal background of the two types of diagrams found and their linkage with different latency-characteristics. 4. The interpretation of the binary classes After having established in the foregoing section that particular patterns of the modes of the binary classes tend to be correlated with the type of choice made in the tests, we should now ask how far we can equate these modes with the motivational state of the bird during the test. On the basis of the model developed in Part I 2C for the organization of the behaviour during incubation, we should in particular expect interactions between the tendencies to incubate and to escape. Arguments have been given that all activities of the bird concerning the eggs and the nest, including egg retrieval, are under the command of a control system for incubation. Any disturbance in or near the nest, but also further away in the colony, activates the tendency to escape to some extent and this was found to go hand in hand with a lowering of the tendency to incubate. The variation</page><page sequence="182">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 169 in latency-periods was likely to be influenced by both tendencies and hence we were unable to analyse how much each tendency actually con- tributed to a type of choice. In the following we shall consider in how far the binary classes can be utilized for assessing the motivational state. a) The number of dummies retrieved (lr or 2r). In Part I (p.202 ff) the number of eggs moved into the nest-bowl was used for assessing the tendency to retrieve, presenting three similar unfix- ed eggs on the nest-rim. The results proved to correspond well with another measurement of the tendency to retrieve; viz. the frequency of attempts to roll an egg model which was pegged on the nest-rim. We may therefore take 2r as an indication of a higher tendency to retrieve than lr, but we also would like to know how in the bird this tendency to retrieve is controlled. On the basis of correlations between these measurements and measurements of other activities associated with incubation it was postulated that the tendency to retrieve is under control of the N-system as defined in Part I (see Fig. 67): the general incubation system. If this is accepted, r = 1 may be considered as indicative of a relatively low and r = 2 as a relatively high activation of this system. However, when inter- preting the values found in the present experiments, one should realize that - in contrast to the test situation dealt with in Part I - the objects on the nest-rim were not two similar real eggs but two different artificial dummies. One should realize that dummies, especially such of unnatural appearance, might be unattractive or even frightening to the bird and thus might negatively influence or inhibit the expression of an internal tendency to retrieve to differing extents dependant on the nature of the dummies presented. This follows, for instance, from comparing the latency periods for rolling the second egg (t2) in tests in which two equal objects, either eggs or dummies, were presented on the nest-rim. In only 19.5% of 108 tests with two real eggs were the t2-values above 10 min, in contrast to 44.7% of 73 tests with two identical egg-dummies. In addi- tion, analysis of 130 tests in which a gull egg was presented against some kind of dummy showed that when the model was retrieved after the real egg, the t2-latency exceeded 10 minutes in 52% of the 82 tests involved, whereas this occurred in only 31 % of the 48 choices in which the gull egg was retrieved last (in which case position preference was mostly im- plicated). It also clearly appears when for different categories and sub- categories the percentage of tests in which the preferred and non- preferred dummies were in the second place retrieved, or even abandon- ed, are compared. Table 50 makes this comparison possible; it clearly</page><page sequence="183">170 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL TABLE 50.

Moreover, among the preferred dummies the brown and the green normal-sized egg-shaped dummies, which were both found attractive, are less likely to be left on the nest-rim than dum- mies of other colours. Of the usually non-preferred dummies those with enlarged spots and some of the Li-Me-Da-Bla-dummies ran a high chance of being abandoned. The constellations of relationships between modes of the binary classes have been constructed independently of latency values. For our insight in the behavioural network it is interesting to look at the relationships be- tween these constellations and the latencies to and t1 and this may also facilitate the interpretation of these configurations in terms of behavioural systems. We expect the latency periods to be inversely correlated with the tendency to incubate and positively with the tendency to flee. Table 51, column I has been composed for comparing the modes of the binary classes with the values for the latencies to and tl. The relation between t1 and the number of eggs retrieved is clear and similar for all principal categories: Ir tends to go with longer, 2r with shorter tl-periods. As this relationship is clearly present in all categories it must be largely indepen- dent of the appearance of the dummies on the nest-rim. This supports the conclusion that the number of eggs retrieved is a function of the tendency to incubate. The to-latencies for shape and speckling also tend to be longer for Ir than 2r, but for size and colour no difference was found. The absence of</page><page sequence="184">TABLE 51.

In the former two categories at least one of the dummies was often very conspicuous. If conspicuousness is responsible for the absence of a relationship between to and r, it is clear that the influence of the egg must already be effective before the gull has stepped on the nest, either by speeding up the return of the bird or by slowing it down. Differences found in the mean values of to suggest that a speeding up tended to take place in tests with green dummies (mean to = 1.76) and a slowing down in tests with oversized ones (mean to = 3.25) whereas the means in tests for shape (to = 1.18) and for speckling (to = 2.10) are in between. We conclude that r - as a measure of the tendency to retrieve - is likely to be mainly controlled by the tendency to incubate, but that characters of the dummies may additionally influence whether the second dummy is rolled in. b) The initial number of eggs in the nest-bowl (On or In). As mentioned before (II. 1.2.), in principle each series of consecutive tests with a gull during a parental shift (for definition see Part I, p. 15) began with one brown standard model in the nest-bowl (In). Only if the gull had not responded with retrieval in two or more consecutive tests, were the following tests started in the On situation. From the experiments described in Part I (pp. 205, 268) it can be accepted that taking eggs from the clutch tends to increase the tendency to retrieve, because of the enlarged discrepancy between the expected and the actual feedback stimulation. We must assume that birds in which retrieval had to be ac- tivated this way experienced a lower tendency to retrieve before they came in tactile contact with the nest-bowl than birds for whom this extra stimulus was not needed. One might say that by this procedure the tendency to retrieve was roughly measured. We should, however, realize that this tendency to retrieve is not only influenced by the internal state of the bird but also by the characters of the dummies on the nest rim. However, since we only switched from In to On after at least two con- secutive failures to retrieve, i.e. after at least four different models had been presented, we believe that the influence of the dummy type on the On/In class must have been relatively minor. If the switch from In to On would in general have been made when the incubation tendency had dropped below a certain threshold, one would expect this switch to have taken place more often the higher the rank number of the test in a paren-</page><page sequence="186">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 173 tal shift, and thus probably coinciding with a low level of the incubation tendency (Part I, p. 181 ff). Fig. 45 shows that this is not the case. The frequency of the switch was highest in the beginning of the series and dropped to a constant level for ranknumbers higher than the 5th test. To us this indicates that in the tests 3, 4 and 5 an influence counteracting the tendency to incubate must have been relatively powerful. This must have been the tendency to escape, stimulated by the disturbing situation on the nest-rim. As would be expected this fear declines (habituates) in the course of successive tests. 50 20 - 30 - 20 oall data o-10 . (( *66 3 4 5 6 7 8 rank order of tests in series Fig. 45.

Usually, when a series was continued for a long time in the On-situation a number of tests with a high incidence of 2r was gradually followed by an increasing incidence of Ir, until finally the gull refused to roll any of the two dummies into the nest-bowl and even discontinued in- cubation. Soon it no longer came back to the nest but remained standing on its roost in the territory. At that stage the tendency to incubate seemed to have reached a minimum, but also the escape tendency was low, since an immediate return of the bird could nearly always be elicited by placing one or more real eggs, or also an attractive (e.g. green) dummy into the nest-bowl, i.e. by improving the external situation stimulating the in- cubation activities.</page><page sequence="187">174 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL The relations of the latencies to and t1 with the inital nest-bowl content in the four main-categories of experiments do not reveal an obviously consistent picture (Table 51, column II). In the categories shape and speckling the occurrence of In is correlated with short to-values and that of On with long ones, but in the size and colour categories the relation is reversed. This reversal is only significant for size and is, as shown by Table 51c in which the category size has been split into egg-shaped and abnormal-shaped dummies, mainly due to the experiments with over- sized abnormally shaped models for which we have earlier concluded that the frightening effect was higher than for the normally shaped ones (see also p. 54). Shorter to-latencies in In-tests for shape and speckling fit the assumption that In corresponds to a higher tendency to incubate than On. That this relation is reversed for size and colour might be due to an in- crease of the escape tendency caused by the greater conspicuousness from a distance of the dummies used in these categories. This takes into ac- count that conspicuous stimuli will more often be effective and retard ap- proach in the beginning of a series of tests with a bird, thus when it is still offered In, than later on when the experimenter has switched to On. The tl-latencies are in the categories speckling, colour and shape shorter (in the latter case insignificantly so) for the On- than for the In-situation (Table 51b). This can be understood as a result of the dif- ference in feedback-discrepancy between both situations, especially when AS occurs. In the size category the opposite picture was found. This reversal might again be attributed to the relatively strong frightening ef- fect of oversized models. From these data we conlude that In indicates a higher tendency to retrieve than On. This difference can be due to differences in strength of the tendency to incubate, but the lack of response which made the experimenter decide to switch to On may also have been caused by fright of the birdfor the experimental situation (in particular in the beginning of a series of tests). The criterion On/ n is beset by two possible sources of error. First, after it was decided to switch from In to On presentations, no systematic attempts were made during the same series to check whether the tendency to retrieve might have risen again. The need to economize on the number of tests prevented us from making this control. Second, it sometimes happened, especially in the beginning of the season, that during a On presenta- tion instead of the expected bird its mate arrived at the nest and thus started a series of On without having been adjusted for. Both errors have as a consequence that In is a more reliable indicator of a relatively high tendency to retrieve than On is of a low one. c) The posture of the gull before making its decision (ST or AS). In this and some preceding chapters evidence has already been given that the posture the gull assumes on the nest just before retrieving the first</page><page sequence="188">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 175 dummy is likely to be influenced by internal motivational as well as by external factors. Here we shall try to survey all evidence in order to assess what information ST or AS can give about the motivation during the choice. First, data on the relationship between the nest-situation and the percentages of tests with ST can be obtained from the Tables 23, 24 and 36 in Part I of this monograph. From them Table 52 has been composed. For tests in which one or two eggs were lying on the nest-rim these data show a tendency of the % ST to decrease with reduction of the number of eggs in the nest-bowl at the start of the test. This indicates that when the nest-situation is moderately disturbed the gull is more likely to settle before it retrieves than to remain standing. Since the mean to-latencies are shorter for complete than for incomplete clutches and also for two eggs on the nest-rim than for one, we conclude that the presence of eggs (in the nest-bowl as well as on the nest-rim) promotes a quick return to the nest. Thus, comparison of the incidence of ST in different test- situations with the to-latencies under those circumstances allows the con- clusion that ST tends to occur in gulls showing relatively little hesitation to return to the nest. In Part I (Table 37) birds retrieving after ST were more often found to perform building than preening as interruptive behaviour during the tests, which complies with this conclusion. Further the last column of Table 52 shows that the length of ti decreased with the number of eggs in the nest-bowl, in accord with the earlier made state- ment that a satisfactory feedback from the nest-bowl is a factor inhibiting retrieving. No data are available from Part I with regard to the influence of the number of eggs present on the nest-rim on the t1-values. Another way to assess the motivation of the bird during ST is to com- pare the incidence of this posture between tests in which highly and in which weakly effective dummies were presented. The tests of the categories colour and speckling can be classified in accordance with these criteria; this has been done in Table 53. In the class containing the green, yellow or brown dummy the percentage ST was significantly higher than in the class with blue, red and grey. When a supernormally speckled dummy was present the percentage ST was higher than with a normally speckled one. Both of these speckling classes had a higher percentage ST than the abnormally looking Li-Me-Da-Bla presentations. Within the Li- Me-Da-Bla category negative patterns had a lower incidence of ST than positive ones. The distribution of On (which is more likely to induce ST than AS) did not differ between the classes concerned. We conclude that the percentage ST is positively correlated with the tendency to retrieve.</page><page sequence="189">176 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL TABLE 52.

The relations between latency and the incidence of AS and ST in the material of the present experiments can be considered on the basis of Table 51, column III. For all categories ST tends to go together with short t1-latencies and AS with longer ones. In all categories the percen- tage of tests with AS was found to increase with the length of t1 (Fig. 46 for all categories, Fig. 12 for size only). From this we conclude that a bird performing AS after having arrived on the nest, is more inhibited to retrieve than a bird rolling after ST. In contrast the same figures show a gradual decrease of the percentage AS, and thus a rise of ST, with an increase of the to-latency. This relation is also expressed in column III of Table 51: with the exception of the category shape, the incidence of AS tends to be correlated with to-latencies below 2 min and that of ST with higher latency values (but only significantly so for speckling). Table 54, based on the size-category shows that this increase of the % ST with longer to-values is also found when a population of only In-tests is considered, thus with a constant ex- ternal stimulus, favouring AS, in the nest. The apparent contradiction between our first conclusion that ST is characteristic for birds which do not hesitate, and the rise found in the percentage ST-tests with increasing to-latency, is explained and removed when one realizes that during the to-period the tendency to avoid the disturbed nest is decreasing. The longer this process continues the less hesitant is the bird when stepping in the nest and the higher the pro- bability that it retrieves after ST. The average t1-value for tests with AS was about 4 times as long as for tests with ST and considerably longer than a bird would actually need for</page><page sequence="190">TABLE 53.

This indicates that when settling before retrieving, the bird is in a motivational state which inhibits it from performing the retrieving and shifting procedures. Since settling is the ultimate appetitive activity leading to incubation, it is logical to attribute the occurrence of AS-tests to a relatively high incubation tendency. The postponement of retrieval must than be due to the influence of a tendency to escape and the length of the t1 (AS)-latency to the relative strength of this tendency. This interpretation explains why AS occurred in all categories more often than ST in the earlier period of the season and in the lower rank numbers of a series of consecutive tests. For the category 'size' this has already been shown in Figs 12b and c. For the other three categories the ratio of AS- over ST-tests was 1.7 in the first half of the season against 1.3 in the second half (X2 = 20.6, p&lt; 0.0005), and 0.8 in the first tests of a series against 0.6 in the rest (X2= 3.61, p&lt; 0.10). 100- * tl _ . 80- / = 60-"' Cl) - / ~~1. 40- ....'......u-------to o40- 20- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 latency time in min. Fig. 46. Change of the ratio ST/AS with increase of the latencies to and t1. We thus conclude that AS indicates a reluctance to retrieve which is not due to a low tendency to incubate but to fright for the stimulus situation; while the length of tj (AS) corresponds to the strength at which the escape system is interfering with the complete performance of incubation behaviour. In contrast, ST mostly indicates a high tendency to retrieve. Only in combination with long tl-latencies it may occur at a low tendency to roll, which then is probably not due to fright but to a low tendency to incubate. In our data the latter type of ST-tests will be in a minority com- 178</page><page sequence="192">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 179 TABLE 54.

Differences in the frequency distribution of to between the sexes have been given in Table 51, column IV. The distributions appear to be dissimilar foro and 9; the differences in to-distribution show up best when groups of tests with latencies up to 2 min are compared with groups of tests with longer to-latencies. Although the difference is not great and only approaches statistical reliability in a few categories, the fact that it occurs independently in all principal categories, and also in the four sub- categories of speckling, gives confidence that it is real. Since short to-latencies may be due to a relatively high tendency to incubate, to a low tendency for escape or to both in combination, we should conclude that during the tests 99 had on the average a higher tendency to incubate and/or a lower tendency to flee than ro'. However, in spite of the higher incidence of short to-values, 99 showed a higher average for to-latencies than 'o. This was due to a more frequent occurrence of relatively long to-values in 99 than in crO. For instance, in the size-category the mean to for OCr was 2.39 min; that for 99 was 2.90 min, due to a more frequent occurrence of high to-values(&gt;9 min) in 99 (10%) than in o0r(6%); X2= 7.22, p&lt;0.01. As it is clear from characteristics of the behaviour (sleeked plumage, long necks, frequent alarm calls) of the birds that such long to-latencies are primarily due to fear and not primarily to a low incubation tendency we conclude that 99 are frightened more easily than coy. Thus, if 99 hesitate in returning to the nest they tend to wait longer than oCr. The tl-values for99 were found to be higher than those for O'r, except for the principal category speckling in its totality. Splitting up this category in Table 51 reveals that this reversal is due to the sub-categories</page><page sequence="193">BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL 'normal vs subnormal' and 'supernormal vs normal' the two sub- categories in which at least one of the dummies did not deviate strongly from the natural colour pattern (thus in contrast to the Li-Me-Da-Bla and Spo0\,Sp4 series) and of which therefore the frightening effect must have been smaller. Thus, when 99 find familiar looking dummies on the nest-rim, their higher incubation tendency makes them on the average retrieve more quickly after arrival on the nest than cycO. However, in con- frontation with most dummy pairs 99 are more easily intimidated than Ocow and in that case their tl-latencies become extended. TABLE 55.

These data show that, after arrival on the nest, Oct more quickly decide to retrieve in the In than in the On situations. In the 99 this difference is only weakly indicated. We conclude that 9 9 are generally less sensitive to the nest content: a threshold lowering likely to be due to a higher tendency to incubate. Independently another fact argues in favour of the idea that 99 tend to have a higher incubation tendency than cow: as shown in Table 56 the relative share of 99 in series of tests increases with the rank number of the tests in a series. Since birds normally do not leave their nest before their mate has arrived we must assume 99 to spend on the average shorter periods away from the nest than ccr. Fig. 47 shows for the data of the size-category that the percentage of tests with On was for tests of each rank number higher for tests with 99 than for tests with o'or. The same was found in the other categories. Similarly, Fig. 45 shows for all categories together that for the rank numbers 3 to 6 it was more often found necessary in tests with 9 9 to remove the egg from the nest-bowl to obtain a retrieving response than in tests with aro. Above we have argued that the steep decline in the first 180</page><page sequence="194">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION part of this curve implies that On should not be seen as an indication of low incubation tendency alone, but that the removal of the egg must also be effective in overcoming fright for the dummies. Obviously this is more often necessary in 99 than in ocy. If 99 have on the average a higher tendency to incubate we would ex- pect to have more often seen a 9 relieving a t than the reverse. In fact during all the tests in the course of years 295 times a 9 came to relieve a CY and 228 times we saw a o relieving a 9 (X2 = 4.18, p &lt; 0.05).

This bird was in 224 cases a 9 and in 143 cases a a (X2 = 8.87, p &lt; 0.001). On the average 99 Q stayed on the experimental nest for 6.04 tests, cr0' for 5.14 (Wilcoxon-test, TO = -3.48, p&lt;0.01). GOETHE (1937) also reported differences in incubation behaviour be- tween the sexes. According to him 9 9 spend more time on incubation than Cy7o; in one pair which he followed for a longer period, the 9 spent twice as much time on the nest as the 0C. Furthermore he found 99 less  181 -</page><page sequence="195">182 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL often to abandon nests into which he had put alien objects. When both partners had landed in the territory after an alarm, GOETHE found that the 9 more often started approaching towards the nest than the cr. Only DRENT (1970) has measured the total amount of time spent on in- cubation by males and females during the entire incubation period. In contrast to the conclusions of GOETHE and ourselves, he found the share of both sexes to be equal. This difference might be due to the fact that on- ly the colony where DRENT did his measurements was otherwise left un- disturbed. It is possible that although both sexes normally spent equal time on incubation, the persistence of the incubation tendency against disturbance is higher in females than in males. In his experiments on begging in herring gull chicks PETERS (1953) found indications for sex differences in responsiveness in chicks. Female chicks appeared to have a stronger tendency to react in general, whereas male chicks seemed to pay more attention to the structure of the percep- tual field. These observations are interesting but the data are insufficient to allow interpretations. For instance, one would like to know whether or not both phenomena are causally related; if so it is conceivable that the tendency to react influences the amount of attention paid, as well as the reverse. From the evidence given here we think we may conclude that on the average 9Q are likely to have a higher incubation tendency than o'o but are more easily influenced by frightening stimuli. e) Binary classes and t2-latency. The second dummy may be retrieved immediately after the first one (t2 = 0), while the bird is still standing. However, the average t2-latency is of the order of 2 min; in this period the bird often settles again. So far we have not used the t2-values in our attempts to evaluate the significance of the binary classes. Table 57 gives a survey of the t2-distributions found. For each class Wilcoxon's-test was used to check the significance of differences in distribution of the t2-latencies between its two modes. If such a difference was found it has been indicated for which mode of the class the latencies tend to fall above and for which below 1 min. Most cells of the table show significant differences, which are within each class consistent for the four principal categories. The incidence of On tended to be combined with higher and that of In with lower t2-values in all four categories (Table 57, column II). With regard to the feedback from the clutch one would have expected the op-</page><page sequence="196">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 183 TABLE 56.

We must therefore conclude that the internal motivation is responsible and that the high tendency to retrieve, which made the experimenter leave an egg in the nest-bowl at the start of the test still prevailed in the t2-period. Furthermore, birds performing AS during ti tended to be more</page><page sequence="197">184 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL reluctant to retrieve the dummy in the t2-period than gulls in ST-tests (column II) and also 99 tended to show longer t2-latencies than cCO (column IV). These conclusions are in agreement with those drawn from considering the relations of On/In, AS/ST and c/Q with the tl-latencies. Implicitly these facts justify our method of assessing the motivation during the decision of the bird from measures made at different times during the test period. It is interesting to note that the type of distribution of the t2-latencies over On and In, as mentioned in the above paragraph, is opposite to that found for t1 in the categories, shape, colour and speckling (Table 51, column II). We think that this is because in t1 the effect of the external situation dominated over that of the internal motivation. The external in- fluence on retrieval in the On tests is in general strong for two reasons: during t1 the nest-bowl is still empty, and two dummies are lying on the nest-rim. 5. The interpretation of the diagrams for the binary classes in terms of motivational state In section 3 of this chapter we came to the conclusion that the constella- tion of the relationships between the modes of the binary classes was dif- ferent for populations of tests in which supernormal features could be chosen and populations of tests in which besides normal features only less effective, i.e. subnormal features were present. In section 4 we have given interpretations to the modes of each of the binary classes; a survey of them is given in Table 58. In the present section we shall with the help of these interpretations try to assess the causal motivational background of the two types of constellations. We shall aim not only at interpreting the type of choice on the basis of the motivational state of the gull, but also consider its entire behaviour during the tests. The relations between the two modes of the binary classes are necessarily paired. For instance, if In is correlated with AS, On is conse- quently correlated with ST, and the reverse. It is in principle possible that each member of such a pair contributes to the relation, but if the cause for a relationship would be entirely located in one member, the complementary relationship automatically results. For the interpretation of the correlation of particular relationships between binary classes with particular types of choices, in terms of the motivation during decision making, it is important to know whether one member of a relationship- pair has a relatively larger share in the establishment of the relation.

Sometimes the occurrence of considerable differences in the frequency of occurrence of each of the two modes of the two binary classes involved in a relationship gives a lead towards detec- ting asymmetry; for this and other purposes this data is given in Table 59. We have also attempted to obtain insight in the causation of particular relationships between binary classes by a further division of the data, especially by comparing the strength of the various relationships between populations of tests each characterized by one of the two complementary modes of each class. Thus we have compared the binary relationships separately for the P- and NP-choices, for the plus- and minus-choices, for the On- and the In-tests, for the Ir- and 2r-tests, for the AS- and the ST-</page><page sequence="199">186 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL tests and for tests with males and females. We have done this separately for the principal categories shape, size, colour and speckling. However, we shall refrain from reporting about this analysis completely in this paper. Such a treatment would fill several pages of text, figures and tables and would be very tedious to read. We shall, therefore, suffice first with the general statement that by this more detailed procedure no evidence has been forthcoming which contradicted with the facts and conclusions given here. Second, we shall only specifically discuss those cases where the splitting procedure seems to have extended our views. A considerable draw-back of this procedure is that it leads to small numbers of tests in each sub-set of data. For this reason we have restricted this comparison to the category 'size', being the largest and most homogeneous category in which supernormality occurs, and the unfor- tunately much smaller but also rather homogeneous category 'shape', in which dummy preference was found to be based on resemblance. In the following we shall first discuss the relationships found between the type of choice made - majority choice (P) vs minority choice (NP) and consistent dummy choice (plus) vs position preference (minus) - and the modes of the other four binary classes. P/NP vs lr/2r and On/In. In all diagrams of the principal categories (Figs 35, 36, 37, 38) significant correlations exist of P with Ir and On on the one hand, and of NP with 2r and In on the other. Although for the sub-categories these relationships were mostly not statistically significant, the reverse relationship was nowhere found. For the interpretation of these relationships in terms of differences in motivation between P- and NP-choices, it is elucidating to look separate- ly at populations of plus- and minus-tests. Diagrams for such populations of the categories size and shape are given in Fig. 49 (p. 196). One dif- ference between the four diagrams is the presence of a significant (P-On; NP-ln) relation in both diagrams for plus-tests and its absence in both minus-diagrams. Considering that P-choices constitute about 75% of the tests in the plus-group but only 50% in the minus-group, it is likely that the relation (P-On; NP-ln) is actually due to (P-On) with (NP-ln) being the 'passive' complementary part. The relationship (P-lr; NP-2r) occurs in three of the four diagrams of Fig. 49. It is absent in the plus-diagram for the category size (Fig. 49a), probably because consistent choices for the smaller dummy mainly occur when the tendency to retrieve is very low. Thus, both P and NP are more</page><page sequence="200">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 187 likely to go with Ir than 2r. A plus-diagram in which all categories with supernormality were lumped did show the (P-lr; NP-2r) relation. The causation of this relationship is likely to differ between the plus- and the minus-populations. In the minus-group it is probably based on (NP-2r); after choosing the NP-dummy as a result of position preference, the birds will tend to roll the P-dummy soon thereafter because of its attrac- tiveness. Although in the plus-category the same may happen in case of consistent NP-choices, the number of these minority choices is too small to have a decisive influence on the relationship (P-lr; NP-2r). Therefore, in the plus-category, (P-lr) must be the cause of this relationship. Since the percentage of P-choices in the plus-group was greater than that of the NP-choices in the minus-group, it is in accord with this conclusion that the relationship (P-lr; NP-2r) was much stronger in the plus- (X2 is 9.4 for the supernormality-group and 27.6 for shape) than in the minus- populations (X2 is 5.5. for the supernormality-group and 5.1 for shape). For all principal categories this relationship (P-lr; NP-2r) held more strongly for populations of tests with In than for those with On, probably because in In-tests the feedback deficiency during t2 was less, and often not strong enough to lower sufficiently the threshold for retrieval of the second dummy. In the face of these data the conclusion seems justified that a first choice for P is promoted by a relatively low tendency to retrieve, as ex- pressed by On and In. This relationship exists in all categories and conse- quently is independent of whether the P-choice is linked with supernor- mality or resemblance. It cannot be the immediate result of the kind of dummies presented and should thus be attributed to internal factors. The diagrams do not allow a conclusion on how the opposite tendencies to incubate and to escape (= avoiding the experimental situation), hypo- thesized to determine the level of the tendency to retrieve, might in- teract. Plus/Minus vs lr/2r and On/in. In 9 of the 10 categories and subcategories for which diagrams have been given in the Figs 35-44 In is correlated (5 times significantly, 4 times in- dicated) with the occurrence of position preference choices (minus). Only once (Le-Me-Da-Bla, negative) In and On were equally distributed in the population of minus tests. This is in agreement with the idea that a relatively high tendency to retrieve would promote the dominance of site preference.</page><page sequence="201">188 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL In the relationship between plus/minus and lr/2r differences between categories exist. For the categories shape, Li-Me-Da-Bla (negative) and Spo^'Sp4 the relation (plus-lr; minus-2r) prevails whereas the inverse relation (plus-2r; minus-Ir) holds for the categories size, Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive) and supernormal vs normal (ns). In the other categories no relationship was found. The former three categories share the characteristic that the dummy remaining on the nest-rim after the first retrieval, usually deviated from the appearance of the natural egg without being compensated for by supernormality. This will generally have contributed to a relationship (plus-lr), and in tests where - because of position preference - the unattractive dummy was taken first to the relationship (minus-2r). In contrast, in the latter four categories the consistent majority choices were for a dummy with supernormal features; the remaining one, though less effective, was often not really unattractive, its appearance being close to normal. It is, therefore, not surprising that in these tests also the second dummy was frequently retrieved. However, this more often hap- pened in plus- than in minus-tests (plus-2r; minus-lr). Considering that in about half of the minus-tests the first dummy retrieved must have been the less attractive one, this is striking. It could be understood, however, if birds with position preference would be somewhat more frightened by the situation than birds with a consistent majority preference for the P-dummy. Then, after a gull with position preference has first retrieved the NP-dummy from the favoured site, we would expect it to be inhibited to roll in addition the P-dummy, since the supernormal features of the latter are not only attractive but also fright-inducing and since it is lying on the non-preferred site. In contrast, when a gull has first taken the P-dummy from the preferred position, the inhibition to retrieve the more normal looking NP-dummy thereafter is likely to be less. These observa- tions are suggestive of a role of a tendency to flee in the causation of position preference; the problem which motivational balance facilitates position preference shall be the subject of section 7 of this chapter. P/NP vs ST/AS. The relationship (P-ST; NP-AS) is exhibited by all main categories with supernormality. Consequently ST features in the upper cluster of the diagram concerned and AS in the lower. In the preceding section we con- cluded that ST is to be expected when the gull is not inhibited to retrieve (see Table 58). Thus the position of ST in these categories confirms our</page><page sequence="202">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 189 conclusion that to prefer dummies with supernormal characters the bird should not be afraid. The occurrence of AS in a test we have interpreted as an indication that the bird is moderately hesistant to retrieve, not because of a low tendency to incubate but because the escape tendency has been aroused. Consequently, this motivational factor must be relatively stronger in the lower clusters of the supernormality categories, comprising the NP- and minus-choices and in the upper clusters (with the P- and plus-choices) of those categories in which the gull prefers better resemblance, such as the category shape. If for the population with supernormality plus- and minus-tests are separately considered (see Fig. 49 for category size), the relation (P-ST; NP-AS) only remains significant for the minus-tests. We can understand this by assuming that the presence of the NP-dummy on the favoured site tends to lead more often to AS - the conflict between dummy preference and site preference causing hesitation. In contrast, the presence of the P-dummy on the preferred site would more often lead to ST, thus to a quick decision. In the population of minus-tests each of the dummies lies about equally often on the preferred nest-rim site. A reason why the relation (P-ST; NP-AS) is not significant for the population of plus-tests of size, is pro- bably that ST occurs in quick responses correlated with consistent choices for P as well as in very slow responses (see Table 58) correlating with con- sistent NP-choices. In categories where supernormality is not or less strongly involved the relation (P-ST; NP-AS) was not found (Figs 35, 41, 42, 44). A tendency towards reversal of this relationship (P-AS; NP-ST) was indicated but could nowhere be called statistically significant. This suggests that quick response does not promote choices for egg resemblance. Thus, in tests concerning supernormality gulls retrieving after ST are more likely to scorefor P, whereas hesitation promotes choicesfor naturalistic eggfeatures. These conclusions, based on the position of the bird on the nest prior to retriev- ing, are identical to those drawn from the data on latency. Plus/Minus vs ST/AS. A significant relationship between the degree of consistency of dummy choices and the posture of the gull shortly before retrieval did not show up in any of the categories or sub-categories considered. Only for three categories in which supernormality was involved, viz. colour, speckling (total) and speckling (supernormal vs normal) the relationship (plus-ST; minus-AS) was indicated.</page><page sequence="203">190 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL P/NP vs c/ Q. Since males were found to be on the average less easily scared than females and are likely to have a lower mean tendency to incubate (Table 58), the featuring ofo , in combination with ST, in the upper cluster of the diagrams of the categories size, colour, supernormal vs normal, and Spo0^Sp4, supports the idea that to prefer dummies with supernormal features gulls should have a low tendency to escape, and a tendency to retrieve (or incubate) which is not too high. Only in one diagram, that for Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive), where because of the supernormal features in- volved we would have expected c to feature in the upper cluster, we found 9 instead (Fig. 43). In categories where the P-dummy is the more egg-like one we would expect 9 in the upper cluster, because of the greater cautiousness of females. This was indeed found for the category shape (Fig. 35), but not for the sub-category normal vs subnormal (Fig. 42). The upper cluster also contained 9 in the sub-categories Li-Me-Da-Bla (total and negative) (Figs 41, 43), in which the P-dummy was often, but not always, closer to the appearance of the natural egg than the other dummy of the pair. As always when considering our results on speckling we have to realize that this category comprises a heterogeneous collection of experiments, which is only partially reduced after the subdivision practiced. Often more than one feature were simultaneously tested in the same experi- ment. As mentioned in chapter 5, in particular with respect to the Li-Me- Da-Bla series, we found indications that birds were weighing different criteria against each other. The results of the three Li-Me-Da-Bla sub- categories suggest that females are better in this weighing than males, probably in combination with more hesitation before making a decision, even when retrieving P after ST in the Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive) category (Fig. 43). The significant relationships of 9 with ST, 2r and NP, and of c with the complementary modes, may probably be attributed to the fact that in many of these tests the subnormal dummy was unspeckled. Since plain coloured dummies are unattractive to the birds, a relatively high motivation is required for such dummies to be retrieved. The threshold level was apparently more often reached in females than in males. Our data reveal some other relationships which can be attributed to differences in the average motivation of males and females during the tests. First, the relation (9-AS; o'-ST) is significant in all categories or sub-categories in which P-choices are based on resemblance, or otherwise are likely to result from a more careful weighing of the feature shape: Li-</page><page sequence="204">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 191 Me-Da-Bla (total and negative patterns), see Table 49, row 14. The alternative relationship (9-ST; c-AS) was indicated, but never signifi- cant, in categories with supernormality: size, speckling (total and super- normal vs normal) and Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive). We suggest that a dum- my with supernormal features on the nest-rim more often scared a female, and kept it from settling, than a male. Second, the relationship (ST-On; AS-in) is over all tests much stronger in 99 (X2 = 88.2) than in males (X2 = 7.9). This is in accord with the impression that females tend to be more easily influenced by the external situation on the nest than males and that their responsiveness to the incubation situation would on the average be higher. Third, the strong relationship (P-ST; NP-AS), which in Fig. 49 was shown to hold for the population of minus-tests in which supernormality was involved and which was attributed to (NP-AS), after further splitting of the data turned out to be only signifi- cant for all tests with females (XQ = 17.57) and not for males (X2r = 0.93). This again fits the idea that females are more inclined than males to weigh different aspects of the test-situation and are less eager to retrieve supernormal objects. Summarizing, the data on P/NP, O/9 and ST/AS are consistent with the view that females have on the average a higher tendency to incubate than males, but are more likely to be frightened by disturbance in the familiar external situation. Thus males score more oftenfor P thanfemales when supernormality is concerned in the choice, because they are less scared by the strong conspicuous features and through their lower retrieval tendency, are more discriminative. In contrast, when the choice is based on resemblance to the natural egg, the cautiousness of thefemale and her greater inclination to settle and incubate promoting a careful weighing of the features - makes her more often score for P, especially when her tendency to incubate is not too high. Plus/Minus vs c'/Q. The two types of relationships possible between these classes were both found: (plus-cy; minus-9) occur in the categories size, colour (ns), Spo0%Sp4 (ns), normal vs subnormal (ns) and Li-Me-Da-Bla (positive); (plus-9; minus-c') in the categories shape, Li-Me-Da-Bla (total, positive and negative). This suggests a linkage between (plus-o'; minus-9) and decisions on the basis of the strength of the various stimuli present (thus also on super- normality) on the one hand, and between (plus-9; minus-o') and deci- sions on the basis of resemblance to the naturalistic appearance of the dummy on the other. This is in agreement with the idea that the former</page><page sequence="205">192 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL type of choices have to be made quickly by birds which are not scared, whereas the latter type of decisions demands a more time consuming evaluation. In addition to the relations of P/NP and plus/minus with each of the other four binary classes, the mutual relationships between the latter also contribute to the constellations given in Figs 35-44. They will be discuss- ed in the following. Interrelations between lr/2r, On/In, ST/AS, cO/Q. The relationships of the binary classes 1 r/2r, On/1 n, ST/AS and o/ 9 with each other show an amount of variation between the different categories which is not directly dependent on the choice (P/NP and plus/minus), but nevertheless demands explanation. The pertinent data are assembled in Fig. 48. Only for C/9 some of these data have already been discussed above. Fig. 48 starts (a) with the relationships established or suggested by tests in which two similar eggs or egg-shaped dummies were placed on the nest-rim (Fig. 34). We have called these the 'intrinsic' relationships. Of these the relationships (ST-On; AS-ln) and (ST-2r; AS-lr) are very dominant. Only in two sub-categories, supernormal vs normal (g) and Li-Me-Da-Bla (negative) (c), the former relationship was not significant; the latter not in Spo0'Sp4 (f). More variations between the categories oc- cur in those relationships which are statistically weak in Fig. 48a; viz. the relations between On/In and lr/2r and between o'/9 and the other binary classes. If the relationship between n and r would only be determined via feed- back from the clutch in the nest-bowl, the form (On-2r; ln-lr) should prevail. Reversal of this relationship, thus (On-lr; ln-2r), could result from a low tendency to incubate and/or a high escape tendency (On-lr), as well as from a high tendency to incubate and/or a low tendency to escape (ln-2r). The strength of these tendencies can be due to different internal and external factors, including the features of the dummies presented. Such a reversal of the 'intrinsic' relationship, when compar- ing one category with another, must thus be attributed to a shift in the pattern of distribution of different motivational states over the popula- tions of P- and NP-, or plus- and minus-tests. As can easily be seen in Fig. 48, Li-Me-Da-Bla (negative) (c), Spo',Sp4 (f), supernormal vs nor- mal speckling (g), size (j), and shape (k) are the categories showing a reversal of the intrinsic relationship (On-2r; ln-lr).

In the fieldwork we used to abandon birds who consistently had failed to discriminate between particular types of feature. The exclusion of birds irresponsive to shape differences will have favoured (On-lr) with (ln-2r) as a consequence. A similar reasoning applies for tests of the subcategory Li-Me-Da-Bla (negative). In the other cases of (On-lr; ln-2r), viz. f, g and j, supernormality is involved. The first retrieval of supernormal dummies appeared to depend on absence of inhibition to roll, a motiva- tional state likely to be characterized by (ln-2r), with (On-lr) as an obligate counterpart. Moreover, in the categories size and supernormal vs normal (ln-2r) must have been promoted because the non-preferred dummy was often similar to the standard model, and in the category shape because the abnormally shaped dummy had a larger maximum projection. The sub-categories normal vs subnormal (e), colour (i), and Li-Me- Da-Bla (positive) (d) are to be expected in the (On-2r; In-lr) group, because the probability of the non-preferred (mostly unattractive) dum- my to be retrieved in the second place is low. Table 60 shows that in fact, for all categories with the intrinsic relationship (On-2r; In-lr) taken together, the percentage of tests in which the non-preferred dummy was subsequently retrieved was significantly lower than for all tests in the (On-1r; ln-2r) goup. The relations of o/9 with ST/AS and with lr/2r should, because of the dominance of the intrinsic relationship (ST-2r; AS-lr), be considered for these three binary classes in combination. Fig. 48 shows that (0c-ST-2r; 9-AS-lr) occurs in four categories (b, c, i, k) and (Q-ST-2r; cU-AS-lr) in four (d, e, g, h) other categories. On the whole in the latter categories the NP-dummy will less often have deviated strongly from the appearance of the normal egg than in the former ones; mostly only the speckling pattern was less optimal. Therefore, we are inclined to think that in the categories (d, e, g, h) retrieval was less often inhibited in the females by the appearance of the dummy than in the categories (b, c, i, k). This would result in the linkage of 9 with 2r and ST. When in the former categories the females more often hesitated, settled first and only retriev- ed one dummy, the combination oa with Ir and AS was promoted. The greater sensitivity of the females to the appearance of the dummies also follows from the diagrams on the category shape in Fig. 49. They show that females are less often inclined to retrieve a second dummy after first taking the P-dummy than males; in the minus-test they also retrieved significantly more often after AS than after ST.</page><page sequence="208">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 195 We are of opinion that from this discussion of the direct relationships between AS/ST, On/in, lr/2r and t/ 9 it may be concluded that the variation found between different categories can be fitted into the causal network we have developed for the ways the modes of the binary classes cluster in the diagrams. However, they do not render independent support to this explanation. Plus vs Minus, P vs NP. Finally, some information can be extracted from comparing populations of only plus- and of only minus-tests, as well as of only P- and of only NP- tests, for categories of experiments in which choices for supernormality prevail and in which egg-resemblance is favoured. We have preferred to use for this comparison the most homogeneous representation of these two groups of categories, those for size and for shape. (Figs 49 and 50). The grouping of the classes again aims at the smallest possible number of connections between clusters. Despite the reduction of the number of significant relationships as a consequence of splitting up the data, some interesting observations can be made. First, from the diagrams in Fig. 49 it is apparent that more cor- respondence is displayed between the plus- and minus-diagrams of size on the one hand and of shape on the other, than between the plus- or the minus-diagrams of the two categories. For size ST features in the upper and AS in the lower cluster of the diagram of the populations of plus- as well as of minus-tests (Fig. 49a and c). For shape the inverse situation holds (Figs 49b and d). We consider this correspondence as an argument that there is more overlap in the causal factors involved in determining the choice between plus and minus than between supernormality and resemblance. The P-constellation for shape in Fig. 50b is similar to those for the populations of all tests (Fig. 35) and all plus-tests (Fig. 49) in which an egg-shaped and an abnormally shaped dummy were simultaneously presented. It confirms our earlier conclusion that consistent first choices for the correct shape (resemblance) are favoured by a motivational state indicated by AS, On, ir and 9, thus by a moderate tendency to incubate, a relatively low tendency to retrieve and cautiousness. In 11.3. we have seen that consistent preferences for the abnormally shaped dummy occur in birds (especially males) positively responding to the larger maximal projection of the sharp edged dummies. This is reflected in the upper cluster of NP-choices in tests for shape (Fig. 50d). The presence of o, ST and 2r in this cluster argues for a relatively low level of fear favouring these plus-choices; 2r will also be favoured by the relatively attractive</page><page sequence="209">196 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL size shape + 0 + STr ---- On) OnL ( On @ \ (2r) r 2r AS , , in ) I I ST )(in S O ir ir P P AS i-- n ST (3) Fig. 49.

Since the upper cluster in Fig. 50d actually reflects the motivation of birds preferring larger size, it is not surprising that it resembles the up- per cluster of P-choices in the size-category (Fig. 50a). The only dif- ference is that in the latter o0 and 9 are connected with both clusters, each of them through one relation only. This ambiguity in the position of 0 and 9 was earlier found in diagrams of categories and sub-categories in which supernormality played a role (Figs 36-44); for all size data taken together the relationships (oa-plus; 9-minus) and (o-ln; 9-On) are strongly significant. These relationships are probably chiefly due to the higher incubation tendency of the female promoting both position preference and settling on an empty nest (see section 7). In the upper cluster of the NP-diagram for size (Fig. 50c) the motiva- tion leading to consistent choices for the smaller dummy of a pair should be reflected. In II.2.4.a. we have concluded that such choices depend on a low tendency to retrieve, strongly influenced by high fear. This fits the facts that in Fig. 50c 1 r and AS occupy the positions of 2r and ST in Fig. 50a, while AS, expressing the inhibition to retrieve, is no longer cor- related with In and thus has become more independent of the situation in the nest-pit. In summary we concludefrom this section that on the basis of the correlations of choices for the generally preferred dummy (P) and the generally non-preferred dummy (NP) with modes of the binary classes distinguished, one can discriminate between a constellation of relationships characteristic for choices in which preference for super- normality and in which preferencefor resemblance prevails. In both casesfirst choices for the preferred dummy are related to a relatively low tendency to retrieve, to which the tendencies to incubate and toflee may both contribute. In thefirst choicesfor better resemblance, however, the tendency to escape is relatively strong - and in the preferences for supernormality low. A strong increase of the escape tendency may lead to consistent preferences for the generally non-preferred dummy. the consistent minori- ty choices. Non-consistent minority choices are mainly due to position-preference.</page><page sequence="211">198 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL size shape P P NP+) NP (ST / '-On) (AS) /On 2r) ----- Fig. 50.

The incidence of interruptive behaviour in relation to the modes of the binary classes In Part I (2.C.) a theory was developed explaining how interactions be- tween the incubation and the escape tendencies may lead to interruptive behaviour. On the basis of the model one would expect the lowest in- cidence of this behaviour in tests with a low interference of the escape tendency, thus tests characterized by the modes 2r, In, ST and 0. This opens the possibility to check our interpretation of the modes of the binary classes, independently of the reasoning followed in the preceding section, through comparison with the incidence and composition of inter- ruptive behaviour in the tests of the different categories. This will be done in the present section. In II.2.4.a., when dealing with the principal category size only, the relative frequencies of re-settling, building and preening have been used as indicators for the motivational balance of the bird during the tests, in particular of a conflict between the tendencies to incubate and to leave. The percentage of choices for the larger dummy of a pair was found to be greater for the population of tests without than with interruptive behaviour. The group of tests with consistent preference for the smaller dummy was correlated with a relatively low value of the building/ preening coefficient (B/P), thus with a proportionally higher incidence of preening. With the model from Part I, this low B/P value can be interpreted as an indication that a relatively high tendency to leave the nest is conflicting with the tendency to incubate when the bird is making its choice. We shall verify in this section whether similar correlations can be found in the data of the other categories. In tests of the categories shape, colour and speckling interruptive behaviour, when present, usually occurred less often than in tests of the size-category. This difference must be due to the tactile discomfort caus- ed by oversized dummies. For this reason a more detailed analysis of the occurrence of the interruptive behaviour in the different phases of the test period, such as was carried through for the size-category (2.4.a.), could not be undertaken for the other three principal categories. It was assum- ed that - as found for size - for these categories also the most suitable criterion for the incidence of interruptive behaviour would be whether such behaviour did or did not occur anywhere in the course of a test. In Table 61 the percentage of tests in which interruptive behaviour oc- curs, also specified for re-settling and for building, preening or both in combination, and the B/P quotients, are given for groups of tests</page><page sequence="213">200 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL TABLE 61.

The most consistent picture is given by the B/P quotient, undoubtedly because it concerns a proportional in- stead of an absolute measure and thus is less vulnerable to differences between tests in the absolute levels of the tendencies. For all principal categories this quotient is lower for Ir than for 2r, lower for On than for In, and lower for AS than for ST. This means that there was relatively more preening in tests with Ir, On and AS than in tests with 2r, In and</page><page sequence="214">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 201 ST, indicating a stronger influence of a tendency to escape in tests in which the former than in which the latter three modes were scored. This is in agreement with the conclusion drawn above on the basis of latency values. Furthermore, for all principal categories the percentages of tests with interruptive behaviour - irrespective of the type, as well as separately for re-settling and for building and/or preening - was higher for AS than for ST. This also indicates a higher degree of conflict between incubating and leaving in AS- than in ST-tests. Since the latency values gave reason also to assume a higher degree of conflict in ir than in 2r tests one would except more interruptive behaviour in the former than in the latter population. However, the table shows the reverse to be true; except for building and preening in the principal category colour, the incidence of interruptive behaviour tended to be consistently lower when only one dummy was retrieved. We can think of a couple of explanations for this phenomenon. First, as stated in Part I, p. 269, retrieval has priority over the other activities which may be shown during nest disturbance. Conse- quently, as long as the second dummy is lying on the nest-rim and the bird is hesitating to retrieve it, (as shown by repeated intention movements of retrieval), the interruptive activities are suppressed. Se- cond, in a number of tests Ir occurs when the tendency to incubate is low and in such cases a strong conflict with a tendency to leave is not possible. The data on the percentage of tests with interruptive activities for On and In appear inconsistent. Those for size are highest for On, but those for shape for In; in the other categories differences were practically ab- sent. It is possible that in the size series the birds were mainly influenced by the deficiency of the feedback from the clutch which was more often greatest in the On situation, and in the colour series by the presence of an unattractive dummy left on the nest-rim, a situation particularly occur- ring in the In situation. But these interpretations remain speculative. Females showed more interruptive behaviour of any kind than males, and in the size- and colour-categories their B/P ratio was lower. This should mean that a conflict between incubation and escape more often occurs in females. Such is in full agreement with the other indications, reported above, that the threshold for escape tends to be lower in females than in males and that females tend to have a higher incubation tendency than males. For shape, however, the B/P-quotient is possibly higher for females than for males. This might be due to a combination of the facts that the tendency to incubate tends to be stronger in females and the ap- pearance of the dummies of this category was less frightening than for</page><page sequence="215">202 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL colour and size. We have no explanation for the absence of this relation- ship between sex and B/P ratio in the category speckling. The B/P ratios in the population of tests with first choices for the generally preferred dummy P are in the categories size and colour higher than those in which NP was retrieved first. For these categories the population of tests without position-preference (+) also had higher B/P ratios than that of the position-preference tests (-). This is all in agreement with the conclu- sion reached earlier that for preference of supernormal stimuli a relatively low level of fear is important. On the other hand preference for better resemblance was found to be promoted by an activated escape tendency. This corresponds with the fact that in the category shape the lower B/P ratios were found for P (egg-shaped) and (+), whereas the higher B/P ratios went with NP and (-). For the category speckling the trend of the B/P ratios is similar to that for shape. This we find not surprising, since in the experiments of this category - as stated before - resemblance was often involved and sometimes difficult to separate from supernor- mality. The data on the percentage of tests with building and/or preening, with re-settling and with any kind of interruptive behaviour do not show differences for the ( + ) and (-) groups. For the P and NP groups the few significant differences found point to a higher incidence of interruptive behaviour when the NP dummy was taken first; for shape a weak tenden- cy in the other direction is suggested. These indications are all in line with our conclusions concerning the B/P ratio. Summarizing we feel justified to state that this survey of the incidence of interruptive behaviour, in groups of tests specified for all modes of the binary classes and each of the four principal categories, is in accordance with the interpretation given to these modes in the foregoing section. For the modes Ir, On, AS, Q and NP, which were taken to indicate an interfering in- fluence of the tendency to escape, the value of the BIP-quotient was lower than for the opposite modes; for AS, 9 and NP the incidence of interruptive behaviour was higher. 7. The motivation favouring position preference choices Since we have found that the occurrence of consistent majority and minority dummy preference choices are promoted by different motiva- tional states in the gull, the obvious question further to be asked is whether position preference is also related to particular absolute and/or relative ranges of the balance between the tendencies to incubate and to flee.</page><page sequence="216">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 203 In II.2.4.b. we have tried to answer this question with regard to the ex- periments on size. In the present section we shall investigate to what ex- tent the picture derived from our data on size is supported by the data ob- tained for the other categories. For the category size the following conclusions were reached: 1. The mean to-latencies for position preference tests were intermediate between the mean to-latencies for consistent preferences for the bigger and for the smaller dummy (Tables 16, 26). The mean ti-latencies for the population of minus tests was lower than that for all plus tests (Table 17). 2. With increase of the to- latency the percentage first choices for the big- ger dummy decreased (and thus for s-choices increased) in the popula- tion of plus-tests, whereas it remained about constant in the popula- tion of minus-tests (Table 27). 3. Interruptive behaviour (B, P, B + P) occurred in 242 of all 650 plus- choices for b (37%), in 261 of all 656 minus-choices (40%), and in 78 of all 173 plus-choices for s (45%). The percentages of these tests in which the interruptive behaviour included preening were 25% (60 out of 242 tests) for b (plus), 38% (98 out of 261 tests) for b + s (minus) and 58% (45 out of 78 tests) for s (plus). 4. The B/P quotient had a higher value in plus-choices (3.0) than in minus-choices (2.2) in which the bigger dummy was first retrieved; conversely it was lower in plus-choices (0.7) than in minus-choices (1.4) for the smaller dummy of a pair (Table 22b). 5. In the size series the percentage position preference choices was higher for females (61%) than for males (39%) (X2 test, p&lt;0.05). The striking phenomenon in points 1-4 is the intermediate position of the values of the motivational indicators for tests with position preference, viz. between plus-choices for b and plus-choices for s. This position suggests that the motivation causing position preference is in a way intermediate to the ranges of the motivational state favouring consis- tent majority and consistent minority choices. Since the latter was found to occur when the escape tendency is relatively high and the former when the tendency to incubate is moderate to low, a moderate tendency to escape, a high tendency to incubate, or also a combination of both, could be expected to promote the occurrence of position preference. In the principal categories shape, colour and speckling no significant differences were found between the mean to-latencies of populations of consistent majority and consistent minority choices. However, the greater diversity of the dummies used in these categories, as compared</page><page sequence="217">204 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL with the category size, and the consequently lower numbers in popula- tions of tests from which averages could be calculated, may well have prevented the disclosure of such differences. For the tl-latencies (AS + ST) two significant differences were found. The averages of those for colour were for consistent minority choices larger than for consistent majority choices (1.07 vs 0.96; Wilcoxon-test, p&lt;0.02), just as found for size. For shape a difference existed in the inverse sense (0.75 vs 1.59; Wilcoxon-test, p&lt;0.01), which was to be expected from the opposite course of the t\ (AS)-curves for colour (or size) and shape. For colour and for shape the means for position preference had intermediate values (1.04 and 1.13, respectively) which, however, did not differ significantly from either of the two other means. Thus, the scanty evidence that can be derived from these data is in accord with the idea that the motivation of position preference choices is intermediate between that of consistent ma- jority and minority choices. The latency-curves for position preference (PP) tests, given in Figs 25-32, show in most cases courses which are opposite to those for all choices for the generally preferred dummy (DP) in a category. This con- firms the idea that the motivation of DP-and PP-choices is different. Since in these curves no differentiation is made between majority and minority choices these curves are not suited for answering the question as to the nature of the motivational difference. However, it clearly follows from these curves that the relationship between the occurrence of position preference and time is strongly dependent on the features of the dummies presented. In cases in which the generally preferred dummy combined moderately supernormal features with considerable deviation from the natural ap- pearance of the egg [Fig. 26, yellow; Fig. 29b, Spo0'Sp4; Fig. 30b, Li- Me-Da-Bla-positive; Figs 31 and 32, to(AS) and to(ST) curves for colour and speckling] the latency characteristics were the same for the popula- tions of DP and PP tests. It has been suggested above (p. 115 and 130) that this might have been due to the use of a different criterion by a bird in different tests. For instance, simultaneous presentation of a yellow and a blue dummy, may at one time induce a bird with a relatively high tendency to retrieve to choose for the more effective colour and at another time to decide on position preference, possibly under the influence of dif- ferences in the extent to which it is frightened. It appears therefore that the trends of the latency curve for position preference can be interpretated in accordance with the hypothesis that a relatively high tendency to incubate and a moderate tendency to flee</page><page sequence="218">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 205 favour position preference. We shall now review to what extent the rela- tions of plus/minus with the binary classes discussed above in section 5 can contribute to this interpretation. The relationship (minus-ln; plus-On), prevailing in nearly all categories, argues for a relatively high tendency to retrieve to be involved in position preference. This relationship between position preference and the number of dummies retrieved (lr/2r) was found chiefly to depend on the characteristics of the dummy remaining on the nest-rim after a retrieval decided on preferred position. In categories involving a choice in which one dummy can be considered supernormal, the relationship (minus-lr) prevailed, otherwise (minus-2r). This points to an influence of the tendency to escape, in interaction with a moderate to high incubation tendency. With regard to the posture of the bird on the nest before retrieving the first dummy, only AS was sometimes found to be correlated with position preference and then in categories in which supernormality was involved. This supports our idea that fright plays a role in cases of position preference and that in such cases the tendency to incubate is unlikely to be low. The relationship (minus-9; plus-Co) was found for categories and sub- categories in which dummies with supernormal features were presented, the relationship (minus-O'; plus-9) when the decision could only be based on resemblance to the features of the real egg. This is to be expected when females are on the one hand more eager to retrieve than males but on the other hand more easily scared by aberrant features of the dum- mies. Most of the diagrams discussed so far are based on a mixed population of plus- and minus-tests. In contrast Fig. 49 allows a comparison of the diagrams for the categories size and shape for plus and minus tests separately. A discussion of these diagrams seems worthwhile, although the number of reliable relationships is lower as a result of subdividing the data. When considering Fig. 49 it is important to keep in mind that 70-80% of the plus tests consists of P-choices, whereas in the minus-tests P and NP are about equally represented. For size and shape the constellations of the binary classes are the same for plus and minus; for minus, however, the number of significant rela- tionships is lower than for plus. One difference between the plus and minus diagrams for size is the greater number (4) of relationships of lr/2r with other classes in size (plus), compared with only one in size (minus),</page><page sequence="219">206 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL (P-lr; NP-2r) which is not present in size (plus). Other differences are the disappearance of (P-On; NP- n) and (9-ST; cy-AS) in size (minus) and the emergence of (P-ST; NP-AS) in this population of tests. The reduction of the relationships with 1 r/2r is consistent with the idea that the chance of position preference occurring would rise with the tendency to retrieve. If as a result of position preference the NP dummy is taken first the high retrieval tendency will, in combination with the fact that the more attractive dummy of the pair is still lying on the nest-rim, promote the relationship (NP-2r), with (P-lr) as its counterpart. Since plus-choices for the smaller dummy of a pair only occur when the bird is strongly inhibited to retrieve, the relationship (NP-2r) is not found for size (plus). The disappearance of (P-On; NP-ln) in size (minus) can also be inter- preted as due to an increase of the retrieval tendency, which made removal of the egg from the nest-bowl unnecessary. The relationship (P-ST; NP-AS) in size (minus) could be conceived as the result of a relatively high tendency to settle (incubate), especially when the NP dummy is lying on the preferred position and is thus likely to cause an in- ternal conflict in the bird. A striking difference between the plus and minus diagrams for shape is the disappearance of the relationships of P/NP with On/l n and with c/ 9, thus with two indicators for motivation. The only relation of P/NP left (NP-2r; P-lr) is likely to be caused in the same way as suggested for size (minus). It is, however, very weak; X2: p&lt;0.10, as compared with p&lt;0.001 for shape (plus). The appearance of a significant relationship (9-AS; cy-ST) in shape (minus) can be understood if in this population of tests not only the incubation tendency was on the average higher than in plus tests, but the escape tendency also. Then the more easily frightened 9 9 would be slightly more inclined to settle before retrieval than the O0Uc and also be more often scared by the abnormally shaped dummy, even when lying on the preferred site. In shape (plus) and size (minus) 0 and Q are about equally associated with AS and ST, but in size (plus) the relationship is the reverse of that in shape (minus). Thus, in tests for shape 99 showing AS and/or Oyo showing ST are more likely to decide on the basis of position than on dummy preference, whereas in tests for size 99 showing ST and OOy showing AS are likely to make a consistent dummy preference choice. This choice can be either for P or NP, as is illustrated by the absence of a relationship between co/9 and P/NP in size (plus). Above (11.6.3. and 4.) we have concluded that the motivational states favouring consistent ma-</page><page sequence="220">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 207 jority and consistent minority choices are different, but mainly regarding the strength of the tendency to escape, whereas the tendency to incubate should be relatively low for both. In the plus choices for shape P is significantly related with indicators of a relatively low tendency to retrieve (On and Ir) and with 9, whereas NP is connected with In, 2r and sex. The absence of a relation between oc/9 and AS/ST could be interpreted as an indication that the relationship of the sexes with the dummy preferred is mainly due to a difference in the tendency to flee between oa and 9, at least partly in reaction to the aber- rant appearance of the abnormally shaped dummy. As explained in II.2.3.a. and 11.3. the NP-choices in shape (plus) are in fact preferences for the larger maximum projection of the block shaped dummies. Since after retrieval of the abnormally shaped egg the remaining one has a naturalistic appearance its chances of being in addition retrieved are high; this accounts for the relationships of ' and NP with 2r in shape (plus). Fig. 49 finally shows that for each of the categories the constellations for plus and minus seem to be essentially the same, although the number of significant relationships supporting the constellations is for minus much smaller. In contrast, between size and shape a qualitative dif- ference occurs: the positions of AS and ST. We are inclined to consider the resemblance of a to c and b to d in Fig. 49 as an indication that choices with dummy preference and choices with position preference in the same category are the result of a gradual quantitative shift in the motivational state. Our conclusion that a combination of a moderate to high tendency to incubate with a moderate tendency to escape would promote position preference choices, raises the question how a motivational state compos- ed of a high tendency to incubate and a low tendency to escape would af- fect the decisions. Since this is the classical situation for threshold lower- ing (LORENZ, 1937a, b) one would expect the bird to become increasingly indiscriminative when its tendency to retrieve is rising. It is likely that this threshold lowering would earlier become evident with respect to dif- ferences between dummies than with regard to a strongly developed posi- tion preference habit. In that case position preference would be caused by an increase of the incubation (retrieval) tendency only. Since one would expect the discrimination between dummies to decline gradually with such an increase, first for smaller and only later for larger differences, the phenomenon demonstrated in II.2.3a that position preference can usual- ly be broken by increasing the difference between the dummies, can also</page><page sequence="221">208 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL be understood in this way. The occurrence of random choice, however, to be expected at the lowest threshold level, we have never been able to demonstrate. Although we sometimes did have the impression that a bird was choosing randomly in a few successive tests, another mode of deci- sion making soon became apparent when the series of tests was con- tinued. It is not unlikely that our 'chess-playing technique' counteracted the occurrence of random retrieval. Moreover, birds remaining irrespon- sive to dummy differences after several pilot tests were abandoned. In this way we have probably selected in our population of tests against cases of birds in which a high incubation tendency went together with very little or no fright. On the other hand, as far as such cases are present among our data, they must have interfered with our attempts to derive from our measurements one single description of a motivational state typical for position preference. This may be the reason that with respect to position preference the picture given by these data is less conclusive than that for the difference between consistent majority and consistent minority choices. We think that our conclusion should be that the occurrence of a choice-dominating position preference is promoted by a motivational state reducing the effectiveness of elements of the stimulus situation presented. This could be the effect of an increase of the tendency to incubate as well as of a moderate increase of a tendency to escape. The resulting effect would probably be relatively stable when both tendencies are activated and in balance for some time. As will be shown in chapter IV.2.b. the preference for particular sites of the nest-rim is due to conditioning processes. Its weight in decision making varies between birds and in the same bird between periods. As dealt with in II.2.3a the strength of the habit at a certain instance can be measured by sorting out which MP-ratio between the two dummies is needed to break the site tenacity. This strength is usually constant during a couple of hours but may increase or decrease in the course of a series. This could be due to changes in the tendencies involved. However, in- crease can also be promoted by reinforcing the habit through presenting more often the most effective dummy on the preferred site. By presenting this dummy more often on the non-preferred site the habit can be weakened. In contrast, position preference may also increase in the course of a series, in spite of efforts to prevent this. We found this particularly when working with 'difficult' dummies, e.g. those of the Li-Me-Da- Bla series or the less attractive colours. In this we are inclined to attribute the apparent increase of position preference to a reduction of the effec- tiveness of dummy features, perhaps through a decrease of attention for</page><page sequence="222">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 209 dummy differences, which might be the result of repeated presentation of unnatural features. We shall come back to this idea in chapter V.4 of the general discussion. 8. Conclusion The results of our study of the effectiveness of different egg-features for releasing and/or directing the retrieval response, reported in the preceding chapters of this Section, showed the remarkable phenomenon that, whereas in the category shape resemblance with the real egg was preferred in the majority of tests, in the principal categories size and col- our a preference for a limited number of particular features determined the choice. Increase of the physical intensity of those features, even beyond values occurring in the real egg, raised their effectiveness in releasing and/or directing incubation responses (supernormality). With respect to dummies of the principal category speckling, decisions based on the presence of particular features in the dummies as well as on resemblance to the natural egg were both found. When gulls consistently preferred one dummy of a particular pair over the other, their preference usually agreed with that of other gulls and was also the same in tests at different times in the incubation season (consistent majority preferences). Sometimes, however, a gull temporarily deviated for some time con- sistently from the predominating preference, thus exhibiting a minority preference. Beside these consistent dummy choices, tests frequently oc- curred in which the choice of the first dummy taken was not determined by preference for one of the dummies but by a tenacity in retrieving first from a particular place on the nest-rim (position preference). As external factors could not account for temporary shifts from consistent dummy preference to position preference or consistent minority preference, such temporal differences of preference must be attributed to internal factors. The primary purpose of the analysis dealt with in the present chapter was to disclose the nature of these motivational factors. It turned out in addi- tion that these factors are also important as determinants of the criterion (effectiveness of single features versus resemblance to real egg) the gull is going to apply. To assess the motivational state during different types of tests three types of indicators have been used: latency, the so called binary classes, and the incidence of interruptive behaviour, particularly the building/preening quotient.</page><page sequence="223">210 BAERENDS &amp; VODEGEL The analysis of latency data, in particular of tl (AS), i.e. the time passing between arrival on the nest and retrieval of the first dummy when the gull settled in this period, revealed that the consistent majority choices for dummies with supernormal features tend to correlate with short and those for dummies resembling real eggs with longer latency values. Accordingly, consistent minority choices in tests in which one of the dummies presented bore supernormal features and the other did not, thus preferences for better resemblance, were also found correlated with long latencies. In contrast consistent minority tests in the category shape tended to have short latencies; this is understandable since in these choices the preference for larger size, thus for supernormality, was found to be involved, the abnormally shaped dummies having a somewhat larger maximum projection than the egg-shaped ones. We may therefore conclude that a distinct relationship existed between the length of the latency period and the criterion upon which the first choice was made. The motivation promoting consistent majority choices for supernormali- ty was characterized by short latencies, the motivation leading to consis- tent minority choices for supernormality and consistent majority choices for resemblance, by longer latency values. The data on the 'binary classes' [position of the bird before retrieving (ST, AS), the number of eggs retrieved (1 r, 2r), the number of eggs in the nest bowl at the start of the test (On, In), the sex of the gull] and the ratio of building and preening in the tests support the conclusion from the latency data that the variation in the preferences observed can be inter- preted on the basis of a shift between a motivation characterized by a high and one expressed by a low tendency to retrieve. It is argued that the tendency to retrieve is subordinate to the tendency to incubate and that its expression is determined in interaction with the strength of a simultaneously present tendency to escape from the experimental situa- tion at the nest, or to avoid it. Several arguments have been given that position preference is pro- moted by a moderate to high activation of the incubation system and a moderate tendency to escape, in combination or alone, because both tend to reduce the effectiveness of dummy features, be it in different ways (a high N through threshold lowering, a moderate E through avoidance of strong stimuli). As a result position preference tends to take place at a motivational state intermediate between the balance favouring preference for supernormality and that promoting decisions for correct resemblance of the natural object. Consequently, it depends on the degree to which a tendency to escape is counteracting the tendency to in-</page><page sequence="224">INFLUENCE OF MOTIVATION ON DECISION 211 cubate whether the bird reacts to the dummies on the nest-rim with a perceptual mechanism sensitive to the naturalistic appearance of an egg or to the intensity of particular physical stimuli, such as light of medium wavelength, size of the projection on the retina, or abundance, contrast and smallness of speckles. Stimuli of the second type seemed to have a stronger impact than those of the first type; less tests were necessary for showing that the gulls were sensitive to them, since position preference was more readily overcome. In the General Discussion a model of infor- mation processing will be proposed by which the observed phenomena might be understood. The consequence of these properties of the infor- mation processing mechanism will also be considered. The patterns of relationship existing within the various indicators used (latencies, binary classes, interruptive behaviour) as well as between these indicators and the type of decisions made (plus P, plus NP, and minus, for supernormality and resemblance) show that the interference of a tendency to escape with the incubation system not only influences the afferent aspect of information processing but also several efferent aspects of the behaviour during incubation. We are of the opinion that the data presented in this chapter on the variations in these aspects among our tests can be satisfactorily interpreted on the basis of interaction between two antagonistic behaviour systems, which can be simultaneously ac- tivated, each independently of the other over a range of levels. This model corresponds to the hypothesis that a hierarchical structure is underlying the behavioural organization, in which, however, an element of lower order may be under control of more than one system. Our data on the behaviour during incubation do not contain indications that more than two interacting systems are involved.</page><page sequence="225">CHAPTER 7 THE PROCESSING OF HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION OF EGG FEATURES INDUCING THE RETRIEVAL RESPONSE by G. P. BAERENDS, G. J. BLOKZIJL andJ. P. KRUIJT 1. Introduction In this chapter an attempt will be made to unravel a part of the procedure by which the bird, after reception of the different features of the egg (or egg-dummy) by the sensory organs, evaluates the object before making its decision with regard to the retrieval response. In the preceding chapters various stimuli were found to be effective. For some of them, such as a green groundcolour or a contrasting speck- ling pattern, the effectiveness could more easily be demonstrated than for others, such as the typical egg-shape. The former features appeared to be valued more strongly than the latter; they were more likely to overrule the existing position preference and consequently a lower number of tests was needed to attain a reliable difference between the number of first retrievals of a dummy bearing such a character and another one lacking it. In the present chapter we shall try to delimit the relative effectiveness of the different features distinguished more exactly. For this purpose we shall now exploit the phenomenon of position preference, which in the ex- periments of the preceding chapters only had been a nuisance. We shall use position preferences as a means for calibrating the effectiveness of the various features with reference to the size series (Plate V). Next, the question will be asked whether the effectiveness of different features interact and if so how. For the first time this question was asked by SEITZ (1940) when studying the effects of different components of display behaviour in cichlid fish on an adversary. He came to the conclu- sion that the components of a complex stimulus situation act in- dependently of each other and that the frequency and intensity of the response is determined by summation of the effects of all stimuli present. This phenomenon has become known as the 'rule of heterogeneous sum- mation' (Reizsummenphenomen). In the following we want to check the validity of this rule for the information processing underlying the egg retrieval response of the herring gull.</page><page sequence="226">PROCESSING OF HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION 213 2. Methods As shown in II.2.3.a, position preference is a quantitative phenomenon. A tendency to take first the dummy which is lying on the preferred site, even if it is smaller, can always be overcome by increasing the size of the dummy on the non-preferred position. By means of the dummies of the graduated size series one can identify stepwise, in successive tests with the same bird, the minimum size of a dummy required to break a position preference occurring when this dummy is presented in competition with a particular dummy of smaller size in the preferred position. When through this 'titration' a dummy is found the value of which, in combination with the value of the non-preferred site, just outweighs the combined values of the smaller dummy and the preferred site, the strength of the position preference can be expressed with reference to the dummies of the size series. The relative effectiveness of each of a pair of size dummies for eliciting retrieval was found to be cor- related with the ratio of their maximum projections (MPR; see II.2.3.a). Thus the strength of a particular position preference can be expressed as an MPR-value inter- polated between the value just able to break the position preference and the one just fail- ing to do so. This is illustrated in Fig. 51 (row a). Any pair of dummies with the same ratio can be used to break a particular position preference. The ratio between the values of two positions may remain constant for a couple of hours. In such a period the procedure can also be used to measure the effect of any kind of dummy in which different features are represented and combined in one of various dif- ferent ways. Fig. 51 (row b) gives as an example the measurement of the effect of dummy X. In such a series it has to be checked repeatedly whether the position preference has re- 8 8 8 7 9 7 10 7 11 12 12 11 r= 1 r=1.3 r=1.5 r = 2.3 r =0.8 r=1.3 8 7 x 7 12 11 x 8 10 8 8 7 r=1.3 x&gt;8 r=1.3 x&lt;10 r=1.7 r=1.3 Fig. 51.

This preference remains when dummy 8 is replaced by the smaller dummy 7, but can then be overcome by replacing in the third test dummy 8 by 9; this sequence shows that the value of the position preference lies between r = 1.3 and r = 1.5 and this conclusion holds when another pair of dummies with the same ratio is used in the 6th test. As a control the 5th test shows that the size optimum for this gull exceeds size 11. b) Determination of the value of model X. The 1st, 3rd and 6th test show that the position preference has remain- ed unchanged. The 2nd and 4th test indicate, in combination with the preceding and suc- ceeding tests, that the value of X is between those of the models 8 and 10 of the reference series.</page><page sequence="227">214 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; KRUIJT mained unaltered; this should preferably be done with different pairs of dummies to avoid possible conditioning to a particular model. Because position preference tends to increase when testing is continued several hours during a sitting spell and one measurement of a dummy takes at least 5 consecutive tests (Fig. 51, b), for these measurements the test period cannot last as long as 20 min. Fortunately we could find birds, especially during the second half of the incubation period, which were so little scared by our experimental procedure that they continued accepting the confrontation with a new pair of dummies on the nest, about every 6 min after they had made a choice. With such birds one complete measurement could be obtained within one hour and up to five in one sitting spell. For the sake of comparison we strove to do as many tests as possible with the same bird and dur- ing periods of constant position preference. We selected nests near the edge of a colony in order for the assistant to reach them in the shortest possible time and with as little distur- bance as feasible. Nevertheless, the number of tests we could do this way during a season was limited. In the example of Fig. 51 (b) five tests sufficed for narrowing down the value of dummy X between the code numbers 8 and 10 of the size series. Often many more tests were needed and frequently the value of the dummy was less closely delimited when the series of tests had to be discontinued - mostly because the incubating bird was relieved by its mate. In such cases at the end of a sitting spell the value of a dummy had sometimes only been approached from one side. A series especially tended to involve many tests, and thus had a greater chance of being prematurely broken off, when at its start the experimenter CODE SIZE SERIES &lt; 4 &lt; &lt; 5 &lt; &lt; 6 &lt; &lt; 7 &lt; &lt; 8 &lt; &lt; 9&lt;&lt;10&lt; &lt; 11 &lt; &lt;12&lt; &lt;14&lt; &lt;16&lt; TOTASUROFSINGSLE 0 00 0° °0 1 0 0 2 14 3 15 7 22 5 14 7 44 32 0 MEASUREMENTS CUMULATIVE 0 73 0 73 0 73 0 72 2 72 5 5812 4317 21 24 7 28 3 30 0 TOTALS 70- 60- o 50- ) - \ E 40- ) 30- higher a 20- E - 10- 0- . . . * ' * S lower 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 16 size series (code nrs) Fig. 52.

Such practical difficulties importantly restrict the amount of tests one can make and were the main cause for the spread in the measurements. To make the most of the amount of tests attainable we have developed a method of data processing which allowed us to make use of all measurements obtained, despite the dif- ferences in the number of tests we could make with each dummy. This method, which also makes it possible to cope with temporary differences in the evaluation of features of a dummy by individual birds, differences between birds, and non-systematic errors in tests, is as follows. Each series of tests which made it possible to conclude that the dummy of unknown value was rated as higher or lower than one of the eleven numbers of the size series - in- dependently of how close the value of the model seemed to have been approached - was treated as a single measurement of the dummy. As an example, in the first row of the table in the upper part of Fig. 52, the totals of all single measurements of dummy 8 GrSp are given. To obtain from these data a final assessment of the dummy value the totals of the single measurements were transcribed in a cumulative way. Thus, for all code numbers of the size series was indicated in how many measurements the dummy had appeared more and in how many less effective than that code number (second row of the table in Fig. 52). The average value of the dummy was then taken to be situated in that area of the scale, were the scores for more and for less effective approached one another most closely (underlined in table). A more precise determination of the position of the unknown dum- my with reference to the size series was finally achieved by drawing the two cumulative curves representing the scores for more and for less effective with respect to each code number, and interpolating the place of their intersection on the reference scale. The steeper these curves run near the intersection-point the more reliable the measurement is likely to be. The reliability very much depended on the opportunities we had to run a series of consecutive tests with the same bird long enough for closing in the dummy value from both sides. 3. Material Egg-shaped dummies of four sizes, viz. 5, 8, 10 and 12, were painted both in the brown and in the green groundcolour, and without as well as with black (primary) and grey (secondary) speckles. Moreover, rounded brown speckled blocks (RB) were made in the sizes 8, 10 and 12. The relative effectiveness of these dummies can in various ways be compared in series of three or four dummies in each of which only one feature is varied (either size, groundcolour or speckling) while keeping the others constant (Plate XV). 4. Results Table 62 gives the cumulative totals of the results of the measurements, as derived with the above described method from 658 tests with the 16 different dummies for which a reasonable number of measurements was obtained. To facilitate comparison of the final results, for each dummy the Figs 53 and 54 have been constructed. The former diagram, primari- ly meant as a pictorial survey of the experiments done, roughly indicates the average relative positions found for the various modifications. The latter diagram gives a more accurate representation of the positions found for each of these dummies and is therefore more suitable for com- parison.</page><page sequence="229">TABLE 62.

The diagrams show for sets of similar dummies of three different sizes how much difference it makes in the average effec- tiveness of a dummy for inducing the retrieval response when: a) the egg-shape is exchanged for the block shape; b) the speckles are omitted; c) the plain brown groundcolour is exchanged for a plain green one; d) speckles are added to this plain green groundcolour. If the information processing mechanism involved would compute the value of each feature distinguished independently of the value of other features, an identical change applied to dummies of different size should cause the values of these dummies to shift over equal distances on the reference scale. This means that when in Fig. 54 lines would be drawn between dummies of the size series and equally sized dummies of the series a, b, c and d, corresponding sets of lines should run parallel.

To try out which alternative is most likely to be fulfilled in Fig. 54 a set of parallel lines has been constructed for each of the four categories of modified dummies. The direction chosen for each set is the one which fits best to the computed average position of all dummies in that set. In view of the crudeness of our method for the assessment of the dum- my values it is not surprising that deviations occur between the average positions of the dummies actually established and the position indicated by the parallel lines. It is, however, most important that these deviations do not reveal any systematic trend; their amount as well as their direction seem to be randomly distributed.

Larger deviations were more fre- quent for positions of low than of high reliability. Nowhere the deviations amounted to more than half the distance between successive dummies of the R-series. We conclude from Fig. 54 that our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the effects of groundcolour, shape and the presence of spots are independent of the size of the dummy concerned. A further question is whether the first three characters mentioned are also mutually independent. Considerably more experiments and tests would be necessary for answering this question properly. However, some answer can be deduced from the data in Fig. 54. First, a change of shape was measured in rounded block-shaped brown-speckled (8 BrSpRB) and green-speckled (8 GrSpRB) dummies. In both cases the downward shift with respect to the corresponding egg- shaped dummies (8 BrSp and 8 GrSp) was of the order of 0.08 on the log scale. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of independence. Second, the diagram offers the possibility for comparing the effect of speckling on a brown with that on a green background. Using the ideal position indicated by the parallel lines (and thus basing our comparison on measurements of dummies of different sizes) we find a value of 0.11 between plain brown and speckled brown dummies. Between plain green and speckled green dummies the difference is greater, it amounts to 0.19 on the scale. Clearly, this result does not support the hypothesis that the values of the different features would be computed independently of each other. However, it cannot be used as an argument against this hypothesis either. Since green appears to the gulls (as well as to us) considerably brighter than brown (see V.2.) the speckling pattern on green dummies has a more effective contrast than on brown ones. Spots on green dum- mies are therefore not equal to those on brown ones; they are better. This probably explains the difference found. Beside the dummies discussed so far, the position of two other, normal- ly sized, dummies (8 BlSp and sup 8 Gy) were measured. They are also indicated in Fig. 54. For the blue speckled egg-shaped dummy a position was found above code 8 of the size series, as was to be expected from the greater contrast of the speckles on the blue background, but far below 8 GrSp, with its supernormally effective green. The position of the densely speckled normally shaped and normally sized dummy with light-grey background (sup 8 Gy) was found to lie out- side the range of the reference scale and could only be assessed by ex- trapolation of the cumulative measurements curves mentioned above.</page><page sequence="233">220 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; KRUIJT The assessment of the dummies as indicated in Fig. 54 are averages, obtained by pooling data from different individuals and/or from different sitting spells, often on different days. In the preceding chapters we have seen that the motivation of the bird at the moment it is deciding which dummy to take first can influence the choice made. In 11.4.3. evidence was given that, when frightened, a bird may prefer a brown colour over the generally highly effective green. In this respect, an extensive series of measurements we managed to do with one individual (0o 4908) on 4 dif- ferent days, is interesting. The results are presented in Fig. 55; they all concern the measurement of plain green dummies of two sizes.

On 10/6 and on 11/6 they also held the same position with regards to the reference scale and this did not appreciably differ from the average position derived from the total population of measurements on all gulls (compare Fig. 53). On 9/6, however, the green groundcolour appeared to have an extraordinarily high effect and on 13/6 an exceptionally low on n ece e. We think we can ex- plain the latter case: when on 13/6 o 4908 was confronted with its first test situation that day a fighter plane roared over the gullery just at the</page><page sequence="234">PROCESSING OF HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION 221 moment the gull touched the green dummy with its bill. The gull was ob- viously scared and immediately flew up. Although the test series could be resumed the bird appeared reluctant to roll the green dummies and re- mained so during the rest of the sitting spell. The gull seemed to have become conditioned to avoiding green. The cause for the high value of green on 9/6 we can only guess. On this day the gull was for the first time confronted with green dummies, perhaps a novelty effect may have caus- ed an increased attention for green. 5. Discussion Our data, as represented in Fig. 54 agree with one of the statements of the rule of heterogeneous summation, viz. that different modalities of in- formation are each being processed on the basis of their own quantitative representation, independently of the values of the others. The second statement of this still hypothetical rule says that the information derived from different modalities is finally summated. The data which made SEITZ (1940) postulate this rule were unsuitable to decide which mathematical process is actually involved in this summation and this author obviously did not intend to do so. Besides addition, multiplication seems to be a possible candidate. The parallel lines in Fig. 54 seem to reveal a process of addition, but as this figure was designed on a logarithmic reference scale, our data could be considered to argue for multiplication as the process through which the different kinds of infor- mation are combined into a final output. However, for really solving this problem more refined and greater numbers of measurements would be needed. In chapter 7 of the General Discussion (Section V) we shall come back to the problem of how various types of information are integrated and how the final decision is made. We shall then consider the applicability to our results of models proposed by other authors. In the beginning of this chapter we suggested that some categories of features present in our dummies seemed to be more effective than others in inducing incubation responses in the gulls. In II.2.3.b we found a slight increase in size to overrule the suppressive effect of abnormal length-width proportion. Further Fig. 54 shows that changing egg-shape for block-shape had the smallest effect of all changes applied. Consider- ing that the block-shape was more deviant than any of the other shapes tried, the conclusion that generally shape is a relatively unimportant feature for inducing incubation responses seems justified.</page><page sequence="235">222 BAERENDS, BLOKZIJL &amp; KRUIJT A comparison of the relative effectiveness of other categories of features as such is not practicable, since in each of the principal categories, colour, speckling and size, the effectiveness varies over a wide range depending on the qualitative and quantitative representation of the category. Only for shape no indications for the existence of such wide ranges were found. As shown in 11.6. the preferences of the gulls for strongly effective stimuli - such as a green colour, a strongly contrasting pattern of small speckles, or enlarged size - peak at another motivational state than pro- nounced preferences for egg-shape. The latter are favoured by a tenden- cy to escape. The fact that most of the tests were done with birds ac- customed to our procedure, and thus with a low tendency to escape, probably accounts for the relatively low effectiveness of shape features found in our experiments. Gulls showing distinct signs of fear were more inclined to prefer dummies of natural shape, size, colouration or speckl- ing pattern; they were much more responsive to detailed features of the eggs than boldly reacting birds. In the former motivational state birds were obviously making use of memorized knowledge acquired from ex- perience with their eggs; in the latter state they strongly responded to stimuli the effectiveness of which could not possibly have been derived from experience with the natural object. The results of the experiments on heterogeneous summation given in this chapter - for instance the values found for block-shaped eggs of different size - show that both types of information are combined in determining the final choice. The dominance of the effectiveness of some features over others, as well as the dependence of the effectiveness of a feature on quantitative aspects, open the possibility to apply and at the same time to test the 'rule' of heterogeneous summation in attempts to make artificial stimulus situations, which considerably deviate from the adequate natural ones but are nevertheless more effective. Such situations can really be called 'supernormal'. Most, if not all, of the supernormal situations constructed so far surpassed the standardized reference dummy but not the natural egg (see V.6.). The super-speckled, light-grey, egg-shaped dummy of normal size was more effective than the largest dummy of the size series. Given in com- petition with a real egg, however, sup 8 Gy was taken first in only 18% of all tests in which the pair was presented (Table 63, Plate XIV). Chang- ing the groundcolour into green, raised this figure with 7% only. In- crease of the size of the dummy turned out to be more powerful, but a normally speckled brown dummy of the enlarged size 12 did not turn out to be more effective than a real egg.

In tests not dominated by position preference (plus-tests) this latter dummy was always taken first (Plate XIV). Thus, combination of powerful features: enlarged size, a high density of fine, contrasting speckles and a green groundcolour shifted the preference from the real egg towards a dummy to which it hardly bore any resemblance. Obviously, in the causation of the increased respon- siveness to supernormal situations the procedure of heterogeneous sum- mation plays a paramount role. 6. Conclusion The total or composite value of an object on the nest-rim for releasing and/or directing the retrieval response is determined through integration of the component values of the different features present in the object. The value of each feature is independent of that of other features. Thus, the rule of heterogeneous summation applies, provided 'summation' is not taken to imply addition, multiplication being a more likely candidate. Features preferred on the basis of supernormality and features prefer- red because of resemblance to the natural egg appeared to be equally sub- ject to the summation procedure. By combining several supernormal features in one object its effec- tiveness could be made to surpass the value of a real egg.</page><page sequence="238">SECTION III THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT EGG- FEATURES IN RESPONSES OTHER THAN EGG RETRIEVAL by G. P. BAERENDS* CHAPTER I OTHER INCUBATION RESPONSES In 11.1.2. the arguments have been given for our choice of the egg- retrieval response as the criterion for egg-recognition in our study of stimulus selection. Yet, for a further understanding of the mechanism of information processing and decision making, it is important to know to what extent the procedures effective in releasing and/or directing egg- retrieval are also involved in other kind of responses towards eggs. To ex- plore the possibility that in such cases the same or a different evaluation procedure would be followed a limited amount of tests have been carried out that were designed for using either settling or nest-attendance, or cannibalistic egg-robbing as a criterion for relative effectiveness of the egg- or dummy-features. 1. Settling on clutch The effectiveness of different dummies in inducing settling in herring gulls was tested by presenting the incubating bird simultaneously with two different clutches, in two different nests within the bird's territory near to the original nest-site. For this purpose a pair of sufficiently ident- ical intact but deserted nests of other gulls were carefully loosened from the ground and placed close to the nest of the bird to be tested, the nearest points of their peripheries circa 35 cm apart. The original nest was taken away and its traces wiped out or, if necessary because of strong site tenacity of the bird, covered with some buckthorn branches.

BAERENDS dummies, mostly in clutches of three, but sometimes in clutches of two, were placed in both nests. To check the influence of position preference for each pair of dummy clutches the two positions were repeatedly ex- changed. A considerable difficulty in carrying out these tests results from a strong tendency in the herring gull to rely on landmarks for relocating its nest. The structure of the nest and its content appear mainly important in the final stage of orientation (see IV.3. and Table 64a). Consequently clutch choice tests with displaced nests were only feasible with gulls nesting in rather wide bare and flat areas with a low homogenous vegeta- TABLE 64.

Even then some gulls persisted in returning to the original nest-site, most likely guided by distant landmarks. When the bird accepted the displaced nests it usually soon developed a preference for one of them, as a consequence of which the number of tests with each bird had to be severely restricted. This position preference seems to be caused by dif- ferences in the degree to which each of the nests satisfies the stimulus con- stellation the bird is expecting in the consummatory situation, thus while incubating. Details of the nest-structure or its content and of its situation with respect to landmarks are of importance here. These factors, as well as the sight of another clutch nearby, may in the choice tests repeatedly induce the bird to rise and shift position, and not infrequently to move to the other nest. We decided to use only the first settling on a clutch (or nest) as a criterion for the effectiveness of a particular visual stimulus situation. In the first place clutches of real eggs were presented in competition with clutches of standard dummies (8 BrSp). As shown in Table 64b the effectiveness of the real eggs proved to be far superior to that of the dum- mies in evoking settling.</page><page sequence="240">OTHER RESPONSES 227 TABLE 65.

P. BAERENDS Furthermore, for each of the principal stimulus categories, shape, speckling, colour and size, a limited number of clutch choice tests was carried through. The results are presented in the Tables 65, 66 and 67. The data in Table 65a comprise the results of tests in which different types of abnormally shaped dummies (see Plate VII) were given as a homegeneous clutch in competition with a clutch of normal standard, thus egg-shaped, models. The result of this experiment suggests a somewhat higher effectiveness of the normal shape. Position preference frequently occurred in this series, just as in the egg-retrieval experiments in the shape-category. In the experiment on speckling only two types of dummies were used: standard colour dummies with a fairly large number of normally sized black and grey speckles and unspeckled dummies in the same ground col- our. In our opinion the data (Table 65b) convincingly show a preference to settle on the speckled clutch. The data obtained in the experiment on colour have been summarized in Table 66. In this series clutches of the five different colours described in 1.4. have been used; unfortunately the number of tests varies between the different colours. In the table the different pairs of clutches presented to the birds have been arranged in accordance with the order of effec- tiveness of the colours found in the egg-retrieval experiments (II.4.2.), and in keeping with this the a-choice is predicted to be the first one in the majority of tests. The data show that the colour preferences for settling are essentially in agreement with those for egg-retrieval. Most of the f-choices (minority choices) were due to position preference. Only the two cases of preference for red over yellow concern a consistent preference, displayed by one bird within one series of tests. This happen- ed when this bird was for the first time confronted with yellow dummies and shortly after it had been presented with a red clutch in competition with an empty nest (when an assistant forgot to place the appropriate dummies in the latter). It is not unlikely, therefore, that some condition- ing or habituation to red may have taken place here. In the experiment on size the size-dummies 12, 8 (= normal), and 6 have been used (Table 67). With the exception of one test only, the birds always went first to the clutch of larger dummies of each pair. When the clutch consisted of oversized dummies the birds proceeded beyond stooping over the clutch and shifting the dummies with the bill (in the table listed under 'intention'). However, they did not completely settle on and incubate such clutches. When clutches of normally sized dummies were given against clutches of undersized ones, in by far the majority of</page><page sequence="242">OTHER RESPONSES 229 tests first settling took place on normally sized models; the first choices for the smaller ones were all clearly due to position preference. Conclusion. We consider it justified to infer from the results of the 163 tests dealt with in the Tables 65, 66 and 67 that no indications were found that the pro- cedure of information-processing leading to the preference of a stimulus situation for settling would be different from that found for egg-retrieval. Considering that the pattern of egg-retrieval is very similar and probably identical or homologous to shifting, while the latter is a component of set- tling, this result is not surprising. 2. Nest-attendance The use of nest-attendance as a criterion for the effectiveness of various egg-features in inducing incubation responses does not imply the incor- poration of behaviour patterns different from those used above. Nest- attendance involves orientation towards the clutch, the movement of shifting or retrieving the eggs and settling. However, when we used retrieving and settling as a criterion we measured the effect on single oc- currences of each of these activities. In contrast, when attendance is measured over a period of several days the effect of repetitive confronta- tion of the stimulus situation on the entire complex of activities is assess- ed. The idea that this cumulative effect might differ from the effect on single performance came to us when, during regular inspections of a large number of nests, we noticed that none of the few albino clutches we had found (see I.A.e.) finally hatched, whereas in the same period the mortality in other complete clutches was low. Because albino clutches are very rare it was impossible to test the value of this impression statistically with real eggs; we could however, confirm it by using uniformly painted eggs (see below). We have studied the effect of a number of egg-features on nest atten- dance in two somewhat different ways: (a) by adding the dummy to an incomplete clutch, after which thus the clutch remained heterogeneous and (b) by exchanging the complete original clutch for a homogeneous clutch of one type of dummy only. a) Tests with heterogeneous clutches. A possible way of obtaining with relatively little effort a large amount of data for comparing the adequacy of different dummies as egg-substitutes</page><page sequence="243">230 G. P. BAERENDS seemed to be to exchange one of the eggs in a clutch for a dummy and to check from then on periodically during the season how well the nest had been attended. These experiments were done in the first season of our study, actually as pilot experiments before we decided on the main technique to be used. Although for that reason these experiments sometimes lack sophistica- tion, as additional information the data is of interest. The bird could be expected to be most sensitive to an exchange in the period 72-96 hours after the laying of the first egg. This follows from the findings of PALUDAN (1951) and PARSONS (1972) who have extensively studied the laying pattern of the herring gull and the mechanism by which the number of eggs in the clutch is controlled. PALUDAN found that the three eggs appear with intervals of about 48 hours and that the her- ring gull only becomes the determinate layer it was always thought to be, circa 24 hours after laying the second egg. If an egg is lost before that time the gull is able to bring a fourth follicle to full development. When egg loss results in the nest-bowl becoming empty, the nest is abandoned and the remaining part of the clutch is laid in a newly built nest, a few meters away in the territory. In practice it turned out to be difficult to carry out the exchange with certainty during the sensitive period. We therefore gave up this method after the breeding season of 1951. Nevertheless, from the pilot ex- periments we obtained some data on nest-attendance on clutches con- taining some kind of dummy, which is worth mentioning here briefly. For comparison we also ran tests in which real eggs were added to or removed from a clutch. The data is summarized in Table 68. It first (a) shows that reduction of a clutch to one egg severely jeopardizes successful incubation of that egg. This effect seems stronger when a clutch of two than when a full clutch was reduced to one egg. We could think of at least two explanations for this phenomenon: a clutch of two may already have been robbed once, indicating that its owners might be poor nest-attenders; or if the test con- cerned a clutch that still had to be completed, the high incidence of disturbance might mean that owners of fresh clutches are more inclined to leave their nest and commence a replacement elsewhere than owners of clutches in a further advanced stage. More information about the age of the nests and the behaviour of their owners would be necessary to decide between these alternatives or to postulate others. Here we only wanted to hint at some interesting questions (see also Part I, 2.1.e).</page><page sequence="244">OTHER RESPONSES 231 TABLE 68.

These data suggest an in- fluence of the number of eggs on nest-attendance and tie in with those given in Part I (p. 175, Table 26) on the predation percentage on clutches of different size. With only one exception, emptying the nest-bowl led to abandoning the nest. Addition of an egg to an incomplete clutch did not have an appreciable effect on nest disturbance; placing one or two eggs in an empty nest-bowl never induced incubation in the few cases tried (Table 68:b). The effect of adding a standard dummy to an incomplete clutch (Table 68:c) was not different from that of adding a real egg. Furthermore also for rounded dummies of abnormal size the percentage of nests disturbed was relatively low. In contrast, addition of unspeckled dummies or ab- normally coloured ones increased the egg-losses. As such models provide the same tactile feedback stimulation as standard dummies, the increased mortality can only be attributed to the visually perceived inadequacy of the nest-situation. With sharp-edged and undersized dummies visual and tactile deficiencies may each play a role.</page><page sequence="245">232 G. P. BAERENDS We tentatively conclude from the results of these pilot experiments that the repeated visual perception of an inadequate nest-situation may have a negative effect on nest-attendance. Deficiencies in colour, speckling and size seem to be of more influence than deviations in shape, similarly to what has been found in the extensive experiments on egg-retrieval. Overt reactions of the bird to strange dummies placed in the nest-bowl can often be seen. This is illustrated by the following records: June 8 1951: 11.40 One of the eggs of the clutch of nest 15 is exchangedfor a normally shaped brown speckled standard dummy. 11.42 Gull alights in the territory near the nest proceeds to it and steps into the nest-bowl, settles and incubates (11.43). 12.00 Standard dummy exchangedfor normally sized dummy with red ground colour and black speckles. 12.03 Gull alights on same place, approaches nest, stops just outside nest-rim and pecks at red dummy; walks away. 12.04 Gull approaches nest again, looks at it and walks back to roost inside territory. 12.05 Gull again proceeds towards nest, halts at nest-rim, pecks at red dummy and looks at it intensively for a long time. Steps into nest, settles and incubates quietly (12.07). 12.15 Gull rises, looks at eggs, walks away, pecks at red dummy. Partner arrives, also pecks at red dummy. 12.20 Partner settles and incubates. 12.35 Red dummy replaced by real egg. 13.17 After the gull has been sitting for 40 minutes on 3 real eggs one of these is exchangedfor a sharp edged block (SB). 13.19 Gull lands in territory, walks towards nest, stops and preens. 13.21 Gull steps into nest, looks at clutch, and steps out of nest-bowl on other side, preens. 13.23 Gull returns to nest, walks again through nest-bowl, stands on roost, picks up straw and walks towards nest again. Deposits straw on nest rim, settles and incubates. It is clear from these records that the gulls have perceived the presence of the strange dummy. It makes them hesitate and perform interruptive behaviour but they nevertheless settle on the clutch and incubate. These preliminary results made it worthwhile to undertake more systematically some series of experiments of this type. In these the entire clutch was exchanged for the dummies to be tested. b. Replacement of the entire clutch by dummies. The easiest way to assess nest-attendance is by regularly inspecting a large number of nests and determining egg loss through robbery. The robbery of painted eggs is easier to ascertain than that of dummies; whereas when real eggs are robbed the shells usually remain in or near the nest, wooden dummies are mostly carried away and are consequently more difficult to recover. This is why we decided to restrict our clutch replacement experiments to characters of speckling and groundcolour which can be varied by painting real gull eggs and omit such experiments on size and shape.</page><page sequence="246">OTHER RESPONSES 233 b. 1. Speckling. In series of tests, carried out in 1952 and 1953, the original clutches of herring gulls were exchanged for either one egg or dummy painted evenly brown without speckles, for one egg or dummy painted in the same groundcolour but also with black speckles, or for an unpainted (speckled) egg. All eggs had been vigorously shaken to kill the embryo, and had been kept cool for several days before they were used in the tests. Only in one (the first) series of tests speckled and unspeckled wooden dummies were used. The results have been given in Table 69. Nests with unspeckled eggs were far more frequently disturbed than nest with speckled ones. This could in principle be caused by poor nest-attendance as well as by poor camouflage, since both factors promote egg robbing. TABLE 69.

Some 30-50 deserted herring gull nests were collected from various places in the colony and randomly distributed at distances of about 20 m from each other in a relatively open area near the colony, scarcely occupied by gulls and with a rather homogeneous vegetation. In half of these nests one speckled egg was placed, in the other half one plain coloured egg. As none of these nests were guarded, any difference in predation on speckled and unspeckled eggs should be due to the dif- ference in pattern. In 1952 three times a series of 30 nests was run on suc- cessive days and in 1953 three times a series with 45 nests. The results are</page><page sequence="247">234 G. P. BAERENDS given in Fig. 56, separately for each year. Both in 1952 and 1953 painted eggs with and without speckles were taken at the same rate; this rate was much higher in 1952 than in 1953 because in 1952 there happened to be more specialized robbers around. A protective effect of the painted speckling pattern was not demonstrable. The low effectiveness of camouflage with respect to robbing herring gulls under these experimen- tal conditions also follows from the position of the curve for the unpainted eggs. They were even taken at a higher rate than the painted eggs in the same year. We think this is due to the hunting gulls using a detailed 'searching image' when hunting for eggs as food; as will be shown in the next chapter, they go for good resemblance and they are probably scared by unfamiliar features of potential food. Conclusion. Combining the results of the 'nest-attendance' and the 'camouflage' experiments we conclude that unspeckled eggs suffer stronger predation than speckled ones because they are less well attend- ed. In how far cryptic colouration also plays a role cannot be answered from these experiments alone. First, we have merely observed its effect on specialized and experienced, conspecific predators. Second, we did our experiments in nest situations such as these are found after the first week of incubation when the nest with its eggs has become much more conspicuous than during the early period of egg laying. Early on there is less nest material and the colour more closely resembles the background. Camouflage is likely to be most important at that period, the only time at which both parents may be away from the nest for hours (Plate XVI). b.2. Groundcolour. In 1972 we exchanged original herring gull clutches, randomly taken in the colony, for clutches of eggs painted either red, yellow, brown, green or blue (colours as given in II.4.) with black and grey speckles. The nests were situated in an area of the colony with a variable vegetation of bushes and long grass; of each colour 30 clutches were randomly distributed among the others. We inspected the nests 6 times during a period of 17 days, noting down whether the eggs were still being incubated as judged by their temperature, and the position of markings on the shell - and whether eggs had disappeared. Since the entire clutch was usually robbed soon after incubation had been discontinued the results can be interpreted as log survivorship curves for the 30 clutches of each of the 5 colours (Fig. 57). Survival was highest for the brown colour, which resembles the</page><page sequence="248">OTHER RESPONSES 235 100 1952 90 ____ /I * speckled 1 ... / 80 []F@ O unspeckledj painted eggs ~80- J unspeckled" g3$ ~ i80/~~ ^~A unpainted eggs 2 70 o60 C by Ad ^ 1953 0 50 Ca40 (:- / 30 - 2 0 1- 2 3 4 52 time, hours Fig. 56.

Green and yellow suffered equal - but higher - mortality, blue clutches disappeared at a considerably higher rate and red ones showed the steepest decline. Conclusion. The order of effectiveness found here for the various colours (brown-green and yellow-blue-red) strongly resembles the order found for egg-retrieval (green-yellow-brown-blue-red), with exception of the place of the non-spectral colour brown. The hue of the brown dummies matched the colour of the natural eggs best. Their relatively low mortali- ty is likely to have been due to two factors: 1) through their better resemblance of natural eggs the chance of scaring off their owners must have been lower; 2) the brown clutches were more cryptic than the others. Although green and yellow were found to be more stimulating than brown in our egg-retrieval experiments, their second place in the rank order of increasing mortality rate must be due to their higher frightening effect. Higher conspicuousness might have played some role, but the relatively low importance of that factor appears from the higher mortality of the blue and red dummies, the colours of which were certain- ly less conspicuous than those of the green and yellow ones. As will be seen below, red is an effective colour for evoking feeding pecks. Conse- qently the result obtained for the effect of clutch colour on continued nest-attendance is likely to be the resultant of at least four different, part- ly opposed factors; stimulation of incubation activities, activation of escape, conspicuousness and stimulation of feeding responses. The phenomenon of supernormality did not show up clearly in these ex- periments, since green and yellow were found to be inferior to brown.</page><page sequence="250">CHAPTER 2 FEEDING RESPONSES 1. Feeding responses towards eggs or egg dummies a) Introduction and methods. Herring gulls are notorious egg robbers (Plate XVI). On or close to the own nest intact eggs trigger incubation responses and are not eaten. If an egg is found further away from the nest, and certainly when it is spotted outside the territory, it is most likely to be pecked at and devoured. Would the gulls rely on the same or on different cues when feeding on eggs as when incubating them? To answer this question, in 1972 for each of the four principal stimulus categories: shape, size, colour and speck- ling an experiment was carried out to investigate to what extent these dif- ferent types of stimuli are effective in inducing feeding responses. For shape, size and speckling this was done with the same wooden models as used in the egg retrieval experiments. For testing the effect of colour we took real eggs that had been painted in the colours used in the egg-rolling experiments on colour (11.4.) and in the nest-attendance experiment (III.1.). Each of the four categories was tested in a separate experiment. The models to be simultaneously tested were laid out, either in an area between or on the borders of occupied territories, or near places where groups of gulls loafed together ('clubs'), resting and preening. In the ex- periments on shape and size 3 to 5 dummies were placed at equal distances on the circumference of a circle with diameter of 1 m, in the ex- periments on colour 5 painted eggs. In the experiment on speckling 2 dummies, one with and the other without speckles, were simultaneously presented, 40 cm apart. Unfortunately, all models of the same category were not represented in each test. The experimental situation was observed from a blind for periods of 20 minutes, after which the positions of the dummies or eggs were changed. On the same place and on the same day not more than 3 consecutive tests were made, preferably on 3 different categories. When a gull visited the situation, the order in which the different dummies present were pecked at or eaten was noted down. In case of dummies the number of pecks per dummy and the number of pecking bouts per dummy (consecutive series of pecks not interrupted by stepping or turning away from the object) were recorded.</page><page sequence="251">238 G. P. BAERENDS b) Size. In this experiment the dummies 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 were used in 35 tests. The results are summarized in Table 70. Neither the average number of pecks directed at each of the dummies, nor the numbers of times each dummy was chosen (judged by the occurrence of at least one consistent pecking bout directed at that dummy) before and after a larger sized one, show a preference for oversized eggs. The normal sized egg was most often pecked at, more often also than the undersized dummy. The first peck, however, was about equally often directed at dummy 6 than at 8; therefore we hesitate to conclude that dummy 8 was more effec- tive than dummy 6. We have no doubt that both were more effective than the oversized ones; of the dummies pecked at in the 32 tests made, the first one hit was 25 times the smallest. TABLE 70. The relative effectiveness of egg dummy size in releasing feeding response Dummy size 6 8 10 12 16 Average nr. of pecks per dummy per presentation 2.9 6.1 2.4 1.9 0.3 c) Shape. In this experiment the normal standard dummy was simultaneously presented with RB, RP and either SB, SC, SP or SD. Table 71 first gives the number of pecks aimed at each of the 5 dummy-types. The relatively high effectiveness of normal egg shape is evident from the large number of responses to the standard dummy, but it also appears from the relatively high number of responses to RP, compared with the other ab- normally shaped dummies. This must be due to the egg-shaped end of these 'prismatic' dummies, which was always presented upwards in the tests. Secondly the relative effectiveness of the different shapes is expressed in Table 71 by a figure derived from the order in which the dummies were pecked at in the course of each test. Depending on whether a dum- my was pecked at in the first, or in the second, third, fourth or fifth place it scored 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; if it was left untouched a 6 was given. The rank order of the dummies could than be determined from the sum of the scores obtained. The lower this sum the higher its place in the rank order, thus the greater its effectiveness. The two types of scores give the same</page><page sequence="252">OTHER RESPONSES 239 picture of the relative effectiveness of the dummies. In a third method of comparison the number of pecking bouts were taken into account. Four categories of bouts were distinguished: bouts with 1, with 2-5, with 6-10 and with more than 10 pecks. For each of the 5 dummy types the numbers observed of the different bout categories and the number of tests in which each model remained untouched, is given in Fig. 58. The posi- tions of the peaks of the frequency distributions of pecks at the normally shaped dummies, the prismatic dummy (RP) and the block- and cylinder-shaped dummies clearly support the ranking arrived at earlier. 18 normal shape * ~\ I~r-~ block . 16 \ rounded cylinder 0 16 \ _prism A sharp edged block o 14 c 12 co Co 10 2 0 1 2-5 6-10 &gt;10 number of pecks per visit Fig. 58.

From these data we conclude that there was no difference in the responsiveness to features of shape between incubation and feeding responses. In both cases rounded dummies were more effective than sharp edged ones and egg shape was superior to blocks, cylinders or prisms. d) Colour. In this category 51 tests were made in which all 5 groundcolours were simultaneously presented, each one on fully painted, real gull eggs and black speckled. The results have been computed in two different ways.</page><page sequence="253">240 G. P. BAERENDS TABLE 71.

The data for pecking have been represented in Fig. 59. Those for eating are not given; the frequencies are somewhat lower because not every peck was followed by eating, but no difference in trend was found. The graphs for brown, red and yellow follow an iden- tical course, decreasing from a maximum for the first choice to the lowest figures for the 4th and 5th one. In contrast, the graph for green in- creases from a low value for first choices to an almost constant level for later choices. The curve for blue follows a course intermediate between those for green on the one hand and brown, yellow and red on the other, reaching the highest values for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th choices. Thus, according to this method, the effectiveness of brown, yellow and red is highest and about equal, green shows the lowest effectiveness and the responsiveness to blue is intermediate. As a second way of presenting the data Table 72 shows how often each of the five colours was, in all tests taken together, preceded and followed by a response to another colour. Brown, red and yellow were found to have equal chances of being pecked at before or after any of the other four colours, blue is more likely to be pecked at or eaten after these colours, and green has the highest chances of being taken last. The data for brown and yellow suggest that these colours might stimulate eating; they were closest to those of the real egg and its contents. We conclude that, in contrast to the results for incubation responses, green is least effective in inducing feeding on eggs. Red, which ranked lowest in incubation, is highly effective in the feeding situation, together with brown and yellow which took up an intermediate position in the egg- rolling tests. Brown, red and yellow are colours which may occur in natural feeding situations. The brown colour used resembled that of the shell of real eggs.</page><page sequence="254">OTHER RESPONSES 241 A preference for red is likely to help a gull in getting access to the internal organs of a freshly killed vertebrate prey or not too old cadaver washed ashore. Yellow always appears when the gull breaks an egg before eating. To verify our impression that the presence of yellow yolk on the egg sur- face is a strong stimulus for releasing a peck we gave a number of gulls the choice between two real herring gull eggs, one with and one without a yellow patch painted on the shell. The yellow-patched egg was first broken and eaten in 8 of 13 cases, whereas in the other 5 cases the un- treated egg was taken first. 20 0 rMd 18 .0 bIownl e or n 16 . o.'S.- $14 ~4-~~ Fig. 59.

In this experiment two brown wooden dummies, one speckled, the other plain, were presented in competition. The speckled dummy was 27 times pecked at first, the plain dummy 28 times. From this we can only con- clude that for feeding on eggs the presence or absence of speckling makes little or no difference.</page><page sequence="255">242 G. P. BAERENDS TABLE 72.

Although the number of tests in each of these four experiments lags far behind that of the egg-retrieval experiment, and although the experimen- tal set-up was sometimes not as consistent as it should have been, we are of opinion that the data presented in this chapter suffice to make it clear that the responsiveness of gulls to eggs as feeding objects differs from that to the egg as an object for incubation. None of the stimuli effective in in- ducing feeding responses could be called supernormal. Eggs within the normal size range were preferred over oversized ones. For eating speck- led eggs were not preferred over unspeckled ones. The ranking of the spectral colours with respect to feeding (red and yellow-blue-green) was clearly different from that found for incubation responses (green-yellow- blue-red). Only for the category shape (for which in the egg-retrieval ex- periment no supernormality was found) the order of effectiveness was the same for feeding and incubating, the effectiveness increasing with im- provement of the resemblance to the shape of the real eggs. 2. Spontaneous stimulus selection in an artificial feeding situation novel to the gulls a) Methods. In the foregoing section we have seen that colours of longer wavelength were more effective in evoking feeding on eggs than colours of shorter wavelengths. To find out whether, in general, gulls in which the feeding motivation was activated would be more alert to objects reflecting light of longer wavelength, we also undertook some experiments on stimulus ef- fectiveness in a situation not found in the normal environment of the gulls; to which therefore they could not have been conditioned.</page><page sequence="256">OTHER RESPONSES 243 For this purpose we taught a number of gulls that had been kept in pens around the laboratory for periods varying from 1 to 4 years, to take food from an earthenware pot, 15 cm high and 15 cm in diameter. After the birds had acquired this habit the pot was covered with a 17 x 17 cm piece of unpainted board. Soon the gulls learned to remove this cover; usually they took it in the bill and pulled it away. This stage being reach- ed choice tests in which the gulls had to choose between one of two dif- ferently painted covers were started (Plate XVII). Two pots - partly dug in - were placed in a test pen symmetrically with respect to the 30 x 30 cm door through which a gull could enter this pen, the distances between the pots and between the pots and the gate be- ing circa 50 cm. Both pots always contained some food. One by one the gulls were introduced into the test cage, through another cage which was connected with holding pens, each containing a small group of 3-4 gulls. Having made a choice and swallowed the food the gull was induced to return to its living cage through a bypass. The gulls quickly became ac- customed to this route and could be guided without touching them. Care was taken to present each combination of colours or patterns equally often in each of the two positions and to avoid the same colour or pattern in immediately successive tests. A considerable difficulty in the design and execution of these ex- periments was that we had to avoid conditioning the gulls to stimuli prevalent in the test-situation. For we wanted to obtain information on 'spontaneous' preferences of the gull, i.e. in differences in effectiveness of various stimuli existing in the average gull hatched and raised in the natural environment. In a first series the 17 x 17 cm plywood covers were painted in one of the five colours as well as in the grey shades II, III and IV, used and described in chapter II.4. In three other series speckled patterns were given. The speckles were black, and the background identical to grey II (44% reflectance). In the first of these either large (diam. 12 mm) or small (diam. 2 mm) speckles were used in large numbers (36 speckles of 12 mm or 1160 speckles of 2 mm, both covering 12.6% of the surface of the lid) as well as in small numbers (9 speckles of 12 mm and 290 speckles of 2 mm, both covering 3.2% of the surface of the lid); in competition with each of these 4 combinations a plain coloured lid was also given in this series. The sizes of these speckles correspond to those in the egg dum- mies Spo and Sp2 described in chapter 11.5. In a second speckling series, one of these 2 dummies and the plain brown normal sized and egg-shaped dummy (BrPI) were presented in</page><page sequence="257">244 G. P. BAERENDS competition, each attached on top of the centre of a cover. In a third series only the central part of the cover was speckled (an area about equal to the projection of an egg), with either the small speckles or the large ones, both at their high densities as mentioned above. The gulls used in these experiments had been fed with pellets and chopped cooked liver. Special care had always been taken not to give them markedly structured, shaped or coloured food. Two factors made it extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory results in these experiments. First, position preference very often overruled any possible difference in effectiveness of the colours or patterns presented. TABLE 73.

The picture emerging for colour preference (Table 73) resembles that for egg-retrieving (Table 32-37, Fig. 21) and settling on the clutch (Table</page><page sequence="258">OTHER RESPONSES 245 TABLE 74.

Green tends to be more effec- tive than yellow, blue, red and the 3 shades of grey used. The latter have the lowest effectiveness; dark greys are even less effective than light ones. Brown and red however, seem to score higher than in the incubation responses, brown obtaining about the same score as green, and yellow and red being apparently superior to blue. Brown is the only colour to which the gulls might have become conditioned in respect to food, since the food pellets, the chopped liver and the unpainted covers originally us- ed for training the birds in the test situation, were brownish coloured. More tests would be necessary to establish these differences conclusively, but the relatively high effectiveness of green and brown compared with the low effectiveness of red and blue is in our opinon not open to doubt. c. Speckling. Table 74 summarizes the results obtained on the relative effectiveness of a speckling pattern, and of the number and the size of the spots, in this experimental set-up. To make the most of the restricted number of tests available the data have been lumped in the following way.

P. BAERENDS large speckling. In II.a. tests with both sizes of speckles have been lumped. The results under I are not in accordance with those on the preferences for spot features in the retrieval response. A low density of large speckles was found to be more effective than a high density of small ones and covers seemed to be more often removed first when plain than when speckled. One possibility for explaining the higher effectiveness of the plain coloured and sparsely speckled covers is to attribute them to condi- tioning to the evenly coloured surface of the board covers used during the training phase. Another possibility is that the contrast with the egg- retrieval results is due to the considerable differences between the objects in which in the two types of experiments the speckling had been painted. To explore this second possibility, we undertook the second series of experiments, in which the egg-dummies Spo, Sp2 and BrPl (pictured in Plate X) were attached to plain coloured covers. This time the results were in agreement with those of the egg-retrieval experiments; covers with speckled eggs were preferred over those with evenly coloured ones and small speckles on eggs were found more effective than large ones. Did this mean that the preference for a large number of small sized speckles would be different for three-dimensional and flat objects? We tried to answer this question by presenting in a third series of tests the gulls with the entirely flat covers on which the speckling patterns had only been applied in the centre (Plate XVII). As shown in Table 74111 the preference for many small speckles although weaker remained. These results may mean that the effect of speckles depends on the relative size of the object bearing them. It could, however, also mean that in this set-up a conditioned preference to plain covers is overruled by an (uncondition- ed) preference for speckling as found effective in egg-retrieval. Anyway the data obtained lend no support to the idea that the relatively high ef- fectiveness of speckling patterns hold with respect to eggs only. Clearly, much more and better designed experimental work would be necessary to give conclusive answers to the questions raised here. In spite of this we decided to discontinue the experiments at this stage, partly because of the extremely high incidence of position preference already mentioned, partly because of the technical difficulties connected with the prevention of conditioning processes that might interfere with the aim of measuring 'spontaneous' preferences. Pilot experiments for developing better methods, free of these disturbing interferences, have been started, in particular with Skinner box techniques.</page><page sequence="260">SECTION IV THE INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCUBATION RESPONSES by J. P. KRUIJT and G. P. BAERENDS 1. Introduction In the foregoing chapters the nature of the information necessary for the performance of incubation behaviour and the way it is processed in the gull were analyzed. Questions about the origin of this information were so far left untouched. This was the consequence of the way the problem was primarily posed: the analysis of an innate releasing mechanism. The term 'innate' in the LoRENzian sense stands for 'not derived from ex- perience with the adequate object'. This connotation was primarily meant to exclude information obtained through imitation and through trial and error manipulation of the adequate object, with or without the influence of social facilitation. With the use of the term innate in this sense LORENZ wanted to emphasize that for the behaviour of animals (the form of their motor patterns as well as their selective sensitivity for exter- nal stimulation) similar rules of genetic control apply as for their mor- phological features. LORENZ propagated this term in reaction to the ex- treme WATsoNian point of view in 'behaviourism', according to which behaviour above the integration level of the reflex would be entirely due to conditioning. After LORENZ had been heavily criticized by LEHRMAN (1953) and others for supporting in this way a false dichotomy between innate and learned behaviour (nature versus nurture) and in so doing, for suppressing the development of research on the ontogeny of behaviour, he clarified his view on several occasions (e.g. LORENZ, 1961, 1965, 1969, 1978). He argued that information about 'how to respond to what' could come into the possession of the animal in three principally different ways: 1) through encoding in the genes by the process of adaptive selection of mutations, 2) through trial and error learning of the individual, 3) through information transmitted by other members of the species (imita- tion, tradition, culture). For certain purposes this division is certainly useful. One should, however, realize that in category 1 the question, how</page><page sequence="261">248 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS information stored in genes is decoded during the development of an in- dividual carrying these genes, is entirely left open. Research on the on- togeny of species specific behaviour has shown that learning processes, somehow programmed by the genes, can be involved. Consequently category 2 and even category 3 are not excluded by category 1 and neither is category 2 excluded by category 3. Experimentally, category 3 can be rather easily separated from 1 and 2 by isolating the animal from conspecifics. When under such conditions the trait appears in its normal form, one is only allowed to conclude that possibility 3 is not involved. However, if the experimental animal fails to develop the trait this can be due to effects of isolation other than the absence of the example. Similarly one may be able to demonstrate that a trait can be present in an animal to whom exposure with the adequate object or any other object had always been denied. Failure to develop a trait, however, may always be due to hidden causes other than those investigated. In category 1 a role of learning through experience with external stimulation other than that from the adequate object in the ultimate func- tional situation can never be exhaustively excluded. The amount of links conceivable in a programme controlled by genes depends on the imagina- tion of the investigator. Thus, although LORENZ' three categories may be useful for some general purposes, it is impossible to strictly separate them. The demonstration of absolute absence of influences of experience in a trait is impossible. In contrast the potential for accumulating information through learn- ing somewhere in a trait can be demonstrated by successful attempts to introduce experimentally information which is functionally false and does not correspond with the natural trait. It is mainly in this way that we have investigated the role of learning processes in some aspects of incuba- tion behaviour. 2. Topographical orientation It is obvious that learning is important in becoming familiar with a par- ticular breeding area. GOETHE (1937) and TINBERGEN (1953) have reported evidence that herring gulls tend to return to the same colony and often occupy the same territory in successive years. Even the nests were sometimes made at exactly the same site as in a preceding year, despite the fact that the nest structures were destroyed by weather factors in winter. This suggests that the gulls learn the bearing of the nest with regard to (optical) beacons.</page><page sequence="262">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 249 TINBERGEN also reported that a high percentage of the chicks return to their home colony when they have reached the breeding age. Tradition, including individual learning (categories 3 and 2), must be involved here. It is not unlikely that such learning processes may cause a family tradi- tion to breed in a special vegetation or landscape type in the colony and in this way contribute to the correlation which appeared to exist between the groundcolour of clutches and the overall colour of the vegetation sur- rounding the nest (I.3.B.). We know from the behaviour of gulls kept under controlled conditions in the laboratory that naive birds pick up nest material and handle it in an apparently suitable way. It is, however, not unlikely that gulls learn from other gulls where to go for nest material, just as they follow each other when going for food. However, we have not tried to collect data on the influence of learning from conspecifics on incubation behaviour of the gulls. Only as a byproduct of our experiments, we have obtained some insight in the kind of information individual gulls acquire with respect to the nest and its surroundings. a) Localization of the nest-site. Some indications about the way in which herring gulls relocate their nest we obtained when, in the beginning of this study, we tried simultaneous presentation of two different dummy clutches as an alternative technique for studying egg-recognition (11.1.2. and III.1.1.). For this purpose we removed a gull nest, wiped out its traces, and placed two intact deserted nests just beside the original site, their centres circa 70 cm apart. Often the birds before deciding for one of the dummy clutches sat down on the original nest-site, despite the absence of nest or eggs. This shows that even when nest structures are present close to the nest the gulls tend to rely primarily on other landmarks. The behaviour of the birds under these experimental circumstances is illustrated by the following record of gull 0C 37, June 9, 1958. Original nest structure taken away (pit still visible). Two alien nest structures placed at 1 m distance left and right of the original one. The former nest contains three speckled dummies with brown ground- colour, in the latter the groundcolour is blue. 13.35 Gull lands in territory, walks to original nest-site, utters alarm call and returns to roost. 13.40 Gull again approaches nests, looks at both clutches, returns to roost, preens. 13.43 Gull approaches nest with brown dummies, utters alarm calls, preens. Walks to other nest, steps into it, shifts eggs. 13.50 Gull rises, walks to original nest-site, preens.</page><page sequence="263">250 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS 13.54 Gull approaches nest with brown clutch, pokes bill in between eggs, then walks to other nest. Looks briefly at eggs and goes to original nest-site, preens. 13.57 Gull walks to brown clutch, than to the nest with blue dummies and finally goes to the original nest-site. Settles on the bare pit. 14.07 Bird on original nest-site. 14.08 Bird rises, alarm in colony, assistant approaching. The relative importance of the nest-site came out particularly clearly in a pilot experiment carried out with a single pair of gulls. In all tests of this experiment the birds had to choose between a nest placed on the original nest-site, exchanged for the own nest-structure, and two other identical but alien nest-structures about 30 cm away from it. In each test one of the nest-bowls was left empty, the others contained either 3 real or 3 standard dummy eggs. The data (Table 75) show that the nest on the original site was more frequently preferred, irrespective of its content. Settling-down on an empty nest - which happens relatively seldom (see Part I, p. 164) - only occurred on the original nest-site. The presence of eggs and dum- mies in the nest-bowl could induce a bird to settle on the displaced site; real gull eggs did this somewhat more often than dummies, but both did it in a much higher number of tests when present in a nest on the original than on a faked nest-site. We have never seen a gull settling on a nest placed outside a radius of 50 cm from the centre of the original nest-site when the nest-bowl was empty, and only rarely when it contained eggs. Thus only in a small minority of cases the presence of eggs (or egg-like objects) did counteract somewhat the dominating effect of beacons. This only happened in flat, homogeneous areas where the only available beacons were far away from the nest-site. When bushes or grass tufts were near, displacement ex- periments proved to be impossible. GOETHE (1937) did several experiments on the effectiveness of poten- tial beacons (grass tufts, wooden poles, crates, etc.) for nest-orientation in herring gulls. Most of the birds clearly reacted to displacement of such objects, hesitating on their return and showing signs of alarm. Never- theless they managed to relocate their nests, most likely by means of other and more distant landmarks which had not been displaced. A preference for beacons over nest-structure for localizing the exact nest-site may be more adaptive, the denser the colony. In our working areas the distance between nests of different pairs always exceeded the distance over which we displaced the nests in the experiments manifold, but very high densities of herring gull colonies have been reported from other areas.</page><page sequence="264">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 251 TABLE 75.

Experiments in which two displaced nests were used, while sitting on the original site had been made impossible, revealed a distinct preference of real eggs over dummies. Clearly the gulls were able to distinguish the real objects from our imitations. However, we never succeeded in demonstrating that herring gulls in this experimental set-up - and only in a few cases in egg-retrieval tests (IV.3.a.) - manage (or care) to distinguish their own clutch from alien clutches. In contrast, black- headed gulls, which normally nest in much greater densities than herring gulls, are indeed able to make this distinction (BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975). From these observations we conclude that the gulls use landmarks for finding the exact site of their nest within their territory. The presence of eggs probably mainly confirms their decision. It is obvious that this orientation involves learning processes and, in case of site-constancy over years, the capacity to memorize details about the landscape for long periods. NOBLE &amp; LEHRMAN (1940) and TSCHANZ (1972) have for the laughing gull and the black-headed gull, respectively, tried to weigh the relative importance of the nest-site, the nest-structure and the clutch in relocating the nest. TSCHANZ presented these three components singly or in different combinations at a distance of 1 m from each other. He found that site and nest- structure were more important than the eggs when the nest was first</page><page sequence="265">252 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS identified from the air. When walking towards the nest the 3 components were of about equal value and for settling the presence of eggs was the most important cue. This is in agreement with the findings of NOBLE and LEHRMAN that, within the nest area, the importance for the release of the settling response increased in the order: nest-structure- site-clutch. TSCHANZ (pers. comm.) found the black-headed gull to be able to distinguish between its own eggs and alien clutches, and between its own nest-structure and alien nests when the nest material had a characteristic colour or shape. b) Orientation on the nest; causes for site preference. In Part I, p. 178 experimental evidence has been given showing that wind direction is a factor determining the orientation of incubating gulls on the nest. The birds prefer to sit facing into the wind, but in case of conflict between different preferences they make compromises. In the ex- periments involved the (dummy) eggs had been pegged into the nest- bowl and the gulls had to compromise between the tendency to hold an egg in each of the three brood patches (two in front and one in the rear) and the tendency to face the wind. Normally the eggs are free and can be moved about with bill and feet before the gull settles down in the position chosen; thus under natural conditions the position in which the eggs hap- pen to be lying is unlikely to have an important influence on the orienta- tion of the incubating bird. Probably the most important factor interfering with the preference for facing into the wind is the topographical situation around the nest. This becomes obvious when comparing the amount of divergence in the orien- tation of birds sitting in flat areas with low vegetation with that of birds nesting on slopes of small dunes and in areas with high grass and bushes. In such irregular landscapes the orientation is much more varied. Sometimes branches or dense grass tufts close to the nest made it impossi- ble for a bird to sit comfortably in certain directions. Often we had the impression that such obstacles, also when further away from the nest, in- fluenced the orientation of the bird if they interfered with their view in the distance. Especially when slightly alarmed, incubating birds may scan the horizon intensively. The (micro-)topography around the nest also strongly influences the route taken by the birds in approaching the nest. Usually one to three trails lead through the vegetation from the roost in the territory towards the nest, the length varying from a few to over ten meters. Even in areas with low vegetation preferred pathways were common. Individuals</page><page sequence="266">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 253 develop strong preferences for one particular path over the others, and the members of a pair could often be quickly recognized because of their different habits in approaching the nest. These habits comprise the speed at which the birds cover different stretches of the path, the places where they halt to look around, etc. We suspected that the direction from which the nest was approached influenced the orientation of subsequent sitting on the nest. Indeed often the gulls were sitting in prolongation of the last stretch of the usually curving path to the nest. A 31: 28 B 0 0 C Fig. 60a.

A 62 0o o Fig. 60b. Interaction of the localisation of the nest entrance and the position of the egg pair on the nest rim in determining the primary orientation of the bird on the nest. For each of the 6 sectors and for three positions of the eggs (A, B and C) the figures give the number of times a bird oriented itself in that sector immediately after entering the nest. With this in mind our co-worker W. A. CASPARIE did an experiment in which he investigated in combination the role of the topography at the end of the path (nest-entrance) and of the site of the nest-rim on which the objects for retrieval had been placed, on the orientation of the gull just after entering. In each test 2 similar eggs or egg dummies were plac- ed on the nest rim (the pointed pole of the one at 21/2 cm distance from the rounded pole of the other) either to the left (B) or to the right (C) side</page><page sequence="267">254 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS of the entrance through which the bird was expected to step on the nest, or opposite to it (A). The first position taken up by the bird, while stand- ing in ST-tests or while sitting in AS-tests was assessed by the observer in the hide. Tests in which the bird entered through another entrance, or where the orientation of the bird could not be properly estimated (as in several rapidly proceeding ST-tests), were discarded. The results are presented in Fig. 60b. In this figure are indicated the 6 sectors of the nest to which each orientation of the bird was referred. The figures give the number of first orientations of the birds in all tests of each of the three categories, the hatched sector comprises the orientations most frequently chosen. The data reveal a strong inclination to orient in the direction the nest was entered. The birds always followed this rule in the A-situation, thus when the position of the eggs coincided with the preferred orienta- tion. However, in the B- and C-situations they compromised, deviating to the left or the right, respectively, but never choosing for the rim-eggs alone. In 7 AS-tests the orientation of the birds compromised in a direc- tion away from the eggs on the nest-rim. In 5 of these (71 %) no retrieval took place. This happened only in 6 of the 114 tests in which birds first settled (AS) either in line with the entrance or heading towards the eggs (52%). Our data on egg retrieval contain many other cases in which we had the impression that birds settled facing away from dummies they were not going to retrieve; they apparently 'cut off' (CHANCE, 1962) the stimuli emanating from them. Several times they also covered such dum- mies with nest-material, building sideways in a hindward direction, sometimes repeatedly with intervals in between, which suggests that they had not forgotten the dummies. The results of these experiments con- firmed our earlier impression from the retrieval test that the birds visually take in the entire nest situation before deciding how to behave next. The further proceedings of CASPARIE'S test show a relation between orientation of the bird and preference for the site from which the first egg will be taken. This is demonstrated in Fig. 60a which summarizes how often in the A-, B- and C-position the birds first retrieved the egg to the left or that to the right of their head. It is clear that the birds were biassed to retrieving the egg nearest to their head after they had taken position on the nest. If the bird settled in front of the eggs (A) the number of first choices for left and right were equal. The number of tests per bird in the B- or C-situation was too small to answer the next question coming up, viz. whether individual gulls might have the habit to retrieve first consistently either from the left or from the right side. To answer this question we have analyzed all sequences of two or more position preference tests present in our entire material. In this</page><page sequence="268">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 255 data the first choice was in 277 series directed to the left and 255 series to the right, 169 different gulls were involved. Of 88 of these gulls two or more series of tests were available, separated by at least one long parental shift by their mates, but usually also made on different days. Retrieval from one side only occurred in 14 of these birds (7 consistently took the left dummy first and 7 always the right one). However, for 8 of these birds the position of the dummies was equal in all sequences of position preference tests recorded, 5 birds had the dummies presented in two dif- ferent positions and 1 bird in three; per bird 2-4 series were involved. These data make it clear that preference to retrieve from one-side is cer- tainly not common in the birds and even likely to be non-existent. All cases can be explained with preference for particular sites of the nest-rim. This conclusion is confirmed when, starting from the sites of the nest- rim on which the two dummies are lying in consecutive series with the same bird, we look for relations with the direction of first retrieval. When the position of the dummies had been altered from one series of minus tests to the next, the gulls maintained the original direction of first retrieval in 54 cases and changed it to the opposite side 58 times. However, if the position had remained unaltered they first rolled 133 times from the same and 74 times from the opposite side. Thus, only when the dummies are in the same position the direction of first retrieval is not randomly distributed. This can, however, be fully explained on the basis of the preference for particular directions of settling demonstrated above, and for particular sites on the nest-rim. As shown, between site and direction of sitting dependency may exist. The data moreover reveal that preference for a site may develop after successful retrieval of an at- tractive incubation object from that site. In 36 series of position preference tests the bird switched its preference in the course of the series. In 22 cases the dummy inducing the bird to shift its position preference was considerably larger than the one on the originally preferred site, in 4 times it had more contrast, in 2 times a more effective colour. Further, not only a dummy with supernormal features, but also an object of better resemblance, could cause the change (4 times a real egg, 4 times the stan- dard dummy). A switch from one site to the other, lasting for the rest of the series, was never observed when the difference between the dummies was small (below the MP-ratio 1.9 on the average) and/or when the strength of the position preference was high (above 1.3 on the average). Summarizing we conclude that the preference for particular sites on the nest-rim is due to the formation of habits in relation to the situation on and around the nest, whereas no evidence for a preferred direction in relation to the own body could be detected.</page><page sequence="269">256 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS 3. Stimulus selection with respect to real and dummy eggs So far the questions about the origin of differences between various stimuli in their effectiveness to elicit incubation responses has been left untouched. The gulls we have tested in the experiments described above were all at least 4 years old and had experience with natural eggs for at least some weeks; most of them probably also in earlier seasons. Ex- perience with their own eggs could have induced the preferences for egg shape and speckling that were found in the gulls. In contrast, the dif- ferences in effectiveness of the various colours investigated cannot wholly be understood on the basis of experience with natural eggs. The green and yellow colours which scored highest differed more from the real egg colours than the brown, blue and grey which generally scored lower (see 11.4.3.). With respect to size, the low value of undersized eggs could possibly be due to experience with real eggs of these sizes, which do not hatch. None of the gulls, however, could have had favourable experience with considerably oversized eggs! It is clear, therefore, that the effectiveness of some of the stimuli involv- ed in releasing incubation responses could be attributed to experience with natural eggs, but others not. The possibility should be left open that in the latter case experience with such stimuli in other situations could have led to the stimulus selection found. Acquired preferences need not necessarily result from learning the features of the adequate object; previous conditioning to such features through experience with other ob- jects could conceivably also be involved. To investigate that possibility extensive and very imaginative research would be necessary. We have restricted ourselves only to some experiments directed at checking whether experience with features of the incubated eggs may influence stimulus selection. a) Experiments on experience with differently coloured natural eggs. In the first place we gave several birds the choice between one of their own eggs and an egg from a different clutch, both placed on the nest-rim. Thirty such tests with 11 different birds resulted in 16 first choices for the own egg and 14 for the alien one. Position preference surely dominated in 21 of these 30 tests; one test had to be classified in the O-category. However, in 2 cases in which a bird possessing dark brown (= 2ni) eggs was given a choice between one of its own eggs and a light greenish ( = 21g) egg from another nest, a 2:0 score was obtained for the own egg.</page><page sequence="270">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 257 In addition a bird which had greenish eggs scored in retrieval tests 4:1 for its own egg against a dark brown one (the only choice for the brown one was dominated by position preference). Once we could do a nest-choice experiment with a bird incubating a clutch of three unusually dark brown eggs. Two artificial nests were made near and symmetrical to the site of the original nest, which was taken away before each test. One test-nest contained the own brown clutch, the other an alien greenish one. In 14 tests, spread over 3 days, the male scored 8:2 for the own brown eggs and the female 3:1. All choices for the alien greenish clutch were dominated by position preference. We neither continued the retrieval nor the nest-choice tests because we were convinced that in most trials with two real eggs position preference of the gull would dominate over a possible preference for one of the eggs. These results suggest that the gulls are in principle capable of distinguishing their own eggs at least from markedly different ones. However, the number of successful tests is low and consequently the results cannot be considered statistically significant. They also do not ex- clude the possibility that features generally attractive for all gulls might happened to have been present in the own eggs and not in the alien eggs used. Nevertheless one may conclude that if herring gulls distinguish their own eggs from alien ones the difference in value between them is mostly less than that commonly present between two different positions on the nest-rim. Although for this reason we abstained from studying discrimination between real eggs in general, we made an exception for one particular type of egg, which seemed to deviate sufficiently to beat the interference of position preference. As described in Section I, sometimes a gull lays unspeckled eggs which then always have a bluish appearance. Three times we had an opportuni- ty to test in owners of such cyanotic clutches the preference for the two special features of such eggs: spotless versus speckles, and a blue back- ground against a standard light-brownish one. The results, to which 6 birds have contributed, are given in Table 76. They are very con- clusive; in spite of having incubated unspeckled eggs (at least during the season of the tests) all birds preferred speckled eggs or speckled dummies over unspeckled ones (columns 2 and 3). Consequently, incubating plain coloured cyanotic eggs did not lead to disappearance of the preference for speckling. The owners of cyanotic clutches were also sensitive to supernormal speckling (column 4). However, owners of cyanotic clutches did prefer wooden dummies with a</page><page sequence="271">258 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS TABLE 76.

Such tests with two plain coloured models on the nest-rim were much more difficult to carry out with the owners of non-cyanotic clutches; the unspeckled dummies seemed to frighten most birds. As reported in II.4, in experiments testing the effectiveness of different background colours in speckled dummies, blue scored much lower than brown. These results suggest that the preference for a blue background only exists in owners of cyanotic clutches and (unless the preference for blue would be genetically linked with the deficiency of pigment) is likely to be learned. In addition these birds appear to become habituated to the absence of speckling on their eggs. b) Experiments on experience with unspeckled dummies. Since cyanotic clutches are extremely rare we have tried to extend the number of tests on experience with unspeckled eggs with eggs evenly painted in the lightbrown standard colour. Clutches of such spotless eggs were exchanged for the original eggs in the beginning of the incubation period. The high mortality of such evenly painted clutches (see III.1.2.) very much restricted the number of tests possible. Only with one female a satisfactory series of tests was obtained. At the end of the incubation</page><page sequence="272">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 259 period she retrieved a normally speckled brown standard dummy first in 12 of 15 tests in which that dummy was tested against the unspeckled one. These 4 weeks of incubating unspeckled eggs had not led to loss of the preference for speckling which we generally found in gulls. c) Experiments with naive gulls on speckling. In all our experiments with dummies or painted eggs the gulls involved were likely to have had experience with natural eggs, in incubation and probably also in feeding situations. Such experience can only be excluded by raising gulls under controlled conditions in captivity from hatching and, at the beginning of the first breeding attempt, test them with dum- mies before or immediately after they have laid their first egg. We TABLE 77.

A pair of gulls had made a nest in the corner of a 7 x 5 x 2 m cage and in the morning of May 19, when Dr GOETHE suspected the 9 to be near to laying her first egg, he put one speckled and one unspeckled dummy closely together on the nest-rim. The ac was the first to be back on the nest and, after some light pecking at both dummies, retrieved the speckled one (t1 = 6 min). During the two following hours 3 further tests could be made, alternating the position of the dummies in successive tests. The result was: speckled vs unspeckled = 3 vs 1. After this the dummies were removed and the nest left empty. Next morning at 12.00 the C was sitting on an egg. Dr GOETHE took this egg away and placed the dummies on the nest-rim; the r retrieved the speckled dummy first and the unspeckled later. On May 21 another test was made with the 0o; he again preferred the speckled dummy. After this test Dr GOETHE forced the 0 from the</page><page sequence="273">260 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS nest and caged him temporarily elsewhere, to allow the 9 to enter the nest and choose between the dummies. She retrieved the speckled dum- my first and the other one 45 sec later. During the rest of the day the nest was left empty and on the next morning the 9 appeared to have laid a new egg and was sitting on it. This egg was gently removed and another test was made; the 9 first retrieved the speckled dummy. Table 77 sum- marizes the results. They suggest a preference for speckling, which under the conditions of the experiment is difficult to conceive as derived from experience with real eggs. 4. Experiments on counter-conditioning of stimulus selection in egg-retrieval Manipulation of the sensitivity to speckling by way of conditioning was also tried for the egg-retrieval response. In a first series of tests the two members of a herring gull pair were, during a two week period, repeatedly confronted with two identical, relatively unattractive dummies of the Li-Me-Da-Bla series, viz. LiMe, on the nest-rim. From time to time, after several retrievals of the two LiMe-dummies on consecutive trials, LiMe was tested against the more attractive ( = contrasting) dummy MeBla. A survey of the tests made and the results obtained is given in Table 78. An influence of the frequent retrieval of the LiMe-dummy on the generally existing preference of MeBla over LiMe is not discernable. In a second type of experiment the retrieval of the generally most effec- tive model of a dummy pair was prevented by providing it with nails and pegging it on the nest-rim. Four series were made for speckling, ten for colour and one for shape. a) Speckling. By presenting a free unspeckled dummy in competition with a pegged speckled one - both of the standard light-brown colour - we tried to reduce and possibly reverse the preference of the gull for speckling. To avoid an influence of position preference the positions of the two dum- mies were alternated in successive tests. Of this experiment 4 series of tests were made. Two of these, with 9 4906 and 0'4908, consisted of less than 10 tests; the results are given in Table 79. They show that the two gulls involved, after some attempt to retrieve the speckled dummy in one or two tests, had acquired the habit of directing themselves first towards the unspeckled dummy. However, the continued occurrence of rolling at-</page><page sequence="274">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 261 TABLE 78.

The results of the other two series (with 9 and o'4973) differ in that the gulls involved either failed to develop the inhibition to retrieve the speckled dummy first or showed it to a much lesser extent.

Q3</page><page sequence="277">264 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS In both series the average number of rolling attempts after retrieval of the plain coloured dummy is about three times as high as the average number before. Such a difference can be understood from the fact that the ti-period was mostly much shorter than the rest of the test period; after a few attempts to move one model of the pair had failed the bird usually tried the other. In neither of the curves for o and 94973 the averages tend to decrease when an increasing number of tests is con- sidered. This shows that these birds did not lose interest in the speckled dummy because it could not be moved. Still, the decrease in the t1-periods of successive tests in the beginning of both series indicates that in these gulls the threshold for retrieving the unspeckled dummy lowered as a result of experience with the pegged one. Learning may also have contributed to the more horizontal stretch of the 'before retrieval' curves of 94973 (tests 3-8, tests 10-15, tests 19-23, tests 23-30) and o4973 (tests 6-19), but this effect is every time broken by bursts of an increased tendency to retrieve, expressed by a conspicuous rise in both the 'before'-and 'after'-curves. We conclude from this experiment that the herring gull is capable of temporarily shifting its preference from a speckled to an unspeckled dum- my after experiencing that the former is not movable. Nevertheless, the primarily high effectiveness of the speckled pattern is not lost and from time to time tends to dominate again, probably whenever the tendency to retrieve rises. For the tests with 9 4906 and 0'4908, in which a switch to preference for the unspeckled dummy seemed to have been achieved, the average length of the period between arrival on the nest and retrieval of the loose dummy (tl-latency) amounted to 3.8 and 6.3 min respectively (Table 79). In contrast, for the tests with 0r and 94973, which only led to indications of a preference shift for limited periods, the average tl-values were 1.5 and 2.0, respectively (Table 80). This suggests that a relatively long ti-period, probably caused by fright for the experimental set-up, might facilitate the incorporation of experience. b) Colour. Two types of experiments were done on the influence of experience with abnormally coloured dummy eggs. In one type a pegged dummy of a col- our that was likely to be preferred was in a series of successive trials presented in competition with a differently coloured dummy. In another type of experiment the natural clutch of a pair was exchanged for eggs painted in an abnormal colour and after a period of undisturbed incuba-</page><page sequence="278">TABLE 81.

If so, the first type of experiment might be repeated. With pair 4902 only the first type experiment was done. First, 0 and 9 of this pair who had been incubating their own clutch without being sub- jected to experiments, were tested on their preference when confronted with a green and a red dummy on the nest rim. In 11 tests the 9 took the green dummy always first, in 8 tests the red dummy was ignored and in 3 tests retrieved after the green one. Only 6 tests were possible with the or. He always retrieved both dummies; in 2 tests he took the green one first and in 4 tests the red one, but 4 of the 6 tests were definitely dominated by position preference. Thus the green preference was clear for the 9, whereas in the o' no preference could be established. Following these tests in which both dummies had been freely movable, an experiment was started in which the green dummy was pegged while the red one was left loose on the nest-rim. The results of this experiment are given in Fig. 62 and Table 81. In both birds the effect of pegging the preferred green dummy is clear; the female has learned to discrimate against it after 36 attempts in 3 tests, the male seemed to learn even more rapidly, but the number of tests possible with this bird were much less and spread over several days. The rationale behind the experiment of the second type was to find out whether a learnt preference built up during incubation could be reversed by later experience. It was carried out with clutches of eggs painted either red, blue or yellow, all with black speckles. If the gulls accepted the clutch we left them undisturbed for at least 2 weeks. When at the end of this period the clutch was found well tended for, dummy retrieval tests were started to test the stimulus value of different groundcolours. After a preference had been established for a particular colour we again tried to reduce or reverse it by repeatedly presenting pegged dummies of that col- our in choice tests with other colours. In 2 nests, 4954 and 4974, the original clutch was exchanged for red painted eggs. Table 82 gives the scores obtained with these birds in choice tests with a red and green dum- my on the nest-rim. A preference for red was clear in Q 4954 and c4974, a tendency towards this preference was indicated in 94974, whereas oC4954 still showed the marked preference for green generally found in the herring gulls. We conclude that at least 2, and possible 3 of the 4 birds involved had learned that their eggs were red and were apply- ing this knowledge in making their choice. Whether 4954 had not ac- quired this knowledge or was merely not applying it cannot be decided from the results of these tests.</page><page sequence="280">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 267 n '4$ *^ , ; &amp;.,5 10 *":.''i?,r . e Fig. 62.

The data show that after 4-8 tests in which a bird had tried 5-30 times to roll the pegged red dummy first, of course without success, a shift occurred towards first retrieval of the green dummy.

His 9 seem- ed to evaluate both colours equally highly, whereas o and 94952 both still preferred green over blue (Table 82). Subsequent experiments with one dummy pegged were done with the birds of 4978 only. Because of the marked preference for blue of the a, pegging of the blue dummy was applied.

From then on it mostly ig- nored the blue dummy after retrieval of the loose one, except for the first trial on June 22. Initially, however, it strongly responded to the pegged blue dummy and waited long before retrieving the loose alternative; this caused the high level of the 'before-retrieval' curve after June 19. In the 9 the horizontal parts in the 'before-retrieval' curve on June 20 and 21 also speak for learning not to retrieve the blue model first, but two times (tests 7 and 12) this learning effect is broken. The effect of experience with the fixed blue dummy appears more consistent in the a than in the 9; this is also indicated by the data in Table 83. Finally, in one nest, 4960, the original clutch was replaced by a yellow one. As yellow is generally preferred over all colours used, with the ex- ception of green, the effect of the incubation period on yellow eggs was tested by pairing the yellow dummy with a green one. As shown in Table 82 the data for ao and 9 tend towards a preference for the yellow dummy. Consequently in the next phase of the experiment the yellow dummy was /i 269</page><page sequence="283">270 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS TABLE 82.

Table 84 and the curves of Fig. 65 indicate that ex- perience with the fixed yellow dummy induced in 0o and 9 an inhibition to retrieve yellow before blue. However, after retrieval of the blue dum- my, the interest for the yellow one did not show a decline. We are of opinion that the results of our experiments show that the gulls are in principle able to learn about the colour of the eggs which they are incubating. However, individual differences and probably also tem- poral fluctuations, occur in the application of this knowledge in egg- retrieval experiments. The effect of the conditioning attempt appeared to be less successful in case of a blue, than of a red or a yellow clutch. Through pegging a green dummy the gulls quickly learned not to retrieve it first but take the red one instead. Whether this should be inter- preted as a positive response to red or a negative to green (taking the not- green dummy first) cannot be decided with the data available. Birds which had been incubating yellow dummies, and as a result seemed to rate that colour slightly higher than green, readily learned to ignore yellow in first retrievals, in favour of the blue alternative. Birds which had been sitting on red dummies also learned to avoid rolling the red dummy first (in competition with a green one) but they acted much less consistently.

If sitting on red eggs would not have influenc- ed the colour preference of the birds one would have expected them to  273</page><page sequence="287">274 KRUIJT &amp; BAERENDS give up the pegged red dummy much more quickly in favour of the generally attractive and freely movable green one. The bird (0'4978) which, after sitting on blue eggs, showed a clear preference for blue over green, stopped favouring the pegged blue dum- my after the 9th test. In contrast its mate ( 4978) did not show signs of conditioning to blue, neither when tested with free, nor with pegged dummies. The former bird seemed to have been more open to condition- ing than the latter one. In the egg-rolling tests described above, practically always two aber- rant colours were given in competition to find out whether conditioning had taken place. It is interesting to mention, that in a few instances in which the more natural looking standard brown dummy was given together with a dummy of the abnormal colour of the painted eggs in- cubated, this brown dummy was preferred. o and 9 4952 who had been sitting on a blue clutch scored 8-0 for brown against blue, o and 9 4954 who had a red clutch scored 5-1 for brown against red. These gulls un- doubtedly had previous experience with brownish natural eggs and most likely for a much longer time (previous seasons) than they had spent on the painted eggs. When comparing the data on the effect of experience between pegged dummies of different colour it is striking that the inhibition to retrieve is built up quickest when the pegged dummy is green or yellow, whereas the results of the attempts to inhibit retrieval of blue and red dummies were much less clear. It is interesting to note that green and yellow were in chapter 4 found to have a supernormal effect in incubation situations. c) Shape. In another series a pair of gulls (4912), which had been incubating a nor- mal clutch, was, in the course of 3 days, offered a freely movable rounded block-shaped dummy (RB, see Plate VII) against a pegged brown speck- led standard one. Only with the 9 a longer series of tests could be made. In this series no change was found in the trend of the average number of attempts to move the pegged dummy (Fig. 64b). The bird did not learn to turn first to the abnormally shaped but free movable dummy. In 11.3. and 11.7. it was found that the difference in effectiveness between the egg- shaped and the block-shaped dummies is likely to be less than between differently coloured ones. We are, therefore inclined to think that the bird in this series of tests was not repelled by the block-shaped dummy, but rather that it did not manage to associate the difference between the dum- mies with the possibility of moving them. The partner of this gull, as well</page><page sequence="288">INFLUENCE OF EXPERIENCE 275 as two other pairs tried, quickly gave up responding to any of the models on the nest-rim, so that the series started with them had to be discon- tinued. 5. Conclusion The capacity to learn about features of the environment is extensively used by the gulls for topographical orientation. The way they approach their nests is strongly influenced by habit formation. This also holds for the directions in which the gulls prefer to settle on the nest; the ensuing habits influence in turn the site-tenacity exhibited in the retrieval choice tests. The gulls are potentially able to acquire during the incubation period knowledge about the features of their eggs. In some cases they were even shown to distinguish their own eggs from alien eggs with a somewhat dif- ferent appearance. Unnatural aberrant features, experimentally applied to the egg, can also be learned. However, knowledge acquired about the own natural or dummy clutch is easily overruled by a priori preferences for particular features, for some of which it could be made likely that they cannot have been obtained as a result of experience with the adequate ob- ject. The most satisfactory support for this conclusion is given by the data on the preference for speckling. The extent to which knowledge about the eggs, acquired during the in- cubation period, is applied by the gulls strongly varies between in- dividuals and fluctuates with time. This in combination with the diversity and the small numbers of the tests carried out, makes conclusions about factors that might possibly influence the learning processes involved, ex- tremely hazardous. Yet, some indications can be found in the data on speckling pattern and on colour, that the method of pegging an egg on the nest-rim might be more effective for influencing a preference than that of changing the clutch incubated. Furthermore the data suggest that the birds more easily learned to avoid the speckled, the green and the yellow dummies than the red, and in particular the blue ones. Our at- tempts to teach a bird to discriminate between shapes through pegging one of the dummies presented on the nest-rim were entirely unsuccessful within a period which sufficed for speckling or colour. Does this mean that features with a supernormal effectiveness for particular response are also more easily learnt?</page><page sequence="289">SECTION V GENERAL DISCUSSION by G. P. BAERENDS A. THE MECHANISMS OF STIMULUS SELECTION Introduction Our main problem is to understand the causation of stimulus selection in responses towards eggs. Striking results of our analysis of the stimulus situation evoking incubation responses were the simplicity of the input required and the preferences established for features deviant from those of the natural stimulus situation concerned. This input is a very limited representation of the features of the adequate object, but it comprises characteristic ones. The possibility of increasing the effectiveness of a component of the stimulus situation by making it artificially 'supernor- mal' is a result of this low number of components involved and of their processing through heterogeneous summation. In II.b. evidence has been given that, when a gull is afraid, the effec- tiveness of supernormal stimuli becomes reduced in favour of stimuli cor- responding more closely with the natural situation and of which the knowledge is likely to have been acquired by the gull through experience with the adequate object. This observation opens the perspective that the phenomenon of supernormality might be used as a cue for reaching some understanding of how the potentiality to react specifically to a stimulus situation might be realized in an animal, in spite of a total lack of ex- perience with that situation. This problem is not solved by labelling it 'in- nate', 'inborn' or 'genetically determined'; although the basis of this potentiality must be coded in the genes, the questions should be raised how it is coded and how decoding is taking place. Whereas LORENZ'S (1935, 1937) concept of innate releasing mechanism suggested the existence of central filter mechanisms, each specific for a response, other authors (LEHRMAN, 1953; SCHNEIRLA, 1956) have em- phasized the possibility that properties of the sensory organs and general properties of the perception process might be largely responsible. This has led SCHLEIDT (1962) to a plea to include the entire chain of perceptual</page><page sequence="290">GENERAL DISCUSSION 277 processes, from the reception by the sensory organs to the activation of a motor response, in the releasing mechanism concept. A similar point of view had already been advanced by MARLER (1961) on the basis of a con- siderable amount of data available in the literature. Studies aimed at the identification of the stimuli to which the releasing mechanism postulated in some animal for a particular response would be sensitive, were mostly concerned with cases in which this sensitivity was thought to exist independently of experience with the adequate object. This occurred under the influence of the emphasis LORENZ (1935, 1965) laid on what he called 'innateness' of a response, and in spite of LASHLEY'S (1938) advice to incorporate also learning processes into con- siderations on the nature of the activation of motor patterns by a specific stimulus situation. LORENZ was certainly aware that learning processes could become incorporated in this chain and SCHLEIDT (1962) has at- tempted a classification of the various ways in which this might theoretically occur. Both authors maintained a strict dichotomy between 'innate' and 'learned', which biassed them towards thinking in terms of distinct behavioural elements of each type instead of units resulting from integrated influences of intrinsic and experiential factors. However it may be, at present a basic concept of the ways in which in- formation leading to the activation of a response is being processed, which could cover the numerous variations we must expect and which does not suffer from the nature/nurture dichotomy, is lacking. It seems to me that our data on the activation of egg-retrieval provide a basis for at- tempting a design for such a comprehensive basic concept. Building it up will be the purpose of the first three chapters of this Section. This will be combined with comparison and completion of our data with data available in the literature. The most parsimonious explanation of the phenomenon of stimulus selection is a filter mechanism imposed by properties of the receptors, the most complicated explanation would be the assumption of specific central filter mechanisms for each response. In case of the former alternative one would expect a considerable amount of overlap in the degree of effec- tiveness of various stimuli for different responses in a species, as well as for similar responses in closely related species. If the latter alternative would be realized one would expect a pronounced response specificity of stimulus selection. Therefore, our first approach of the data is aimed at finding out to what extent stimulus selection can be considered response specific.</page><page sequence="291">CHAPTER 1 TO WHAT EXTENT IS STIMULUS SELECTION RESPONSE SPECIFIC? A COMPARATIVE REVIEW OF LITERATURE DATA RELEVANT TO THE PRESENT STUDY I shall start this review of the literature with studies on incubation responses, first in the herring gull - for which species I have tried to achieve completeness of the review - and second in related species - where I have omitted the more anecdotal data. Subsequently studies on stimulus selection in other functional contexts, in the herring gull and in related species, will be considered. The data will be grouped, in accord- ance with the four principle stimulus categories distinguished throughout the present paper, in the order: colour, speckling, size and shape. For our purpose I consider the data on colour as the most instructive ones. 1. Incubation responses a. Herring gull. None of the other authors working on the stimuli inducing incubation responses in the herring gull have used our method of giving the gulls a choice between two different dummies on the nest-rim. However, a number of other types of experiments have been made which produced results relevant to our issue. CULEMANN (1928), STEINBACHER (1931, 1937), GOETHE (1937) and WINKEL (1976) exchanged one or more eggs from the original clutch for dummies or painted eggs and presented these inside the nest-bowl. The first three authors have reported on their results in only a condensed qualitative and anecdotal way. In some cases the reaction of the gull was watched, but more often the state of the clutch was periodically inspected. On the basis of such inspections WINKEL gives quantitative data on the survival of the clutches submitted to an experi- ment. He exchanged the entire clutch for 3 equal dummies on day 7, after the third egg had been laid, and determined at what date the nest was first abandoned. This more often happened between day 40 and 100 (thus after the normal incubation period had passed) than within the in- cubation time of 27 days. TINBERGEN (1953) undertook with several co-workers choice tests be- tween two clutches placed in two artificial nests. They kept the birds under continuous observation during each test. The results of these authors may be summarized as follows.</page><page sequence="292">GENERAL DISCUSSION 279 Colour. CULEMAN (1928) reports that painting eggs blue, green, black or white does not induce the gulls to abandon the nest; this in contrast to red painted eggs or various red alien objects. GOETHE (1937) states that usually replacement of eggs in the clutch by evenly painted blue, yellow,or green dummies did not stop the birds from continuing their care, although at first encounters with such objects the gulls showed clear signs of noticing the change. He tended to the view that the gulls soon overcome their first reluctance to accept dummies. Nests with red dum- mies were, however, more often abandoned than incubated. The gulls often pecked at the red dummies, but not at dummies of other colours. Unfortunately, neither of these authors gives a quantitative survey of the data they obtained. GOETHE cites a number of records; one of them con- tains the interesting observation of a white sheld-duck egg being removed from the nest-bowl by shifting and rolling activities. He also reports some cases in which red and blue eggs were moved away from the nest; some of his birds did not accept green dummies. In contrast to the reports of CULEMANN &amp; GOETHE, STEINBACHER (1931, 1937) was unable to find an appreciable influence of painting eggs red or black. Among several other experiments with herring- and black-headed gulls (which will come up for discussion below) THOMPSON (1970) did one which might be interpreted as an egg-retrieval experiment. She placed differently coloured wooden cylinders (3.5 x 5.5 cm) singly on a sand platform level with the nest, at 22 cm distance from its centre (thus out- side the nest-rim). Per dummy at least 150 tests were made. After 5-8 hours the position of the dummies was checked. In ca 42% of all tests made of this type at inspection the dummy was found in situ, in ca 40% it had been rolled into the nest, and in ca 18% the dummy had been moved away. The latter was observed to be done, either by means of the retrieval act (the gull standing outside the nest with its tail pointing away from it), or by taking the dummy in the bill. The differences found be- tween colours are not statistically significant; they suggest that the non- spectral colours brown, olive-green and purple were relatively more often rolled towards, but orange more often away from the nest. In comparison with other colours green was neither particularly preferred, nor rejected. WINKEL'S (1976) quantitative experiments do show distinct differences in the responses to various abnormally coloured unspeckled dummies. Surprisingly 18 of the 28 nests (64%) with green dummies were given up</page><page sequence="293">280 G. P. BAERENDS before day 27. For red this was 7 of a total of 19 (37%), for yellow 7 of 25 (28%), for blue 5 of 19 (26%) and for normally coloured dummies 3 of 19 (16%). None of the 13 white clutches were prematurely given up and merely one out of 14 black clutches. The median incubation time for green (51 days) was significantly below those for the others which varied between 60 and 67 days. This contrasts strongly with our results on col- our painted clutches, given in III.1.2. Here the mortality of speckled clutches with different background colours increased in the order: brown - green and yellow - blue - red. TINBERGEN (1953) gives data of clutch choice experiments in which blue, yellow and red, black and grey spotted, dummies were presented in competition with normally coloured ones. Only the response to red dum- mies can be considered different from that to the others; it was lower. No data on green are given. Speckling. WINKEL (1976) found a very clear effect of speckling on total incubation time; the median for plain dummies was 60, that for speckled ones 72 days. This is in full agreement with our results on nest attendance (111.1.2.). TINBERGEN (1953) and co-workers did not find a consistent difference between speckled normal dummies and unspeckled dummies of a grey series (including black and white) in nest choice tests. They also did not find a preference when offering with the same technique to owners of a cyanotic clutch, plain blue eggs versus natural coloured ones (BooY &amp; TINBERGEN, 1937). Since our evidence on the effect of speckling, obtained in egg-retrieval (II.1.), nest choice (III.1.1.), and nest-attendance (III. 1.2.) experiments is very strong and consistent, I am of opinion that in TINBERGEN's experiments this effect did not show up because of insuffi- cient sensitivity of the technique used and of the low number of tests in these earlier experiments. Size. In tests on 5 gulls TINBERGEN'S co-workers CAUDRI &amp; QUISPEL (pers. comm.; TINBERGEN, 1953) scored 13-0 for a clutch of normally sized dummies in competition with one of dummies of half the normal linear size (our code 4). Further a single egg of two times the normal linear dimensions placed in one of the nests scored 6-0 against one normally siz- ed egg in the other, but 2-4 against a clutch of 3 normally sized dummies. WINKEL (1976), however, did not find significant differences in the me-</page><page sequence="294">GENERAL DISCUSSION 281 dian incubation time of normally coloured wooden or plastic dummies of 38, 52, 72 and 96 mm length (corresponding with our sizes 4, 5, 7 and 10, respectively). I think that this difference is due to the fact that in short term egg- retrieval and clutch choice experiments only visual stimuli from the eggs play a role, whereas in long term experiments on nest attendance, beside these visual stimuli, tactile stimuli, in particular from the brood patch, are also important determinants of the behaviour of the bird. Although during our 20 min tests the gulls repeatedly and intensively tried to in- cubate eggs larger than size 10 they obviously could not quietly remain sitting on them for long periods and, in the few cases we continued such tests, they abandoned the nest within a hour. Probably the dummies used by WINKEL deviated insufficiently from the normal size to induce aban- donment. Shape. Using the same rounded and sharp-edged cylinders, blocks and prisms as depicted in our Plate VII, CAUDRI, QUISPEL &amp; PERDECK (pers. comm.) found indications of a preference for normal over abnormal shape and of rounded over sharp edges in clutch choice tests. Their results, summariz- ed by TINBERGEN (1953) are in agreement with our conclusions. However, the number of tests is small and since for each test the number of approaches, of settling intentions and of incubation bouts was added to produce a score I consider the end results in TINBERGEN'S tables as quan- titatively flattered. WINKEL (1976) found no difference in the median incubation time for clutches of three ball shaped, rounded cylinder shaped, and normal shaped dummies (72-79 days). But for clutches of sharp edged blocks and of dummies with a rippled surface he found a significantly shorter median incubation time (57-64). In case of these long term experiments on shape we should also be aware that apart from visual stimuli received before settling, tactile stimulation during incubation must be of importance. We are, therefore, inclined to conclude that, with the dummy lying in the nest, aberrant shape will not prevent the birds from settling on the dum- mies, but that continued deficiencies of the tactile feedback from such a clutch is the main cause of abandoning the nest. Settling on odd shaped objects such as cubical- or polyhedral dummies, pieces of wood, shells, pine cones, light bulbs, small food tins, etc. has been reported by several authors (e.g. CULEMANN, 1928; GOETHE, 1937; ourselves). When directly observed, the gulls - in particular when confronted with such objects in</page><page sequence="295">282 G. P. BAERENDS the nest for the first time - showed distinct signs of noticing the abnor- mality, touching and moving the object with the bill and sometimes car- rying it away. b. Related species. Colour. Most experiments on related species concern the groundcolour of the egg. DIRCKSEN (1933) concluded from a number of experiments in which eggs of sandwich terns (Sterna sandvicensis) were replaced by white, blue and red painted chicken-eggs that such changes are noticed by the bird but that only in case of red are they likely to lead to abandoning the nest. NOBLE &amp; LEHRMAN (1940) drew similar conclusions from various ex- periments with wholly or partly painted eggs placed in or near nests of the laughing gull (L. atricilla). MARPLES (1932) reported that in tests with TABLE 85. Experiments with black-headed gulls on preference for the brownish or the greenish coloured egg in retrieval tests with real eggs, in- volving one egg from the own clutch (after BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975) Number of All tests Minus tests Plus tests gulls involved brown vs green brown vs green brown vs green a) Own brown egg vs strange green egg 11 41-23 13-13 28-10 b) Strange brown egg vs own green egg 12 46-73 15-19 31-54 ringed plovers differently coloured egg dummies were retrieved from distances up to 8 cm from the nest; blue and red, however, after a longer latency period than other colours used (orange, yellow, green, violet, brown, white). KOEHLER &amp; ZAGARUS (1937) working with the same species found a white background to be more effective than a yellow one on speckled dummies, while other colours scored lower. In the black-headed gull BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN (1975), applying the egg-retrieval choice technique used throughout the present paper, com- pared the relative effectiveness of brown speckled and green speckled eggs. In contrast to the results obtained for the herring gull, they found a distinct preference for the brown over the green groundcolour in most of the birds tried. However, the preference for brown was stronger (see</page><page sequence="296">GENERAL DISCUSSION 283 Table 85) for gulls incubating a clutch of more brownish (Ostwald scale 2-4; see Fig. 3) than of more greenish eggs (scale 21-1). They also found the owners of brownish clutches to prefer brown real eggs over green ones and the owners of green clutches to have the reversed preference. Conse- quently they concluded that the preferences of black-headed gulls, more than those of herring gulls, are determined by acquired knowledge about their own eggs. This fits the fact that in the herring gull brown preference was found to replace green preference in tests with longer latencies; thus in tests in which the use of acquired knowledge was more likely (p. 109ff). 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 bEl( gE bD gD 145 146 143 144 147 148 oE bE E bE Fig. 66. Scores of the black-headed gull R2 9 on 23-5-'74 in 15 successive tests (134-148) in which speckled real eggs (E) or dummies (D) with a greenish (g) or a brownish (b) groundcolour were presented in competition. The initial preference for brown (134-140) switched, after the presentation of dummies, via a phase in which preference for position dominated (141-144) to a preference for green (145-148). The own eggs of this gull were brownish. Occasionally, however, a black-headed gull - particularly after having been submitted to several tests - switched from a brown to a green preference. Fig. 66 shows such a case. It therefore appears that the black- headed gull too is potentially able to respond to supernormal colouration in addition to a colouration resembling that of the real eggs, but that it less often applies this potentiality. Experiments carried out by TSCHANZ (pers. comm.) on this species in the late sixties in TINBERGEN'S field sta- tion support this view. In one experiment this author placed eggs, evenly painted in one of three colours, singly at 18 cm distance from the centre of the nest on a sand platform, level with the nest-rim. After an interval of 30 min in which the bird was left alone, retrieval was found to have taken place in 25.7% of the presentations of a green painted egg, in 17.4% of blue and in 14.4% of brown ones. Whereas in this experiment the birds were in- cubating their own unchanged clutch, in a second experiment gulls which</page><page sequence="297">284 G. P. BAERENDS had for 8 days been incubating eggs painted either green, blue or brown, were given a choice between two eggs on the platform, each painted in another of these three colours, but both different from the colour the birds had been incubating. The introductory period, allowing the birds to become habituated to colour change of their eggs, was found necessary to make them accept the set-up for the choice tests. Again the results suggest a decreasing preference in the order green -blue--brown; green eggs were more often retrieved first than blue and brown ones and blue more often than brown. In addition to this experiment, in which the colour of the eggs incubated was different from the colours presented, TSCHANZ ran a third type of experiment in which an egg painted in the colour in- cubated was presented in competition with one of the two other colours used. After one day incubation the order of preference was not different from that in the second experiment, but after 7 or more days a clear preference for the colour incubated was found to have developed. The results of a similar experiment with black-headed gulls, published by TINBERGEN, KRUUK &amp; PAILLETTE (1962, Table IV) suggest moreover that the birds more easily learn the new colour of their eggs when green than when black paint had been applied. Speckling. Spots were found effective in the black-headed gull (BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975) and in the ringed plover, where KOEHLER &amp; ZAGARUS (1937) found black spots on a white background to induce strong responses whereas unspeckled dummies were not retrieved. Size. Preference for oversized eggs was also found in the black-headed gull (Larus r. ridibundus) (BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975) and in the oyster- catcher (Haematopus ostralegus) (TINBERGEN, 1948a, 1951). The latter bird preferred a 16 cm long egg over a clutch of its own egg (size). Ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) refused to retrieve egg dummies of over 35 g but retrieved those between 17 and 3.5 g (own egg 11.5 g) (KOEHLER &amp; ZAGARUS, 1937). Shape. Incubation of odd objects, such as reported from the herring gull, has also been seen in other gull species. KIRKHAM (1937) has reported it from the black-headed gull, NOBLE &amp; LEHRMAN (1940) from the laughing gull. POULSEN (1953) has presented various kinds of odd-shaped egg-dummies</page><page sequence="298">GENERAL DISCUSSION 285 to different species of birds (geese, ducks, pigeons, some passerines and a condor) either on the nest-rim or in the nest-bowl. The results are similar to those obtained with herring gulls: that the egg deviated was obviously noticed and the chance of a dummy not to be retrieved or settled upon in- creased with its deviation from egg shape (rounded versus edged, globular or cylindrical versus block shaped, cubical or pyramidal, etc.). An odd dummy in the nest seemed to have a greater chance of being accepted than one on the nest-rim. However, the number of tests and their varia- tion does not allow a concise summary of the results. For that reason I abstained from referring to numerous similar experiments POULSEN did on other egg features. c. Conclusion. With regard to colour all authors agree that red has the lowest effec- tiveness for incubation responses and may even release pecking at the stimulus object. Mixed brown-greenish colours, resembling those of the natural egg, are in general well accepted for incubation and so is yellow. Blue is sometimes rejected. Most important, however, is that the marked preference for green found in our experiments did not clearly show up in the experiments of other authors. Only some indications of it were found in the black-headed gull experiments mentioned above. I am not surprised that the preference for green does not appear in the kind of experiments in which a bird is only tested once, just by placing the dummy near the nest and without watching the behaviour of the gull. If our hypothesis, that fear inhibits the green preference, is true one can only expect birds used to the experimental procedure to show this preference. For the black-headed gull TSCHANZ (pers. comm.) has stress- ed the anxiety of the birds for changes applied to the eggs or the nest situation. In our egg-retrieval experiments the birds were always habituated to the procedure first; I think this is one reason why THOMP- SON (1970) did not find a high responsiveness to green over differently coloured cylinders. Other possible reasons are the use of an artificial plat- form, which will definitely have scared the birds, the relatively long distance from the nest at which the dummy was placed, the absence of speckling, the deviation from egg-shape and the low sensitivity of ex- periments in which single dummies are successively tested. I find it more difficult to understand the discrepancy between our ex- periment on nest-attendance of clutches painted in different colours (III. 1.2.) and the very similar experiments made by WINKEL (1976). Our results agree in that brownish normally coloured clutches had the lowest</page><page sequence="299">286 G. P. BAERENDS mortality. This speaks for the role of familiar features in locating the nest and inducing protection and incubation. The problem is why in WINKEL'S experiments many more green clutches were earlier given up than red, blue and yellow ones, while the conspicuous white ones suffered no premature losses. An important difference with our experiment is that WINKEL did not paint speckles on the egg. This must certainly have in- creased the fear of the birds for the change done to the nest content and must have retarded their return, probably more with conspicuous un- common colours than with the somewhat less unusual blue and white. Hesitation of the nest owner in returning to the clutch gives other gulls an opportunity for predation. In the colonies I am familiar with, uncovered eggs of eider-ducks, which are green and unspeckled, are heavily predated upon. It is just a guess that gulls used to such eggs as food might have caused the high losses of green clutches in WINKEL'S experiments. As regards speckling the result of all studies agree in that speckling in- creases the value of a larid egg as an incubation object. A tendency to prefer supernormal size was found in all studies using retrieval or intention-settling as a criterion. In nest-attendance, however, the visual attractiveness of oversized eggs is overruled by the repulsive ef- fect of the deficiencies of the feedback stimulation received from con- siderably oversized eggs. All evidence indicates that the gulls distinguish egg-shape from deviant shapes of objects placed in or near the nest. They are likely to retrieve and/or incubate objects of various shapes as long as these are rounded; towards sharp edged objects they are more hesitant and because of them the gulls may leave the nests in the long run. Summarizing one may say that although on the one hand ample evidence from different authors indicate that gulls are sensitive to changes in the colour, speckling, size and shape of their eggs, they are on the other hand - when used to the experimental procedure - apt to prefer in choice tests with retrieval or initial-settling as criteria dummies of enlarged size and exaggerated speckling. The preference for 'supernor- mal' green found in our experiments was not found by other authors in the herring gull, probably because of differences in the techniques used; however, indications were obtained that it might also exist in the black- headed gull. All authors are unanimous about a negative effect of red on incubation behaviour. This occurrence in the same animal of two apparently incompatible phenomena, viz. sensitivity for deviations from the normal egg ap- pearance and a high responsiveness to 'superstimuli', demands an ex- planation.</page><page sequence="300">GENERAL DISCUSSION 287 2. Other responses For a survey of the literature on stimulus selection in various other responses of larid birds I have chosen to classify them primarily according to the kind of stimulation, secondarily in relation to the kind of response, and finally the species involved. a. Colour. Beside the incubation response the only other response of larid birds to colour and greys of different intensities, on which a vast amount of data has been collected (by various authors), is the begging response of juvenile gulls. This response culminates in pecking at the bill of the parent and induces feeding by regurgitation. The first extensive study was made by TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) in the herring gull. The head of the herring gull is white, its bill yellow and the end of the bill, in particular the lower mandible, carries a red spot. HEINROTH &amp; HEINROTH (1928) had suggested that this red spot might have a function with respect to the food pecking of the young, and GOETHE (1937) had shown this to be true by presenting chicks with two heads of freshly killed herring gulls, in one of which the red patch had been painted out. TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK extended this experiment to various components of this stimulus situation, including a number of characteristics of the red patch. While imitating the parent's feeding call, they moved flat cardboard dummies of the parent's head in front of a single chick which had temporarily been taken from the nest. Different dummies were successively presented. One series of dummies was made for checking the effectiveness of dif- ferent head colours: the head and neck were either blue, green, yellow, red, white, grey or black, the bill was always yellow with a red spot in these.tests. In a first series dummies with green and yellow heads received a higher amount of pecks than a white head, the other colours and shades scored about equal to white. This result reminds one of the colour preference we found for egg-retrieval. However, the authors felt that this apparent relatively high effectiveness of green and yellow might have been due to green and yellow being presented more often than the other colours in the beginning of a series of tests, so the entire experiment was repeated. This time the scores for green and yellow were not above those for the other colours. A comparison of differently coloured bills (without the. red spot and attached to a white head) showed that the responsiveness to red was twice as high as that to yellow, blue, green, white and black.</page><page sequence="301">288 G. P. BAERENDS The response to grey was somewhat lower, only 38% of that to the red bill. When white heads with yellow bills were presented with differently coloured patches, red scored highest, followed by black and blue (respec- tively, 86% and 71% of the number of pecks at the red spot); white ob- tained only 59% of the number of pecks directed at red patches. Thus for evoking the begging response red proved to be the most effective colour. Later - as part of a more extensive programme of experiments with which we shall deal below - this analysis was again taken up by THOMPSON (1970) with a more sophisticated technique. She used herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls, very closely related species with similarly coloured heads and bills, both with the same results. With regard to the pecking response she did two types of experiments, both with incubator-hatched chicks singly placed in a standard grey box. In one experiment two 8.5 x 1.0 cm cardboard strips were presented next to each other, each painted in a different colour or grey shade. In the other experiment, instead of the painted strips, two 3.5 x 0.5 cm light patches were projected on a ground glass wall of the box, their colour and intensi- ty being controlled by interference and neutral density filters. Both the strips and the projected patches were swung to and fro roughly 60 times per minute. As in most of her experiments, this author compared the ef- fectiveness of different colours and of different grey shades separately, but she also compared colours against greys in 'mixed' tests. With both techniques the responsiveness to middle wavelengths (530-580, green and yellow) was lowest and that to longer (orange, red) and shorter (blue) wavelengths high. The differential responsiveness to the colours was a genuine colour effect. The high effectiveness of blue and red (in fact higher for blue than red) and the low one for green was confirmed by NYSTROM (1972) in comparative experiments with suc- cessive and with pairwise presentation of coloured and grey paper strips in the herring gull. A second larid species on which similar experiments have been exten- sively carried out is the black-headed gull (L. ridibundus). It has a dark red bill which is red inside, and a dark chocolate-brown, almost black, hood. R. WEIDMANN (1956), R. &amp; U. WEIDMANN (1958), U. WEIDMANN (1961) and IMPEKOVEN (1969) found also in this species high pecking rates to blue and red and low ones to green and yellow. A series of 5 grey shades, varying from black to white, showed an increasing responsiveness with decrease of brightness (R. WEIDMANN, 1956). Since the scores for red and blue were higher than those for black, a genuine colour preference must also be involved in the begging response. IMPEKOVEN, moreover, found</page><page sequence="302">GENERAL DISCUSSION 289 the responsiveness to black to be lower in chicks deprived from food ('hungry chicks') than in chicks only deprived from cover by the parents ('cold chicks'). In both cases they approach the parents but in the former case primarily to start begging and in the latter to snuggle. In a very similar American species, the laughing gull (L. atricilla), HAILMAN (1967) intensively studied the begging response. Here too he found, with interference filters as well as with painted dummies, the curve, representing the number of pecks per time unit plotted against wavelength, to be of a bimodal nature, with a minimum at 550 m/y and rising to about equally high values below 450 and beyond 600 m/t. A fourth gull species in which this response was studied is the Franklin's gull (L. pipixcan). This species has a bright red bill with a vague dusky spot near the tip, its head is black. COLLIAS &amp; COLLIAS (1957) presented to chicks of this species in choice experiments cardboard head dummies of which the cut-out bill area could be illuminated through coloured cellophane. The response rate decreased in the order red- green -white. Two species with an entirely yellow bill (though with a red gape as in the former species), the common gull (L. canus) and the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) have been tested for the effectiveness of colours in releasing and/or directing the pecking response. FRANCK (1966) found in common gull chicks a preference for a red patch in simultaneous and successive presentation of yellow bill-dummies with and without a red spot. CULLEN &amp; CULLEN (1962) established for the kittiwake again a higher response rate to red than to yellow (the only colours tested). It is interesting that in contrast a single black-headed gull chick, hatched in a kittiwake nest and reared by its foster parents preferred yellow over red. Although R. WEIDMANN (1956) found such a preference occasionally in black-headed gulls (in one individual out of 28) the CULLENS are more inclined to at- tribute this yellow preference to conditioning to the external bill colour of the foster parents. U. WEIDMANN (1961) has managed to condition chicks of this species to primarily unattractive bill colours by rewarding each peck with food. The colour sensitivity of the begging response was also studied in a number of tern species. Two species with red bills, the caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia) and the arctic tern (S. macrura) were studied by BERGMAN (1953) and QUINE &amp; CULLEN (1964), respectively. Chicks of the caspian tern responded more often to red (76%) than to black (57%). In the study of the arctic tern the chicks were confronted with a great assort- ment of hues. The numbers of pecks per time unit decreased in the order:</page><page sequence="303">290 G. P. BAERENDS blue - red - silver - green - orange - black - white - yellow. Not much difference was shown between the response rate to four hues of red on the one hand and four hues of blue on the other. CULLEN (1962) found in chicks of the wideawake tern (Sternafuscata), a species with a black bill, an equal responsiveness to red and black dum- mies and a somewhat lower response rate to silver, grey and white. In another species with a black (yellow tipped) bill, the sandwich tern (S. scandvicensis), U. WEIDMANN (1961) found a preference for black over red. From the evidence given here I conclude that the curve representing the effectiveness of the different spectral colours for inducing pecking responses in chicks of larid birds has the shape of an inverted U, with peaks for red and blue, and a trough for green. Although not all studies cover the spectral range from blue to red, none of them is in conflict with this conclusion. Differences, however, seem to occur in the effectiveness found in different studies for black, white and various shades of grey. In several species the blue and red preference was established in incubator- hatched chicks, thus in chicks without experience with the parental bill. It is striking that this picture of the relative effectiveness of the spectral colours is practically the inverse of that found for the incubation responses. We should realize that the former has been obtained with juvenile and the latter with adult birds. However, it is not likely that the difference can be attributed to a dramatic change in the spectral sensitivi- ty curves when the birds grow up. With electroretinographic and pupillometric methods THOMPSON (1970, 1971) has determined such curves for juveniles from 4-9 months old and for adults. The difference is slight; for the shorter wavelength the sensitivity of the juveniles rises somewhat above that of the adults, the difference gradually increasing below 550 m/t. To explain a reverse of responsiveness a much more radical change in sensitivity would be needed. The spectral sensitivity of gulls below 4 months, thus actually of chicks, was not tested; however there are no reasons to assume that their sensitivity would so strongly deviate. A much more promising candidate for an explanation seems to be the possibility that different motivational systems might differentially exert control on how the information received by the sensory organs is process- ed. This raises the question whether the U-shaped preference might be characteristic for feeding responses in general, thus for a feeding state, in gulls of all ages. With this in mind we undertook our experiments on feeding responses towards egg-like and other objects (111.2.1. and 2.). A number of the experiments made by THOMPSON (1970) are also relevant in this context.</page><page sequence="304">GENERAL DISCUSSION 291 When presenting differently painted eggs to free-living gulls in their social roost areas we found the lowest responsiveness to green eggs. Red was at the top, with brown and yellow near to it. The response to blue was intermediate. In one of THOMPSON'S experiments too the feeding responses were im- mediately directed at food. In these tests she presented to captive, 4-9 month old gulls a pair of open straw-coloured bowls each containing fish dyed in one of four colours. The highest response rate was scored for red (72%), the lowest rates were for green (38%) and blue (40%), yellow got an intermediate number of responses (51%). Thus, both experiments show a similarly high responsiveness to red as found in chicks. The responsiveness to blue, however, seems con- siderably lower. In the other experiments on food responses carried out by THOMPSON and ourselves, the food was not directly visible. Access to the food was easiest in an experiment designed by THOMPSON to test the effect of the colour of the substrate. Two small differently coloured dishes were side by side presented to the gulls on flat rectangles of 30 cm2, painted to match the colour of the dishes. Pieces of food were hidden behind the lip of the dish facing the direction from which the gull had to approach. In this experiment a peak was indicated at yellow-green, whereas the response rate to red, green, bluegreen and blue was low. However, com- bining these results with those of her tests with different grey shades, THOMPSON concludes that a genuine colour discrimination is not involv- ed, but that the bird preferably directs itself to the stimulus situation showing the smallest contrast with the background (light grey, 50% reflectance). She believes that in this way the gull is choosing for the least frightening situation. In our experiment on the effectiveness of differently coloured covers in selecting one of two bowls from which to take food (III.2.2.), green and brown were selected most, followed by yellow. The lowest response was for blue, with grey and red ranking on the 4th and 5th place. The results of the two experiments agree in that in the ap- proach of a potential source of hidden food, red and blue were not the most effective colours. Thus, the stimuli selected in exploratory pecking during searching for food are different from those most effective in peck- ing directly at food or at the parent's bill. Exploratory behaviour for obtaining food can lead to operant condi- tioning. THOMPSON developed a 'Skinner-box' technique in which the birds had to peck at one of four keys on a keyboard to obtain a food morsel. Discs in different colours or grey-shades could be screwed on the</page><page sequence="305">292 G. P. BAERENDS keys. Keyboards of three different shades were used: black, standard grey and white. During learning to peck at the keys one neutral grey shade was present on all keys. After the habit had been established the existence of spontaneous preferences for colours and grey shades was tested. Rewards were given after a certain number of pecks, in- dependently of the colour or shade to which the pecks were directed. The results varied with the shade of the background. With the standard grey background more pecks were directed at discs of intermediate than of longer or shorter wavelengths. Genuine colour discrimination was found to be involved. When the keys differed in grey shades only, preferences went to the highest contrast with the background grey. Pecking was highest for black, decreased towards the middle greys and rose again halfway towards white. With a black background a peak was found for yellow-green, a trough for green and intermediate values for the wavelength below 500 and above 575 mu. This picture could best be explained as due to the physiological brightness of the light received from the different colours. The responsiveness to the grey keys increased from black to white, thus with contrast as the criterion. With a white background the distribution of pecks to the different col- ours resembled the one found when the background was black, with the exception that all colours from yellow-green to red scored equal. This distribution cannot be attributed to a single criterion. Neither could- with the white background - consistency in the evaluation of the dif- ferent grey shades be found. This complicated picture suggests that in operant pecking at a key to ob- tain food, brightness criteria are primarily used (amount of reflected light and/or brightness contrast) and, if the light conditions are favourable, in addition wavelength criteria. In the latter case the effectiveness of middle wavelengths surpasses that of the longer and shorter ones, just as in the other experiments on indirect feeding responses dealt with above. Some further experiments by THOMPSON concern the manipulation (picking up, tossing, etc.) of different kinds of objects. In one instance eight cylinders (5.5 x 3.5 cm), either of different colour or of different shades of grey, or of a mixed combination of both, were simultaneously presented to juvenile herring and black-backed gulls. Towards colour the highest response rate was shown for intermediate wavelengths, the rate falling towards the longer and shorter ones. This was considered to reflect a real colour preference. Moreover, on the grey concrete floor, black and white were more often manipulated than the intermediate greys. Thus in</page><page sequence="306">GENERAL DISCUSSION 293 addition to the colour preference a brightness or contrast preference must also have played a role. Other objects for manipulation were paper strips (7.5 x 0.5 cm), even- ly painted in colour or grey and placed in groups of five, all of the same tone at 22 cm from the nest centre. Groups of different tones were presented successively. The behaviour of the gulls was not watched but after 10 hours it was noted whether each of the strips had been moved towards the nest, away from the nest, or had been left in situ. About 65% of strips of wavelengths below yellow, and also of brown and olive-green ones, were left in place; of those moved, about 30% was moved towards the nest and often manipulated as nest material and only 5% was moved away. In contrast about 20-30% of the yellow, orange and red strips had been moved towards the nest. More than 70% of the grey strips were left in situ, irrespective of shade, and if displaced this was only rarely away from the nest. A comparable series of experiments was carried out with three- dimensional rectangles, made from 3 x 10 cm metal strips and placed on the nest-rim at 18 cm distance from the centre of the nest. Of the blue and green strips 70% was kept in situ, circa 10% was moved towards and 20% away from the nest. Yellow-green angles were in 20% of the tests in which they were presented moved towards the nest, and in 30% carried away. For longer wavelengths, carrying away considerably increased to a peak of 65% for red (55% for purple), whereas for moving towards the nest the percentage decreased to almost zero for red. Grey painted metal angles received somewhat more attention when light than when dark, both for moving towards and for carrying away. THOMPSON attributes the differential responsiveness to the various colours to real wavelength discrimination. The results with paper strips and with metal angles agree in that most attention was paid to the longer wavelength and least to green. When taken, however, an angle had about twice as much chance to be carried away as a paper strip. Red angles had almost no chance of being moved towards the nest but red paper strips were put on the nest in 45% of the presentations. These differences must be due to features of the objects other than their hue. With the purpose of testing the responsiveness to colours in attack and escape situations THOMPSON used an apparatus which could be buried near to the nest and through which a tassel of coloured paper fringes could be raised for exposure to the incubating bird. The behaviour of the gulls was observed during the test and finally classified as: staying on the</page><page sequence="307">294 G. P. BAERENDS nest, leaving the nest for pecking at the dummy, and going away. The highest frequency for staying (40%) occurred when green or bluegreen tassels were shown; going away was most frequent for blue (80%), yellow-green, yellow and orange (70%) and purple (80%), and least fre- quent for green and red (55%). Pecking had a marked peak for red (40%), orange scored 15% and below that wavelength pecking was only rarely exhibited. Pecking was low for black and dark grey (10%) and had a value of 20% for white. The birds responded to grey tassels equally often by staying as by going away, irrespective of the shade of grey. It is clear from these experiments that green, the colour of the living vegeta- tion around the nest, is the least disturbing colour. All other colours are more likely to induce the bird to leave the nest; but in case of red colours this was nearly always to peck at the fringes and attack the dummy, in contrast to the reaction to the other colours, which led to avoidance of the area near the nest. The reactions to red so far discussed all have an element of attack in common: red painted eggs were frequently pecked at, the begging response is essentially an attack pattern, red objects are often removed from the area. The sole case of a red preference which need not directly be connected with attack concerns the only experiment in THOMPSON'S thesis which we have not yet brought up for discussion. Chicks which were stored in brown hardboard pens were singly placed in an arena with a grey floor and walls, on which either differentially painted panels (30 x 18 cm) could be affixed or on which differently coloured fields (20 x 16 cm) could be projected by means of interference and neutral density filters. The observer noted which colour or shade was approached by the chick. A clear and genuine preference for long wavelength was found with paints and with filters. Responsiveness to wavelength be- tween 550 and 470 mA was minimal and increased again for blue (to a larger extent in the filter than in the paint tests). With the grey series the strongest responses were for white and for black, those for the in- termediate greys were much lower. The results resemble very much those for the rate of pecking at dummies of the adult's bill. THOMPSON con- cludes that the chicks must be using the same perceptive mechanism when approaching the wall and when directing pecks at the parent's bill. IMPEKOVEN (1969) did similar experiments with black-headed gull chicks, using instead of painted walls evenly painted flat cardboard dum- mies, representing the posture of a gull calling its chicks. The colour preference of food-deprived chicks was almost the same for approach and for begging, with peaks for red and blue. However, blue led in pecking</page><page sequence="308">GENERAL DISCUSSION 295 and red in approach. One wonders whether this might be due to heterogeneous summation of the effect of colour on approach and the ef- fect of (low) brightness, which especially came out when the chick was cold and alarmed and tended to snuggling as soon as the dummy was reached. The blue tone used had a lower subjective brightness than the red one. A few more comments should be made concerning the three non- spectral hues: brown, olive-green and purple, which THOMPSON presented beside the spectral colours. Brown and olive-green are com- mon colours in the environment. Strips in these colours placed near the nest, were mostly ignored by the birds and in one third of the tests manipulated like nest material. Metal angles in these colours were handl- ed in half of the tests, but more often carried away (as in egg-shell removal) than worked into the nest. Shape is likely to account for this dif- ference. Cylinders in these colours were either moved into the nest or ig- nored. These reactions can all be understood on the basis of the resemblance of these colours with those of the natural adequate objects. Olive-green scored low in approach and begging and is not the colour of the chick's food. For an explanation of the much higher scores for brown, found for approach and begging (which corresponds with our findings with covered food bowls), further research would be necessary. Purple - a mixture of red and blue - scored high for approach and pecking for carrying away objects and for the frightening effect of the fringes. Purple scored low for food searching and for moving metal angles towards the nests. Thus the reaction to purple was usually similar to that to red; only for the response to the emerging tassel (where red induced pecking and purple going away) the reaction to purple resembled that to the blue component. The main purpose of the grey series was to distinguish genuine wavelength preferences from preferences for a certain brightness. Although for most responses a real colour effect was established, in a number of cases THOMPSON found in addition physiological brightness and light/dark contrast to play a role. Some of the results obtained in our experiments in the categories colour and speckling we were inclined to in- terpret similarly. In THOMPSON'S experiments bright paper strips and metal angles were more often displaced by the birds than dark ones; the former may have been most conspicuous on or near the nest. On a con- crete floor, black and white cylinders were more often manipulated than grey ones; this is certainly likely to be due to a contrast effect. More in- teresting, however, is that for the pecking rate of the chick and for its ap-</page><page sequence="309">296 G. P. BAERENDS proach of walls, both black and white obtained high response rates. THOMPSON considers this as adaptations to searching for dark hiding places and for the white parent bird, respectively. The first peck at the dummy in every bout, however, was considerably less often directed at white than at black, although more often at white than at the lighter greys. This picture for initial pecking is very similar to the picture we found for the responsiveness to black, grey shades and white in retrieval tests, with the dummies of our grey series (VI.2. and 3.), thus in an en- tirely different situation and functional context. In the black-headed gull IMPEKOVEN (1969) did not find this effectiveness of white dummies; but she found black to increase in effectiveness when the chicks became cold. Black even surpassed red and blue in effectiveness when the alarm call was played. In that case the effectiveness of the various colours entirely corresponded to their subjective brightness. One more study involving the effectiveness of colour for eliciting behaviour patterns in gulls should be brought up here. It is the study on egg shell removal in the black-headed gull, carried out by TINBERGEN and several collaborators (TINBERGEN et al., 1962a, 1962b, 1962c). This gull species takes considerable care in carrying egg-fragments away from the nest; as the investigators could show (TINBERGEN et al., 1962b) this behaviour reduces the chance of predators finding the recently hatched chicks. Experiments on the effect of colour in releasing the removal response were carried out with egg-shell dummies (TINBERGEN et al., 1962b). Most of these were made from 2 cm wide metal strips, pieces of 10 cm bent in the form of open rings ('small rings') and pieces of 5 cm bent as rectangles ('small angles'). The results are clear in that the response to green was relatively low, and lower for the brighter and more yellowish 'lettuce green' than for 'sage green', which showed only bet- ween 510 and 570 m/z a higher (10%) reflection than for the other wavelengths (20-30%). The data - although insufficiently extensive for a satisfactory comparison of the relative importance of different colours - indicate that the effectiveness of wavelength increases from green towards both ends of the spectrum, reaching a somewhat higher level at the longer than at the shorter wavelengths. A red colour with little reflec- tion in the shortwave range was relatively more often carried away by the birds than a red colour containing a considerable amount of blue (unfor- tunately these data are from different series of experiments, made in dif- ferent years). My impression from these data is that the response of the black-headed gull to coloured angles is of the same type as that of the her- ring gull to similar objects used by THOMPSON in one of her experiments</page><page sequence="310">GENERAL DISCUSSION 297 referred to above. Actually that herring gull experiment was inspired by the work on egg-shell removal in the black-headed gull, although in the former species egg-shell removal is only rarely seen. It is probably less functionally important in that species because the chicks after hatching do not stay long in the nest; commonly they take refuge elsewhere in bushes, grass tufts and holes in the relatively large territory. In competition with the above mentioned colours white scored higher; black scored relatively low. The authors consider white as a typical and essential element for the characterization of the adequate stimulus situa- tion (the inside of the open shell). The sage green hue used was originally meant to match the colour of the real eggs. In a later season the in- vestigators mixed a new 'natural colour', called khaki. Its reflection curve showed a small but steady increase from the shorter to the longer wavelengths and nothing like a peak in the green range. This khaki scored much higher than any of the other colours and was about equal to white. After black had been added to the same mixed paint, to reduce its reflection by about 50%, this dark khaki scored slightly higher than the original one, surpassing the score for white. The fact that the artificial colour best matching that of the natural egg shell was so highly effective inspired the investigators (TINBERGEN et al., 1962c) to study the influence of the colour of painted eggs incubated for a couple of weeks. In 60 nests the clutches were in the incubation period exchanged for black dummies and in 60 other nests for plain sage green ones, while another 60 nests re- tained their original clutches. Egg-shell removal tests with ring dummies showed that relatively more rings were carried away of those painted in the colour of the eggs incubated. By giving birds during the tests in the nest a clutch of a colour different from the one incubated, it was shown that the increased preference for carrying away shells of the 'foster col- our' was not due to similarity with the eggs present in the nest during the test, but to the experience gained during about 17 days incubation. It seems to me that the pattern of responsiveness to different colours found in these experiments can be understood as resulting from two sources of information, viz. knowledge of the real egg colour acquired from experience with eggs and a linkage of the removal response with a stimulus selection for long and short wavelength, independent of ex- perience with eggs and opposite to the effectiveness of various colours for evoking incubation responses. The effectiveness of white may also be in- dependent of experience with broken eggs. Unfortunately these sugges- tions cannot be tested, since the removal of egg-shells from nests is not feasible in birds which have never seen eggs.</page><page sequence="311">298 G. P. BAERENDS After this survey of the data available on the effectiveness of different colours and greyshades for releasing and/or directing various responses of larid and some closely related birds, we shall now try to answer the ques- tion which led to this compilation, viz. 'to what extent is the effectiveness of particular colours and shades response specific?' A schematical survey of the relative effectiveness of different colours for the various responses studied, summarizing the references given above, is presented in the Tables 85 and 86. It only takes into account gross differences in the spec- tral sensitivity of different responses, since I am of opinion that only such differences are suitable for comparison; the relative roughness and the variations in the techniques used in the different studies makes a com- parison of detailed differences unreliable. Let us first turn to the spectral colours. As already mentioned when briefly discussing the comparative data on the effectiveness of red, a peak TABLE 86a.

P. BAERENDS for the long wavelengths of the visual spectrum was found for a number of different motor patterns. A combined effectiveness for red and blue was found for begging and approach in chicks. These examples, which on the basis of the material referred to above can easily be extended by the reader, show that colour specificity, if present, reaches beyond an in- fluence on a single elementary act. We should therefore investigate whether it holds for groups of acts, perhaps for groups which also on other causal criteria, might be considered as representing behavioural systems. Taking the responses with a sensitivity peak for red, we find carrying away strips, egg-shell dummies, egg-dummies and pecking at tassels. This collection is suggestive for judging the responsiveness to red specific for a tendency to attack, expressed as jabbing at and pushing away the red object. Red is also a strong stimulus for food-begging in the chicks and for the approach of chicks to large objects. This seems consistent, since the motor pattern of food-begging is likely to have been derived from attack and the approach response can be seen as appetitive behaviour leading to begging. However, it is not consistent with the fact that the approach and begging responses of the chick were shown to have in addition a high sensitivity for blue not found for the attack responses. Consequently purple (a mixture of red and blue) obtained a high score for approach and begging responses, but not for attack. It suggests that for feeding responses peaks in red and blue are specific and for attack responses a peak in red. Unfortunately the absence of a blue peak in the spectral response curve of 4-9 month old herring gulls confronted with dyed fish is inconsistent with this suggestion. Neither blue nor red showed peaks for manipulative behaviour which led.to the discovery of food. Such behaviours (approach of food substrate, lifting cover of bowl and operant pecking with a standard grey background) showed peaks for the middle wavelength (yellow-green, 650 ma). A similar colour effectiveness was found for the manipulation of metal angles and cylinders resulting in the objects being moved towards the nest centre. One might conclude that a peak for the intermediate wavelengths is characteristic for activities implying exploration. It is remarkable that for all these activities, like those with peaks for red or red and blue, the effectiveness curve drops steeply at green (circa 550 my). Only for operant pecking with a grey background green scored high, the drop occurred at bluegreen (500 mit). It thus seems possible to reduce the differences between various behaviour patterns in their responsiveness to colour to 3 principles. 1) a peak in the median range of the</page><page sequence="314">GENERAL DISCUSSION 301 visual spectrum (yellow-green, 560 my) and low responsiveness at both ends, 2) a high effectiveness at both ends and a low one in the middle, 3) an increase of the responsiveness from the shorter towards the longer wavelengths. When the ac- tivities are grouped in accordance with the principles on which they are tuned in for their control, the resulting groups may also be characterized on the basis of other common factors which they share (see Part I.C.) and of subserving common functions. It is obvious to hypothesize that the linkage with one of these three colour selection principles is not specific for a single response but for a motivational system. IMPEKOVEN'S (1969) work on stimulus preferences in black-headed gull chicks indeed contains interesting indications for a control of motivation on the relative effectiveness of colours and grey shades when a behaviour is performed. Chicks in which the feeding and snuggling motivations had been manipulated, either by depriving them of food versus feeding them ad lib., or by keeping them warm versus letting them cool off, and also with or without playing the alarm calls of the adult birds, approached a red and a black bird dummy. However, a quantitative comparison of the reactions showed that hungry chicks responded far more often to red than black, although somewhat less often when they were cold and still less often when alarm calls were given. Alarm calls and cold thus stimulate the approach of the parent for taking cover instead of for feeding. In an experiment in which the effectiveness of red, yellow and green gull dummies was compared pairwise with that of light grey, dark grey and black ones, the percentages of choices for the colour depended on the colour tone, the shade of grey with which it was combined and the state (hungry, cold or alarmed) of the chick. For instance, for alarmed and for cold chicks the effectiveness of the grey shades in competition with all three colours decreased in the order: black-- dark grey- light grey; in hungry chicks no such regularity was found. In competition with red the scores for all greys were very low. When the chicks were alarmed yellow was almost ineffective in competition with all three greys; the respon- siveness to red and to green, however, was higher for red or green versus black (ca 50% and 33%, respectively) than for each of these colours against light grey (ca 70% and 9%, respectively). As mentioned above, chicks motivated to snuggle when confronted with a grey series display, besides the main peak for black, a secondary peak for white. In choice experiments with a white and a black dummy on grey backgrounds of different brightness, IMPEKOVEN found the pro- portion of approaches to the black and the white model to depend positively on the degree of contrast with this background. Against each</page><page sequence="315">302 G. P. BAERENDS background, however, hungry chicks showed a higher response percent- age to white than satiated cold ones. I think that on the basis of this evidence, and on our findings of the in- fluence of the quantitative relation between the tendencies to incubate and to escape (B/P-quotient) on the preference for particular features of an egg dummy, it may be concluded that activation of a motivational system sets the sensitivity for particular stimuli effective in releasing and /or directing the response subordinate to that system. The effects of simultaneous stimulation of more than one motivational system have played an important role in the explanation of several phenomena dealt with in this monograph. We may also expect such a motivational conflict to influence the picture of relative effectiveness of colours (as well as any set of elements in a stimulus situation). I am in- clined to explain in this way the results of THOMPSON'S experiment with the tassel, emerging near the nest of an incubating herring gull, from an apparatus buried in the ground. Of the 3 types of reactions of the bird that were measured, staying showed a peak for green and low values for blue and red, leaving showed peaks for blue and for yellow and low values for green and red, and pecking showed a peak for red. These reac- tions are explicable on the grounds that, of the spectral colours used, green is the least conspicuous one in the environment and thus probably relatively least disturbing. Blue, yellow and red are more alarming and thus likely to induce an escape response. Red, however, also evokes at- tack, the drop of the nest-leaving responses towards orange and red going hand in hand with the increase of attack responses. The experiments with series of grey shades were primarily made in order to distinguish genuine colour preference from preference for physiological brightness. However, they also revealed that, besides or in- stead of colour selection, selective sensitivity of a response or group of responses may occur to the amount of light reflected by an object, ir- respective of wavelength. The begging response was more often evoked by darker than by brighter dummies, both in the experiments of THOMPSON with herring gulls and of IMPEKOVEN with black-headed gulls. In our retrieval ex- periments dummies painted in a lighter grey (but white excepted) tended to be preferred over darker ones. In THOMPSON'S experiments the lighter grey metal angles (white included) were more often moved (away from as well as towards the nest) and in her 'tassel experiment' brighter fringes were more often pecked at than lighter ones. TINBERGEN et al. (1962a) found white to be an important stimulus for egg-shell removal. Stimulus</page><page sequence="316">GENERAL DISCUSSION 303 selection for high brightness (perhaps restricted by an upper limit) seems to play a role here, possibly subserving an attention-mechanism. Whether selection for colour, for physiological brightness or for brightness contrast occurs can apparently be controlled by the motiva- tional state. In addition, however, the shade of the background can be in- volved. This followed clearly from THOMPSON'S operant conditioning ex- periments, but similarly IMPEKOVEN (1969) has found that the preference for black in chicks begging or seeking for cover, switched towards white when the background of the dummies was made darker. b. Patterning. In 11.5 we have shown the superiority of speckled dummies over unspeckled ones in releasing and directing retrieval and settling responses. In herring gulls (IV.2.) as well as black-headed gulls (BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975) the preference for a speckling pattern was demonstrated also to exist in owners of cyanotic clutches. KOEHLER &amp; ZAGARUS (1937) have reported that in their experiments with ringed plovers speckled dummies were usually accepted, but unspeckled ones always refused. In agreement with our findings they also found the effec- tiveness of speckling to increase with the contrast of the spots against the background. TINBERGEN et al. (1962a) found that dots on an egg-shell model promote egg-shell removal; they did not further investigate the ef- fect of various properties of the dots, such as constrast or size. We found in our experiments small speckles to be more effective than large ones; we do not know of other reports on the effectiveness of the size of the speckles on eggs with respect to incubation behaviour. Dots or patches have also been found to play a role in releasing and directing begging responses. TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) found that, although the effectiveness of the patch on the yellow herring gull bill was augmented by its red colour, any patch contrasting in brightness with a medium grey bill exerted a stimulating effect. This effect increased with the degree of contrast between the bill and the patch, both when the patch was darker than the bill ('positive') as when it was lighter ('negative'). R. WEIDMANN (1956) did similar experiments with naive black-headed gull chicks. In spite of the fact that this gull has an entirely red bill, without a patch, she found a dummy with a white bill and a black spot at the end to be more effective than one with a fully red bill. On medium-grey bills the effectiveness of patches of various grey shades increased with their con- trast, like in the herring gull. With the same contrast 'positive' patches were more effective than 'negative' ones. Similarly HAILMAN (1967) has</page><page sequence="317">304 G. P. BAERENDS found that laughing gull chicks, hatched and reared in the dark respond with pecking to a spot, 7 mm in diameter, drawn on a card. Significantly more pecks were directed at a black spot on a white card than at a white spot on a black background. QUINE &amp; CULLEN (1964) have studied the release of pecking at various bill dummies in chicks of the arctic tern, which had been taken from the nests shortly before hatching and were tested in an incubator. In this species the parents feed their chicks with fish which is brought and presented while carried crosswise in the bill, head and tail of the fish hanging down on each side. The chicks pecked at the head of the fish, which they were found to distinguish from the tail on the basis of pattern- ing and not of overall shape. The responsiveness increased when a dot had been applied to the dummy and decreased when it showed a design of diverging stripes, suggestive of tail fin rays. Darker spots on a medium grey strip were more effective than brighter ones on the same strip. On a dummy consisting of a horizontal bar, representing the beak, with near to its end a shorter vertical blunt pointed bar (the hanging fish) the spot turned out to be most effective when applied on this vertical bar. When placed on the horizontal bar it also obtained a number of responses, which was higher when it was painted distally of the 'hanging fish' (thus at the end of the beak) than proximally. Surprisingly, in this type of dum- my a silver bill with a red fish ( + eye) proved to be more effective than a red bill with a silver dummy, a combination more closely resembling the natural one. In addition QUINE &amp; CULLEN did similar experiments with herring gull chicks. They found them more responsive to a beak with than without fish, although herring gulls seldom feed their chicks with intact fish. The herring gull chicks too responded more to the head than to the tail of a sandeel presented to them and correspondingly more at a dummy with eye spot than at one with a fin ray pattern. HORLYK &amp; LIND (1978) have presented to oystercatcher chicks simultaneously two bill dummies (7 x 0.5 cm, pointed end), one with a contrasting spot covering 9 mm of the tip and one without. A black tip on a red or on a green dummy, as well as a red tip on a black dummy, evok- ed many more responses than any plain coloured dummy. If we now compare the results obtained on the relative effectiveness of different spot features in incubation responses to eggs and in juvenile begging responses, agreement is found as far as the importance of con- trast is concerned, but disagreement exists with respect to size. For in- cubation, small sized speckles are more effective, for feeding responses the effectiveness increases with size.</page><page sequence="318">GENERAL DISCUSSION 305 Our experiments with adult gulls on spontaneous stimulus selection in a novel, artificial, feeding situation (111.2.2.) were undertaken to find out whether the preferences for features found in the egg-retrieval ex- periments would hold in general. They included eight types of tests on speckling; in all of them a choice was given between two food-containing bowls, each covered with a differently patterned square piece of card- board. The results have been summarized in Table 74 (see also Plate XVII); they differ considerably from those obtained on egg retrieval. First, covers with spots equally distributed over their entire surface were not preferred over plain painted ones. Second, a difference in the respon- siveness to large and small speckles was only found when a few large spots, evenly distributed over the cover, were given in competition with many small spots. In contrast with the result obtained for incubation responses, the few large speckles were more often chosen first. We must conclude that the responsiveness to dots in the incubation situation is essentially different from that in the begging or feeding situa- tions. It seems to me that the former can best be understood as a response to an entire object, and the latter to a detail of an object. Thus, many small speckles would make the relatively large object attractive; one or a few large spots would direct the attention to a particular area of an object. This would make it understandable that in the choice between the two covers the attention of the bird would be drawn towards the conspicuous large spots, more than to an evenly dotted pattern. It would also explain why, when the spots are replaced by an entire egg-dummy attached to the centre of the cover, or by a flat area of the size of an egg, filled with spots (exp. II and III in Table 74), the attention is more often drawn to the cover marked with the most attractive dummy or dummy-pattern. In this conception the dummy pattern is thought to act as an attractive spot. This attractiveness could be due to the interrupted (checkered) pattern of the restricted area on which black occurs. Such an increase of the effec- tiveness of a patch by disrupting it was achieved by TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) in their attempts to construct a supernormal red bill patch (see V.6.). PETERS (1953) also found the responsiveness of herring gull chicks to figures presented to them on a card to increase with the complexity of the design. Possible causes for the attractiveness of a com- pound or disrupted pattern will be discussed in the next chapter. It will be clear from the above that the two types of sensitivity for spots, as identified above, are not specific for a single response but rather for a group of responses, thus probably for motivational systems.</page><page sequence="319">306 G. P. BAERENDS c. Size. We can conceive of three possible principles in which information about the size of an object, or part of it, could be present in an animal. It could be determined as: 1) a range between two limits, 2) larger than a lower limit, and 3) smaller than a lower limit. Size itself might be evaluated in an absolute sense, or some form of scaling might take place of either the relations between different dimen- sions of the object or its relations to another object. The second principle was found for the effectiveness of objects in evok- ing incubation responses; resulting in a practically unlimited increase of the effectiveness of an egg-dummy with its size. In contrast, the first prin- ciple, fixation within a range, was found to hold for attempts to feed on egg-dummies laid out for robbing herring gulls on roosts (IV.2.1.). Most feeding pecks were directed at dummies of the normal size (code 8). Size 6 came second and size 10 third; larger sizes were mostly ignored. For the egg-shell removal response TINBERGEN et al. (1962a) found large ring-shaped egg-shell dummies to have a lower chance of being car- ried away than small rings. At first sight one might conclude that in this case the third principle - a fixed upper limit - would apply. However, since the authors observed in the black-headed gulls more often fear responses towards the larger dummies, they are inclined to think that the upper size limit is set because another tendency (to escape or to avoid) is interfering with the tendency to remove egg-shells. This interpretation is similar to our explanation of the occurrence of consistent minority choices in the category size and, in fact, was inspired by it. However, looking for a better example of the third principle in the literature about the responsiveness of gulls, the importance of narrowness in the begging response of chicks appears as a candidate. With a series of dummies of different width, TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) obtained in herring gull chicks the highest response ratio for the smallest diameter (5 mm). In contrast, HAILMAN (1967) found for laughing gull chicks a response optimum for a width of 8 mm. Moreover he refers to an un- published paper read in 1959 by U. WEIDMANN in which the latter reported to have found a similar optimum in naive chicks of the black- headed gull. An optimum would follow from the first principle. A preference for begging at the object with the smallest diameter was also found by PETERS (1953) in herring gull chicks to whom he presented pairs of discs of different diameter (200, 125, 70 and 15 mm) attached at right angles to the end of rods, and in various combinations. The highest</page><page sequence="320">GENERAL DISCUSSION 307 percentage of responses was obtained by the 15 mm disc which, however, outsized three times the diameter of the thinnest rod used by TINBERGEN and PERDECK. One might ask whether the high effectiveness for evoking begging in herring gull chicks of a dummy with an elongated narrow bill (like the bill of a godwit), reported by TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950), is due to a predetermined positive relation between effectiveness and size. These authors indeed found that an extension with the height of a herring gull bill, from a red disc of roughly the same surface as the herring gull's head, received more pecks when this projection had the length of the bill than when it was about one third as long. However, an oversized bill of normal thickness, about as long as the 'godwit bill', did not obtain more responses than the normal one. It is therefore likely that the high response rate to the godwit bill was only due to it also having a small width (a point discussed below) but not to its greater length. Unfor- tunately, a thin bill of normal length was not presented for comparison. In the black-headed gull, R. WEIDMANN (1956) did not find an effect of bill length. In the preceding discussion on the effectiveness of spots we have sug- gested that for some responses an increase of effectiveness with increasing size (principle 2) and for others which decreasing size (principle 3) has been laid down. The former holds for the positive correlation between ef- fectiveness and size of a black patch (either surrounded by an orbital ring to make it an eye patch or not) on a white strip for evoking the begging response in arctic terns. The latter holds for the speckling pattern on the eggs and it explains why we found in some pilot experiments a clear preference for dummies with only speckles of 1 mm diameter, widely distributed (a very unnatural pattern) over plain coloured egg dummies. d. Shape. A variety of features of an object may be classified in the category shape: whether the object is a solid, the number of dimensions involved and the proportions between them, the outline, roundness or angularity, and the texture. Between parts of the object and between the object and its posi- tion in space configurational relations may exist, when in rest as well as when moving. For a dummy to be treated as an incubating object it has to be three- dimensional and solid. This is not so for egg-shell removal in the black- headed gull. Flat rectangles with a surface of 9 cm2 had a high chance of being removed as long as the ratio between length and width was about</page><page sequence="321">308 G. P. BAERENDS 2:1 or less. If this ratio was exceeded the chance increased that they were treated as food or nest material. The decision often seemed to be taken after the gull had picked up the object and 'mandibulated' it (TINBERGEN et al., 1962a). Neither the hollowness of the shell nor the missing cap in its outline were found to stimulate egg-removal, but they practically exclud- ed retrieval (TINBERGEN et al., 1962c). In addition egg-shel removal was found to be more specifically elicited by the edge of the open shell frag- ment being thin and serrated, and by the white fringes shown near this edge. In the herring gull we found roundness of a dummy to be important for evoking egg-retrieval and nest-attendance. In the black-headed gull TINBERGEN et al. (1962a, b) found metal angles less effective in stimulating egg-shell removal than rings. Thus, roundness also promotes the release of this response. In the stimulus situation releasing and directing the begging response in gull chicks features of shape were also found to be effective elements. A representation of the bill is very important. A flat cardboard dummy of head plus bill, painted in the natural pattern and colours of the species (standard dummy), did not significantly differ in effectiveness from a dummy of the bill only when presented to naive chicks (herring gull, TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK, 1950; black-headed gull, R. WEIDMANN, 1956; laughing gull, HAILMAN, 1967). In the laughing gull a head without bill obtained about 25% of the number of responses evoked by the standard dummy. Neither TINBERGEN and PERDECK, nor HAILMAN found a significant ef- fect of the shape of the bill tip, but HAILMAN states that U. WEIDMANN (in the unpublished paper just mentioned) reported to have found in the black-headed gull a preference for a rounded over a pointed bill. With respect to relational properties the spatial position of the bill was found to be important. In the experiments of TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) a dummy held vertical scored highest, a horizontal one lowest and an oblique one received an intermediate number of responses. R. WEID- MANN (1956) found the same for the black-headed gull. In contrast QUINE &amp; CULLEN (1964) found in arctic terns a preference for a horizontal posi- tion of the bill dummy. In herring gulls as well as arctic terns more reac- tions were obtained when the dummy was moved horizontally than ver- tically. HAILMAN (1967) found an optimum for the speed of movement which corresponded with the speed at which the parent laughing gull ac- tually moves its bill in front of its chicks.</page><page sequence="322">GENERAL DISCUSSION 309 When TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) presented a red disc without ex- tension to herring gull chicks, they directed their pecks towards the lowest point. Lowness also appeared to be important for directing pecking responses in experiments in which two bill dummies were simultaneously presented, one below the other. PETERS (1953) demonstrated this preference with a board triangle presented frontally on a rod in different orientations. Pecks were chiefly directed to the lowest situated corner of the dummy. When this author presented a vertical rod to 2-4 days old chicks, the lower end was highly preferred; HORLYCK &amp; LIND (1978) found the same for oystercatcher chicks. But when PETERS tried the her- ring gull chicks again when they were 10-15 days old the middle zone of the rod obtained most of the responses, those to the higher parts had also increased, whereas the lower end received by far the smallest number of responses. In a number of these experiments lowness also implied nearness and the latter in itself was found to be very effective (see below). However, the results of an experiment in which lowness and nearness were put into competition (the lower rod further away from the chick than the upper one) argue for an effectiveness of lowless on its own ac- cord. When PETERS (1953) presented to herring gull chicks a dummy con- sisting of a larger disc (4 cm diam.) to the edge of which a smaller disc (15 cm diam.) was attached (both discs in the same plane which was shown frontally to the chick) the protruding small disc received about as many pecks as the main disc with its much larger surface. The small disc was equally often pecked at when the dummy was presented with this protru- sion downwards or sidewards, but the amount of pecks to the small disc in the upward position was considerably smaller. The amount of responses to the protruding disc could be halved by applying a pattern of concentric circles to the centre of the large disc. This centrally placed at- tention attracting stimulus could obviously compete with the peripheral one. At this point we have arrived at the question whether the responses of naive chicks to some characters of shape or spatial orientation should be considered as evidence for sensitivity to particular configurational features in such chicks. TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) found a much lower response of herring gull chicks to a dummy in which the red patch had been placed on the forehead than to the standard dummy with the patch near the end of the bill. They interpreted this preference as a response to a configurational feature and - as will be discussed in V.5 - drew im- portant theoretical conclusions from it. SCHNEIRLA (1956) expressed</page><page sequence="323">310 G. P. BAERENDS doubt as to the correctness of this interpretation, arguing that with iden- tical movement of both dummies the patches would move at different speed so that the chicks discriminate on this difference instead of on the difference in configuration between the dummies. HAILMAN (1967) has proved the correctness of this suggestion. When he moved the two types of dummies in such a way that the patches were swept over equal arcs at the same speed (by adjusting the pivoting points of the dummies correspon- dingly) he indeed obtained equal pecking rates from the chicks. This example shows how careful one should be in concluding that sen- sitivity to configuration is involved in the responsiveness to a visual stimulus situation. With respect to the question whether such a sensitivity might occur in chicks which never had been confronted with the releasing situation or with one comparable to it, one should be aware that the in- formation available on the experience the experimental chicks might already have obtained, is often unsatisfactory. Some authors used chicks hatched and reared in the dark, but often in more than one test. Others took chicks from the nest before they were fully dried; but occasional observations of chicks begging when still wet (R. WEIDMANN) throw doubt on the safety of this procedure. Finally in some studies chicks were kept together in the light. Responsiveness to configurations does occur in experienced birds. HAILMAN (1967) has shown that herring gull chicks living in the wild with their parents show a distinct preference for a 'mandibular' over a 'forehead' patch, irrespective of the speed of movement. He also showed in the laughing gull that the responsiveness to features of shape is much greater after the chicks have had an opportunity to gain experience. In 3-14 day old wild reared chicks he found a distinct influence of the shape of head and bill and a gradual development of knowledge of shape- characteristics of the own species, using the same dummies which in fully naive chicks failed to induce differential pecking rates. Summarizing the evidence of the role of features of shape in evoking specific responses in naive chicks we must conclude that abstract physical characteristics, such as number of dimensions involved, solid vs hollow, roundedness vs angularity, vertical vs horizontal, above vs below, etc. can be effective properties for releasing and/or directing a specific response or more often a specific group of responses. In contrast the evidence makes it likely that naive chicks do not possess a more detailed knowledge about the more complicated characters of shape of objects they are responding to, such as the typical tapered shape of an egg, the exact shape of the bill of adult conspecifics, or of the outline of their head.</page><page sequence="324">GENERAL DISCUSSION 311 Sensitivity for a simple shape characteristic may be effective with respect to one response, but ineffective for another, despite its presence in the adequate object. e. Conclusion. From the survey of data on stimulus selection in larid birds given in this chapter I think that the following conclusions may be drawn. 1. Whenever there is reason to assume that the linkage between a par- ticular response and a particular stimulus situation is present without previous experience with that situation, the response is evoked by a relatively small number of different stimuli each representing only a single simple characteristic of that situation (spectral colour, amount of light reflected, contrast against background, dimensionality, contour lines, etc.). 2. The same set of stimuli was often found to be involved in more than one response, all of which on other grounds could be considered to belong to the same motivational system. 3. Responses reckoned to different motivational systems are linked with different sets of stimuli; some overlap, however, may occur. 4. The set of stimuli releasing and/or directing a homologous response or group of responses in related species was often found to be identical or very similar. 5. The animal possesses a wider range of sensory capacities than is needed for the perception of each single stimulus set of the type mention- ed under 1-3. 6. Whenever the stimulus-response linkage was found to depend on a set of stimuli, and in particular on relationships between stimuli, it could be argued that this knowledge of the situation was likely to be due to ex- perience. Stimulus-response relationships should enable the animal to react ade- quately to the external situation and thus help avoid the occurrence of responses which are functionally erroneous. This raises the problem in how far the sensitivity of groups of responses for particular stimuli, as found above, can be considered adaptive. Most of the authors who studied the situation releasing or directing a response of adult and juvenile larid birds have tried to answer this question. This will be the subject of the next chapter.</page><page sequence="325">CHAPTER 2 ON THE ADAPTIVENESS AND THE NATURE OF STIMULUS SELECTION IN LARID BIRDS LORENZ'S original concept of the innate releasing scheme contained the suggestion that the underlying mechanism - specific for the species as well as for the response - would be located as a unit in the central ner- vous system, between the receptors and the units controlling motor ac- tivity. This easily led to the preconception, usually not explicitly express- ed but nevertheless underlying the approach and design of experimental studies, that these mechanisms should all function in the same way and correspondingly have the same unitary structure irrespective of the species or the response concerned. The conclusion drawn from PRECHTL'S (1952, 1953) study of stimulus specific decrement of the beg- ging response in passerines, that predictions of the chance of a particular activity to occur should no longer be made only on basis of the strength of the external stimulation and of the internal motivational state, but in ad- dition on the degree of adaptation (in the neurophysiological sense) of the IRM (triple quantification) is an illustration of this way of thinking. SCHNEIRLA (1952, 1956) and LEHRMAN (1953) were the first to point to the dangers involved in thinking in terms of such an idealized concept. They warn for instance against identifying releasing mechanisms mainly according to the observer's appraisal of the behavioural relation of an animal to the situation of occurrence, thinking in terms of a preformed mechanism and assuming isomorphic correspondence between that mechanism and the complex of sign stimuli involved. Although their criticism was partly directed at conclusions they had drawn themselves from ethological writings and which sometimes went farther than what was actually meant, the essence should be taken to heart in any further analysis of the stimulus selection phenomenon. In particular SCHNEIRLA and LEHRMAN advocated considering the possibilities of specific capacities as well as constraints of the receptors before postulating more centrally localized filter mechanisms, and thus to follow rules of parsimony in searching for causal explanation of stimulus selection. MARLER (1961) seconded the plea for this approach in a critical discussion of the relevant data at that time available in the literature. In this chapter I shall also try to follow this approach with respect to the gull data. The first step will be a consideraton of the degree of adaptation</page><page sequence="326">GENERAL DISCUSSION 313 achieved in matching specific responsiveness to characteristics of the ade- quate external situation. The next step will try to see in how far imperfec- tion of adaptation - the presence of which was already noticed in the preceding chapter - could be ascribed to constraints following from the system receiving and processing visual information in the gulls. The third step will try to interpret the physiological background of these con- straints. This last step should lead to insight in how the filtering underly- ing stimulus selection might be brought about. We may expect this to be in the first place due to the way the sensory pathways of the gulls general- ly fulfil their various functions, a way which must have evolved as a compromise to the demand of these functions. In addition we should look for devices of how adaptations to special releasing functions could have been built in. It is hoped that this approach will also lead to suggestions of how responsiveness to features of the external situation might be genetically encoded. As in the previous chapter the discussion will be organized according to the four principal stimulus categories distinguished throughout this study. a. Colour. In all gull species studied incubation responses were found to be linked with colours of medium wavelength, peaking in yellow-green. Repulsive-, attack- or feeding responses in adults were linked with col- ours of long wavelength, peaking in red. Food begging chicks of all gulls and terns studied showed the highest pecking rates towards red and blue billed dummies. These peaks cannot be said to closely correspond with the natural col- ours of the objects adequate in these functions. A comparison of Figs 18 and 19a shows that the green colour highly preferred by the herring gulls in our egg-retrieval experiments resembled the real colours of the eggs of this species much less than the brown colour which was usually rated below green. Although the eggs of black-headed gulls tend on the average more towards green than those of herring gulls, in egg-retrieval tests birds of the former species only rarely exhibited a green preference, they mostly preferred the brown dummy (BAERENDS &amp; VAN RHIJN, 1975). Red is not a colour representative for the food of gulls. Actually the col- our of food varies with the species and the habitat, and further with the age and food habits of the individual bird. In herring gulls most of the food is whitish or brownish, certainly when it is regurgitated by the</page><page sequence="327">314 G. P. BAERENDS parent to feed the young. A number of worm species eaten appear rosa, but the kind of red found effective in the experiments the gulls are only likely to find in carrion when fresh and torn open. The food brought by the parent to feed the chicks is usually discoloured when regurgitated. However, the inside of the bill of the parents is red and in several species also the outside, or parts of it. Only in this respect can the effectiveness of red be called adaptive for directing the food beg- ging response. However, the linkage of the high responsiveness of food begging to long wavelengths with a roughly equally high responsiveness to short wavelengths (blue) is very difficult to interpret as adaptive, especially in gulls. The laughing gull bill does not reflect blue (HAILMAN, 1967). In terns, as QUINE &amp; CULLEN (1964) have pointed out, bluish col- ours occur in the fish carried intact in the bill, to the chicks. Still, the kind of blue preferred by the arctic tern chicks in the experiments of these authors did not very well match with the colour of the fish actually sup- plied. As an argument in favour of the functional relevance of the sen- sitivity for blue when the feeding motivation is activated, QUINE and CULLEN mentioned that the ratio between the response rates for blue and red found for terns was, in comparison with gulls, shifted towards blue. However, data collected since by IMPEKOVEN (1969) show a pecking rate for hungry black-headed chicks which is similar to that found by QUINE and CULLEN for the arctic tern. I am afraid that the problem cannot be resolved on the present data alone; the data from different authors as well as from different species are too difficult to compare in the details re- quired, because of differences in the circumstances of the experiments and the motivational states of the birds. THOMPSON'S (1970) experiments have demonstrated a peak in yellow- green for the inducement of behaviour patterns which could be func- tionally classified as exploratory. Gulls perform exploratory behaviour when searching for nestmaterial in the vegetation around the nest, or for food in the tidal zone among seaweed and various debris washed ashore. Part of the behaviour shown towards eggs can also be classified as ex- ploratory behaviour. Most of the material concerned in exploration is brownish, yellowish or greenish. These are mixed colours, but they come closer to the spectral colours of medium wavelength than to the longer or shorter ones. Thus a higher responsiveness of exploratory behaviour for medium wavelength would yield an approximate adaptation. Since the luminosity curve for the gulls also peaks in the medium wavelengths, one might ask whether conspicuous subjective brightness would be the factor evoking the exploratory response. However, by means of her series of</page><page sequence="328">GENERAL DISCUSSION 315 grey shades THOMPSON could show that at least in a number of ex- ploratory responses genuine colour preference was involved. We must conclude that the linkage of functional groups of responses with particular ranges of the spectrum cannot be considered as more than very roughly adapted. The hypothesis that adaptive selection for these ranges has occurred is only acceptable on the assumption that the possibilities offered for selection by the substrate were severely limited. One of the constraints seems to have been that adaptation to relatively narrow ranges of the spectrum was excluded, another that no adaptation was possible to colour tones resulting from mixtures of non-adjacent wavelengths. If these possibilities were available one would expect a much closer match of the responsiveness to colours. However, given these constraints, a positive linkage of feeding responses with red com- bined with an inhibition to act with feeding towards green fits a non- herbivorous animal better than the reverse. In contrast, for incubation green is the better alternative. HAILMAN (1964, 1967) was first in arriving at the conclusion that one should no longer try to explain the curiously high sensitivity of the beg- ging response for blue as an adaptation to some bluish element in the feeding situation, but that one should see it as a consequence of the way the visual system functions. A step towards this approach, however, had already been made by R. WEIDMANN (1956) and U. WEIDMANN (1961) who explained the striking difference between the high responsiveness of black-headed gull chicks to Ostwald blue 13 (almost equal to the response to red) and the much lower reaction to blue 16, as due to the filter capaci- ty of yellow oil droplets in the cones. Both papers reflect a considerable amount of red light, but in contrast to blue 16, which reflects large amounts of green and blue-green light which cannot be filtered out by the oil droplets, blue 13 reflects much smaller quantities of these wavelengths so that through the filter effect of the droplets blue 13 is likely to appear red to the bird. However, when later HAILMAN showed that a relatively high pecking rate was also evoked by a narrow bandwidth of blue light, it became clear that the explanation of the WEIDMANN'S could not general- ly suffice. An explanation was needed for the combination of high respon- siveness to long and short wavelength and a low responsiveness to medium ones; the bimodal U-pattern. At that time not more than one phototopic pigment had been found in the cones of birds (chicken and pigeon). Consequently HAILMAN also in- corporated the filtering effect of oil droplets in a theory of how different wavelengths would be coded. Differently coloured droplets will filter dif-</page><page sequence="329">316 G. P. BAERENDS ferent parts of the spectrum of the incoming light before finally reaching the same pigment. The gulls possess red and yellow droplets and HAILMAN assumed interaction between the effects of both in coding the wavelength preference for pecking; the red droplets he assumed to be pre- sent in excitatory cones and the yellow droplets in inhibitory ones. On the basis of the transmission spectra of both types of droplets and the assumption that the interaction between their effects is multiplicative, HAILMAN computed the expected spectral response curve for begging. It closely matched the one experimentally found. As pointed out by HAILMAN this interaction hypothesis does not only explain the red-blue preference in begging but it can also account for a yellow-green preference, its mirror image, such as found by us for egg- retrieval, nest-attendance and the recovery of visually hidden food (cf. BAERENDS &amp; KRUIJT, 1973). However, it does not explain the unimodal peak found for egg-robbing by us and for dyed food by THOMPSON. The following consideration may help to solve the problem. Since HAILMAN postulated his model considerably more knowledge has been gained about the mechanism of colour vision, in particular through in- tracellular recording of potentials from the retina. In several higher and lower vertebrates the existence of trichromacity colour perception by means of three different photopic pigments, has been established. In vertebrates as taxonomically distant as goldfish and macaques, colour coding systems have been found which are based on three different pigments, with absorption peaks in blue, green and red (yellow), respec- tively, and which through a number of different excitatory and inhibiting connections with cells further upstream in the retina (in particular the horizontal cells) form a number of colour opponent process mechanisms in Hering's sense. Here the signals from the cones are transformed to graded responses which are depolarizing for some wavelengths and hyper- polarizing for others. Such chromaticity potentials have been found in five different patterns viz.: 1) depolarization by red and hyperpolariza- tion by green, and 2) vice versa; 3) depolarization by green and hyper- polarization by blue, and 4) vice versa; 5) depolarization by red and blue and hyperpolarization by green (but not vice versa). The transformations in the opponent process mechanisms are a step in the further analysis and extraction of information taking place more centrally (HuRVICH, 1973; DE VALOIS, 1973; KAUFMAN, 1974; GRUBER, 1979). Beside these chromaticity potentials luminosity potentials have been found which hyperpolarize to all wavelengths and characterize other op- ponent process mechanisms for subjective brightness sensations.</page><page sequence="330">GENERAL DISCUSSION 317 The gull data appear to fit this view. Mechanism (5) could explain the bimodal curve for begging, mechanism (1) the preference for red in feeding responses and the mechanisms (2) and (3) the preference for green and the low values for red and blue in dealing with eggs. Only the complicated course of the wavelength sensitivity distribution for egg-shell removal is difficult to fit into either of the theories. This may be due to the effects of learning processes (such as probably reflected in the difference between green and khaki; see p. 299) and of interactions between dif- ferent motivations (for instance with respect to red). Unfortunately, as yet unsufficient clarity exists about the application of the theory of colour opponent mechanisms in birds. However, although the analysis of the visual pigments in the cones of birds meets with con- siderable technical difficulties the idea that birds would have one photopic pigment cannot be maintained. First, spectral sensitivity curves with peaks at about 480, 550 and 610 mgt have been obtained by DONNER (1953) by tapping off action potentials from the ganglion cell layer of the pigeon retina. Second, IKEDA (1965) found data corresponding with two of these curves with electro-retinograms, after light-adaptation to isolate the cone from the rod response. Third, GRANDA &amp; YAZULLA (1971) found electrophysiologically peak sensitivities for ca 540 and 610 mi in cells of the nucleus rotundus of the pigeon. DELIUS and his collaborators have entertained the possibilities of models based on trichromaticity for explaining selective behavioural responsiveness to colours in gulls and pigeons. Using methods of operant conditioning EMMERTON &amp; DELIUS (1980) found evidence for the presence of at least three but probably 5 modulators for colour perception in pigeons. DELIUS &amp; THOMPSON (1970) were of the opinion that a mechanism consisting of a red sensitive and a blue sensitive modulation unit connected with a high gain link with the response mechanism, and a green unit connected with a low gain link, would explain this pattern. However, this model could not account for the observations that the response to red was hardly affected by intensity differences whereas the responsiveness to green (and also white) was stronger at high than at in- termediate ones. Postulation of an inhibiting effect of the scotopic rods on the green system could cope with this complication. DELIUS, THOMPSON, ALLEN &amp; EMMERTON (1972) have tried two types of trichromatic models as alternatives to the HAILMAN model in an attempt to explain the results of experiments in which neonate gull chicks were offered a choice between each of the spectral colours red, green and blue and a colour produced by the mixture of two of these. The preference predicted by each of the</page><page sequence="331">318 G. P. BAERENDS models showed a different pattern. None of them fully agreed with the preferences empirically found, but the agreement with the trichromatic models was better than that with the original HAILMAN model. These authors tend to the belief that the preferences found are not due to af- ferent sensory filtering mechanisms but rather to more central postperceptual processes. Whatever the way in which the colour sensitivity of the photoreceptor cells is brought about, both hypotheses agree in that at a stage upstream of the actual receptors neurons are intercalated in the information pro- cessing chain, which can be considered as detectors or analyzers for dif- ferent types of spectral distributions. For which particular type a neuron is sensitive depends on the type of connections it has with the receptor cells. It is obvious that at this stage of the argument the question arises whether the rough adaptation to colours encountered above for different responses in naive larid birds, as well as the occurrence of the apparently unadapted sensitivity of the begging response to blue, might be explained by assuming connections between these detectors and the mechanisms for the motor control of these responses (or groups of responses). If the on- togenetical development of such a connection would be programmed in the genes, a link between a particular response and a roughly defined stimulus would be present in an individual, in spite of its lack of ex- perience with the adequate situation. This need not exclude that ex- perience later obtained concerning more details about colour, and possibly facilitated by the existence of this primary link, may be incor- porated. In that process more elaborate colour-analysing mechanisms, situated centrally from the detectors in the information processing path, are likely to play a part. In the following I shall use the term 'primary S-R link' for the mechanism enabling an animal to respond in a specific way to a stimulus constellation, representing the situation adequate for that particular response, without the use of knowledge acquired through experience with that adequate situation. The term is not meant to exclude separate ex- perience with stimuli which are components of this situation. If ex- perience with the adequate situation is or may be involved the adjective'primary' will be omitted. A combination of sophisticated physiological and ethological techni- ques in interdisciplinary research is needed to check these ideas and to develop them further. I am confident that such research will show the ap- proach, started and pursued by HAILMAN (1964, 1967, 1969, 1970,</page><page sequence="332">GENERAL DISCUSSION 319 1971), to analyze the nature of the S-R linkages concerned in a framework of sensory physiology, ontogeny, genetic coding and adapta- tion, most fruitful to come to a real understanding of how in a number of concrete cases LORENZ'S IRM-concept is in fact physiologically and anatomically realized. Insight in the physiological basis of the crude adaptedness of the effect of various colours on different groups of responses does not yet explain why such roughly adapted primary S-R links function in animals (also when adult) that are on the other hand perfectly able to differentiate be- tween slight differences in hue. Recall the example of the black-headed gulls distinguishing their own clutch from a differently coloured one. Our findings on the influence of motivation on the kind of criteria used to decide between the two dummies presented on the nest-rim provides us with a cue to the solution of this problem. Features, corresponding in detail to the natural object, were only taken into account when the gull postponed its decision because it was afraid. This knowledge of details was likely to have been acquired through experience with the adequate object. In contrast, the roughly adapted S-R links were found and studied either in naive birds, as yet unfamiliar with the appropriate ob- ject, or in unfrightened birds, responding quickly (in the egg-rolling ex- periments) and apparently without retrieving information from their memories. Therefore sensitivity to a rough colour code is a way in which informa- tion about environmental cues can be genetically stored. It can be part of a link in the procedure by which information about stimulus situations vital to an animal and present in its genes is generated. I hypothezise that through genetically programmed ontogenetic processes the primary S-R links are formed as connections between specialized detectors in the sen- sory organs and control units of motoric behaviour (of different order) of either an excitatory or an inhibitory nature. Provided the connections are set to pick up some characteristic features of each of the relevant stimulus situations, a relatively small number of such connections is likely to suf- fice to prevent serious ambiguity. Since each feature can be taken to be among its kind the one best typifying the stimulus situation, hetero- geneous summation is a suitable way for combining the information (almost) simultaneously received from the different cues involved. In addition, it is also conceivable that different cues characterizing an object impinge on the responding animal successively, eliciting a response chain.</page><page sequence="333">320 G. P. BAERENDS The hypothesis implies that for the genetical codification of the primary S-R link serving a response or group of responses, out of the five different wavelength distributions available one has to be selected. In this process a solution will be favoured which fits best the stimulus situation in the natural environment by which the response concerned should be evoked. When in the same species functionally different responses should have primary S-R links with wavelength patterns, the distribution finally selected for each of them is likely to have a compromise character. Am- biguousness should be avoided. As a consequence of this one may expect species or taxonomical groups with different habits or living in different environments to have selected different wavelength distributions for functionally the same kind of responses, or - reversely - the same distribution for functionally dif- ferent responses, depending on how well a distribution matches the ade- quate situation. With this in mind it is interesting to compare the S-R links found in the Laridae with those found in other groups of birds. KEAR (1964) has studied colour preference in recently hatched young of several species of anatid birds, pecking at transparent coloured spots. This pecking can be called spontaneous; it was not preceded by a specific training and no reward was given. A distinct preference for green, sometimes combined with a high score for yellow and, less often, for blue-green was common to the ca 40 species tested. With some exceptions the scores for red, orange and blue were much lower. Taxonomic sub- groups of the Anatidae showed differences in the extent to which these colours were avoided. With the same technique some species of other bird families were also tested: 3 species of Phasanidae were found to have a preference similar to that of the ducks and geese, 2 species of gulls prefer- red red and orange, and so did 2 species of Rallidae. Unfortunately the experimental set up did not allow a separation of the effects of colour and of brightness. The preference for green in young Anatidae can be seen as more suited to lead them towards the right kind of food than a red preference, since their food - whatever it may be - is more likely to be present in a green vegetation than to be associated with red. Nevertheless, it is striking that spectral sensitivity distributions of func- tionally the same responses in different species can often be understood less well on the basis of species-specific food preference than on the systematic position of the bird. The principal result of KEAR'S study, the preference for green in the pecking response of young Anatidae, was confirmed by OPPENHEIM (1968) in a study on peking and mallard ducklings in which the effect of</page><page sequence="334">GENERAL DISCUSSION 321 brightness was controlled. Moreover this author has shown that this real colour preference is independent of previous visual experience and can- not be experimentally modified by exposing embryos or newly hatched ducklings to coloured light. A similar independance of previous ex- perience was found by FISCHER, DAVIS &amp; NORD (1974) for white leghorn chicks. In these birds, however, green received the lowest amount of pecks and peaks were found for orange and blue, a result thus com- parable with that in larid birds. A preference for red over yellow, blue and green (of equal reflecting percentages as measured by a photographic lightmeter) and over black and white (all against a white background) had also been found by CRONHELM (1970) for domestic chicks a few days old, hatched and reared in the dark. The responsiveness to red func- tionally fits the red comb of the hen. Therefore, according to our hypothesis green-receptive cones would in ducks activate, but in gulls and domestic chicks inhibit the motor control for feeding. Just as for gulls also for domestic chicks a bimodal as well as a unimodal distribution has been reported for the spectral sensitivity of pecking behaviour. A unimodal preference for long wavelength was found by GUNTHER &amp;JONES (1962) and by OPPENHEIM, JONES &amp; GOTTLIEB (1970), a bimodal preference for orange and blue was evident from ex- periments by CURTIUS (1954) and by FISCHER, MORRIS &amp; RUHSAM (1975). Possible causes for these differences are discussed by the latter authors and by HAILMAN (1968). As candidates for an explanation have been con- sidered the band width of the coloured light presented, its relative and its absolute intensity, the brightness of the background and the degree of il- lumination; but a definite conclusion has not been reached. Whatever the proper explanation may be, it does not effect our hypothesis. DUCKER (1963) studied in 8 passerine species, in a woodpecker, a par- rot and a quail, and WINKEL (1969) in 3 species of honeycreepers the preference for colours in a feeding situation. Differences in preference for spectral colours (both authors) as well as for non-spectral ones (DOCKER) were found; the authors are inclined to see these preference in relation to the plumage colour of the species. DOCKER tends to the opinion that these preferences are innate, but unfortunately none of her birds were reared or kept in isolation. With the honeycreepers WINKEL successfully carried out different kinds of conditioning experiments with colours as cues and food as reward. The birds were able to distinguish between adjacent col- ours of a 12-stage colour-series, covering the entire visible range of the spectrum. Differences in quality and in degree of saturation between col- ours were more quickly learned than differences in brightness. With</page><page sequence="335">322 G. P. BAERENDS respect to red and green, honeycreepers showed a preference for higher over lower saturation in spontaneous visits to colour-marked feeders. In the preceding chapter we have met with a number of responses for which a primary S-R linkage with a particular brightness distribution has been demonstrated. I suggest that in such cases a luminosity opponent mechanism is involved which is connected with all types of colour- sensitive photoreceptor cells and displays a pattern of hyperpolarization over the whole spectrum. b. Pattern. The data on larid birds have demonstrated susceptibility for two types of patterns: 1) the roughly even distribution of several speckles over a sur- face, 2) the presence of a single patch. The speckling pattern of eggs is generally recognized as subserving a camouflage function. TINBERGEN (1974) mentions that in an unpublished experiment by H. KRUUK in which unchanged black-headed gull eggs and evenly painted khaki ones were laid out in the field, the loss of the lat- ter exceeded that of the former. Such experiments are difficult to carry through because often specialized egg hunters appear, which have learn- ed to recognize and spot the eggs as food and are no longer fooled by the camouflage pattern (TINBERGEN, IMPEKOVEN &amp; FRANCK, 1967; CROZE, 1970; see also III.2.1.). If the sensitivity of the gull for a speckling pattern would primarily have evolved as a result of the survival value of this pattern, one would expect the gulls to have preferences for those characteristics which enhance its cryptic effect. However, this does not appear to be the case. The gulls were found to prefer darkness of the speckles, small size, large numbers and high contrast against a bright groundcolour. The combina- tion of these preferences makes the object conspicuous rather than cryp- tic. At least to our eyes the cryptic effect of small speckles is less than that of larger ones. Sensitivity of the gulls for difference in shade between primary and secondary spots (see I.3.d.), which so importantly con- tributes to the disruptive effect of the natural egg pattern, could not be demonstrated. A bright groundcolour tends to make the eggs con- spicuous against the background of the nest. Therefore, it is difficult to conceive of these preferences as having primarily evolved in adaptation to the existing camouflage pattern. One should therefore consider the alternative possibility that the visual system of larid birds primarily possesses - because of its organization - properties which account for it being sensitive to a number of features present in the camouflage pattern.</page><page sequence="336">GENERAL DISCUSSION 323 A spontaneous preference for directing responses to disrupted patterns when these are presented in competition with plain coloured surfaces, has been found in a wide range of animals (fish, birds, mammals: FANTZ, 1957, 1961; RENSCH, 1957, 1958, 1962, 1965) as well as in man (FANTZ, 1958, 1961). One explanation suggested for the stimulating effect of a chequered pattern assumes that the eye is susceptible for the temporal contrast, or flicker, arising in each locus of its projection on the retina when pattern and eye move with respect to one another. Initially this idea was postulated by WOLF (1933) and WOLF &amp; ZERRAHN-WOLF (1937) with respect to the responsiveness of the insect eye to the composite structure of flowers. Later, JAMES (1959) showed in experiments concerning filial imprinting that domestic chicks approach a flashing light in preference to a steady one. This fact was confirmed and further investigated by SMITH and his co-workers (see SMITH, 1961). HAILMAN (1967) discussed the hypothesis in relation with the movement of the bill patch in the food presenting herring gull. He tested laughing gull chicks in a kind of 'Skinner-box' in which the key was intermittedly illuminated with red light; the flicker frequency could be increased from 0 to 70 cycles/sec. The results suggested an increase of the effect of flicker up to a rate of 25 cycles/sec, followed by a decrease beyond 40 cycles/sec. HAILMAN himself expected flicker fusion to occur at about 50 cycles/sec. However, too much must not be made of this since the trend of the curve is not statistically reliable. It is conceivable that sensitivity for flicker might underlie the effec- tiveness of the speckling pattern of the egg. When before making a deci- sion the eyes of the gull move over the egg the amounts of energy reaching a retinal element will change more often over time with small than with large speckles and will increase with the number of speckles. The amplitude of the changes will increase with the contrast between speckles and background. Furthermore a negative speckling pattern dif- fers from a positive one in that the intervals between light hitting a retinal element when the eye moves at a constant speed, will be shorter in the former than in the latter. This might be the cause of the somewhat greater effect of a positive speckling pattern over a negative one made of the same grey shades. However, when entertaining this possible explana- tion one should realize that the local changes in the retina resulting from the shifting projection of the dummies, are caused due to movements of the bird vis a vis stationary dummies. A reafference mechanism (VON HOLST &amp; MITTELSTAEDT, 1950) must therefore be expected to neutralize</page><page sequence="337">324 G. P. BAERENDS the flashing effect on the retina at some level of the information process- ing procedure underlying final perception. This, however, does not seem to exlude the possibility that the flashing is effective, for instance in draw- ing attention, at a more peripheral level (recall GREGORY'S image-retina system as compared with this eye-head system; GREGORY, 1966). In one pilot experiment we have tried the effect of intermittant light on egg-retrieval. Two evenly khaki painted plastic egg dummies with a 6 V light bulb built inside, were presented on the nest-rim. The light was switched on as soon as the assistant had left the area; in one dummy the light was steady, in the other intermittent (4 cycles/sec). The tests were carried out after sunset, as soon as the relatively dim lights in the dum- mies became sufficiently conspicuous. Eight gulls were tried; the steady lighted dummy was chosen 27 times against the flickering one 11 times (for one bird the score was 17:2). The birds showed overt signs of being frightened of the lights; they often placed nest-material over the flickering dummy left on the nest-rim. Clearly this result does not support the hypothesis that the speckling pattern might owe its effectiveness to a flicker effect. However, the pilot experiment had so many theoretical and technical shortcomings that it cannot be considered sufficient to reject the hypothesis. We have not followed this up. Sensitivity to flicker is not the only possibility for explaining the effec- tiveness of spots. Already the fact that on eggs small sized speckles lead to higher scores, but in contrast, that on the bill large ones have this effect, compels us to look for alternative or additional explanations. The results of electrophysiological studies by, for instance, HARTLINE, WAGNER &amp; MACNICHOL (1952), KUFFLER (1953), HUBEL &amp; WIESEL (1959, 1960), HUBEL (1964) and MATURANA, LETTVIN, MCCULLOCH &amp; PITTS (1960) make it obvious to consider the possibility that particular detector mechanisms in the visual system could account for the sensitivity to spots. To my knowledge no relevant data on birds are available, but the 'net-convexity' or 'bug' detectors found in frogs (MATURANA et al., 1960) would come close to the type of detectors that might be involved here, if movement of the object would not be essential for activating them. Considering the fact that for the speckling pattern on eggs the effec- tiveness decreases with the size of the spots, whereas for the bill patch it increases, we would have to assume different types of detectors to play a role. Also, the egg-spots are more effective in large numbers and high density, whereas there is no indication that this would also hold for bill patches. However, these latter patches can be made more effective by</page><page sequence="338">GENERAL DISCUSSION 325 giving them a complex appearance through subdividing them, for in- stance by building them up of concentric rings. High sensitivity for a pat- tern of such structures has been found in fish, birds and mammals. Detectors with a geometry of the receptive-field of the bulls-eye type, such as have been found in a variety of animals, are likely to be involved here. The principal of lateral inhibition, underlying the function of such detectors, might also be responsible for the effectivenes of contrast in speckling patterns. This seems to fit the occurrence of differently col- oured bill tips, patches and stripes found in different species of the larid family. c. Size. Preference for stimuli within a certain size range can be considered as a better adaptation for the recognition of the adequate object than selectivi- ty based on a direct or inversed proportionality of the effectiveness of a stimulus object with its size. Nevertheless the latter mechanism may be sufficiently adaptive in a number of cases. Moreover it is likely to be simpler and easier to achieve without the incorporation of experience with the adequate object. The increase of effectiveness of an egg in proportion with its size is a phenomenon with adaptive value. Undersized eggs have a low chance to hatch and produce viable chicks; the chance of the chick to survive in- creases with the yolk content of the egg and physical constraints in egg production in the female put an upper limit to the size of the eggs. An ob- vious causal explanation for the effectiveness of the larger sized object, such as found in egg-retrieval, is the relatively greater number of retinal elements stimulated with increase of the dummy. However, this cannot be achieved without solving some complications. In the retrieval ex- periments the differently sized dummies are at the same distance from the head of the bird, so that their projections on the retina both correspond to the real sizes. In nest-choice experiments, however, birds were seen to make the decision of advancing to larger more distant dummies when they were standing near the smaller ones, thus in a situation in which the size of the retinal images could not have been simply proportional to the size of the eggs. Mechanisms of size constancy (VON HOLST, 1955a, b, c; KAUFMAN, 1974), as well as comparison with other objects around, are likely to be involved here in correcting the primary image sizes. Since we found that not the actual sizes of the images of both dummies on the retina were compared, but rather abstractions well represented by the</page><page sequence="339">326 G. P. BAERENDS maximum projection size, we must assume several computations to take place before comparison of the images is concluded. In several experiments the gulls did not prefer the largest dummies presented; their preference showed an optimum, usually for a size larger than normal. We have shown that such optima are likely to be the result of the interference of a second motivation, a tendency to flee, which also increases with the size of the dummy. The positive relation between effec- tiveness and size of patches on bills (R. &amp; U. WEIDMANN, 1958) or on the head part of a fish dummy (QUINE &amp; CULLEN, 1964) can be explained with a similar reasoning. Inversed proportionality of effectiveness with size seems to hold for the speckles on the egg-shell and for the width of the bill dummy in evoking begging in herring gull chicks. A small diameter of a spot cannot in itself be considered as an adapta- tion to the camouflage function. On the contrary, a low number of large spots will have a better cryptic (disruptive) effect than an equal number of small ones. It is the large number of small speckles which provides good camouflage. Nevertheless normal sized dummies with low densities of 16 or 64 small spots were more often retrieved first than dummies with equal numbers of larger spots (see Table 44). Since, however, the number of spots on an egg tends to be inversely correlated with their average size (see Table 3) under natural conditions this preference for small size does not conflict with the conditions favouring camouflage. How the inverse proportionality between the diameter of the speckles and their effectiveness is physiologically brought about is a question which I find at this moment impossible to answer. Turning to the second case, since the herring gull possesses a rather stout bill, the preference for narrowness emerging from dummy ex- periments does not seem functional. However, TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) have argued that when the chick is fed for the first time, it is still covered by the parent so that, when the latter bends over it, the chick sees the bill from its most narrow ventral side. Later on it would learn to recognize the bill also from the broad side. The authors remark: "the thinness of the bill therefore is of any consequence only at the very first feeding, and it is interesting to notice that the high sensitivity to the thin- ness of the bill is such an important aspect of the IRM, and that it ap- parently stays until well after its function has been fulfilled, for even relatively old chicks show it" (p. 23). If the hypothesis holds true one would expect it to apply to related species. HAILMAN (1967), however, states that he found in the laughing</page><page sequence="340">GENERAL DISCUSSION gull, and WEIDMANN in the black-headed gull, an optimum bill diameter (8 mm). This optimum HAILMAN considers adapted because it matches the width of the bill of the parent when viewed from a position 45° to the side, as a chick often does. HAILMAN (1967) has postulated and tested the hypothesis that this op- timum width for pecking rate might be due to the flicker effect caused by the combination of speed of movement and width of the bill, the pecking rate increasing with the frequency of flicker and dropping when flicker fu- sion is attained. However, the author had finally to conclude that the chicks assess movement and width independently. Interference of a tendency to escape, or any other tendency, does not seem to be a likely hypothesis for cases of inverse proportionality between effectiveness and size of the object. Since in the experiments by HAILMAN and WEIDMANN the chicks had been kept isolated and raised in the dark, experience cannot have played a role in setting the limits. This is not like- ly to have been the case either in experiments in which FANTZ (1957, 1961) found an optimum diameter (1/8 inch) for objects releasing ex- ploratory pecking in inexperienced domestic chicks. This is about the size of seed taken for food. One wonders if detectors sensitive for a particular size range of projections on the retina might exist. d. Shape. In the preceding chapter experiments have been discussed in which gulls have been found to respond to characters of shape of an object, in spite of absence of previous experience with objects of that kind. In addition the gulls were found able to learn details about the shape of objects, but here we shall first deal with information available on shape which cannot have been derived from experience with the adequate situation. One such feature is the three-dimensionality of the egg. With his elegant 'displacement goggle' technique, HESS (1965) has shown that leghorn chicks possess the possibility for binocular depth perception without prior visual experience. DAWKINS (1968) demonstrated that naive chicks are also capable of monocular depth perception. He made it likely that the use of shading cues is one way in which this is achieved and that this capacity does not have to be learned. Thus being a solid is a feature of shape available for genetic coding in the bird. Roundness was the other important shape-feature effective for the egg- retrieval response. Sensitivity for roundness we found easier to demonstrate than preference for the real egg-shape. FANTZ (1957, 1961) found the rate of exploratory pecking in fowl chicks at each of eight dif- 327</page><page sequence="341">328 G. P. BAERENDS ferent objects to increase with its roundness. A sphere received ten times as many responses as a sharp edged pyramid. This preference was already clear in the first 10 minutes the freshly hatched chicks were ex- posed to light, but it had become more marked after 40 minutes. The same author demonstrated a relatively high effectiveness for curved con- tours of two dimensional figures in newborn infants (FANTZ &amp; DE MIRAN- DA, 1975). In their analysis of the situation evoking the begging response in her- ring gull chicks TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) found equal response rates toward a flat cardboard dummy and a stuffed herring gull's head. Thus, for this reaction three-dimensionality was of no importance. In how far stereopsis played a role in spatial orientation of the pecks towards the ob- jects presented was not investigated. The sensitivity of the begging response of larid chicks does not appear to be differentially adapted to the bills of different species. In all, maximum sensitivity was achieved by a combination of different char- acteristics of shape: being an extension, narrow, vertical and low. Although TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) tried to explain the sensitivity to narrowness as adapted to the specific situation in which a recently hatch- ed herring gull chick sees the bill of its parent, I am more inclined to see it as a phylogenetic heritage of the larid group, sufficient to guide the chick of each species, but not adapted to serve each species exclusively. In the black-headed gull (WEIDMANN, pers. comm.) and the laughing gull (HAILMAN, 1967) a horizontal movement of the bill with a speed of 80 strokes per min was most effective. HAILMAN proved that the preferences for speed and bill-width were independent and could therefore not be reduced to a preference for optimal flicker frequency. The effectiveness of protrusions or indentations of the contour of a dummy in directing begging responses was also found by TINBERGEN &amp; KUENEN (1939) in dummy experiments with young thrushes. In domestic chicks, reared in isolation CRONHELM (1970) found markedly indented edge contours to be one of the perceptual features important in evoking high pecking response frequencies towards various stimulus cards. The examples show that naive birds possess stimulus-response links relating elementary characteristics of shape with specific responses or response groups. As earlier pointed out by HAILMAN (1964, 1970, 1971) particularly with reference to the begging response in gull chicks, suggestions for a causal explanation of this sensitivity can be derived from the literature on detec- tors involved in pattern discrimination. With regard to birds MATURANA</page><page sequence="342">GENERAL DISCUSSION 329 and his co-workers found detectors for directional movement for horizon- tal edges, and for curvatures in pigeons (MATURANA &amp; FRENK, 1963; MATURANA, 1964). Various types of detectors for basic visual features, such as lines, bars, edges, orientations and movements as well as for more specialized features have been found in mammals (rabbits, cats, monkeys). Localization and anatomy is very different between major tax- onomical groups; one cannot simply homologize between the detectors found in amphibia and mammals and consequently one cannot ex- trapolate from findings in these groups to the birds in which this aspect so far has been little studied. For our purpose we must suffice with the speculation that also in birds a variety of these tools for the discrimination of elementary features of shape exist. e. Conclusion. The considerations of this chapter lead to the following conclusions: 1. The selective responsiveness of motor patterns to releasing or direc- ting stimuli, as appearing in dummy experiments on the effectiveness of characters of colour, pattern and size, and of elementary components of shape, are not more than roughly adapted to the actual features of the adequate stimulus situation. 2. The rudimentary nature of the adaptiveness is likely to be due to only a restricted amount of possibilities for adaptation being available. The primary S-R links found in a species often seem to have emerged from 'competition and compromises' between the interests of different motor patterns. 3. The restrictions are attributed to constraints resulting from the physiological mechanisms involved. Consequently, insight in these con- straints might lead to disclosure of the physiological mechanism underly- ing the primary S-R links. 4. Knowledge of the nature of the primary S-R links will lead to sug- gestions of how information about adequate stimulus situations might be encoded in inexperienced animals. 5. The nature of the stimulation evoking the various responses in naive birds suggests that the primary S-R links involved might consist of direct connections of motor control units with neurons with special detec- tor capacities for particular types of wavelength distributions, brightness, patterns, size ranges, or elements of shape. f. Hypothesis. As a consequence of these conclusions I arrive at postulating the hypothesis that the performance of adequate responses to the (external)</page><page sequence="343">330 G. P. BAERENDS stimulus situation by naive animals is made possible through a set of con- nections of the motor control unit of a response, or motivational system, with a limited number of different detectors. These connections are thought to develop independently of experience with the complete ade- quate situation, according to morphogenetical principles. The assort- ment of the detectors in each collection accounts for response- (or motivation-) as well as for species-specificity. It is the result of a process of selection involving the possibilities, constraints and compromises men- tioned above, encoded in the genes. With "development without experience with the adequate evoking situation" I do not mean to suggest that the expression of the genes car- rying the blueprint for the ontogeny of the detectors and their connec- tions with various motor control units would take place without any in- teraction with the environment, including the incorporation of ex- perience. For instance, BLAKEMORE (1973) has produced strong evidence that the development of detectors for the direction of lines in space in cats, is dependent on early experience with such lines. Thus, according to this conception the essence of the IRM of a response is in the connections of motor control units involved in the ex- ecution of that response with a particular set of detectors. With the sug- gested mechanism for the identification of a stimulus situation, the chance that the animal has indeed encountered a situation which is ade- quate increases with the number of different types of detectors firing into the control unit. Heterogeneous summation of the information received from these different types is a procedure actually measuring this likelihood. However, under our artificial experimental conditions we were able to make this mechanism respond to inadequate situations by exaggerating one or more stimulus modalities. Following our hypothesis this will have led to an increase of the rate of firing of the corresponding detectors into the motor control unit concerned and/or an increase of the number of these detectors activated. Detectors signalling that a particular stimulus quality is present, and possibly also in what quantity, but which continue firing if that quantity increases over the amount naturally received, would cause the phenomenon of supernormality. The connec- tion of a motor control unit with a detector makes that unit sensitive to any stimulus inducing that detector to fire. If the rate of firing or the number of units firing increases with the intensity of the stimulus, the motor mechanism will react correspondingly with a greater intensity of the response.</page><page sequence="344">GENERAL DISCUSSION 331 To check the supernormality effect a mechanism comparing the situa- tion presented with a standard natural situation would be necessary. Ob- viously the IRM does not have such a provision. However, there is a more general provision in case of strong external stimulation, viz. the ac- tivation of the tendency to avoid or to escape. One of the results of this is a conflict between this tendency and the tendency which was primarily activated, leading to an optimum value for the effectiveness of a stimulus on the response. We already met this phenomenon above most extensive- ly in the experiments on size. Our analysis of the motivational conditions favouring decisions based on supernormality and on resemblance to the natural object in egg-retrieval choices have revealed a second provision against dangers of the supernormality effect: when the escape tendency is activated the influence of the IRM is throttled or even excluded. In that case comparison of the stimuli received, with a situation expected on basis of experience with the natural object, and thus on memory, prevails. In short-lived invertebrates the links between detectors and motor con- trol units must form the most important mechanism through which their behaviour is adaptively controlled. Animals with a longer lifespan are much more often found to respond to a complex of details in the external situation, most likely through use of their memory. The next chapter discusses the possibility that the primary, S-R links play a role in guiding the encoding of items in the memory.</page><page sequence="345">CHAPTER 3 THE INFLUENCE OF PRIMARY S-R LINKAGES IN NAIVE ANIMALS ON LEARNING In a paper on the historical development of the IRM concept SCHLEIDT (1962) has made the statement that in adult vertebrates as a rule releasing mechanisms modified by experience (IRME) would be more common than simple IRMs. With respect to gulls this statement is confirmed in, for instance, HAILMAN'S experiments on the development of the respon- siveness of chicks to various parts of the parent's head (p. 310). It is an interesting question whether the part of the information processing chain meant with the term IRM possesses possibilities for stimulating and guiding the learning processes by which it is extended. For attempts to answer this question I find a path analytical model, developed by SUTHERLAND (1959, 1964) to infer the logic of the system mediating learning illuminating because it contains elements strongly resembling parts of the hypothesis developed in the preceding chapter (see also BAERENDS &amp; KRUIJT, 1973). In SUTHERLAND'S model (Fig. 67) various 'analysers', which are virtually identical with what I have called 'detectors' receive input from the receptors. Attachments between these receptors and units for motor responses are made when the performance of that response is reinforced while the analyser is switched on. Then it can be tuned in at different strength; the more strongly it has become ac- tivated the faster the response attachment with that analyser is made and the less strongly other analysers are switched on. Following this line of thought it is obvious to ask whether the set of detectors which as the result of a genetically programmed developmental process have become attached to the motor unit of a particular response, and which are therefore switched in when this response is being perform- ed, in addition activate learning processes attaching other responses to the same detectors. Our data and some data in the literature contain indications that this might hold true. In the following they shall be briefly discussed. In IV.2. we have reported on our attempts to teach gulls in a retrieval experiment to avoid dummies of a particular colour, by pegging such dummies in the nest-rim. We found that the inhibition to retrieve was more readily built up for green and yellow than for red and blue. Thus it appears that the colours inducing the strongest incubation responses</page><page sequence="346">GENERAL DISCUSSION 333 .R, , ...Js2 j responses // /1/ ^ ' &gt;&amp;lt; ""a\ response attachments IB i GL ] _"V output analyst es i , STIMULUS INPUT Fig. 67. SUTHERLAND'S theoretical model for a system mediating discrimination learning. The elements A are analysers evaluating the variation of a particular stimulus on one dimension, e.g. Al detects brightness differences (B = black, W= white) and A2 the amount of horizontal (H) and vertical (V) contour. Outputs of different analysers can become combined in one response mechanism, e.g. B and H in RI and W and V in R2; the dot/dash lines indicate strongly established response attachments, the dashed lines possible further attachments. Analysers can be switched on or off; switching on is possible to different extents. Discrimination learning is thought to involve two processes: 1) learn- ing to switch in the analyser suitable for the discrimination required, 2) learning to make the appropriate attachments between the outputs of the analysers and the responses (After SUTHERLAND, 1964). towards eggs are also most effective in the establishment of new associa- tions in the context of incubation behaviour. Further gulls could be conditioned to change temporarily their usual preference for speckled over plain eggs to the reverse, but we did not suc- ceed (within a similar time period) to teach the birds to differentiate con- sistently between normally and abnormally shaped dummies by pegging either one of these. Consequently, the relative strength of different kinds of stimuli for inducing egg-retrieval and settling, thus the extent to which a particular analyser is tuned in, also seems to be important for establishing new associations with respect to eggs. Data in support of this inference can be found in the literature. In guillemots (Uria aalge), in which each pair has an incubation site without a nest structure and only one egg, TSCHANZ (1959) found that individuals learn how their egg is coloured and patterned. When the appearance of the egg changes, usually because of faeces adhering, the birds are able to incorporate such changes in their preference, provided they take place gradually. When changing the colour and pattern of the egg with paint,</page><page sequence="347">334 G. P. BAERENDS TSCHANZ found that changes in both types of stimuli could be learned. However, when in competition, colour changes dominated over pattern changes, and for learning a colour change, green proved to be a more powerful colour than blue. Shape was found of little importance. A guillemot which had become accustomed to a yellow painted egg went through considerable trouble to roll a yellow cube-shaped block to the nest, even when this was placed far beyond the (empty) incubation site. The order of effectiveness found here for the different stimulus categories in this learning process is the same as the one we found for egg retrieval in the herring gull (11.7.). Dr P. INGOLD kindly informed me that auks (Alca torda) also manage to learn their individual egg, using colour as well as speckling pattern as cues. His experiments indicate that the pattern of distribution of the speckles over the eggs is more important for recogniz- ing it than the average speckle size and the density of the pattern. The auks also learn the changes in appearance of their eggs when these become covered with dirt, provided this happens gradually (pers. comm.). Another indication for a positive influence of a primary S-R link on learning can be found in the work by TINBERGEN, KRUUK &amp; PAILLETTE (1962c) on the effects on egg-shell removal of experience with different colours, during incubation responses. Birds which had been sitting on green painted eggs had a relatively higher score for retrieving green eggs and removing green shells than birds sitting on black clutches had for retrieving black egg dummies and carrying black shells. These results raise the question whether larid birds would relatively more easily make associations with red (and blue) than with green objects in contexts of feeding and social contacts, and thus corresponding to the preferences for colour found in naive birds when begging and ap- proaching their parents. Unfortunately, as far as my knowledge goes no experiments suitable for answering this question have been made with such birds. However, in other taxonomic groups of birds experiments have been made which bear relevance to this problem. In naive domestic chicks SCHAEFER &amp; HESS (1959) found in pecking for food objects an unconditioned preference for yellow over shorter and longer wavelengths. In contrast, such chicks when presented with 5 dif- ferently coloured moving spheres (diam. 17.5 cm), preferred to approach and follow the long and short wavelength colours and responded least to yellow. Correspondingly, when tested for imprinting results the scores were also lowest for yellow; the authors attribute this to the lower effort expended by the chick when following objects of intermediate wavelength. It should be mentioned, however, that other authors testing</page><page sequence="348">GENERAL DISCUSSION 335 (but less extensively) colour preferences for following in domestic chicks with other techniques, failed to confirm these results (see BATESON, 1966, p. 185). In agreement with the results of SCHAEFER and HESS is a finding by BATESON &amp; REESE (1969) that domestic chicks could be conditioned more easily to press a pedal when rewarded by an orange than by a green flashing light as 'social companion'. The chicks also more readily ap- proached the orange light when given a free choice between both. Inspired by these results, GOODWIN &amp; HESS (1969a, b) determined the order of preference for food pecking and for aspects of the filial following response with respect to ten two dimensional objects, equal in size but differing in shape. The order in which the different shapes evoked or directed reactions was different for the two response categories; feeding pecks were negatively correlated with attention and incipent approach, the two measures were used as indicators of filial response.*) These data - though still scanty - seem to indicate that when the ef- fectiveness for eliciting responses belonging to a particular functional system in naive birds is unequal for different colours, a corresponding in- equality holds for their effectiveness in the formation of new associa- tions through learning in the same functional context. On the basis of these system-specific preferences the intensity of the unconditioned response, the learning process and the conditioned response seem to be positively related to the physical strength of the stimulus. In the case mentioned here the unconditioned S-R link sometimes facilitated an im- printing process (learning species-specific features by the chick) and sometimes a potentially reversable learning process, such as in the adap- tation of guillemots to changes in the appearance of their eggs. In research on imprinting the question whether the speed or strength of the learning process is dependent on the kind of stimulation has often been entertained. The possibility that in this respect physical stimuli might differ in effectiveness, depending on the kind of response or behavioural system concerned, has - to my knowledge - not been con- *) Different authors (ENGELMANN, 1943; CURTILUS, 1954 and GOODWIN &amp; HESS, 1969a) have looked for preference for certain forms over others in food pecking of naive chicks. Their conclusions do not agree: ENGELMANN as well as GOODMAN &amp; HESS believe to have found such preferences but CURTIUS denied them. However, the techniques used were dif- ferent and so was the control of an interfering influence of size. To me the results suggest that the consistent elements (e.g. curves, angles, edges) determined the frequency of peck- ing and not the geometrical forms (circles, squares, triangles, stars, etc.) as the in- vestigators conclude.</page><page sequence="349">336 G. P. BAERENDS sidered; probably since most imprinting research was done on one kind of response only: the following of a parent by young of nidifuguous birds. When discussing the question of what might be the physiological basis underlying the high effectiveness of speckling in responses towards eggs, sensitivity for flicker was mentioned as a possibility. Intermittant stimulation has actually been demonstrated to facilitate imprinting in af- filiative behaviour. Approach and following of an object could be increas- ed by providing a source of flicker or placing the object near a flickering light. JAMES (1959, 1960) found not only a flickering light more powerful in inducing the approach response than a stationary one, but also that a high rate of flicker was more effective in releasing and maintaining this response than a low rate. SMITH (1960, 1962) and SMITH &amp; HOYES (1961) have compared the effect on imprinting of a flickering light and of a mov- ing pattern (rotating black and white patterned disc). Their results sug- gest that the effect of movement is not equal to that of flickering. Under the experimental conditions used the attachment to the rotating disc was stronger than to the flickering light, particularly in chicks of at least four days old. These data seem to allow the tentative conclusion that not so much particular kinds of stimulation facilitate and guide these learning pro- cesses, but rather the degree to which they are perceived by the animal as conspicuous. BATESON (1964) has demonstrated that birds can also imprint on static objects. The effectiveness of such objects he found to increase with their conspicuousness to the human eye. Conspicuousness implies contrast with the surroundings and this is often due to differences in relatively simple physical properties, for which detectors are present in the recep- tive mechanism. Consequently it is well conceivable that a primary S-R link attaching such a detector to a particular response in a naive animal also facilitates imprinting (and other learning processes) with respect to the situation concerned. Egg-retrieval as well as pecking at the bill of the parent is positively affected by contrast between patches and background: the guillemots learn to recogize their egg individually on basis of the pattern of these patches. The question should be raised here in how far oddity and novelty, since they imply a form of contrast and thus conspicuousness, must be considered in the context of the possibility that S-R linkages primarily present in naive animals facilitate learning processes. MUELLER (1968, 1971, 1974, 1975) maintains that hawks may select their prey on the basis of oddity. He either presented an odd coloured</page><page sequence="350">GENERAL DISCUSSION 337 prey simultaneously with several equally coloured ones, or together with a prey of the other colour after several prey of that colour had been suc- cessively offered. In both types of presentation the odd prey was more often preferred. To appreciate oddity in these experiments a comparison of simultaneously present objects and/or a matching of objects present with memorized images is required; it cannot be the result of relatively simple S-R links. MUELLER'S use of the term oddity does not fully comply with the use of the term in learning psychology when animals are tested on their capacity of learning to recognize the reward value of oddity (= deviation from the majority) as an abstraction (MOON &amp; HARLOW, 1955). MUELLER rather uses the term for the appearance of a prey to which the predator is not accustomed; the primary aim of his study was to test the searching image hypothesis and the odd colour of prey was the one for which the bird could not have developed such a short-term specific template. This means that there is not much difference between oddity in MUELLER'S sense and (relative) novelty. Novelty too implies comparison with memorized experience. Consequently it cannot operate before at least some learning about the situation considered has taken place. Novelty is known to stimulate exploratory behaviour (BERLYNE, 1960) as well as a tendency to escape (BARNETT, 1958). Which behaviour ensues is likely to depend on the strength of the contrast, in accordance with SCHNEIRLA'S (1956) theory that strong stimuli tend to repel, whereas weak stimuli tend to attract the subject. But as SCHNEIRLA has pointed out this interaction creates a possibility for learning. KAGAN (1970) has postulated that in gradually building up the picture of a face, a young child would in particular use relatively small deviations from the familiar image, thus weak novelty stimuli. The data given in this chapter provide some basis - though admitted- ly still a weak one - for ascribing to the detectors postulated in the preceding chapter for the identification of the adequate situation evoking a response, in addition an analyser's function in SUTHERLAND'S sense. When switched in as a result of the internal activation of a behavioural system, the analyser (detector) will - according to SUTHERLAND - make new attachments with the motor units of other responses, provided the latter are positively reinforced, or it will dislodge attachments when the reinforcement is negative. It is likely that once a set of detectors have elicited the corresponding response, information about other features of the object and the situation concerned is obtained and associated with the response. Classical condi-</page><page sequence="351">338 G. P. BAERENDS tioning could account for this extension of the knowledge about a stimulus situation. It seems plausible that in this way the bird learns rela- tions between different stimuli. Examples of such learned relationships have been mentioned. Recall the guillemots and auks learning the chang- ing appearance of their eggs when these become covered with faeces (TSCHANZ, 1959; INGOLD, pers. comm.), and of the herring gull chick learning that normally the red patch is situated on the tip of the parent's bill. The idea that for a stimulus response attachment to result from learn- ing, the analyser sensitive for this stimulus has first to be switched in, seems in contradiction with those cases mentioned above in which highly contrasting, conspicuous or odd stimuli were found to be relatively easily associated with a response. However, in SUTHERLAND'S hypothesis two separate processes are involved in discrimination learning: 1) learning to switch in an analyser appropriate for making a discrimination, and 2) learning which response to attach to that analyser. Perhaps the strength of a stimulus is a determinant in the decision which analyser should be switched in, just as the strength with which an analyser is switched in is a determinant for the speed with which the response attachment is made. On the other hand there is KAGAN'S (1970) hypothesis, mentioned above that learning (of features of the mother by a human baby) would be facilitated by slight instead of large discrepancies between the familiar and novel stimulus situation. The reported positive relationship between the strength of a stimulus and the chance that it becomes associated with a response, makes one consider the possibility that during learning to avoid retrieving the green, yellow or speckled dummy, the relevant detectors were only active because this stimulation was relatively strong, and not because these detectors were previously activated by an internal mechanism. Green, for instance, is the brightest colour to the herring gull's eye, it is at the peak of the luminosity curve; speckling may be highly stimulating because of its flicker effect. However, in particular the results obtained by SCHAEFFER &amp; HESS (1959) could not be explained this way since, although it is true that green was the most effective colour for filial imprinting, it did not score highest for food-pecking.</page><page sequence="352">CHAPTER 4 A MODEL OF THE INFORMATION PROCESSING MECHANISM In the preceding chapters a number of tasks have been identified which are carried out by the information processing mechanism of a gull to make it respond to particular stimuli in its environment. In the present chapter I shall try to arrange these tasks in a flow diagram type model. This model should account for the general phenomena appearing from our study as well as for single observations made. In particular it should be possible with this model to provide a causal explanation for the phenomenon that responsiveness to supernormal stimuli and to com- plicated configurations of details can proceed in the same animal and even with respect to the same situation and the same motor pattern. Although the model will be developed on the basis of data obtained with gulls it is hoped that it will hold for animals in general - including our own species, for which the susceptibility to supernormal stimulus situa- tions has been well established. The advantage of constructing diagrams of this type is that one is forc- ed to systematically ask various questions about all possible relationships. Choices have to be made between alternatives and for every unit, every connection and every sign - inserted as well as omitted - a justification has to be given. The model should cover the data available at the moment it is made. When more knowledge is obtained the model should be im- proved by extending and changing it. The model should serve the clear formulation of hypotheses and stimulate an efficient collection of more data in order to penetrate deeper into the problems studied. The model concerns processes mediating between the receptors and ef- fectors. It should represent partial functions or tasks and it should as much as possible leave open for further phases of causal research the question which anatomical structures and physiological mechanisms take part ii fulfilling these tasks. In accordance with our data and the conclusions drawn from them, our model has to correspond with and to provide for the following conditions and characteristics, based on the conclusions and hypotheses developed in the earlier chapters, as indicated. 1. Detectors for different properties of environmental stimulation are connected groupwise with units selecting the information for eliciting a particular motor pattern or group of such patterns. Each group of links</page><page sequence="353">340 G. P. BAERENDS represents the object or situation functionally adequate for evoking that response (V.I., concl. 1, V.2., concl. 5 and hypothesis). 2. These selector units are internally activated by the motivational system superimposed on the response concerned. This system or sub- system itself may be activated by an appropriate external stimulus situa- tion (in case of egg-retrieval: an egg on the nest-rim) (V.1., concl. 2, 3, 4). 3. Activation of a system facilitates retrieval of relevant items from memory and leads to comparison of these with the actual situation (IV.3.a.).

Explanation in text.</page><page sequence="354">GENERAL DISCUSSION 341 4. Correspondence between the actual and the memorized situation contributes positively to the occurrence of the response, deviation stimulates a mechanism for escape or avoidance (11.6.8.). 5. The information selected from the detectors, the motivational system and the comparison with memory is combined in accordance with the rule of heterogeneous summation. The final output stimulates the motor mechanism of the response (e.g. egg-retrieval) by which the situa- tion is handled, the behavioural final common path (MCFARLAND, 1974) (11.7.6.). 6. The memorized picture of the situation is supposed to be extended continuously as a result of perception of the environment and experience with it. However, the stimulation received by the selector unit through its linkage with special detectors is considered to give guidance to the forma- tion of a memory template, relevant for evoking the response served by that unit (IV.2.). 7. Memorized characteristics of a situation can act independently of one another in the integration of stimulation evoking the response (11.7.6.). 8. Learnt characteristics are rated lower than characteristics determin- ed by the primary S-R links (11.7.6.). 9. Activation of a tendency to flee or to avoid reduces the effectiveness of primary S-R links (11.6.8.). A flow diagram visualizing these characteristics in the simplest way I can presently conceive of, is given in Fig. 68. In the top-centre of the model a selector unit for assembling and co-ordinating the incoming in- formation from the detectors has been placed. It is the core of the mechanism for the identification of the stimulus object adequate for evok- ing a particular response or group of responses. This is due to an ex- clusive sensitivity for input from a set of different detectors (D3, D6, D9), typifying the object in this combination (the egg in case of egg-retrieval). Through heterogeneous summation of these inputs the output of the selector is determined. It seems parsimonious to assume that the inputs from the detectors always reach the selector - for this is basic for the situation-specific- sensitivity - but that its output can only lead to a response when the state of the corresponding behaviour system (i.e. the incubation system N) is sufficiently activated. This internal stimulation is thought to ac- tivate the selector and to be combined with the input from the selector in a unit called the 'integrator'.</page><page sequence="355">342 G. P. BAERENDS Beside input from the selector and the motivational system the in- tegrator also receives input from memory. It is assumed in the model that, when the incubation system is activated, memorized knowledge about the nest situation is retrieved. This knowledge will have been ac- cumulated during all activities and experiences of the bird in the nest area. It is thought to have developed with guidance of the primary links between the selector and the detectors and when the incubation system is activated, to be facilitated through a corollary of the output of the in- tegrator to the mechanism by which the performance of the motor pattern concerned is executed (behavioural common path). This corollary is thought to facilitate the formation of associations with various stimuli from the eggs and the nest situation whenever the behaviour executed is rewarded, i.e. the optimal situation for incubation is restored. Correspondence of the stimulus situation observed with the situation expected in accordance with the memory content relevant for retrieval (e.g. the appearance of the egg) leads to a positive output from 'memory control' into the integrator; deviation to a negative one. The integrator unit combines the three types of inputs it receives through heterogeneous summation. Deviations, in addition, lead to stimulation of the motiva- tional system for escape and can contribute in this way to an inhibition of the input from the selector. Activation of E can, of course, also take place directly through external stimulation without the intermediary of memory. In this model I have assumed a direct effect of E on the output of the selector instead of another alternative which occurred to me, namely to attribute the increased influence of memorized knowledge exclusively to the postponement of the reaction, which also results from activation of E. One could reason that the increased latency creates more time for memory retrieval, so that memorized knowledge would gain in impor- tance. Although this may in fact be true the results of our experiments (in particular those on shape) indicate that the effect of learnt features by itself does never become strong enough to overrule that of the input from the primary S-R links in the absence of inhibition. In case of egg-retrieval in the herring gull nothing seems to argue against the hypothesis that in- terference with the effect of the primary S-R links is always caused by an escape tendency. However, when this model is generalized to other cases in which the reaction to the primary S-R links is suppressed in favour of response to learnt knowledge, the possibility of an interference by other systems or mechanisms than such for escape should be envisaged.</page><page sequence="356">GENERAL DISCUSSION 343 In earlier models for the releasing mechanism concept (BAERENDS, 1971; BAERENDS &amp; KRUIJT, 1973) I postulated, between the receptor elements and the unit for heterogeneous summation, a separate unit for the evaluation of the quality and quantity of the input from that element (Fig. 69). One reason for this was that some features apparently had a greater impact than others on the release of a response; another reason was the notion that the same kind of stimulation could vary quantitative- ly. At present I do not think that the evidence justifies the insertion of such units. Qualitative differences in the relative effectiveness of stimuli are only evident between learnt and non-learnt features (e.g. with respect to eggs, between egg-shape and green groundcolour); the new model can account for this difference through the differentiation between selector and integrator. Further, measuring the quantity of information transmit- ted by the detector is in this model thought to be included in the task of the selector. -.3 R IN S rOUT Fig. 69. Diagram of the releasing mechanism as earlier postulated by BAERENDS (1971). R = unit in the receptive field, E = unit for evaluation of the stimulus received, S = sum- mation unit. In the model the inhibiting effect of the activated escape system is con- ceived to act on the entire output of the selector. However, we should not overlook the possibility that, if the deviation from expectancy activating escape concerns one type of feature only (for instance size or ground- colour of a dummy presented on the nest-rim) the escape system might selectively act only on that S-R link. We have one argument which might</page><page sequence="357">344 G. P. BAERENDS support that idea: the drop of the value of green measured in gull cy4908 on 13-6-1960 after it had been scared by a diving jet fighter-plane just at the moment it was to retrieve a green dummy (11.7., Fig. 55). One solu- tion to account for it in the model would be to return to inserting an evaluation unit in all connections between the detectors and the collector unit and to connect each of these evaluation units separately with the system for escape. Another possibility is to postulate that as a result of this experience a strong negative value of green became temporarily associated to the memory template for egg-features. This latter alter- native is covered by the present model. The results of the experiments indicate that information retrieved from memory does not necessarily act as an indivisible whole. A learnt feature such as egg-shape, can be effective in determining the value of a dummy in the absence of other learnt characteristics of the real egg (e.g. texture, gloss, details of the speckling pattern). Thus the values of separate elements from the entire engram concerning a particular situation can be combined with those of unlearnt elements in the process of heterogeneous summation. Some information retrieved from memory concerns knowledge, learnt from experience with the adequate object, about configurational relation- ships between features, each of which were already effective separately before such knowledge was gained. HAILMAN'S (1967) finding that the correct place of the red patch on the herring gulls bill is learned comes in- to this class. Another example, from a different group of animals, was reported by BAERENDS &amp; BAERENDS-VAN ROON (1950). They found that fry of Cichlasoma meeki, a fish with care for its offspring, when reared in isolation of the parents are strongly attracted by red and by silver dum- mies. Only fry raised with the parents began to prefer from 2 weeks on a patterning in which both colours were combined over plain red or plain silver dummies. The adults are silver with red underneath; obviously the fry had learned that in the parents both colours are present in combina- tion. No evidence was obtained of the form of the pattern being used as a cue. In chapter V.7. dealing further with the nature of the information pro- cessing procedure, we shall suggest that the bird makes its decision be- tween the dummies presented by adding, for each of the two alternatives, the values of the position and the 'retrieval-value' of the dummy, while subtracting the 'fear-inducing-value' (using 'addition' and 'subtraction' only as a preliminary indication, as long as no sophisticated data allowing conclusions on the mathematics underlying the process of heterogeneous</page><page sequence="358">GENERAL DISCUSSION 345 summation are available). Our model has two modes in which subtrac- tion can take place. First, if a dummy exerts a frightening effect the in- hibitive influence of E 'throttles' the output of the selector. Second, the deviation from the expected real egg is fed with a negative sign into the integrator. Information on the value of the nest-rim position is also retrieved from memory and by the integrator added to the reduced input from the selector. The fact mentioned in the end of II.5.4. that by increasing the size of a dummy beyond that of the normal egg, painting it green (or light grey) and providing it with a relatively high density of small dark spots, an ef- fectiveness was reached surpassing that of the normal egg, can be understood as a consequence of the information flow of the model. It was achieved by increasing parameters of the information passing through the primary S-R linkages involved in egg-retrieval. The combined value of the stimulation received this way from the dummy outweighed that resulting from the larger number of features of the real egg and fed into the integrator after comparison with memory. The model was primarily constructed for explaining the phenomenon that the same animal at one moment may only respond to a particular situation on the basis of a relatively large number of features, at other times on the basis of a few supernormal stimuli and often also to a com- bination of both. In addition, the model suggests a way in which, in the course of the individual's ontogeny, information about that situation is, in a particular preprogrammed way fed into memory, facilitated by infor- mation from a specific set of detectors converging on one selector. The sets of detectors for different response groups must have developed in the course of phylogeny as the result of a selection process with the adequate object as an ultimate factor. Particularly in short living animals such sets are commonly the only way for being able to respond adequately to exter- nal situations. In addition, in longer living animals these sets guide the storage of more and detailed information the animal is confronted with. One could also conceive that a template, with which a particular feed- back has to be compared, develops in this way; first guided by preformed links with detectors, which however, after completion of the template, should be blocked to exclude reactions to supernormality. The reader should realize that, since the model is meant to stand for the RM-concept, the part relevant to that hypothetical mechanism has been further worked out than those concerning the motivational systems or the memory. For the former a model has been given in Part I, C.2 to which I shall come back in the last chapter of this discussion. With</page><page sequence="359">346 G. P. BAERENDS respect to memory I have restricted myself to indicating the storage of in- formation obtained while dealing with its own clutch ('ns-general') and the possibility of checking the template resulting from this process with the nest-situation perceived during a test ('ns-test'). No attempt has been made to include any representation of the other activities, primary S-R links and detectors that might be involved in the formation of that template. The idea implicit in this model, that animals might be more responsive to strong stimuli, with respect to activities performed immediately as well as to the formation of learning processes, could be taken as contradictory to the basic principle of SCHNEIRLA'S theory on the biphasic processes of approach and withdrawal underlying learning in ontogeny. According to SCHNEIRLA (1959) low stimulus intensities would evoke approach of the source of stimulation and high intensities withdrawal. In our explanation of the responsiveness to supernormal stimulation rather the reverse ap- parently holds true. It seems to me, however, that the two principles need not necessarily be in conflict, provided they affect the animal at different times. The principle SCHNEIRLA emphasized is especially important when an animal meets a stimulus situation it is not yet acquainted with. In that case a tendency to escape will be activated and thus, in accordance with our model, a positive reaction to strong stimuli will be inhibited. If the animal is at ease, however, there is no reason why strong stimuli - pro- vided they do not strongly activate escape - would not exert a larger positive effect than weak ones. The importance of SCHNEIRLA'S idea is not so much how interaction between approach and withdrawal occurs, but that it takes place and thus furnishes time and opportunity for learning.</page><page sequence="360">CHAPTER 5 A COMPARISON OF OUR MODEL WITH THE CLASSICAL IRM-CONCEPT The model given in the preceding chapter has been primarily developed for explaining the experimental results obtained in larid birds with respect to their responsiveness to external stimulus situations. In this chapter we shall compare essentials of this model with the original IRM- concept which has so much stimulated this research. This concept still features in most textbooks of ethology; in spite of much criticism against all its aspects it obviously serves a need. Admittedly the IRM-concept is based on old and often obsolete data; an attempt to bring it to conform with our present knowledge and views seems therefore worthwhile. Since an excellent review of the historic development of the IRM- concept has been given by SCHLEIDT (1962, 1964) I shall restrict myself here to what I consider as the crucial points of that concept. It originates with VON UEXKULL (1909, 1928) who postulated that schematical (simplified) representations ('Schemata') of environmental situations would be present in the central nervous system, a concept reminiscent of JUNG'S archetypes (innately stored precursors of images appearing in dreams and halucinations and in a LAMARCKian way supposed to have been primarily derived from experience; JUNG, 1917; FEUERBORN, 1939). When LORENZ (1932) became aware of the fact that many animal species have developed in the course of evolution special structures and behaviour patterns for releasing in other (mostly conspecific) animals (reactors) particular responses from which at least the actor benefits, he coined the term 'Ausloser' (translated as 'social releaser'; THORPE, 1951; VERPLANCK, 1957) for such structures and acts. The 'Ausl6ser' were thought to be made up of a small number of'sign stimuli', characteristic for a particular object, state of an object, or, in general, stimulus situa- tion, to which a receptive correlate in the reactor ('angeborenes auslosendes Schema'; LORENZ, 1935) was conceived to be specifically sensitive. The terms 'schema' (and also 'correlate') suggest that a simplified template of the adequate situation was thought to be present somewhere in the information processing apparatus. This was indeed VON UEXKULL'S view, but in LORENZ'S conception (1937) the 'schema' consisted of a set of unconditioned reflexes, basically the idea we have ad- vocated here. This is why TINBERGEN (1939, 1942, 1948), when translating the German term 'angeborenes auslosendes Schema' into</page><page sequence="361">348 G. P. BAERENDS English, preferred to speak of 'innate releasing mechanism', and since LORENZ agreed with this change, in German usage also 'Schema' became replaced by 'Mechanismus'. Both LORENZ and TINBERGEN realized (see LORENZ, 1978) that the pro- cess of heterogeneous summation of the information received, thought to take place in the releasing mechanism (SEITZ, 1940; LORENZ, 1943), was difficult to reconcile with the idea of comparing the stimulus situation perceived with a preformed template. Consequently LORENZ has always maintained (LORENZ, 1935, 1978) that, when an animal was found to re- spond to a complex configurational stimulus, it could be taken for granted that an innate releasing mechanism was not involved. In his latest book he states (LORENZ, 1978, p. 136): "Es ist der Evolution des senso-neuralen Systems h6herer Tiere nicht m6glich, einen angeborenen, d.h. phylogenetisch programmierten Reiz-Empfangs- Apparat herzustellen, der selektiv auf Komplexqualititen anspricht. Dagegen aber ist es der erlernten Wahrnehmung von Gestalten ein Kleines, Reaktionen herzustellen, die mit ungeheuer, schier unglaub- licher Selektivitat auf komplexeste Konfigurationen ansprechen". (In the evolution of senso-neural systems of higher animals it has been impossible to produce innate, i.e. phylogenetically programmed stimulus receivers which selectively respond to complex stimulus qualities. In contrast, by way of learnt perceptions of 'Gestalt' it is a trifle to react with great, almost unbelievable selectivity to the most complex con- figuration.) With this statement LORENZ implicitly touched the question how and to which extent information about a specific external situation can be laid down in genes. However, LORENZ did not enter into this problem. In- stead he embarked on an extensive, partly philosophical discussion (LORENZ, 1943, p. 314-332) on the problem whether responsiveness to a 'Gestalt' or configurational relationship would always be due to a learn- ing process resulting from experience with the stimulus situation con- cerned, in contrast with a reaction mediated by an IRM. The opinion that complex configurational relationships ('Komplex- qualitaten') can only be established by learning, is shared by all in- vestigators. Controversial is whether this applies for any configuration that could be called a 'Gestalt'. In this discussion the definition of 'Gestalt' is obviously crucial. In the just given quotation from LORENZ he seems to identify 'Gestalt' with 'Komplexqualitat'. On the other hand he has also stated (LORENZ, 1960) that sign stimuli for which the releasing mechanism is sensitive have a configurational character and fit the</page><page sequence="362">GENERAL DISCUSSION 349 'Gestalt' concept of Gestalt psychologists (e.g. KOHLER, 1947). The latter is in agreement with a statement from TINBERGEN (1948b, p. 33) that sign stimuli are "complicated systems to which the term 'Gestalt' may rightly be applied; they are configurational stimuli". This view is easily understandable from the fact that in several experimental studies to analyse the sign stimuli for particular activities, TINBERGEN and his co- workers found a dependence of the effectiveness of some features on their relations with other ones. For instance, young thrushes appeared to direct their gaping responses preferably to that extension from the edge of a disc which, in proportion to that disc, had the same relative size as the head of the adult bird with respect to its body (TINBERGEN &amp; KUENEN, 1939). A second example was the above mentioned importance of the position of the red bill-spot of the herring gull for its effectiveness in evok- ing food begging. (TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK, 1950). A third case was the finding that in the threespined stickleback a red patch was maximally ef- fective when situated on the underside of a dummy (TER PELKWIJK &amp; TINBERGEN, 1937). Also the contrasting effects of the reaction of duck- lings of opposite movement directions of the well known hawk-goose model (LORENZ, 1939) was presented as an argument in support of a role of configurational relationships in an innate releasing mechanism. Sign stimuli of this type were thought to combine with other sign stimuli of the situation in accordance with the rule of heterogeneous summation. Therefore, on the basis of the available evidence and its current inter- pretation one cannot say that Gestalt or configurational stimuli do not play a role in 'innate releasing mechanisms' (one could, however, ques- tion whether the supposed configurational character of stimuli was always satisfactorily tested). TINBERGEN (1942, p. 70) has realized that a certain amount of contradiction seemed to exist between heterogeneous summation of sign stimuli and their configurational character of percep- tion. He concluded that the summation must take place at another place in the neural mechanism than the perceptual organization of the Gestalt. Thus, since LORENZ (1943) on the one hand accepted that sign stimuli may have a configurational nature and on the other hand denied any in- fluence of learning processes on the sensitivity to sign stimuli, he was forced to distinguish between simple unlearnt and complicated learnt configurational situations ('Gestalten'). The latter type he thought to consist of "undestructible interrelationships between a magnitude of elements". The former would concern simple relationships between few elements. LORENZ (1943) realized that this distinction was only gradual and that consequently a sharp distinction between responses to an 'innate</page><page sequence="363">350 G. P. BAERENDS releasing mechanism' and to a 'Gestalt' was impossible. He further stated (p. 331) "Aus irgendwelchen Griinden k6nnen offenbar nur wenige und einfache Gliederungen der Wahrnehmung in ihrer Bindung an bestimmte, durch sie ausgeloste Reaktionen vererbt werden, wahrend fur erworbenermassen reaktionausl6sende Wahrnehmungsgestalten eine obere Grenze des Komplikationsgrades so gut wie nicht besteht". The problems around the term 'Gestalt' clearly arose from the endeavour to discriminate between innate and learned information in the animal about its environment. The qualification 'innate', as used by LORENZ and TINBERGEN, was for the first time severely questioned by SCHNEIRLA (1952, 1956) and LEHRMAN (1953). The former authors meant to indicate with this adjective all knowledge or skill not acquired through experience with the adequate stimulus situation (LORENZ, 1961, 1965). Although this definition might suffice for comparative phylogenetical purposes, it is not valid when considering the genetical and developmen- tal aspects of behaviour. To answer questions in these fields - such as how information about environmental cues might be encoded in genes and whether such information could have a configurational character - a much more penetrating analysis would be necessary than had at that time been carried out. In the meantime this has been done for two of the examples given. SCHLEIDT (1961, 1962) has shown that the escape response of goslings, initially elicited by everything flying over their heads, soon becomes habituated to regularly observed objects moving, like the adult geese, in the direction to which a long stretched extension (neck) is pointing. Consequently the escape response remains to be elicited by objects moving in the reversed, short neck, direction, actually making it a reaction to relative novelty, or oddity in MUELLER'S sense (see p. 337). Therefore, the configurational aspect in this sign stimulus is not as such coded in the genes, but acquired through experience. The se- cond example in which a stimulus was prematurely interpreted as con- figurational, is the position of the red patch on the herring gull's bill. We have dealt with it above (p. 310); HAILMAN (1967) was able to show that the position of the patch only becomes a configurational feature after the chick has gained experience of its parents. IMPEKOVEN (1969) confronted naive black-headed gull chicks, hatched in an incubator in the dark, with differently patterned flat cardboard dummies of head and shoulders of a parent bird in the food presenting posture. The chicks approached a dummy more often, and pecked at it, when it showed a white body with a dark head and a dark bill than when it was bearing the opposite (negative) pattern or when it was entirely</page><page sequence="364">GENERAL DISCUSSION 351 white. Whether this should be considered as a case of Gestalt perception cannot be decided at the present state of research. These two examples should warn us that what to us appear as relation- ships between different stimuli need not have that character in the infor- mation processing of the animal concerned. Only when we know the physiological mechanism of the perception of a stimulus situation can we answer the question whether the animal is susceptible to the relationship itself. For instance, relationships like 'nearer' or 'further away', 'upper' or 'lower' may not be perceived as such, but be the result of the respond- ing animal always approaching the situation in a way standardized by the elicitation of responses earlier in a fixed behavioural chain (see also HAILMAN, 1971). As a consequence such stimuli may appear successive- ly, differ in strength perceived, or be differentiated by the animal in any other way than that in which we have interpreted them. Unconditioned reflexes, S-R links with special detectors, may be responsible for such reactions, which appear to us as responses to simple Gestalts. Moreover, as HAILMAN (1970) has remarked, the codification of all visual stimuli other than pure colour or brightness is to some degree configurational, but this statement does not necessarily imply that such configurations should be a close match of those we recognize in the adequate object in the natural environment. I would not be surprised, however, if LORENZ's intuition of a relation- ship between learning and Gestalt would be correct if amended in this way that learning processes always lead to the formation of Gestalts, but that what appears as a Gestalt to us need not necessarily be the result of a learning process. This very well fits the statement by LORENZ referred to above. Confusion results from identification of 'Komplexqualitat' with 'Gestalt' and 'stimulus configuration', from attempts to incorporate these concepts in the instinct vs learning dichotomy, and from identifying the actual cases entirely from the anthropomorphic perspective. It seems to me that our model can help to avoid these confusions, in particular by stimulating the development of differentiated versions adapted for every single case. SCHLEIDT (1962) has proposed to use the term releasing mechanism (RM) for all functional structures of an organism (the motor system exempted) which play an important part in eliciting a reaction. Only in case it has been proved that the RM did not develop under the influence of experience with the adequate object he wants to speak of'in- nate releasing mechanism' (IRM). If, on the contrary, it has been ex- perimentally shown that the linkage between the stimulus situation was</page><page sequence="365">352 G. P. BAERENDS entirely acquired, SCHLEIDT wants to speak of an acquired releasing mechanism (ARM). He proposed the term IRME (innate releasing mechanism modified by experience) for a combined effect of genetically transmitted and acquired information in the adaptation to the external situation involved. SCHLEIDT only wants to use this term when it has been proved that the IRM is still functioning as a skeleton of the IRME. He is of opinion that in experienced vertebrates the IRME is the rule. Although LORENZ (1935, 1937a, b) always recognized the existence of combinations of 'innate' and 'acquired' elements in a chain of activities, his concept of 'Instinkt-Dressurverschrinkung' rather concerns the coupling of an 'innate' to an acquired unit than the formation of a unit through interaction of genetic and acquired information, as suggested in the IRME-concept. In case of the linkage of an 'innate' motor pattern with a learned situation, LORENZ even spoke of conditioned instinctive ac- tivity, in analogy to the conditioned reflex. HAILMAN - who pioneered in relating the phenomena ascribed to the 'releasing mechanism' to a coding for the perception of specific stimuli characterizing particular stimulus situations in an animal's environment, by means of neural units in the receptor field organization of sensory systems, i.e. single neurons with properties isomorphic to these stimuli- has suggested that: "the coding for stereotyped, species-common stimulus choices could be organized differently from the coding that underlies learnable discriminations; or that, at least a continuum of coding schemes exists of which these two are the end-points". (HAILMAN, 1970, p. 146). The model resulting from our experiments on 'egg recognition' is in fact a model for an IRME in SCHLEIDT'S sense. It is, however, my hope that this model should do more than confirm this IRME concept. My in- tention is to stimulate research on the problem how and in what form in the course of phylogeny information about the environment can be stored in the genes and how in the course of ontogeny this code is deciphered. The LoRENzian distinction between information about an external situa- tion incorporated through the phylogenetical mechanism of mutation and selection and through individual learning from experience with the ade- quate situation (LORENZ, 1961, 1965) should not lead to erroneous exclu- sion of learning processes of any kind in the way genes are conceived to come to expression. It is often overlooked that by the use of the term 'in- nate' more questions are raised than answered; building models like the present ones can help to state these questions and thus promote research to answer them.</page><page sequence="366">GENERAL DISCUSSION 353 LORENZ'S (1978) 'rule of thumb', saying that an IRM must be involved when an organism reacts to a dummy in which the stimulus configura- tions of the adequate object are only roughly represented, but that recognition of a learnt complex Gestalt is entailed if an exact imitation is needed to elicit the reaction, may not be interpreted to the effect that ac- quired information would never be processed through heterogeneous summation. This may be concluded from the present study as well as from a few other studies published earlier. In the following this will be briefly explained. In 11.7. we have argued that information about size, colour, speckling and shape is processed in accordance with the rule of heterogeneous sum- mation. Whereas the evaluation of the first three types of features can be independent of experience with the adequate object, the different latency characteristics make it likely that knowledge of the proper egg shape is learnt. Heterogeneous summation of learnt information has been more directly shown in experiments with a pig-tailed monkey (Macaca nemestrina) carried out by BAERENDS, BRIL &amp; BULT (1965). In a 'Wisconsin Choice Test Apparatus' the monkey was first taught to look for food under a flat cover with a particular, moderately complicated design in which several elements, often with a configurational aspect, could be distinguished. These elements, as well as their combination, could be taken as novel to the animal. After conditioning had been achieved, the effectiveness of the different elements was measured in choice tests with transformed 'dummies' of the standard stimulus object, in which parts had been left out or changed. This method was essentially the same as the one used in our egg retrieval experiments. It turned out that the different elements of the conditioned pattern varied in their effectiveness in direc- ting the choice of the monkey and that the rule of heterogeneous summa- tion applied for the way in which the partial effectiveness of each of the different elements was combined for determining the total value of the dummies. In our model the mechanism of heterogeneous summation of the infor- mation received by a particular detector set is basic for assuring adequate visual response to various stimuli in situations with which the animals are unacquainted with these situations. It stands to reason that this mecha- nism prevails in short-lived animals, such as most invertebrates, and in young stages of longer living animals. Experienced vertebrates - but also invertebrates, for instance in landmark orientation - often use an information processing mechanism in which the situation perceived is compared with a learned template. As we have seen above, the acquisition</page><page sequence="367">354 G. P. BAERENDS of such templates is likely to be facilitated by the links with the detectors and the way they operate in sets varying in composition in dependance of the behavioural system(s) activated. This ontogenetic function of the mechanism of heterogeneous summa- tion is likely to be one reason why it was maintained in the course of phylogeny after the development of the much more reliable template mechanism. As another conceivable reason I suggest the difference between the latency characteristics of both mechanisms. At least in our experiments, choices based on primary S-R links were more rapidly made than choices for proper resemblance. A possibility to react rapidly - even at the risk of a number of false starts - must be of survival value to an animal, in particular when moreover the chance of a harmful response is considerably reduced through the inhibition of the input from the detectors, provided for in our model. On the other hand, a number of functions can be conceived for which heterogeneous summation would not work. One of these is the matching of an expectation with a feedback. The optimal situation in the nest-bowl necessary for the continuation of incubation: tactile stimulation of the three broodpatches with smooth elongated rounded objects of a certain size and of a temperature matching that of the adult gull, consists of com- ponents which are all essential. Functionally a deficiency in one of them cannot be compensated by an excesspf the other; for its proper function- ing the incubation act should not be sensitive to supernormality. Each of the set values of which the feedback information consists must be confin- ed between margin values. Further in eliciting a response internal and external information have been found to be mutually replaceable (BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATERBOLK, 1955). This is accounted for in the model by the input of the activated motivational system into the in- tegrator. The consequence of this input, that at high values of the rele- vant motivation deficient external situations can elicit a response (threshold lowering), is incompatible with the function of the control of a motor pattern, such as incubation, by means of an 'expected' feedback. On the contrary, when the motivation is high the animal should be op- timally sensitive to the feedback received; in Part I (II.C.3.) I have reported about data suggesting that this in fact holds true. It is well conceivable that the sensitivity to the value of each of the feed- back components required is present in the bird without experience. It should, however, not a priori be excluded that this sensitivity is, perhaps partly, built up during early experience with eggs. This could be one of the reasons why the first building attempts of the individual are often less successful.</page><page sequence="368">GENERAL DISCUSSION 355 Also when spatial and temporal patterns have to be compared heterogeneous summation cannot work. This, for instance, applies to landmark orientation or the identification of individuals. The term 'recognition' seems fit for reactions to such templates or relatively com- plicated configurations, but not for the end result of the heterogeneous summation process. This is why we consider it - as mentioned in the introduction (p. V) - less appropriate to call the present study one of 'egg recognition'. In a critical discussion of the IRM-concept the question should be rais- ed how by way of this mechanism the external stimulation contributes to the occurrence of a particular behaviour pattern. The adjective 'releas- ing' (but also other common alternatives such as triggering, eliciting, evoking and the original German term 'ausl6send') suggest that a specific potentiality to perform, hitherto blocked and 'waiting', is set free when the external stimulus is perceived. If so, the external and internal stimulation would contribute in essentially different ways. This indeed was LORENZ'S original view when he coined the term 'auslosendes Schema'. It fits his hydraulic model in which 'reaktionsspezifische Er- regungsstoff', a hypothetical action-specific substance, would in the course of time be accumulated to be metabolized during the performance of the activity, to which it had been made available through the effect of the external stimulus. Although there is a good deal of evidence - for in- stance from the causal analysis of incubation behaviour, see Part I - that the potentiality to react in a special way to an external stimulus is prepared by specific internal stimulation (activation of a motivational system) there is no conclusive evidence that this always happens in the same way or in one physiologically different from the ways in which the external stimulus exerts its effect. At our present state of knowledge it is not parsimonious to assume a priori a dichotomy in the way external and internal stimuli act on the motor control mechanism. It is therefore not advisable to use a terminology which leads to such a bias. This is the more true because external and internal stimulation can replace one another and since external stimulation has also been found to exert a priming effect on the internal tendency to perform a specific type of behaviour (VAN IERSEL, 1953), possibly in combination with triggering it. The problem of finding a proper name becomes even more com- plicated by the difficulty that, as TINBERGEN (1948b) has pointed out, some stimuli merely release the response without giving spatial guidance. The reverse - stimuli only directing a response - is also known, e.g. in orientation with respect to celestial characteristics, gravity, wind direc-</page><page sequence="369">356 G. P. BAERENDS tion, etc. When the releasing and the directing stimuli are not the same, and especially when they belong to different sensory modalities and are successively perceived, it may be practically possible to unravel the two effects of the natural situation. But a combination of release and direction by the same stimulus situation is also possible and in particular likely to occur when visual perception is involved. In such cases the two functions are very difficult if not impossible to separate. In our analysis of the egg- features involved in the retrieval response we have tried this by compar- ing the results of successive presentation of a single dummy with those of simultaneous presentations of two dummies. However, we found that the tendency to retrieve was in general too high for making in single presen- tations any discrimination demonstrable. With respect to the begging response in young gulls two authors, FRANCK (1966) and NYSTROM (1972) have made such a comparison be- tween the visual stimuli effective in successive and in simultaneous presentation of different dummies. FRANCK, working with black-headed gull chicks, and NYSTROM, working with herring gulls, both found the ef- fectiveness of colour to decrease in the order blue-red-yellow-grey in suc- cessive presentations as well as in presentations in pairs. In addition NYSTROM presented all 4 colours together and obtained the same result. In general, simultaneous presentation appeared to be more sensitive; ex- actly the same we found when comparing single with paired presenta- tions of dummies on the nest-rim. Any difference between the two methods is therefore likely to be due to the larger effect of threshold lowering on the results of successive presentations. These practical difficulties in separating releasing and directing effects make it undesirable to maintain the adjective 'releasing' in the concept. This term is also inappropriate when as the result of activation of the in- formation processing mechanism we are dealing with, a motivational system becomes activated (or is primed). It is a pity that the English terms 'releasing' and 'triggering' and the German term 'auslosend' are so commonly used in this context, as they are all suggestive of the idea that for the occurrence of the activity some internal tension is a prere- quisite. Perhaps the term 'eliciting' would be better, since it seems to include less bias about the underlying mechanism. It is clear from the above that the adjective 'innate' likewise cannot be maintained. SCHLEIDT (1962) has tried to compromise in the nomenclature he proposes, but I do not find his proposals satisfactory. 'Innate' and 'releasing' are still used in his terminology; this may en- courage classifications which do not correspond to reality. I would rather</page><page sequence="370">GENERAL DISCUSSION 357 plead for careful studies and descriptions of each information processing pathway in its own right. Let us remain open to the possibility that a diversity of mechanisms may occur. Properly documented descriptions will be of more use for bridging the gap between ethological analysis and behaviour physiology than attempts for neat classifications in theoretical- ly based categories.</page><page sequence="371">CHAPTER 6 SUPERNORMALITY To my knowledge the term 'supernormal' (or rather 'superoptimal' or 'uiberoptimal') was introduced by TINBERGEN. In print I found it used for the first time with respect to the stimuli releasing sexual pursuit flights in males of the greyling butterfly (TINBERGEN, MEEUSE, BOEREMA &amp; VAROSSIEAU, 1942). The effectiveness of models in releasing this activi- ty was found to increase with their darkness and their size, also when these surpassed the natural values of these features. This paper mentions, and TINBERGEN has repeated this a number of times, that KOEHLER &amp; ZAGARUS (1937) had earlier reported a case of preference for an abnorm- ally looking dummy over the normal adequate object. These authors were themselves extremely brief on this observation. They merely stated that a ringed plover, to which various kinds of egg dummies were offered from time to time, retrieved a white-speckled one before its own egg ('hatte gelegentlich das allerdings ungemein augenfallige weissgetupfelte den Vorzug vor Halsbandeiern', p. 8). The paper gives no further information about the experiments concerned. In his 'Study of Instinct' TINBERGEN (1951, p. 44) gives a picture of the egg dummy he supposed KOEHLER to have used. Professor TINBERGEN recently informed me that this figure was made after a draw- ing Professor KOEHLER kindly sent to him. Surprisingly, on this picture the dummy was white with dark speckles; it does not bear a 'negative' pattern, as has to be concluded from the German text. In the greyling paper, TINBERGEN makes mention of his observations on preference for oversized eggs in the herring gull. The same preference he later also found in oystercatchers (TINBERGEN, 1948a). Further TINBERGEN &amp; PERDECK (1950) managed to enlarge the effectiveness of a red patch on a flat cardboard dummy in eliciting responses of herring gull chicks by subdividing it. By means of a white ring they divided the patch in a central spot and an outer ring. Similarly a red rod with three white rings at the end, interrupting the red, also obtained a greater number of responses than a control without rings. Moreover these authors succeeded in increasing the attractivity of the bill itself by making it unnaturally slender. These various examples made TINBERGEN (1951, p. 46) plead for a closer investigation of the phenomenon of the responsiveness to 'super- normal' stimulation. Only a few examples have been added since. QUINE &amp; CULLEN (1964) found the preference of the arctic tern chicks for the head-part of fish dummies provided with an eye spot to increase with the size of that spot.</page><page sequence="372">GENERAL DISCUSSION 359 The largest eye spot presented had an external diameter of 12 mm, which is larger than normal for the kind of fish fed to the young. MAGNUS (1954, 1958) found that in the males of the fritillary butterfly (Argynnis paphia) the sexual pursuit flight was also relatively more often released by over- sized than by normally sized dummies. Moreover, a dummy of a pure orange colour (Ostwald pa, 3-5; see I, Fig. 4) was more effective than a dummy covered with real wings (which bear a pattern of thin black lines and small black patches). Finally in these butterflies the percentage response to a dummy which alternately showed orange and black strips, adhered to a rotating cylinder, increased with the frequency of this rota- tion. This was true even when the normal frequency of wing flapping was surpassed, providing that the frequency where optical fusion of the two types of strips could be expected to occur in the butterfly's visual system was not reached. A third example comes from a study by GOODWIN &amp; HESS (1969c) on preferences shown by young domestic chicks in unrewarded pecking responses at small white geometrical forms on a black background. A ser- rated circle was found to obtain more pecks than actual grains and the at- tractiveness of the circle could be further enlarged by exchanging the pointed cogs on the periphery of the circle for half circles, for full circles or for square cogs, the effectiveness increasing in this order. The problem of the sensitivity to supernormal stimulus situations is particularly interesting because of the considerable number of cases suggested to occur in our own species (LORENZ, 1943). Only a few of these suggestions, the 'baby face' and the 'laughing face' have been experimentally investigated. GARDNER &amp; WALLACH (1965) and HUCKSTEDT (1965) were able to demonstrate that schematized pictures in which typical characteristics of a babyhead had been exaggerated beyond normal, scored higher when rated by a panel of persons than normally shaped images. SCHMIDT (1957) has shown, with a series of drawings representing a laughing face in different variations of completeness, that for the response to a laugh the mechanism of heterogeneous summation holds, and - as cartoon artists already knew for a long time - that the best laughing effect is achieved by exaggerating some special features (such as size and curvature of the mouth and the skin folds radiating from the mouth corners) beyond normal. However, beside these scientific at- tempts to study the phenomenon of supernormality, the reality of its ex- istence in Man is supported by its common utilization in fashion designs, in the application of make up and for eye-catchers in advertisements. We are sensitive to supernormal stimuli despite our highly developed capacities of visual perception, memorizing and reasoning.</page><page sequence="373">360 G. P. BAERENDS This apparently controversial coexistence of responsiveness to super- normal sign stimuli and to detailed perceptions can be understood on the basis of our model, as has been discussed above. However, the question should be raised whether all features triggering detectors connected with a selector unit possess the potentiality to evoke a supernormality response, or only features with special characteristics. Of those features which in the egg-retrieval study could be exaggerated to supernormal ef- fectiveness, the egg-size and the number, darkness, smallness and con- trast of spots with the groundcolour can all be measured on a continuous scale, which at one end - for most features the upper, but for spot size the lower end - reaches considerably beyond the naturally occurring values. This also holds for the size and the frequency of wing flapping of the butterflies mentioned and probably also when a sensitivity for curvatures exists, such as found in the responsiveness of a human baby to details in a face (FANTZ, 1958, 1961, 1963; FANTZ &amp; MIRANDA, 1975). It also applies for the purity of the orange colour in the fritillary butterfly. However, it does not seem to apply in cases where a naturally present wavelength is rated lower than an unnatural one, such as in the preference for the green egg. Since green is at the top of the luminosity curve it could be con- sidered as the open end of a continuum if instead of a real preference for wavelength one for brightness were involved. However, contradicting this interpretation, green was preferred over all greys and the brightest grey (white) did not obtain the highest score (II.4.2.). Consequently a ge- nuine colour preference must be involved. We should therefore consider whether the green hue preferred could be taken as being situated on a common continuum with the natural egg colours. As was stated in I.3.A.e. Fig. 4, the pure colours 23, 24, 1, 2 en 3, varying from light green to yellow ochre, are basic to the groundcolours of the eggs. The egg colours can be derived from them by mixing one of these colours with quantities of black and white. Consequently the supernormal green can indeed be conceived of as nearer to the open end of a scale (varying from the bottom to the top in Fig. 3) on which also the natural egg colours have a position. The explanation for the occurrence of supernormality in reactions to colour evokes an association of the supernormality phenomenon with that of 'peak shift'. The latter stems from work in experimental psychology and, whereas supernormality is always thought to be due to innate characteristics, peak shift is the result of a special learning procedure. When animals are trained to respond positively to one particular value on</page><page sequence="374">GENERAL DISCUSSION 361 a continuum and simultaneously to avoid another value, a shift of the maximum response rate occurs, from the positive training value towards that side of the continuum which is opposite to the negative one. HANSON (1957) found this effect when training with this procedure pigeons on wavelength, and HOGAN, KRUIJT &amp; FRIJLINK (1975) found it in ex- periments with pigeons trained in discrimination of patterns with a par- ticular number of speckles. In these latter experiments peak shift occur- red during extinction in pigeons which learned to distinguish 37 speckles as the positive and 21 speckles as the negative stimulus, but not when absence of speckles was used as the negative sign. When BAERENDS, BRIL &amp; BULT (1965), in their experiments with the pigtail monkey (see 11.7.8.), did not succeed in designing any supernor- mally effective dummy for the learnt stimulus object, they concluded that sensitivity to a supernormal stimulus would be a consequence of ex- clusively non-learnt S-R links. It is now clear, however, that it must have been due to the fact that the features of the training object had been learnt in an absolute sense and not as relative values on a continuum. In the latter case generalization will go in one direction of the continuum, in the former generalization will be diffuse. We should, therefore, be open to the possibility that sensitivity to supernormality can result from a special learning programme. Such a particular learning programme could conceivably be superimposed on S-R links, as suggested above for learning processes in general. It may be especially important to realize this when trying to understand the causation of sensitivity to super- normal situations in our own species. It is worth noting here that a combined positive training for one value with a negative training for another on the same scale may even lead to peak shift along the visual part of the spectrum and thus cause a preference for one spectral colour to merge into another which we would be inclined to call qualitatively different (GUTMAN &amp; KALISH, 1956, 1958). Whatever the cause of positive reactions to supernormal situations, they always result from a preference for stronger over weaker stimula- tion. Probably reacting positively to strong stimuli is in general more liable to be harmful than reacting to weaker ones. One may therefore wonder in how far selection against responsiveness to supernormal stimuli, or for mechanisms protecting the animal against its possible harmful effects, is likely to have taken place. I have already mentioned that the inhibitive effect exerted upon the primary S-R links by a tenden- cy to flee is such a protective mechanism. Moreover, the fact that in the release of most responses more than one S-R link are simultaneously or</page><page sequence="375">362 G. P. BAERENDS successively playing a role, will reduce the amount of dangerous and/or energy wasting, erroneous, responses. Further we should also be aware that under natural conditions an animal is not very likely to encounter highly supernormal stimulus situations. However, we should perhaps not too readily assume that reaction to supernormal situations is unadaptive. It is worth asking whether a certain amount of sensitivity for supernormal stimulation may be of selective advantage to an animal. Returning to our findings in the herring gull, selection against under- sized eggs is undoubtedly functional. As stated in 1.4. the viability of a chick is positively correlated with the size of the egg from which it has hatched (PARSONS, 1976). It is not unlikely to be of advantage for a bird, which happens to have laid one or two undersized eggs, to abandon this clutch and start a new one. The tendency to prefer oversized eggs, which is the consequence of a mechanism discriminating against eggs of small sizes only, cannot do much harm since another factor, the size of the bird, puts an upper limit to egg-size. The preference for many, small and contrasting speckles I am inclined to consider as a physiological phenomenon which must have promoted the development of camouflage patterns on eggs. Camouflaged eggs will not only be less frequently detected by visually searching predators than plain coloured ones, but, as shown in III.1.2., they provide a better stimulus for incubation behaviour. Gulls providing poorly pigmented eggs can therefore be expected to guard and attend their clutches on the average less well than the owners of speckled eggs. In I.4.a. we have given arguments that the production of spots on eggs is dependent on genetic control; anatomically and physiologically control of the amount of spots on the shell seems possible through regulating the transport of porphyrins from the oviduct into the uterus. The producers of poorly speckled eggs themselves, and their mates, will through the reduction of care for such eggs actively lessen the chance of this feature being pro- pagated. As a result the evolution of the pigmentation of the eggs is steered towards the further development of speckling patterns (BAERENDS, 1959). One might see it as a pre-adaptation to the develop- ment of a cryptic pattern. As stated by STADDON (1975), a natural selec- tion pressure, which is asymmetrical with respect to a stimulus con- tinuum, such as selection against small sizes or poorly speckled patterns, leads to preference for supernormality in a way analogous to peak shift in learning. The difference is that in the former case avoidance of one side of the continuum is due to a phylogenetic process but in the latter to a special learning procedure.</page><page sequence="376">GENERAL DISCUSSION 363 One may wonder whether all birds possess a high responsiveness to a speckled pattern. In the Copenhagen-Zoo POULSEN (1953) did some retrieval tests with a bean goose (Anserfabialis), a condor (Vultur gryphus), and a domestic pigeon (Columbus lecudophyrrhus) which all have plain col- oured eggs. There was a distinct trend to retrieve the own eggs before eggs with spots painted on them. Some birds refused dummies with speckles, others only took them after a considerable delay. Thus these results do certainly not support the idea that all birds might prefer spotted over plain patterns. However, the number of tests made by POULSEN is small, while his design does not seem very consistent and is not easily comparable with our own. Moreover, there is the possibility that the tests were all made before the bird was well adapted to the procedure, at a time thus when in our experiment choices based on learned knowledge about the appearance of the own eggs would prevail over decisions based on supernormality. In an earlier phase of this study we have for some time entertained the idea that supernormality would just be due to a high responsiveness of the uninhibited animal to all stimuli of high physical strengths. We now believe that this only holds true for the set of S-R links originally attached to the selector unit of the particular response concerned. Thus, if POULSEN'S data are comparable with ours, some species would have primarily S-R links with detectors sensitive to spotted patterns - which means that for this character supernormal dummies can be made - and other species would lack them. At the end of this chapter one may wonder whether the term 'super- normal stimulus' is a good one which should be maintained. In German 'iiberoptimal', thus 'superoptimal' is commonly used. 'Superoptimal' suggests, more than does 'supernormal', that a response to an exag- gerated stimulus would be less advantageous. Considering the positive effect supernormality may have in evolution from the ultimate point of view, 'superoptimal' does not seem to be a better term.</page><page sequence="377">CHAPTER 7 ON THE NATURE OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS (co-author: R. H. DRENT) In 11.7 it was concluded that the data we collected on the way in which in- formation on different egg features was combined by the gull fit the prin- ciple of heterogeneous summation as formulated by SEITZ (1940). We felt, however, that the methods by which these data have been obtained, and consequently also their degree of exactitude, did not allow more precise statements about the mathematical character of the 'summation' procedure. However, since a few authors did attempt to penetrate further into the mechanisms underlying the decisions when a choice between ob- jects has to be made, it seems fit to dedicate a chapter to a discussion comparing their ideas and results as far as possible with our findings. The first problem to be discussed should be the causation of minority choices. This is crucial since DAWKINS (1969a, b) has tried to explain their occurrence in an entirely different way. The second point concerns the question whether the weight of different features in the information processing procedure is equal or not. Thirdly, JANDER'S (1968) effort to develop a mathematical model for the combination of information com- ponents in a teleotactic choice should be considered. Fourthly, the pro- blem will be raised how the actual comparison between the stimulus values of the different objects may take place and in what way interfering variables, such as the motivational state of the animal, might influence its outcome. Finally, the possible implication of DAWKINS' mathematical models for distinguishing between the releasing and directing effects of stimuli will be discussed. a. How are minority choices caused? Only rarely in our experiments (experiment stands for all tests made with the same pair of dummies) one particular dummy was in all tests always preferred over the other. This is why we distinguished between majority choices (i.e. preferences for the dummy retrieved first in the majority of tests in which this dummy was competing with the same alternative dum- my) and minority choices (first choices for that alternative). Minority choices were sometimes consistent and could then be attributed to a special motivational state of the bird: a tendency to escape interfering with incubation behaviour.</page><page sequence="378">GENERAL DISCUSSION 365 The most frequent cause for inconsistent minority choices was the in- fluence of a dominating position preference. However, we cannot ex- clude that other causes too have contributed to inconsistent minority choices in some of our tests. One possibility is that in a number of tests the first dummy was chosen randomly. As only circa 5 % of the minority choices in all tests carried out in all categories could not be identified as (A) i CHOOSE A or B or C thresholds CHOOSE A or B of stimuli .B1 CHI variable V // NO CHOICE sampling - __ I I I I I I instants time- SWITCH TO random CD oCu 100% SHAPE P ..

At 'sampling' instants whose frequency is independent of V, choices are made according to the rule that probability of being chosen is equally divided between all stimuli whose thresholds are at that instant exceeded by V" (from DAWKINS, 1969a: 121). Fig. 70b. The essence of DAWKINS' Attention Threshold Model. Three systems are shown, and the sequence (dominance order) is from left to right, culminating in the casting vote system, here represented by a random choice generator (by definition a 50% choice when two objects are involved as in this example). Depending on the state of the in- ternal variable, a choice between the two competing objects may be reached on the basis of colour, or there may occur an attention switch whereby the animal considers only shape, or finally the casting vote system may be invoked. Note that internal variable state can also lead to no choice (and hence a shift to other behaviour). Depending on the level of the internal variable, the animal may enter the sequence at the second or third system directly without having passed through colour (simplified from DAWKINS, 1969b: 135).</page><page sequence="379">366 G. P. BAERENDS consistent choices or position preferences, the number of random retrievals cannot have exceeded that percentage. It probably was less, since it almost never occurred that the results in a series of consecutive tests would only be explained by means of random selection. In contrast, the occurrence of random choice plays an essential part in the 'Choice Threshold Model' developed by DAWKINS (1969a) for ex- plaining the occurrence of minority decisions in choice tests between two objects. This model (Fig. 70a) strongly reminds one of the LoRENzian model for the releasing process. The choice is thought to be determined by the value of the external stimulation (i.e. that of each of the objects presented) and an internal fluctuating variable (V). If V is low no choice occurs. If V rises above a particular threshold and stays below a second one the animal always chooses the same object, thus displaying a consis- tent preference. If, however, V passes the second threshold the choices are randomly made; as a consequence the animal becomes less fastidious or - in LORENZ'S sense - its threshold for the external situation is lowered. For an experiment in which three stimuli, A, B and C, are presented in all possible pair combinations DAWKINS deduces the prediction PAC = 2(PAB + PBC-PAB PBC) - 1, in which P gives the percentage of choices that goes to the object first mentioned in the index when presented in competition with the second mentioned one. By means of this equation DAWKINS compares the explanatory value of his model with the alternative possibility that each object, independently of the other, has its own fixed stimulating value. According to the latter model, called the 'Product Rule', the prediction would correspond to the formula PAC = PAB PBC/PABPBC + QAB QBC), in which Q= 1-P. The com- parison is made on data collected by DAWKINS himself on pecking of domestic chicks at colour stimuli and on various data from the literature. It tends to support the Choice Threshold Model, though not conclusively. The outcome of similar calculations on our data on choices between dummies of different size and different colour did not allow us to distinguish between the two models. As DAWKINS himself points out, some predictions of the contending models are in fact algebraically iden- tical. The quantitative outcomes of those cases which are distinctive turn- ed out in our data set to be scarcely distinguishable. However, the method followed in collecting our data ('playing chess with the gull') does not accord with the conventions strictly necessary if one is to test the DAWKINS model rigorously. In out approach the treatment of pooled data on the choice outcome when two dummies are offered was secondary to</page><page sequence="380">GENERAL DISCUSSION 367 the attempt to understand each separate decision in the sequence of trials each bird underwent. Nevertheless one aspect of our data apparently fits the Choice Threshold Model. As shown in 11.6.5. and Figs 35-44 consistent choices were correlated with ir and On, thus low values of the tendency to retrieve, which could stand for V in DAWKINS' model. Tests, with 2r and In did show an increase of minority choices, but this was not due to ran- dom retrievals, as the Choice Threshold Model would predict, but to an increased influence of position preference. It is worth investigating whether this might be explained with a second model developed by DAWKINS (1969b): the Attention Threshold Model. This model is based on the assumption that with respect to drawing the attention of the animal the different features of a situation are unequal. b. Are different types of features equally treated in information pro- cessing? The Attention Threshold Model, given in Fig. 70b, is actually a further development of the Choice Threshold Model. In it DAWKINS assumes that when V has passed the second threshold the animal changes the criterion or feature by which it is making its decision, instead of staying in a phase of random choice or 'suprathreshold indecision'. For each criterion DAWKINS assumes a specific modification of the variable V, which can pass two thresholds. The essential feature of his Attention Threshold Model is that once the internal variable transgresses the upper threshold to enter what in terms of the modality concerned represents the area of in- decision (the zone of 50-50 choice in the original formulation of the more restricted 'choice threshold model') the actions are suspended and the outcome of the choice relegated to the next modality up in the selection hierarchy. In the context of the new modality (in Fig. 70b represented by the shift from colour to shape) a decision may be reached, at this point completely independent of the features of the stimulus object relevant to the first or any other modality, again dependent on the state of the inter- nal variable. If the variable should anew exceed the upper threshold the next modality is resorted to and so on. Basic to the model is the inclusion of a final arbiter in the form of a 50-50 choice maker, taking over the role of 'suprathreshold indecision' in the simpler model and thus dealing with any sequences that have escaped a decision on the basis of a specific modality. Paradoxically, the DAWKINS model makes no provision for an assessment of a stimulus object by systematic evaluation of the stimulus value in a number of modalities with subsequent integration into a total.</page><page sequence="381">368 G. P. BAERENDS As construction of logic it is virtually inassailable on account of the inclu- sion of the final randomizer, but it may be worth stressing that the only feature of the decision-making process as visualized by DAWKINS that is directly testable is the contention that most decisions (as distinct from the randomly generated ones emanating from the 'vote-casting system') will be single-modality decisions and it is on this point that we have scrutiniz- ed our own data. To find out whether this hypothesis would also apply to our data we have to investigate whether the gulls indeed came to their decisions by way of checking successively different criteria in a hierarchical order. The answer can be obtained by looking at the choices of successive tests in a series. Fig. 71 gives 5 examples. Series (a) concerns size and shape; all dummies are brown and speck- led. In tests 131 and 132 the gull rates 12RC (cylinder with rounded edges, size 12) above the egg-shaped dummy of size 11, but in 133 and 134 below egg-shape combined with size 12. According to the Rule of Heterogeneous Summation the gull would have made the calculation: (size 12 + egg-shape) &gt; (size 12 + cylinder-shape). However, one could also explain this series in accordance with the Attention Threshold Model, assuming that choices on size have priority over choices on shape, since in 133 and 134 choice on size is not possible. In series (b), also made with brown speckled dummies in which size and shape were varied, the tests 305, 306 and 307 demonstrated the preference of the gull for the larger sized dummy, in spite of abnormal shape. When the sizes are equal, however, the egg-shape is preferred (307). This series would also be explicable with both hypotheses; in case of the Attention Threshold Model again with a priority of size over shape. In series (c) size, colour (brown, green) and shape were varied. This gull had a strong preference for the left position, which remained cons- tant during the series (340, 344). Green 8 proved to be more effective than brown 10, provided the dummy was egg-shaped (339/340, 343/344) and not block-shaped (341). The latter dummy (8RBGr), however, was only able to break the position preference when brown 5 instead of brown 6 was laying on the preferred site. It is clear that here position preference is not acting as a 'casting vote system'. It can be overruled by other criteria but, most importantly, with the extent to which these criteria were present here only by several (size 8, green, egg-shape) in combination. In test 341 size alone does not suf- fice, it has to be combined with egg-shape (339 and 343).

P. BAERENDS 339 and 340 show that (with the size range used) the green groundcolour is needed. Comparison of 341 and 342 emphasize that position and dum- my are effective in combination. From this series it is clear that the criteria are not being cheked one by one successively in a fixed hierar- chical order. Series (d) reveals a strong preference for the left position (around MPR = 3.5). When size 6 in in the favoured position this preference is broken by size 12 (400), and also by 8-green, provided this dummy is egg-shaped (402, 403). Finally in series (e) an increase of the density of speckling overruled the effect of the green groundcolour (304, 305, 307). A real egg, however, surpassed the value of even a densely speckled egg-shaped dummy of size 8. Summarizing, we have come to the conclusion that the decision made by the gulls in our retrieval tests can generally not be explained by DAWKINS' Choice Threshold and Attention Threshold Models. Our main arguments to reject these models for our purpose are the following. First, our data force us to believe that for its decision the gull evaluates different features simultaneously. Decisions never seem to be made on the basis of one of the features only, as would be the consequence of the Attention Threshold Model. Generally the course of the decisions in a series of tests conflicts with the idea that the animal would give priority to different features in succession and in a fixed hierarchical order. Second, our data show that in decisions for egg-retrieval the features do not contribute in an all-or-none way, as presumed in DAWKINS' models, but on the basis of a gradual scale, corresponding with quan- titative aspects of the features. Measuring the values of a particular posi- tion preference would not have been possible if the Attention Threshold Model would have been valid for the procedure by which decisions were made in our tests. In our opinion our data point to the determination of the value of an object for inducing an incubation response through a process of simultaneous combination of the partial values of the features for which the selector of that response is sensitive (see V.4.), independently of each other, followed by a weighing of total values thus obtained for each object. We found the effectiveness of different types of features to vary with their qualitative and quantitative aspects over ranges which may for dif- ferent categories of features considerably overlap or even may cover each other. For the three categories of features which can be supernormally ef-</page><page sequence="384">GENERAL DISCUSSION 371 fective, colour, speckling and size, we have no basis whatsoever to place them in a rank order of relative effectiveness. The effectiveness of shape - a probably learnt feature - seemed to have a lower effectiveness when the bird was at ease, but could overrule the other three features when the tendency to escape became activated. With this phenomenon we have taken account in our model described in chapter 4 of this section. For a comparison of the relative effectiveness of different kinds of stimulation, taking into account the intensity at which they may occur, one should compare such stimuli on a basis of equal sensation (STEVENS, 1970). To my knowledge this has so far only been done in humans. In animals such comparisons only seem possible by a combination of ethological and physiological techniques. The difficulty to apply DAWKINS' models in case of the decisions made in egg-retrieval should not be taken to imply that a processing mechanism as underlying these models would nowhere occur. Consider- ing the kind of behaviour for which DAWKINS has tried his models, one may wonder if they would particularly hold for responses to little specified situations in an introductory phase of explanatory behaviour. It should be admitted that the idea of an attention shift repeatedly oc- curred to us when considering particular sets of data. In a number of cases in which the decision of a gull temporarily deviated from the general picture, the best explanation we could think of was that these gulls would have focussed their attention on another criterion than was usually done. Such cases particularly occurred when a choice had to be made between two dummies which both strongly differed from the real egg, but also did not possess definitely repellent features. Examples are the presentation of a yellow and a blue dummy (see 11.4.3.) and a number of combinations in the Li-Me-Da-Bla series, especially such in which in each of the dummies some features were represented in high and others in low rated representations (e.g. positive pattern and low contrast in one dummy and a negative pattern and high contrast in the other; see 11.5.3.). Such cases often led to position preference, suggesting that the bird did not manage to decide on basis of the dummies. However, if a bird in such a situation did show a consistent dummy preference, neither the rapid decision on the basis of the primary S-R link nor a decision on the basis of resemblance could be involved. Athird method of decision making seemed to be put into action, in which the bird seemed to mobilize and try several possibilities of its various kinds of knowledge to come to a decision. Of all three processes the latter one seems to come closest to a weighed evaluation.</page><page sequence="385">372 G. P. BAERENDS c. Which formal procedure underlies heterogeneous summation? Accepting the principle of heterogeneous combination of different stimulus components of a situation JANDER (1968, 1971) has made an at- tempt to penetrate deeper into the mathematical nature of the procedure involved. His work concerns the teleotactic choice between two relatively simple stimulus situations in a number of widely different species of ar- thropods. He first developed a method for determining a ratio scale of the stimulatory values for the teleotactic response to a series of similar stimulus objects varying on one dimension only. Second he compared the values on the ratio scale of two series of objects differing consistently in one aspect. Presence (or absence) of that aspect was found to change the value of an object in an additive way, but the effect was found to be stronger when applied to an object of lower than of higher value in the same series. JANDER therefore concludes that the 'heterogeneous summa- tion' of different aspects does not have the character of a simple mathematical addition but of addition in combination with compression. He found STEVENS' (1961) power function to describe this process satisfactorily. Consequently he proposes to replace the term 'rule of heterogeneous summation' for 'power principle of terminal cumulation of different stimulus components'. The deviations due to 'compression' are small. Taking into account that the response studied by JANDER, his stimulus objects and the test- situation were all so much simpler than in our egg-retrieval experiments, and that consequently the exactitude and statistical validity of the measurements largely differ, a verification of JANDER'S conclusion by means of our data is beyond reach. The random deviations of the values of the various dummies measured in our experiments on 'heterogeneous summation' (Fig. 54) were too large for being able to reveal a compres- sion effect of the order JANDER found. If present it certainly did not disturb in practice the application of maximum projection ratios in deter- mining differences between positions or between dummies. JANDER's method for establishing a ratio scale of stimulatory values in- cludes a transformation for eliminating the influence of responses not based on comparison of the stimulus objects (e.g. position preference, change of motivation, random choice). Like ourselves and in contrast to DAWKINS' models, he assumes that in principle weighed choices occur. Random choices, when occurring are therefore most likely to represent failures in interpretation. LEONG (1969) studied the cumulative effects of stimulus components in the cichlid fish Haplochromis burtoni by</page><page sequence="386">GENERAL DISCUSSION 373 measuring the attack increments associated with presentation of dum- mies to territorial males. Only two components were found to have any significant effects: a vertical bar in the head pattern, increasing the attack readiness by 2.79 bites/min, and an orange patch above the pectoral fin decreasing it by 1.77 bites/min. When presented together in one dummy, these patterns elicited an attack increment of 1.08 bites/min, indicating that 'the effects of these colour markings were combined in a simple ad- ditive fashion. In a follow-up to this study, HEILIGENBERG, KRAMER &amp; SCHULZ (1972) varied the orientation of the vertical bar (the 'eye-bar') by mounting a movable bar on the dummy like the arm of a clock, and found that the increment in attack rate could be interpreted quantitative- ly as the simple addition of an increment depending solely on the orienta- tion of the eye-bar with respect to the body axis, and an independent in- crement depending only on the orientation of the body axis with respect to gravity. In their discussion these authors point out that a multiplicative interrelation is not ruled out by the data presented, but refer to work in progress as supporting the simpler hypothesis of what they term the 'ad- ditive superposition' of the two stimulus properties. HEILIGENBERG (1976) subsequently reported on these supplementary experiments, and con- cluded that a multiplicative process was the most likely candidate after all. The total effect of the dummy fish could thus be described as the sum of a factor describing the effect of the orange spot plus the sum of the pro- duct of the two interacting components of the eye-bar (the orientation of the eye-bar in relation to the body, and the orientation of the body in relation to gravity). CURIO (1975) returns to the formalisms erected by HEILIGENBERG et al. to describe the alternative modes of combination when he discusses and again favours summation over a multiplicative process, but points out that the precision of response measurement almost always precludes the exclusion of slight multiplicative effects. In his monograph CURIO (1975) collates an immense amount of experimental material on the mobbing response of the parent pied flycatcher when con- fronted with dummy predators near the nest. The main emphasis in his study was the question of species specificity (his results leading to the for- mulation of a 'multichannel hypothesis') but some of the experiments im- pinge on the concept of heterogeneous summation, and in particular on the modes of combination of the stimulus values of component parts of the whole. Although eminently suited to detect which component features of the predator in question are the most effective in eliciting mobbing, the dummy series is not suited for evaluating each component both with and without the others and hence a quantitative approach to</page><page sequence="387">374 G. P. BAERENDS how the component features contribute to the total value of the complete dummy is beyond reach. Although there are indications that the sum of the parts may even be less than the sum of the individual stimulus values (for which effect CURIO coins the term response dilation) this effect can- not be taken to be proven rigorously. Beyond grappling with the problem of how the response strength values of stimulus features are combined in a mathematical sense, CURIO also takes up and extends a point he earlier discussed in a more preliminary fashion (CURIO, BLAICH &amp; RIEDER, 1969) namely the problem of bridging the gap between the response measurements the observer records and the underlying motivational analogues the observer would wish to ascertain. The method followed, tending to support the supposition implicit in most of this work that there is a linear relation between response strength and motivational level, although ingeneous, cannot avoid the pitfall mentioned by LEONG (1969), namely the influence of the necessarily arbitrary scale used to measure response strength in the first instance. Clearly we are still far from being able to equate response strength increments to increments in motiva- tional arousal, and must search for characterization of response strength in terms of a continuum that can be calibrated by testing the animal in another context. In closing this excursion into the literature on heterogeneous summation a final example again tends to favour an ad- ditive compilation, again without being conclusive. JOHST (1978) quan- tified the inhibitory effects of vocalizations and the visual presence of a conspecific on exploratory behaviour in the water vole, Arvicola ter- restris, using a combination of a stuffed dummy and loudspeakers in a runway set-up. The response measurements (proportion of tests in which the animal failed to traverse the runway as well as travel time) indicate a simple addition of the stimulus value of the two modalities in arriving at the value of the stimuli combined. d. How is the comparison between objects made and how is the out- come influenced by interfering variables? In JANDER'S (1968, 1971) model a comparator unit has the task of weighing the cumulative values of each of the objects. JANDER states that the data are consistent with substraction as the mathematical procedure carried out by this unit, but he adds that this should not imply that earlier processes in the entire chain might not have another mathematical nature. Therefore, his statement need notbe taken as in contradiction with our finding that the effectiveness of a dummy pair in breaking posi-</page><page sequence="388">GENERAL DISCUSSION tion preference depends on the ratio and not the difference of the max- imal projections of these dummies. An essential difference between JANDER'S model and ours is that in his conception interfering factors ('St6rquellen') are thought to act after the comparison is made. In our model the influence of at least the more im- portant and analyzable variables is thought to modulate the cumulative values of the objects to be compared, thus before the comparator acts. The most interesting interfering factor that we found to influence the decision is the tendency to escape. When this tendency was strong it was found to promote consistent minority choices and when it was weak con- sistent majority choices were prevalent. A tendency to escape of in- termediate strength seemed to promote the dominance of position preference (II.2.4.b., II.6.7.). We believe that this entire phenomenon can be explained with a model based on the assumptions that 1) each of the features of the dummies on the nest-rim not only stimulates the tendency to retrieve but also the tendency to escape, and 2) the results of both these effects and the evaluation of the sites are summated (or com- bined in any other mathematical way).

Explanation suggested for the causation of three types of choices, based on the simultaneous evaluation of each dummy on its effectiveness for stimulating incubation as well as escape responses, and on the site upon which it is placed. The figures are hypothetical. 375</page><page sequence="389">376 G. P. BAERENDS Fig. 72 illustrates this model by means of hypothetical figures. On the basis of heterogeneous summation the total effectiveness for the retrieval response is computed for a smaller dummy laying on site A and a bigger one on site B - and the reverse - under three different degrees of ac- tivation of the tendency to escape in the gull. The relative attractiveness for the retrieval response of the nest-rim sites A and B is represented by 4 and 3, respectively. The effectiveness of the smaller dummy is taken as 4, that of the bigger as twice as high. Moreover it is assumed that the bigger dummy has a three times higher scaring effect than the smaller one and that this effect is multiplied (BAERENDS, BROUWER &amp; WATERBOLK, 1955) with the internal level of escape when the gull is returning in its territory. In relation to the tendency to retrieve, this escape level is assumed to in- crease twice in the second and three times in the third calculation. The calculations demonstrate how in principal a relatively low escape tendency will lead to consistent majority choices, a moderate tendency to position preference because the positive and the negative effects of the dummies outweigh one another, and a high tendency to escape to consis- tent minority preference. Consequently, position preference is thought to occur when a decision on the features of the models has become impossi- ble. The principle of the model does not depend on the exact nature of the processes through which internal and external factors combine or in- teract, or through which heterogeneous summation takes place. As already said the present data do not allow speculation about the equa- tions involved. e. Models and the distinction between the releasing and the directing effects of stimuli. The problem of distinguishing between releasing and directing stimulus situations has been discussed in V.5. After our discussion on the models we should mention that DAWKINS &amp; IMPEKOVEN (1969) have claimed that in fact the Choice Threshold Model would describe a mechanism functioning for the direction of the choices, and thus determining the relative numbers of responses given to each of two simultaneously presented stimuli while not accounting for the rate of response. For the latter purpose these authors developed another model, the 'Go/No-go Decision-Maker'. It determines when on the basis of the Choice Threshold Model a decision is made. Since for each decision the state of the variable V with respect to the thresholds in this model must be sampl-</page><page sequence="390">GENERAL DISCUSSION 377 ed, the response rate must be a function of the frequency (K) with which this sampling takes place. The authors have tested this model on the pecking response of black-headed gull chicks at a dummy displaying simultaneously two differently coloured bills. Six different colours were used. The frequency K was found to be controlled by the best stimulus available during presentation of the pair. DAWKINS &amp; IMPEKOVEN have applied the Go/No-go Decision-Maker for predicting the relative sen- sitivity of the methods of simultaneous and successive presentation of ob- jects. If Psim and Psucc are the proportions of responses to the preferred stimulus in both types of presentation, it can be deduced that Psucc = 1/(3-2Psim). This means that Psim is larger than Psucc, and thus that simultaneous presentation is of both methods the more sensitive one. As mentioned in V.5., earlier FRANCK (1966) empirically arrived at this con- clusion. The data of the authors show that the frequency of sampling (K) is in- versely proportional to the strength of the stimulus. They explain this phenomenon by a LoRENzian hydraulic type of model, assuming that the tendency to sample builts up as long as no response is released, and is abruptly reduced thereafter. Strong stimuli would give less time for building up than weak ones, for which the variable V has to reach a higher threshold. For this reason the authors conclude that stimuli prefer- red for 'directing' tend to have a low value for 'releasing'. This stresses functional dichotomy between the two models which according to the authors would be reminiscent of the 'classical' ethological distinction be- tween orienting and releasing effects of stimuli. In our opinion the latter is not generally true. TINBERGEN (1942, 1948, 1951) has emphasized this distinction when he experimentally showed in a number of cases (begging response in thrushes, bee-hunt of the digger wasp Philanthus, sexual ap- proach of the butterfly Eumenis semele) that different elements of the stimulus situation subserved the releasing and the orienting function. In the pecking response as well as in the first part of the retrieval act release and direction cannot be experimentally separated. The fact that more pecks are directed to blue than to green in the experiments of DAWKINS &amp; IMPEKOVEN may be due to both a difference in effectiveness for directing and for releasing, as well as to each of them. In our opinion the Go/No-go model, as conceived by its inventors, determines the (internal) readiness to respond. The Choice Threshold Model determines, in dependence of this readiness (level of V), how selective the response will be. When V is high, selectivity is poor, but that does not mean that the response, when carried out, is poorly controlled.</page><page sequence="391">378 G. P. BAERENDS The task the Choice Threshold Model is thought to fulfil is not identical with the one 'classical ethology' has attributed to the taxis- or orientation component of the 'instinctive activity', thus the counterpart of the fixed action pattern ('Erbkoordination'). For functional reasons it would be difficult to believe that the phenomenon of threshold lowering or 'suprathreshold indecision', which is an essential element in the Choice Threshold Model, would be able to frequently interfere with the correctly oriented performance of an activity. In particular this is unlikely when a stimulus is guiding an animal for some period of time instead of for a single instant and then probably impinges on the animal continuously or repeatedly. It may be better conceivable for a short, introductory response, such as exploratory pecking, but this is exactly the kind of response for which, as said above, separation of a releasing and a directing effect is not practically feasible. Most likely, it is even theoretically wrong to distinguish between both components in an instantaneous short lasting response; there is actually no proof that such a response can be released without at the same time being directed. This would fit the fact that FRANCK (1966) and NYSTROM (1972) who compared results obtained with simultaneous and with successive presentation for pecking in gull chicks, did not find a difference between both methods in the order of preference for different colours. Probably, with each of the two methods they were studying the same mechanism.</page><page sequence="392">B. THE ROLE OF THE BEHAVIOURAL ORGANISATION, AND IN PARTICULAR OF A SYSTEM FOR ESCAPE, IN CONTROLLING ASPECTS OF INCUBATION BEHAVIOUR Animals classified in the same taxonomic group share the same basic organisation of their anatomy; their structure corresponds to the same 'Bauplan'. This is generally recognized by anatomists. Less commonly, however, do people realize that to be able to use this structure effectively the behaviour of an animal should similarly be built on a 'Bauplan', which must be in harmony with the structural one. In both cases there must be a genetic basis and for both holds that the 'Bauplan' is the substrate on which evolutionary changes can take place; viz. by modifying via the genes some items in the ontogeny of the 'Bauplan' under pressure of selective forces. For activities in which anatomical structures are used as instruments, such as the movements of legs and wings, of fingers or claws, or the jaws, the harmony between structure and behaviour was probably too 'natural' and 'self-evident' for questions about origin and causality to be asked (even as yet this has only rarely been done, BAERENDS, 1966, 1975). It took until the forties before such questions were raised and they did not concern activities with a direct implemental function but the conspicuous and often bizarre-looking communicative actitivies. Then the ethologists posing the problem how in the course of evolution such signal activities might have arisen and attained their special forms (KORTLANDT, 1940a, b; TINBERGEN, 1940, 1952) became aware that they must have originated as consequences from basic characteristics of the behavioural organisa- tion, the 'Bauplan' or 'Wirkungsgefiige' (voN HOLST &amp; VON SAINT PAUL, 1960). Composition of hierarchically structured motivational control systems, was proposed as a basic principle of this organisation (KORTLANDT, 1940a, 1955, 1959; BAERENDS, 1941, 1975; TINBERGEN, 1942, 1950, 1952; DAWKINS, 1976). Interaction of such systems provided a potential basis for the evolutionary derivation of signal activities. The precursors of these signals - activities which to the human observer appeared functionally irrelevant - were thought to have occurred as a result of conflicts between simultaneously stimulated systems. In this way a behavioural substrate would arise which through the action of selection pressures could be molded to serve a communication function (TIN- BERGEN, 1952; BAERENDS, 1975).</page><page sequence="393">380 G. P. BAERENDS When watching the course of the egg-retrieval tests dealt with above, the occasional occurrence of activities interrupting the incubation pro- cedure, apparently without serving a function, struck us. Our interest in their causation was aroused even more when we obtained the impression that such 'irrelevant' activities occurred more frequently in tests with minority than with majority choices. This was the main incentive for us to embark on the study on which Section II of Part I of this monograph is based. In that study an attempt has been made to develop a causal inter- pretation for the pattern of occurrence of some tens of different elemen- tary activities during incubation sessions of the herring gull. Data col- lected on the frequency of these actitivies over time, the temporal rela- tionships between them, their dependence on particular external stimulus situations, etc. were used for deducing a set of logical rules underlying the organisation of incubation behaviour in this gull species. In accordance with our starting-point it was crucial that not only the oc- currence of the behaviour patterns with obvious functions (such as for maintaining the proper temperature of the eggs or for restoring slight nest-disturbances) should be explained, but also the occasional ap- pearance of activities functionally interfering with brooding. We called these actitivies interruptive behaviour; attention was especially paid to the occurrence of short bouts of rising and re-settling, nest-building and preening. The network of factors found to control the behaviour during an in- cubation session was finally laid down in a flow diagram (Part I, Section II, C), which has been given again in Fig. 73 of the present volume. It is based on the principle of a hierarchical control open for feedback input. To explain the time pattern of occurrence of the different activities distinguished, control by at least two motivational systems had to be assumed, one subserving incubation (N) and one controlling a tendency to escape (E). Whereas strong activation of E will exclude incubation for the time being, a milder interference by E is conceived to lead to the oc- currence of interruptive behaviour, in particular of preening activities. Insufficient feedback information from the clutch is thought to reduce the activation state of N directly and, if continuing, also via stimulation of E. This leads first to re-settling and nest-building but may also induce preening, especially when the disturbance of the clutch is not removed in time. In Part I the arguments for postulating systems and sub-systems in the behavioural organisation were based on the analysis of efferent behaviour, thus on the regularities in the occurrence of motor patterns. Different</page><page sequence="394">GENERAL DISCUSSION 381 elementary action patterns were found to share groupwise common causal factors, besides having each a specific eliciting situation of their own. Such factors need not directly induce one or more activities, but only the potentiality to perform them when the appropriate specific stimulation is received. This potential or motivational state may last beyond the time the inducing common causal factor is active. In this Part II the concept that a hierarchical structure is underlying behaviour, and in particular that the proceedings during incubation shifts of the herring gull can be interpreted as the result of control by an incubation system (N) with which an escape system (E) may interfere to different degrees, could be confirmed and further elaborated. First, the relationships between the results of the various measurements made on the efferent behaviour during the experiments (see Fig. 6), such as the lengths of the latency periods, the number of eggs retrieved (1r vs 2r), the posture before retrieving (AS vs ST), and the ratio between interruptive building and preening could be satisfactorily explained with this model. In addition, however, it turned out that afferent aspects of the behaviour observed could also be understood along these lines. We have argued that activation of a system makes the animal receptive to specific information components, conceivably through sets of detectors converging via selec- tors on response eliciting mechanisms. We have further given evidence that an activated E-system tends to inhibit the effect of strong stimuli, i.e. to reduce the input from the detector sets in favour of input from memory. Thus, the interaction between the systems N and E determines the evaluation of the external stimulus situation and influences the deci- sion correspondingly. It can explain differences between tests in the first choice made from a particular set of dummies. The type of criteria used (strength of stimuli present versus resemblance to natural object) was found to depend on the balance between N and E. This could be con- clusively shown with respect to consistent majority and consistent minori- ty choices. The occurrence of position preference could also be explained with this model, but on this point our evidence is less conclusive. Our search for correlations of the type of choice made with various characteristics of the accompanying behaviour has shown that the in- fluence of E appears as a syndrome; several aspects of behaviour tend to be modified according to a replicable pattern. This argues for a centraliz- ed control and for the conception of a system for escape. However, all in- dications that the E-system is activated do not necessarily appear simultaneously in each single test. Their coincidence is a statistical phenomenon.

Part of them are external factors specific to the release or orientation of the element, others are internal and among these the influences of the N-system are of particular impor- tance. The fact that we did succeed in disclosing a set of rules in the oc- currence of all elements and aspects of behaviour during an incubation shift argues for the view that at any moment the behaviour of the bird is determined by the interacting internal factors supplied by at least the systems N and E and the external stimulation. In determining the proceedings on or near the nest the incubation system plays a leading role. Depending on the external situation a bird in which this system is activated performs appetitive behaviour (CRAIG, 1918; LORENZ, 1937a, b) which leads to the consummatory situation: be- ing seated on the nest and receiving the feedback stimulation required. This appetitive behaviour consists of several steps, some of which have to be carried out successively and some of which can be posed as alter- natives (see Fig. 73). The kind of steps taken and their order are likely to be determined by programmes in the bird by means of which the external situation is systematically checked and the ensuing behaviour correspon- dingly adjusted. For incubation these programmes have not been further investigated, but for another behaviour system of the herring gull, the system for body-care, VAN RHIJN (1977) has made an attempt to ex- emplify a way in which such a system might work. On the basis of a statistical analysis of the temporal relations between various bathing and preening activities he arrived at a hierarchical model underlying a pro- gramme with a main routine and several sub-routines. Information from state variables as well as from external sources is consistently processed by these programmes and leads to the manifestation of bathing and trim- ming behaviour controlled by system P, represented in the lower part of Fig. 73. Consequently variation in the external situation will account for a con- siderable amount of variation in the course of the appetitive phases. Moreover, differences between the appetitive behaviour of individuals are found. Those are likely to result from variation in the ontogeny of such programmes, which is likely to be chiefly due to differences in ex- perience (such as found for the predatory behaviour of individual cats; BAERENDS-VAN ROON &amp; BAERENDS, 1979), but for which the influence of genetical factors should not be excluded. The activated escape tendency interferes with the appetitive behaviour for incubation and with the performance of the consummatory act. This</page><page sequence="397">384 G. P. BAERENDS can happen in various ways. First, the influence of E is likely to affect the posture of the bird (stretching of the neck), the position of the feathers (sleeking), and the nature of its vocalizations. When the bird is on the nest the close contact between brood patches and the eggs will be dislodg- ed and - as set forth in Part I - resettling, nest-building and preening may occur as interruptive behaviour. When the bird has not yet reached the nest the influence of E is likely to slow down its approach and hence postpone landing when the bird is still in the air, and/or increase the length of the to-period after the bird has alighted on the territory. E may also influence the orientation of the bird, in particular with respect to frightening stimulus situations. When conspicuous dummies are lying on the nest-rim a frightened bird may walk away, or move in a wide circle around the nest, and when on the nest turn away from the dummies, even covering them with its tail. E also tends to lengthen the t1- and t2-periods on the nest and in this way influences the type of consistent choices; on the basis of stimulus strength or by comparison with memorized expectation. Thus E influences the effectiveness of external stimulation for releasing and directing activities and probably also for feedback control. In this way, but probably also through a general lower- ing of the tendency to retrieve, the escape tendency influences the number of dummies or eggs rolled into the nest-bowl. Further we found effects of the tendency to escape on the occurrence of position preference; on the one hand in case of a moderate to high activation of E, by reducing the effectiveness of a dummy with respect to retrieving - on the other hand in case of a low activation of E, by reducing the sensitivity of the bird to detailed features of the dummies. Finally, when at high intensity E overrules I, the bird will leave the gullery. A tendency to escape from or to avoid a particular situation can be aroused by external stimulation. This stimulation may be strictly localiz- ed and affect only one bird at the time, such as dummies on the nest-rim or disturbance of the nest structure. It may also be a predator moving over or through the gullery. In the latter case, however, the escape tendency in most birds is earlier aroused by the behaviour of other birds (alarm calls, alarm postures, attack flights) than by direct observation of the potential source of danger. The threshold for the external situation releasing escape responses - as judged by the tolerance birds showed towards changes applied by us in the nest situation - varied between in- dividual gulls. Experience importantly influenced the level of the escape threshold. Independently of experience with our procedures this level was in all birds lower in the beginning of the incubation season than later on;</page><page sequence="398">GENERAL DISCUSSION 385 it was also lower after dusk than during the day. This implicates the in- fluence of internal factors. Also, as discussed in II.6.4d, the data suggest the existence of sexual differences in the readiness to show escape responses. We may therefore conclude that external and internal factors both contribute to the aspects of the tendency to escape found in various responses. Whatever the factor activating the tendency to escape, it always in- creases the level of a state variable exerting an influence on the behaviour of the animal which persists for some time. This is demonstrated by the relationships found between the choice made, the length of latency- periods and the occurrence of interruptive behaviour during different periods of a test, as well as in similarities in the values of these data between successive tests. The important question arises along which route(s) the state variable acts on the various control mechanisms for efferent behaviour as well as on the afferent information processing mechanisms. One might conceive of a direct inhibiting influence on the incubation system and (through this channel) an indirect influence on lower levels of integration, but also of a direct action of E on such levels. These alternatives need not be mutually exclusive. To solve this problem experiments especially planned for this purpose are necessary. Our data can only give indications, and sugges- tions for further research. On the one hand several of our observations argue for an influence on control mechanisms of relatively low levels in the hierarchical organisation. This, for instance, applies to the many cases of birds taking position on the nest facing away from dummies of very unnatural appearance. It is also likely to apply to the decision between ST and AS and between ir and 2r as far as the influence of the features of the second dummy is concerned. In fact, the model given in Fig. 70 for explaining the occurrence of consistent majority-, consistent minority-, and position preference choices presumes an interaction of the tendencies to incubate and to escape at a relative low integrative level and so does our model on the organisation of the releasing and/or directing mechanism (Fig. 68). Differentiated frightening effects, such as seemed to have been caused with respect to green after the frightening experience with a low flying fighter plane (p. 220 and Fig. 55), also point to interac- tion at a low level. On the other hand a number of arguments for interac- tion at higher levels can be given. One of them is implied in the model developed in Part I, and again given in Fig. 73 for the occurrence of in- terruptive behaviour, in particular for the eruptions of preening activity at the nest. Another case is the general suppression of all incubation</page><page sequence="399">386 G. P. BAERENDS behaviour with a lasting or frequently repeated stimulation of escape. The fact that different indicators for activated escape tended to correlate in the same test might also be more parsimoniously explained by a direct influence of E on N; but then, to explain the frequent exceptions to such correlations, influences at lower levels have to be assumed in addition. The function of the escape system differs essentially from that of other systems. Whereas the latter all subserve some physiological need of the animal and, although they are sometimes in conflict, do not necessarily interact with each other, the escape system has the task of interfering with other behaviour patterns for the security of the individual. In order to achieve this with the smallest amount of interference with the functions of other systems, one would except the E-system to be able to act at different levels of these systems and in various ways. In this context a model is relevant which CARLSTEAD (1982) has developed for explaining differences between the responses of individual male cichlid fish of the genus Haplochromis toward intruders into their ter- ritory, while they were simultaneously exposed to other disturbances in their environment, such as switching on a bright light over the tank or by the experimenter showing her presence in the room. This model is based on the analysis of much quantitative data collected in a standardized ex- perimental situation. It proposes that the intruding fish specifically stimulates a motivational system for territorial defense, and the ex- perimenter a system for dealing with potentially dangerous stimulation. The former system controls the behaviour with respect to the intruder, the latter system selfprotection responses, such as hiding. Both systems compete for control of response mechanisms, thus of the behavioural final common path in MCFARLAND's (1974) sense. The quantitative relation between the levels of these two systems determines how long a bout of each type of response lasts. The data collected required in addition the postulation that both types of stimuli also stimulate a fear-system which is able to modify the output resulting from the interaction of the two other systems. This fear-system also exerts its influence on other behavioural systems of the animal. In addition to the three systems mentioned a fourth independent factor had to be taken into account, a general factor for reactivity to new kinds of environmental stimuli, which was found to influence the persistence of the reaction to both the intruder and the disturbances and which also accounts for part of the individual dif- ferences. Although the kind of measurements supporting and justifying this type of model in CARLSTEAD'S study are not available in our case, it is tempting to design a modified version that could suit the interpretation of</page><page sequence="400">GENERAL DISCUSSION 387 our observations on the gulls during the egg-retrieval experiments. This has been tried in Fig. 74. In this model the eggs and the nest are thought to be the components stimulating with the input So a system for incuba- tion behaviour (I), whereas the disarranged position of the eggs on the nest, and possibly the hide standing near to it or the alarm calls of birds elsewhere in the colony, are components stimulating with the input sd a system for coping with disturbances (D). Both components may stimulate a fear system (F), the level of which can also be influenced by factors which have acted earlier on the gull, external experiential as well as inter- nal physiological factors.

A simplified version of CARLSTEAD'S model for the functional organisation of the behaviour mechanism enabling an animal to accomplish a particular task while coping with disturbances, as adapted to our case of the egg-retrieval experiments. tween the systems I and D determines whether the response will be one persistently directed to the incubation object (po) or to dealing with the disturbances (Pd). Depending on the level of F, the responses resulting from po and Pd (Ro and Rd, respectively) can become mixed with com- patible fleeing components (fo or fd) and lead to the spectrum of action in- dicated. Positive and negative feedbacks from the actions may influence the inputs into I, D and F. System U is to account for the general factor influencing the reactivity of the animal, irrespective of the specific behaviour system concerned, to 'unexpected' or 'relatively novel' stimuli</page><page sequence="401">388 G. P. BAERENDS appearing in the animal's environment. CARLSTEAD found it necessary to postulate this system for explaining behaviour differences between in- dividuals and closely related species. The differences found in our ex- periments in the responsiveness of males and females to egg dummies could probably also be better interpreted on the basis of sex differences in a factor U than in the influence of a general fear system F. The relationships between all events interfering with a quick dispatch of the incubation procedures made us assume that they share causal fac- tors. The possibility of at least part of this complex of common causal fac- tors to remain active, even after external releasing or priming factors no longer applied, led to the postulation of a motivational system for escape. In my opinion this conclusion is unavoidable. The criticism fre- quently raised against the uncritical usage of drive concepts (e.g. HINDE, 1959, 1970) should, however, be taken to heart. Postulation of a system does not yet imply that its mechanism is understood. I believe to have made it clear that several internal and external factors are thought to in- fluence the level of the state variable of the system and also that this level cannot be measured by means of one indicator only. Further, there is no doubt that it is influenced by feedback resulting from the activity of the animal. Use of the system concept has no implication as to the physiological basis of the structure of a postulated system; I consider it more likely that the systems postulated have the character of a network than that they are localized in a restricted site. Other studies (HOGAN, 1965; BALDACCINI, 1973) have produced arguments to postulate more than one system for escape - one for moving away from the danger, the other for crouching and staying put - which might even interact with one another. Except for one observation our data give no basis for such an assumption with respect to the interference of escape with incubation behaviour. This exception is 'freezing' in response to moderate fright stimuli. A gull occasionally shows this while sitting on the eggs, the neck stretched with sleeked feathers and looking around. During periods of this behaviour the bird does not respond to stimuli from the clutch, the temperature of which drops, or from eggs on the nest rim; nor does it per- form interruptive behaviour. Freezing occurs in reaction to distant alarm and we have seen it when near the nest a dummy egg was slowly raised by a contrivance dug into the ground (see Part I, p. 200). We are inclined to interpret this freezing as a first response to a low intensity alarm in the colony, of which the source cannot (yet) be localized. It has been suggested that the type of behaviour ensuing from interac- tion between two mutually inhibitive motivational systems would depend</page><page sequence="402">GENERAL DISCUSSION 389 on the absolute levels of activation of their states as well as on the ratio between these levels (TINBERGEN, 1952; MOYNIHAN, 1955). Unfortunate- ly, however, so far a conclusive ethological method for determining the level of one state independently from that of other systems has not been developed. As we extensively discussed in 11.6.5. all behavioural in- dicators measured for the purpose of assessing the motivational state, are likely to be under the influence of the incubation (N) and the escape (E) systems, each indicator probably to a quantitatively different extent. By means of a complicated reasoning, which was very difficult to keep clear from circularity, we have tried to make assessments of the motivational balance for the various criteria used. Nevertheless this method remains unsatisfactory. The probably purest measurements of the tendency to in- cubate, little affected by E, are the number of eggs retrieved from the nest-rim and the reaction to an experimentally reduced clutch, provided the bird is used to experimental procedures and the test is taken over a brief period. The longer the measuring period the more habituation to the experimental situation begins to play a role and/or the greater the chance becomes that E is activated because of the prolonged contact with a deficient nest situation. When egg-retrieval is used as a measurement for N, one should moreover realize that the feedback from the clutch to ths system changes every time an egg is rolled in. Since it is in the nature of the escape system always to interfere with at least one other system, its absolute strength is most unlikely to be measurable with behavioural methods. The escape tendency can only be assessed relatively, with respect to its impact on other ongoing behaviour. However, in contrast to the incubation system it is possible to manipulate the escape system in the field. Fright stimuli of different strength can be given at different times and if this is repeated in a large number of tests, changes and fluctuations in N can be statistically eliminated. To test the theories developed here an experimental approach of this kind seems pro- mising. One may ask how the model for the organisation of the incubation behaviour could be tested. The most desirable method of testing is cer- tainly prediction. However, a probably prohibitive practical difficulty to achieve this for this in principle deterministic model is the vast amount of variables involved, partly internal and partly external to the gull, of which one would have to know the values at the moment the gull is to act. The values of some of them, such as occasional disturbances, should have to be predicted too. While working with the birds in the field we often at- tempted predictions about the behaviour a particular gull was going to</page><page sequence="403">390 G. P. BAERENDS show, and the more we believed to understand the underlying mechanism the more often our predictions turned out to be correct. As a matter of fact further developments of our experimental designs were usually based on such predictions. For proper predictions, however, a mathematical description would be needed for the various processes in- volved. Computer simulation would then come within reach and help to provide a basis for real predictions in the field situation. At this stage of the study the best test of the models is to check case by case to what extent the behaviour of the gull can be understood with the help of the model on the basis of the records of all behavioural measures taken during the test. This way of testing gave consistent results which, however, do not lend themselves for demonstration in a publication. We also made it a rule to seek for testable explanations every time apparent discrepancies turned up in the interpretation of a particular case. We finally consider it as a test that the principles of the model, primari- ly developed on the basis of the data on size, could later be confirmed from the data on the other principal categories, largely collected by dif- ferent observers. I find it difficult to believe that the principles of organisation, as found for the incubation behaviour of the herring gull, would not be present in other animals. I hope that the results obtained in this study will be check- ed, also for other species, and that in general this study will stimulate fur- ther penetrating research into the principles of behavioural organisation. The structure of this organisation determines the possibilities on which the programmes for the behaviour of different species as well as in- dividuals are based. I consider knowledge of the behavioural organisation of equal importance to knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nervous and endocrine systems for gaining more understanding of how behaviour is brought about. Summary In this second part of the monograph experiments have been described and discussed which were undertaken to investigate which visual characteristics of the herring gull's egg are effective, and to what extent, in evoking incubaton responses. Inspired by the LoRENzian concept 'releasing mechanism', the present study - involving 12 seasons of field work - has grown into an attempt to analyse for a particular case the processing of information received from the environment. Section I: The external morphology of the egg and its variability. Since the sensitivity of the bird for different features of the egg will be the subject of in- vestigation, this introductory section is devoted to the description of the variability of the external morphology of the egg, especially with respect to shape, size, groundcolour, and</page><page sequence="404">SUMMARY 391 speckling pattern. Emphasis has been laid on a comparison of the variability of various features between eggs of one female and between the eggs of a sample representative for the whole population. Of weight, volume, and linear dimensions (length and width) the variance within clut- ches was found to be significantly smaller than the variance in the entire sample. The same holds true for different parameters of shape. To compare the variation in speckling pattern the number of primary speckles (dark speckles in the outermost pigment layer) and their average size was used. Of both, the variance within the clutch was larger than within the population. The distribution of primary and secondary spots was highly cor- related. High correlations were also found to exist between the density of spots and their mean size on the pointed and on the blunt half of the egg. However, the absolute values of the two were lower for the former than for the latter. The colour of the speckles and of the background was determined with an Ostwald col- our scale. Of both the variance was found to be smaller in eggs of the same than of dif- ferent females. The last laid egg of a clutch (C-egg) tended to have the lowest volume of the three, to be the lightest in weight, the shortest and the least slender one. If one of the three eggs of a clutch is more brightly coloured it is likely to be a C-egg. Such eggs tend to have fewer spots and those present are often of large size. In general, however, no systematic size dif- ference was found in spot size between A-, B- and C-eggs of the same clutch, but their number was more often larger in A-eggs. Scribble- or smear-shaped speckles (instead of the normal rounded ones) occurred in 88% of all cases found, on C-eggs. An indication was obtained that clutches in grass-covered areas tended to have more often greenish groundcolours than clutches in sandy areas with buckthorn bushes and dispersed marram grass tufts. For the purpose of achieving some understanding of how the different morphological features of the egg are brought about, relevant data from the literature are reviewed. The opinion is upheld that the pigment is applied in the egg shell in layers and that the speck- ling results from porphyrin flocculi which after entering the uterus from the oviduct, suspended in a diluted solution of that pigment, precipitate on the egg shell. On the basis of the anatomical and physiological data the oddity of the C-egg can be explained. Sup- port could be found in the literature that a number of differences between features of the clutches of different gulls may be genetically determined. Section II: The effectiveness of different egg features for the egg-retrieval response. Chapter 1: Experimental procedures for evaluating stimulus effectiveness. As a criterion for determining the effectiveness of an egg feature the retrieval response was chosen. Features were varied on wooden dummies which were offered to the gulls on the nest-rim in pairs. During each choice test the behaviour of the gulls was watched from a hide and recorded on a time scale. In the experimental design provisions were taken against interference of conditioning to a site on the nest rim or to specific dummies, with the conclusions drawn from the results of the tests. Chapter 2: Size. To test the effectiveness of size, dummies varying from half to twice all linear dimensions were used. In a great majority of tests the gulls preferred larger over smaller dummies, also when the size of dummies exceeded those of natural eggs. Comparison of the two dummies by way of the ratio between their maximum projection (MP) can explain the results of all tests in which the larger dummies was consistently preferred by a bird, since position preference or site tenacity in the choice tests could always be overcome by in- creasing the MP-ratio. Sometimes a bird temporarily showed a consistent preference for the smaller dummy (consistent minority preference). The occurrence of these consistent</page><page sequence="405">392 SUMMARY minority choices is not due to idiosyncrasies of particular individuals; they may occur in any individual from time to time. The explanation of such temporary preferences and their theoretical importance are at the core of this study. The hypothesis was postulated that it depends on the motivation of the bird whether a consistent majority or minority choice is made. In chapter 2 and in chapter 6 it has been tried to further develop this hypothesis and to define the motivational states involved. Analysis of the time passing between the return of the bird after a test has been laid out and the first dummy retrieved, showed that in the population of tests in which the smaller dummy was consistently preferred the latencies tended to exceed those in the population of tests with first choices for the larger dummy. This suggests a greater in- fluence of the tendency to escape in tests with consistent minority choices. Analysis of the occurrence of different kinds of interruptive behaviour in both populations of tests ap- peared to confirm this conclusion. In consistent minority tests the likelihood of preening to occur alone or beside building and/or preening was greater than in consistent majority tests. In Part I of this monograph the occurrence of preening was found to result from in- terference of the tendency to escape with the incubation tendency. This result was tested in chapter 6 on independent populations of tests concerned with other kinds of features. Dummies in which length and width has been changed in different proportions, resulting in elongated or compressed shapes, were found to have slightly lower effec- tiveness for evoking responses than proper egg-shaped dummies. Chapter 3: Shape. Egg-shaped dummies were in the majority of tests found to be more effective than dum- mies of equal volume, shaped as cylinders, rectangular blocks or prisms. These abnormal- ly shaped dummies were more often effective with rounded than with sharp edges. Consis- tent minority choices occurred in this group. They mainly concerned preferences for a sharp edged dummy and were exhibited by birds very sensitive to size differences. The sharp edged dummies had a slightly higher maximum projection than the rounded ones. Attempts to make abnormally shaped dummies surpassing the normal shaped in effec- tiveness failed. Chapter 4: Colour. Green dummies were more effective than yellow, brown, blue, red and grey ones (all with black spots). Yellow scored second, brown third and red had the lowest score, although the effectiveness of blue, red and grey tones was of the same low order. The preference for green was a genuine colour preference, yellow and brown were also preferred over all grey tones used. The effectiveness of the different greys increased with its brightness but drop- ped again at white. Consistent minority preferences for the more natural brown over green occasionally occurred. Chapter 5: Speckling. Speckling as such was found to be effective. This effectiveness increased with an increase of the number of speckles. Smaller speckles were preferred over larger ones. Dark speck- ling on a lighter background was more effective the inverse combination. By means of a series of dummies in which spots in one of four shades of grey were com- bined with a background in another one of these shades, it was tried to test the relative value of the darkness of the spots, the brightness of the background and the contrast be- tween both. It was concluded that the contrast between speckles and background is of first importance, followed by the positive character of the speckling pattern and in the third place by a relatively light background.</page><page sequence="406">SUMMARY 393 In the evaluation of dummies in which different characteristics of the speckling pattern were combined in an unnatural way, the preferences sometimes varied between different gulls and in the same gull at different times. A dummy with a high density of small black spots, a green groundcolour, and 11/2 times larger than natural in all dimensions, proved to be more effective in inducing egg-retrieval than a real egg. Thus, the colour, the speckling pattern and the size of a dummy can be made 'supernormal'. Chapter 6: The influence of motivation on the decision made. In this chapter three different types of criteria have been used for investigating the motiva- tion of the bird when making its choice, viz.: a) the latency of occurrence of different phases in the tests; b) the mode of four binary classes, viz. 1) retrieval either preceded by settling or not, 2) either one or two dummies retrieved, 3) test started with either one or no egg in the nest, 4) 0 or 9; c) the incidence of interruptive behaviour during the test. Arguments are given in this chanter and in chapter 2 that all criteria mentioned here may serve as indications of the motivation during retrieval. The relationship between latency and the kind of decision made by the bird was clearest for the latency period t1 (AS), elapsing between arrival on the nest and rolling the first dummy in birds settling before beginning to retrieve. In the principal category shape the probability that the egg-shaped dummy is retrieved first increases with the length of this latency period. For speckling pattern the same holds true for normally speckled dummies compared with poorly speckled ones. In contrast, for the other experiments in the principal category speckling and for the principal categories colour and size it was found that the probability that the generally preferred dummy (i.e. the dummy with supernormal features) is first retrieved decreases with increasing length of the latency period. Thus, preferences for supernormal stimuli are promoted by short latencies and preferences for best resemblance by long ones. With regard to the binary classes, first choices for the type of dummy generally prefer- red in a category were more often correlated with one egg retrieved (1 r) and with an emp- ty nest at the start (On), both indications of a low tendency to retrieve. In addition, first and consistent choices for egg-shape, and for a natural speckling pattern over a poorly speckled one were more common in birds which settled before retrieving (AS); but first and consistent choices for supernormal dummies in particular occurred in birds which re- mained standing. First choices for the more natural dummy appeared to occur more often in females and first choices of supernormal dummies in males; however, the data on the relationship of sex with first retrieval were not consistent for all categories considered. The interpretation of the modes of the binary classes in terms of motivation is discuss- ed. It is complicated because each of the different modes is likely to result from interaction of the tendency to incubate and the tendency to flee in different absolute strengths as well as in different ratios. It is concluded that a relatively low tendency to incubate promotes consistent majority choices in favour of proper resemblance, when combined with a relative high tendency to escape, and in favour of supernormality when the escape tendency is low. The inverse combinations promote position preference. These interpretations were checked with the data on interruptive behaviour in the light of the explanation of the occurrence of this behaviour given in Part I. The percentage of tests with interruptive behaviour was found to be higher in AS- and in 9-tests than in ST- and ao-tests, indicating a stronger interference of the tendency to escape in the former ones. The tests with building ones. T quotie tests with building was higher for ST- than for AS-tests, for 0o- than tests with preening for Q-tests (size-category only), for tests in which two dummies were retrieved instead of only one and for tests started with one egg in the nest pit as compared with an empty nest, thus for all cases interpreted as dominated by the incubation tendency.</page><page sequence="407">394 SUMMARY Chapter 7: The processing of heterogeneous information on egg features inducing the retrieval response. In this chapter the ways are explored in which information about different features of the external situation is combined to produce a final response. The relative effectiveness of a number of dummies in which the features had been varied in different combinations was compared, using measured differences between positions on the nest-rim as a yardstick. The rule of heterogeneous summation was found to apply. Each feature was evaluated on its own qualities, independently of the presence or absence the other features tried. Summation of these partial values determined the final output. Egg features likely to have been learned were included in this process of heterogeneous summation. The same holds for the evaluation of different sites on the nest-rim; conse- quently position preference is thought to occur when the incubation-inducing effect of the features of a dummy and the fear-inducing ones are matching each other. Heterogeneous summation contributes to the possibility to create supernormal stimulus situations. Section III: The relative effectiveness of different egg-features in responses other than egg-retrieval. Chapter 1: Other incubation responses. In a limited number of experiments the original nest was replaced by two similar nest structures, each with a differently looking clutch of 3 equal dummies. The preferences for settling in this situation corresponded to those found for retrieval: egg shape was preferred over abnormal shapes, speckling over plain background colour, green over other colours, and larger over smaller egg-shaped dummies. Gulls are startled by a marked change of appearance of one or more eggs in their clutch. Repeated presentation of a visually unattractive stimulus had a negative influence on nest-attendance and promoted egg loss through robbery. Thus speckle-painted clutches suffered fewer losses than plain-painted ones. Speckle-painted clutches with brown groundcolour suffered least; other groundcolours following in the order: green and yellow- blue--red (as found in egg-retrieval). Reduction of the number of eggs in a clutch, especially for three eggs to one, and presence of abnormally shaped or sized dum- mies also influenced nest-attendance negatively. Chapter 2: Feeding response. The effectiveness of different egg-dummies in evoking feeding responses was studied by presenting a number of dummies belonging to the same category at equal distances on an open area frequently visited by gulls. Egg-shaped dummies evoked more feeding responses than abnormally shaped ones; among the latter the sharp-edged dummies were less attractive than the rounded ones. Normal size and sizes somewhat below normal were preferred over enlarged sizes. Brown, red and yellow dummies were found to have the highest and about equal effectiveness in evoking feeding responses, green the lowest, with blue in between. It is concluded that in a feeding motivation the gulls prefer natural shape, size and probably also colour. When confronted with different colours the order of preference was different from that found for incubation responses. Herring gulls which in the laboratory had been trained to find food in pairwise placed pots covered with removable unpainted cardboard lids, displayed spontaneous prefer- ences when the lid were replaced by differently painted ones. Brown and green lids were more often first chosen, red, blue and grey scored lower, with yellow in between. Since lighter greys were clearly preferred over darker ones it is probably that, apart from the response to brown, a genuine response to colour differences is not involved.</page><page sequence="408">SUMMARY 395 Section IV: The influence of experience with respect to incubation responses. Orientation on the nest and its surroundings. The herring gulls have a precise knowledge of the location of their nests, which must be based on visual beacon orientation. The presence of the nest-structure and, even more, of eggs is essential for settling, not for identification of the own nest. The topography of the nest surroundings is instrumental in causing certain orientations on the nest to be favoured over others. In egg-rolling tests the birds tend to retrieve first the dummy nearest to the position taken, unless the attractivity of the second dummy suf- ficiently exceeded the site preference. The influence of experience on stimulus selection in incubation responses. In the great majority of tests herring gulls did not discriminate between their own and alien eggs. However, in 3 cases - two retrieval and one nest-choice experiments - birds distinghuished between their own eggs and alien eggs of a clearly different groundcolour (brownish versus greenish). In addition 6 birds with cyanotic clutches appeared to have a preference for blue groundcolour over brown, but although their own eggs were unspeckl- ed they distinctly preferred speckled eggs and dummies. An incubation season on plain-painted eggs did not extinguish the preference of its owner for speckling. However, 5 of 10 birds which had been incubating red, blue, or yellow eggs for two weeks, showed a preference for that colour in choice tests with the in general highly evaluated green; 3 birds preferred green and 2 appeared indifferent to the colour. Attempts to teach a bird not to retrieve dummies with a particular feature were very successful for green and yellow, but much less so for red and blue. Further, gulls could be taught to retrieve a plain-painted dummy in favour of a speckled one; a relatively long latency period on the nest before retrieval seemed to facilitate this learning process. An at- tempt to teach a gull to retrieve a block-shaped dummy, presented together with a pegged egg-shaped one, failed. Section V: General Discussion. A. The mechanisms of stimulus selection. Chapter 1: To what extent is stimulus selection response-specific? The data obtained in this study on stimulus selection with respect to incubation and feeding responses in the herring gull are compared with data from the literature, on herring gulls, other larid species, and - less exhaustively - on birds of other groups. For all incubation responses of larid birds studied a preference for egg-shape and for a speckling pattern, as well as an aversion for red and a low value for blue seems to be general. A preference for supernormally sized eggs also seems to be general, but on the evaluation of green the data - even in the same species - are not consistent. It is likely that a preference for green is present in all species. However, a relatively high tendency to escape in the bird during the tests may often have masked this green preference and led to a preference for a colour matching that of the real egg (brown). For feeding responses, and also for approach, the reactivity of chicks of larid birds peaks in red and blue, practically the reverse of the responsiveness of incubation responses. Red also tends to evoke pecking responses in adults. Stimulus strength increases with the inten- sity at which a feature is represented. These selective sensitivities could be brought about under the assumption that different detector or analyzer units, with the following characteritics would be involved in the information processing: 1) high responsiveness to medium wavelength (yellow-green), 2) low responsiveness to medium wavelength and high to red and blue, 3) responsiveness gradually increasing from low for short to high for</page><page sequence="409">396 SUMMARY long wavelengths. Which type of responsiveness prevails at a particular instance is con- trolled by the motivation of the bird; since mostly this selective responsiveness is not specific for a single response but rather for systems or subsystems in the behavioural organization. Responsiveness to features of shape and of pattern also are often similar for homologous response groups in related species. This could likewise be explained through the intercala- tion of specific detectors. It is suggested that information about specific stimulus situations vital in the environ- ment of an animal could be made identifiable by means of a combination of inputs from a characteristic set of detectors. Chapter 2: On the adaptiveness and the nature of stimulus-selection in larid birds. The set of features characterizing an object when a particular motivational state is aroused in the bird is in the many cases studied only a rough adaption to the real characteristics of the adequate object. It is adapted in the sense that, provided a choice has to be made between red and green the former colour is more suitable for characterizing the food of the non-herbivorous gulls and the latter is the better match for eggs. Such a rough adaptation could well be conceived to result from a compromise between functional demands and physiological constraints. In many of the examples for which this statement holds the stimulus response relationship was originally postulated to be innately present. Taking this notion as a point of departure the hypothesis is developed that that informa- tion about aspects of natural situations present in an animal without prior experience with such aspects, could be laid down in the form of nervous pathways (primary S-R links) between detectors or analyzers on the afferent side and an efferent, co-ordinating, feeding the motor control of a response or group of responses (selector). It is suggested that these links develop through maturation processes controlled by genes and that consequently in this way information about the environment can in the course of evolution penetrate into the genetical code (LORENZ, 1961, 1965). Chapter 3: The influence of the primary S-R linkages in naive animals on learning. Arguments from experiments on learning are discussed which suggest that the primary S-R links are instrumental in building up learnt information about external stimulus situations relevant to the animal. Features relatively effective (strong) in evoking a response were also found to be relatively easily learned in the context of reactions to that response. Chapter 4: A model of the information processing mechanism. A model is proposed which should explain all findings in this study about the release or direction of egg-retrieval as well as those found in the literature and compiled in chapter 1 of this section with respect to the same or comparable responses. The model presumes that an animal without experience with the adequate situation to which it should react with a particular response, is able to identify this situation through a unique combination of nervous connections between sensory detectors and a selector unit which channels into a coordinating unit sending an output to the motor control of the response. Each of the participating primary S-R links fires into the selector unit when the stimulation received is above a certain threshold. The selector unit works according to the principles of heterogeneous summation. This opens the possibility for responsiveness to supernormal stimuli. However, the effect of the primary S-R links can be reduced by an inhibiting influence of an activated fleeing tendency on the selector. The likelihood of a preference for stimulus situations resembling the natural ones increases with the strength of this influence.</page><page sequence="410">SUMMARY 397 The combination of primary S-R links also guides learning processes through which more extensive and detailed knowledge about the external situation is acquired and stored in the memory. This information can be retrieved whenever a tendency to perform the response is activated, it then partakes in the process of heterogeneous summation in the integrator unit, together with the input from the selector and the impulse from the superimposed motivational system. Discrepancies between the external situation relevant for the response and the information about that situation stored in the memory, may ac- tivate the tendency to escape and throttle the effect of the primary S-R links. Although developed for describing the procedure leading to the proximate causation of a response, the model also has a bearing on understanding the ontogeny and phylogeny of this information processing mechanism. Chapter 5: A comparison of our model with the classical IRM-concept. Since the model is an attempt to develop and modernize LORENZ'S original IRM-concept, the backgrounds for that concept and the reasons for changes are discussed. They mainly concern the problems of 'innateness' of the specific sensitivity of the information process- ing mechanism, the nature and origin of the presumed sensitivity to configurational stimuli, the possibilities for mutual reinforcement and mutual interaction of'learnt' and 'unlearnt' information, and the question, whether the use of the term 'releasing' is cor- rect. It is further pointed out that an information processing mechanism working along the principle of heterogeneous summation is unfit for the comparison of feedback stimulation with a set value or template consisting of several components. For this purpose an at least partly differently structured functional mechanism should be conceived of. Moreover, whereas the former mechanism has been found to be susceptible to threshold lowering when the relevant internal tendency rises, this is unlikely to hold true for a mechanism comparing a situation with a template. Chapter 6: Supernormality. The origin of the concept of'supernormality' is traced. It is concluded that this phenome- non can be expected when stimulus selection for the release of a response is based upon the channeling through primary S-R links maturing during ontogeny without experience with the adequate stimulus situations. There are no reasons to assume that 'peak shift' through avoidance learning could be involved in the preference found for supernormal egg dum- mies. It is argued that sensitivity to supernormal stimulation may provide a selective force in evolution, e.g. in the development of camouflaged patterns on the egg. Chapter 7: On the nature of the decision making process. This chapter is dedicated to comparing our data and conclusions on the procedures by which the gull makes its choice between the two dummies presented, with those resulting from studies made with a similar purpose. First, DAWKINS' 'Choice Threshold Model' - assuming random choice when the inter- nal factor controlling the decision has passed a certain threshold - is considered as a possible alternative for our interpretation of minority choices as a result of the interference of incubation by a tendency to flee. Mathematical treatment of relevant data from our ex- periments did not distinguish between the two interpretations. Second, DAWKINS' 'Attention Threshold Model', in which the animal is supposed to use different criteria successively in a fixed order of preference, was tried against the rule of heterogeneous summation, assuming simultaneous weighing of all relevant information perceived. Several series of tests, in which different pairs of dummies were successively</page><page sequence="411">398 SUMMARY presented, could be found in our material for which DAWKINS' interpretation did not hold, but which were well in accord with the heterogeneous summation principle. Third, the mathematical nature of the process by which different kinds of stimulation are combined is discussed with reference to the literature. It is concluded that on the basis of the data presently available no conclusive answer can be given. Finally, a hypothetical model (Fig. 72) is given of how the occurrence of consistent ma- jority preferences, position preferences, and consistent minority preferences could be in- terpreted as the result of a stepwise increase of the interfering effect of the escape tenden- cy. B. The role of the behavioural organisation, and in particular of a system for escape, in controlling aspects of incubation behaviour. In this chapter the different kinds of data, concerning the nature of afferent as well as of efferent response mechanisms, as obtained in the experiments on the effectiveness of various egg features for the release and/or direction of incubation responses in this Part II of the monograph, are placed'into the general framework for the organisation of incuba- tion behaviour as developed in the earlier published (1970) Part I. At that time it was con- cluded that to explain the various kinds of behaviour which might occur during an incuba- tion session - in particular the interruptive activities resettling, nest-building and preen- ing - it was necessary to postulate that with the primarily activated incubation system another system, inducing the bird to leave the nest was potentially interfering. This con- clusion formed the basis of a deterministic model, again given in Fig. 73 of this Part. The present results corroborate this conclusion. With regard to the efferent behaviour mechanisms, the particular interrelationships between the latency periods distinguished in the tests and the modes of the so-called 'binary classes' (one or two dummies retrieved, standing or sitting before rolling, third egg present in or removed from the nest-bowl, o0 or 9 performing), and between the modes of these classes, could all be interpreted on the basis of interference of a tendency to escape with brooding, without the former system becoming overt. On the afferent side postulation of an escape system was needed for ex- plaining the occurrence of consistent preferences for supernormal stimulation with respect to colour, speckling and size, besides occasionally occurring preferences for dummies with naturalistic egg-appearance, or dominance of site preference over dummy preference in the tests. Arguments are given that the strength of the interfering tendency to escape is not only due to currently impinging external stimuli but also to internal factors which may persist after the external stimulation inducing them has disappeared. The ways in which escape might interfere with response controlled by the incubation system is discussed. Interference at relatively low levels (simple and complex responses) as well as at higher ones (systems of different order) is indicated. Addendum: correction of some statements made in preliminary reports on the present study. In the course of the long period involved in carrying out the experiments, analyzing the results, and writing the monograph, several preliminary reports have appeared, mostly on occasion of papers presented for meetings (BAERENDS, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1970, 1972, 1977, 1981; BAERENDS &amp; KRUIJT, 1973; KRUIJT, 1958). In these papers some statements occur which in the light of our present view or the en- tire data material and on the results of our analyses, should not be maintained. In an at- tempt to reduce their chances on further survival in the literature we wish to mention them here briefly.</page><page sequence="412">ADDENDUM 399 1. It has been repeatedly stated (BAERENDS, 1. . ) that the various modes involved in in- ducing incubation responses towards eggs would differ in their degree of effectiveness with respect to these responses. This opinion was mainly based on the fact that we found sen- sitivity for features of shape considerably more difficult to demonstrate than sensitivity for features of colour, speckling or size. Differences among the latter three categories are less obvious, and when present can more parsimoniously be attributed to differences in inten- sity of the stimuli applied, which are usually not measurable between different modes of codification. When the birds are receptive to stimulation representing the primary codes (as was generally the case in gulls accustomed to our experimental procedure) these stimuli surpass in effectiveness those representing codes acquired through experience with the own eggs. This is why shape generally appeared as a less important feature than colour, speckling or size. However, under the influence of a tendency to flee the effect of features of shape (and of natural size and colouration) might incidentally exceed the ef- fects of enlarged size and of the generally highly valued conspicuous colours or speckling patterns. 2. On the basis of our impressions while testing gulls on the effectiveness of the character size it was contended that males would discriminate better between different dummies than females (BAERENDS, 1959, p. 362 top). This statement is incorrect. 'Better' was not the appropriate word to use. It was intended to mean 'more in accor- dance with the majority preference in experiments on size', and this meant 'less often based on appreciation of natural egg features'. Our analysis of the entire material (II.6.4.d.) shows that males more often responded positively to supernormal stimuli and females more often to naturalistic ones. Thus females discriminated better in tests for shape. It was shown that in general first choices based on dummy preference occurred more frequently when the retrieval tendency was relatively low. This could be due to a relatively low tendency to incubate or/and interference by a tendency to flee. The former factor probably more often influenced the choice of males and the latter more often that of females; females seemed more wary for disturbances of the situation on the nest. 3. Clear cases of random choice are strikingly rare in our entire material, in contrast to what we originally thought (BAERENDS, 1954) (see V.7.). 4. The opinion that nest-building would be organized in a behaviour system independent of and equivalent to the system for incubation (BAERENDS, 1959) was abandoned on the basis of the analysis given in Part I, Section II.A.; evidence present in the tests discussed in Part II confirms this conclusion. The relative increase of building as interruptive behaviour during the tests in the course of the season, mentioned as an argument against this view in par. 7 on p. 362 in BAERENDS (1959), mainly concerned reaction to deficient feedback stimulation from the clutch (incompleteness, unnatural shape or size of the egg- dummies). The sensitivity for such deviations from expectancy increased with the level of the incubation system, and was consequently higher at the peak then at the start of the season and also in general higher in females than in males. The deviation is thought to cause a temporary drop of the level of the incubation system to a value corresponding with nest-building, which also precedes brooding early in the season.

Zusammenfassung In diesem zweiten Teil der Monographie wird fur verschiedene Merkmale des Silber- m6weneies - besonders solche der Form, des Fleckenmusters und der Gr6sse - die Fra- ge gestellt, in wieweit sie zum Auslosen und Richten der Bruthandlungen beitragen und wie die von den Sinnesorganen empfangenen Information im Tier verarbeitet wird. Die Arbeit wurde durch den von LORENZ postulierten Begriff des auslosenden Schemas ange- rect. In Sektion I wird die aussere Morphologie des Eies und dessen Variabilitat hinsicht- lich der genannten Merkmale beschrieben. Die Varianz der Form, Lange, Breite, des Ge- wichts und der Grundfarbe der Eier, wie auch der Anzahl und mittleren Gr6sse der Flecken, war innerhalb der Gelege kleiner als in einer representative Probe aus der ganzen Kolonie. Das Fleckenmuster des jungsten Eies eines Geleges war 6fters von dem der zwei alteren Eier etwas verschieden. Manchmal waren die Flecken wie gekritzelt, manchmal auch zeigte das zuletzt gelegte Ei verhaltnissmassig wenige grosse und runde Flecken. Eine Hypothese fiber die Weise, in der die Farbe und Zeichnung der Eischale zustande kommen, wird an Hand von Literaturangaben abgeleitet. In Sektion II wird zuerst (II. 1.) die Versuchstechnik besprochen. Die Versuche wurden in Freiland gemacht. Holzattrappen, wovon die Merkmale beliebig variiert werden konn- ten, wurden der M6we paarweise zur Wahl auf dem Nestrand angeboten. Dabei wurde vorausgesetzt dass das am ersten eingerollte Ei den h6chsten Reizwert hat. Der ganze Versuchsablauf wurde von einem Versteck aus beobachtet und das Verhalten wurde in Einzelheiten der Zeitfolge nach protokolliert. Die Versuchsergebnisse fur die Merkmalkategorie Gr6sse (11.2.) zeigen dass in der Mehrzal der Einzelversuche die gr6ssere Attrappe der kleineren vorgezogen wird, auch wenn sie die Gr6sse des echten Eies weitaus iberschreitet. Nebst Vorzug fur eine der At- trappen spielt auch Vorzug fur einen bestimmten Platz des Nestrandes eine Rolle. Die dadurch verursachte Seitenstetigkeit konnte jedoch immer durchbrochen werden, inden man den Gr6ssenunterschied zwischen den Attrappen vergr6sserte. Die Vogel schienen</page><page sequence="425">412 ZUSAMMENFASSUNG die relative Grbsse der zwei Attrappen an Hand des Verhaltnisses ihrer maximalen Pro- jektionen zu beurteilen. Seitenstetigkeit ist nicht die einzige Ursache von Erstwahlen fur die kleineren Attrap- pen. Konsequente Wahlen fur das kleinere Objekt k6nne bei alien Mowen von Zeit zu Zeit vorkommen. Ob konsequent die grossere Attrappe zuerst eingerollt wird (Mehr- heitswahl), oder die kleinere (Minderheitswahl), oder auch Seitenstetigkeit dominiert, hangt von inneren Faktoren (Motivation, Stimmung) ab. Um die Art dieser Stimmungsunterschiede herauszufinden wurde die Verteilung der Latenzzeiten, sowie die des Vorkommens von 'unterbrechendem Verhalten' (Sichsetzen, Bauen und Putzen) bei den unterschiedlichen Wahltypen verglichen. Die Erbegnisse wei- sen darauf hin dass Minderheitswahlen auftreten, wenn eine Neigung das Nest zu verlas- sen (Flucht) sich der Brutstimmung uberlagert. Die spezifische Eiform wurden allen anderen angebotenen Formen vorgezogen (11.3.). Von den abnormen Formen (Wirfel, Zylinder, Prismen) waren solche mit abgerundeten Kanten effektiver als scharfkantige. Der Wert der verwendeten Farben und Graustufen senkte sich in der Reihenfolge: griin-gelb-braun-blau-rot-hellgrau-dunkelgrau (11.4.). Das bevorzugte Grun wich von der naturlichen Eifarbe stark ab; es handelte sich hier um einen wirklichen Farbvorzug. Flecken als solche erh6hen den Reizwert der Attrappe und zwar umso starkerje zahlrei- cher, dunkler und kleiner sie sind (11.5.). Ihr Wert erhoht sich je mehr die Flecken sich von der Grundfarbe des Eies abheben; ein 'positives' Muster ist einem 'negativen' (helle Flecken auf dunklem Hintergrund) uberlegen. Uebertreibung erhohte meistens den Wert des Fleckenmusters. Minderheitswahlen, d.h. in diesem Falle konsequente Erstwahlen fur Attrappen wovon die Flecken in keiner Hinsicht ubertrieben waren, kamen gelegentlich vor. Ueberdies un- terschieden sich Individuen manchmal in ihren Vorzugen, was ohne Zweifel mit der gr6s- seren Anzahl verschiedener Attrappentypen in dieser Kategorie zusammenhangt. Wenn eine Attrappe, die in allen Dimensionen 1'/2 Mal grosser war als das normale Ei, und uberdies grin bemalt, mit einer grossen Dichte von schwarzen Flecken, einem echten Ei gegeniber angeboten wurde, rollten die Mowen es in weitaus den meisten Tests als Erstes ein. Es war also wirklich 'supernormal' (iiberoptimal). In 11.6. wird der gesammte Data-bestand in verschiedener Weise analysiert um die Verursachung von Mehr- und Minderheitswahlen, sowie von Seitenstetigkeit aufzukla- ren. Drei Kriterien wurden dazu benutzt. Erstens verglich man die Latenzzeiten in unter- schiedlichen Phasen des Tests fur die verschiedenen Typen von Wahlen. Zweitens be- trachtete man den Wert von jeder von vier sogenannten binaren Klassen, namlich 1) ob das erste Ei gerollt wurden bevor oder nachdem die Mowe sich setzte, 2) ob eine oder bei- de Attrappen eingerollt wurden(n), 3) ob sich am Anfang ein oder zwei Eier in der Nest- mulde befand(en), 4) ob es sich im Test um ein c0 oder ein 9 handelte. Drittens wurde das Vorkommen von 'unterbrechendem' Verhalten wahrend der Testsperiode vergli- chen. Von den untersuchten Latenzzeiten lieferte die, welche zwischen Betreten des Nestes und Eirollen verlief falls sich die Mowe zuerst setzte, sog. t1 (AS), die deutlichsten Ergeb- nisse. Mehrheitswahlen fur Farbe, ibertriebene Gr6sse und auffalliges Fleckenmuster sind am haufigsten wenn die Latenzzeit kurz ist, der Vogel sich also schnell entschliesst. Je langer er zogert umso gr6sser wird die Chance dass eine Attrappe gewahlt wird die dem natiirlichen Ei ahnlicher ist (Minderheitswahl). Bevorzugung von Eiform ist niedrig bei kurzen Latenzzeiten und steigt erst bei wachsenden Latenzzeiten an (Abb. 25-30). Die Mehrheitswahlen waren in allen Merkmalskategorien (Form, Gr6sse, Farbe und Fleckenmuster) mit dem Einrollen von nur eine Attrappe ( r) korreliert und mit Tests wo- bei man am Anfang das dritte Ei aus der Nestmulde hatte wegnehmen miissen (On) um die Einrollbereitschaft zu erh6hen. Daraus wurde geschlossen dass eine verhaltnissmissig niedrige Bereitschaft zum Eirollen (Brutdrang) die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhoht, dass die in den meisten Tests bevorzugte Attrappe als erste eingerollt wird.</page><page sequence="426">ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 413 Erstwahlen fur die richtige Eiform und ein natiirliches Fleckenmuster waren haufiger wenn sich die M6we vor dem Rollen setzte (AS). Dagegen traten Mehrheitswahlen fur Grin, supernormale Gr6sse und ubertriebenes Fleckenmuster am meisten auf wenn der Vogel vor dem Rollen stehenblieb (ST). Vorzug der dem natiirlichen Ei ahnlichen Attrap- pen schien verhaltnissmassig mehr bei Weibchen, Vorzug der supernormalen Attrappe mehr bei Mannchen vorzukommen. Aus verschiedenen Griinden wird angenommen dass AS und 9 Indizien fur den Einfluss einer Fluchtneigung sind. Eine massige Brutneigung wirde also zu Mehrheitswahlen fur iiberoptimale Merkmale fiuhren wenn der Fluchtdrang relativ niedrig ist, und zu Erstwahlen fur Eiform und son- stigen natiirlichen Merkmalen bei einer h6heren Fluchtneigung. Diese Deutung ist in Uebereinstimmung mit der Tatsache dass das Vorkommen von r, On, AS und 9 im Test mit einem niedrigeren Wert des Quotienten Tests mit Nestbau Tests mit Nestbu einhergeht als das Auftreten von 2r, In, ST und cf. In Teil I dieser Tests mit Putzen ' Monographie (BAERENDS &amp; DRENT, 1970) wurde abgeleitet weshalb der Wert dieses Qu- otienten als ein Massstab fur die Bilanz zwischen den Neigungen zum Briiten und zum Fliehen betrachtet werden kann. 11.7. handelt iiber die Verarbeitung der von den unterschiedlichen Merkmalen emp- fangenen Information. Dazu wurden die Merkmale in verschiedener Weise auf Attrap- pen kombiniert. Der relative Reizwert dieser Attrappen wurde gemessen indem man die, mit Eimodellen verschiedener Gr6sse geeichten, quantitativen Unterschiede zwischen be- stimmten Stellen am Nestrand als Massstab benutzte. Das Reizsummenphenomen traf zu fur die gesamten untersuchten Merkmale, d.h. einschliesslich der Merkmale die Ahn- lichkeit mit dem natiirlichen Ei in sich schliessen, und welche wahrscheinlich Erfahrungs- bedingt sind. Dank des Reizsummenphenomens ist es m6glich, Attrappen herzustellen die einem echten Ei an Reizwert uiberlegen sind. In Sektion III wird der Reizwert von verschiedenen Eimerkmalen fur andere Handlun- gen und Funktionskreise untersucht. Fur die Handlungen des Sichsetzens wurden ahnli- che Ergebnisse erzielt als fur das Einrollen. Wenn dagegen Eier zum Fressen gesucht und geraubt wurden, hatte Grun den niedrigsten Reizwert, wahrend Braun und Rot bevor- zugt wurden. In diesem Falle wurden iibertrieben grosse Attrappen niedriger gewertet als Eier normaler Gr6sse oder auch kleinere. Die richtige Eiform erschien wichtiger fur die Auslosung von Fress- als von Bruthandlungen. Der Einfluss von Erfahrung auf die Anwendung von Bruthandlungen wird in Sektion IV besprochen. Fur das Zuriickfinden des Nestes, aber auch fur die bevorzugte Orientie- rung auf dem Nest und deshalb fur die Seitenstetigkeit, ist Erfahrung ein sehr wichtiger Kausalfaktor. Im Allgemeinen zeigten die Silberm6wen nicht die Fihigkeit zwischen eigenen und fremden Eiem zu unterscheiden; in 3 Fallen konnte jedoch gezeigt werden dass M6wen einer solchen Unterscheidung (nach Grundfarbe) doch faihig waren. Wochenlang Briten auf ungefleckten Attrappen vermochte aber nicht den starken Reizwert von Fleckenmu- stern auszuwischen, obwohl die V6gel zeigten, die benutzte Grundfarbe der Attrappe richtig gelernt zu haben. Versuche, die M6wen zu lehren, eine bestimmte Attrappe am Nestrand zu vermeiden, indem diese veranktert wurde, gelangen viel besser wenn ein fur Eirollen hochwertiger Reiz benutzt wurde (z.B. Grin) als eine fur Bruthandlungen unwichtiger (z.B. Rot). In der allgemeinen Diskussion (Sektion V) werden zuerst ahnliche Versuche an andern Vogeln, besonders aus der Gruppe der Laridae besprochen (V.1.). Sie geben den Ein- druck dass in bezug auf die Bruthandlungen aller untersuchten Mowen- und Seeschwal- benarten relativ hohe Reizwerte fur Eiform und Fleckenmuster und niedrige fur Rot und Blau gelten. Ein Vorzug fur Gruin wurde nicht bei anderen Arten aufgefunden, vielleicht weil unter den betreffenden Versuchsbedingungen eine Fluchttendenz den Reizwert von Grun zugunsten des dem echten Ei mehr ahnlichen Brauns maskierte.</page><page sequence="427">414 ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Alle untersuchten M6wenkiicken nahern sich vorzugsweise Rot und Blau und betteln besonders Schnabelattrappen an, welche diese Farbe zeigen. In Altv6geln lost Rot aggres- sives Picken aus. Der Reizwert scheint in alien Fallen mit der Intensitat des Reizes zuzu- nehmen. Alle diese iiber den Reizwert von Farben zur Verfiigung stehenden Daten k6nnte man erklaren mit der Annahme dass sie durch Detektoren oder Analysatoren im Mechanismus des Farbensehens vermittelt werden, welche eine der nachfolgenden Charackteristiken aufweisen wiirden: 1) hohe Empfindlichkeit fur mittlere Wellenlange (Gelb; Grin); 2) hohe Empfindlichkeit ffir Rot und Blau und niedrige ffir mittlere Wellen; und 3) eine von den kurzen nach den langen Wellen allmahlich ansteigenden Empfindlichkeit. Welche Empfindlichkeit in einem gewissen Augenblick eingeschaltet ist muss dann davon abhin- gen, welches Verhaltenssystem aktiviert worden ist. Dadurch konnen in verschiedenen Funktionskreisen verschiedene Analysatoren oder andere Kombinationen derselben be- nutzt werden. Der spezifische Reizwert fur bestimmte Formeigenschaften und Muster konnte in ahnlicher Weise auf Grund von Einschaltung von speziellen Detektoren erklart werden. Es wird vorgeschlagen dass jede fur das Tier primer wichtige Reizsituation in seiner Umgebung von einer bestimmten Kombination von Detektoren grob charakterisiert wer- den konnte. Das fiir eine Handlung, oder fur eine zum selben Funktionskreis gehirige Gruppe von Handlungen adequate Objekt ist von der stimmungsspezifischen Reizempfindlichkeit nur in sehr grossen Ziigen charakterisiert (V.2.). Die hohe Empfindlichkeit fur Rot in Zu- sammenhang mit Futter und fur Grin wenn Eier manipuliert werden miissen, kann man nur als eine Adaption betrachten wenn es bei der Selektion nur eine sehr beschrankte Wahl gabe; nur in dem Sinne dass fur ein nicht herbivores Tier Grin die zur Auslosung von Futteraufnahmereaktionen am wenigstens geeignete Farbe ist. Die Grobheit der An- passungen lassen vermuten dass dieses Kompromiss durch sehr starke physiologische Be- schrinkungen beeinflusst worden ist. Die Beziehungen zwischen Reiz und Reaktion, um welche es sich hier handelt, kommen wahrscheinlich nicht durch Erfahrung mit dem ade- quaten Objekt zustande; sie miissen von ausschliesslich genetisch gesteuerten Reifungs- prozessen hervorgebracht werden. Die gefundenen Tatsachen liessen sich verstehen wenn solche Prozesse eine Einheit zur Speicherung der motorische Kontrolle bestimmter Handlungen mit einer kleinen Anzahl von durch die evolutionare Auslese selektierten reizspezifischen Detektoren oder Analysatoren vom afferenten System verbinden wiirde. Solche Gruppen von unter Einfluss genetischer Kodierung primerr' entstandenen Reiz- Reaktion Verbindungen wiirden dann der 'angeborenen' Kenntnis zugrunde liegen, wel- che ein Tier von manchen Umgebungssituationen besitzen kann (LORENZ, 1961, 1965). Diese Kenntnis wurde ein Geleit zur Erweiterung durch Erfahrung sein (11.3.). In V.4. ist versucht worden, ffir die Auslisung und Richtung einer Handlung ein Schaltbild zu entwerfen, auf dessen Grunde sich alle erwihnten Befunde und Angaben er- klaren lassen (Fig. 68). Nach diesem Schaltbild werden, wenn ein bestimmter Selektor vom ubergeordneten Verhaltenssystem aktiviert worden ist, die Meldungen die von den zugehirigen Detektoren ausgehen gesammelt und dem Reizsummenphenomen gemass quantitativ zu einem Ausgangswert kombiniert. Dieser wird selbst wieder mit vom Ge- dachtnis gelieferten Meldungen und mit dem vom iibergeordneten Verhaltenssystem bei- getragenen inneren Impuls zu einem Ausgangskommando fiir die Motorik summiert. Die Starke der vom Selektor gelieferten Ausgangsmeldung iubertrifft jene der von Ge- dachtnis herruhrenden Information. Sie kann aber von einer Ausgangsmeldung des Fluchtsystems gedrosselt werden. Je grosser diese Hemmung, umso mehr neigt das Tier zum Bevorzugen von ausseren Reizen welche den natiirlichen iihnlich sind. Wird der Ausgangsmeldung des Selektors wenig gehemmt, so ist die Lage fiir eine Reaktion auf uberoptimale Reize giinstig.</page><page sequence="428">ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 415 Das in dieser Arbeit entwlckelte Modell weicht von dem von LORENZ anfinglich postu- lierten AAM hauptsachlich ab indem es versucht die Verarbeitung von Information, wel- chevom Individuum durch Erfahrung mit der adequaten Reizsituationen erhalten ist, und Information welche es unabhingig von solcher Erfahrung bestitzt, im selben Mecha- nismus stattfinden zu lassen (V.5.). Letztere, sog. angeborene, Information wird dadurch nicht der erlernten Information gegeniibergestellt, sondern sie wird, besonders bei langer lebenden Tierarten, als ein Wegbereiter zur Erhaltung relevanter Erfahrung betrachtet. Es wird fur wahrscheinlich gehalten, dass bei Vertebraten der Erfahrungsunabhingige Teil im allgemeinen nur allein wirksam ist, wenn das Tier ungehemmt und schnell auf eine Reizsituation anspricht. Auf Grund des Modells wiirde man eine Reaktion auf supernormale Reize erwarten wenn aus irgendwelchen Griinden der Einfluss von im Gedachtnis gespeicherter Informa- tion gering ist (V.6.). Die Empfindlichkeit fur Supernormalitat k6nnte in der Evolution als Selektionskraft wirken. Es wird dargelegt dass ein Mechanismus wie hier postuliert, wegen des zugrunde liegen- den Reizsummenprinzips und der Empfindlichkeit fur Schwellenwerterniedrigung bei hohen Werten des inneren Faktors, nicht dafiir geeignet ist Riickmeldungen zu verarbei- ten die mit einer komplexen Sollwertsituation verglichen werden miissen. In V.7. werden unser gesamten Daten und Schlussfolgerungen bezfiglich das Ver- fahrens das die M6we bei der Wahl zwischen zwei angebotenen Attrappen anwenden konnte, mit solchen von ihnlichen Forschungen verglichen. Zuerst wurde das sog. 'Choice Threshold Model' von DAWKINS - wobei das Auftreten von Zufallswahlen unterstellt wird, sobald ein innerer Triebfaktor eine bestimmte Schwelle iibers.chritten hat - unserer Deutung von Minderheitswahlen als Folge einer mit dem Brutsystem interferierenden Fluchttendenz gegeniibergestellt. Mathematische Bearbeitung der Daten ermoglichte es nicht, sich fur eine der beiden Interpretationen zu entschliessen. Zweitens wurde versucht, mit den 'Attention Threshold Model' von DAWKINS die Wahlen zu erklaren, die in aufeinanderfolgenden Tests von einem Individuum gemacht wurden, wenn jedesmal ein anderes Attrappenpaar angeboten wurde. Alle erzielten Se- rien konnten mit dem Reizsummenphenomen erklart werden, fur viele reichte das 'At- tention Threshold Model' eindeutig nicht aus. Drittens wurde, auch an Hand der Literatur, diskutiert ob die zur Verfigung stehen- den Daten genaue Aussage iiber die mathematischen Operationen geben, die an der Kombination von verschiedenen Reizen zu einer Ausgangsmeldung beteiligt sind. Diese Frage wurde verneinend beantwortet. Schliesslich wurde ein hypothetisches Modell (Fig. 72) gegeben, womit es sich verste- hen liesse, wie das Auftreten von konsequenten Mehrheitswahlen, Seitenstetigkeit und konsequenten Minderheitswahlen einem stufenweisen Ansteigen der Fluchtneigung zu- geschrieben werden konnte. In Kapitel V.B. werden die in den obenbeschriebenen Versuchen uber die Reizwerte von verschiedenen Ei-Merkmalen zur Auslosung und Richtung von Bruthandlungen er- zielten Ergebnisse in den Rahmen des im ersten Teil dieser Monographie (1970) ent- wickelten Wirkungsgefiges des Brutverhaltens eingepasst. Damals wurde die Schlussfol- gerung gezogen, dass es zum Verstandnis des Auftretens unterschiedlicher Verhaltensele- mente - insbesondere des Sichsetzens, des Nestbaus und des Putzens - notwendig sei anzunehmen, dass eine Neigung das Nest zu verlassen mit dem primer aktivierten Brut- trieb in Interferenz trate. Diese Idee ist in der Form eines deterministischen Schaltbilds (Fig. 73) dargelegt worden. Die jetzt angetragenen Ergebnisse bestatigen diese Schlussfol- gerung. Bezuglich der efferenten Verhaltensmechanismen k6nnen die besonderen Ver- haltnisse zwischen den in den Tests unterschiedenen Latenzzeiten und den Werten der sog. 'binaren Klassen' (ein oder zwei Attrappen eingerollt, erste Wahl vor oder nach der Entscheidung, drittes Ei in der Nestmulde oder daraus entfernt, O0 oder 9 handelnd), so-</page><page sequence="429">416 ZUSAMMENFASSUNG wieie e gegenseitigen Verhaltnissen zwischen den Werten dieser Klassen auf Grund einer Interferenz zwischen den Neigungen zum Briiten und zum Fliehen verstanden werden, ohne dass Verhaltensweisen des letztgenannten Systems 6ffentlich zu Tage treten. Be- treffs der afferenten Mechanismen war die Annahme des Einflusses vom Fluchtsystem er- forderlich, um das Auftreten von konsequentem Vorzug fur iiberoptimale Reize in bezug auf Farbe, Fleckenmuster und Gr6sse nebst dem Vorkommen von die Wahl dominieren- der Seitenstetigkeit und das gelegentliche Bevorzugen von den echten Eiern mehr ahnli- chen Attrappen im selben Tier deuten zu k6nnen. Die Meinung, die Starke der Fluchtneigung hing nicht nur von der augenblicklichen Anwesendheit von ausseren Fluchtreizen ab, sondern auch von inneren Faktoren, die, wenn sie von solchen Reizen ausgelost worden sind, auch nach Erlischung jener weiter andauern konnen, wird begrundet. Es wird diskutiert wie Fluchtsysteme mit den einem Brutsystem angeh6rigen Verhal- tensweisen interferieren konnten. Wahrscheinlich findet Interferenz in verschiedenen In- tegrationsebenen statt, sowohl an jenen der einfachen Verhaltenselemente wie an Syste- men verschiedener Ordnung.</page><page sequence="430">PLATES</page><page sequence="431">BEHAVIOUR 82 (1982) PLATE I ~~~~"li' _ .
