<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeffrey M. Wallmann EVOLUTIONARY MACHINERY: FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION IN BERNARD SHAW'S DRAMAS Bernard Shaw comes close to the fantastic incidents that abound in Utopian and dystopian science fiction, particularly in his dramas around World War I, in which setting and characterization become openly symbolic and even allegorical. In more general terms, that Shavian malcontentedness, that deep dissatisfaction with self and society, to- gether with the adventure in it, has assisted in making science fiction a field rich in irritants, rich in dangerous enemies, rich in speculative concepts. As such, he has been an influence on a generation of maga- zines and fanzines, television and films, and on the passing of science fiction into a new generation of malcontents. It is in this breakup of things, of things that surely need breaking up, that Shaw's views are especially pertinent in terms of science fiction. After all, technology is fundamental to modern science fiction. Technol- ogy frequently provides the raison d'Ãªtre as well as background of a story, as in the "hard" science fiction descended from adventure yarns by Jules Verne or H. G. Wells, involving fantastic machines like atomic submarines, spaceships, and time-travel contraptions. In other stories, like the "soft" science fiction descended from gothic tales by Poe or Mary Shelley, technology is often not a literal great machine, but a figurative or metaphorical device subordinated to social commentary - such as in</page><page sequence="2">82 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN the portrayal and criticism of mechanistic clockwork worlds. In a third sense, technology is extrapolated by science fiction to explore the in- creasing mechanization of life itself, with computers that think, androids that feel, and cyborgs in which flesh and machine are intimately and inextricably combined. Such science-fictional ways of viewing how man and machine are intertwined were adumbrated by Shaw's vision of the relationships between human nature and the shape of society, now and in the future. He intended to "prove" hypotheses that, like Utopian and dystopian writing, demand that we think critically about the fate of mankind if left to the devices of contemporaneous machines in all their guises. Over his lengthy career, his speculative theories evolved (and in his latter years, perhaps devolved), but his overall concepts, however valid, foreshadowed science fiction themes about machines in terms of socioeconomic power, political ideology, and scientific and technological progress. For example, Shaw assaulted the machinery of the British establish- ment by giving narrative shape to the Marxist condemnation of capital- ism. In his first play, Widowers' Houses, a young couple's marriage is depicted as an acquiescence to conform to an exploitive social system, and the endings of two other early plays, Arms and the Man and Candida, resolve problems arising in relationships from external economic and social corruption. Not only did Shaw oppose Victorian codes of conduct and duty, he also disparaged Victorian mechanism and technology, censuring science for not having "lived up to the hopes we formed of it in the 1860's."1 In Arms and the Man, for example, Shaw argues that war is a crippling (and capitalist) system of technology coupled with false honor. As Captain Bluntschli asks rhetorically, "Is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or a man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire?"2 It is a theme to which Shaw often turns, as again more than two decades later in Back to Methuselah: "The statesmen of Europe were incapable of governing Europe. What they needed was a couple of hundred years training and experience: what they had actu- ally had was a few years at the bar or in a counting-house or on the grouse moors and golf courses. And now we are waiting, with monster cannons trained on every city and seaport, and huge aeroplanes ready to spring into the air and drop bombs every one of which will obliterate a whole street, and poison gases that will strike a multitude dead with a breath, until one of you gentlemen rises in his helplessness to tell us, who are as helpless as himself, that we are at war again."3 Shaw's dramas, then, can be perceived as post-technological manifesta- tions of post-technological despair - a position that took science fiction another forty years to reach. Granted, a number of largely mediocre</page><page sequence="3">SHAW'S FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 83 post- and even pre-World War I dystopian books were published, and during the 1920s and 1930s a few classic dystopian novels like Zamiatin's We (1924) and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) appeared, but virtually all were marketed as mainstream and bought as mainstream, and were in line with the existentialist themes prevalent in much of mainstream fiction then. However, modern science fiction was taking quite the opposite tack. Pioneered by Hugo Gernsback, publisher of the first real science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, the attitude of science fiction was basically positivist and technocrat, with writers churning out action-adventuristic "space operas" and readers dreaming of unusual futuristic things like moon rockets and flying cities. And some science fiction explored, albeit superficially, relationships between technological developments and story characters who (ab)used them. Such plots often involved improving assorted social problems, and Utopian worlds were cast as organized on rational lines, free of supersti- tion and religious dogma. Aside from appealing to socialists like Shaw, the notion of scientifically planned social orders paralleled the visions behind the major political innovations of the time, including Leninism, Fascism, National Socialism, and even the New Deal. Moreover, industrial machines were beginning to replace people in the work force, a trend toward robotics that would accelerate along with Rosie the Riveter during World War II and that many laborers feared as threatening their livelihoods. During the 1940s there were many stories in which machines or robots are positive and sympathetic characters - Lester Del Ray's "Helen O'Loy," for example, or the robotic and the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. Yet this also was the era in which dystopian science fiction began to emerge, with writers forecasting alternative sociopolitical struc- tures whose failures were somehow linked to their uses of science and technology. James Blish's Cities in Flight series, for instance, portrays the rise and fall of the entire galaxy as an inevitable cycle in which machine technology is merely a symptom, not the disease; and in Nat Schachner's Space Lawyer (1953, but based on his 1940s Astounding stories) the total loss of cheap energy causes an old tycoon to declare that men who did not have to work any more would "lose all incentive, get bored, stop thinking and striving, and degenerate into pigs. Young man, within a hundred years they'd be slinking through cities they wouldn't know the use of, and staring helplessly at machines they don't know how to handle." There were plenty of other stories about robots running amok or computers taking over the world, but because there was a war on and man has always excelled at creating technology for killing, the themes of mass destruction were exceptionally popular - and depressing. In C. L. Moore's dark serial "Judgement Night" (Astounding, August &amp; Septem-</page><page sequence="4">84 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN ber 1943), a galactic empire as vast as Asimov's self-destructs in civil war. At story's end, an alien envoy condemns humanity: "You and your people have gone too far already along the road all humans go. Every nation digs its own grave, and we are weary of mankind." Right after the war, a spate of atomic doom stories were published, such as Chandler Davis's "The Nightmare" (Astounding, April &amp; May 1946), Theodore Sturgeon's "Thunder and Roses" (Astounding, November 1947), and Judith Merrill's first story, "That Only a Mother" (Astounding, June 1948). At the same time, horrific alternatives to nuclear destruction were posed by other hell-on-earth stories. Sinister and tragic results of Scien- tific Enlightenment cause the return of the Dark Ages in Robert Aberna- thy's "Hostage of Tomorrow" (Planet Stories, Spring 1949). In "Brother's Day Out" by William P. Roessner (Galaxy, July 1977), a culture declines into barbarism while monks diligently transcribe what knowledge still exists. Perhaps the most ambitious and provocative story along these lines is Walter M. Miller's classic A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959), which deals with an eternally recurring cycle of growth and destruction, in this case technology-based growth that strikes the scientific materialism of Gernsback and Wells a punishing blow. So, by the 1960s, there were two streams in modern science fiction: Utopian (the machines will work) and dystopian (no, they won't), and Shaw's plays mostly foreshadow the latter, which since the 1950s has been the more significant of the two. Moreover, another Shavian vision was developing in science fiction: dystopian stories that were less anti- scientific than they were anti-scientistic, criticizing the replacement of an humanist ethos with a technological ethos extolling instrumentalism. For example, in Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano (1954), technology is the immediate problem but human nature is the underlying trouble, with people too inadequate to operate the machines that administer the society. Similarly, in A. E. Van Vogt's "Co-operate - Or Else!" (Astounding, April 1942), an alien "ezwal" says, "Human beings have created what they call civilization, which is actually merely a material barrier between themselves and their environment, so vast and unwieldy that keeping it going occupies the entire existence of the race." How similar that sounds to Back to Methuselah: "Your task was beyond human capacity. What with our huge armaments, our terrible engines of destruction, our systems of coercion manned by an irresistible police, you were called on to control powers so gigantic that one shudders at the thought of their being entrusted even to an infinitely experienced and benevolent God, much less to mortal men whose whole life does not last a hundred years" (16:69). An oft-used parallel theme was - and still is - the perversion of science and technology, no matter what their Utopian potential, by being put at</page><page sequence="5">SHAW'S FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 85 the service of existing mechanisms of control. A good example is Philip K. Dick's novel The Man Who Japed (1956), in which technological advances are justified for Utopian reasons, but are employed to enforce a rigid moral code, resulting in massive institutional intrusion on privacy and freedom by a puritanical society devoid of Utopian spirit. This echoes Shaw's argument in The Sanity of Art that laws are moral hin- drances preventing us from thinking or acting on our own. The elite in Major Barbara keep power through violence: "the ballot paper that really governs us is the paper that has a bullet wrapped in it."4 In Misalliance, civilization is corrupted by "the constant attempts made by the wills of individuals and classes to thwart the wills and enslave the powers of other individuals and classes."5 To varying degrees, then, running through these plays and others - e.g., the destruction portrayed in Heartbreak House, hell in Man and Superman, and love in Candida - is the protoscientific theme of the new technical man detached from conscience and consideration, in contrast to the pre-technological era before the turn of the century. In this respect, Shaw foreshadows dystopian writers like Kuttner, Van Vogt, and Leiber, with their visions of technology gone rampant and wild, and another bunch including Sheckley, Pohl, Tenn, Damon Knight, and Sturgeon, whose more humanistic visions stemmed from the intuition that conventional technology myths would not work at all. Shaw's assessment of mankind grew increasingly somber and dysto- pian with the advent of World War I, and perhaps his most pivotal drama of this period is Man and Superman with its elements of what had been and what was to come. In the play's "Revolutionist's Handbook" preface, for instance, Shaw, writing as "Tanner," makes clear that he no longer believes that "Man as he exists is capable of net progress. . . . Whilst Man remains what he is, there can be no progress beyond the point already attained and fallen headlong from at every attempt at civilization; and since even that point is but a pinnacle to which a few people cling in giddy terror above an abyss of squalor, mere progress should no longer charm us."6 Neither does Shaw/Tanner continue to hold that Fabian Socialism or even revolution, violent or nonviolent, can improve the human condition, declaring that "we are to recognize that both . . . Fabian methods . . . and those of the dynamitard and the assassin . . . are fundamentally futile" (3:711). Rather, "The only fundamental and possible Socialism is the socialization of the selective breeding of Man; in other terms, of human evolution. . . . Our only hope, then, is in evolution. We must replace the man by the superman" (3:724, 723). To Shaw, evolution was not due to Darwinian "accident," but to the Butler-Lamarckian "striving of the individual" in adapting to the</page><page sequence="6">86 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN environment, success being passed on through the inheritance of "un- conscious memory" or habit - all part of a grand design working itself out consciously in the evolution of life. This Shaw called the Life Force, and the striving is what differentiates Heaven from Hell in the Dream scene. Hell is a hedonist's mirage, where the Devil presides over such illusions as romanticism, heroism, religious ecstasy, and sexual passions. To those like Tanner who seek reality, however, an eternity of pleasure is indeed a hell of boredom, so "Don Juan is going to Heaven . . . because it is for those who will work and strive, who will face and become the masters of reality."7 Actually, Don Juan is driven to go, compelled by the Life Force to struggle to produce a Superman: "I tell you that as long as I can conceive something better than myself I cannot be easy unless I am striving to bring it into existence or clearing the way for it" (3:461). Later in the scene, in an exchange that anticipates Shaw's more satiric and cynical dramas of the following decade, Don Juan tells the Devil, "To be in hell is to drift; to be in heaven is to steer" (3:646). The Life Force itself requires a pilot, having been blundering along the evolutionary path by a process of trial and error. The needed pilot is the man of genius who has been "selected by Nature to carry on the work of building up an intellectual consciousness of her own instinctive purpose" (3:498). Man, in other words, is the brains of the operation. Guided by man's intelligence and willpower, the Life Force will "replace [man] by a more highly evolved animal," an altogether different creature who will live above and beyond man's socioeconomic machinery with "its quackeries, political, scientific, educational, religious, or artistic" (3:721, 723). The Shavian vision that the sole salvation of homo sapiens is to create homo superior began flooding science fiction during the 1930s. That willpower is the key to pursuing Creative Evolution, in fact, not only cropped up in the November 1934 Astounding story "Twilight" and the 16 October 1935 story "Night" (both by John Campbell writing as "Don A. Stuart"), but also was spelled out in a 1971 interview with Campbell, who by then had become the famous editor of Astounding and Unknown. When the interviewer asked, "What keeps human societies going?" Campbell replied, "Competition . . . the ethics of evolution is 'try.' " Asked whether he thought the future was bright, Campbell agreed, his optimism reinforced by "three billion years of experience." He then asked the interviewer "how long has the life-force in you been going on?" The interviewer figured twenty-three years, his age. "No," Camp- bell said. "Three billion years."8 This Butler-Lamarckian concept of evolution manifested itself in some peculiar derivations. Shaw prophesied in Back to Methuselah that future children could have "a lot of extra heads and arms and legs"</page><page sequence="7">SHAW'S FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 87 (16:219), and in Man and Superman that the Life Force would create "a special brain - a philosopher's brain" (3:646) - although it should be noted that the science fiction clichÃ© of atrophied bodies and hypertro- phied brains, spawning spindly-limbed gnomes with humongous heads, is more the offspring of H. G. Wells from his War of the Worlds. Rather, typical of yarns employing the Butler-Lamarckian evolution is an early yarn by David Keller, "The Revolt of the Pedestrians" (Amazing, February 1928), in which over-reliance on automobiles is predicted to cause legs to atrophy, to which technology will respond with individualized "autocars." Other mutation stories predicate that the mutation is a genetic improvement which, as Shaw fervently desires in Man and Superman, "replace(s) man by the superman" (3:723). In the majority of these stories the mutation takes the form of telepathy, which, in accord with Shavian dystopian irony, almost always backfires on the mutants. Robert Wells's "Mindhunt" (Galaxy, April 1972) tells of a duel between two genius telepaths whose powers effectively cancel each other out, resulting in one of them dying in a spaceship crash and the other unable to get the victim out of his mind. In the earlier "The Piper's Son" by Henry Kuttner (writing as "Lewis Padgett" in Astounding, February 1945), the community of mind-reading mutants, called "Baldies" by nontelepathic humans, in traditional Shavian fashion can not make up its collective mind: should they wear wigs and join the majority as best they can, or should they go bareheaded and proclaim themselves a biologically superior species? A proponent of the latter declares near the end, "We are the Future! The Baldies! God made us to rule lesser men!" Clearly, quite a bit of modern science fiction echoes Shaw's message that without the human race evolving from its present status to something different, mankind will never reach the stars unaided. Another form of transformation becomes evident in two plays that followed Man and Superman, Major Barbara and Pygmalion. According to the Shavian theory of Life Force, that different creature called the superman can never be attained as a by-product of other considerations, but must be deliberately willed into existence, and unfortunately man- kind appeared to be in no hurry to evolve itself into extinction. Until and unless humans en masse reject the pleasantries of hell and strive for the asceticism of heaven, individual humans of goodwill must cope with their plight of mere mortaldom, unable to attain heaven and unwilling to settle for an earthly hell where man "produces by chemical and machinery all the slaughter of plague, pestilence, and famine . . . There is nothing in man's industrial machinery but his greed and sloth" (so saith the Devil in Man and Superman, 3:619). The Devil could well have been referring to Undershaft, the ethically bankrupt munitions manufacturer in Major Barbara. "I moralized and</page><page sequence="8">88 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN starved until one day I swore that I would be a full-fed man at all costs - that nothing should stop me except a bullet, neither reason nor morals nor the lives of other men" (6:339). Similarly, Pygmalion's Henry Higgins is disguised as a gentleman behind a facade of class position and education, a false prophet promising Eliza salvation while delivering entrapment. As Silver points out, "One of the chief forms of evil in modern times, Shaw intimates, appears in the guise of a would-be benefactor. . . . [T]he manners and distinctions of that social world Eliza wants to enter, constitute even with their imperfections whatever civilization is available, and Higgins in his savagery is its enemy."9 Eliza, although tempted, ultimately refuses to succumb. "Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to be just as good as you, I could kick myself. . . . I'm not afraid of you and can do without you."10 Nor does Barbara capitulate to Undershaft and accept his philosophy. On the other hand, neither young woman can return to her previous way of life as if nothing had changed. "You know I cant go back to the gutter," Eliza admits to Higgins (p. 422). And in the finale of Major Barbara, Barbara not only asserts her independence from Undershaft, but from her prior existence as a naÃ¯ve member of the often hypocritical Salvation Army. "Turning our backs on Bodger and Undershaft is turning our backs on life," she tells Cusins, who says, "I thought you were determined to turn your back on the wicked side of life." To which Barbara replies, "There is no wicked side; life is all one" (6:348). Therein lie their transformations. Eliza and Barbara are neither the saints they initially believe themselves to be nor the devil's disciples that Higgins and Undershaft want them to become. Choosing one or the other side of this black- white dichotomy is simply inadequate for dealing with the world as it is. Rather, both young women learn through their experiences that, as Cusins says, "you cannot have power for good without having power for evil too" (6:346), and that as humans they must come to terms with being both - a combination of soul and flesh, of spirit and materialism, which somehow must be balanced and inte- grated into one personage. This issue has become increasing important in science fiction, al- though because science fiction emphasizes technology, the theme is handled less through stories of biological evolution than through stories of creative - or demonic - fusion of engineering with medicine. The term most associated with this field is "cyborg," referring to those fitted with internal homeostatic mechanisms like pacemakers or artificial joints. An early cyborg story is Lester Del Ray's "Reincarnate" (Astound- ing, April 1940), in which an injured man transplanted into a robot</page><page sequence="9">SHAW'S FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 89 body uses magnets for muscles, gyroscopes for balance, and television lenses for vision. Frequently the creation of cybernetic organisms is used metaphorically for modern alienation and dehumanization. In C. L. Moore's "No Woman Born" (Astounding, December 1944), a "dead" actress and dancer continues her career with her brain encased in a graceful robot body, only to find at the end that she is speaking with "the distant taint of metal already in her voice." The machine elements that allow her to live also separate her from the humans among whom she wishes to live. Another story that makes the same point in a more optimistic way is Anne McCaffrey's novelette "The Ship Who Sang" (Galaxy, October 1966). Helva - another crippled Cinderella - prefers to be wired into a spaceship as its "brain" to work with human partners called "brawns," explaining, "As this ship, I have more physical power, more physical freedom, than you will ever know." More numerous, however, are dystopian cyborg stories. Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968, made into the film Bladerunner 1982) involves a cop's hunt for androids or replicants - machines virtually indistinguish- able from humans. John Varley's story "The Phantom of Kansas" (Gal- axy, February 1976) tells of a woman who is murdered over and over, but who keeps coming back over and over because her personality is on storage in a memory cube. In discussing the dilemmas and consterna- tions involved in trying to reconcile the dichotomies of human and inhuman, surely such cyborg stories are the deep, distant descendants of Shaw's foreshadowing dramas. Do Androids and "Phantom" also project forward, for they describe what effects on personality and society may happen from the technology of identity - e.g., sex change, cloning, transfer of memory, state proce- dure, even new kinds of illicit love. It is this exploration into the cultural problems and variations resulting from technology that has spurred the recent subgenre labelled "cyberpunk," which emphasizes technology's impact on gratifying human desire and parallels the Shavian desire to evolve a higher human capacity. Cyberpunk characters not only can replace mutilated limbs and diseased pancreas, but also can jack into custom cyberspace decks where they project their disembodied con- sciousnesses into landscapes akin to virtual reality. Their world, like our own, rests on an all-encompassing but hidden electronic world of connections and data that can be investigated and exploited by those with the ability to enter it. Indeed, William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and other writers of cyberpunk fashion gritty societies where all that computer jockey stuff of the underworld becomes the overground, not dissimilar to Shaw's hell in Man and Superman. In their stories there is no utopia, either in reality or in cyberspace. Still, cyberpunk authors also are following Shaw by adding notes of evolution-</page><page sequence="10">90 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN ary optimism to their novels: the possibility that humans might create or assist in the creation of new beings who can achieve what human beings cannot achieve. As Don Juan declares in Man and Superman, the law of his life "is the working within me of Life's incessant aspiration to higher organization, wider, deeper, intenser self-consciousness, and clearer self- understanding" (3:637). Clearly, then, certain themes in Shavian works like Man and Superman, Major Barbara, and Pygmalion can be seen to adumbrate key characteris- tics that are found in a wide range of cyborg science fiction stories: the simultaneous desire to offer entertainment and explanation in the context of the narrative; a tenuous synthesis of Utopian and dystopian viewpoints, indicating that one can kind of live in and outside of the technology; and a concluding attitude that may be pessimistic concern- ing the future of humanity but optimistic concerning the future of intelligent life. This double message - of despair for humanity; hope for a succes- sor - recurs as a strong undercurrent in Heartbreak House and emerges again with scarcely contained pessimism in Back to Methuselah. Written during World War I, Heartbreak House reflects Shaw's anger at the chaos and violence brought on by the war, as well as his alarm at the perceived disintegration of British society. The aimless drifting alluded to earlier in Man and Superman takes on deeper significance in the final scene, when Shotover chastizes Mazzini for believing in "the theory of an overruling Providence," snapping, "Every drunken skipper trusts to Providence. But one of the ways of Providence with drunken skippers is to run them on the rocks."11 A few lines later, just prior to the arrival of the bombs, Hector asks "what may my business as an Englishman be, pray?" To which Shotover retorts, "Navigation. Learn it and live; or leave it and be damned" (p. 574). There is more than a little irony in Shotover's advice, for although he is piloting his ship of Heartbreak House for the evolutionary advanced "seventh degree of concentration," his fondness for rum is veering "the drunken skipper's ship on the rocks, [with] the splintering of her rotten timbers, the tearing of her rusty places, the drowning of the crew like rats in a trap" (p. 573). Clearly, in his anger and alarm, Shaw is raising a clarion call for the enlightened elite to stop insulating themselves from the tragic realities of the public world, and to take back by force if necessary the reins of power and authority. His message in Major Barbara and Pygmalion that humans might transform, might adapt, is now supplanted by an anxious demand to reform and be damned quick about it. Time had run out for "a society drifting as opposed to one which has learned the virtue of setting a deliberate course by fixed stars. To navigate is to plan. Laissez- faire, though always delightful for a few, in a crisis is disastrous for all.</page><page sequence="11">SHAW'S FORESHADO WINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 91 There is no alternative to a planned society, that is the burden of the Shaw debate."12 Navigation proves downright impossible in Back to Methuselah, for in a context of fiercely negative and destructive feeling, Shaw has come to conclude that the art of navigation is beyond man's ability to master. The human race is not merely ignorant; it is congenitally too stupid to save itself. Still, if destruction is the result of a failure of human intelligence, and if human intelligence needs time to develop and mature, then the Shavian solution is to increase the span of human life. Increasing the life-span occurs through Creative Evolution, of course, the result of artificial as well as natural selection of man's unending progressive adaptation to the conditions of existence. "We're going to scatter the West through the stars," Senator Wagoner predicts in Blish's They Shall Have Stars (1957), "scatter it with immortal people carrying immortal ideas!" Extending life-spans to the point of immortality is a very old theme dating back to Taoist, Zoroastrian, and Mesopotamian myths, among others: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality" (I Cor. 15:53). The Shavian distinction lies in what he envisions that this longevity ultimately will produce. Until this point, Shaw's inexorable Life Force was directed toward creating supermen who were biologically superior humans or at least partial humans in nature, but in Back to Methuselah, his Life Force leads neither to human procreation nor to supermen who have any human character- istics. After all, if mankind will not help the Life Force to fulfill its purpose, then it will destroy mankind and invent a more appreciative species through the saving power, if this be salvation, of intelligence - mind conquering matter. "The day will come when there will be no people, only thought," the She-Ancient states, and the He-Ancient responds, "And that will be life eternal" (16:253). Shaw could no longer conceive of his superman evolving from human idealism through human science. Instead the path as well as the goal was pure intelligence, lacking human frailties or sensibilities. As Ed- mund Wilson notes, "The superior beings of Back to Methuselah are people who live forever; but . . . [w]hen they achieved it, what the Life Force had in store for them is the mastery of abstruse branches of knowledge and the extra-uterine development of embryos. Beyond this, there is still to be attained the liberation of the spirit from the flesh, existence as a 'whirlpool in pure force.' "13 An earth laid waste by wars; humanity extinct, no longer the recipient of such Shavian balms as Creative Evolution, Fabian Socialism, or feminine wisdom and vitality. The play confronts bleakness and savagery and the shattering of illu- sions with creatures of unemotional objectivity who grind facts into data,</page><page sequence="12">92 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN who operate little differently from machines with artificial intelligence. Live bodies "are only machines after all, it must be possible to construct them mechanically" (p. 228). Indeed it is, resulting in a Male Figure and Female Figure who are "mere automaton[s] . . . merely responding to a stimulus" (16:237). Man is machine. "A cold and pagan grandeur; but there is Mr. Shaw's philosophy."14 It is in science fiction, as in Back to Methuselah, a condition often to be desired. In Damon Knight's bitter "Masks" (Playboy, 1968), the psyche of the totally amputated protagonist is placed in what he calls "a tailor's dummy." Protesting, he demands to be installed in a cleanly functioning, all-metal body, and he soon comes to regard all other forms of organisms as repellent. Even more Shavian is Arthur C. Clarke's "Meeting with Medusa" (Playboy, 1972), in which a cyborg who must wear a total prosthesis gradually loses his humanness and comes to believe that he is a transitional being between man and the machine that will inevitably rule the universe. The unemotionally logical functioning of machines has been a prime source of mayhem in science fiction as well. Generally, machines are faced by human characters in one of three ways. First, by surprise. In Tom Godwin's "The Cold Equations" (Astounding, August 1954), a naÃ¯ve stowaway aboard a rocketship must to her shock face the fact that she has to be jettisoned, to die in space, because her extra weight would consume too much fuel for the ship to reach port. A dying man lies in a cave on the moon in Walter Miller's "I Made You" (Astounding, March 1954), trapped by a mobile autocyber fire-control unit whose damaged receptors prevent it from telling friend from foe. The man had pro- grammed the unit, which explains why, just before the unit blows him apart, he whimpers, "I made you, don't you understand? I'm human, I made you. . . ." His shock is not different from Pygmalion's in Back to Methuselah, who is startled when his Female Figure unexpectedly "picks up a stone and is about to throw it." In the resultant tussle, she bites his hand. He staggers back, crying out. "A general shriek of horror echoes his exclamation. He turns deadly pale . . . [then] falls dead" (16:238-39). The second reaction is dread. The He- Ancient in Back to Methuselah warns of man as machine: "When you have achieved this as Pygmalion did; when the marble masterpiece is dethroned by the automaton and the homo by the homunculus; when the body and the brain, the reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting, as Ecrasia says, stand before you unmasked as mere machinery, and your impulses are shewn to be nothing but reflexes, you are filled with horror and loathing" (16:248). In science fiction, Asimov's robots are restrained by his famed Three Laws of Robotics from harming humans, but many more stories present anthropomorphic machinery designed without restrictions or geared</page><page sequence="13">SHAW'S FORESHADOWINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION 93 purposely for violence. Particularly if the machines are strangers, hu- mans are bound to be leery of trusting their programming and capabili- ties. Gort, the giant robot in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), is so powerful that "there's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the earth." Undoubtedly the most scarifying machines are Fred Saberha- gen's Berserkers, which are "an armada of robot spaceships and sup- porting devices [whose] fundamental programming was the destruction of all life, wherever and whenever they could find it" ("Inhuman Error," The Ultimate Enemy, 1979). Man's nonlogical thought and his emotions are two of his strongest allies in the war against the Berserkers, strategies that the Shaw of Back to Methuselah might not have approved. Berserker or Robbie the Robot, however, machines have no mercy, no imagination, and are immune to argument, so it is not unreasonable for humans to respond with dread - the dread voiced by Shaw in Heartbreak House, of fear and alarm and a call to action. Indeed, if the logic of the machine pursued to its conclusion results at worst in human extinction or at best in hideous stasis, then humans must resort to drastic preventative measures. We cannot return to some lost Eden where no machines intrude, no matter how we might wish. As Zoo in Back to Methuselah reminds the Elderly Gentleman, "How often must I tell you that we are made wise not by the recollections of our past, but by the responsibilities of our future" (16:164). Similarly, in Player Piano, Vonnegut demonstrates that utopia (or any good society) can no more come about without technology than technology can manufacture one. We have only the choice of either smashing the machines before they take us too far - - or of capitulating, which is the third reaction. The Elderly Gentle- man often collapses in defeat, crying such lines as "I can bear this no longer" and "I shall drown myself" (16:141, 145). This is Shavian drollery, of course, but in science fiction capitulation is a response that includes the extent to which humans may be controlled by machines and machinelike systems, and the extent to which humans themselves are or may become machines. An early and well-known example of machines forming the next stage in human evolution is Clifford Simak's City (1952), where a human family leaves its responsibilities to the robot butler, Jenkins, to such a point that the humans disappear from earth and even lose human form. Other notable practitioners include the Alfred Bester of The Demolished Man (serialized 1952), the Silverberg of Dying Inside (1972), and Vonnegut, whose novel The Sirens of Titan (1959) bespeaks the mechanization of humans, the characters seeming to accept that humanity is basically unimportant. Closely linked is cyberpunk fiction, in which biological barriers are overcome and the issue of humanism is irrelevant. An ineluctable cultural malaise tends to disable</page><page sequence="14">94 JEFFREY M. WALLMANN cyberpunk characters, allowing insight to remain but making action impossible. Michael Swanwick's In the Drift (1986) exemplifies the dysto- pian post-holocaust milieu in which the crippled society shows no capacity for regeneration, only further disintegration, eventually to be replaced by a machine civilization. Or, as Cain says near the end of Back to Methuselah, "There is no place for me on earth any longer" (16:260). Such are the prophecies foreshadowed by the Shaw of Back to Methu- selah. Moreover, his seventy-five-year-old message is as current as tomor- row's headlines, for rapid technological progress in electronic, biomedicai, genetic engineering has put us in an era of participant evolution. Children clutch plastic computers that flash not pictures but "graphics." Youths concentrate on video games, bodies moving in rhythm to complex feedback mechanisms. Adults lock into the Internet and World Wide Web in looped circuits of eyes, fingers, and CTR screens. Our flesh and bone become exhausted, defeated by the hard- and soft-ware of obdurate machines. Who controls what, or what con- trols whom, or is the meshing of human and machine indistinguishable? We may need to change our definition of "human." If this is what we are to become - Shavian beings without emotional tone - then perhaps machines represent in symbolic form Shaw's next stage in human evolution. In which case, we should take heed of his dystopic, if not dyspeptic, cautionary dramas and futuristic visions, and accept a mea- sure of chaos in preference to the sterility and regimentality of logic. Shaw's vision of man in relation to scientific materialism, although changing over time, has become part of the modern science fiction idiom, subtly infusing its themes and language with his images and concepts. As long as science fiction is engaged with developments in science and technology, the foreshadowings in Shaw's dramas are still relevant to serious speculation, his writing still inspirational for satire and irony. It is due time, after almost eighty years of modern science fiction, that Shaw be acknowledged for his contribution to enriching and broadening and preparing science fiction for whatever awaits it in the next millennium.
