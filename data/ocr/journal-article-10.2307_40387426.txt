The Pilbara evidence is compared to that from elsewhere in northern Australia. The Pilbara is within the macro-blade distribution area of northern Australia (Figure 1 ). Macro-blades (defined below) are widely distributed throughout northern Australia, over an area extending from Darwin in the north to the Great Victoria Desert in the south and from Onslow in the west to Cheviot Range in the east. In the Pilbara macro-blade quarries occur in numbers stretching from the coast (Akerman 1976b; Vinnicombe 1987) as far inland as the south-eastern side of the Hamersley Ranges (Figure 2, Figure 1. Distribution of macro-blades in northern Australia (after Allen 1997:368; see also Tibbett 2006:28) Archae-aus Pty Ltd, PO Box 177 South Fremantle, fiona@archae-aus.com.au Figure 9) (Akerman 1976a, 1976b; Bradshaw et al. 1996; Brown 1987; Dortch and Bordes 1977; Hook, Hammond et al. 2002; Hook, Veitch et al. 2000a,. 2000b; Strawbridge 1993; Veitch, Hook et al. 2002). Systematic pedestrian surveys for CRM purposes around Paraburdoo (Figure 2, Figure 5) have identified large numbers of macro-blades in contexts ranging from isolated artefacts through to extensive quarry workshops. Three features of macro-blade reduction and distribution have been identified at Paraburdoo. Firstly, macro-blades are manufactured primarily from banded iron formation and dolerite, with a demonstrably different reduction technique employed for each lithology. Secondly, there is discrete spatial patterning in the selection of these materials that has no obvious basis in resource availability. Thirdly, there is a correlation between site type and lithology: banded iron formation blades occur in habitation sites while dolerite macro-blades do not. This paper describes the Paraburdoo macro-blade reduction techniques and their spatial patterning at Paraburdoo and develops an explanation of why the patterning occurs, especially in relation to their intended use. This is then discussed in light of evidence from elsewhere in northern Australia. Figure 2. Inland Pilbara. 23</page><page sequence="2">Paraburdoo Macro-blades Definition As in other areas of northern Australia the most common term in the Pilbara for macro-blades is leilira (see Akerman 1976b; Graham and Thorley 1996; McCarthy 1976; Mulvaney 1975: 74-75). Other terms used include ridged blades (Thorley et al. 1993), large blades (Allen 1997) and prismatic blades (Dortch and Bordes 1977). All refer to "massive, pointed trigonal primary flakes" (Mulvaney 1975: 74-75) or "an elongate blade trapezoid in section" (McCarthy 1976: 35) and as with most definitions there is dispute regarding the correct usage (Akerman 2007; Graham and Thorley 1996). Akerman (1976b: 177; 2007: 23) suggests, based on the first use of the term, that leilira should only be used to refer to silcrete/quartzite blades that are more than 120 mm in length. The large blades at Paraburdoo, therefore, do not fit Akerman's (1976b: 177; 2007) definition for a leilira as they are manufactured from dolerite and ironstone/banded iron formation, with some in chert, mudstone and silcrete. Furthermore they are on average 72 mm long which is much smaller than the lengths for leilira. Therefore, the term macro-blade has been used here to define a flake as least twice as long as it is wide, with parallel or sub parallel lateral margins and more than one parallel arris (central dorsal ridge) and measuring more than 40 mm long (although often the average lengths are closer to 70 mm). In cross section it will be either trapezoid or triangular (Figure 3, Figure 4). Associated cores and debitage feature 90° platform angles, overhang removal, parallel arrises and parallel margins (Figure 7, Figure 8). Figure 3. Macro-blade ventral and dorsal surfaces, Channar Ranges (Hammond et al. in prep.). 24 Figure 4. Macro-blades from a dolerite quarry, Bellary/Considerable Creek (from Hook, Veitch et al. 2000). Distribution The macro-blades were recorded during cultural resource management assessments conducted since 1998 for Pilbara Iron (Dias et al. 2003; Hammond and Dias 2002; Hammond and Rapley 2006; Hammond et al. in prep.; Hook 1999, 2002; Hook, Jackson et al. 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 1998d; 1999; Hook and Martin 2000; Hook, Martin et al. 2003; Hook and Veitch 1999, 2003; Hook, Veitch et al. 2000b; Veitch 2001; Veitch, Hook et al. 2001, 2002; , 2004; Veitch and Martin 2002). All survey work was conducted with the approval and assistance of the Yinhawangka traditional owners. Archaeological surveys occurred in five areas, all on the southern edge of the Hamersley Plateau, and covered a total area of 184 km- (Figure 5). The terrain of four areas includes steep-sided ranges incised by gullies and ravines and associated alluvial flats at the base of the Hamersley Ranges. The fifth area is a low lying undulating alluvial valley that runs along Bellary/Considerable Creek to the north of the Paraburdoo Range. More than 380 sites have been recorded, including small task-specific artefact scatters, habitation artefact scatters, quarries and rock shelters with habitation evidence. Given the geology of the Hamersley Plateau the landscape consists of an abundance of volcanic, sedimentary and metamorphic raw materials with good to excellent conchoidal fracturing qualities. As a result the spatial patterning of flaked artefacts is not constrained by quarry location as good quality isotropie stone is always nearby.</page><page sequence="3">Macro-blades have been identified at 1 10 of the 380 sites (29%). Thirty-six sites (32%) are quarries where macro- blades were manufactured and 28 (25%) are habitation sites with macro-blades as part of their assemblages. The remainder were recorded in single event blade reduction sites or as isolated artefacts. Over 138 complete macro- blades have been recorded. They are manufactured from four lithologies dominated by dolerite (48%) and banded ironstone formation/ironstone (44%) with much lesser amounts of chert/chalcedony (4%), silcrete (2%) and mudstone (2%). This paper focuses on the dolerite and banded iron formation blades because of their high numbers. The mean length of 127 blades available for measurement is 72 mm, with those manufactured from dolerite slightly smaller than banded ironstone blades (Table 1 ). The most interesting factor is that their measurements are so similar given the range of different raw materials.

The 61 banded iron formation macro-blades are manufactured by single-event core reduction with the cobbles sourced from the immediate area. Fourteen single core reduction events have been recorded with the cores and resultant conjoining showing an efficient reduction sequence and a limited amount of waste material. Figure 7 shows a large cobble which is long and narrow, perhaps assisting in the Control of the dorsal ridging allowing long flakes to be removed. The cores are small and would have been held in the hand to flake, perhaps similarly to the process described by Akerman (1976b, 2007: 26). Macro- blades were produced from a core on the fourth or fifth strike and typically a single core reduction resulted in ten pieces of debitage including the core (Figure 7). A very different reduction strategy was utilised for the 66 dolerite macro-blades. The source of dolerite is large boulders scattered across an undulating plain and low hills. Dolerite is quarried on a large scale, with 40 quarries recorded along a 50 km long transect through the plain (Hook, Veitch et al. 2000b). Quarrying and core reduction has resulted in large amounts of waste material with one site having over 1 m depth of debitage, extending over an area of 1,250 m2. Cores can be very large (c. 300 mm long) indicating that the reduction method of resting the core on the ground would have been used, at least in the initial reduction (Akerman 2007: 26) (Figure 8). Turning to spatial patterning, the banded iron formation blades are found in habitation sites, task-specific sites, as isolated artefacts and are restricted to the southern side of the Paraburdoo range (Figure 5, Figure 6). Nine of them exhibit retouch/utilisation with six retouched on both left and right lateral margins. All are located in large habitation sites which have high lithological and artefact diversity. In contrast, only four dolerite blades have been recorded in habitation locations, all in the Bel lary /Considerable Creek area. These habitation sites have large amounts of blade manufacturing debris and numerous large seed grinding millstones and mullers. As the sites are open surface scatters, the contemporaneity of the habitation and quarrying cannot be determined. The spatial distribution of the banded ironstone versus dolerite blades shows quite distinct patterning where: • banded ironstone blades are located to the south of the Eastern Ranges and occur in habitation sites: • dolerite blades are restricted to the northern side of the ranges and do not occur in habitation sites This patterning is not the result of the ranges forming a barrier. There are a number of low points, where the creeks/rivers cut through, that would have allowed easy access to both sides of the range. The presence of three dolerite blades on the southern side of the range further supports this. Thus while the reduction techniques and the 26 raw materials are different, the resultant blades are very similar and their distribution across the landscape is very different. Does their intended use(s) affect their eventual discard locations, as has been suggested for elsewhere in northern Australia (Allen 1997: Graham and Thorley 1996: 75: Jones and White 1988)?

Baler and pearl shell trade routes through the Pilbara. (After Akerman 1973, Akerman and Stanton 1994.) Discussion What behaviour is determining this pattern of macro-blade distribution? It is hypothesised that the macro-blade manufacture and distribution in Paraburdoo may be the result of broadly different uses - utilitarian and ceremonial/ exchange. Exchange In Northern Australia, Central Australia and north-west central Queensland the existence of large quarry sites, the absence of whole macro-blades from habitation sites, and their general absence from dated contexts are interpreted as evidence for their role in late Holocene localised exchange networks (Allen 1997; Graham and Thorley 1996; Moore 2003; Paton 1994; Tibbett 2006). Macro-blade temporal and spatial distribution is unusual in that: 1. they appear to be a recent technological development dated to the last 1500 years; 2. they have a wide distribution across northern Australia; 3. there are numerous large scale quarry workshops with thousands of 'rejected' blades; 4. they are generally absent from habitation sites. One suggestion is that there was increased production of macro-blades as a reaction to contact with Europeans, driven by a wish to obtain European goods and other exotic items (cf. Akerman 1976b; Allen 1997; Thomson 1949: 121); 'our hypothesis is that the desirability of new (European) materials and goods stimulated the growth of a continent wide trade network' (Graham and Thorley 1996: 75). Items such as blades manufactured for trade were often produced in areas remote from direct access to Europeans (Graham and Thorley 1996; McBryde 1987; Mulvaney 1976; Thomson 1949). The banded iron formation macro-blades from Paraburdoo do not fit this pattern. They are located in habitation sites, some have evidence of utilisation, and they are produced in small localised quarries that produce small amounts of waste. Conversely the dolerite macro-blades are not found in habitation sites and they are produced at quarries with large amounts of waste. The only difference is the raw material choice. In northern Queensland, the size of the blades has been identified as a distinguishing factor, with the largest blades used for ceremonies/exchange (Allen 1997:369; Moore 2003:6; Tibbett 2006:26). However, around Paraburdoo there is no real size difference between the blades. Paton (1994: 181) suggests that the presence of deliberately broken blade fragments in habitation sites may be the result of reducing the number of exchange goods in a system so as to preserve their social value. There is no evidence in Paraburdoo for any broken dolerite blades in habitation sites, suggesting that there was no attempt to reduce their numbers in this way. Lithic raw materials are not a constraining factor in this area and suggestions that blades are absent from habitation sites because of 'recycling' is also not a suitable explanation (Akerman 1976b; Tibbett 2006:29). In the habitation sites six of the 28 have other artefact types as part of their assemblage. They are low in number in their respective assemblages (&lt;5%) and do not show the characteristics of macro-blade manufacture. One of the features of northern Australian macro-blades quarries whose blades are utilised in exchange networks is the often restricted nature of access to the quarry source (Paton 1994:177). Ethnographic evidence from the Yinhawangka elders suggests that two of the quarries in the Paraburdoo region were associated with initiation ceremonies and that access was once restricted. This may suggest that the resultant blades from the dolerite quarries were also once restricted. The archaeological evidence suggests that their distribution was regulated and was restrictive. Indigenous people living around Paraburdoo, on the southern edge of the range, were in a prime position to trade with groups both further inland and those who lived along the Ashburton River (Figure 2, Figure 9). The trade of baler and pearl shell (used in ceremonies) from the Kimberley and the Pilbara coast into the Western Desert has been documented (Figure 9) (Akerman 1973; Akerman and Stanton 1994; Graham and Thorley 1996:75-76; McBryde 1987). As would be expected, extensive trade networks occurred across the Hamersley Range and into the Western Desert, and ethnographic evidence suggests the trading of artefacts and ceremonies inland from the coast. The Kurrama, who share a north-eastern boundary with the Yinhawangka, recorded the following: All the tribes used to trade with each other . . . they would trade to get things like the sawfish teeth they used to 27</page><page sequence="6">make the woomera . . . baler shells to carry water . . . white pearls, too - nyamarra, to put on the boys at Law time. And the poisonous spike from stingrays, they used to trade them up from the coast for magic. They'd get their shells, and they'd trade spears, boomerangs, shields or something for them (Brehaut and Vitenbergs 2001:32). The antiquity of exchange networks that included baler shell is similar to that of the dated contexts for Pilbara macro-blades. Baler shell fragments are dated to younger than c. 981 cal BP (Hook, Veitch et al 2000a; Stevens 2002; Veitch, Hook et al 2005) in the Hamersley Range and younger than e. 2260 cal BP in the Great Sandy Desert further inland (Smith and Veth 2004). European goods were a part of the Pilbara system very soon after settlement, with a metal axe observed in 1875 at a camp at Rudall River (Warburton 1875: 267), well before European settlement of the area. The archaeological evidence suggested to Allen (1997) that macro-blade production occurred after 3000 years ago with a dramatic increase after 1300 years ago. In the Pilbara, two banded iron formation macro-blades dated to c. 409 cal BP were identified at one Paraburdoo site (Hook et al 1998c), but no dolerite macro-blades have been identified in sub-surface contexts, although more than 20 rock-shelters have been excavated (Hook, Dias et al in prep; Hook, Jackson et al 1998c; Veitch, Hook et al 2005). In the wider Pilbara, macro-blades do occur in limited numbers in archaeological contexts in sites at Pannawonica, Packsaddle and West Angelas, although the identification of the blades at Packsaddle and Pannawonica needs to be reassessed (Brown 1987; Dias et al 2006; Quartermaine et al 1991) (Table 2). As suggested by Allen (1997: 372) the two blades dated to 10,000 BP from Newman XXIX (Brown 1987; Maynard 1980) held at the WA Museum were inspected and found to be small (&gt;20 mm) parallel sided flakes with no dorsal ridging.

Radiocarbon dates for blades in the Pilbara. Utilitarian Use Across northern Australia, a range of secular uses has been identified for macro-blades using ethnohistorical and ethnographic information (cf. Akerman 2007), including their use as spear tips for hunting and warfare, as fighting 'picks', knives and engraving tools (Akerman 1976b: 117; Allen 1997: 357-8; Brown 1983: 190-191; Cane 1984:160- 1; Graham andThorley 1996: 85; Jones and White 1988: 51; Spencer 1896 vol 4: 93; Spencer and Gillen 1899: 589-590; Thomson 1949). For the Pilbara, no historical or ethnographic data has been collected regarding their use. There is little discussion in the local archaeological literature apart from a vague reference to their use as trade items or as spear points (see for example Australian Interaction Consultants 2007; Williams 2008). Brown (1983:190-191) experimented replicating the engraving of a fat-tailed macropod using basalt macro- blades near Paraburdoo. The blades were selected owing to the proximity of a basalt/dolerite blade quarry to an engraving site. Brown concluded that the blades produced grooves similar to the original engravings. Unfortunately he did not compare field-collected macro-blades with the experimental blades for similar usewear and it is surprising that such a study has not occurred. Akerman (1976b: 118) also suggests that dihedral burins made on large blades in Dampierland in the Kimberley were 'perhaps utilised for the incising of pearl-shell ornaments as well as for engraving wooden artefacts'. Detailed residue analysis of a range of blades and debitage will aid in distinguishing whether Brown's proposition is correct or whether the Paraburdoo blades were used to engrave shell and/or wood. Two uses of macro-blades have been recorded from Indigenous people in the inland Pilbara. Firstly, Banyjima elders in the Yandicoogina area and Yinhawangka elders in the Paraburdoo area have stated that certain dolerite blade quarries, where the raw material has very specific characteristics, are still utilised for the manufacture of artefacts for ceremonies. Secondly, Yinhawangka, Kurrama and Banyjima elders have all described similar techniques used to haft stone blades onto wooden shafts for use as spears. As stated by a Kurruma elder, after the blade has been manufactured, wood is gathered, usually from mulga or similar Acacia species, and hardened/straightened in a fire similar to the way wooden tipped spears are manufactured. The tip end is usually squared off and then split or a groove approximately 3-5 cm in length cut into the shaft. Spinifex resin is softened to be used as glue and placed within this groove and the stone point inserted while the resin is still pliable. While the resin is still soft, kangaroo hamstring/Achilles tendon sinew is wrapped around the groove thus binding the spinifex resin, stone point and wooden shaft tightly together. Once the resin has hardened the spear is ready for use. Spears were used for hunting game such as kangaroo and emu (C. Hammond, pers comm.). Archaeologically there is limited evidence for the use of macro-blades as spear heads. They are not within 28</page><page sequence="7">Davidson's (1935:172-8) hafted spear division which is restricted to the Kimberley and northern Territory, and the ethnohistorical spears from the Pilbara held in the Western Australian Museum and the Australian Museum are constructed entirely of wood, including the spear tips. Nor are there any blades in the museums showing hafting as knives. Spears identified in archaeological contexts are also wooden, or wood and bone composites (Bindon and Lofgren 1982; Veitch, Hook et al 2005). Wright (1968: 62) identified 106 motifs from sites across the Pilbara that depict spears, although the majority do not show the head. Those that do so either show a single barbed head (Wright 1968: Figures 1, 44, 764) or a multiple barbed head (Wright 1968: Figures 205-212, 256, 260, 266, 514, 523, 524). The multiple barb headed spears are always depicted passing through an anthropomorph and are most likely fighting spears (Withnell 1901: 31). Further analysis of rock art depictions of spears in the Pilbara may supply additional information regarding function (cf. Walsh and Morwood 1999). Clearly, apart from the ethnographic evidence, what the blades were used for in the Pilbara remains a question to be answered. Given however, that archaeologically they occur in habitation sites I suggest that they have a utilitarian facies. This is supported by the usewear/utilisation observed on some of the blades. We also have a hint from the ethnography to investigate further whether they were utilised as spear heads. Conclusions Macro blade production in the Paraburdoo area shows two different types of reduction on two different lithic types that produced very similar blades. In other parts of northern Australia 'the only morphological differences among the blades used for various purposes appear to be those of flake size and post-production retouch or hafting' (Allen 1987:368-369). In the Paraburdoo area, however, size does not seem to play a part and there is currently no evidence for hafting. Irrespective of artefact size, discard of the Paraburdoo blades is highly patterned, with dolerite blades not occurring in habitation sites and banded iron formation blades in habitation sites. This patterning is interpreted as representing the manufacture of blades for different purposes - dolerite blades for exchange and banded iron formation blades for some as yet unidentified utilitarian uses. Supporting evidence for the use of the dolerite blades in an exchange network comes from the position of Paraburdoo within the baler and pearl shell exchange network that extended from the Kimberley coast into the Western Desert. This network has been dated to at least as far back as 2260 cal BP. It is also supported by the ethnographic evidence, first of trade of both secular and sacred items from the coast and second that two of the blade quarries were once restricted to men only. Much more work is required to date the pearl/baler shell network by systematically dating shell over its distribution from the coast and into the Western Desert (cf. Smith and Veth 2004). Evidence of the use of banded iron formation macro- blades for utilitarian purposes comes from their presence in habitation sites as whole blades and from retouch/utilisation on a number of these. It also comes from the expedient nature of their manufacture, as single core reduction events that produced one or two blades. This is in contrast to the manufacture of the dolerite blades that produced vast amounts of waste material. Supporting evidence comes from the ethnography that they may have been used as spears, although the ethnohistorical records do not provide any supporting evidence for this. More work is required to try and identify what they were used for. Specifically, usewear/residue analysis may assist in determining whether the blades were used for cutting, sawing, slicing, engraving and whether they were used on plant material, meat or stone. What is pertinent from this research, however, as pointed out by Allen (1987: 368-369), is that it is very difficult to determine the use of a macro-blade just by its shape, size or raw material. It is hoped that more research on the other very large quarries that occur across the Pilbara will aid in determining their role in the prehistory of this part of northern Australia.
