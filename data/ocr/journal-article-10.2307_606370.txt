<plain_text><page sequence="1">CT 13.33-34 AND EZEKIEL 32: LION-DRAGON MYTHS* THEODORE J. LEWIS UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA This article presents the full text of CT 13.33-34, a myth which describes a battle between Tish- pak, the chief god of Eshnunna, and a dragon/serpent creature of immense proportions. It further ex- plores the nature of this composite creature having both leonine and serpentine characteristics (with its iconographic representations). The Canaanite background of the divine battle with the tannin-dragon creature found in Ezekiel 32 is also investigated. A review of the history of scholarship shows that many have perceived the two parallel descriptions of Pharaoh as a lion and a dragon/serpent to be incompatible. This paper argues that there is considerable textual and iconographical justification for associating these two creatures together as symbols of terrifying power. The paper concludes by comparing and contrasting the two texts. INTRODUCTION THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TWO COMBAT myths often left out of discussions of divine-conflict stories, discussions which tend to favor the better-known Mesopotamian tale of Marduk fighting Tiamat and the Canaanite tale of Baal, Anat, and Yahweh fighting the likes of Yamm, Lotan/ Leviathan, and Mot. One of these neglected tales, about the deity Tishpak, comes from the Mesopotamian sphere and reflects my- thology older than Enuma Elish; the other is much later, from Judah's exilic period, and reflects West Semitic de- velopments of the combat myth. The nature of the beasts with whom the deities battle in these stories is singled out for special attention. These two texts show, in conjunction with other literary sources and iconography, that ancient Near Eastern writers and artists used composite animal imagery-in particular, the juxtaposition of lions and dragons-to demonstrate the preeminence of warriors both human and divine. After examining these two myths * I am grateful to William L. Moran, who provided me with several insightful readings, and Karel van der Toorn, who pro- vided me with several texts not otherwise available. Shortcom- ings remain my own.

CT 13.33-34 The Deity Tishpak Tishpak succeeded Ninazu as the chief god of Esh- nunna (Tell Asmar).1 Remarkably, there has been little at- tention devoted to this deity in the standard treatments of Mesopotamian religion, even though he may have been a prototype of Marduk. Tishpak has been thought to be a god of thunderstorms;2 Jacobsen even connected him with the Hurrian god Teshup.3 It is clear that he does act in the manner of a storm god in his battle with the dragon, yet, as Wiggermann has argued (using Marduk and Ninurta 1 T.

Both figures 1 and 2 come from Tell Asmar. Figure 1 shows two unknown gods5 battling the seven-headed dragon. Three of its heads are engaged in battle while the other four droop down as if already slain. Similarly, the bottom register of figure 2 shows an unknown god holding two heads that he had cut off from the monster. Though both images come from Tell Asmar, we must remain cautious about associating them at once with Tishpak. Tishpak's battles with the basmu and the Muvllabbu are attested (see below), but not his battle with the seven-headed serpent.6 We have two other Old Akkadian representations from Eshnunna (one of which is depicted in figure 3) which are 4 F A.

Rendsburg, "UT 68 and the Tell Asmar Seal" Orien- talia 53 (1984): 448-52, suggests that this seal is "but another example of the continuous narrative or linear sequence in an- cient art" (p. 452). Thus he advocates only one deity here at- tacking the dragon twice. 6 On the other hand, Ninurta's battle with the seven-headed serpent is documented (see note 104 below). Fig. 3. H.

W. King12 and Alexander Heidel,13 both of which are now quite outdated. Two new translations, by J. Bottero and S. N. Kramer and by B. R. Foster, have recently appeared.'4 CT 13.33-34 has received particular attention in a recent study by F A. M. Wiggermann.'5 According to Wiggermann, the myth belongs originally to the Old Akkadian Period, and functioned as follows: "It trans- lates history, the Old Akkadian overtake in Esnunna [sic], into theology, and justifies Tispak's accession as king ... as a consequence of his 'liberation' of the nation, sanc- tioned by the decision of a divine council."'6 The full text of what has been preserved of the myth appears as follows: 1. The cities are distraught, The lands [are thrown into confusion], 2. The nations decreased in number, [all of them in mass upheaval]; or pedigrees. Lambert concludes that "the evidence strongly suggests that in Old Akkadian times the mushussu was a symbol of Tispak, god of the town of Esnunna" (p. 92). 9 H.

Foster (Before the Muses, 488) reconstructs "in has[te]." 22 Several different reconstructions have been proposed: (a) Jacobsen ("The Chief God of Eshnunna" 53; cf. Lambert, "Ninurta Mythology," 55) reconstructs the following on the basis of Atrabasis: 3. To their cry of distress no [one ], 4. To their outcry no [one ],22 5. "Who [created] the dragon?" 6. "Sea [created] the dragon." 7. Enlil in heaven drew [its picture]:23 8. Fifty "miles" is his length, One "mile" [his width], 9. Six cubits his mouth, Twelve cubits [his ]; 10. Twelve cubits is the circumference of [his] ea[rs]; 11. At sixty cubits he [can snatch] birds;24 12. In water nine cubits deep he drags [ ]; 13. He raises his tail, he [sweeps the sky]. 14. All the gods of heaven [were afraid(?)]. 15. In heaven the gods bowed down before [Sin], 16. And [they gra]sped(?) Sin's [robe] by its hem: 17. "Who will go and [slay] the raging dragon, 18. [And] deliver the wide land [ ] 19. And exercise kingship [ ]?" 20. "Go, Tishpak, sl[ay] the raging dragon, "Because of their noise [Enlil] cannot .. ;" a-na iq-qil-li-si- na ul [....dEn-lIl ] "because of their roaring he cannot [sleep]" a-na rim- ma-ti-si-na ul i-sab-[bat-su sit-tu]. (b) Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushussu," 117-18) raises several astute objections to Jacobsen's interpre- tation. The outcry here is not to be associated with human noise depriving Enlil of sleep (as with Atrabasis). Rather, the cries of distress here are more likely due to the dragon's presence and hence do not constitute a motive for destruction by Enlil. Wig- germann reconstructs these lines as follows: "to their noise [Furious-Snake does] not [pay attention]" u[l i- qa-al MUS.?US], "on their cries he has no [pity]" i-sab-[bat re-e-ma]. (c) Bottero and Kramer (Lorsque les dieux faisaient l'homme, 464) translate: Mais a leurs cris de d6tresse, [Les dieux] ne [prenaient point garde (?)], Ils ne pre[taient nulle attention (?) a leurs clameurs [...]." 23 Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushussu' 117) reconstructs, "but Enlil in heaven designed [its form]" u-sur- ta-su. Bottero and Kramer (Lorsque les dieuxfaisaient 1'homme, 465, 467) translate "la silhouette (?)" and comment: "il existait, en effect, une constellation dite 'du Dragon', et c'en est apparem- ment la l'etiologie."

The bottom part of the tablet has the common colophon, E.GAL IdAssur-bani(DJU)-apli(DUMU.NITA) LUGAL-SU LUGAL etc. 29 Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mug- hussu," 119) notes that the "kingship that is offered here to the victor is certainly not that over the gods [as in Enuma Elish], but that over the nation he saves from peril." 30 A rare vocative? Cf. von Soden, GAG ?62j. The identity of this deity is not specified, but it is probably the same deity as in lines 15-16 (see note 20 above). 31 This translation follows Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushugssu;' 119) and Bott6ro and Kramer (Lor- sque les dieuxfaisaient l'homme, 465). The syntax is difficult. It is also possible to read dal-hu-ut rather than ri-hu-ut "the thrash- ing (muddying) creatures (pl.) of the River" or "the lord of the (several lines missing.) 1. [DN32] opened his mouth and [spoke] to [Tishpak]: 2. "Burst open the clouds33 [and make(?)] a violent storm; 3. The seal of your life/throat [ ] before you; 4.

He shot (at him) and [slew] the raging dragon. 8. For three years (and) three months, day and [night] 9. The blood of the raging dragon flowed [ stirred up (muddied) waters"(?). Cf. L. W. King's "the raging (creatures) [dalhuti ] of the river" (Enuma Elish, 119), assuming that "the dragon had other creatures to help her in the fight." The context (especially obverse line 6) argues for the present translation with the dragon who is slain being called the "off- spring of River." Syntactically it would be easier to translate "you sent me, lord of the offspring of river ... " (so Foster, Be- fore the Muses, 488). In that case the identity of the deity could be Sea who regretted creating the dragon. This would accord with MAD I, 192 which calls Tishpak abarak tiamtim, "the steward of Tiamat." See A. Westenholz, "Old Akkadian School Texts," AfO 25 (1976-1977): 102; CAD, A/I, 34. 32 Bott6ro and Kramer (Lorsque les dieux faisaient I'homme, 465) reconstruct "[Ea (?)]" as does Foster, Before the Muses, 489. 33 W.

The extant portion contains the beginning and end of the story. At the outset (lines 1-2) we hear of cities in distress. No reason is given, yet Wiggermann's suggestion35 that the disaster is a result of the dragon is very plausible. The people's cries of distress (lines 3-4) go unheeded.36 Someone37 raises the question of the beast's origin (line 5). Sea (tamtu), widely recognized for giving birth to monster serpents and dragons, is the obvious answer, given in line 6. Yet Enlil, as line 7 makes clear, also had a hand in the dra- gon's design.38 A lengthy description of the creature fol- lows (lines 8-13), and it would not be an exaggeration to say that its dimensions (fifty "miles" long and one "mile" wide) are of true mythic proportions (except for the mouth?). In a scene often found in divine combat myths, the pan- theon despairs at the mere sight or description of the op- posing beast (lines 14-16).39 The gods fearfully ask who will slay the dragon and deliver the land (lines 17-18). The reward of kingship is offered to such a victor (line 19). A divine spokesman charges the hero Tishpak with the challenge, repeating in lines 20-22 the words of the 34 Lambert, "Ninurta Mythology," 55. 35 See note 26 above. 36 Due to the broken nature of the text, I prefer not to reconstruct either Enlil (so Jacobsen), the dragon (so Wigger- mann), or the gods (so Bottero and Kramer). See note 26 above. 37 Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushussu, 118) suggests a member of the divine assembly who is then an- swered by a divine messenger "sent by the gods to find out what is happening on earth." 38 It is debatable to what degree Enlil was more involved in this tale. Jacobsen suggested that Enlil decided to destroy man- kind due to its noise that deprived him of sleep. Wiggermann ar- gued against Jacobsen (see note 26 above), proposing that Enlil was angered by the absence of a divine ruler and thus had Sea create the dragon ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushussu," 118, 126). The extant text mentions only Enlil's designing the dragon, nothing of his anger or motive. The broken text does not even say that he was responsible for sending the beast, although this is a logical inference. 39 For Canaanite examples of this pattern see E M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1973), 93. cowering gods. Tishpak at first refuses to fight the dragon, evidently claiming that he is not familiar with his adver- sary's features, capabilities, or modus operandi (lines 23- 24). The text then breaks off with what is perhaps another description of the monster's actions. After presumably being instructed in the art of warfare by a deity (reverse, lines 1-4), Tishpak engages in a cosmic battle with the dragon. The battle scene itself (lines 5-7) involves the storm language of stirred-up clouds, lightning, a violent tempest, and the "cylinder seal of his life/throat," which Jacobsen took to represent thunder.40 The dragon is slain and his blood flows for three years and three months, day and night (lines 8-9). The Depiction of the Dragon The depiction of the dragon is as astonishing as are its proportions. In lines 5 and 6 he is clearly called a serpent (MU?), which accords well with a passage in Der babylo- nische Gottertypentext describing Tishpak as the one who "treads on the serpent with his two (feet)."41 Yet the beast is certainly much more than Wakeman's "giant serpent with a tail."42 Note the physical description of this beast, which exhibits animal characteristics (ears, tail, catching birds) in addition to specifically serpentine characteris- tics (fifty "miles" long, travels through water). A parallel fragment from KAR 643 describes another long basmu- creature with huge eyes whose feet44 take strides twenty "miles" long. Furthermore, this dragon devours fish, birds, wild asses, and even humans. Another indication that we are not dealing with a sim- ple serpent is found in lines 17, 20, 24 (obverse), and 40 Jacobsen, "The Chief God of Eshnunna," 54. Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mushuss'u" 125) argues that we should translate "your/his very own (seal)." Bott6ro and Kramer (Lorsque les dieux faisaient I'homme, 468) suggest "un usage possible de cette masse de pierre, plus ou moins lourde et qui pouvait constituer une arme de choc, comme on contait qu'avait ete assassine le fils du grand Sargon, Rimus...

J. M. Roberts (Earliest Semitic Pantheon, 116, n. 444) relates labbu to West Semitic Iwytn (Hebrew) and Itn (Ugaritic) from the root lawu, "to encircle." labbu would therefore be a parras formation meaning "the twisting one." Yet labbu in our text is never spelled with a long second vowel. In addition, it is a well-known word in Akkadian for "lion," devel- oping as follows: labbu&lt;ldbu&lt;lab'u. 46 "Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon musghugsu," 118. Wig- germann does point out Lambert's attempt to suggest alternative readings to lab-bu (i.e., kal-bu, rib-bu, tan-bu). 47 Cf. also Bott6ro and Kramer, Lorsque les dieux faisaient l'homme, 466. Fig. 7. A. Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1961), plate XXII (=ANEP #297) (Dynasty I; Hierakonpolis [Kom el-Ahmar]). The choice of the word labbu with its leonine conno- tations is likely not accidental. I suggest returning to Heidel's notion of a "composite monster or dragon with leonine and serpentine attributes."48 This recalls E. D. Van Buren's conclusions that "the dragons of later ages all derived from two main types, the leonine and the ophid- ian."49 The juxtaposition of serpent and lion reminds us of the snake (MU?) who steals the plant of life in the Gil- gamesh Epic (XI: 287) and is also called a nesu sa qaqqari, "lion of the ground" (XI: 296). Elsewhere, there is the unusual description of a snake "roaring like a lion" (siri sa ina bitiya kima nesi [UR.MAg] irmumu).50 Wigger- mann notes both an Ur III incantation which mentions "the lion, the mushussu-dragon which lives in the midst of the sea" and several examples of roaring dragons and the equation of dragons with lions.51 It is their iconogra- phy, however, that reveals to us the real nature of how these two images were used by the ancients in a comple- mentary fashion. Iconographic Representations Iconographic representations show that the lion and the serpent/dragon were so closely associated that they could 48 Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, 141.

Van Buren's suggestions that dragons were not hostile to the deities (pp. 1-45 passim) and that the labbu was a male "lion-demon" who served as a counterpart to the female Tiamat (pp. 23-24) must be set aside as uncertain. 50 KAR 388:12. 51 "Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon musihuFssu' 126, n. 5. 34</page><page sequence="8">LEWIS: CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32: Lion-Dragon Myths Fig. 8.

"lion" and mug-dragons are not always distinguished, so that labbu in the Labbu-myth may mean "lion" after all.56 In discussing the god Tishpak it is also relevant to look at descriptions of Ninazu. As mentioned above, Tishpak replaced Ninazu as god of Eshnunna and absorbed many of the latter's characteristics. Therefore the description of Ninazu, found in a Sumerian temple hymn, is particularly significant for our discussion. (Ninazu) is a lion who ..., pouring out poisonous venom over the hostile land, 56 Wiggermann, "Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mus- hussu," 126, n. 5. 55 Boissier, Choix, 63.9. Cf.

He is described as "the one who wields the mace and treads on the serpent/dragon."60 Tiamat's formidable army in- cluded fierce serpent dragons (usumgalle nadruti),6' the serpent (basmu), and the dragon (mushus'su).62 Yet this army also included the great lion (ugallu).63 Furthermore, Tiamat and her retinue are described as "raging" creatures (Tiamat la-ab-bat, her army na-zar- bu-bu la-ab-bu)!64 The connection here between lababu "to rage" and the labbu in the Tishpak text is immedi- ately apparent. Most likely through folk etymology,65 the Tispak, was translated into mythology (as reflected in the cult) and freed the animal of Tispak for use by his adversary Marduk." But note the cautionary remarks of Lambert, "The History of the mus-hus in Ancient Mesopotamia" 87-94, and "Ninurta My- thology," 55-60. Note especially that the mushussu is not re- stricted to Tishpak and Marduk. 60 ta-me-eh me-ti ka-bi-is u-sum-gal-li (KAR 104:29). E.

Therefore, it could be a denominative verb from labbu. However, the deriva- tive libbatu "anger, wrath" occurs from OA and OB on. Thus the connection is probably one of folk etymology. As noted above (note 45), labbu most likely developed labbu&lt;ldbu&lt;lab'u. Doubling is not expressed in OAkk and OA, leading one to sus- pect that labbu might be rendered in those periods as la-bu. From such data it is impossible to tell. However, the spelling of OA ld-db-i-im suggests the development as I have given it. Note the similar development (though with an i vowel) of hittu&lt;hitu&lt;hit'u (von Soden, GAG, ?20d). 37</page><page sequence="11">Journal of the American Oriental Society 116.1 (1996) verb "to rage" was connected with the lion, the animal best known for raging. Thus we get expressions such as ldbis ilabbabu "they raged like a lion" and labbis anna- dirma allabib abibis "I rampaged like a lion, raging like a deluge."66 Thus Marduk fights raging creatures includ- ing the serpent, the dragon, and the lion-as did Tishpak. II. EZEKIEL 32 The first half of Ezekiel 32 contains the sixth prophecy against Egypt and dates (according to the MT of Ezek. 32:167) to March 3, 585, after the destruction of Jerusa- lem. This poem, together with 29:3-5, tells the story, through vivid language, of how Yahweh will bring Pha- raoh Hophra to destruction for his part in the demise of Judah. Scant attention has been paid to the mythological back- drop of this passage, namely Yahweh's combat against the tannin dragon creature.68 Quite often the tannin com- bat myths have been overshadowed by the more famous combat myths of Yahweh battling Yamm, Leviathan, and Mot. Frequently the rich mythic imagery of this text is absent from or obscured by modem English translations. My translation and understanding of this pericope follow. Ezek. 32:2b-8 2b. You are like69 a lion70 among the nations, You are like a dragon71 in the seas. 66 Cf. CAD, L, 7. 67 LXX manuscripts and Syr. put the date at March 13, 586. 68 Note should be made of the following treatments: H. Gun- kel, Schopfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit (G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1921), 71-77; J. Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985), 94-95; Wakeman, God's Battle, 69ff. 69 W. Zimmerli (Ezekiel 2, Hermenia [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1983 (German ed., 1969)], 154) suggests that we could read kkpyr yet acknowledges that a change in the text "is not ab- solutely necessary." Another possible reading for nidmetad in Ezek. 32:2 is "you are destroyed" from DMH II. This would fit the following description of the destruction of the beast. The paral- lelism as well as the versions argue for DMH I. See Zimmerli for bibliography and other suggested emendations. 70 The majority of LXX manuscripts render kepir by leon and tannin by drdkon. It should be noted that, on two occasions (Job 4:10; 38:39), LXX translators chose drakon to translate kepfr (see note 98 below). 71 The spelling of tannfm for the usual tannin occurs here and in Ezek. 29:3. This is either a by-form or a misspelling due per- haps to confusion with the plural of tan. You burst forth in your rivers,72 You stir up the waters with your feet, And foul their73 rivers. 3. Thus says Yahweh:74 I will throw my net over you,75 I76 will haul you up in my dragnet. 4. I will cast you on the ground, On the open field I will fling you.77 I will cause all the birds of the air to settle on you, I will gorge the beasts of the whole78 earth with you. 5. I will strew your flesh upon the mountains, I will fill the valleys with your carcass.79 72 Zimmerli's emendation (Ezekiel, 2:154), "with your nos- trils" (following Ewald; so too W. Eichrodt [Ezekiel (Phila- delphia: Westminster, 1970), 430] and J. W. Wevers [Ezekiel (London: Nelson, 1969), 240-41), is not necessary and has no support in the versions. 73 Many scholars read "your rivers" following LXX; yet MT represents the lectio difficilior. 74 I prefer the shorter reading here. 'ddonay is not in LXX. 75 Viewing, as do most scholars, MT's "with a host of many peoples" as a gloss. 76 Zimmerli is certainly correct when he notes (Ezekiel, 2:155) that MT's plural verb was a later accommodation to the gloss mentioned in the previous note. LXX's first person (with Yah- weh as subject) is preferable. Thus read hacdlitika. 77 The Vorlage underlying the LXX reading ("will be full of you") seems to be ml'k, as noted by Zimmerli (Ezekiel, 2:155) and others. The graphic similarity between ml'k and MT's 'tylk is apparent. It is hard to say which reading led to the other, yet the occurrence of ml' in the next verse may have occasioned the mistake. The consistent use of the first person throughout this passage would also seem to argue for .tylk. On the other hand, this consistency could also have influenced an assimila- tion of an original ml'k to '.tylk. 78 Scholars commonly read kl hyt h'rs (or hsdh) following LXX as opposed to MT's hyt kl h'rs. MT's is a lectio difficilior while the LXX reading more likely assimilates to the kl Cwp of the preceding verse and/or the frequent expression kl hyt hsdh in Ezek. 31:6, 13; 34:5, 8; 39:17. 79 MT's "with your height" is perplexing. G. A. Cooke (The Book of Ezekiel, ICC [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1936], 348) suggests "high heaps of bodies." LXX apb tou haimatos sou ("from your blood") seems to be occasioned by the same ex- pression (midddmeka) in the next verse. The translation "car- cass" or "corpse" (see Eichrodt, Zimmerli, and most translations) 38</page><page sequence="12">LEWIS: CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32: Lion-Dragon Myths 6.

All the bright lights of heaven I will blacken over you, I will put darkness upon your land. General Comments Many of the numerous mythological motifs underly- ing this passage have been detailed elsewhere and need only briefly be summarized.84 The dragon's churning in the waters in 32:2b is found also at Ugarit (KTU 1.83.3- 7). The enmeshing of the dragon in 32:3 reminds one of Marduk's battle against Tiamat (Enuma Elis, tablet IV.41, 95, 107, 112). The use of the slain carcass as food for birds and beasts in 32:4 (cf. 29:5) finds a direct parallel in the tannln/Leviathan passage in Ps. 74:13.85 The size is derived from RMM, "to rot, decay" (cf. rimmd; Arabic ramma; Ugaritic rmm). This translation is followed by the majority of scholars who read rimmatekd (cf. Sym. ton skolekon soi). For yet another, although less likely, alternative, see L. Boadt, Ezek- iel's Oracles Against Egypt (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1980), 137-38. 80 MT's 'el hehdrim "even to the mountains" seems to be a gloss occasioned by verse 5a. Zimmerli notes (Ezekiel, 2:155) that this could have been added secondarily to contrast 'dpiqfm. 81 sapdtekd is a hapax legomenon seemingly from swp "to flow." The meaning (given the following midddmeka "from your blood" which seems to be a gloss) certainly has to do with blood. Other scholars (e.g., H. Gunkel, Schopfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit, 73) emend to s'tk with the same meaning "your issue/outflow (of bodily fluids)." L. Boadt's suggestion (Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt, 139) that we keep the entire MT as a tri- colon, while plausible, is not probable. 82 Zimmerli (Ezekiel, 2:155) and others read midddmeka "of your blood" for MT's mimmeka, "of you." 83 Though Yahweh as the subject is unexpressed, it is implied. 84 Cf. H. Gunkel, Schopfung und Chaos in Urzeit und End- zeit, 71-77. 85 I am not saying that I have exhausted the author's raw ma- terial when I underscore the imagery of divine combat myths underlying this material. Zimmerli (Ezekiel, 2:160, n. 12, fol- lowing Miller) notes how similar vocabulary may be found in human battle scenes, such as those described in the annals of Tiglath-Pileser III. of the dragon mentioned in 32:5-6 is described by Eich- rodt "as being so enormous that its decaying masses [sic] fill the mountains and valleys and its life-blood floods the earth and causes a spate in the watercourses."86 This too is reminiscent of the Labbu's proportions, as well as Tiamat's huge carcass out of which Marduk is able to fashion heaven and earth (Enima Elis, tablet IV.129ff.). The large amount of blood in 32:6 which drenches the entire land finds its most direct parallel in the Labbu text, above, which describes the blood of the slain dragon flowing without stop for three years and three months. Lastly, the resulting darkness mentioned in 32:7-8 is oc- casionally associated with dragon creatures (Job 3:8-9; cf. Ps. 44:20); however, "darkness" is more at home in cosmic eschatologies denoting judgment (cf., for ex- ample, Joel 2:10; 3:3-4; 4:15). The Depiction of the Beast(s) The tannin-creature in Ezek. 32:2 occurs frequently in the Bible, including the parallel passage, also concern- ing Pharaoh, in Ezek. 29:3-5. A study of the descrip- tions of this creature reveals a mixing of dragon and lion imagery. At times tannin seems to be a simple serpent, as when it parallels peten (Ps. 91:13). Compare the same parallel- ism in Deut. 32:33 and KTU 1.3.3.37-38. When Moses' rod turns into a tannin (Exod. 7:9-12), a serpent is surely in mind. Elsewhere, however, the tannin is much more than a serpent and not just the crocodile of outdated scholarship.87 This dragon creature, occurring in parallel to Yam (Job 7:12),88 Leviathan (Ps. 74:13; Isa. 27:1), and Rahab (Isa. 51:9), is slain by Yahweh, the Divine War- rior. A mythological dragon bearing the same name (tnn)89 is also known from Ugarit, where he is slain by Anat (KTU 1.3.3.37-39; cf. KTU 1.83.3-11) and Baal (KTU 1.82.1; cf. KTU 1.5.1.1-5). It seems likely that the 86 Eichrodt, Ezekiel, 432-33. Cf. Zimmerli, who remarks: "the 'monster' is not simply a normal beast of normal size, but... a 'world beast' of cosmic dimensions" (Ezekiel, 2:160). 87 For a critique of those equating the tannin-dragon with a crocodile, see J. Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, 94-95. This is not to say that divine combat myths did not often utilize hunting imagery. Cf. K. W. Whitney, "The Place of the 'Wild Beast Hunt' of Sib. Or. 3.806 in Biblical and Rabbinic Traditions" JSJ 25 (1994): 68-81. 88 Cf. D. A.

He is certainly much more than a simple serpent. He even has feet! (Compare figures 1 and 14.) Yet there is one element of the description of the dragon-creature I have skipped over which has proven somewhat difficult for commentators both ancient and moder. How does one integrate the imagery of a lion that occurs parallel to the tannin in 32:2? The Labbu text examined above may provide a possible ancient Near Eastern backdrop. In 32:2 Pharaoh is described as follows: keptr goyim nidmeta we-'attd kat-tannim92 bay-yammim You are like a lion among the nations, You are like a dragon in the seas. How can Pharaoh be likened to a lion and a serpent/ dragon at the same time? Eichrodt describes this verse as difficult precisely because of the "juxtaposition of such conflicting objects of comparison as a young lion and a dragon,"93 and Boadt states similarly that the "mytho- poeic image of a lion stands opposed to that of a tannin."94 Fohrer95 and BH3 even suggest that we make the lion dis- appear by emending kepir, "lion," to kept (or kem6) dag yam, "like a fish of the sea." This supposed incompatibility is not felt just by mo- dern commentators. This tension is found in Targum Jonathan and resolved through typical metaphorical trans- lation: "You were mighty among the nations" (taqqtp bdcamemayyd). 90 Cf. M. Dahood, Psalms, Anchor Bible, vol. 17 (Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1968), 2:199, 206; and 0. Eissfeldt, "Gott und das Meer" in Kleine Schriften, vol. 3 (Tiibingen: J. C. B.

Fohrer, Ezechiel, HAT (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1955), 177. Rashi felt that the lion and the dragon were incompat- ible and therefore treated the waw of we-9attd in Ezek. 32:2 as disjunctive. You should have been as one lying about in your river according to the manner of fish, and you should not have gone out to the dry land. But you exalted yourself and likened yourself to a lion, the ruler over the dry land, and you went out to tear prey. Rashi's notion of contrasting these two creatures has been widely accepted by many commentators. The fol- lowing translation is indicative of many: You consider yourself a lion among the nations, However you are only a tannin in the seas.96 Though this translation is possible, I believe the cor- rect interpretation lies elsewhere. I have tried to demon- strate that there is considerable justification for linking these two creatures in both literature and artistic repre- sentation by means of evidence especially from Meso- potamia, the geographical setting for Ezekiel's poems. Any incompatibility between lions and serpent/dragons lies more in the moder mind than the ancient. Additional Biblical Juxtapositions of Lions and Serpent/Dragons An investigation into several biblical passages shows that these two creatures were juxtaposed in Isra- elite as well as in Mesopotamian tradition. Ps. 91:13 presents the very same pairing as the Ezekiel passage: 96 Boadt, Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt, 129; S. Freehof, Book of Ezekiel (New York: UAHC, 1978), 184-85; W. Eichrodt, Ezekiel, 430; J. B. Taylor, Ezekiel (Downers Grove, Ill.: Inter- Varsity, 1969), 208; W. H. Boulton, The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel (Birmingham: Christadelphian, 1962), 137; D.

Elsewhere, Isaiah (while castigating Israel for looking to Pharaoh for protection) declares an oracle concerning the animals of the Negev: be'eres sard we-siuq Idbi' wa-layis mehem 'epeh we-sdarp me'opep Through a land of trouble and anguish, From where come the lioness and lion, The viper and the darting snake. (Isa. 30:6)97 The lion and the serpent are also linked, along with the bear, as dangerous objects of encounter in Amos 5:19: kadaser yanus 'ts mippene ht'adri upegad haddob abda habbayit we-sdmak yddo Cal haqqtr unesakB hannahas It will be as though someone fled from a lion only to be met by a bear, As though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him.98 S. Mowinckel, followed by M. Pope, has argued that sahal, a common Hebrew word for "lion," is in fact equal to "a fabulous beast of the serpent (dragon) type" in Job 28:8.99 Whether or not Mowinckel is right in this 97 The oracle here is against the bahdmot of the Negev. Com- pare also the parallel between behemot and zohale Capar (ser- pents?) in Deut. 32:24. See too the broken text in CTA 19:223, where lion may be parallel to serpent. 98 For yet further collocations of lions and dragons, one should also compare Job 4:10 and 38:39. In both of these pas- sages kepir is rendered by LXX as drdkon (see note 70 above). Should one counter (weakly, in my opinion) that the LXX Vor- lage of each of these passages was tannin (the most common word translated by drdkon), the collocation would still be intact (tannin//'aryeh, labi3, or sahal). 99 S. Mowinckel, "sahal," in Hebrew and Semitic Studies Presented to G. R. Driver, ed. D. W. Thomas and W. D. McHardy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), 95-103; M. Pope, Job, Anchor Bible, vol. 15 (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1965), 202. Mo- winckel reconstructs as follows: "Originally 'nur may have meant the serpent dragon, the mythical wyvern or 'Lindwurm'. Because of the combination of serpent (dragon) and lion in my- thopoetical and artistic fancy [see the discussion of iconography above], it has also been adopted as a term for the lion" (p. 103). equation, we do have sahal and tannin closely associ- ated in Job. In Job 28:8 sahal occurs parallel to bene sd- has (usually translated "proud or haughty beasts') over which tannin is said to be king (hui melek Cal kol bene sahas [Job 41:26]).100 Mowinckel goes on to mention the connection between the lion and the serpent in the etymologies of Hebrew nahas "serpent" = Akkadian nesu "lion" and Ethiopic 'arwe "serpent" = Hebrew 'aryeh, 'drf "lion."101 Can tannin Be Equated with muhbussu? One wonders what Ezekiel and his audience in Baby- lonia pictured when they used the word tannin, particu- larly when tannin referred to a mythological dragon. The ancient Near Eastern cosmological dragon was a composite creature. Is it too far-fetched to imagine that they equated the tannin dragon-creature with the mus- hussu dragon regularly represented on the Ishtar Gate and elsewhere? III. LIONS, (SERPENT-)DRAGONS, AND DIVINE WARRIORS As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, the as- sociation of the lion and the serpent/dragon presents no problems. Here I show that "divine warrior" texts are a very common genre where these two creatures occur, similar to Ezekiel 32 in portraying Yahweh as the Divine Warrior conquering the lion and the tannin. The lion and the serpent/dragon are used in two pri- mary ways in warrior contexts, the first dealing with the actual conquest of these beasts and the second identify- ing the warrior with the creature itself. Both the lion and the serpent/dragon were creatures of power to be feared by humans. Thus it was that a warrior might demonstrate his great ability by overcoming this fear and conquering them. For example, Sulgi describes his ability in the hunt: 100 bene sdihas occurs only in Job 28:8 and 41:26. 101 S. Mowinckel, "sahal," 98. This was previously recog- nized by P. Jensen in his review of R. Campbell Thompson's The Epic of Gilgamesh, in OLZ 32 (1929): 650. S. A. Kaufman (personal communication) has drawn my attention to the fact that the Ethiopic expression for a serpent is actually 'arwe medr, "animal of the ground," not 'arwe alone. See W. Leslau, Com- parative Dictionary of Gecez (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1987), 40. On the other hand, Mowinckel's suggestion ("saahal," 100) that ndhasg can equal sahal through a roundabout reciprocal dissimilation and metathesis (nhs&gt;lhs&gt;s'hl) is strained. 41</page><page sequence="15">Journal of the American Oriental Society 116.1 (1996) Fig. 18.

R. Castellino, Two Sulgi Hymns (Rome: Istituto di Studi del Vicino Oriente, 1972), 36- 39, 117-119 (IV. 60-62, 65-67, 75). The royal hunt could go beyond the killing of a simple beast. Compare figure 17 where the lion is portrayed as a fantastic creature with wings and bird- like talons similar to the beast of the divine battle (cf. figure 18). 103 The text and translation are those of J. Cooper, The Re- turn of Ninurta to Nippur (Rome: Pontificium Institutum Bibli- cum, 1978), 145-46. 104 J. Cooper (The Return of Ninurta, 145) translates UR here as lion, yet he questions whether this meaning, which is found mainly in lexical texts, is certain. Surely this is our composite creature. He installed the lion, fear of the gods . . . Because these were his (Ninurta's) slain warriors.1?5 The lion and the serpent/dragon were also symbols of power and strength. Not only could a warrior demonstrate his power by describing his conquest of the lion or the ser- pent, he could lay claim to the same power by identifying himself with the terrifying creature. Sulgi claims to have destroyed the lion and the dragon, yet he also announces: I, the king am a warrior from birth, I, Sulgi, am from birth the powerful man, I am a lion with ferocious look, born of the dragon.106 Compare also Lipit-Istar of Isin: I am a lion who goes before all, I am without opponent. I am a dragon who opens wide the mouth, The great terror of the armies.107 105 The word which Cooper translates "warriors" is ur.sag. The word "warriors" is ambiguous. The context seems to imply that these are his war trophies.

I have cautiously left the translation "beast" yet "lion" may be a better translation. Hallo and Van Dijk's translation "beast" in the last line brings us back to the discussion of UR (see notes 104, 105 above). UR is a "beast" or "carnivore." The context here would strongly suggest that the beast in question is the lion. Inanna/ Ishtar is commonly shown mounted on lions (see, for example, figures 19-22). T. Jacobsen (The Treasures of Darkness, 136, 254, n. 228) takes UR here as lion. A variant reading is ur-a for ur- ra. CAD, N/II, 197 states that the "log. UR.A used as log. for Leo in astron. texts came to be used in astrol. omens as log. for 'lion' instead of UR.MAJ." 44</page><page sequence="18">LEWIS: CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32: Lion-Dragon Myths Fig. 24.

Courtesy of Art Resource. by conquering these creatures or could call himself by the names of these creatures, thereby identifying his power with theirs. A third symbolic use is a mixture of these two. For example, Ninurta, in The Return of Ninurta to Nippur, takes on the features of the "exceedingly mighty lion-headed one of Enlil"125 and "the lion, who received the fearsome me's in Apsu."126 He declares: "My battle, like a great overflowing flood... with a lion's body and a lion's muscles, it rises up in the re- bellious lands."127 Yet in this same text he also is the one who "wields the 7-headed mace which slays the 7-fanged serpent" (see figure 23).128 He hangs on his war chariot the trophies of war including the dragon and the seven-headed serpent129 (see figures 1, 2, and 14). 125 J.

Of relevance is a vase of green steatite found at the Early Dynastic II temple of Inanna at Nippur which shows a lion (or leopard) engaged in battle with a huge serpent (figure 24). On the back of the base is the inscription "Inanna and the serpent"!130 In other words, Inanna, in the form of a feline, is dueling the mythological serpent. Returning to the Bible, we find ample evidence of Yahweh's battling the mythological dragon,131 although Yahweh is never identified with such a beast. There is no explicit reference to Yahweh hunting lions, perhaps be- cause it would have been deemed too anthropomorphic. Yet Yahweh's identification with the lion, the king of the beasts (Prov. 30:30), was a natural development. Yah- weh roars like a lion (Amos 1:2, 3:8) and commands lions for his purposes (1 Kings 20:36). The lion is also used as a metaphor for Yahweh's destructive power un- leashed against his enemies (Isa. 31:4; Hos. 5:14, 13:7- 8; Jer. 49:19). Additional Canaanite material (evaluating Israelite material as Canaanite material) is readily avail- able. For example, Asherah ('atiratu yammi, "she who treads the sea"?) is known as both the "One of the Lion" (labi'tu) and the "One of the Serpent" (tannittu/dat batni).132 130 D. Hansen and G. Dales, "The Temple of Inanna Queen of Heaven at Nippur," Archaeology 15 (1962): 79. This article does not give the inscription. M. K.

The serpent also connotes fertility imagery in many of these depictions. Later examples of the lion-serpent/dragon collocation in battle contexts abound.

COMPARING CT 13.33-34 AND EZEKIEL 32 The Shared Elements of CT 13 and Ezekiel 32 Scholars of the Bible have expended much energy looking for motifs connecting Ezekiel 32 with Egypt, and rightly so.'33 The biblical narrators chose divine combat myths involving dragons or the sea to illustrate ancient Israel's battles with Egypt more than with any other nation.134 Thus scholars illustrate the backdrop of Ezek. 32:2 by depicting life on the Nile (e.g., crocodile hunting) and documenting occurrences of the title "lion" indicating Pharaoh's royal power.135 Unfortunately, such approaches tend to neglect the text's historical context, namely, a prophet who had dwelt in Mesopotamian exile since 597 B.C.E.136 Ezekiel surely drew upon Mesopotamian art and literature to il- lustrate his work for his audience. The historical back- ground underlying Ezekiel's literary activity (between 593-571 B.C.E., to judge from the dates given in the book) falls within the reign of Nebuchadrezzar II (604- 562 B.C.E.), whose achievements include the rebuilding of the Ishtar Gate, itself replete with reliefs of the mus- breathed raging fire . . , who had three heads, one of a grim- eyed lion, another of a goat, and another of a snake, a fierce dragon; in her forepart she was a lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon" (H. G. Evelyn-White, Hesiod: The Homeric Hymns and Homerica [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1967], 102- 3, lines 319-24). 133 This is not the place for a critique of the comparative method and how it is currently being employed. For a recent history of scholarship on the debate, especially as it relates to Akkadian literature, see T. Longman III, Fictional Akkadian Au- tobiography: A Generic and Comparative Study (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1991), 23-36. See also M. Malul, The Com- parative Method in Ancient Near Eastern and Biblical Legal Studies, AOAT 227 (Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1990). 134 On the use of dragons and related beasts as designations for Egypt, see Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, 88-101. 135 See the bibliography in Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, 94-95, as well as the commentaries men- tioned in note 96. 136 This view, of course, gives little credence to past scholars (e.g., C. C. Torrey) who argued that Ezekiel was a pseud- epigraph from 200 B.C.E. For a brief history of research on the provenance of the book of Ezekiel, see Zimmerli, Ezekiel, 1:3- 77) who calls such views as Torrey's "unrestrained hypercriti- cism" (p. 7). hussu-dragon. The same king had also confronted Ho- phra, the pharaoh in Ezekiel 32 (cf. Jer. 37:5). With a nice twist of irony, Ezekiel describes this Babylonian king in the following verses as the one who will bring about Egypt's demise (Ezek. 32:11-14). While Ezekiel 32 is certainly not dependent on the Labbu myth (CT 13.33-34),'37 it is, nonetheless, very instructive to look for common traditions and the shared legacy of motifs. CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32 contain similar images. Both deities direct their attacks against antagonists portrayed with leonine and serpent/dragon imagery. In CT 13.33-34, Tishpak fights what seems to be a compos- ite creature of leonine and dragon character. In Ezekiel 32, the lion and the tannin are not "conflicting objects of comparison" as Eichrodt would have it.'38 Not only are they compatible due to their fearsomeness, they are com- plementary images occurring together, especially in war- rior contexts. In other words, this verse need not contrast Pharaoh as the royal king of the beasts with a lowly dragon creature of the slime and mud.'39 The tannin is no lowly creature who just muddies waters. Rather, he is as awesome and grand as the lion. Pharaoh is then both a mighty lion and a powerful tannin (cf. hattannin hag- gaddl in 29:3) whom Yahweh slays to demonstrate his sovereignty. Tishpak's dragon is a water creature, the "offspring of River," of immense proportions, especially in length (ob- verse, lines 8-12). Likewise, the dragon Yahweh battles is a water creature (32:2) of enormous size, whose carcass is so huge that it fills mountains and valleys (32:5-6). Both dragons are restless creatures. The labbu is "the rag- ing one" who brought destruction to the cities. Pharaoh, notes Ezekiel, also played a part in Israel's demise (29:7). Pictured as a raging dragon, he chums and muddies the water with his thrashing (Ezek. 32:2). It may be possible to describe even Tishpak's dragon as the "lord of the 137 Lambert ("Ninurta Mythology," 56) correctly challenges even those who want to argue for direct dependency between Labbu and Enuma Elish and Anzu. Yet Lambert ("Old Testa- ment Mythology," 138) goes too far when he implies (contrary to Gunkel) that all Tannin and Leviathan material comes from West Semitic traditions without any connection to Mesopota- mian (e.g., Marduk) mythology. It is reasonable to posit Meso- potamian influence given such discoveries as the cuneiform tablets at Ugarit (e.g., Ugaritica V, chapter 5) as well as Meso- potamian literature found in pre-Israelite Canaan (e.g., the Gil- gamesh tablet found at Megiddo; cf. also the Amarna tablets). 138 Eichrodt, Ezekiel, 431. 139 See note 96. 46</page><page sequence="20">LEWIS: CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32: Lion-Dragon Myths stirred-up (muddied) waters" or among "the thrashing creatures (who muddy?) the waters."140 Tishpak's battle scene involved the storm language of bursting clouds and violent tempest which is common in most divine combat myths, including those of the Bible. The book of Ezekiel frequently uses storm imagery, in- cluding storm clouds and darkness (30:3, 18; 32:7; 34:12; 38:9, 16) as well as torrential rains and stormy winds (13:11, 13; 38:22) to describe Yahweh's judgment. In Ezek. 32:7-8 the image is one of darkening skies. Tish- pak's battle concludes with a reference to the dragon's blood flowing for three years and three months, day and night. Similarly, the death of Ezekiel's dragon (32:6) re- sults in a drenching bloodflow which is of such quantity that it fills, not only the watercourses, but also, according to a translator's gloss,141 the entire land up to the moun- tain (tops).'42 The Differences between CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32 In the past, scholars have been too eager to see the Marduk versus Tiamat myth in Ezekiel 32:2, based solely on the use of the net in 32:3.143 Even though I have doc- umented more than the one parallel of the net, proper comparative methodology cautions against drawing hasty conclusions about shared traditions. There are significant differences between the two traditions discussed above, not the least of which are Sitz im Leben, chronology, function, and literary Gattung. The Labbu myth in CT 13.33-34, according to Wig- germann, "does not treat cosmological questions." Tish- pak, whose preeminence is promoted through the tale, "plays his part as a city god and warrior and not as a rep- resentative of some cosmic force."144 Only later in Enuma 140 Reading dal-hu-ut rather than ri-hu-ut. See note 31, above. If this reading is correct, we would have the same root (DLu) in CT 13.33-34 (obverse, 23) as in Ezekiel 32:2 tidlah mayim beragleka wat-tirpos nahdr6tam. The notion of the dragon muddying the waters is also found elsewhere (cf. Job 41:23; PRU 2.3.3-7). 141 See note 80. 142 Wiggermann ("Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mug- hussu'" 128, n. 32) curiously remarks that the duration of the bleeding at the end of the myth is "mythologically useless." Rather, it underscores the immense proportions of the dragon, a detail central to the myth. 143 Cf. Zimmerli, Ezekiel, 2:159. 144 Wiggermann, "Tispak, His Seal, and the Dragon mus- hussu," 123-24. Elish does the plot found in this myth develop into a cos- mic battle which results in the foundation of the uni- verse.145 Although the divine combat myths against Egypt in Ezekiel 29 and 32 do not form the basis of cosmology either, it is for different reasons. While Yahweh battle myths are associated elsewhere with creation,146 we see here the commonly used historicization of epic material as it applied to Egypt, the traditional historical foe dating back to Exodus lore.147 In particular, the oracles against Egypt (Ezek. 29-32) are connected with a specific pha- raoh, Hophra, known for his challenge to Nebuchadrezzar (cf. Jer. 37:5). Ezekiel illustrates how Hophra's hubris, like that of the king of Tyre, proves his demise.148 Pha- raoh, a mighty warrior and hunter, was the "living lion ... slayer of his enemies."149 Yet here the tables are turned. The hunter becomes the hunted. The great "lion" and "dragon" becomes the victim. Ezekiel's portrayal of God's battle against Hophra was not written to underscore a Davidic ruler's claim to the throne, but the preeminence of Yahweh as sovereign God and divine warrior in contrast to all others, deities or mere human potentates like Hophra. The reason for the de- struction of Egypt, as the author repeatedly emphasizes using characteristic terminology, is so that all nations, including Egypt, may know "that Yahweh is the Lord."150 Ezekiel reflects primarily West Semitic traditions, yet we must not underestimate how his East Semitic setting may have colored his portrait. The juxtaposition of Ezek. 32:2-8 with CT 13.33-34 helps us understand the raw material and images which formed part of the cultural backdrop for Ezekiel. One need only look to the compos- ite images in Ezekiel's opening visions to recognize his dependency on motifs found in Mesopotamian art and literature. It is not too bold to suggest that his depiction of the combat myth in Ezekiel 32 also blended West and East Semitic imagery. 145 I am not suggesting by this remark that Enuma Elish is directly dependent on the Labbu myth. See Lambert, "Ninurta Mythology," 55-56. 146 Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, 1-61. 147 Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, 88ff. 148 Zimmerli, Ezekiel, 2:116. 149 Boadt, Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt, 130. 150 Boadt calls this "recognition formula" "the most decisive characteristic of Ezekiel's theology" (Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt, 170). See especially W. Zimmerli, Erkenntnis Gottes nach dem Buche Ezechiel, ATANT 27 (Zurich: Zwingli, 1954), 41- 119 [reprinted in Gottes Offenbarung, ThB 19 (Munich: Kaiser, 1963)].
