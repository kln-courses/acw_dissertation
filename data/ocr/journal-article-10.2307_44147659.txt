<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dr. LG Khan Memorial Prize ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN BUDDHIST THEISM: ANTHROPOCENTRIC-TELEOLOGICAL ISSUES Anand Singh The Buddhist ecology ponders over the moral and ethical world beyond humanity. It gives cognitive approach which cultivates a sense of belonging with the ecosphere. The pervasive technologically oriented culture had voluminous impact on ecology. The human world's moral universe starts a cosmo-centric string of thoughts in motion and man starts perceiving the entire cosmos as an intrinsic unit. The anthropocentric-teleological approach emphasizes that the ecological fabric should be sustained for growth and survival of human universe. The anthropocentric ethics is man centric which accepts that man is a moral agent with specific set of values. His activities related to nature assume moral significance when it is linked to human affairs. Etymological ly the word 'ideological' is derived from the Greek word 'telos' means purpose and it is consequential. It proposes that an action is right if it produces the good consequences and vice- versa. Here action and purpose are good or bad depending upon the service and quality of the consequences it brings about.1 The Buddhist moral ideas so»v the seeds of anthropocentric- teleological concerns. The Buddhist monks adhere to intimate relationship between biotic and abiotic species. They consider the destruction of natural resources as unethical and encourage sustenance of human existence through balance of eco-system. It accepts that creation of universe is due to material-immaterial unity. The Agganna Sūtta2 says, materially the first beings were the self-luminous and the immaterial dimensions were earth and its attributes. Earlier the people enjoyed the produce of the earth and flew through the skies, but when greed appeared in their minds the flavorsome, fragrant substance of the earth became coarser. Because of it the external environment deteriorated and the delicious edible earth surface completely disappeared. The legend cites that change is inherent in nature but man's moral decline accelerated this process. Man's necessities and pleasures have been the cause of great change in the universe and his destructive propensity is still greater. When people take advantage of their special relationship by misappropriating nature's wealth, using it for their own end rather than sustaining it for future, they break the covenant and are</page><page sequence="2">Ancient India 93 rebelling against nature. The privilege of ruling over the earth and animal is not a license to kill but utilize it altruistically. Buddha says that 'a physical act should be undertaken only after repeated reflections. The physical act which one wishes to do might lead to harm the self, and that might lead to harm others, and would further lead to harm of both; this physical act is unskilled and it yields a feeling of anguish.'3 It means that what is advantageous to human beings should not be disproportionate and be disadvantageous to others. The relation between man and nature should be based on Wide range of interest- present and future, human and non-human. It tends to be purposeful, futuristic and everlasting. The primary needs of fresh air, water and food would be ever- existing and it demands commitment from human civilization to preserve and sustain it for future. This bond of ecological friendship could be realized through the right set of values. The values of interdependence led to the. evolution of an environmental ethics as mentioned in the doctrine of Pratityasamutpada.4 The doctrine of 'dependent origination' reveals our true place in the universe and shows the value to expound it. This doctrine has been propounded against the theory of wholesale determinism which was perplexing the society at the time of the Buddha. He discarded the niyativäda of Gośala Maskariputra5 who preached extreme determinism denying all free will and all moral responsibilities. He denied all moral duties and said that everything depends on fate, environment and nature. Buddha not only stigmatized Gośala but condemned his ideas as most pernicious.6 The theory of causation says that the essential conditions of human and sub-human life is fraught with misery. It propounds ' asmin sati idam bhavati' (this being that appears) means that under particular circumstances the result appears, with a change of condition there is a change in the result.7 At other stage it is said that there is no real production, there is only interdependence.8 It means when causation operates on a resource, an encouragement (atisaya-ãdhanã) produces an outgrowth and a new whole is produced. Between the two sources there is a bridge, the fact of inherence ( samvãya ) a link which again is a separate identity. Every cause of causation is not only causation of oneself but also of another self ( parata-utpādah ).9 It shows that our bodies are not the fundamental source of our problems and our desire is not free from its physical, spatial and temporal actions. The right and wrong are intrinsic properties of human conduct. It should be weighed with its positive consequences. Man has special capabilities consisting of self-consciousness and self-determination by which one is treated as above the physical nature. His rational spirit enthuses him</page><page sequence="3">94 IHC : Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 to know the cause of ecological preservation. The biotic entities like forests, rivers, hills, sunshine, sunset not only fulfills the human needs but also provides vital breath and kindles an aesthetic delight. The pattern oPeco-ethics should have universal applicability and mutual respect. These ethical statements will be evaluative and axiological in nature reflecting analysis of value preferences, behavioral norms and code of conduct in a specific spatio-temporal context. Buddha says that every movement is the product of the totality of its antecedents. The thing never produces anything alone. It is followed by a result only if it is combined by other elements known as co-factors (samskāra ) Nothing single comes from single From totality every thing arises. 10 There is no destruction of one thing and no destruction of another thing, no influence of one substance on other, no anthropomorphic mutual help between the causes. It produces a constant uninterrupted infinitely graduated change by human co-operation. 11 It is known as anthropomorphic result (puruśkara phalam). All these co-operating causes are convergent stream of moments and known as creeping causes ( upasarpana - pratyaya). At their meeting point (sahakãri-melana) a new series starts when the soil moisture, heat and seed series of moment .unite them, last moments are followed by first moment of the sprout. So Buddhist causality is many in one relation and known as 'one result production theory' ( eka-kãrya-kãrita ).12 Buddha's cause-effect theory indicates that eco-ethics independent of man is not possible though it is dealt with natural and scientific perspective. The un-prudent and wanton destruction of natural resources may shatter one's self-control and provide involuntary addiction and altered state of consciousness which may upset or even destroy eco-system. It is not fear of perishing but to live and survive calmly which has fuelled sustained human endeavour and exploration for healthy eco-system. The universe is accepted as seamless undivided unit. Only delusion causes it to appear fragmented into infinite number of separate pieces. The causation theory gives wisdom to discover the cause and put the universe back together again. Man's unique character to manipulate nature and accumulate experience enabled him to break through the barriers of temperature, aridity, seas, and mountains that have always restricted other species to specific habitats within a limited range. With the cultural devices of fire, clothing, shelter and tools he was able to do what no other organism could do without changing the original character. When culture change was first time substituted for biological evolution, man started acquiring</page><page sequence="4">Ancient India 95 new habitat in a widening range that eventually came to include the whole earth. Through the change and modification the humans have brought about changes in plant cover, soil structure, influenced climate, affected geomorphic processes and have been instrumental in changing the quality and quantity of water. The forest is cleared to allow agriculture, to provide fuel for domestic purposes and wood for construction. The environment simplified by humans may be inherently unstable and prone to disaster. The unplanned actions can lead to side effects and consequences may be disadvantageous to humans. The healing process starts with putting our own life into order. When it does not happen the eco-system starts deteriorating and culminating into destruction of universe. The Anguttar Nikãya 13 tells the story of Mount Sineru rooted in the great ocean at a depth of 84000 leagues and rises above the sea level to another great height of 84000 leagues. Sineru was a classical symbol of stability and steadfastness. It was destroyed by heat without leaving even ashes at a time when multiple Suns appeared in the sky. It shows that nothing including eco-system is unconditional and existence of everything depends on some conditions. The Tevigga Sūtta'4 compares the cause to a staircase on mounting which one can look around the world and judge it with the vision of Buddha. The Mahā Nidāna SūttaiS says that who fails to grasp this stand point invites trouble. The bad and wicked state of things arises from indulgence over possessions, blows and wounds, of quarrelling and strife, contradictions, resentments, etc. Buddha in his dharmachakrapravartana at Sārnāth preached ChattãrJariya sachchã.16 The sammäditthi (right view) 17 explores that ignorance with its results namely wrong views ( mithyãditthi ) about the self and the world is the root cause of suffering. The first stage of moral reformation shall be acquisition of knowledge of truth. The right view is not a theological speculation regarding nature. The actual realization leads to development of feeling of compassion towards innumerable and infinite kind of life. It is known as mind of boundless compassion {metta appamabbá). With the compassionate mind one also learns the love and kindness {metta cetovimutti). By it the feeling of self preservation and self love is transformed into love and kindness for nature. The Dhammapada 18 says all men tremble at punishment, all men fear death, compare yourself with others and do not kill or cause harm. It further says a fool does not know when he commits wrong doings and the wicked is punished by his own deeds as one burnt by fire.19 The compassionate person who maintains tranquility, sobriety, chastity and has ceased to find faults with others is indeed a monk.20 Buddha opines that a good Buddhist is expected to be full of</page><page sequence="5">96 ¡HC: Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 compassion (karūnadhimutta) 21 He used to look upon the whole world to help the needy people.22 The principles of metta , karuna , upeksha and mudita are described for protection, preservation and sustainable view towards all creatures of the Universe ( sabbaapana bhuta hitanukampa)P Buddha asks everyone to cultivate a boundless mind. When a man gives, Ms merit will increase, No enmity can grow in the self restrained The skilled shun evil : they attain nirvāna By ending greed, hatred and delusion. 24 A helping attitude and an unobstructed mind without hatred and enemity can provide best service to the world.25 The sammā sankappa (right resolve)26 expresses that mere knowledge of truth would be futile unless one resolves to resusticate his life in this direction. In ecological perspective the aspirant is desired to give up his lust towards nature and desist from doing any harm to them. The Sammā sati (right mindfulness)27 necessitates the constant vigilance and lays down that one should constantly bear in mind the things he has already learnt. Sustainable development should not be hampered but it should not cause ecological imbalance. The Dhammapada 28 says Mind precedes all things . Mind is supreme produced by mind are they. If one should speak an act with mind defiled, Suffering will follow. Just as wheel follows hoof of the drawing ox. Mind precedes all things Mind is supreme produced by mind are they If one should speak or act with benign mind Well- being will follow Like a never parting shadow. The right mindfulness encourages magnanimous approach towards nature and avoids animosity and vicarious attitude. It may create awareness about distribution of materials worldwide by atmospheric and oceanic circulation and problems like depletion of earth's ozone shield, acid rain, polluted ground water, lakes, rivers and ocean etc., would be automatically resolved. Living organisms exists in a network of interaction with other population. These are subtle and complex and may be based on food relationship. If the population consists of only a few scattered individuals, competition will not be a factor of ecological importance. But where the population is ever-growing number of sub-factors like the analysis of the population structure, population growth patterns, the natural control of the population and the interaction between</page><page sequence="6">Ancient India 97 populations of man, animal and other organisms can be studied. Man obviously wants to limit or reduce the population of organism where as he has to maximize within reasonable limits valuable and productive animals for aesthetic or economic reasons. The greatest scientific and philosophical challenge to human endeavor is understanding and regulation of human population . The Sammā ājiva (right livelihood)29 recommends livelihood by honest means and avoids forbidden ways. The Samanna phala Sūtta 30 says that the monks by abstaining from killing of living beings and keeping aloof from destruction of life, reside in compassion. They should be kind to all creatures that have life, non- violence should be practiced with compassion ( daya ), mercy ( hitanukampa ) and shyness (lai i a). These practices denounced cruelty and injury to life and also result in happiness to one who follows it.31 The people who do not harm anybody and who controlled their desires are enlightened ones. They are free from all types of sufferings.32 The followers of Gotama are aware of this feeling and their mind is always delighted with compassion.33 Buddha preached moderation in life and deed. The person should be mirrored as controlled in deed and words, restrained in food ( kayagutto,vacigutto,ahare dare yato ).34 The Putta Majra Sūtta 35 says that food ( kabalavkara ahara) should be partaken not to relish ( davya ), not for indulgence ( madaya ), not for personal charm (mandanya) but for the survival of the human body. Buddha admitted that food is the prerequisite of existence and survival but it is also a source of temptation and lust which transforms into craving. A person should avoid taking food for pleasure and should stick to moderation in life. When one abandons his desire and covetousness for rich food, he stands satisfied and unperturbed.36 Buddha expounded to upãsakas and npāsikas to adhere to norms of non-killing of beings.37 He criticized the persons who support and promote violence.38 He says that not only the fauna but the flora of the surroundings should be protected and preserved. Man's sentiment is not only limited to mankind but it covers all the sentient beings.39 The enlightened one not only protects seed life but also plant life ( bijagama , bhutagama).40 He was against the destruction of plant life.41 Even the injury to creatures, being cruel and violent, causing injury without mercy on living beings has ill effect on life span of human kind.42 When a man commits injury to a life , his karma leads him in very unhappy state for a long time. And in the next birth he will be born in a lower strata of society. If born again as a man, he may be infirm, full of grief, isolated from well-wishers and unable to live a full life.43 Mankind lives in the world of mutual injury where life can be sustained by marginalizing others. It is wrong to be unkind to animals not because</page><page sequence="7">98 IHC: Proceedings, 70th Session, 2009-10 they are mortal beings but because they suffer and needless suffering should be avoided. But if everyone has equal rights the people would be prohibited from killing the deadly bacteria or insects infecting the human life. The biotic component of the environment is responsible for pathogenic organism like virus, bacteria, protozoa, poisonous and allergy causing plants, etc. There would be nutritional disorders owing to the failure to utilize food resources properly and correctly. So the various kinds of insects are regularly eliminated in order to minimize the health hazards carried by them. Buddhism permits restrained killings for the benefit of the society. The skin of sheep, goat and deer can be used as coverlets and other purposes in the frontier states.44 Even Buddha did not rule out the eating of meat. In three conditions meat should not be taken by the monk if he has (i) seen (ii) heard and (iii) suspected that the animal was intentionally killed for him. This rule is is known as tikotiparisuddha.45 The use of raw flesh is not allowed.46 But in case of illness raw meat and blood could be used as a medicine.47 The flesh of ten species eg. man, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, hyena are forbidden.48 Buddhism also glorifies war and the attributes of kshatriyas are highly praised. The monks are advised to be a crusader to wage the battle of supremacy in the spiritual field.49 The Bodhisattavas are depicted as kings and in certain cases they may destroy life to uphold the moral order.50 But the futile killings and violence are highly condemned. Buddha openly ridiculed the vedic sacrifices in which thousands of animals were killed. These sacrifices are absurd and fruitless.51 The Sakka-P anha-Sūtta 52 says that sacrifices are both spiritually and economically wrong. It is like seeds which are sown in barren condition without any rain and tilling and no crop would be produced. Even certain professionals like butcher, fowler, hunter, fisherman, bandit, executioner and jailer are seen with contempt and disgrace.53 A butcher because of his killing spree and violent deeds suffers for thousand years in purgatory.54 If natural laws are not going to be followed, the forest would disappear from mountain spurs and ridges, the agrarian field would be washed away and the land would be wasted and remain unproductive, so one should not commit evil, and practice all good and have a kind heart.55 It shows that ecological adaptation should be a process of advantageous variation and progressive modification by which the human beings are adjusted to the condition of the environment to live a harmonious life.
