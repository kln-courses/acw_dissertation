<plain_text><page sequence="1">ILANA PARDES The Biography of Ancient Israel: Imagining the Birth of a Nation T HE IMAGININGS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL begin in Genesis. In one of this book's most memorable visions, God leads Abraham outdoors and says: "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them. .. So shall thy seed be" (15:5).1 To envision an abstract concept such as nation requires poetic power, a metaphoric leap that would make the transition from one into a multitude more comprehensible. The sight of stars in the sky is construed as a key to understanding the future of Abraham's descendants. But then much remains unknown. The metaphor does not solve the riddle of the nation to be, but rather opens it through a broadening of horizons. God challenges Abraham to count the stars only to prove that it is an impossible task, for the stars reveal themselves to be unfathomable and infi- nite. The stars, however, are but a preliminary guiding metaphor. The central metaphor for the nation throughout the Bible turns out to be less promising and less heavenly: it lies in the human sphere. The nation is predominantly imagined as a person, and as such is destined to endure the flawed and tumultuous life of mere mortals. The relevance of metaphor to the construction of nations has been raised by Benedict Anderson, who introduced the compel- ling idea of the nation as an imagined community. A nation is nec- essarily imagined, he claims, since it consists of numerous mem- bers who do not know each other yet share "the image of their communion" (6). Anderson is particularly intrigued by the capac- ity of national narratives to create a sense of unity and continuity at points of clear disjunction. In the rich, though brief, conclud- ing section of Imagined Communities, he argues that nations, much like individuals, generate biographies. Births of nations are not as ' All quotations from the Bible are from the KingJames Version.</page><page sequence="2">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL / 25 easily identified, not to mention deaths, but the two modes of bio- graphical narrative have much in common. Above all, they both attempt to smooth out the fragmentary and slippery character of memory as they fashion a coherent line of development, a concep- tion of identity. Anderson refers to modern nations, but his observations are il- luminating with respect to ancient Israel as well. The Pentateuch provides intriguing and complex material for studying the fash- ioning of national biographies. The nation, according to this tra- dition, was conceived in the days of Abraham; was miraculously born with the Exodus, the parting of the Red Sea; then spent a long period of childhood and restless adolescence in the wilder- ness, and finally approached adulthood with the conquest of Canaan. Anderson, like most recent scholars of nationhood, regards the nation as a modern phenomenon, dating back to the time of the Enlightenment. He rightly emphasizes the historicity of the nation in his critique of previous perceptions of national identity as natu- ral and universal. Yet by limiting the scope of the much-needed historical consideration of the phenomenon, he overlooks fasci- nating manifestations of the fashioning of national identities in earlier periods.2 To be sure, one cannot speak of nationalism or sovereignty with respect to ancient Israel; nevertheless, the ques- tions that Anderson has introduced to the study of nationhood- How are nations imagined? How is a sense of national belonging created? Why are national narratives so powerful?-are most rel- evant to the shaping of the history of biblical Israel. I do not mean to suggest that national narratives are common in the ancient world. Israel's preoccupation with its reason for being is exceptional in the ancient Near East. No Near Eastern ana- logues to a national literature like the Bible have been found.3 In Greek and particularly in Roman literary tradition, however, the situation is different; narratives concerning national origins are just as important. Eric Gruen provides an insightful analysis of the formation of Roman national identity against the background of Greek culture, examining such key cultural developments as the choice to adopt the legend of Troy as a legend of origin. "It en- abled Rome to associate itself with the rich and complex fabric of Hellenic tradition. . . But at the same time, it also announced Rome's distinctiveness from that world" (31). Israel's story bears a resemblance to the Roman one. It too involves a divine promise, individuation from a major civilization, a quest for lost roots, a 2 For a similar critique, see the introduction by Carla Hesse and Thomas Laquer to Representations 47 (1994): 1-12.

In the Aeneid, by way of comparison, the plot revolves round Aeneas. The wanderings between Troy and the promised new land are pri- marily Aeneas's wanderings: the people remain a rather pale foil. They engage in no conflict-whether with Aeneas or the gods- that would grant them access to the central stage. The biblical text is significantly different in its rendering of national drama. Is- rael-especially in Exodus and Numbers, where the primary ques- tions about the origin and singularity of the nation are raised-is a character, a protagonist, whose moves and struggles determine the plot. The nation has a voice (represented at times in a singular mode); it moans and groans, cries, is euphoric at times, complains frequently, and rebels against Moses and God time and again. What is more, Israel is gendered. The term 'am (nation, people) is masculine singular, and the nation's designations are shaped ac- cordingly. In the Pentateuch, the nation is represented as a male character, as God's firstborn son (beni bechori Yisrael, Exod. 4:22).5 The priority given to Israel over other nations represents a rever- sal, in national terms, of the primogeniture law-a tradition cen- tral in the lives of the founding fathers. The late-born nation that came "to the stage after all its neighbors had assumed their histori- cal roles" (Greenberg, Understanding 12) is elevated by God to the position of the firstborn. Israel is indeed a chosen nation, God's nation, but the reason for its chosenness remains obscure. It never succeeds in develop- ing into an exemplary nation with high moral and religious stan- dards.6 The mature Israel is not superior to the young nation in its formative years, which is whyJeremiah can nostalgically recall the passionate "kindness" (hesed) of Israel in its youth. Just as indi- vidual characters in biblical narrative are far from sainthood, so the representation of the nation, following the same poetic prin- ciples, refrains from an idealization of national history. This figuring of Israel as a character is a forceful unifying strat- 4 Moshe Weinfeld provides a fascinating comparison between the Bible and The Aeneid (1-21). 5 This is an interesting monotheistic revision of the divine lineage attributed to heroes in polytheistic traditions. No biblical hero could be defined as God's son (that would make God far too anthropomorphic), but the nation may acquire such a status precisely because it is more clearly a metaphoric affiliation. Here too a comparison with Roman myths may be illuminating. Rome's sacred origin is as- sured through the divine blood of its founding fathers: Aeneas, as one recalls, is Venus's son, and Romulus and Remus are the offspring of Mars. 6 See Regina Schwartz's insightful analysis in "Nations and Nationalism" of the question of progress (or lack of) in biblical historiography.</page><page sequence="4">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL / 27 egy, but the metaphor does not provide what Anderson calls "unisonance." In this connection, Ijoin Homi Bhabha and others who have criticized Anderson for his emphasis on homogeneity and coherence in the formation of imagined communities. The biblical vox populi is divided, diverse, and fragmented; and accord- ingly national historiography is neither linear nor monolithic; it reveals points of tension between different traditions regarding the nation's biography and character. Indeed, even the nation's sexual identity is not stable. The prophets, more often than not, represent Israel as female, using 'Jerusalem" (a feminine noun) as an alternative national designation. The nation is far too complex a phenomenon to be captured by a single representational mode. Finally, I would like to emphasize that the personification of the nation does not preclude the historicity of the narrative. Amos Funkenstein observes that Israel is one of the few ancient nations that perceived its beginning in historical time rather than in a mythical "in illo tempore" (51). Even when mythical motifs are clearly present, they are inextricably connected with a historio- graphical drive to record meaningful past events. In the Bible, his- tory and literature go hand in hand more explicitly than in mod- ern historiography, which is why Israel serves as a paradigmatic case for examining the narrative base of national constructions.7 THE POLITICS OF BIRTH The focus here will be on the moment of birth in the biography of ancient Israel as it is shaped in the opening chapters of Exodus. Representing the birth of a nation is not a simple task. Let me suggest that in this case the personification of the nation is facili- tated by the interweaving of two biographies: the story of the birth of Moses and that of Israel. Put differently, the opening chapters of Exodus offer an application of the myth of the birth of the hero on a national level via the juxtaposition of the histories of Moses and the nation. What characterizes the birth of a hero? Otto Rank offers an in- sightful psychoanalytic analysis of the issue in The Myth of the Birth of the Hero. According to Rank, there are recurrent motifs in heroic birth stories. To begin with, the conception of the hero is impeded by difficulties such as abstinence or prolonged barrenness. During or before the pregnancy there is a prophecy, or an oracle caution- ing the father against the hero's birth. The father then tries to shape a different future by giving orders to kill the new-born son. However, the baby is instead placed in a basket or box and deliv- ered to the waves; whereupon, against all odds, the hero is saved by animals, or by lowly people, and is suckled by a female animal 7 For more on the intricate interrelations of literature and history of biblical narrative, see David Damrosch's cogent discussion in Narrative Covenant.</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 28 or by a humble woman. When full-grown, the hero discovers his royal parents, takes revenge on his father, and, recognized by his people, he finally achieves rank and honors (65). Following Freud, Rank reads the myth as an expression of Oedi- pal struggles between fathers and sons. The hero is he who is ca- pable of standing against his father and overcoming him. The myth traces this struggle "back to the very dawn of the hero's life, by having him born against his father's will and saved in spite of his father's evil intentions" (Freud 9). What we have here in Freudian terms is a "family romance," the kind of story a child fab- ricates when feeling deserted. Resentful of his parents' neglect (opportunities arise only too often), the child thinks of himself as a foundling, an adopted child, whose true parents-royal, need- less to say-will eventually be revealed. Moses' birth story is one of Rank's examples. In many ways, the story is indeed compatible with Rank's model: a threatened child, the exposure in the basket, the miraculous deliverance of the foundling, the two sets of parents, and the final acknowledgement of the hero's power. But there is a significant difference, which Rank smoothes over by claiming that the original story was dis- torted by biblical scribes: Moses' true parents are not the royal ones but rather the poor Hebrew slaves. What Rank fails to see-as does Freud in Moses and Monotheism- is that at this moment of national birth the inversion of the two sets of parents is purposeful. Moses' "true" parents are higher in rank despite their lowly position precisely because they are mem- bers of the chosen nation-to-be. Moving to the national realm, God's promise to Abraham under the stars is an annunciation scene that foretells the birth of the nation (as it foretells the birth of Isaac). The promise is reaffirmed later when God reveals the future of the nation to Isaac and Jacob, but one needs to wait until the opening chapter of Exodus to wit- ness the full realization of God's words. At this dramatic point the children of Israel multiply at an un- canny pace and become a nation: the nation of the children of Israel ('am bney yisrael). Interestingly, the term is first used by Pha- raoh. Pharaoh's anxieties enable him to perceive the birth of Is- rael long before the Hebrews themselves can. Their uncanny growth intimidates Pharaoh, who, having already afflicted and op- pressed them to no avail, is determined to "expose" all the Hebrew male babes. Much has been written about the curious choice to get rid of the male babes alone (females are spared), but with no con- sideration given to the mythical background.8 What we have here is an adaptation of the myth of the birth of a hero on a national 8 Dorothy Zeligs provides a similar observation in Moses: A Psychodynamic Study.</page><page sequence="6">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL/ 29 level. Pharaoh, the ruler of the parent-nation, fears the power of a budding nation of rivals growing within Egypt. Parental anxi- eties-What will come out of the teeming womb?-thus conflate with racist anxieties-Will the Others overbear? Shiphrah and Puah, the two midwives who are ordered to kill all the Hebrew male babes, are the national correlate of Moses' fe- male deliverers in Exodus 2. Here too a curious detail in the text- the fact that two midwives are considered sufficient for a national massacre-can be explained in terms of the mythical context and the interrelations of the two biographies. The midwives, much like the humble rescuers of heroes, choose to violate the king's decree and save the threatened newborns. They trick Pharaoh by telling him midwives' tales: "And the king of Egypt called for the mid- wives, and said unto them, 'Why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive?' And the midwives said unto Pha- raoh, 'Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them'" (1:18-19). Shiphrah and Puah outwit Pharaoh by con- firming his racist anxieties concerning the proliferation of the He- brew slaves. Relying on a common racist notion, that the Other is closer to Nature, they claim that Hebrew women need no mid- wives, for unlike Egyptian women they are animal-like and can give birth without professional help. Pharaoh is ridiculed and the He- brews continue to multiply. So far I have focused on the mythical qualities in the representa- tion of the nation's birth, but one needs to bear in mind the ways in which myth is used here to depict the concrete horrors of slavery. Michael Walzer offers a cogent reading of the Egyptian oppression in his meditation on the political meanings of the Exodus. He defines the enslavement in Egypt as a form of cruel tyranny, exercised from the seat of political power, that insisted not only on making a profit through corv6e, but also on crushing the slaves' spirits, on embittering their lives with rigorous, humili- ating work. Indeed the Hebrews could not at first listen to Moses' revolutionary ideas "for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage" (Exod. 6:9). The Hebrew is kotser ruach, literally "shortness of spirit," an idiom for impatience, but in this context it acquires, Walzer claims, the additional meaning of "dispiritedness" (47). What needs to be added to Walzer's analysis is a consideration of the ways in which bondage distorts and undermines the process of reproduction. The phenomenon is all too well known from testi- monies regarding other instances of slavery. Las Casas depicts the impact of New World slavery in this connection: Thus husbands and wives were together once every eight or ten months, and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides that they had no mind for marital intercourse, and in this way they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 30 no milk to nurse them with, and for this reason, while I was in Cuba, 7000 children died in three months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer des- peration. (Historia 11, 13)9 The great spokesman against North American slavery, Frederick Douglass, captures the dehumanization involved from the mo- ment of birth even when a newborn slave does manage to survive. He begins his renowned Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave with a comment on his birth. I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. (833) To reclaim birth is thus a revolutionary act in the context of sla- very. It discloses hope for the newborn and the power to imagine a different future, one without bondage and tyranny; it means to reclaim subjecthood, to turn the birth of the oppressed into a meaningful event that needs to be recorded and narrated. The story of the birth of ancient Israel is a story of trauma and recovery. The founding trauma in the nation's biography is bond- age, the repression of growth. But then a process of recovery be- gins that entails the inversion of exposure from an anti-natal act to a means of rescue. Yocheved casts her son into the Nile, but Moses' exposure is not meant to comply with Pharaoh's decree but rather to undo it. Similarly, the nation multiplies despite Pharaoh's tortuous measures and tireless attempts to restrict its growth: "But the more they afflicted them, the more they multi- plied and grew" (Exod. 1:12). The relation between affliction and growth is provocatively inverted. While Pharaoh expects a reduc- tion in birth rate, his harsh treatment of the Hebrews only leads to the opposite, to a mysterious increase. Recovery entails a curious combination of resistance and revenge. REVENGE Birth and revenge-or rather revenge fantasies-go hand in hand in Rank's analysis of heroic birth myths. The father who tries to prevent the birth of the hero is overthrown or killed. A similar phenomenon can be traced in Exodus. Pharaoh, the anti-natal force with respect to both Moses and the nation, is defeated, at first by the ongoing multiplication of the Hebrews and then in a direct confrontation: the ten plagues. Early commentators have noted the gradual escalation of severity in the plagues, beginning with nuisances and pests, passing through destruction of livestock 9 Quoted in Todorov's The Conquest of America. The Midrash provides a similar story regarding Amram and Yocheved. Amram, according to Shemot Rabbah, re- fused to have sexual relations with Yocheved due to Pharaoh's decree.</page><page sequence="8">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL/ 31 and crops, and ending with the gravest of them all-the death of human beings. This final plague seems to represent the final push in Israel's delivery. It is the night of Passover. Pharaoh, who has refused to set the Israelites free, suffers from a symmetrical punishment. The Egyptian firstborn die while God's firstborn, Israel, is saved. The differentiation between the Egyptians and the Hebrews is now marked by blood. God demands that the children of Israel take the blood of the Paschal sacrifice and "strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses" so that it may serve as "a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt" (Exod. 12:7-13). The blood that marks the Israelites is not only apotropaic. Its location on the two side posts of the door evokes natal imagery (Nohrnberg 46). The Israelites are delivered collectively out of the womb of Egypt. National birth, much like individual births (and all the more so in ancient times), takes place on a delicate border between life and death. It involves the transformation of blood from a signifier of death to a signifier of life. It also involves the successful opening of the womb, the prevention of the womb's turning into a tomb. The term "opener of the womb" (peter rechem) is introduced in Exodus 13:2 as a synonym for "firstborn." It ap- pears in the depiction of the law regarding the firstborn, a law that is construed as a commemoration of the last plague: "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 'Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."' Although the term is not used explicitly with respect to the nation as a whole, this is precisely what is at stake in the context of the Exodus. The first opening of the womb (an act that is in a sense analogous to deflowering) is a unique and dangerous occurrence that requires divine vigilance. Those who do not deserve divine protection-namely the Egyp- tians-find their death in the process, but Israel, God's firstborn, is consecrated as it opens the matrix. Then comes the climactic moment of the delivery, which in- cludes the ultimate revenge: the scene at the Red Sea. Moses parts the waters at God's command. The Israelites walk upon land in the midst of the sea while the Egyptian soldiers, who are pursuing them, drown as the waters return. The downfall of the parent na- tion seems total. Pharaoh, who had wished to cast the Hebrew chil- dren into the Nile, now finds his soldiers and chariots sinking "like a stone" in the waters of the Red Sea. "Did not old Pharaoh get lost, get lost, get lost in the Red Sea" asks a famous African-American slave song. Lawrence Levine aptly argues that the song promises that "power relations [are] not im-</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 32 mutable" and conveys confidence in "the possibilities of instanta- neous change" (40). Even if the scene by the Red Sea is only a slave fantasy-there is no evidence in Egyptian sources regarding such a defeat, nor did the great Egypt disappear from the map at this time-the importance of the moment lies in its carnivalesque spirit, in the reversal of hierarchies. The king falls and the op- pressed spring to life. From now on, time will be perceived differently. Everything will be measured in relation to the moment in which God delivered Israel from Egypt. "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" (Exod. 12:2). A new calendar is established with the birth of the nation as its point of reference. It is a revolutionary moment that marks a won- drous new beginning (Benjamin 261). Slavery is left behind and the intoxicating smell of freedom is in the air. WONDER God performs a variety of wonders in Egypt (the ten plagues are perceived as such), but the parting of the Red Sea seems to surpass them all. It marks the nation's first breath-out in the open air- and serves as a distinct reminder of the miraculous character of birth. Where there was nothing, a living creature emerges all of a sudden. Much like Moses, the nation is drawn out of the water against all odds. If the myth of the birth of the hero accentuates the wonder of birth on an individual level, here the miracle is col- lective and intensified: a wonder on a grand scale. The two enor- mous walls of water-the ultimate breaking of the waters-and the exciting appearance of dry land seem to represent a gigantic birth, a birth that only a divine hand could have brought about, a birth that is analogous to the creation of the world. The parting of the waters evokes Genesis 1, and the "blast" of God's "nostrils" on the waters (Exod. 15:8) calls to mind the creation of Adam in Genesis 2:7: "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." Accordingly, God is referred to as the "maker" of the nation ('am zu kanita), a term that otherwise is used only in the context of the creation (Exod. 15:16). On witnessing this great wonder, the people as a whole burst out singing. The women, led by Miriam, take part in the celebration, looming large with their dancing and music, adding a feminine touch to this moment of birth. The Song of the Sea, with its fast tempo, celebrates the singularity of the nation's miraculous deliv- ery: "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? ... For the horse of Pharaoh went in his chariots and with his horse- men into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea</page><page sequence="10">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL / 33 upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea" (15:11-19). It is at once a breathtaking and breathgiving moment. All doubts and fears dissolve. Everything seems possible. Crossing the Red Sea is a leap of faith, a leap into life. Martin Buber offers an insightful description of "The Wonder on the Sea" in Moses. He defines it as a moment of "abiding aston- ishment" that "no knowledge, no cognition, can weaken." The great turning points in religious history are based on the fact that again and ever again an individual and a group. .. wonder and keep on wondering, at a natural phenomenon, a historical event, or at both together. .. Miracle is not something supernatural or superhistorical, but an incident, an event which can be fully included in the objective, scientific nexus of nature and history, the vital meaning of which, however, for the person to whom it occurs, destroys the secu- rity of knowledge for him and explodes the fixity of the fields of experience named Nature and History. (75-6) The birth of the nation involves a bewildering mixture of nature and history. Nature participates in the shaping of this grand his- torical event: the Song of the Sea is the Song of the Birth of the Nation. The sudden break in the rhythm of natural phenomena is used here to express the intense excitement of a nascent people. The wonder on the sea, however, not only "explodes the fixity" of the boundary between nature and history, but it also blurs tem- poral demarcations. It offers an astonishing condensation of time, or, in Robert Alter's terms, creates an "illusion of simultaneity" (54). The Song of the Sea moves swiftly from the deliverance by the sea to the future of Israel as a mature nation in Canaan. Bibli- cal scholars have often regarded the reference to the conquest of Canaan and the construction of the temple in Jerusalem in the final lines of the Song of the Sea as an anachronistic element slop- pily added at a later stage. What they fail to see is the extent to which the nation's future is part and parcel of the hope that opened up with the parting of the waters. The nation's miraculous birth makes it possible to imagine the maturation of Israel. Just as God "devastated the Egyptians, made them sink like a stone in the watery deep, His mighty presence makes the hostile nations of Canaan turn to stone with fear while he guides His people in and firmly founds his sanctuary far above the engulfing flood" (Alter 54). The initial miracle is seen as a sign for miracles to come. IN THYBLOOD LIVE In his explicit and rather graphic use of the metaphor of birth vis-1-vis the nation, Ezekiel sheds much light on the representa- tion of national formation in Exodus. In a famous passage in Ezekiel 16, which relates the story of national birth, Jerusalem stands for the nation: And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 34 thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee; to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live. I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare. Now when I passed by thee and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy naked- ness. (16:4-8) Israel was ruthlessly deserted by its parents at birth, left helpless, soaking in blood, and without even elementary postpartum care. The horrifying aspects of parental neglect are depicted in vivid detail. The newborn was not washed, her navel cord was not cut, her body was not salted (a practice that was perceived as essential for the newborn's skin), nor was she clothed. But then God passed by and adopted the neglected nation, adjuring Israel to live in her blood and to regard the marks of blood on her body as a source of life. What is more, God raised the nation and enabled its fruitful- ness and growth. He not only provided care and compassion but also furnished "excellent ornaments." Being a foundling nation is a traumatic experience, but ultimately it turns out to be beneficial: it leads (as is the case in the myth of the birth of the hero) to the discovery of/by more distinguished parents and ensures the tran- sition from rags to riches, or rather from nakedness to royal gar- ments. The story of the Exodus is indeed the story of Israel's rescue and adoption by a more distinguished father-who is not merely royal but divine. It is a father who has the force to wash off the signs of a collective trauma, to turn a helpless late-born nation into a power- ful chosen one. In Ezekiel the adoption is construed as a marital bond between God and the nation, while in Exodus it entails the bond between a father and his firstborn son. In both cases the chosenness of Israel is defined in familial terms. The variation in the representation of the nation's gender allows for a multifaceted treatment of the complex relation of Israel and God. Suffice it to say within the limited scope of this paper that whereas the repre- sentation of the nation as female introduces an erotic aspect in the relationship of God and the nation (a monotheistic compensation of sorts for the Mesopotamian sacred marriage; see Fisch 148-49 and Pardes 122-26), the father-son dyad is far more concerned with the question of male heroism and its relevance to the con- struction of national heroism-a question I will address later on in greater detail. Interestingly, Ezekiel provides a different account not only of Israel's gender, but also of its place of birth and primary lineage. "Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan," he claims,</page><page sequence="12">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL / 35 "thy father was an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite." Ezekiel re- gards the Amorites and Hittites (closely connected with the Canaanites according to biblical ethnography; see Greenberg, Ezekiel 237) as parent-nations because he is interested in raising a more immediate concern-Israel's distinctiveness (or lack thereof) vis-a'-vis the neighboring nations of Canaan.'o The biogra- phy shaped in the Pentateuch may be the dominant one, but it is not the only one available." Such multiplicity points to the diffi- culties involved in shaping a national biography. National origins are far from clear cut (although this is also true for individual bi- ographies, if to a lesser degree), and their representation is sus- ceptible to change in light of changing circumstances. THE QUESTION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY Even within Exodus itself, on closer scrutiny, the question of the nation's origins is a complex one. Nations may try to fashion a co- herent conception of identity, as Anderson claims, but they are bound to fail. The intertwined biographies of Moses and Israel dis- close the problematic of defining identity both for the individual and the community. Moses' birth story differs from his heroic counterparts at another point as well. He is transferred back and forth between his Hebrew and Egyptian mothers. Yocheved places him in a basket at the Nile, where he is found by Pharaoh's daugh- ter who then hands him back to Yocheved (believing her to be a wet nurse). Later Moses is brought back to the palace, where the princess adopts him and endows him with a name. He is raised in the palace, but ultimately returns to his family and people. The very fact that there are two sets of parents in the myth of the birth of the hero already intimates the difficulties involved in fash- ioning an identity. The myth addresses primary questions: Who am I? Who are my parents? Where do I come from? But the ques- tions of origin become all the more complex when the two sets of parents belong to two different nations. Moses' split national iden- tity at birth will follow him for the rest of his life, so much so that he will die in the wilderness, between Egypt and the Promised Land. And the nation? Here too the multiple parental figures (and Israel's biography is far more complicated in this respect than Moses' family tree) point to diverse national origins. The conflict between God and Pharaoh is but one expression of the issue. The 10 Note, however, that the Exodus tradition hovers in the background of Ezekiel's national biography. In his reading of this passage, Moshe Greenberg (Ezekiel) suggests that God's second passing by takes place in Egypt. 11 Another case in point is Chronicles. Sarah Japhet argues persuasively that for the Chronicler, Israel (that is, Judah) originated in Palestine and resided there until the Babylonian Exile, which is why the Exodus, the wanderings in the wilder- ness, and the conquest of Canaan are not recorded.</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 36 murky national identity of the two midwives is another case in point. Are the two midwives who deliver the Hebrew babies Egyp- tian or Hebrew? The problem stems from the indefinite use of the word "Hebrew" ('ivriyot) in Exodus 1:15. If it is to be read as an adjective, then Shiphrah and Puah are Hebrew midwives. But then there is another possibility. The verse may mean that they are Egyptian midwives who specialize in delivering Hebrew women. Numerous commentators have tried to solve the problem. Thus, Josephus suggests that the king chose Egyptian midwives, assum- ing that they "were not likely to transgress his will." Similarly, Abarbanel claims that "they were not Hebrews but Egyptians, for how could he trust Hebrew women to put their own children to death." The Midrash, on the other hand, perceived them to be Hebrews and identified the two midwives with Yocheved and Miriam.12 What such commentaries overlook is the significance of the in- determinate origin of the midwives and the extent to which the nation's story repeats the confusion about maternal identity em- bedded in Moses' biography. Egypt is not just the site of traumas for the Hebrews. It has also been a nurturing motherland of sorts, especially the lush land of Goshen. The children of Israel are torn, just like Moses, between Egypt and Canaan, between their deep affiliation with Egypt and their desire to seek another land. The birth of Israel thus entails a painful process of individuation from the parental nation that is never fully resolved.13 Just before the parting of the Red Sea, God promises the children of Israel that they shall see the Egyptians no more (Exod. 14:13). But the drowning of the Egyptians does not lead to the effacement of Israel's strong longings for the land of Egypt. National identity is thus poised on the brink of a "loss of identity" (Kristeva 304). THE EMERGENCE OF THE NATIONAL VOICE: INTERNAL ANTI-NATAL FORCES The nation's first words are uttered on the way out of Egypt, marking the rise of what Homi Bhabha calls "counter-narratives of the nation" (300). On seeing the Egyptian chariots pursuing them, the children of Israel cry out unto the Lord. "And they said unto Moses, 'Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.'" (Exod. 14:11-12). 12 Nehama Leibowitz offers an insightful analysis of the various traditions re- garding the two midwives (31-38). 13 For more on the question of Israel's distinctiveness, see Peter Machinist.</page><page sequence="14">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL / 37 National birth means gaining consciousness and the power of verbal expression. During their bondage in Egypt, the Israelites could only moan and groan. They were in a pre-verbal and pre- conscious state, unaware of God's providence. Or else their dis- course was silenced (as they now claim), not deemed worthy of attention. Something changes with the Exodus. They acquire the capacity to verbalize their needs and cry out to the Lord through Moses. And yet the emergence of the voice of the nation is accom- panied by anti-natal cravings. The people use their new power of expression to convey their discontent, their desire to return to Egypt, to undo the birth of the nation. In a fascinating way they question the official biography. God suddenly appears to be not the deliverer of the nation, but rather the bearer of death, an abu- sive father who seeks to kill his children in the wilderness. God now seems to be just as bad, or even worse, than Pharaoh. The children of Israel are masters of complaint. This is just their first outburst, but it initiates a long series of murmurings in the desert. It has the characteristic rhetorical questions, much an- guish, and much anger. Nehama Leibowitz aptly points to their obsessive evocation of the land they left behind: "Egypt is an eter- nal refrain in their mouths, recurring five times. They yearned for 'Egypt' as a babe for its mother's breasts" (245). Egypt seems to have far more to offer than the desert-even its graves (and Egypt does indeed excel in its death culture) are more attractive than those available in the wilderness. The primary national biography is clearly far from linear. Birth does not move the children of Is- rael unambiguously forward. Another forceful desire compels them to look back to Egypt. Pharaoh, then, is not the only one who wishes to stop the birth of the nation. Anti-natal forces erupt from within as well. "The problem," as Bhabha claims, "is not simply the 'selfhood' of the nation as opposed to the otherness of other nations. We are con- fronted with the national split within itself, articulating the het- erogeneity of the population" (148). Bhabha attributes such frac- tures to the disruptive power of minorities. The story of Israel is somewhat different. In this case, it is the majority-the vox populi- that questions the national presuppositions of the leading minor- ity: Moses, his limited supporters-and God. The split is thus even more radical, given its centrality, than in Bhabha's account of the modern nation. It stems from the conflicting desires of the bulk of the nation. In a famous passage in "What Is a Nation," Ernest Renan claims that "A nation's existence is, if you will pardon the metaphor, a daily plebiscite, just as an individual's existence is a perpetual af- firmation of life" (19). For Renan the nation is a spiritual prin- ciple, represented in the will to nationhood. It is this will that uni-</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 38 fies a people, endowing them with a past, a future, and the lust for life. Renan, much like the biblical writers, relies on a personifica- tion of the nation in his exploration of nationhood. What the Bible adds to the picture, however, is an understanding of the complexity of national imagination; it reveals the extent to which the national affirmation of life may be accompanied by counterforces that do not see the formation of the nation as an urgent or essential project. A "daily plebiscite" in ancient Israel would have been a disaster. The children of Israel oscillate be- tween a euphoric celebration of their deliverance-as is the case after the parting of the Red Sea-and a continual questioning of the official consecration of national birth. Before the Israelites actually leave Egypt, Moses has already turned the Exodus into a ritual to be cherished then and in the days to come. He demands that they commemorate the event and pass the story on from one generation to another. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. .. And thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt." (Exod. 13:3-8) Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi offers a fascinating analysis of the bibli- cal injunction to remember the Exodus and the consequent ritualization of the event. What Yerushalmi overlooks is the extent to which the children of Israel cherish other memories as well. Against the recurrent command to remember the Exodus, they set up a counter-memory: Egypt. Relentless, they persist in evoking life by the Nile, where they took pleasure in fleshpots and other Egyptian delights. Individuation from Egypt does not seem to be the only route. Memory can be shaped in a variety of ways. Such counter-narratives would seem to deflate national pride. Israel's heroism does not follow traditional perceptions of male courage. There is a good deal of fear of life in the nation's nascent voice and an acute horror of what lies ahead. God Himself often regrets having delivered the nation. The children of Israel do not succeed in fulfilling His expectations, and He never hesitates to express His disappointment in them. Of the numerous unflatter- ing national representations God provides, the most resonant one is His definition of Israel as "a stiffnecked people" (Exod. 32:9). The nation withholds its body from God, and in doing so reveals a sinful lack of faith and an unwillingness to open up to the divine Word. But then Israel's challenge to the national plans of Moses and God is not merely a sign of weakness. There is something about the stiff neck of the nation and the refusal to take national imaginings for granted that reveals an unmistakable force. The nation's very name, "Israel," means to struggle with God, and in a</page><page sequence="16">BIOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ISRAEL/ 39 sense this is the nation's raison d'etre. In this respect, the biogra- phy of the eponymous father is also relevant to the understanding of the national biography. In the womb, Jacob is already struggling forcefully, trying to gain priority over his elder brother, Esau. When Rebekah asks the Lord to explain the significance of the turmoil in her womb, she is told that: "Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bow- els; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger" (Gen. 25:23). We have seen the significance of the reversal of the primogeniture law on the national level, but what this primal scene equally emphasizes is the importance of the struggle for national formation. Not only the struggle with the Other (Esau or Edom in this case) but also a struggle from within, a struggle with the ultimate precursor: God. The uterine struggle between Jacob and Esau prefigures Jacob's momentous struggle with the angel. It is through wrestling in the night with this divine being that he acquires the nation's name. "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel," says the an- gel, "for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed" (Gen. 32:28). Jacob does not become angelic as a result of this nocturnal encounter, but the struggle reveals a cer- tain kind of intimacy with God that is unparalleled. The nation, not unlike the eponymous father, is both the cho- sen son and the rebel son, and accordingly its relationship with the Father is at once intimate and strained. From the moment of Israel's birth, mutual adoration and disappointment mark the bond between the nation and God, and this is true of later stages in the nation's life as well. The tension between Israel and God only increases as the nation becomes a restless adolescent in the wilderness. In its rendition of the ambivalence that characterizes the father-son relationship, the primary biography of ancient Is- rael offers an intriguing representation of national ambivalence, making clear from the outset that the story of the nation is not a story without fissures and lapses. The national biography of Israel surely relies on certain heroic motifs, but it does not omit unflattering moments in the nation's history. The representation of national birth in Exodus is not an idealized narrative about an immaculate birth, but rather a text that takes into account the darker aspects of national formation as it explores the baffling emergence of a new people. What makes nations come into being is one of the greatest enigmas that na- tional biographies attempt to tackle. Exodus, I believe, can con- tribute much to our understanding of the imagining of such for- mative moments in its examination of how one nation jumped</page><page sequence="17">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 40 into the water despite itself and wondered why.14 The Hebrew University ofJerusalem Works Cited Alter, Robert.
