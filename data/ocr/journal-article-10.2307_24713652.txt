Written and illustrated by S.D. Sawant and S.D. Badalkar, it opens with a foreword by independent India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, which he composed during the produc tion of the comic book shortly before his death in 1964: This pictorial representation of the Gandhi story must appeal to children in India. The Gandhi story has become an essential part of our rich heri tage from the past and is still moulding our present. I am sure that gen International Journal of Hindu Studies 18, 3: 291-325 ©2014 Springer DOI 10.1007/s 11407-014-9161 -y</page><page sequence="2">292 / Karline McLain erations to come will wonder at this great story. It is well, therefore, that our children should get acquainted with it before they read more about it in books.3 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is the branch of the Govern ment of India that is mandated with disseminating knowledge and enter tainment to all sectors of society and with formulating and administering the rules and regulations relating to information and broadcasting within India. It is divided into three wings: Information, Broadcasting, and Film. The Publications Division falls under the Information wing, alongside nine other divisions, including the Photo Division, the Press Information Bureau, and the Press Council of India. The mission of the Publications Division is "to publish books and periodicals on matters of national importance in the spheres of Economy, History, Art &amp; Culture Heritage, Gandhian, Biographies of national leaders and Children's literature etc., at reason able price to facilitate wider access to people."4 To date it has published over 7,500 titles, and among these the figure of Mohandas ("Mahatma") Gandhi looms large. The "Gandhian" category of publications includes The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in one hundred volumes (avail able in print in English and Hindi, and digitally in English), as well as numerous biographies and studies of Gandhi in English and a range of Indian languages. In the 1960s, the Publications Division decided to expand beyond books and journals by adding comic books to their range of available titles, beginning with a comic book about Gandhi, who is commonly hailed as the "Father of the Nation" (rashtrapita) for his key role in the Indian Independence struggle.5 The birth of the Indian comic book industry dates back to the 1960s, when imported American superhero comic books such as Superman, Tarzan, and Mandrake the Magician were popular among the urban English-reading youth of India. The success of these foreign comics in India inspired Anant Pai to launch I he first Indian comic book series in 1967, Amar Chitra Katha, featuring both mythological and historical Indian heroes.6 But also popular in urban India in the mid-twentieth century were imported American comic book series such as Classics Illustrated and True Comics. These series were conceived of as an educational corrective to the mainstream superhero variety in the wake of the American anti-comics campaigns of the 1940s</page><page sequence="3">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 293 and 1950s, when comics were criticized for depicting brutal violence and "deviant" sexuality.7 True Comics, for instance, proclaimed on each of its covers, "Truth is stranger and a thousand times more thrilling than fic tion"; and each 64-page issue featured in brief the biographies of several American historical figures, from presidents to athletes to war heroes. The Gandhi Story was inspired by such "respectable" biographical comic books that were based on reputable historical sources and were designed to educate as well as entertain their readers, and its brief foreword makes it clear that the comic book medium, with its combination of image and text, was chosen for its perceived accessibility and appeal to the youth of India. What this foreword also makes clear—written as it was by Jawaharlal Nehru, former prime minister and longtime friend and colleague of Mahatma Gandhi—is the official status of this government-funded and produced publication. Indeed, the first line, asserting that this "pictorial representation of the Gandhi story must appeal to children in India,"8 suggests that Nehru and the Publications Division felt some urgency in the need to convey the story of Gandhi to the generation of children growing up in India in the 1960s. This urgency could arise in part from the patriotic desire to popularize Indian heroes over imported superheroes and to replace sales of foreign comic books with indigenous ones. But it likely also arose from the patriotic desire to instill some knowledge of the struggle for India's independence in the minds of these children, who were all born after independence from British colonial rule had been achieved in 1947. One can speculate that as Nehru neared his final years and as he faced the darkness of the Sino-Indian War of 1962, he wondered what would become of Gandhi's non-violent teachings in post-colonial India. In a thought-provoking study of posters and calendars—visual media that are ubiquitous throughout the villages and cities of India—Christopher Pinney has argued that popular images present a different history from that told in Indian academic history and that the divergence between these visual and textual histories "acquires its greatest saliency when thinking about the histories of two Indian freedom fighters, Gandhi and Bhagat Singh."9 He states that whereas Gandhi is well known and his non-violent ideology is well represented in textual histories of modern India, Bhagat Singh and other revolutionary figures who endorsed violence in the effort</page><page sequence="4">294 / Karline McLain to achieve independence from colonial rule are largely overlooked. Yet, Pinney argues, in popular art the situation is reversed: in popular posters and calendars Bhagat Singh and other revolutionary figures are most lionized as heroes of the freedom struggle while Gandhi is a more mar ginal presence. Commenting on the lack of available textual information about the revolutionaries who are ever-present in poster art, he writes: Official history has diverged so fundamentally from the popular narra tive that it has left us few tools with which to understand a figure such as Bhagat Singh. His pictures are...the greatest resource we have and can give us some insight into the ways in which hugely significant vis ual traces can endure in the gaps between official forms of knowledge.10 Bhagat Singh was one among many Indian revolutionaries who embraced violence as a means to achieving independence from colonial rule. In popular lore, he is best remembered for the act of throwing a bomb into the legislative assembly on April 8, 1929 (along with co-conspirator Batukeshwar Dutt). After this, Bhagat Singh was arrested, tried, and ultimately executed on March 23, 1931. Following his death, he imme diately began to be memorialized as a martyr for Indian independence. From 1931 forward throughout the independence struggle, posters of Bhagat Singh throwing the bomb, speaking up defiantly at his trial in defense of his act, and bravely offering his head to Mother India at his execution were enormously popular, despite their proscription by the British; and indeed, such posters and other images modeled upon them continue to circulate in independent India today." Noting Bhagat Singh's popular appeal—and the appeal of other militant revolutionaries including Chandra Shekhar Azad, Rajguru, and Shukhdev—Pinney argues that these pictorial affirmations of violent actions from the 1930s onward have contributed to a visual tradition of questioning the "relationship between what we might term 'official' and 'unofficial' nationalism" by suggesting the "indebtedness of official nationalism to revolutionary terrorism."12 The Gandhi Story, as a publication of the Government of India that was endorsed by its first prime minister, presents an official—that is, state sanctioned—narrative of Gandhi's life and role in the Indian struggle for independence. But given the uniqueness of the comic book medium as a</page><page sequence="5">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 295 form of sequential art that combines text and image in a procession of panels, the creators of The Gandhi Story drew upon not only textual sources, but also visual sources as reference material during its creation. This paper examines the textual and the visual components of The Gandhi Story comic book in order to further investigate the relationship between official and unofficial nationalisms and between textual and visual sources of twentieth-century Indian history, asking whether they diverge as funda mentally as Pinney suggests. I argue that although official nationalist sources do frequently privilege Gandhi's non-violent teachings while unofficial nationalist sources often laud the violent acts of revolutionary figures, the two nationalisms are not always as oppositional as Pinney puts forth. Instead, although there is disagreement about the proper place of violence in the independence struggle, both official and unofficial sources converge upon the figure of the slain patriot. Once slain, whether executed by the colonial power like Bhagat Singh or assassinated by a fellow countryman like Gandhi, both official and unofficial sources—be they textual or visual, state sponsored or popular publication—uphold the deceased figures as exemplary citizens of the nation. Telling the Official Story of the Mahatma The primary reference sources used by Sawant and Badalkar in creat ing The Gandhi Story comic book are Gandhi's writings, especially An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth (which Gandhi began writing and publishing in serial installments in the late 1920s), and photographs taken of Gandhi throughout his lifetime that were published in various news media and also served as references for popular posters and calendars. In this section I analyze the textual narrative of Gandhi's life story presented in this comic book and the textual references utilized in its production, while the next section focuses on the visual narrative and references; given the nature of the comic book as a mixed medium, however, some text-image discussion necessarily occurs throughout each of these two sections. Written in a reflective, confessional tone, Gandhi's autobiography is an account of his lifelong quest for truth and self-realization.13 Thus, as he reflects upon his childhood, Gandhi recounts incidents in which he remained truthful even when pressured to lie, such as when a British edu</page><page sequence="6">296 / Karline McLain cational inspector came to his high school and Gandhi's teacher, seeing that he had misspelled the word "kettle," encouraged Gandhi to copy his neighbor's vocabulary answers during a spelling quiz.14 Gandhi's refusal to cheat is rendered faithfully in three panels on the top of page 2 of The Gandhi Story, where Gandhi's teacher rebukes him, stating in a dialogue balloon, "Stupid boy! All the other boys have spelt correctly," while young Gandhi sits quietly at his desk, silently proclaiming to himself in a thought balloon, "I will not cheat!"15 But in his autobiography Gandhi also recounts incidents in which he failed to live up to the truthfulness of his childhood hero, King Harishchandra who never told a lie, such as when he lied to his mother about eating meat or to his father about stealing some gold from his brother's armlet. In discussing these events, Gandhi writes about how he was agonized by such falsehoods and how he ultimately found peace and repentance through a "clean confession, combined with a promise never to commit the sin again."16 The Gandhi Story also depicts these incidents in several panels on page 3 and in general remains faithful to the tone of Gandhi's autobiography by presenting him not as a natural born leader or a flawless hero, but instead as a fallible human who strove throughout his lifetime to better himself and society. This presentation of Gandhi as a fallible yet inspirational human being is perhaps best seen in The Gandhi Story's account of the civil disobedi ence protests of the Rowlatt Act and the ensuing massacre at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919. In the first panel on page 19, the Rowlatt Act is introduced through a panel depicting a massive crowd of Indians gathering in anger over this proposed Act, which would allow the British government to indefinitely retain some of its wartime powers in the aftermath of the First World War in order to counteract revolutionary activity. In the next panel Gandhi proclaims that he will call upon his countrymen to observe a hartal, a general strike, in protest at this violation of their civil liberties. The next panel features an empty street with all of the storefronts closed, accompanied by narrative text at the top that proclaims, "The hartal was a great success all over the country." However, the next panel informs us "there was some violence." In this image Gandhi is presented lecturing a group of young men, telling them that throwing stones is not satyagraha, or non-violent civil resistance. In the fifth panel Gandhi is shown seated before a large crowd, explaining his decision to suspend the hartal. "I miscalculated. I overlooked that people must be trained in civil obedience</page><page sequence="7">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 297 before such a movement can succeed. We must call off the hartal." In the sixth and last panel on this page, Gandhi is depicted frontally, with a speech balloon that explains the importance of ahimsa, or non-violence: "Ahimsa is not simply non-injury to others. It means love for all that lives. 17 I love the enemy but I fight evil." Here Gandhi is again presented not as a flawless hero, but as a role model for others in his willingness to accept his human errors and learn from them. This presentation of Gandhi is in keeping with Gandhi's own autobiographic account of these events, for he writes about his regret at initiating satyagraha prematurely: "I had called on the people to launch upon civil disobedience before they had thus qualified themselves for it, and this mistake seemed to me of Hima layan magnitude."18 The next page of The Gandhi Story shifts to Amritsar, focusing on the observance of the hartal and its aftermath in this city in particular. The first panel depicts a pink telegraph slip addressed to the home secretary in Delhi with only five words printed on it: "Violent mob murdered three Europeans." The narrative text at the top of the panel provides further context: "The city of Amritsar observed two days' peaceful hartal. But the government externed two popular leaders. This enraged the people." The British Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer is the focus of the next three panels, wherein he takes charge as the commanding military officer in the area and prohibits all public meetings in one panel; learns of a meeting taking place in the Jallianwala Bagh area in the next panel; and then commands his soldiers to open fire upon the assembled crowd in the following panel. Here the image of Dyer commanding "Fire!" is accom panied by narrative text that states, "Between ten and twenty thousand persons had gathered in the Bagh, which was surrounded by buildings. There were only two small exits. Without giving any warning to the crowd to disperse, Dyer shouted out his order." The next panel shifts the focus away from Dyer and to the massacre itself by depicting bullet-ridden bodies lying about the grounds, with accompanying text that provides these statistics: "1650 rounds were fired. 379 died, 1137 were wounded." The sixth and final panel on this page then returns to Dyer, depicting him before the Hunter Inquiry Committee and citing him justifying his act by claiming that he had to attempt to kill everyone present in order to "produce a sufficient moral effect from a military point of view." The narrative box at the bottom of this panel returns the reader's attention to Gandhi by</page><page sequence="8">298 / Karline McLain including a small cutout of his face accompanied by text stating, "Dyer's cruelty embittered India and distressed Gandhi."19 In British historiography, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre has been remembered as an aberration of colonial rule, a singular event that was the product of one misguided individual, Brigadier-General Dyer. As Derek Sayer has noted, this view of the massacre has allowed the British to conveniently erase the event from British history, dismissing it as a 20 monstrous act committed by one person. In Indian historiography, on the other hand, both official state-sponsored sources and unofficial popular press sources have remembered the Jallianwala Bagh massacre not as a singular aberration committed by one individual, but as the colonial wrong par excellence in which colonial officers killed non-violent Indians in a violent outburst. By 1926, a lantern slideshow of the massacre was being used by nationalist workers to demonstrate to Indians everywhere [hat they were "bound together because of their vulnerability to an illegitimate, foreign regime."21 This sentiment continued to echo across the many nationalist factions and parties throughout the struggle for independence over the next two decades and has continued to inform history textbooks in India to this day.22 Gandhi was deeply distressed by the massacre. He helped to organize a minority committee (consisting of Indian committee members, as opposed to the majority committee of colonial officers), launch an investigation into the matter, and draft a report of their findings. In discussing the report in his autobiography, Gandhi makes it clear that he views the massacre not as the responsibility of Dyer alone, but of the British government as a whole: This report, prepared as it was solely with a view to bringing out the truth and nothing but the truth, will enable the reader to see to what lengths the British Government is capable of going, and what inhu manities and barbarities it is capable of perpetrating in order to main tain its power." Yet a third historiography of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre exists in India, circulating in Hindu nationalist-leaning circles. This narrative holds Gandhi partially to blame for the tragedy, alleging that his message of non-violence served only to weaken the freedom struggle by positioning Indians as passive victims who would not or could not defend themselves</page><page sequence="9">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 299 or their country from such colonial onslaughts. For these nationalists, Jallianwala Bagh is therefore not only a symbol of British inhumanity, but also a symbol of all that is wrong with Gandhian ideology and of the need for a more active, militant form of nationalism. Thus in the popular Amar Chitra Katha comic book series, the issue Bhagat Singh depicts the revolutionary as a young man who visits Jallianwala Bagh in the wake of the massacre, bowing down to collect some of the soil now "anointed with the blood of patriots" and vowing that he is willing to "sacrifice everything for the cause."24 The remainder of the comic book depicts Bhagat Singh's decision to take the revolutionary path, culminating in his trial statement in defense of the act of throwing a bomb into the legislative assembly and his subsequent hanging. In my interviews with Satyavrata Ghosh, a retired professor of political science and a former revolutionary who has authored several books about the independence movement and also acted as a contributing editor for the Amar Chitra Katha comic books about Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries, he stated that his goal is to "publicize the revolutionaries, the 'other stream' " and not the "mainstream," which "in the name of so-called peace and non-violence shut out the contribution of those who advocated violence 95 in the freedom struggle." Ghosh feels strongly that school textbooks and other "official" or "mainstream" Indian sources incorrectly give Gandhi and his colleagues all of the credit for achieving India's independence, at the expense of the revolutionaries. In addition to Bhagat Singh, numerous issues throughout the Amar Chitra Katha series employ text and image pairings that depict the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and associate it with Gandhi's satyagraha movement to repeatedly suggest that Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence is flawed, for it is only rewarded with violence in the end, and that the martyred revolutionaries are worthy of being remembered as the true heroes of the freedom struggle.26 The Gandhi Story's telling of the events leading up to and including the Jallianwala Bagh massacre demonstrates the creators' efforts to render an official nationalist narrative in this medium that is in strict keeping with Gandhi's writings and teachings. As in his autobiography, Gandhi is presented here as a fallible human, shown realizing on page 19 that he must instruct the people in the methods of non-violence before he can begin a massive civil disobedience campaign. However, unlike the comics in the Amar Chitra Katha series, The Gandhi Story does not suggest that</page><page sequence="10">300 / Karline McLain Gandhi or his non-violent message were responsible in any way for the massacre. Instead, this comic book explicitly holds Brigadier-General Dyer to blame and implicates the colonial regime more generally by con tinuing to discuss other examples of "British harshness"27 in the following pages. Furthermore, the problem of violence is not presented as a monop oly of the British; here Indians are also incriminated for the violence culminating in the massacre—albeit more subtly, through text alone, unaccompanied by images of the violent acts—in the panels in which we are informed that Indians threw stones28 and murdered three Europeans.29 Repeatedly, The Gandhi Story presents violence itself as the villain, no matter what person or community of people wields it. Again and again, Gandhi puts his life on the line in standing up to violence, teaching his followers that they must fight injustice but embrace their opponents, reit erating in deed his message that he loves the enemy but fights evil.30 On pages 12-13, for instance, Gandhi's satyagraha to repeal anti-Indian leg islation in South Africa is depicted. In one panel on the bottom left of page 12 we are informed that "the government used harsh measures" in the attempt to stop the satyagraha, and the image depicts soldiers on horseback charging and beating the crowd of protestors. Gandhi rallies his followers in the next panel, delivering the speech, "Our struggle is for human liberty, human dignity. Are you prepared to face bullets, if need •} i be?" The crowd enthusiastically replies, "Yes, yes." On the next page Gandhi meets with General J.C. Smuts, colonial secretary of the Transvaal, who agrees to Gandhi's requests. While General Smuts thinks to himself, "I have the highest respect for this man,"32 a victorious Gandhi is shown setting sail for India. Similarly, in the depiction of the Salt March and Dharasana Salt Works Satyagraha of 1930 on pages 26-27, Gandhi writes to the British viceroy to inform him that he plans to break the salt tax laws in an attempt to "check the organised violence of the British Government" with his organized non-violence.33 He prepares his followers for the series of arrests and assaults that ensue, which are depicted in several panels. But in the final panel of this two-page spread, the peaceful Gandhian protestors are shown to have victoriously survived the brutality of the colonial soldiers, and the caption reads, "Gandhiji had made Indians fear less."34 Thus, although Gandhi is presented as a fallible human rather than a flawless hero, he is nonetheless presented as a leader of men capable of achieving great things through his non-violent teachings and method.</page><page sequence="11">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 301 The greatest contrast between Hindu nationalist-leaning sources of unofficial nationalism and The Gandhi Story's rendition of official nation alism is found in the depiction of the events surrounding independence in 1947. At the time of independence the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into two separate countries, the secular and democratic Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (East and West; now Bangladesh and Pakistan). Partition caused widespread chaos and unprecedented communal conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The Partition of India and the ensuing bloodshed deeply pained Gandhi, who went to great lengths to reach out to both religious communities and calm the commu nal fires. In The Gandhi Story, Gandhi is shown roaming from one town to the next delivering his message, "Let us pray that God should purify ic the hearts of both Hindus and Muslims"; fasting to return sanity to riot stricken Calcutta;36 and holding ecumenical prayer meetings in Delhi.37 Gandhi was adamant that he did not want independence at the cost of so much violence, and the comic book illustrates this in one panel in which Gandhi is shown with his eyes closed in prayer, while a thought balloon reveals his sentiments to us: "Truth and non-violence are more important to me than political freedom."38 But many Indians disagreed with this sentiment. Criticizing Gandhi for his willingness to delay independence and for conceding too much to the Muslim minority, some Hindus rejected Gandhian ideology in favor of joining more militant Hindu nationalist organizations such as the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayam sevak Sangh. These organizations embraced the vision of India as a Hindu nation, lionized the martial contributions of Hindu and Sikh freedom fighters, and vilified both Muslims and Gandhi for allowing the Partition of India to happen. One such Hindu nationalist was Nathuram Vinayak Godse. In the 1920s Godse participated briefly in Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, but he grew increasingly outspoken about his disagreements with Gandhi and eventually rejected Gandhism to embrace the Hindu nationalist teachings of the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Godse founded his own newspaper, Hindu Rashtra, to articulate how Gandhism was emasculating Hindus and to urge Hindus to actively defend their nation.39 The Partition of India was the final straw. Godse and several co conspirators began planning the assassination of Gandhi and carried it out on January 30, 1948. Although Godse embraced the same martial</page><page sequence="12">302 / Karline McLain tactics in the freedom struggle as his revolutionary predecessors Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad, he is a far more controversial figure in unofficial nationalist narratives because the target of his martial activity was not the British oppressors, but the Mahatma. Nonetheless, in some especially strident Hindu nationalist circles, Godse too has been hailed as a hero of the independence movement, as Peter Gottschalk discovered during his field research in Arampur village, Bihar, when one villager— a member of the Sangh—condoned Gandhi's assassination and had this to say about Godse: "He was not a bad man. He was a great man. How can a division happen in a house? He did not want it. How dangerous is Pakistan?! But Mahatma Gandhi made it happen."40 In such circles (particularly in Godse's home state of Maharashtra), popular artifacts including images of the assassination of Gandhi and reprints of the speech Godse gave in his defense at trial circulate among the members.41 The difference between the recounting of the assassination of Gandhi in The Gandhi Story and in the Amar Chitra Katha comic book series is significant. After publishing dozens of issues in the 1970s and 1980s about revolutionary heroes who took up arms against the British, the producers of Amar Chitra Katha decided to release two issues about Gandhi in 1989, titled Mahatma Gandhi I: The Early Days and Mahatma Gandhi II: Father of the Nation. The Amar Chitra Katha series is a popular source of unof ficial Hindu nationalism that privileges martial Hindu heroes (mythological, medieval, and modern) who fight their opponents (demons, medieval Muslim kings, and modern British colonial officers) on the battlefield and either emerge victorious or die bravely for their cause.42 Thus Gandhi, with his philosophy of non-violence and his quest for Hindu-Muslim unity, did not fit into the same heroic mold as the heroes of earlier issues of this comic book series. This dilemma, along with debates in the studio over differing nationalist allegiances, as expressed by Satyavrata Ghosh above, caused the creators to delay producing titles about Gandhi and when they did, to arrive at a rendering of the assassination of Gandhi in Mahatma Gandhi II that is ambivalent about Godse's act. In the single panel depicting the assassination, Godse and Gandhi are each depicted in profile, facing one another. They stand in the midst of a crowd, with Godse's gun positioned as the focal point of the image, encircled in a large yellow halo. The narrative text at the top reads, "But Gandhi's efforts to unite the people did not please everyone. At 5:10 p.m. on January 30,</page><page sequence="13">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 303 1948..."43 Here, by focusing on the act of the assassination and not the actor—Godse is not even named in the comic book—this issue neither exculpates nor blames Godse for his act, but instead leaves it up to the reader to decide whether Godse is a hero or a villain, whether his deed should be mourned or celebrated.44 In The Gandhi Story, on the other hand, Godse is identified as the assas sin and his violent act is condemned in the narrative text. The comic book sets up the event by explaining that Gandhi had encouraged the newly formed Indian government to pay 550 million rupees to Pakistan as its share in the assets of pre-Partition India.45 It then depicts an attempt on Gandhi's life by an angry refugee of Partition named Madanlal. This is followed by a panel depicting Godse, with a thought balloon stating, "Gandhi has ruined India. Fifty-five crores to Pakistan! I must save Hin duism." Above this, the brief text names this angry figure, attempts to explain his motivation, and denounces him, "Nathuram Godse, another fanatic, came from Poona to Delhi, with a drastic plan. He, too, believed that Gandhiji unduly favoured Muslims."46 The assassination takes place over the next four panels on pages 46-47, which are accompanied by a minimum of text: Gandhi walks to his prayer meeting; he stands before the crowd that has gathered, at the forefront of which is Godse; Godse shoots Gandhi; and then Gandhi, his chest now spotted with blood, begins to fall over as he cries out, "Ram, Ram!" (God, God!). Following this, the final two panels of the comic book depict Gandhi's cremation and his funeral ceremony, citing Albert Einstein's memorial comment that "Gen erations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth" and Jawaharlal Nehru's comment that Gandhi was the light that "represented the living truth...reminding us of the right path, taking this ancient country to freedom."47 Thus overall, The Gandhi Story retells in comic book format an official narrative of Gandhi's life that is largely based on his autobiography and other writings; that dismisses violence, no matter whether it is enacted by a fellow Indian or by the British; and that highlights Gandhi's non-violent methods as the "right path" to freedom. Showing the Official Story of the Mahatma In illustrating The Gandhi Story, Sawant and Badalkar sought out visual</page><page sequence="14">304 / Karline McLain reference materials that contained narrative details about the life and actions of Gandhi and would therefore help them to flesh out the images necessary to accompany the official textual narrative of the comic book. Thus they turned to the many photographs of Gandhi that were taken throughout his lifetime. Many panels within the comic book are therefore "realistic" illustrations that were directly inspired by this photographic archive: the panel depicting Gandhi in uniform as a member of the Indian Ambulance Corps during the Boer War;48 the panel depicting Gandhi intently focused upon spinning for his khadi (Indian handspun cloth) campaign;49 the panels depicting Gandhi leading his followers on the Salt March and then bending down to collect salt at Dandi Beach;50 the panels depicting Gandhi talking on a telephone51 and speaking into a micro phone;52 the panel depicting Gandhi with his walking stick, deep in thought 53 during a walk in Noakhali in the midst of pre-Partition riots; and, based on one of the most famous photographs of Gandhi by photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, the panel depicting Gandhi walking with the aid of his grandnieces, Abha and Manu, on the occasion of one of his last prayer meetings in Delhi prior to his assassination.54 These are but a few examples, drawn from some of the most widely reprinted photographs of Gandhi55 However, despite this reliance upon historical photographs, the images in The Gandhi Story are not mere illustrations of the textual narrative— in many panels they extend beyond the documentary imperative and open up space for the heroic idealization of this historic figure through the employment of several visual tactics. One such tactic is the use of a hieratic scale in select panels to visually emphasize the importance of Gandhi. On page 12, for instance, Gandhi is depicted rallying his follow ers in South Africa to engage in satyagraha in the attempt to repeal anti Indian legislation. Gandhi states, "Our struggle is for human liberty, human dignity. Are you prepared to face bullets, if need be?" The crowd enthusiastically replies, "Yes, yes."56 Here Gandhi is presented as. a figure of supernatural size, towering above his fellow Indians. Similarly, on page 22 Gandhi is again depicted rallying his followers, this time in India in 1922 just after being sentenced to serve time in jail for seditious writing. In the last panel on this page, Gandhi proclaims before his distraught followers, "Freedom is to be wooed inside prison walls and sometimes on the gallows."57 Here, too, Gandhi is depicted hieratically rather than naturalistically, standing head-and-shoulders above all of the</page><page sequence="15">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 305 people who circle around him. A further break from naturalism occurs in this image in the decision to depict Gandhi, here clothed only in a dhoti (loincloth), as a barrel-chested figure with bulging pectoral muscles. This vision of Gandhi stands apart from that presented in the Amar Chitra Katha series, in which Gandhi is proclaimed to be a "leader of the nation" CO in the narrative text in the final panel of Mahatma Gandhi I, but the accompanying image features a seated, shrunken Gandhi who is so small in scale that the reader must look down upon him rather than up to him as to other, more martial leaders in the comic series.59 A second visual tactic that opens up space for the heroic idealization of Gandhi is the usage of a halo or aureole in select panels. In the first panel on page 8, for instance, a young Gandhi is depicted in profile, with a thought balloon that explains his decision not to accept costly gifts from those he has helped while in South Africa, for he is "a servant of the people."60 Here a large halo of radiant yellow, orange, and pink colors is placed behind Gandhi. In several other panels Gandhi is set apart through a similar effect, an aureole of radiant white light surrounding his entire body, as in the top-right panel on page 21, in which Gandhi decides to embark upon a boycott of all things British, including employment, hon orary titles, and education. Here again, the usage of this effect is not found in Amar Chitra Katha, where the only halo in the Mahatma Gandhi II comic book is placed not around Gandhi's head, but around the gun fired by Nathuram Godse in the assassination panel on page 31—thereby high lighting the violent act of the assassination.61 In The Gandhi Story, on the other hand, the presence of haloes and aureoles around Gandhi in multiple panels not only highlights Gandhi and his idealism, but also works to subtly deify him, suggesting that he is a sacred persona shrouded by a supernatural splendor that sets him apart from other mortals. Finally, a third tactic that encourages the heroic idealization of Gandhi is the usage of frontality in multiple panels within the pages of The Gandhi Story. Repeatedly, when Gandhi is delivering an important message about his philosophy that the comic book creators want to emphasize, Gandhi is placed in a frontal position within a panel so that he speaks not to his followers in the storyline, but instead directly addresses the comic book readers. This is the case in the panel on page 19 discussed above, in which Gandhi looks straight ahead, both eyes staring out at the reader as he explains the meaning of a concept central to his teachings, ahimsa. It is</page><page sequence="16">306 / Karline McLain also the case in the two panels on the top of page 31 when Gandhi explains the central importance of the villages in India and the need to understand the daily struggles of the workers in those villages, again while looking out at the comic book reader rather than speaking to his colleagues Jamnalal Bajaj and Mahadev Desai. Such frontality arises from the Hindu devo tional practice of darshan, that is, seeing and being seen by the gods.62 Once again, the contrast with Amar Chitra Katha is instructive: the crea tors of the Amar Chitra Katha comic books chose not to employ frontality with Gandhi, though they do use this visual tactic with other figures in the series, including Hindu gods like Krishna and martial Hindu kings like Rana Pratap.63 Here in the first panel on page 31 of The Gandhi Story, on the other hand, Gandhi not only faces the reader in order to bless them with his glance, he also has his hand raised with his palm facing outward to the reader in a gesture of blessing that is typical of Hindu deities. Again, this visual tactic works not only to visually present Gandhi as an ideal figure, but also to subtly deify him. Thus when contrasted with the popular Amar Chitra Katha comic book series, The Gandhi Story stands apart in its narrative of Gandhi's life and his role in the freedom struggle. The Amar Chitra Katha series aligns with the unofficial Hindu nationalist narrative by heroically highlighting the lives and deaths of revolutionaries in the dozens of comic books about martial revolutionary heroes that have been printed in the series and more subtly questions Gandhi's role as the leader of the freedom struggle through the text-image pairings made by the creators of the Mahatma Gandhi I and II comics. The Gandhi Story, on the other hand, utilizes both text and image to position Gandhi as the clear leader of the freedom struggle and to credit his non-violent protest method as the right path that ultimately culminated in the victory of independence. Furthermore, The Gandhi Story also stands apart in its employment of visual tactics that go beyond the textual narrative in their idealization—even deification—of this historical figure. Significantly, each of these visual tactics can be found in popular posters and other unofficial images of Gandhi that cir culated throughout India in the decades prior to the creation of this comic book, suggesting that the producers looked to these unofficial sources as visual reference material alongside photographs in the making of this official publication. In his detailed analysis of popular Indian posters and calendars, Pinney</page><page sequence="17">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 307 has argued that Bhagat Singh and other revolutionary figures dominate popular visual sources of nationalism while Gandhi is a more marginal presence. Furthermore, he argues, those images of Gandhi that were published by the larger lithographic presses generally depicted Gandhi "in a rational and empty space," drawing upon photographic portraits, without the use of narrative details commonly found in the posters of revolutionary figures: The earliest chromolithographie Gandhi images are simple elaborations of the sort of photographic portraits used frequently in newspapers. The Ravi Varma Press's Mahatma Gandhi, which probably dates from about 1931, depicts him staff in hand. Two portraits published by the Modern Litho Works, Bombay, and dating from about the same time are also clearly modeled on photographs....The most famous image of this period, Brijbasi's exquisite lithograph printed in Germany, was prepared by the artist M.C. Trivedi from a photograph taken as Gandhi left Karachi en route to the Round Table Conference. All these images establish Gandhi's purity and simplicity. Apart from the garlands in the Modern Litho Works's example there is nothing ostentatious in the images, indeed there is in fact almost nothing else apart from Gandhi.64 However, Pinney continues, following Gandhi's assassination in 1948, new images began to be issued by the major lithographic presses that were very different from previous images of Gandhi. In these posters, which Pinney terms "apotheosis" images, Gandhi is shown ascending upward into the heavenly realm, arriving in the world of the gods, and raising his hand to bless his devotees while standing atop the earth.65 Sumathi Ramaswamy, on the other hand, astutely observes that it may be an overstatement on Pinney's part to suggest that Gandhi was a mar ginal presence in popular images prior to his assassination. Instead, she asserts that given the vast amount of posters from the 1920s onward that depicted him portrait style, or with his spinning wheel, or marching to collect salt, or saving Mother India, he is clearly Mother India's "favour ite son in popular Indian visual productions, rivaling others like Bhagat Singh and Subhas Bose by the consistency of his appearance in her com pany."66 Indeed, in Gandhi's own lifetime, many Indians, especially rural villagers, had already begun to deify Gandhi, waiting in massive crowds</page><page sequence="18">308 / Karline McLain to receive darshan of him as he traveled on trains through village after village, and some even went so far as to believe Gandhi was an incarna tion of God in human form along the lines of the Hindu gods Rama and Krishna, both avatars (incarnations) of Vishnu.67 Posters depicting Gandhi in this fashion did circulate while he was alive, such as the circa 1930 "Kaliya Mardan"68 image of Gandhi holding his charkha (spinning wheel) aloft while dancing on the hood of a snake labeled "Oppression," an infer ence to British colonial rule. This image references the popular posters of the god Krishna holding his flute aloft while dancing on the hood of the demon-snake Kaliya, prepared to trample him to death for poisoning the Yamuna River. It suggests that Gandhi, like Krishna in the mythic past, is the divine saving grace for this current era. Gandhi, however, who was uncomfortable even with the title "Mahatma" (Great Soul), was disturbed by such deification, as were his well-educated colleagues. In his autobiography, Gandhi writes about his work with the peasants in Champaran district, Bihar, noting that "an army" of them came and filled the area to overflowing, demanding darshan.69 Gandhi appointed some of his companions "to save me from darshan-seekers" and is particularly grateful to one Professor Kripalani whom he describes as his "gate-keeper in chief," writing, "For the time being he made it the end and aim of his life to save me from darshan-seekers. He warded off people, calling to his aid now his unfailing humour, now his non-violent threats."70 Thus the official Gandhian narrative does not claim superhuman status for Gandhi, and neither therefore does The Gandhi Story in its explicit textual narrative, which faithfully presents Gandhi as an inspi rational yet fallible and human leader. Nonetheless, The Gandhi Story does open up visual space for just such a claim through the three tactics described earlier. Debates as to whether and to what extent Gandhi was marginalized in popular imagery notwithstanding, Pinney's observation of the change that occurs in images of him after his death is insightful. Upon Gandhi's assassination, a new spate of images began to be produced in the popular press that depicted him ascending to the realm of the gods and showering his blessings down upon India from the height of that heavenly abode It is in these post-assassination apotheosis images, in particular, that the three visual tactics mentioned above are widely utilized to suggest that Gandhi has somehow transcended the human realm. Hieratic positioning</page><page sequence="19">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 309 can be seen in posters of Gandhi from the 1930s, such as the circa 1935 poster of him as the "Bringer of Peace"71 to the rural masses, in which he faces the viewer, his hand raised in a gesture of blessing, looming twice as large as any of the villagers who fill the background. However, upon his assassination hieratic positioning is regularly utilized to portray Gandhi as the savior not just of the rural masses, but of all of India from on high. In the circa 1948 poster "Our Saviour,"72 for example, Gandhi stands in cruciform posture, with millions of Indians worshiping his feet, while his torso ascends up into the clouds, where heavenly spirits (apsaras) worship his shoulders. This image employs the other two visual tactics as well: Gandhi is crowned by a radiant yellow halo, and he is positioned frontally so that both eyes gaze out at the viewer of the poster. Discussing haloes in particular, Ramaswamy writes: What does make him [Gandhi] stand out, though, in these bazaar images, is the halo that begins to appear around his head, especially after his martyrdom and his subsequent apotheosis. In this patriotic pictorial world, the consensus appears to be that Gandhi is the conduit between the terrestrial realm and the world of the (Hindu) gods by virtue of his saintly "mahatma"-like behaviour on earth. After his assassination, he leaves the earthly realm and joins this divine sphere from where he showers his blessings on India, and the men (and occasionally women) who occupy it, transforming in the process his country into a punya bhumi, a hallowed land.73 Again, although haloes were used in earlier images of Gandhi, such as the "Kaliya Mardan" image discussed above, they become prevalent in post-assassination images that show him rising, often in a gilded chariot, into the heavens either above a map of India (as in the 1948 "Ascent to Heaven"74) or above his own cremation fire (as in the 1948 "Gandhi's Heavenly Journey"75). Frontality, too, can be found in a number of pre assassination images of Gandhi, including portrait-style lithographs in which he looks directly out at the viewer, occasionally with one hand raised in a gesture of blessing or with both hands folded together in namaste. After his death, however, frontality is more often than not the norm, so that the viewer can exchange darshan with this transcendent figure and receive his blessings. Thus the visual choices made by the</page><page sequence="20">310 / Karline McLain creators of The Gandhi Story indicate that they were familiar with such post-assassination apotheosis posters of Gandhi that were printed by numer ous popular presses and that they looked to them as well, alongside the more "realistic" photographic archive and portrait-style posters, as refer ence material for their official comic book. Following Gandhi's assassination, Pinney notes a second type of Gandhi poster that began to circulate, in addition to the apotheosis images. Terming this type the "avatar cycle" image, he writes: Perhaps the most revealing images, however, are those that suggest Gandhi's status as an avatar through their appropriation of the pictorial forms of avatar representation. Since the 1880s, prints have been in circulation depicting Vishnu and his avatars....Krishna may be given the central place and his biography then unfolds in a clockwise set of vignettes. These images give form to the notion that the enduring abstract form of Vishnu is periodically made manifest through different incarnations who descend to play their role in the affairs of man.. .In the artist Dinanath's Evolution of Gandhi, published by Kananyalal Lachoomal of Delhi, the circle of Gandhi's life is mediated by his corpse shrouded in a flag (bearing his last words, "Hare Ram") at the bottom of the picture. At the start of the circle at the bottom left we see his birth from a lotus, his early years as a suited barrister, the Dandi salt march at the top and so on.76 Ramaswamy discusses another avatar cycle poster, this one created in 1948 by the artist L.K. Sharma for the Picture Publishing Corporation, titled "The Immortal Story of Gandhi." Again modeled on the format used since the late nineteenth century to depict key incidents in the lives of the gods with a dozen or so narrative vignettes framing a central image of the deity, here too narrative vignettes of key moments in Gandhi's life frame a central image of the now-deceased Gandhi. Such vignettes— based on photographs—include Gandhi as a newborn baby, Gandhi as a student in London dressed in a suit and tie, Gandhi dressed as a satyagrahi in South Africa, Gandhi seated at his spinning wheel clad in a dhoti, Gandhi before a microphone making a nationalist speech, and Gandhi lying prone on his bier en route to his cremation. Describing this poster Ramaswamy writes:</page><page sequence="21">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 311 These vignettes are arranged clockwise around what Sharma obviously saw as the central feature of Gandhi's "immortal" story—his martyrdom for India and the map of the nation, an image that does not exist in the photographic record. Occupying the centre of the poster is the smiling dhoti-clad image of Gandhi, holding a staff in one hand, carrying a red book (the Bhagavadgita, his favourite scripture) in the other. Bright red blood from three carefully placed bullet wounds in his chest drips down to form a puddle on the outline map of the Indian nation drawn on the face of a terrestrial globe. Photographic realism gives way to patriotic mythography.77 To add to this "patriotic mythography" that suggests that an immortal Gandhi lives on even at the end of this lifecycle, this vision of Gandhi at the center of the image is a frontal one, complete with a halo, positioned hieratically standing atop the globe. The images in The Gandhi Story indicate that Sawant and Badalkar were as influenced by such avatar cycle images as they were by apotheo sis images. Indeed, I would argue that the entirety of The Gandhi Story comic book can be understood as an avatar cycle: Gandhi is given the central place on the cover of the comic book, where he is depicted lov ingly rubbing noses with a young child holding a banana,78 and his biog raphy from his own childhood until his death then unfolds in a set of vignettes presented from panel to panel on the pages of the comic book. What makes it possible to view this as a cycle, rather than just a chrono logical biography of Gandhi from his birth to his death, is the overlapping of the final panel in the comic book with the cover image of Gandhi at the start of the narrative. Following panels depicting the assassination of Gandhi and his cremation, the final panel contains the memorial state ments by Jawaharlal Nehru and Albert Einstein, accompanied by an image of a smiling Gandhi holding a smiling baby. This image, which is based on a photo taken of Gandhi playing with a child while sailing on the S.S. Rajputana in 1931, eliminates the historical context and instead places Gandhi and the baby up in the heavens, inset within a circle of blue sky and white clouds. The cover image similarly eliminates the historical context and places Gandhi and the baby before a background reminiscent of a cloud-filled blue sky. Thus the entire comic book narra tive is framed by these two images of a transcendent Gandhi in the heav</page><page sequence="22">312 / Karline McLain ens with a young Indian child, suggesting a closed loop of death and rebirth and visually hinting that Gandhi—or at least his ideology—will live on in the next generation. Conclusion: Martyrdom and the Mahatma This analysis of The Gandhi Story comic book makes four contributions to the ongoing study of Mahatma Gandhi and his role in India's freedom struggle. First, it points out the need to seriously consider the relationship between text and image in publications about Gandhi, for text and image may be "saying" two different things, even in a single work. The Gandhi Story was an effort undertaken by the Publications Division of the Gov ernment of India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to pair the official textual history of Gandhi and the freedom struggle with images and thereby convey to children born into independent India in the 1960s some knowledge of the struggle for independence that had been waged by the previous generations; of Gandhi's significant role in that struggle; and of Gandhian ideology more generally. In their effort to create this comic book history, Sawant and Badalkar drew heavily upon "realistic" documentary sources, including Gandhi's autobiography and photographs taken of him throughout his lifetime, for the inspiration behind their script and illustrations. Textually, The Gandhi Story carefully follows the official Gandhian narrative of the freedom struggle by crediting Gandhi and his non-violent method with successfully bringing about the freedom of India; by dismissing all violence, no matter who perpetrates it or for what end; and by characterizing Gandhi along the lines of his autobiog raphy as a fallible human, rather than a flawless hero, who must learn to overcome his weaknesses to become a national leader. Visually, however, The Gandhi Story goes beyond the official Gandhian narrative and pre sents Gandhi as a deified hero of the nation by utilizing visual tactics com monly found in unofficial posters of Gandhi printed by various popular presses since his assassination in 1948 (and found occasionally in earlier posters), including hieratic positioning, haloes and aureoles, and darshan inducing frontality. These images do not just illustrate the official text of the comic book then, but instead supplement it with further, unofficial narrative meaning by suggesting that Gandhi now inhabits a heavenly realm overlooking India and its citizens and showering his blessings</page><page sequence="23">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 313 down upon those who seek darshan of him. Second, this analysis builds upon the work of other visual scholars of modern India to point out that the range of unofficial nationalist images produced by popular presses is more diverse than has perhaps been rec ognized. Pinney is correct in pointing out that revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh have been praised in popular posters and calendars. However, as Ramaswamy notes, " 'bazaar' artists have ranged from those who are overtly Hindu nationalist to those who would subscribe to Gandhian and Indian nationalist secularism, with every ideological strand in between."79 To state that Gandhi has been marginalized in popular imagery is to neglect not only the more secular portrait-style lithographs produced by the major presses during his lifetime, but also the more devotional apotheosis and Rft avatar cycle images produced by the same presses after his death, as well as the many images produced by smaller presses that fall into the fuzzy middle of the nationalist spectrum by depicting Gandhi working alongside revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh in the service of freeing Mother India. Erwin Neumayer and Christine Schelberger, for instance, discuss the 1931 poster "Great Martyrs of India" by the artist Rupkishor Kapur81 in which Gandhi is depicted overseeing Jatindranath Das and other martyrs as they line up to offer their heads to Mother India and the 1931 poster "Volley of Shafts of Non-Cooperation" by the same artist82 in which Gandhi directs the revolutionaries Bhagat Singh and Batuke shwar Dutt to fire arrows labeled "non-cooperation." Third, the range of official nationalist narratives of the freedom struggle is also more diverse and contested than has often been recognized. It is certainly true that Gandhi has been privileged in an abundance of official, state-sponsored ways: remembered as the figure most responsible for bringing about India's independence through his non-violent method in school textbooks and in a range of publications created under the auspices of the Publications Division of the Government of India, including The Gandhi Story comic book; visually presented as the Father of the Nation in the portrait-style lithographs hanging in government offices, in statues erected in towns across India, and on government-issued stamps and rupee notes; memorialized at secular pilgrimage locations and their related museums throughout India, such as Raj Ghat in Delhi, where Gandhi was cremated in 1948, and Dandi in Gujarat, where the Salt March culminated in 1930; and celebrated annually on national holidays, such as Gandhi</page><page sequence="24">314 / Karline McLain Jayanti (Gandhi's Birthday) on October 2nd and Independence Day on August 15th. But since independence in 1947, when tracts and posters and other items celebrating the acts of the revolutionaries could no longer be proscribed by the British, revolutionary figures too have received offi cial attention in the form of Publications Division-issued books, statues, and museum memorials. The exhibition titled "The Trial of Bhagat Singh" that was on display at the Supreme Court of India Museum in New Delhi 83 from September 27-December 31, 2008 is the most recent case in point. This exhibition displayed numerous artifacts connected with the life and trial of the revolutionary Bhagat Singh in cases placed throughout the exhibit space, including banned posters of Bhagat Singh and fellow revo lutionaries offering their heads to Mother India; hand grenades and bombs made by the revolutionaries; Bhagat Singh's shoes, shirt, and pocket watch; newspapers splattered with the blood of the revolutionaries; and the diary Bhagat Singh kept while in jail,84 among other items. Two dio ramas formed the focal points of the exhibit. The first displayed the trial of Bhagat Singh, using scaled-down wax dolls and an audio recording (in Hindi) to re-enact Bhagat Singh's defense speech before the British judge. The second displayed the execution of Bhagat Singh, again using scaled-down wax dolls and accompanied by a short audio recording as well as a dramatic flash of white light at the moment of the hanging. Finally, the exhibit culminated in a short film that compiled photographs of Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary colleagues together with newspaper clippings and paired them with a voiceover (in Hindi) that narrated the life and death of Bhagat Singh. Accompanying all of these visual items were large printed poster boards with text (in Hindi and English) that dictated an official, state-sponsored nationalist narrative quite unlike that in The Gandhi Story: the oppressive rule of the British, with special atten tion paid to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, characterized as a slaughter of "passive" protestors; the rise of revolutionary groups of brave young men in many regions of India in response to such colonial oppression; the heroic acts of such brave young men, including Bhagat Singh's bomb ing of the legislative assembly; the martyrdom of such men who died under the farcical system of justice that was British law; and the ultimate victory of independence. Significant in its omission was any mention of Gandhi in this state-sponsored nationalist narrative. The centerpiece poster board brought home the message of the exhibit: it was thanks to brave</page><page sequence="25">An Official Indian Comic Book History of Mahatma Gandhi / 315 people like Bhagat Singh who stood up to the injustice of the British legal system that freedom and justice were ultimately achieved in India with the independence of the country and the institution of the Constitution of India. Finally, all of these nationalist narratives—official and unofficial, state sponsored and popular, textual and visual—may diverge over the conten tious issue of the use of violence, but they converge on the body of the slain patriot. The exemplary citizen of the nation, these many narratives suggest, is the martyr. In an important essay on Mother India, Sumathi Ramaswamy demonstrates that the nation of India was repeatedly figured as a living mother goddess in multiple forms, both anthropomorphic and cartographic, in twentieth-century nationalist publications. In response to the question of what the figure of Mother India wants, she writes, "I suggest that it wants the patriotic Indian to be prepared to surrender life and limb to the Indian national territory, much in the manner of Bhagat, Gandhi, and possibly Indira. It wants martyrs for its cause."85 Once slain, whether executed by the colonial power as Bhagat Singh was or assassi nated by a fellow countryman as Gandhi was, there can no longer be any doubt about their patriotic credentials for they have made the ultimate sacrifice for the nation. Thus even Jawaharlal Nehru, a leading member of the Congress Party and a staunch supporter of Gandhian non-violence, felt compelled to visit Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionary Jatin dranath Das while they were held in Lahore Jail and were bedridden from their prolonged hunger strike in protest at their incarceration by the British.86 Jatindranath Das died as a result of this hunger strike in 1929, and the "Our Martyr Jatindranath Das"87 poster printed shortly thereafter featured Nehru presenting Jatindranath's decapitated head as an offering to Mother India as Bhagat Singh looked on in the background. In 1931, after Bhagat Singh was executed, Nehru delivered a short tribute (cited at the end of the Amar Chitra Katha comic book Bhagat Singh) in his mem ory. This tribute, which was drafted by Gandhi, stated the Congress' disapproval of political violence in any shape or form and then went on to recognize Bhagat Singh as a true patriot, saying, "I do not know how many Bhagat Singhs we may have to sacrifice before India is free. The lesson which we should learn from Bhagat Singh is to die in a manly and bold manner so that India might live."88 When Gandhi was assassinated seventeen years later, Nehru had the sad task of delivering a tribute on</page><page sequence="26">316 / Karline McLain his behalf as well, hailing Gandhi too as a martyr for the nation's freedom.

In 1998, a two-act play by Pradeep Dalvi, "Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy" (This Is Nathuram Godse Speaking), was staged in Mumbai. Based on Gopal Godse's book, this play enacts Nathuram Godse's defense plea and thereby explores the assassination of Gandhi and the trial of Nathuram Godse from Nathuram's point of view. Audience members inside the packed theater reportedly cheered when the actor playing Nathuram Godse victoriously proclaimed his reasons for assassinating Gandhi, while outside the theater hundreds of protestors demanded the cancellation of the play, which they felt denigrated Gandhi and glorified violence. Both the play and the book were banned, but con tinued to circulate underground. Also controversial is the yearly gathering in Pune on November 15, the anniversary of Nathuram Godse's execution, when his followers perform acts of worship before his portrait and his</page><page sequence="30">320 / Karline McLain shirt stained with Gandhi's blood.

Printed by Ramdas Press for Shyam Sundar Lai; see Neumayer and Schelberger, Bharat Mata: India's Freedom Movement in Popular Art (2008), p. 102. Pinney does discuss a couple of images that depict either Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru with martyred revolutionaries. He argues that such images suggest "the indebtedness of official nationalism to revolutionary terrorism"; see Pinney, "Photos of the Gods": The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India (2004), pp. 135-36. I would argue that many of these images are ambivalent. They could also be read to suggest the nation's debt to Gandhi, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Batukeshwar Dutt, Subhas Chandra Bose, and others—all to be revered together for bringing about India's freedom. 83.
