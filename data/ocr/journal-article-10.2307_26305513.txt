<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychoanalysis and Religion in the 21st Century: Competitors or Collaborators? Ed. David Black. New York: Routiedge, 2006. 278 pp. $99.00 (hb), $36.95 (pb). Say what you will about the differences between psycho analysis and religion, they are both survivors. Despite being buried time and time again by critics, they are alive and kicking at the start of the twenty-first century, perhaps in part because of the fine line both fields tread between loyalty to tradition and adaptation to an ever-changing present. The relations between the two have been in flux ever since Freud defined religion as one of the "mass delusions" of humankind (1930, 81) and claimed (1927) that its origins lay in wishful thinking. Did he pinpoint a rift so deep that no passing of time can patch it up? Or have those on both sides of the divide mellowed in their views of each other? The short answer to these questions is: it depends on whom you ask. For the long answer, try reading this book, in which fourteen scholars present "radically divergent" (15) opinions on this matter, as editor David Black writes in his introduction. Each of the essays offers interesting insights but the real fascination of the collection lies in juxtaposing the views of the writers, creat ing an internal conversation. Using an array of methodological perspectives, they discuss how (and whether) they would like to see psychoanalysis become involved with the religious sphere of life. In so doing, they shed light not only on the encounter between religion and psychoanalysis but also on the striking diversity of opinion about religion within psychoanalysis itself. Five of the authors—David Black, Rachel Blass, Jeffrey Ru bin, Kenneth Wright, and Rodney Bomford—begin by noting the changes that have taken place in the way psychoanalysis has approached religion since the 1980s, when several books (e.g., Meissner 1984; Rizzuto 1979; Spero 1980) promoting a dialogue between the two were published. This change accelerated in the 1990s when other writers (e.g., Symington 1994; Eigen 1998; Kakar 1991; Jones 2002) took up the spiritual dimension of psy choanalysis. However, the contributors vary in their appraisals of this development: whereas Blass argues that the reconciliation between psychoanalysis and religion is lamentable (23), Rubin American Imago, Vol. 65, No. 4, 616-623. © 2009 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 616</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 61V bemoans that spirituality is still not more fully integrated into mainstream psychoanalysis (132). The book is organized into four sections: the essays in the first ponder questions of religious truth; those in the second analyze religious stories from a psychological perspective; those in the third consider religious experience; and those in the fourth examine the connections between psychoanalysis and a range of religious traditions. Another way of grouping the pa pers, however, is by the questions they address and the methods they use to answer them. Viewed from this standpoint, one set of papers belongs to the field of the psychology of religion, posing such questions as "What does psychoanalysis have to say about a certain religious phenomenon or myth?" Ronald Britton's "Emancipation from the Superego: A Clinical Study of the Book of Job," for instance, casts Job as the ego and God as the crushing superego. Britton argues that the message of the Book of Job is not that God is beyond comprehension but rather that the superego-^wa-God must be put in its place and judged for being a cruel and un realistic master. Similarly, David Millar's 'The Christmas Story—A Psycho analytic Enquiry" looks first at the "myth about God becoming man" (98), then at the gospel nativity stories, and finally at Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol." Millar elaborates on these myths from a psychoanalytic perspective, reading the relationship between God and man in "A Christmas Carol" as a metaphor for the complex and evolving relationship between ego and superego. Continuing in this vein, in "Reflection on the Phenomenon of Adoration in Relationships, Both Human and Divine," Francis Grier uses clinical examples in order to clarify the concept of "adoration" both in the mother-baby dyad and in mystical traditions. Grier analyzes the complex manifestations of adoration in what is actually a triadic mother-father-baby situation to demonstrate the expression of bisexuality in the realms of religion. The second type of paper in this volume compares psycho analysis and religion from an external vantage point in order to assess the "fit" between them. The writers in this group find positive analogies between religion and psychoanalysis, often with the intention of claiming that there can and should be more room in psychoanalysis for the spiritual or religious realm.</page><page sequence="3">618 Book Reviews Michael Parsons's "Ways of Transformation" takes up the overlap between psychoanalysis and religious traditions, describ ing how both "are interested in a shift in understanding, from external to internal" (119). Both religion and analysis likewise aim to foster a deeper sense of aliveness through a process of leading one out of oneself and back again. Ultimately, both sponsor transformations in the deepest parts of the self while simultaneously helping people overcome deep-seated resistances to psychic or spiritual change. In "Psychoanalysis and Spirituality," Jeffrey Rubin writes about the ways in which psychoanalysis and religion can be mutu ally enriching. As a common ground he identifies the similarity between the analyst's "evenly hovering attention" and meditative techniques. He also points out that both psychoanalysis and religion can sanctify mundane moments of life. Rubin would like analysis to embrace a world-view of interrelatedness in the spirit of Buber's "I-Thou," which fosters hope about the human condition and a sense of the mystery of the universe. Mark Epstein's 'The Structure of No Structure: Winnicott's Concept of Unintegration and the Buddhist Notion of No-Self' shows how recent psychoanalytic writers come close to Buddhist conceptions of the nonexistent self, and how Winnicott's notions of unintegration and the False Self overlap with the Buddhist approach to overcoming narcissism. Also drawing on Eastern traditions, Malcolm Cunningham in "Vedanta and Psychoanaly sis" parallels the Vedantic concept of the super-conscious Self, which is a manifestation of the ultimate reality, and Bion's concept of "O" or the unknown thing-in-itself. He discusses three qualities—faith, courage, and reverence—necessary to spiritual growth no less than to a good analysis since both aim to widen the sense of self. Stephen Frosh's "Psychoanalysis and Judaism" speculates about the venerable designation of psychoanalysis as a 'Jewish science." His main point is that both use hermeneutics as an instrument of transformation while emphasizing the law as a necessary limitation to interpretive freedom. It would be fruit ful to compare Frosh's argument with that of Susan Kirschner in The Religious and Romantic Origins of Psychoanalysis (1996), which traces the origins of psychoanalysis mainly to mystical Christianity, as well as with Mordecai Rotenberg's Damnation and</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 619 Deviance (2003), which aligns the ethos of psychoanalysis with the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. One might plausibly conclude either that the analogies between these domains are too overdetermined to be useful or else that psychoanalysis indeed has roots in multiple religious traditions. Interestingly, none of the authors in this book mentions the "negative" attributes shared by religion and psychoanalysis, such as their hierarchical and authoritarian organizational structures, their frequent intolerance of dissenters, and their preoccupation with rituals and ceremony, as well as the arguably excessive roles they have been known to play in their disciples' lives. This line of argument abounds in more critical studies of psychoanalysis (Kirsner 2000), but doesn't find an echo in this book. A common thread linking several essays is the question of the origins of a belief in God, which is most often raised in order to assert the legitimacy of such a belief and to promote a spiri tual or religious disposition within psychoanalysis. Black's 'The Case for a Contemplative Position" proposes that religious belief originates not in the phylogenetic past of the human species, as Freud believed, but rather in vivid protoverbal experiences that lead to unverbalizable emotional knowledge, such as how wonderful it feels to love and be loved. Neville Symington's "Religion: The Guarantor of Civiliza tion" thought-provokingly addresses the origins of religion in prehistory in order to argue that it is indispensable to civiliza tion because it enhances the human capability to symbolize and to know one's own existence. If psychology were based on the capacity for representation rather than on a theory of instincts, asserts Symington, we would have a shared foundation for both religion and psychoanalysis. The analytic goal of reclaiming split-off parts of the personality would then concur with the spiritual aim of increasing love and compassion. In "Preverbal Experience and the Sacred," Kenneth Wright maintains that religion originates above all not in the Oedipus complex so thoroughly mapped by Freud but in the preoedipal terrain explored by Winnicott, Bowlby, and their successors. This shift in focus enables both religion and psychoanalysis to offer enhanced possibilities for redemption in people's lives. Complementing Wright's thesis, M. Fakhry Davids' "Render unto Caesar What Is Caesar's—Is There a Realm of God in the Mind?"</page><page sequence="5">620 Book Reviews uses clinical examples to examine representations of God from an object relations perspective. Davids shows that God can be conceived as a refuge, a guide, or an ultimate other. Whereas the first two paradigms are versions of well-known object rela tions, the third is unique and may represent the realm of God in the mind. The relations between psychoanalysis and religion are addressed most frontally in the first and last chapters, which provide a "framework dispute" for the rest of the book. In her keynote, "Beyond Illusion: Psychoanalysis and the Question of Religious Truth," Rachel Blass charges that those who claim that religion and psychoanalysis can make peace are ignoring the insuperable stumbling block of the question of God's existence. For Blass, religion can be considered a healthy phenomenon only if we define it not as faith in a supernatural being but as a generalized spirituality: either as an illusion in potential space, or as a concern for others, or as a mystical openness to experience. However, the principal concern of religion is to make assertions regarding reality and truth, as any traditional believer would agree. "Conciliation becomes possible because in this post-modern, non-realist sense of religion, there is no longer room for the concern (which troubled Freud) that religious belief is a distortion of reality" (24), writes Blass. She goes on to assert that not only Freud but most believers would properly reject this new psychoanalytic embrace of religion if they realized its price tag. This reconciliation leaves no place for organized religion or religious ritual, not to mention funda mentalism, even though that is the kind of faith many believers have held in the past and still hold today. In the final chapter, "A Simple Question?," Anglican cler gyman Rodney Bomford, the lone contributor from the side of religion, puts forward a claim that can be read as a partial rejoinder to Blass. Bomford attempts to refute Freud's convic tion that the idea of God is an absurdity by contending that there are various forms of existence, and therefore different levels of discourse about God. What causes the most difficulty for atheists are empirical judgments about what is counted as reality. Bomford states that "God does not easily fit into this level at all, for all the excellent reasons that an atheist may typically present" (255). He then proceeds to describe levels of</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 621 trans-empirical discourse, which are far more meaningful when talking about God, and presents mystical and mythical models of understanding that "are intended to dispel the notion that Christianity stands or falls by the existence of an unseen being standing outside or alongside the universe" (267). In other words, the traditional God posited by Blass is not what we should be discussing at all. When looked at as a whole, the papers point to a link between the theoretical inclination of the writer and his or her attitude towards religion and a belief in God. Those with a predominantly Freudo-Kleinian outlook tend to highlight the problematic aspects of faith. Britton, for instance, holds that belief in a God who is no more than a harsh and immoral superego "produces a particular pattern of internal submission to an alien spirit" (92). Those who write from an object rela tions stance exhibit an attitude of goodwill towards faith while bracketing the question of its ultimate reality. They analyze the psychological source of religious feelings and attribute them to manifestations of the preverbal symbiosis with the mother without directly dealing with the metaphysical implications of this explanation. According to Davids, "the question of God's existence (in external reality) lies beyond the scope of psycho analysis" (52); and for Black, "We remain in the phenomenal world and the world of noumena remains closed to us" (77). Finally, those who espouse a relational perspective embrace the mystical and spiritual components of faith, and they include among its sources not only preverbal experience but also a corresponding mystery in the universe. "If we got in touch with the sacred unconscious we would see the world as more holy" (149), affirms Rubin; and Symington concurs, "I think the present surge of inquiry into the nature of consciousness will ultimately lead us back to religion and away from an irreligious scientism" (200). Encountering such a diversity of thought about perceiv ing God, I could not help but wonder if the early analysts had not aimed at dethroning the wrong king. As Karen Armstrong writes in her History of God (1993), a subjective and internal deity might survive psychoanalysis better than the anthropomorphic being who prevails in Western folk religions but that very few theologians have ever espoused. At any rate, it seems that the</page><page sequence="7">622 Book Reviews imbroglio of psychoanalysis and religion boils down to the time less question: what does one mean when one speaks of God? This, in turn, leads to another question: should analysis weigh in on matters of theology or is it best seen as a value-free zone? Writing to Pfister on February 16, 1929, Freud managed to uphold both sides of the equation: "Analysis produces no new world-view. But it does not need one, for it rests on the gen eral scientific world-view with which the religious one remains incompatible" (Freud and Pfister 1963, 139). However, this may be one place where most of the writers in the book agree: psychoanalysis today can scarcely be seen as lacking its own set of values. Where the writers disagree is whether, and to what extent, these values should encompass the religious sphere. Rubin's claim that the horizons psychoanalysis offers its adherents could stand an improvement in terms of inspiration rings true; but even if analysis is lacking in "spirit," should the solution be to import its soul from the world of spiritual practices? One can imagine an analysand, upon receiving a dose of spiritual insight from his analyst, realizing one day that if he were to trade in the latter for an authentic teacher of Buddhism, Yoga, or Kabbala, he might come closer to the source of these insights without having to swallow the bitter pill of analysis on the side. Perhaps a better solution would be to study the world-view and values of psychoanalysis itself in order to discover how it can serve as an inspiration for human living. Blass's suggestion that truth-seeking is one core value inherent in the foundation of psychoanalysis might be a good point of departure on such a journey.
