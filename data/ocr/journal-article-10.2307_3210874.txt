<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical and archaeological sources are in agreement that several cultures coexisted in the Lev- ant during the Persian period (539-333 BCE; Laperrousaz and Lemaire 1994: 70-74). In addition to the local people, many of whom had recently returned from exile in Babylon, Phoenician, Greek and Cypriot traders inhabited-if not ruled-the coast while Persian administrators and sol- diers resided in regional centers from which they managed their western satrapy and its population. This mix of peoples resulted in a diverse material culture (for example, coastal ceramic assemblages of the period bear only a slight resemblance to central hill country assemblages) and diverse mortuary practices. Perhaps we can better identify these various social groups by means of the mortuary remains they left behind and articulate the intent behind their mortuary practices. Qj vtv Q~Q) Cl Ic pa tvJ Map showing location of Persian period burials in Palestine. Mortuary Practices in the Persian Period of the Levant Samuel R. Wolff The subject of mortuary practices in the Persian period of the Levant has not received much attention in the scholarly literature.1' The one notable exception to this is the work of Ephraim Stern who presented a pioneering study in 1982 that was abridged and partially updated in 2001 (Stern 1982: 68-92; 2001: 470-77). Stern's main interests, beyond providing a reliable and critical catalogue, were tomb typology and chronology. Today, other aspects of burial are the focus of scholarly attention, including the locaton of tombs relative to settlements, tomb typology and orientation, body position, and the analysis of skeletal remains and, of course, grave goods. Since Stern's initial study of mortuary practices in the Persian period, the evidence for mortuary practices has increased, although not dramatically. I estimate that about 250 tombs have been published altogether, a not insignificant number given that the period was one of a reduced and recovering population with a lesser number of settlements in comparison to the preceding Iron Age. There can be little doubt, however, that a significant number of tombs has yet to be discovered; the necropolises of two of the largest Persian period sites, Ashkelon and Dor, have not yet been located. And many of those discovered have yet to NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:2 (2002) 131</page><page sequence="2">,, ?. . "-., , ? t , b o .,5 .. '. . . , i .. . ? .. ..,4.  ".i .? ? . .

At Tel Michal alone, it has been estimated, correctly or not, that there are 1200 Persian period burials, of which about 150 have been excavated and published (Herzog and Levy 1999: 22*). Regarding their distribution, most tombs were found along the coast, or at coastal-oriented sites such as Tel Qiri and Tell el-Hesi. Very few were found in the central hill country, and none from the southern part of the country (where, as it happens, very few sites were found). Cemeteries or Not? Were the deceased buried in cemeteries or in isolated tombs? The answer is yes to both. To date, cemeteries, loosely defined here as a concentration of contemporary burials, have been identified at Lohamei Hageta'ot, probably Akhziv, Atlit, Tel Qiri, Hazor, Tel Michal, Tell el-Hesi, Tell Farcah (S), Tell Mazar and Tell es-Sa'idiyeh. On the other hand, isolated tombs have been excavated at Ashkelon, Tittora, Ain Arrub (near Hebron), Khirbet Ibsan (Lower Galilee), Tel Hadid, Tel Bira, and Jaffa. To be sure, future excavations might reveal additional tombs where only one has been recorded. Yet there is no doubt at Ashkelon Afridar, for example, where only one tomb was found cutting the Early Bronze Age strata, that no others existed. One may assume that the deceased who lived in larger settlements were interred in cemeteries, while those from smaller ones (farms) or travelers were buried in isolated tombs. If the estimated number of total burials at Tel Michal is even close to being correct, then one must consider the possibility that the cemetery served as a central burial ground, since that number seems too great to account for only the deceased from Tel Michal. Location of Tombs Where were the tombs/cemeteries located vis-ai-vis the settlements? It is often difficult to say whether the tombs were located within the settlements or outside their borders, since in many cases the location of the actual settlement is unknown (Tel Qiri, for example, although the cemetery is located on the edge of the tell itself). At Hazor, the cemetery was located in Area A, on the acropolis, west and south of the Iron Age six-chamber gateway. Persian period occupation was discerned in Areas B and G, located at either end of the acropolis, so one might conclude that the cemetery was near the occupied areas, but not next to them. At Lohamei Hageta'ot (Tell er-Ras), Tell el-Hesi, Tell Far'ah South and Tel Michal, the cemeteries are located near or on the slopes of tells. All of the isolated tombs were unrelated to sites. Thus, the overall impression is that an effort was made to distance the burials from the occupied areas, but not to place them very far away. This may connote a concern with family- oriented traditions, where the deceased was interred in a family, clan or tribal plot, and less a concern with territorial marking, which is characterized by outlying cemeteries. Multiple versus Individual Burials The vast majority of the pit or cist tombs contain only one individual. Occasionally two or three individuals are found (as at Tel Qiri and Atlit). When three individuals are present, they 132 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:2 (2002)</page><page sequence="3">Left: Bronze thymiaterion (incense stand) from a tomb near Shechem. Above: Silver bowl and bronze ladle from Tell el-Far'ah. These metal objects and the ceramic coffin on page 135 may be attributed to burials either of Persian administrators or soldiers or of wealthy local inhabitants returning from exile. Photos courtesy of E. Stern. consist of a male and female adult and a child, in other words, a family). Rock- cut tombs from Atlit contained one burial in the chamber; additional burials were placed in the shafts. It is impossible to determine whether these later interments belonged to the same family as the original interred, or whether they were taking advantage of a preexisting tomb to accommodate unrelated bodies. For multiple burials, the Iron Age custom of pushing aside the bones of one's ancestors in order to accommodate the latest deceased member of the family is found only at those so-called sixth century burials in the hill country (see note 1). In addition, there is one tomb at Jaffa where eight skeletons and the bones representing at least five different bodies were found in a rock-cut burial chamber. Inhumation versus Cremation Almost all of the burials from the Persian period were inhumations. At sites such as Deve Hiiyi k (Syria), the Persian period inhumation cemetery replaced the earlier Iron Age cremation cemetery, perhaps a sign of influence from Persia. Examples of cremation burials from Magen Broshi's excavations at Tel Megadim are published only in preliminary fashion. Broshi claims that both inhumation and cremation burials were found, but, as far as can be discerned, he identifies cremations on the basis of ashy deposits within a pit rather than burnt bones from a burial urn. Thus, I would tend to regard these so-called "cremation" burials with skepticism. Cremation burials from the Persian period were found at the coastal site of Tal Sukas, Syria. These should most likely be ascribed to the site's Greek population. In addition it has been claimed that one burial from Lohamei Hageta'ot (Messika 1996: 38*, Tomb 10) contained cremated human remains. This is a strange burial, however, with one charred body placed in the bottom of a pit tomb, without an urn. Perhaps the deceased was for some reason charred but not cremated, since his long bones and skull were preserved. Primary versus Secondary Burials All burials from the Persian period were primary burials. There is no indication that the Zoroastrian custom of exposing the body and later collecting the bones was practiced, nor is there any evidence of ossuaries having been employed. Burial Markers The only site where the burials seem to have massebot or tombstones is Tel Megadim, where a simple uninscribed kurkar cobble-sized stone is placed at one or both ends of a number of (three or so) tombs. These tombs were for the most part devoid of finds. They are tenuously dated by the excavator to the Persian period on the basis of Persian period pot sherds that lined the sides of the tomb. Orientation and Position of the Body A clear pattern is discerned for orientating the body on an east-west axis. This is the first time that a specific orientation prevailed in the region since the time of the nawamis (a tomb type known primarily from south Sinai comprising a rounded structure, ca. 2 m high and 3-6 m in diameter, built of undressed stones arranged in a double wall with corbelled roof) in the Early Bronze Age. Isolated examples are orientated differently, however. The head was most often placed at the eastern end of NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:2 (2002) 133</page><page sequence="4">Levantine Tomb Types in the Persian period Rock-cut Chamber Tombs The vast majority of rock- cut tombs are concentrated at sites located along the Phoenician coastal plain, including Akhziv, Lohamei Hageta'ot, Atlit and Tel Bira. Isolated examples were found at Jaffa, Palmachim, Tel Qiri, Tel Hadid and Ain Arrub. These tombs had entrances that were either stepped (dromos) or with a shaft leading to a chamber. The primarily coastal distribution of this type and the finds associated with such tombs suggests that they should be associated with Phoenician culture, although the possibility that this type is a holdover from Iron Age tradition cannot be discounted. Indeed, some Iron Age rock-cut and cave tombs continued to be used in the Persian period. Cists and Pits Stern and the excavators of Tel Michal define cist tombs as graves that were dug down, either into bedrock, sandy soil, or tell debris, and then lined or covered by mudbrick, stone or wood. Pit tombs are defined as simple pits that were not lined or roofed. These tombs were either cut into bedrock, as at Lohamei Hageta'ot, or into the earth or sand as at Tel Michal and elsewhere.

Shaft entrances to rock-cut tombs from Gesher-Ha- Ziv (Akhziv). Photo courtesy of E. Stern. Both cist and pit tombs are decidedly coastal in their distribution, but they are occasionally found in the interior as well (e.g., cist tombs at Hazor). Pit and cist tombs should be classified together since their distribution and character (orientation, finds) are so similar. Storage Jar Burials The interred was inserted into the storage jar after its base had been removed, and the jar was simply buried in the available matrix. Almost all of these jars contained infant or child burials. Examples have been found at the following sites: Tal Sukas (1), Atlit (1), Tel Michal (27: 8 basket-handled amphoras, 6 "elongated," 7 bag shaped, 1 straight 134 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:2 (2002)</page><page sequence="5">shouldered), Jaffa (1), Apollonia (I basket-handled amphora, I straight shouldered) and Tell Mazar (1). Thus, with the exception of Tell Mazar, this is a decidedly coastal phenomenon. This mode of burial is not found in the Iron Age. Burials in basket- handled storage jars have been found at Tal Sukas, Atlit, Tel Michal, and Apollonia, in Rhodes at Ialysos and Kameiros, and in Cyprus. Such a distribution suggests that this foreign burial type should be attributed to Cypriot or possibly Phoenician traders residing with their families in Levantine coastal sites. Rujms (tumuli) At the site of Yafit, located in Jordan Valley, two rujms (in Arabic literally "tower") were discovered and excavated (Magen 1985). They consist of an outer circle of stones, an inner circle, a fill of small stones between the two, and, in one of the rujms, a cist burial. The excavator dates these structures to the Persian period based on sparse associated finds. He also notes the possibility that additional rujms exist in the vicinity. These features may have functioned as burials of semi- nomads who pastured their herds in the Jordan Valley. Coffins Burial in coffins was clearly foreign to the inhabitants of ancient Israel. Burial in metal coffins, as found at Ur and elsewhere in the east, are absent in the Levant, and burials in ceramic coffins, which is the most common burial type in Persia (Haerinck 1997: 33), are rare, with individual examples having been found only -at Tell Mazar, Shechem, Jerusalem and Tell en-Nasbeh. It is reasonable to associate these coffins with Persian soldiers or administrators who died while serving in the Fifth Satrapy "beyond the river." Two stone anthropomorphic coffin lids have been found in shaft tombs at Shavei Zion and Gaza. They find numerous contemporary parallels in Phoenicia and most likely represent elite Phoenician interments (Lembke 2001). Ceramic coffin from a tomb near Shechem. Photo courtesy of E.

It is difficult to interpret such phenomena. An intriguing possibility is that those with their heads to the west reflect Egyptian influence while those with heads to the east reflect a Phoenician belief; that is, facing the sea, which represents the main focus of Phoenician economic activity. Needless to say, reused Iron Age tombs from the interior of the country are not oriented in any particular direction. Bodies are almost always found in supine position, with arms at the sides or, in certain instances, resting on the pelvic area. This contrasts with Iron Age burials where only twenty percent lay supine (Bloch-Smith 1992: 70). Crucifixion? At Lohamei Hageta'ot, the limbs of one individual were encircled by a long bronze nail. Three other nails were found in the tomb. The excavator writes that the interred "apparently incurred some form of punishment. It is not evident, however, whether this might be related to the practice of crucifixion, which was indeed already practiced in the Persian period" (Onn 1999: 62*, providing references to relevant passages in Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon). Grave Goods Generally speaking, Persian period tombs contain a minimum number of objects, if any at all. This has led to problems identifying them as Persian. At Tell es-Safidiyeh, for example, the same type of tomb was employed in the Iron I and the Persian periods. Without objects, it is impossible to date them with certainty. The one tomb with finds at Tel Qiri is dated to the Roman period; all the others were found empty or almost empty. The only exceptions to this tendency are the rock-cut burials along the Phoenician coast where more artifacts, presumably reflecting greater wealth, were found (e.g., Atlit). In most cemeteries there is no evidence for differential treatment according to the social status or wealth of the interred; there are no richer or poorer burials. It has been argued that the tombs from Tel Michal exhibit such differentiation (Herzog and Levy 1999: 22*-23*)-that is, the cist burials have richer finds than the pit burials and therefore represent burials of persons of higher wealth or status. This phenomenon has not been observed at other sites, with the exception of some tombs where high quality bronzes were found. On the other hand, the cist tombs from Hazor were not rich in finds at all. The relative lack of grave goods suggests that the artifacts were not intended to provide food or drink to the deceased for his voyage into the netherworld as in other periods. The most common burial item is a single juglet, with bronze anklets appearing less frequently. There is a coastal phenomenon (from Ashkelon in the south to Atlit in the north) of placing one or more straight-shouldered twisted handled storage jars in the tomb, often in the corners. Differentiation of grave goods between sexes has been noted, especially at Atlit. Female burials contained anklets, earrings, finger ring, kohl sticks, necklaces of beads and pendants, and mirrors, while male burials occasionally contained arrowheads. These attributions were probably made according to the excavator's expectations, however, rather than by skeletal analysis. In a few tombs (Shechem, Horvat Ibsan, Ein Hanatziv, Gezer, Beth Shemesh Tomb 14, Tell es-Safi, Tell Far'ah South Tombs 650 and 817 and Tell Mazar), high quality bronze objects were found, including bowls, censers, strainers, lamps, ladles and a thymiaterion (metal incense stand). These items stand out from the typical grave goods. Parallels are found at several Persian sites in Persia and Syria such as Tel Barsip, Ur, Persepolis, Neirab and Deve Hiiytik. These objects and the tombs in which they were found can be attributed either to Persian administrators or soldiers, or to wealthy local inhabitants returning from exile (Stem 1980: 108). If the suggestion that Iron Age tombs were reused by returning exiles or locals who never left the country is accepted, then the first possibility becomes more likely than the second. A bronze bowl was found placed over the head of an interred adult male at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Tubb 1998: 133, fig. 94). The excavator dates this burial to the Persian period but notes how difficult it was to distinguish Persian period burials from those dating to the twelfth century BCE. Parallels to this custom have been noted at Kamid el-Loz and Makmish (Tel Michal). Tubb points out that this was an Egyptian custom (1998: 131), while Lipiriski (in press) links this feature with the Greek custom of using phials, or shallow bowls, for pouring libations to the gods. Whatever the source of inspiration was for this practice in the Persian period, we note that a similar example was found in an Iron Age tomb at Tel Dover (Wolff and Golani 1998: 775). Finally, the discovery of a coin in several tombs, often in the vicinity of the skull, at Kamid el-Loz, Atlit and Makmish (Tel Michal) has led Lipiriski (in press) to suggest that a custom parallel to the Greek "Charon's obol" was practiced by the Phoenicians in the Persian period. Charon was the mythical ferryman who conveyed the shades of the departed across the river Styx, in payment for which he received an obol which was placed in the mouth of the deceased. The Character of Persian Period Burials The break with the preceding Iron Age mortuary practices is dramatic and almost total in all respects, including tomb type, grave goods, orientation of body and location of cemeteries. This shift can be explained by both Nebuchadnezzar's destructions and subsequent expulsion of the local population, and by the presence of new and different peoples, namely Persians and Phoenicians. Those inhabitants who were not exiled and the former inhabitants who returned from exile may have continued the previous Iron Age custom of burying in rock-cut shaft or cave tombs; Phoenicians were buried in rock-cut shaft, cist and pit tombs; Persians, along with their metal grave goods, in cist tombs with ceramic coffins; Phoenician and/or Cypriot children in storage jars; elite Phoenicians in stone anthropoid sarcophagi; and Greeks in cremation urns. At the risk of generalizing, I offer the following impressions of what can be gleaned regarding the social context of the population vis-fi-vis mortuary practices in the Persian period. First, these 136 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 65:2 (2002)</page><page sequence="7">practices were characterized by an overall simplicity and poverty (leaving aside those tombs with rich metal finds and anthropoid sarcophagi). This implies that the main organizing principle of the local population was kinship rather than wealth or social status. Second, since not much energy was expended in the preparation of the tombs, the burial of the deceased was not of major significance in ritual life. On the other hand, while we know little about burial rituals, a tendency towards standardization of burial practices (position and orientation of the body, grave goods, tomb types) implies an increasing formalization in ritual practices. Finally, the occurrence of single burials suggests an emphasis on the individual rather than the family or group. No in-depth study of burial practices in the subsequent Hellenistic period has been undertaken (but see Berlin, in this issue). There are indications of continuity from the Persian to the Hellenistic period; for example, the fourth/third century BCE cist tombs from Akko are identical to Persian period cist tombs and share an east-west orientation (Lieberman-Wander et al. 1999). It is clear, however, that by the Late Hellenistic period a shift occurred towards employing elaborately constructed family tombs (Berlin 1997: 32-33) or rock-cut tombs with kokhim or burial niches, in keeping with Jewish burial practices (Oren and Rappaport 1984). Note 1. This article is concerned with tombs from the modem countries of Israel and Jordan (and, to a lesser extent, Lebanon) from the fifth century to Alexander. Within this time frame it is not possible to make chronological distinctions between tombs (notwithstanding recent attempts; see e.g., Onn 1999: 60*-62*). Those hill country tombs that have been dated to the Neo- Babylonian period or to the sixth century BCE-Ketef Hinnom, et-Tur, Tell el- FiUl (all located within the borders of modern Jerusalem), Bethany, Beth Shemesh Tomb 14, and Horvat Almit-may need to be re-examined given the difficulty of dating finds from this century (Stem 2001: 340). At Horvat Almit, where seventh-century pottery forms are found together with Persian pottery, the excavators more or less averaged these two periods and come up with a sixth century date for the tomb. But it is more reasonable to assume that the late Iron Age tomb was reused during the Persian period. If this and other Iron Age tombs from the highlands were indeed reused in the Persian period, they would partially make up for the dearth of burials from that region. 2.
