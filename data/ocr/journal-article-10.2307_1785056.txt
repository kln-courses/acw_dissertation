Philadelphia: University Press 1930. 12X9 inches; 44-f-Dri] pages; illustrations Volumes I and II of the Publications of the Palestine Section of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. These two volumes, the forerunners of others, are a sample of the technical efficiency, regardlass of expense, with which the University of Pennsylvania is publishing the important archaeological results of its dig at Beth-Shan, which has been in progress since 1921. Beth-Shan, the modern Beisan, lies near the west</page><page sequence="2">asia 569 bank of the River Jordan, south of the Lake of Galilee, below sea-level, in a hot and malarious country. Since time immemorial it has been the key to the Jordan end of the great highway, extending along the valleys of Esdraelon and Jezreel, from the Mediterranean Sea to Transjordan. In crusading times its strategic importance was marked by the building of the great castle of Belvoir on the hill behind. Beth-Shan is best known to fame as the site of the Philistine Temple of Dagon, where the armour of Saul of Israel was hung up after his defeat on Mount Gilboa. For centuries before the Philistine conquest it had been an Egyptian military station, defending the Egyptian province of Palestine. Four great Pharaohs, from Thothmes III to Rameses II, built temples there, that of Thothmes being unique in form. His South Temple consisted of a Canaanite "High Place," as well as of a temple with altars. The High Place is a crudely walled sanctuary, open to the sky, containing a cone-shaped piece of basalt (a massebah), the Canaanite emblem of the local god Mekal, over which the priests poured blood libations out of a bowl found in situ. The Egyptians introduced an anthropomorphic figure of Mekal. In the words of the field director, Alan Rowe: "for the first time in the history of excavation we have discovered the transition from the representation of a god in the form of a column to his representation in human form, and also the transition from a 'High Place' to a Temple." Part II of Volume II, on the pottery found in these four temples, has, for the benefit of archaeologists working in Palestine, been published in advance of Part I, which is to contain the full publication of the temples. But enough is given in Volume I to show the great importance of the find, and to whet our appetites for more. Nine main city levels, starting with that of Thothmes III in 1500 B.c, have been discovered on the tell. At present only the latest level has been completely explored, and a cutting made through all the levels to establish their chronology. A number of graves, in what is one of the largest of the ancient cemeteries of Palestine, have been opened. The greater part ofthe work is still to be done, and the University promises a continuation of the excavations. A. C.</page></plain_text>
