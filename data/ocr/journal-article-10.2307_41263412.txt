Sixty years later Marshall Saville published articles describing a group of jade hachas or votive axes, and formulated the first defini- tion of Olmec style (Saville 1929). Saville examined the iconography of the hachas, pointing out that they portrayed "the conventional mask of a tiger, with peculiar slanting almond-like eyes, prominent canine teeth, small nostrils and an immense flaring upper lip," and speculating that they represented Tezcatlipoca, the great Aztec jaguar god (1929: 268). Matthew Stir- ling's pioneer excavations in the Gulf Coast region during the late 1930's and early i94o's established the archaeological context of Olmec civilization. A round-table conference was held in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, in 1942 to discuss the so-called Olmec prob- lem (Mayas y Olmecas 1942). A small group of men closely involved in the growing field of Olmec studies attended the talks and went on record in support of the antiquity of Olmec culture. They also offered an im- portant definition of the Olmec cultural tradition. Since then our knowledge of Mexico's most ancient civilization has steadily increased. New sites have been discovered and old sites re-excavated using the most modern archaeological techniques. And all the while a steady stream of fine examples of Olmec art has been pouring into museums and private collections around the world. Most archaeologists now believe that Olmec civi- lization first took shape along the Mexican Gulf coast, perhaps in the Tuxtla mountains, sometime before 1200 B.C. Three great ceremonial centers have been discovered in the Olmec heartland region: San Lo- renzo, La Venta, and Tres Zapotes. San Lorenzo stands near the beginning of the Olmec sequence and Tres Zapotes marks its termination. These centers must have been the focal points of a far-flung empire based on trade and tribute (Coe 1965a and c; 1968a). Rub- ber, chocolate, bird feathers, and other tropical com- modities were traded inland in exchange for precious jade. Colonial Olmec sites existed in the present Mexi- can states of Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla, and in the Valley of Mexico; Olmec art objects have been found from the Mexican highlands southward to Costa Rica.1 Olmec iconography has been a controversial sub- ject since Melgar first announced that the Colossal Head of Hueyapan represented a portrait of a great Negro potentate. Major contributions to the field have been made by Saville (1929), Drucker (1952), and most of all by Miguel Covarrubias (1942, 1944, 1946, 1 For general views of Olmec civilization see Bernal 1968a and b, and Coe 1968a. 5</page><page sequence="6">I947&gt; l9Sl)' Covarrubias in particular believed that the concept of the were-jaguar - a half-man and half- jaguar creature - was at the heart of Olmec iconog- raphy. By drawing a sort of genealogical chart con- necting the Olmec were-jaguars with the rain gods of later Mesoamerican cultures, Covarrubias was able to argue that the chief Olmec god was a rain deity. It is a credit to his reputation and genius that his ideas have prevailed up to the present day. In more recent times Michael Coe has published important works dealing with Olmec style and iconography (Coe 1965a and c; 1968a). A particularly interesting book has appeared in which Coe claims to have identified six distinct Olmec gods (1968a: 111-15). Unfortunately, the na- ture of the publication did not permit an exhaustive analysis of these identifications. The material presented in the following pages corroborates and expands Coe's hypothesis. Thousands of Olmec art works have survived the natural ravages of time and tropical climate and the peculiar Olmec penchant for monument smashing, and await iconographic analysis. However, major dif- ficulties surround the availability of this material. Many of the finest examples of Olmec portable art are in the hands of private collectors and can generally be seen only when they are lent to museums for special exhibitions. Since most of these objects are acquired from professional pot-hunters who pillage sites with total disregard for archaeological context, it is usually impossible to discover the stratigraphic position or exact geographical provenience of any piece. Pub- lished descriptions of Olmec art works are often of little use to the iconographer. Photographs tend to be either dingy or uninformatively artistic, and the tech- nique of line drawing, surely the most suitable method of describing iconographic detail, is only rarely uti- lized. To my knowledge no one has ever attempted to formulate a methodological approach to the study of the Olmec symbolic system. It seems to me that there are three steps involved in deciphering Olmec iconog- raphy. By breaking down Olmec representations into their component parts, it is possible to isolate the basic characters or elemental units of Olmec art. The first task of the iconographer is to compile a dictionary of these symbols, an alphabet of Olmec motifs. The sec- ond step in the deciphering process is the recognition of motif combinations and character complexes which frequently recur in Olmec art. Thus one learns that flame eyebrows usually accompany L-shaped eyes, that forehead bands are associated with toothless in- fants. In this way one can eventually identify but not define the major Olmec deities. The discontinuity be- tween identification and definition is unavoidable be- cause of the virtual absence of Olmec inscriptions. It is only in the third and final stage, when Olmec iconog- raphy has been related to the symbolic systems of later Mesoamerican cultures and when it has been firmly anchored in the literature, that proper meaning and definition can be given to the Olmec gods, and that the mythological context in which they moved can be re- constructed. This paper is concerned only with the first two stages of the deciphering process and will deal with them at considerable length. A dictionary of Olmec motifs and symbols can be found in the second section. The third section is devoted exclusively to the identifi- cation of ten gods from the Olmec pantheon. The final section contains brief speculative statements on the meaning of Olmec mythology. 6</page><page sequence="7">A Dictionary of Olmec Motifs and Symbols The 182 motifs included in this section, each designated by an arabic numeral, are given verbal and graphic descriptions wherever possible.

Each deity is labeled with a Roman numeral; variations are designated by small letters. A coded list of the motifs and symbols occurring in the representation appears after each description. GOD I. This god is a jaguar monster and the most often depicted deity in Olmec art. His primary defining characteristic is flame eyebrows; other prominent features are L- or trough-shaped eyes, pug nose, rectangular lip markings, gum brackets, and absent lower jaw. The Jaguar-Dragon Paw- Wing motif complex in its various ramifications is also associated with this divinity. The eighty-odd representations of God I are divided into seven categories. God I-A. Images of God I which are closely related to the Atlihuayan Figure are in- cluded in this subgroup. Generally they are characterized by flame eyebrows, Type A or b eyes, flattened nose, rectangular lip markings, gum brackets, and the Jaguar-Dragon Paw-Wing motif. Many lack lower jaws. Figure 90. Clay figure from Atlihuayan, Morelos. The clay sculpture represents a seated corpulent boy with flame eye- brows and typical Olmec nose and mouth. Spreading over his back is the full pelt of the fantastic creature I have called God I. The deity has Type A flame eyebrows and eyes and a small pug nose at the end of the snout. The wide-open mouth contains bracket-shaped gum markings. The monster has four paw-wings and a wide, layered tail; his skin is decorated with three different bracket motifs. (The relationship be- tween the Atlihuayan figure and the jaguar-dragon-paw- wing motif is suggested in Pina Chan i960.) Redrawn and corrected from Covarrubias 1957, Fig. 21.

The first has Type A flame eyebrows and eye and an open mouth contain- ing a single egg-tooth. The spotted body has three-toed paws and a ropelike tail. The second representation is slightly smaller than the first but shares many characteristics - Type A flame eyebrows and eye, small pug nose, egg-tooth, and curled tail.

Motifs: 40, 105, 119, 182c. Figure 135. Sello from Tlatilco. Jose Luis Franco and David Kelley have hypothesized that this sello is a text made up of three glyphic elements (Franco 1959 and Kelley 1966). My feeling is that the three glyphs are different images of God I. The right panel contains a cleft-headed were-jaguar profile with Type f flame eyebrows, Type c eye, and open mouth with single egg-tooth. Note the three-fold occurrence of the oval form, once near the creature's cleft and twice within brackets. A four-petaled flower, perhaps a Kin glyph with the symbolic value of day or sun, occupies the middle section. The left panel bears a four-dot-and-bar motif enclosed in a cleft frame. This is surely a geometric version of the profile in the right panel, for the rare Type f flame eyebrows are re- peated in both instances. Frederick V. Field.

This well-known carving depicts an elaborately dressed Olmec personage seat- ed at the mouth of a cavelike niche. That the niche is the mouth of God I can be proven by referring to Figure 141. A vertical line drawn down that relief at a point just to the left of the nose produces a section of the face which is almost identical to the niche in Relief 1. In Relief 1, God I has Type b flame eyebrows and a Type E eye with crossed bands in the iris. The jaws terminate in two cleft fang motifs, and vegeta- tion symbols sprout from the corners of the mouth. The seated Olmec personage carries an elaborate ceremonial bar which probably symbolizes God IV. The figure, which may be either male or female, wears ritual dress consisting of a feathered headdress decorated with Motif 129, and a cape and skirt again bearing Motif 129. (Coe has privately suggested that the seated figure is a female because of its long hair and skirt. However, the seated male figure in Figure 150 wears a similar skirt or kilt. The exact sex of Olmec representations is often difficult to establish.) From the mouth of the deity come great clouds of mist or smoke or incense. Three rain clouds hover over the scene and pour raindrops down upon it. Repeated four times in the carving is the precious jade- water motif. Coe 1965a, Fig. 10. (Coe 1965a, Fig. 10.)

Figure 146. Pottery vessel from Tlapacoya. Certainly one of the most complicated examples of Olmec iconographic rep- resentation, the incising on this vessel is a veritable hymn to God I. The main figure is a profile face, facing to the left and framed in a series of double-line breaks. The deity has a cleft head, Type h flame eyebrows and a large Type d eye. The nose is directly above the long hornlike projection extending out from the upper jaw. The fangless mouth is wide open; from the chin grows a banded three-pronged vegetation ele- ment. Decorating the face of this main figure are four sub- sidiary representations. In the forehead region is a front view of a monster with Type b flame eyebrows and eyes. Drooping down over his typical Olmec mouth are two figure-eight elements which originate in the nostrils. A second divinity, probably God X, appears just below the nostril of the main figure. He has a cleft head, Type D eyes, and two nostril openings. The third and fourth subsidiary representations are shown back-to-back in the lower part of the main figure's face. The left profile has a cleft head, Type b flame eyebrows and eye, a rounded nose, and open toothless mouth. Note the figure-eight element in the nostril and five-dot motif on the forehead. The right profile is identical except for the three- pronged vegetation which sprouts from the chin. To the left of the main figure are various bracket and cleft motifs. PDJ.

Occupying the bottom panel is a frontal view of God I with Type A flame eyebrows, Type b eyes, flaring nose, and mouth with two upper fangs. Motif 34, which is probably derived from the flame-eyebrow motif, decorates the creature's cheeks. The upper section may depict vegetation growing out of the body of the deity, but it should be pointed out that what is here called vegetation is identical to an inverted version of Motif 113.

The image of an Olmec ritual figure is the main component of this design. The figure's headdress, which consists of a brim with crossed- bands motif and a crown of sprouting vegetation, is of partic- ular interest. The Type f eye of God I with crossed-bands motif in the iris and Type e flame eyebrows appear in front of the vegetation sprout. To the left of the crown is a curious three-part motif, perhaps related to Motifs 95 or 130, which may symbolize vegetation. Finally, in front of the figure's open mouth is an oval speech element. The panels above and below the ritual figure are difficult to interpret; I propose that they represent an Olmec deity, possibly God I himself, with wide-open mouth. The cleft headdress, trough-shaped eyes and rounded nostrils of the god are shown in the top section. The lower panel is then the bottom part of the monster's mouth with St. Andrew's cross. In the center of the crossed-bands motif is a simple front-on view of a cleft- headed god with Type b flame eyebrows, crescent-shaped eyes, and a double-step motif symbolizing nostrils. PDJ.

The celt and its companion piece, Figure 182, are of particular interest because they seem to hold the key to the true meaning of the four-dots-and-bar motif. Figure 181 shows a tripartite maize symbol sprouting from the top of a four-dots-and-bar motif. The composition is framed in a bracket with two cleft ends and a third cleft element at its base. We know that God II can possess certain attributes of God I, particularly that deity's flame eyebrows. (See Figures 171, 172, 176, 177, 180, and 184.) In fact, God II can sometimes be distinguished from God I only by the vegetation sprouting from his cleft head. We also know that one of the eight occurrences of the four- dots-and-bar motif is in direct association with God I (see Figure 135). Therefore, it is not totally unwarranted to sug- gest that the four-dots-and-bar motif is an abstract representa- tion of God I. Figure 181 then depicts maize sprouting from the head of God I and should be considered an example of God II. Drucker 1952, Fig. 47b. Motifs: 3, 21, 26, 30, 81, 89, 95?&gt; 137, 139, 182B.

The infant figure is severely damaged but does not seem to have the attributes of God IV. However, since we have encountered a similar theme in other representations where the infant could be positively identified (Figures 206 and 208), it seems likely that this little fellow is the same deity. The seated figure wears an elaborate conical hat, ear plugs, and a pectoral or mirror around his neck. A plaque containing the face of an unidentified Olmec god, a group of three pendant dot motifs, and two crossed- bands symbols decorate the hatband.

In the first section a model to formulate a methodology for studying the Olmec iconographic system was used. By applying that model to a large sample of Olmec art it was pos- sible to compile a substantial dictionary of motifs and symbols and to identify ten major gods in the Olmec pantheon. The preceding sections have emphasized a bare analytic approach to Olmec religion, but it is not sufficient to enumerate endlessly the attributes of the ancient ones. In this final section I am allowing myself the luxury of speculating on the nature and content of the Olmec religion. Following are some tentative at- tributions I have made and present briefly for the reader's enjoyment and possible edification, with the full understanding that such speculation is at best pre- mature and at worst a waste of time. The most important deity of the Olmec pantheon is the jaguar-dragon, God I. His flame eyebrows desig- nate him lord of fire and heat. In one aspect he is god of the blazing sun or perhaps a prototype of the Xiuh- coatl who bore the sun across the sky. He is sometimes represented with vegetation springing from his body and thus is lord of the fiery earth, associated with vol- canoes and caves, drought and fertility. He is probably also god of the household hearth which stood at the center of the Olmec family. In the terms of Aztec myth, God I is Cipactli, Xiuhcoatl, Xiuhtecuhtli, and Huehueteotl all in one. God II has corn motifs sprouting from his cleft head, and must be the Olmec maize god. That he has attri- butes of God I is not surprising since that deity is lord 90 of the fertile earth. God II is surely the ancestor of such Aztec corn gods as Centeotl. The flame features of God III indicate a close rela- tionship between the avian monster and God I. He was the messenger or perhaps the harbinger of the great fire deity. God IV is the rain god once thought to be the chief divinity of the Olmec culture. He is always depicted as an infant or dwarf. The association of a human infant with rain recalls the an- nual sacrifice of little children to the god Tlaloc among the Aztec; Sahagun tells us that the more they cried, the more auspicious the sacrifice. A clearcut case of sympathetic magic, the tears of the hapless children called down the tears of the heavenly cumulus clouds. (Coe 1965a: 14) It should also be pointed out that the representatives of the Chacs and Tlalocs of later Mesoamerican cultures were dwarfs and gnomes. Images of God V combine characteristics of the rain deity and the fire monster. He is the god of lightning and lord of thunder. The band passing through the eye of God VI identi- fies the deity as the god of spring, renewal, and resur- rection, the gruesome Xipe Totec of Aztec times. God VII is the precious feathered serpent - lord of life and wisdom, god of the wind, and the primary deity of Mesoamerican ruling classes. He is Quetzal- coatl. The closed, crescent-shaped eye and fleshless jaw of God VIII define him as the lord of death and ruler of the underworld. The Aztecs called him Mictlante- cuhtli.</page><page sequence="91">Gods IX and X remain inscrutable. If speculation about the nature of the Olmec gods is premature, attempting to reconstruct their mythology is foolhardy. Yet the corpus of monuments seems to afford us a glimpse into the realms of ancient Mexican myth. The Olmec apparently believed that their rain god resided in a watery paradise deep inside the earth for certain parts of the year. On particular ceremonial occasions, probably connected with the agricultural cycle, Olmec ritual leaders descended into the bowels of the fiery earth monster to fetch the rain god and bring him back into the world of men. Such a cere- mony may have marked the beginning of the Mexican rainy season and was almost certainly accompanied by the sacrifice of infants and small children. The series of stone monuments which depict a seated Olmec adult emerging from the cavelike mouth of the earth mon- ster with the rain god in his arms commemorates this ritual (Figs. 142, 206, 209, 210). There is much that remains to be done before we can offer a valid reconstruction of Olmec ritual and mythology. The search for new examples of Olmec art must continue, and the new information must be used to refine, expand, and destroy, if necessary, the categories which have been established in this paper. Someday, it will be possible to integrate Olmec ico- nography into a general framework of Mesoamerican representational systems. 9i</page><page sequence="92">Bibliography Anton, Ferdinand and Frederick J.
