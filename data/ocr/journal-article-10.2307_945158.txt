Some of her letters to him are uncomprehending, even cruel: she tells him that she's glad he's so old, otherwise her husband would forbid the corres- pondence; she reproaches him for his treatment of his wife. But what could have become the tragi-comedy of an old man making a fool of himself over a woman unworthy of his interest is redeemed and made genuinely beautiful by his recognition of a soul that she hardly knew that she had, and by her confused, rare but moving responses to this. I've not known anything else I've not longed for anything else my life just went by without love and joy. But I always went along with the thought that that's the way it had to be. Now I think that God was testing you and me and when he saw that we've been good and that we deserve it he has granted us this joy in life. If you told anyone he wouldn't believe that I've perhaps waited for you that all my life I'd found no one who would offer me his love. I steered clear of everything I didn't look for anything and you were the only one in all the years you've known me and that really is the truth. In more than one sense Janacek 'composed' Kamila. It was the artist who had perceived the soul of the seemingly icy and egocentric Elena Makropoulos who reached out to Kamila St6sslova's ('my soul' was his favourite way of addressing her). In these letters we come very dose to the sensibility that made him a great composer. Dr. Tyrell's lucid translation and his linking text turn the book also into a most touching and compelling love-story. During his last two years Janacek wrote to Kamila almost daily. He also kept an album, a commonplace-book of thoughts and brief musical compositions, intended as a keepsake for her when they were apart (it is as yet unpublished). Its penultimate entry, before the onset of his last illness, reads: And I kissed you. And you are sitting beside me and I am happy and at peace, In such a way do the days pass for the angels. Michael Oliver Francis Poulenc by Wilfrid Mellers. O.U.P. Oxford Studies of Composers, ?25.00 (hardback). There are aspects of this book which might almost excuse one coining the monstrous pun, 'Les Mellers perpetuels'. For present are such familiar ingredients of the Mellers style as the author's enthusiasm for anthropomorphic descrip- tions of key functions; psycho-ritual contexts (locating the music within its anthropological environment - in particular, relating its content to a perceived ritualistic significance); and some curious, perhaps even eccentric critical interpret- ations. The trouble is, as this Poulenc study demonstrates, that the Mellers strategy can seem to suit some subjects less effectively than others. Here, it might partly be because of a problem of scale; a longer length might have allowed him to develop a more widely-drawn context that would have illuminated his analysis of individual works. But all too often these descriptions seem almost perfunctory, and in only a few cases does the familiar acuity shine through. This is more than a pity, for as Mellers declares in his preface, the motive in writing this short monograph was 'an act of love'. It is a beau geste of an appropriately Poulencian sort, and I am sorry that I came away from the experience with hardly any relishment. Meller's thesis about Poulenc is most clearly gathered in the concluding chapter. Under Satie's influence, Poulenc the youth achieved small acts of child-like transcendence, while in his middle years he wrote conservative music which yet contained 'new truths within accredited conven- tion'. But the theme of the major works of his last decade was 'transcendence in the specifically religious sense'. The opening chapter sets a specifically Satiean context. Here, it would seem, the concern is to establish the centrality of Satie for Poulenc, rather as an aesthetic lodestone to which the composer would always return: the reasons for Poulenc's durability. . . are inseparable from the fact that he, while still a boy, recognized as did no other Parisian composer what Satie's music was 'about'. The recognition was not conscious; Francis simply knew that Satie must be a father-figure to him... Earlier, Mellers describes Satie's music as 'Child- like but not childish... unusually free of the detritus of sentiment, and of memory and desire - and therefore of past and future'. But Poulenc's music is essentially about the act of memory, and so is inextricably bound up with what that implies in terms of sentiment. Unleashed, such sentiment certainly produced indulgent moments, but Poulenc's oeuvre is saved by a balance of extremes that can be explained in terms of the dichotomic nature of the composer's personality. Poulenc expressed himself as 'Janus- Poulenc' through some instructive oppositions, such as the painters Mantegna and Zurbaran, portraits of himself by Cocteau and Berard, and in his own music, by setting the entertainment Le Bal masque' against the Stabat Mater. Satie represented an obvious corrective at the austerity</page><page sequence="2">34 Book Reviews end of the aesthetic continuum, as well as a model for the inscrutability of Poulenc's early cycle, Le Bestiaire. However, it is because Poulenc's artistic personality is so strongly egocentric, unlike Satie's, that Satie's music could only be a goad and not a goal to the younger man, not matter what he may have thought at the outset. Le Bestiaire was essentially a means to an end, and to argue as Mellers does that it represents an ideal to which Poulenc 'remained faithful for the rest of his life', is surely to overstate the case. The form in which the Parade aesthetic took deeper root in Poulenc's psyche was as expounded in Cocteau's Le Coq et l'Arlequin, which epitomizes Le Bal masque more surely than anything that Satie wrote. Indeed, for an assessment of Poulenc's achievement, one consideration would be as to how far he achieved an authentic musical personality, independent of Satie. There are aspects of Poulenc's style and practice which, curiously, are left undiscussed, and their omission prevents this book from presenting a convincing stylistic overview of the composer. For example, while Mellers makes great play with individual tonal relationships within pieces, there is no theory which places the practice within a wider perspective. Although Mellers talks of Poulenc's skill as a pianist, he does not refer to Poulenc's invariable habit of composing at the keyboard and so does not explore the implications of that practice for the music as a whole. Time and time again in Poulenc's music, particular patterns of figuration and harmonic sequences recur, inviting the question as to whether the composer's keyboard fluency was in actuality an artistic constraint. This in turn raises the consideration whether or not self-quotation (as distinct from stylistic borrowing) is a significant issue in Poulenc's music, or a mirror of the way it was generated. Another practice to which Mellers does not refer, is Poulenc's habit of accumulating some of his songs line by line as the music occurred to him, which was not necessarily in their ordered sequence. There is an explicit reference to this in relation to 'Montpamasse' in the Journal de mes melodies, when Poulenc makes the important statement that he never transposed these particles. This helps to explain the functional and artistic significance of the modulating passages in so many songs, on which depend the connexion between individual components. It is perhaps surprising that Mellers doesn't make more of a case for Poulenc being arguably a better composer than he is sometimes represented. The Concert champetre is labelled as constructed on the principle of collage, yet the generation across the work of motives that can be categorized under three archetypes, and a process of discarding towards the climax of the Finale, is more systematic than the collage label suggests - and very much closer to Stravinskian partitioning, the model Poulenc undoubtedly had in mind. Mellers is also curiously reticent about the qualities of the Organ Concerto, which again has a detailed network of motivic correspondences, providing a stable basis for its improvisatory foreground and abrupt mood changes. Much more convincing is his extended and perceptive discussion of the Dialogues des Carmelites and the song cycle, Tel jour, telle nuit. But Mellers disclaims any intention of presenting a critical evaluation about the works he discusses (all of which, by their inclusion, strike him as 'good'), because of his love for them. This is a pity, because the writing lacks a certain sharpness that might well have accompanied a more conscious testing of the music's qualities. Perhaps the most puzzling thing about Mellers's approach is the significant lack of a biographical context. Again, a shortage of space is almost certainly to blame, but that given to the Prelude, which is about Satie, could have been more usefully deployed in a biographical outline. Perhaps more than with most composers, the character of Poulenc's music is inseparable from the character of the man. The fact that Poulenc was notoriously prone to depression itself offers a clue to the several varieties of the sudden musical clouds which fall on otherwise sunny passages. Mellers does identify the crisis of passion which, combined with the anxieties of composing the Dialogues, nearly broke the composer. But he doesn't identify the conjunction of Poulenc's homosexuality and his devout Roman Catholicism as a possibly continuous form of tension. Readers may be surprised that there is not some sustained consideration given to Poulenc's stylistic eclectisim, and the artistic implications of this aspect, which Constant Lambert used disdainfully to characterize as 'time travelling'. This charactistic of Poulenc's music used to fuel some of the most vociferous diatribes against him, but in these Postmodern times, quotation simply is no longer seen to be an issue. So from our current perspective, there is a certain triumphal glint in Mellers tweaking the Satie- Poulenc axis. For these two composers, so long despised by a musical majority, have come, at last, into their own. Satie, of course in a much grander, more original fashion as the bulwark of Experimental music; but, with hindsight, Poulenc might almost be presented as a prophet of the Postmodern. One of the most extraordinary</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 35 photographs of Poulenc is as a young man, posing with Schoenberg. Perhaps it is that improbable pairing which prompts the idea of a title to highlight our postmodern situation: what about an article proclaiming, 'Poulenc the Progressive?. David Wright The Goossens: A Musical Century by Carole Rosen. Andre Deutsch, ?20.00. Although this book is the story of a musical dynasty which included three leading instru- mentalists with long careers - Leon Goossens, oboe, and his sisters Marie and Sidonie, harpists - its publication was timed to celebrate the centenary of Sir Eugene Goossens, conductor and composer, who died in 1962. The Goossens centenary was an enormous missed opportunity, for it spawned no far-reaching reassessment of him as a composer (indeed no assessment at all that I can see), and without this book there would have been only passing reappraisal of him as a performer. I was astonished to be asked by a BBC producer if Goossens was worth considering as a composer: how he has dropped from the awareness of the musical world! Certainly the BBC Goossens centenary programmes last autumn emphasized his career as a conductor rather than making a case for his own music. Here Carole Rosen has done the family proud, and at length, in a book of over 540 pages. By allocating alternating chapters to different members of the family she has used the counterpoint of their lives, all at the top of their profession, to create a wide-spanning canvas of the musical life of the time and a history of, particularly, British music over an amazing half-century of achievement. The early 1920s saw Goossens assuming an important role in London, becoming the champion of the new music, presenting The Rite of Spring and making it an accepted concert work. After the first London concert performance of the work at Queen's Hall on 7 June 1921, Ms Rosen tells us, it received unanimous praise from the critics. This performance was followed by a repeat of Le Sacre a fortnight later and led on to four celebrated 'Goossens Orchestral Concerts of contemporary music' in the last quarter of 1921. The first and last were noted for the performances of fanfares by all the leading composers of the day published in the new (and short-lived) journal Fanfare. When revived by Leslie Head in 1979 they were found to be a wonderfully varied appetiser for a concert, like tasting all the sauces separately. (Ms Rosen is surely incorrect in saying Fanfare was edited by Philip Heseltine and Leigh Henry: not only is Heseltine not mentioned on any of my admittedly incomplete set, but Heseltine - as 'Mortimer Cattley' - had only recently crossed swords with Leigh Henry in the columns of The Musical Times over Henry's article on Stravinsky.) In the 1920s and 1930s a number of leading British musical personalities took posts overseas, especially in the USA, and if, say, Adrian Boult had accepted the US invitation he received in 1923 rather than going to Birmingham, the history of music in the UK would have been very different. Eugene Goossens did accept, going to Rochester, New York, and then Cincinnati. He lived in the USA for nearly a quarter of a century, followed by nine years in Australia, only returning to the UK after the celebrated pornography scandal in 1956. He thus had a towering reputation overseas for much of his lifetime but never established the same kind of enduring reputation as a composer, even with the British musical public, and was soon forgotten. The Oboe Concerto, the one work that remained comparatively well-known, lacked the kind of memorable individuality to establish him as a distinctive musical personality in the public mind. When, for example, his Three Pictures for Flute, Strings and Percussion, with its distinctive use of tubular bells, had its first UK performance at a 1947 Prom, it made absolutely no lasting impact.
