High-Speed Grinding and Abrasive Machining. Richard A. Dahlin, Norton Co. High-speed grinding and abrasive machining in cylin- drical grinding has recently stimulated a vast amount of interest. The characteristics of these types of grinding are discussed in detail. The grinding forces, the grinding fluid and its application, the effect of grinding variables on productivity, and the importance of work speed and wheel balance are considered. Machine requirements for higher wheel speed appli- cations such as machine dynamics, safety, and wheel dressing methods have been identified. Solutions to meet these requirements are presented. Finally, applications and grinding results for abrasive machining are offered for process consideration. 1971 SAE Transactions 710002. Adaptive Control and Automobile Manufacture. Fred Froberg, The Valeron Corp. The paper discusses two general definitions of adaptive control in an attempt to determine whether adaptive controls can effectively be employed in low-cost, high- quality auto production. Uses of adaptive control in various industries are described. Future applications are described. Future applications are suggested in auto manufacture. Solid- state circuitry and computer control are major areas of such adaptive control application which are explored. 710003. Technological Morality and the Automotive En- gineer. P. S. Myers, University of Wisconsin. The roles and responsibilities in this era of technological morality raise questions concerning active participation of engineers in ordinary day-to-day problems. Items of current interest, such as waste disposal, summer "brown- outs," locations of powerplants and their possible det- rimental effects on ecology, are discussed; the feasibility of providing qualified group judgment on national policy is shown; the ways and means of publicizing the overall problems are presented. 710004. Pollution Control Through Mass Transit: Prelude to a Quality Environment. Richard E. Marland, U. S. Public Health Service. The destruction of our environment by pollution is now everyone's concern, and the automobile run on fossil fuel is recognized as a principal source of pollution. The need for adequate public transportation emphasized by the death, disease, destruction of life and natural resources, and contribution to the waste problem wrought by the increasing numbers of private automobiles on our high- ways and city streets is balanced against the individual's need for privacy, which is at least partially fulfilled by operating his own automobile. Smaller, safer, nonpolluting cars must be designed and made available and a safe, efficient system of public transportation must be constructed, in order to ensure that the quality of life deteriorates no further than it already has. 710005. Educating the Engineer for Society. J. G. G. Hempson and M. H. Howarth, G. Coussons, Ltd., England. Introducing the direct study of environmental problems into university courses seems too difficult. The only practical way of alerting future engineers to their respon- sibility in considering the effect of their activities on the environment is indirectly. The development of courses in instrumentation and the use of experimental equipment are effective and do not require substantial modification of an engineering curriculum. The intention of this paper is to describe certain experimental work to illustrate their use in the field of environmental problems. 710006. The Engineer and Man's Environment - Aca- deme's Response to the Challenge. Gerhard Reethof, The Pennsylvania State University. The increasing levels of affluence in the highly indus- trialized Western societies have resulted in a drastic and increasing deterioration of the quality of man's envi- ronment. The economic facts in these societies are such that it actually "pays to pollute." Air and water pollution, solid waste disposal and noise pollution have become areas of major concern for the institutions of higher learning. Through instruction and research, knowledge toward the alleviation and control of environmental pollution must be disseminated and advanced. One of the major contributors to the present state of environmental deterioration is the almost absolute lack of well defined control criteria. Much needs to be done in this area and the academic community has the know-how and eco- nomic remoteness to tackle this problem. One of the most fascinating facets of the environ- mental pollution problem is its interdisciplinary nature. In this paper, the Pennsylvania State University's Programs on air pollution, water pollution, solid waste disposal and noise control are described and discussed. 710007. Some Implications of Environmental Issues for Engineering Education. Kenneth W. Ragland, University of Wisconsin. While it is recognized that man's technological demands are degrading the earth's biosphere, there is little agree- ment on what to do about it. What part has engineering played in all this? Is the answer an "ecological ethic" and if so, how can it be developed? A discussion of these dilemmas and the role the university can play in developing educational programs involving both the natural and life sciences to establish an ecological ethic and help resolve some of the major environmental problems is presented. The paper also explores how these programs can be made part of an engineer's education. 710008. Effects of Charge Dilution on Nitric Oxide Emission from a Single-Cylinder Engine. J. D. 67</page><page sequence="3">710009-710012 68 Benson and R. F. Stebar, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The effects of charge dilution on the exhaust emission of nitric oxide (NO) from a single-cylinder engine were evaluated over a range of engine design and operating parameters. Nitric oxide emission decreased as much as 70% as charge dilution fraction (volume fraction of product gases in the combustion chamber prior to ignition) was increased from 0.065 to 0.164 due to increased valve overlap, external exhaust recirculation, and reduced compression ratio. With these three variables, NO emis- sion was strongly dependent on charge dilution fraction, but was independent of the specific method used to change charge dilution. Other variables such as valve overlap position, spark timing, and exhaust pressure also affected charge dilution and NO emission, but the relationship between charge dilution fraction and NO emission for these variables was not consistent.

Why Intake Charge Dilution Decreases Nitric Oxide Emission from Spark Ignition Engines. Ather A. Quader, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This study was undertaken to develop a better under- standing of how intake charge dilution by various gases affected nitric oxide (NO) emission from a single cylinder spark ignition engine. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, argon, steam, and exhaust gas were individually added to the intake charge of a propane-fueled, single cylinder engine operated at constant speed and load. Nitric oxide emission was reduced in all cases. The gases with higher specific heats gave larger NO reductions. The product of diluent flow rate and specific heat correlated with NO reduction. The effects of diluents on calculated combus- tion temperature, MBT spark timing, and fuel consump- tion are also presented and discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710010. Heat Capacity Changes Predict Nitrogen Oxides Reduction by Exhaust Gas Recirculation. S. Ohigashi, University of Kyoto; and H. Kuroda, Y. Nakajima, Y. Hayashi and K. Sugihara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Earlier work has demonstrated that exhaust gas recir- culation (EGR) decreases peak combustion temperature and thus reduced the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOJ in spark ignition engine exhaust. The present authors hypothesized that NOx formation is primarily affected by the heat capacity of the combustion gases and recycled exhaust. The hypothesis was tested in an experimental program involving the admission of inert gases such as He, Ar, H2, and C02, and water in place of EGR. In addition to confirming the validity of the original hypothesis, the test data also indicated that engine output and efficiency were significantly affected by the heat capacity of the combustion gases. The authors conclude that EGR functions by increasing the heat capacity of the working fluid, and demonstrates that the correlative changes in NOx and engine performance can be predicted from heat capacity considerations. These studies, together with further work on combustion pressures, should be useful in evaluating various NÖX control techniques. Discussion: S.

John B. Heywood, Steven M. Mathews and Barbara Owen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A theoretical model which predicts exhaust nitric oxide concentrations in a spark-ignition engine is described. The essential features of the model are a kinetic scheme for nitric oxide formation and a thermodynamic analysis of the burnt and unburnt gases during and after combustion. Predictions are compared with exhaust nitric oxide concentrations measured on single-cylinder CFR engines. For fuel-lean and stoichiometric mixtures, predictions are within a factor of 2 below the experimentally measured values. The discrepancy for fuel-rich mixtures increases to about an order of magnitude at an equivalence ratio of 1.4. The effects of uncertainty in kinetic rate constants, temperature predictions, cycle-to-cycle variations, and burnt gas mixing on the model are explored. 710012. The Effect of Fuel Composition, Equivalence Ratio, and Mixture Temperature on Exhaust Emissions. R. D. Fleming and D. B. Eccleston, Bureau of Mines, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. A single-cylinder research engine was operated on pure hydrocarbons and simple mixtures of pure hydrocarbons to study the effect of fuel composition, equivalence ratio, and mixture temperature on exhaust emissions. Used as fuel components were hydrocarbons-rt-pentane, 2- methyl-2-butene, isooctane, and m-xylene. Total hydrocarbon emission in terms of moles of exhaust hydrocarbon per mole of fuel input was lowered by increasing the amount of xylene in the fuel when operating on the fuel-rich side of stoichiometric; total hydrocarbon emission was higher for higher aromatic fuels when air-fuel ratios approached the lean misfire limit; the effect of mixture temperature on hydrocarbon emission was insignificant. l-Methyl-3-ethylbenzene was observed as a synthesis product of combustion in the exhaust from fuels con- taining w-xylene. With increasing m-xylene concentration in the fuel, the yield of l-methyl-3-ethylbenzene increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. The effect of equivalence ratio is to shift this maximum point toward lower aromatic fuels as the fuel-air mixture is leaned out.</page><page sequence="4">710013-710017 710013. Effectiveness of Exhaust Gas Recirculation with Extended Use. G. S. Musser, J. A. Wilson and R. G. Hyland, Esso Research and Engineering Co.; and H. A. Ashby, NAPCA. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was found to be an effective means of reducing automotive NOx levels with no major unsolvable problems over 52,000 miles under city/suburban driving conditions. Compatible with air injection and engine modification systems for HC and CO control, EGR effectively reduced the NOx levels with no decrease in reduction over the 52,000 miles. Engine wear and engine cleanliness with EGR was normal for the mileage and driving regime. However, the throttle area and exhaust valves were found to be sensitive to leaded fuels. 710014. Application of Catalysts to Automotive NOx Emissions Control. L. S. Bernstein, K. K. Kearby, A. K. S. Raman, J. Vardi and E. E. Wigg, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co. Nickel-copper alloys, marketed under the name Monel, have been found to be extremely active NOx reduction catalysts. At temperatures above 1300 F, and under net reducing conditions, Monel will catalyze the removal of 90% or more of the NO in automotive exhaust at space velocities of up to 100,000 v/v/hr. On unleaded fuel, Monel catalysts have shown good activity maintenance in mileage accumulation runs as long as 31,000 miles. Catalyst life is limited by physical deterioration of the catalyst which causes increases in exhaust back pressure. On unleaded fuel, Monel in its present form will last approximately 10,000 miles at 1700 F (~60 mph) before back pressure begins to rise rapidly. The presence of lead in the fuel substantially increases the rate of Monel deterioration. When Monel is used as part of a dual bed catalyst system two problems, which appear to be generic to dual bed catalyst systems, arise. First, under normal operating conditions, roughly 10% of the NO in the untreated exhaust reacts with H2 to form NH3 in the Monel bed. NH3 thus formed can be oxidized to NO in the oxidation bed. Ammonia formation can be decreased by careful control of exhaust composition. Alternatively, the con- centration of nitric oxide in the untreated exhaust can be lowered by exhaust gas recycle so that even with ammonia formation the nitric oxide concentration in the treated exhaust will be low enough to meet low emissions standards. Second, placing Monel or any other NOx reduction catalyst ahead of the oxidation catalyst slows the warmup of the oxidation catalyst. This problem has been attacked by placing the catalyst system close to the exhaust ports and modifying the exhaust system to conserve exhaust gas sensible heat. Discussion: E. E.

Irish and R. A. Potter, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp.; and R. D. McKenzie, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. The design of an automobile air cushion restraint system providing occupant protection is an extensive process of systems analysis, engineering, test and evaluation. The study described in this paper is an attempt to establish systems analysis tools which are not only effective in evaluating current systems, but which also possess growth potential as new sensor, inflation and cushion concepts are developed. The need for such systems analysis arises both from the high cost of safety-related experimentation and from the large number of safety system design parameters. This paper summarizes an air cushion restraint system study which was conducted jointly by Delco Electronics and GM Engineering Staff. The specific objectives of this study were: to develop and experimentally verify math- ematical models of selected candidate air cushion restraint systems; to provide a method for simulating the dynamic interaction between occupants and restraint system during an automobile collision; and to develop an efficient means for conducting system performance tradeoff studies of promising system concepts. Preliminary conclusions are: The vehicle crush simulation is an effective means of obtaining vehicle deceleration curves. The crash sensor simulation permits an accurate estimate of the effect of sensor design parameters on trigger time. The air cushion inflation model gives reasonable values for pressure, temperature and mass in the supply reservoir as well as in the air cushion. The revised occupant kinematics model is a useful tool for evaluation of alternate air cushion restraint systems. 1971 SA E Transactions 710016. Crash Sensor Development. Trevor O. Jones and Oliver T. McCarter, General Motors Corp. This paper has been divided into four sections. The first introduces the topic of crash sensor development and defines the terms to be employed in this field. Part two discusses the requirements set for crash detectors, namely those of amplitude, time, and direction. In the third section, reliability of sensors is discussed, emphasizing probability of normal operation in a crash situation, and probability of inadvertent operation in a noncrash situation. Finally, developments in the field of crash detector equipment are discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710017. Energy Source Selection for Inflatable Occupant Restraint System. J. T. Johnson, R. E. Mc- Comb, T. F. McDonnell and D. R. Trowbridge, Olin Corp. Engineering design features of three types of energy sources for the Inflatable Occupant Restraint System (IORS) are reviewed. These systems use: 69</page><page sequence="5">710018-710023 70 1. Compressed gas 2. Propellant 3. A combination of compressed gas and propellant as a power source for the inflation of the restraint cushion. An analysis is presented of each system with advan- tages and disadvantages related to specific design param- eters. The analysis is restricted to present state-of-the-art systems. It is also based on strictly engineering design features with recognition that product cost, patent position, and other intangibles are factors in final energy source selection. The analysis indicates several important advantages of the combined propellant-air (hybrid) system over one or both of the other two. These are: 1. Ability to obtain nontoxic gases with currently developed propellants. 2. More flexibility in control gas thermodynamics. 3. The small propellant weight requirement. 710018. Materials, Fabrication and Packs for Air Cush- ions. David Streed and C. B. Rodenbach, Uniroyal, Inc. Ure thane and neoprene coated over a lightweight nylon fabric appears to be the prime candidate for air cushion material. Evaluations to date show that an air cushion fabricated with vulcanized seams from a neoprene coated ripstop nylon produces the most reliable unit. However, urethane coated nylon also offers potential for a sewn or heat sealed unit. A typical automotive crash pad con- struction, ABS/vinyl, over an integrated urethane foam pad with suitable tear lines, produces satisfactory deco- rative covers and packs for automotive installation. 710019. Digital Simulation of an Inflatable Safety Re- straint. R. A. Hammond, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. The simulation described in this paper is intended to provide a flexible and economical tool for designing and evaluating inflatable safety restraints. It should be useful both for parameter studies and as a supplement to experiment. This two-dimensional digital simulation is now being completed as part of the CAL/AMA Two- Dimensional Crash Victim Simulation. This paper dis- cusses the assumptions made to formulate the model, sketches the simulation organization, and outlines the three major sub-models - thermodynamics, bag shape, and restraint forces. 710020. Steering Wheel Airbag Collision Performance. K. R. Trosien and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State University. Though the steering wheel has been maligned as a primary cause of injuries in automobile collisions, studies show it is the first passive restraint system in the automobile. Adding an airbag to the steering wheel distributes the energy load better than the wheel alone, and the airbag takes advantage of the space between occupant and steering wheel to protect the driver further. Specifically, the airbag utilizes space to decelerate the occupant, prevents concentrated loads on the torso, stops the face from hitting the steering wheel rim, and helps distribute impact load over a larger area. The airbag has three major components-the sensor, inflator, and airbag. The functioning of these components, as well as exper- imental investigations conducted to determine operational capabilities of the system, are discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710021. Dynamic Problems with an Air Bag Restraint System. J. A. Pflug, Ford Motor Co. Crash testing has revealed dynamic problems with present designs for air bag passive restraints which must be resolved. Out-of-position occupants can restrict deploy- ment of the air bag or affect its restraint action. In rollover and side impact accidents, today's air bag offers only minimal restraint. Accordingly, it appears essential to use the lap belt, in combination with air bags, to achieve an improved restraint system over current systems when usage rates and effectiveness are considered. The noise level created by air bag actuation may exceed tolerance levels in some humans. Inadvertent deployment of air bags could compromise the driver's control of the vehicle. These and other technical problems must be resolved before such systems are furnished in automobiles to be sold to the public. 710022. Automotive Developments in Reinforced Plastics. E. P. DePalma and D. E. Lehmkuhl, Ford Motor Co. There has been a steady growth in the use of plastics because of a better understanding of its performance, advantages, and limitations. Since 1960 reinforced plastics have played a greater role in the automotive industry in exterior applications. This paper explores the development and uses of glassfiber reinforced thermoplastics and glassfiber reinforced polyesters. Although many of the problems of these reinforced plastics have been solved, many refinements are needed; however, with these refinements, the use of reinforced plastics in the auto- motive industry will substantially increase by 1975, and thereafter. 710023. Low-Profile BMC &amp; SMC Materials, Applica- tions, and Design Guidelines. Michael K. Nor- man, Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp. New automotive applications for low-profile bulk molding compound (BMC) and sheet molding compound (SMC) are here. Guide Lamp Division, GMC, will produce several million pounds of low-profile SMC and BMC for use on 1971 models. These parts are a result of intensive materials and design development programs. In order to assure more low-profile SMC applications in the future and to keep them as economical as possible, specific guidelines are presented for the use of the designer of "low-profile" parts. A general view of the materials development programs, production operations, and the</page><page sequence="6">710024-710031 actual parts being produced by Guide Lamp are also presented. 710024. Comparison of Low Profile Premix and Sheet Molding Compound Applications. Joseph N. Epel, Duralastic Prod. Co. Low profile glass reinforced polyester bulk molding compounds (BMC) and sheet molding compounds (SMC) offer the automotive engineer two classes of materials with desirable properties for painted outside body parts. This paper compares methods of manufacture, molding pa- rameters, and properties of BMC and SMC. Several applications are analyzed and reasons for material selection discussed. 710025. Performance Characteristics of Glass Fiber Re- inforced Plastic Instrument Panel Supports. Richard J. Giba, Inland Div., General Motors Corp. The development of impact and heat distortion data for plastic instrument panel supports will be discussed using panels molded of glass fiber reinforced styrene and styrene-acrylonitrile materials. Two typical design con- figurations will be analyzed with special emphasis being given to glass fiber content and part thickness. Such information is valuable in the design and material selection of plastic instrument panel supports, primarily those parts with large unsupported areas. The glass fiber reinforced styrene-acrylonitrile mate- rials exhibit higher impact performance and improved heat distortion performance over styrene materials. 710027. Basic Electromagnetic Interference Measure- ments on Automobiles. H. Dean McKay and Kenneth W. Bach, Fairchild/Electro-Metrics Corp. The paper discusses the SAE technical program on RFI measurements and is basically a tutorial review of radio frequency interference/electromagnetic interference measurements on automobiles. The text is designed to provide engineers and technicians not familiar with RFI/EMI measurements with a basic appreciation of the measurements, the terminology used, the reasons for measurements, and how measured data should be pre- sented. SAE standard J551a is discussed. Given are background and data on basic descriptions of EMI and its effects on the environment; the basic history of electric field measurements and antennas; characteristics of receivers - including descriptions of heterodyning, mixing, peak detection, average detection, and quasi-peak detec- tion - and a brief history of EMI receivers. 710028. An Examination of Radiated Ignition Interference Levels from Motor Vehicles. D. W. Morris, Joseph Lucas Limited, England. In view of impending changes in the British Standard concerned with ignition interference, to conform with the recent International Agreement (E. C. E. Regulation No. 10) and the probable corresponding amendment to the United Kingdom legislation, a series of road-side meas- urements of ignition interference radiation has been made on more than 10,000 vehicles. From the known suppression arrangements currently used on the vehicles measured, the results have been analyzed as to their efficacy in relation to present United Kingdom legislation and the E. C. E. International Regulation; reference is also made to the SAE Standard J551 (a) and (b). The effects of multisource ignition interference re- sulting from areas of high density traffic on the reception of VHF frequency-modulated radio and VHF positive- modulation TV signals are described. 710029. Ignition Noise Effects on Land Mobile Commu- nications Receivers. Charles W. Beerling, Motor- ola, Inc. Automobile ignition noise effects on land mobile com- munications receivers are a function of engine rpm, the antenna position relative to the vehicle, and the type of spark plugs and wires used in the ignition system. Techniques for the suppression of these effects involve the use of proper shielding and pulse type electronic noise suppression circuitry built into the receiver. There are limitations to the effectiveness of electronic noise sup- pression. These limitations result from both high repe- tition rate bursts of ignition noise and interference effects caused by off-channel carriers. 1971 SAE Transactions 710030. The Suppression of Electromagnetic Radiation from Motor Vehicles. D. W. Briggs and J. V. Clore, General Motors Corp. A study of General Motors Corporation culminated in the development of an electromagnetic radiation suppression technique for car and truck ignition systems. The suppression technique described utilizes ignition resistor spark plugs, resistor ignition wire, and a widened dis- tributor rotor gap. Test data is shown which indicates that significant electromagnetic radiation suppression is achieved with the technique, with no detrimental effects to engine performance, cold start, and exhaust emission controls. The low level of interference emitted with application of the technique is discussed in relation to the Society of Automotive Engineers Standard - "Measure- ment of Electromagnetic Radiation from Motor Vehicles (20 to 1000 MHJ" - SAE J551a. 710031. A Progress Report on the Detroit Electromag- netic Survey. A. C. Doty, Jr., Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc. A unique research test program of vehicle electromagnetic radiation that might cause radio interference has provided data in areas not previously studied. Reports are pre- sented on: electromagnetic radiation from single vehicles versus multiple vehicle radiation (20-1000 MHz), hori- 71</page><page sequence="7">710033-710039 72 zontal versus vertical polarity of radiation from vehicles (20-1000 MHz), and microwave (1-2.5 GHz) radiation from vehicles. Included is a brief history of the automobile industry and SAE investigations of vehicle radio interference which have been undertaken since 1935. 1971 SAE Transactions 710033. Electrical Quick Heat: Concept and Application. James R. Cherry, Motorola Inc. An electrical quick heat system, composed of a three- phase alternator, a resistive heating assembly, and simple controls can be easily integrated with a standard hot water heating system or utilized with its own blower and plenum chamber. Such a system, with a 5 in. diameter alternator, can supply up to 2.5 kW of power which can be used to give greater than 100 F air temperature boost in less than 30 sec. The simplicity of the system should bring it within most economic bogeys for automotive quick heat systems. 710034. Electrical Power Source for Automotive Quick Heat Systems. Jerome P. Frysztak, Motorola Inc. The adaptation of an automotive alternator designed for charging system applications as a power source for an electric "quick heat" system is described. The system is intended to augment the present hot-water system for brief periods during low-temperature conditions of the normal underhood temperature range. Application of this reserve electric power can be made easily and at low cost by modification of existing alternator design. 710035. Automotive Quick-Heat System: Combustion Techniques. F. E. Kalivoda and J. H. Hoffman, Stewart-Warner Corp. The excellent performance of the modern automobile environmental control system tends to accentuate the passenger discomfort experienced during the engine warm-up period in very cold weather. Quick-heat systems utilizing combustion techniques can significantly reduce this warm-up period and not only improve comfort, but also contribute to safety and improved engine life. These factors are discussed, together with details of a quick-heat system which reduced the warm-up time of a large American automobile by over 80% in actual tests. 710036. Ventilation System Aerodynamics-A New Design Method. Stanley B. Wallis, Ford Motor Co. A new method of testing and presenting climate control systems airflow rates is presented, using interior vehicle pressure as a parameter. A Polar diagram can be constructed showing the performance of the complete system, i.e., ventilation, heater, air conditioner, etc. at a given vehicle speed, normally 60 mph. Analysis of the Polar curves can aid in improvements to a present system, design of new systems or even help in predicting the performance of future systems not yet built. The effect of the aerodynamics of the vehicle body shape on internal flow is discussed. The pressures at both the inlet and exit location for the flow is equally important and are easily determined during the wind tunnel test. With the increasing use of high level instrument panel registers, new methods of establishing design requirements are needed. Subjective rating curves of Hi-Lo distributions are also discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710037. Automotive Air Conditioning Systems with Ab- sorption Refrigeration. Joseph R. Akerman, The University of Michigan. An automotive absorption air conditioning system would use engine rejected heat as its energy source. Three possible cycles were studied based on using water-lithium bromide, ammonia-water, and refrigerant 22-dimethyl ether of tetraethylene glycol as the refrigerant-absorbent pairs. Heat balances were calculated for the cycles and for a comparable vapor compression cycle. Energy input requirements, cooling capacities, coefficients of per- formance, and pressures and temperatures at various points in the cycle are given. Energy input requirements are compared with test data on the heat rejection from a 390 cu in. displacement production engine. 1971 SAE Transactions 710038. New Refrigerants for Automotive Air Condition- ing. K. P. Murphy, Allied Chemical Corp. The performance of eight refrigerants in an automotive air conditioning system has been analyzed. In addition, the problems of hose permeation and elastomer compatibility have been studied. The results indicate that two of these new refrigerants have promise in automotive air con- ditioning. 710039. Permeation of Refrigerants Through Elastomeric and Plastic Hoses. R. F. Goldman and D. D. Rudy, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. High permeation losses through nitrile rubber hoses have prevented use of refrigerants other than R-12 in auto- mobile air conditioners. Alternate hose materials were evaluated. Two materials were shown to have acceptable permeation loss rates of the two commercial refrigerants which appear suitable for automotive air conditioning. The effect of oil on refrigerant permeation was found to be relatively unimportant. Since two of the refrigerant candidates were azeotropes R-500 and R-502, the effect of different permeation rates on the mixture composition was studied. Using permeation constants developed in this study, calculations were made of losses from a typical system which showed that permeation losses were small compared to other source losses, such as through fittings or shaft seals.</page><page sequence="8">710040-710045 710040. Effect of Loading Geometry on the Stress-Strain Behavior of Plastic Foams in Cushioning Design Study. Wei-Ming Lee, The Dow Chemical Co. The dependence of the compressive stress-strain behavior of plastic foams on the loading geometry and its significance in relation to the cushioning design study for automobile safety is explored. Experimental load-deflec- tion responses obtained under dynamic (impact) and static conditions using loading objects of various different geometry are analyzed. A strong interaction between the loading geometry and the material response existed. It was found that the stress-strain behavior of plastic foams varied, whether under static or dynamic conditions, with the loading geometry. The linear load-deflection response observed in the case of hemi-spherical loading differed from that of the convoluted faceform loading, while the response for the flat plate compression deviated from both. The importance of this loading geometry effect in connection with the development of an effective crash padding system for automobile vehicles is discussed in detail in terms of the peak deceleration and the maximum average stress produced upon impact on the plastic foams. The analysis of the test results leads to the conclusion that a realistic evaluation of the cushioning system should incorporate into it this geometry effect by the selection of an appropriate loading geometry. The dependence of the stress-strain behavior on foam density, foam thickness, and the nature of the base polymer from which the foam is expanded is also briefly discussed in this paper. 710041. Quality Control of Automotive Seat Spring Assemblies. Gerald D. Robinson, Lear Siegler, Inc. Automotive seat spring assemblies are now subject to much closer tolerance control due to the new government safety standards which, in addition to outlining specific mounting force resistance specifications, have added such tolerance complicating components as front seat back latches and headrests. Since these seat assemblies are made in many locations far remote from the automotive assembly plants, it is imperative that the quality control system operate at maximum effectiveness, using gaging and sampling tech- niques that cut rejects to an absolute minimum. This paper discusses a new quality control system that has been installed in three different seat manufacturing plants. It includes a discussion of new photographic type assembly gages, new gages for springs that hold the springs in exact manner in which they are supported in the seat assembly, quality approval and rejection systems for evaluating die tooling and produced parts at both the beginning and end of the production runs, a quality control training program for new employees, methods of inspecting raw material upon receipt before production is begun, and flex testing of final assemblies to make certain that all seat deflection and contour specifications are met. 710042. Measurement and Display of the Load Distri- bution on a Vehicle Seat. Hanji Umehara, Ryotaro Hikida, Hiroshi Kuno and Mutsuo Sawa, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc.; and Kameo Uchiyamada, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. To supplement the subjective appraisal of seat comfort, a new instrument capable of quantitative measurement and real-time display of a seat load has been developed. The pressure detecting part comprises 300 small pressure transducers of disc type installed inside an automobile bucket seat. Highly sensitive semiconductor strain gages are used as pressure sensing elements. The outputs from sensors are displayed on a CRT device whose screen is crosshatched into 300 parts corresponding to each sensor. Pressure distribution on a seat is shown by the difference in brightness on the screen. Brightness modulation can be made in five stages or on continuous level. The outputs are recorded and reproduced by a data recorder. Equipressure contours can be plotted through a digital computer. Some of the vehicle tests results are described. 710044. An Investigation of the Brake Force Distribution on Tractor-Semitrailer Combinations. Rudolf Limpert, The University of Michigan. An engineering analysis of tractor-semitrailer braking is presented in terms of the utilization of available tire- roadway friction. The effects of load transfer on the tandem axle suspension upon braking performance are discussed. The physical relations are derived that allow the determination of an improved brake force distri- butions among the axles of the combination as a function of the geometric and loading configuration. Tractor- semitrailers operating on our highways have braking efficiencies as low as 60%. Increase in braking per- formance can be expected provided the brake force distribution is improved. Eliminating the front brakes without changing the base line distribution has an unfavorable effect upon the braking performance of the combination. 1971 SA E Transactions 710045. The Dynamics of Tractor-Semitrailer Vehicles: The Jackknifing Problem. E. C. Mikulcik, The University of Calgery. The equations of motion for a tractor-semitrailer vehicle, in which both the tractor and semitrailer can pitch, roll, yaw and translate, are derived and solved numerically in their nonlinear form for steering and braking inputs. The linearized equations are also determined and solved for 73</page><page sequence="9">710046-710051 74 comparison with the nonlinear model. The results dem- onstrate the occurrence of jackknifing of the nonlinear model, even without the application of braking forces, for certain steering inputs while the linearized model is stable. Violent jackknifing caused by braking is found to take place in the nonlinear model whenever braking forces at the rear tractor wheels are of sufficient magnitude to limit or reduce the side forces occurring there; locking of the wheels is not required. Jackknifing can not always be prevented by damping (short of locking) at the hitch, but the action can be slowed down considerably. 1971 SAE Transactions 710046. Development of Braking Performance Require- ments for Buses, Trucks, and Tractor-Trailers. Ray W. Murphy, Rudolf Limpert and Leonard Segel, The University of Michigan. This paper reports the results of a study which had as its aim the determination of braking performance currently achievable by buses, trucks, and tractor-trailers, and the improvement of this performance by use of advanced braking systems. Both vehicle testing and analytical techniques, including dynamic modeling and simulation, were used in the program. Performance qualities essential to braking systems are enumerated, which, when given quantitative definition in the light of performance achiev- able, can form the basis of rational performance require- ments for commercial vehicles. 1971 SAE Transactions 710047. Proportional Braking of Solid-Frame Vehicles. Rudolf Limpert, The University of Michigan; and Charles Y. Warner, Brigham Young Uni- versity. An engineering analysis of vehicle braking is presented in terms of the utilization of available road friction. Physical relations are derived which allow the determination of optimum brake force distribution on front and rear wheels as a function of axle loading. Ideal braking distribution curves as shown for a typical vehicle in the loaded and unloaded, conditions. A technique is suggested for rational design of braking system parameters. It is applied to the case of a two-stage proportioning system, and is validated by experimental data from tests using a specially equipped light truck. It is concluded that a proper design analysis can establish a combination of braking system parameters which results in improved utilization of available friction. A simple, self-adjusting brake proportioning system can be a highly cost-effective safety device for truck use. 1971 SAE Transactions 710048. Manufacture of Paperboard. David W. Flotow, Consolidated Packaging Corp.; and James V. LaMarre, Time Container Corp. The basic raw material used in manufacture of fiberboard is cellulose fiber which is obtained from trees and/or reclaimed (waste) paper. Cellulose fibers are obtained from trees by the "pulping" operation which involves debarking, chipping, and cooking with chemicals to separate the cellulose from other wood components. Cellulose fibers are obtained from reclaimed paper by mechanical pulping in water. Cellulose fibers, once pulped, go through the stock preparation phase where they are cleaned and sent through a refining stage. The conditioned fibers are sent to the paper machine in a water slurry for conversion to paperboard. The paper machine is a large controlled water removal system having four distinctive manufacturing steps: mat formation, pressing, drying, and calendering. The paper board from the paper machine is sheeted or wound in rolls. It may be sold in this condition or undergo further processing such as laminating or coating before it is sent to the automotive fabricator. 710049. Manufacture of Hardboard. Larry R. Artman, Masonite Corp. From efforts to utilize waste wood fiber more fully from the lumber industry has come a substrate now widely used for interior trim parts in automobiles. Hardboard results from the separation of wood fibers, formation of the fiber into a mat, and subsequent consolidation with heated presses. Humidification of the pressed board followed by trimming and edging complete the manufacturing process of hardboard. Environmental improvement is a contin- uous program in the hardboard industry and has resulted in the development of a number of salable byproducts from mill residue. 710050. Fabricating and Finishing of Fiberboards. P. E. Hoyal, Fabricon Products Div., Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. This paper describes many of the methods of fabricating and finishing fiberboard parts for the automotive indus- try. Fabricating methods include diecutting, crease- bending, forming, fastening, and adhesive bonding. Finishing methods discussed are paint roll coating, spray painting, printing and embossing. The equipment and tooling required are also described. 710051. Fiberboard in the Automobile. Frederick H. Lieb, Chrysler Corp.; and John B. McCallum, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents a brief description of each of the main types of fiberboard used in the automobile. It covers typical applications for fiberboards with detailed infor- mation only on the interior trim parts. Applications where fiberboard and plastics compete are discussed. Also included are the advantages and disadvantages of fiber-</page><page sequence="10">710054-710061 boards. The effect of humidity changes on fiberboard resulting in dimensional changes and warping tendencies in the fiberboard are explained with illustrations which emphasize the need for proper fastening of fiberboard and a method of measuring warpage. Test methods, per- formance testing, and possible future applications are discussed. 710054. The Impact of New Transportation on Future Living Patterns. Edward J. Ward, Dept. of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administra- tion. New transportation systems will affect living patterns in the future. Past experience indicates three principles: the availability of new transportation facilities generates new travel; commuting time has remained constant while commuting distances have steadily lengthened; popula- tion and industry locate where transportation is available. Examples substantiate each principle. Government policy has replaced terrain and geography in determining the location of transportation facilities. The implementation of multimodal planning is necessary. Changes in all modes of transportation will occur. 710055. Future Electronic Alternatives to Travel. James Hillier, RCA Corp. The increased electronic options becoming available are alternatives to travel. Electronics offers the only dis- cernible solution for the individual's growing appetite for wider contact and varied experience. Developments in personal and mass communications- including cable television, prerecorded video, home TV recording, home facsimile, computers, and picture phones-sometimes have unexpected social and economic results. A tyranny of numbers resulting from the concentration of an increasing population is changing the environment from a mechan- ical one dependent on transportation to one increasing based on the use of electronics. 710057. POEM - A Computer-Assisted Procedure for Optimizing Elastomeric Mountings. Daniel Zi- bello, Jr., Enjay Polymer Labs.; and Frank M. Thompson, Enjay Chemical Co. A Procedure for Optimizing Elastomeric Mountings (POEM) is described which provides a systematic inves- tigation of vehicle ride performance as a function of both the spring rate and damping of a selected mounting. POEM assumes the mounting design and its placement on the vehicle have been established. Then nine mounts satisfying a three-level factorial experiment in spring rate and damping are evaluated. Evaluations can be subjective or objective and can employ laboratory simulators or road tests. Dynamic properties of the mounts are measured at simulated on-car conditions. Computer step-wise regres- sions of the data are performed to define any perform- ance/property relationships. Final regression equations are contourized by computer, displaying performance versus dynamic properties. Results enable easy and quantitative optimization of dynamic properties. Exam- ples of POEM analyses are given. 710058. A New Elastomeric Suspension Spring. Regis V. Schmitt and Matthew L. Kerr, Lord Manufac- turing Co. This paper describes a constant natural frequency spher- ical elastomeric spring element. The concept of constant natural frequency and its advantage in providing consis- tent ride quality with varying vehicle weight is reviewed. Performance data on the spherical spring for both laboratory and field tests is presented and evaluated. 710060. Air Pollution Control - Getting into Gear. John T. Middleton, U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, &amp; Welfare. This paper outlines the provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act and the steps that must be taken by the federal government, state and local governments, industry, and the public to implement its provisions. The basis of the standards to be issued under the Act is the need to protect the public health and welfare. The need to attain them will either force the use of available technology or create new pressures for the discovery and demonstration of new methods to control air pollution. The federal government will set the goals, it will be up to the state and local administrations, planners, and technicians to find ways to meet them. The effect of this at all levels of government is outlined. The automobile is the source of about half of the air pollution in the United States. Therefore, the automobile is the principal target of this Clean Air Act. This may well press the internal combustion engine to its design limits and require new approaches by industry and its engineers. 710061. Noise in Engineering and Transportation and Its Effect on the Community. T. Priede, Southamp- ton University, England. This paper discusses the sources of noise pollution in the civilized human environment and reviews the numerous criteria which have evolved for their assessment and description. It is stressed that criteria should be estab- lished in simple basic units and dBA values are recom- mended. By far the most common single source of annoyance is that of road transportation noise and this aspect has been covered in specific detail. Methods of predicting vehicle noise from the engine design and operating parameters are shown and some measures for noise reduction are discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 75</page><page sequence="11">710062-710071 76 710062. Water Pollution: A Perspective. Walter J. Weber, Jr., The University of Michigan. Complex problems of maintaining environmental quality are closely associated with technologic expansion and growth; prime among these are the problems of water pollution and a degraded water resource. The intent of this discussion is to provide a reasonably comprehensive overview of water pollution and abatement measures in the industrialized United States, with some insight to public and private attitudes and policies with respect to pollution. 710063. Woodgrain Techniques for Trim Components. Bernard K. Dent, Sheller-Globe Corp. Two new developments in woodgrain finishing techniques for zinc die cast trim components are revealed which apply the permanent finishes to the casting surface. Product design details and comparative costs of chro- mium plated ABS and zinc are given for a typical instrument panel trim bezel. Recommended design fea- tures and basic pressure sensitive adhesive specifications are discussed which should eliminate adhesive bonding failures for woodgrain appliques used on trim compo- nents. 710065. Dielectric Bonding of Metal Moldings - The Dual-Durometer Concept. Dan M. Davey, Allied Chemical Corp. When the stylist or engineer specifies a metal molding for use on an interior trim panel, the normal procedure has been to include sheet metal tabs or die cast studs for attachment, with attendant labor costs. The Dual Duro- meter method provides a bondable metal molding which can be attached dielectrically in the same embossing die that produces the trim panel design. 710066. A History of Headlining. Julie Auerbach, Chrys- ler Corp. This paper describes the history of the design and method of installation of cut-and-sew headlining and how it is affected by the design of the body beginning with the all-wooden construction of the first Chrysler up to the present day design. Construction of the headlining listing seam, the drafting procedure for determining their location and trim off around the window and door openings is described. 710067. Headliners - Molded Fiberglass. G. A. Horton, Johns-Manville Sales Corp. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages, the engineering benefits and limitations, and the features available to the stylist of molded fiberglass headliners. It also includes diagrams of making fiberglass and the manufacturing processes involved in molding, shaping, and trimming, and discusses type of glass, binders, and future possibilities of this product. 710068. What is New in Automotive Headliners? J. W. Greig, Woodall Industries. This paper describes the development of a process that will mold a urethane resin in the form of a laminate. The ure thane resin is a most unusual material: it can be formulated to produce thermosetting foam of almost any density, and the formulation can also be made to produce either a flexible or rigid foam. It has excellent adhesive properties, which we have used to make the laminate. The process produces a laminate of two skins, which are combined with a film of urethane resin in its liquid form. This combination, when placed in a heated mold, causes the resin to expand until both skins reach the confine of the mold. This then cures to the shape of the mold and the texture of its surface, making it possible to mold sculptured and formed shapes or panels, which can be used for interior trim for automobiles. 710069. Exhaust Emission Control for Used Cars. G. W. Niepoth, G. P. Ransom and J. H. Currie, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. An exhaust emission control systems has been developed for used cars of the 1955-1967 model years. Average exhaust emissions were reduced on 194 cars by 53% HC, 33% CO, and 31% NOx. The package consists of increased idle speed, leaner idle mixture, and retarded ignition timing. A thermostatic vacuum switch provides engine cooling protection with the retarded ignition. For max- imum effectiveness of the control, the engine must be in good running condition. Discussion: Paul E. McKee, Ford Motor Co.; and M. L. Brubacher, Motorists United. 1971 SA E Transactions 710070. Vehicle Maintenance for Low Emissions-A Cus- tomer Education Problem. Joseph M. Gall and David A. Olds, The University of Michigan. An automotive tune-up clinic for the purpose of reducing undesirable exhaust emissions was held March 14, 1970, as part of an environmental teach-in. The event was sponsored by the student branch of SAE at the University of Michigan. The results of this event clearly show that improper automotive maintenance can be a major factor in atmospheric pollution. It was found that idle hydro- carbon emissions were reduced by an average of 55% with a tune up in which the idle mixture ratio and speed were adjusted for minimum carbon monoxide emissions. Our conclusion is that the individual motorist must begin to develop an attitude of responsibility toward the main- tenance of his automobile to ensure low emissions. 710071. Auto Smog Inspection at Idle Only, Part II: Oxides of Nitrogen. Marian F. Chew, Auto Exhaust Emissions. Maintenance programs indicate that exhaust emission controlled cars with hydrocarbon emissions above 400</page><page sequence="12">710072-710077 ppm or carbon monoxide above 2.25% will have emissions reduced by proper maintenance. Distribution curves of recent surveillance data show that one-third of the 1966-69 cars do have emissions above these assured reduction levels. Calculations show that maintenance based on reduc- ing high emitters of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide should reduce total hydrocarbon by 19%, carbon mon- oxide by 30%, but increase oxides of nitrogen by 9%. Further calculations show that maintenance based on reducing high emitters of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and, in addition, oxides of nitrogen, should reduce total hydrocarbon by 20%, carbon monoxide by 25%, and also reduce oxides of nitrogen by 6%. The inclusion of oxides of nitrogen testing along with hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide in the idle inspection test method is nearly as effective in identifying high emitters of HC, CO, and HOx. 710072. An Ozone-NO Chemiluminescence Method for NO Analysis in Piston and Turbine Engines. H. Niki, A. Warnick and R. R. Lord, Ford Motor Co. A method for the measurement of NO in photochemical smog research was developed using the chemilumin- escence from the rapid reaction between ozone (03) and NO. An instrument based on this method has been constructed; it is applicable to a number of automotive problems. This NO detector has been tested extensively in both laboratory and dynamometer experiments, and has been shown to have several outstanding features: detec- tion sensitivity of 0.01-5000 ppm, selective detection for NO, continuous monitoring with fast response time, and good stability and ease of operation. Examples of results obtained in turbine experiments and in vehicle exhaust analysis are presented. Discussion: A. Fontijn, AeroChem Research Labs., Inc.; L. F. Gilbert, Ethyl Corp.; and Arthur D. Snyder, Monsanto Research Corp.; Authors' closure 1971 SA E Transactions 710074. Where Are All Those Gadgets Going? C. M. Heinen, Product Planning and Dev. Staff, Chrysler Corp. With the passage of the federal Clean Air Act, the automotive industry has a clear assignment to reduce automobile emissions drastically by 1975. The control devices presently available have already reduced hydro- carbons 83%, carbon monoxide 70%, and nitrogen oxides 33%. By 1975, these figures must be 98%, 97%, and 90%, respectively. This paper discusses the devices that have been developed to accomplish the reduction to date, and concludes that in the future the crankcase controls will require little change, that the evaporative controls will require some additional improvement but will not change substantially, and that engine modifications do not have much chance of meeting the 1975 standards without a great deal of supplementation. The author feels two methods are available which may be able to reach the 1975 standards: use of manifold reactors and use of catalysts. However, both present problems of materials and thermodynamics, due to high exhaust temperatures. This is the engineering challenge in the next five years. 710075. Automotive Emissions Research and the Coor- dinating Research Council Program. C. E. Moser, Texaco Inc. The Coordinating Research Council research program on vehicle emissions consists of some thirty projects with a three-year projected cost of more than $10 million. The functional Air Pollution Research Advisory Committee and the Project Manager oversee these studies, encom- passing the fields of engineering, atmospheric chemistry, and medicine. Results are being utilized by industry and government to reduce the level of emissions now con- taminating the atmosphere. 710076. Automobile Occupant Ejection Through the Side Door Glass. D. F. Huelke, University of Mich- igan Medical School; and Harold W. Sherman, Highway Safety Research Inst. Ejection of car occupants through door openings has been markedly reduced in the new model cars. However, cases have now been found where car occupants are being ejected through the side door glass opening or directly through the side glass. Twenty-one cases of ejection through the side glass are described. 710077. Lap-Shoulder Restraint Effectiveness in the Unit- ed States. W. D. Nelson, Safety Res. &amp; Dev. Lab., General Motors Corp. Lap-shoulder belts, although infrequently used by vehicle occupants, are demonstrating a remarkably high reduc- tion of injury in collisions where they were used. A search was made for all collision in the GM files where at least one occupant was wearing the lap-shoulder belt combi- nation restraint. Of the 160 cases found for this study, 60% of the vehicles had heavy damage of the type often associated with occupant injury; however, 99% of the lap-shoulder belt users either had no injury or only minor injury. The only two fatalities found in the study involved an accident occurring under unusual circumstances. This paper describes 18 of the most severe damage and/or injury cases by means of photographs and collision descriptions. Some grouping of body injuries is also listed. These data illustrate that the use of different occupant restraint configurations (unrestrained, lap belt, and lap-shoulder belt) affect the severity of injuries to 77</page><page sequence="13">710078-710083 78 various body areas. In addition, a notable shift in the frequency of injury to various body areas is also shown. 710078. An Energy Absorbing Restraint System. R. W. McLay, The University of Vermont; F. J. Blackstone, Inventor, Burlington, Vt.; and P. K. Das, Yale University. An energy-absorbing restraint system that limits the accelerations of a passenger in a forward auto crash to 20 g's is presented. The device absorbes energy through the continuous bending of a steel wire. Results of an elastic-plastic analysis of the device indicate that it closely approximates a constant force energy absorber; the force is only a weak function of velocity. Preliminary results from drop tests and high-speed impact tests to 100 mph indicate that the absorber can limit acceleration to a specified value. The results of two tests in which the device was used to restrain a volunteer during a head-on crash are presented. In each crash a vehicle driven at 50 mph impacted a parked vehicle. The results show that the restraint system protects a man in a forward crash by limiting his accelerations to a level below the threshold of injury for the vital organs. 710079. Volunteer, Anthropometric Dummy, and Cadaver Responses with Three and Four Point Restraints. L. M. Patrick and K. R. Trosien, Wayne State University. This paper gives an evaluation of the performance of lap and shoulder belt restraint systems currently being used in American-built automobiles and a comparison of the response characteristics of a volunteer, an anthropomor- phic dummy, and a cadaver when subjected to identical collision environments while wearing a three or four point torso restraint system as occupants of the right front seat. Simulated frontal force barrier collisions in a modified automobile provided the realistic environment for the restraint system performance study. Human tolerances, interior vehicle geometry, and the interaction of the restrained occupant with the vehicle during the collision are reported in detail. 1971 SA E Transactions 710080. Measurement of Vehicle Response in Severe Braking and Steering Maneuvers. Howard Dug- off, Leonard Segel and R. D. Ervin, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A set of safety-relevant performance qualities for the passenger car has been defined as a first step in the development of objective measures of precrash safety performance. Measures were sought that stress the performance produced by a passenger vehicle when it is operated under emergency, crash-avoidance conditions. This goal has led to the identification of six limit maneuvers and associated limit responses to serve as a first-order means of assessing the safety quality of a motor vehicle. The viability and the discriminatory power of the proposed test procedures have been demonstrated by applying these procedures to four separate vehicles. Discussion: Joseph B.

Performance Tasks as Measures of Vehicle Handling Qualities at the Limit of Performance. M. R. Belsdorf, R. S. Rice and K. D. Bird, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. Several performance tasks have been developed as objective measures of vehicle handling qualities. These tasks are shown to give consistent and repeatable results for any given vehicle condition and to discriminate between different vehicle conditions. They are practical, require simple instrumentation, and are related to per- formance. The philosophy of the tasks, instrumentation, test procedures, and typical results are presented. It is concluded that these tasks or modifications of them have utility in many design and performance evaluation applications. 710082. Design and Initial Development of a High Specific Output 500 CC Single Cylinder, Two- Stroke, Racing Motorcycle Engine. G. P. Blair and W. L. Cahoon, The Queen's University of Belfast, Ireland. This paper describes the initial investigation and design of a lightweight racing motorcycle with a single-cylinder two-stroke engine, capable of producing 60 bhp. The data discussed here pertains to the gas dynamic and mechan- ical parts and functions of the cycle. Designs of the various components are described and reports of tests on road and test beds verify the viability of this concept of a high specific output and large displacement cylinder for a lightweight, air-cooled motorcycle engine. 710083. How Near the Optimum in High-Speed Two- Stroke Engines? J. Ehrlich, Ehrlich Engineering Ltd. An account is given of the author's experiences in designing and developing small 2 stroke cycle engines. These have covered a wide range of performance re- quirements, from the "chore horse" used for chain saws and similar duties, to engines for boats, road-going motorcycles, and cars, through to engines for the spe- cialized purpose of motorcycle Grand Prix racing. The latter must be capable of specific power in the region of 300 bhp/1 to be competitive. 1971 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="14">710084-710091 710084.

Cave, Bath University of Technology, England. This paper introduces the development of a new idea in traction prime movers, to be known as the Differential Compound Engine. The DCE contains in addition to the compressor, an exhaust driven turbine geared into the output shaft, which leads to improved power and efficiency. It also enables the engine to operate at unchanged speed and power, regardless of output shaft speed. This concept was designed to provide an integrated engine transmission of high output and with stepless single pedal control. 710086. Tire Uniformity and Correlation to Vehicle Ride. L. A. Gursky, Ford Motor Co. Tire uniformity grading machines have become an indispensable tool used by all original equipment tire producers for screening tires to acceptable levels for automobile manufacturers. However, so many machines and procedures have been used by tire manufacturers in the past, that correlating tire uniformity levels from various sources and determining the effect of variations on the ride quality of passenger vehicles have been difficult. Logical follow-up ride evaluations of vehicles have been conducted in comprehensive programs to further investigate the correlation of the various nonuniformity parameters and their individual and compound effects upon ride quality. Investigations are also being conducted to determine correlations of high-speed tire uniformity to low-speed and vehicle ride. These and other efforts are directed toward an eventual development of a mathe- matical description of tire-vehicle behavior. 710087. Advances in Wheel Uniformity. Douglas D. Maclntyre, Kelsey-Hayes Co. A new process has been developed for the manufacture of passenger car wheels to reduce the effect of the wheel on vehicle shake. The process is now in production and the resulting improvements in uniformity are detailed here. 710088. The Vehicle Application of Tire/ Wheel Rolling Smoothness Controls. C. W. Daberkoe, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. Increased emphasis on high speed vehicle rolling smooth- ness may be attributed to the growing network of Interstate highways. Tire/wheel vibration inputs which disturb highway rolling smoothness are measurable in terms of: 1. force variation of the tires, 2. runout variation of the wheels. New techniques are available to screen and correct for excessive tire and wheel variations. These techniques apply to the tires or wheels individually; or to the tire/wheel assembly. Tire/wheel assembly screening and tire honing cor- rection is a unique method which has been implemented at Cadillac Motor Car Division. This improvement was adopted to enhance the luxury ride of the Fleetwood Eldorado vehicle during the 1970 model run. 710089. Reduction of Tire Nonuniformities by Machining Techniques. James Hamburg and John Horsch, General Motors Res. Labs. Machining techniques that reduce the amplitude of low-speed radial uniformity measurements and the effects on smooth-road vehicle vibrations were investigated. The methods ranged from simple concentric and eccentric truing suited for service work to a servo-controlled tire-wheel assembly measuring and corrective machine installed at an auto assembly plant. These methods produce significant reduction of the measured low-speed radial uniformity. Corresponding vehicle evaluation show- ed significant reduction of smooth-road shake - a 1 per wheel revolution vibration - but little change of higher order vibrations. The simplicity of eccentric truing, combined with its predictable reduction of shake, provides a service fix for smooth-road shake. 710091. Investigation of Tire-Road Traction Properties. F. D. Smithson, General Motors Corp.; and F. H. Herzegh, B. F. Goodrich Tire Co. Tire traction performance is dependent on both the tire design and the road surface on which the tire is operated. Measurement of a tire's traction capabilities is indicative of the performance of the tire-road surface combination. Therefore, it is important that the surfaces used to evaluate tire traction capabilities react in a manner similar to those on which the tire will operate. This paper presents a method for categorizing road surface traction properties by evaluating the traction performance of road surfaces when tested with a series of special tires. Data are presented on a series of road surfaces and recommendations are made for traction test surface design. 1971 SAE Transactions 19</page><page sequence="15">710092-710098 80 710092.

A description is given of the system design and capabilities, including operating features, transducing elements, tracking stabilization, and data signal proc- essing. The equipment will measure cornering traction capabilities as influenced by dynamic slip angle, camber angle, braking, speed, road surface, and road surface contaminants.

John F. Gulau, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes a program conducted on a 1971 Continental Mark III to derive profiles of engine com- partment temperatures for analysis of severe environment conditions to which primary wire would be subjected. Also covered are solutions to provide primary wire material selection, routing, and protective devices for specific problem areas. 710094. Heat Resistance Characteristics of Primary Wire Insulations. Arlan D. Lewis, Essex International, Inc. Increasing automotive engine compartment temperatures have produced a need for more heat resistant insulations on primary wire. The heat problems with which insu- lations must cope are loss of resistance to cut-through and deformation, loss of elongation over the long term, and an increase in the destructive effects of extended current overloads. A number of insulating materials are compared through standard laboratory tests. Deformation and cut-through resistance are shown through pinch test performance. Retention of elongation is demonstrated by both slab and wire tests after circulating air oven aging. Extreme current overload effects are compared by short circuit tests on mock harness assemblies. 710095. Radiation Cross-Linked Polymers for the Au- tomotive Engine Environment. G. P. Brown, R. F. Kopczewski and M. Metlay, Carnegie-Mellon University. Irradiation of polymers by electrons or gamma rays effects cross-linking and increases high-temperature ca- pabilities. Cross-linking does not, however, increase resistance to chemical degradation of a polymer. Changes in formulation can inhibit high-temperature oxidative degradation. The results of tests on the high-temperature stability of a series of Polyvinylchloride formulations is presented, showing that changes in formulation accom- panied by radiation cross-linking improve the ability of an insulation to function in high-temperature environments. 710096. The Paradox of Fiat Block Magnets in Small Motor Design. F. Richard Merriam, General Parts Div., Ford Motor Co. In many small permanent magnet motors the conven- tional arc-shaped ferrite magnets can be replaced with flat blocks of high-energy ferrites at a substantial economic advantage and with an improvement in motor perform- ance. Confining itself to magnet field design only for a given armature, this paper shows by rigorous calculation and illustrations the relative effects of varying the design parameters of air gap length, magnet thickness, pole arc angle, magnet length, and magnet grade characteristics. Inherent with flat block magnet field configurations is a longer air gap length at the pole tips. This reduces magnet cogging and contributes to reduction in pole tip demagnetization due to armature reaction. In addition, the higher energy product of fully oriented flat ferrites relative to the peak energy product of most arcuate segments can result in a significantly lower volume of magnet material required.

Several new features have been developed for light-duty cranking motors which reduce costs, improve manufac- turing productivity, and improve reliability. These include a face type commutator which combines the function of current collection and connection to the armature wind- ings, fully insulated plastic molded brushgear, a single field coil to replace the four coils of a conventional four pole field system, a five roller extruded roller clutch, and a solenoid with a two part sintered iron body. 710098. Optimization of Cranking Motor Design by Computer. R. H. Hartley and R. L. White, Joseph Lucas (Electrical) Limited. This paper introduces a design method, suitable for use on a computer, which predicts the performance of a cranking motor from the geometry of the machine and the material characteristics. The versatility of this method is illustrated by describing its use to produce optimum motor designs, to determine the effect of manufacturing and materials specification tolerances, and to investigate marginal variations of component parameters in cranking systems.</page><page sequence="16">710099-710107 710099. New Flame Retardant Plastics and Requirements in the Auto Industry. Kiyo Hattori, Fiberfil Div., DART Industries Inc. Two ñame retardant products based on new reinforced polymers are described and property data are presented.

Lexan 500 is a new polycarbonate grade that was developed to meet market needs for a material combining the strength and durability of metals with lighter weight, design flexibilities, and processing economics of plastics. Lexan 500 has a high impact strength, an excellent dimensional stability, a low coefficient of thermal expan- sion, and a low water absorption rate. Lexan 500 can be used as a metal replacement in areas where designers can take advantage of the benefits of a structurally rigid thermoplastic without sacrificing impact strength, with added advantages of reduced processing costs and elimination of costly secondary finishing and assembly operations. Lexan 500 is particularly suited to applications requiring high dimensional stability and the ability to mold easily to close tolerances while maintaining excellent surface appearance. 710102. Polymer and Chemical Alloys with ABS Poly- mers. R. H. Wiswell, Marbon Chemical Div., Borg-Warner Corp. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymers are ca- pable of modification either by other polymers or by chemical additives to form alloys. ABS polymers have been successfully alloyed with polycarbonates, poly- urethanes, polyvinyl chlorides, glass fibre, and inert fillers, such as calcium carbonate, nylons, chlorinated polyeth- ylene, and chemical fire retardants. In each case the resultant products have an area of value not attainable with the basic ABS polymer. 710103. Suitability of Plastics in Designing Passenger Vehicle Components. Hermann Hablitzel, Volks- wagen AG. This report demonstrates the scope of the preliminary work required before plastics can be used in the vehicle industry. Consideration must be given to diverse factors such as the special physical properties of the material being used, the influence of the manufacturing process on the properties of the plastic components, as well as the basic design of the item being produced. Illustrated in detail is the plastic air duct used for the Volkswagen Type 411 sedan, with particular emphasis on ambient influences and combustibility. Plastics have become an accepted part of the vehicle construction scene and any increase in the use of plastics will depend upon data being made available to the engineer in usable form. 710104. The Vega Plastic Flex Fan. G. L. Fisher, C. D. Lennon and R. F. Wheaton, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., General Motors Corp. A molded one-piece plastic fan with flexible blades was developed for use in automotive vehicles to provide adequate low-speed cooling and reduced noise and horsepower at high speeds. Development was accom- plished through an extensive design, testing, and material selection program. The features of light weight, low cost, and good durability were prime considerations for use of the plastic flex fan on Chevrolet's Vega. 1971 SA E Transactions 710105. Some Effects of Curing Conditions on Adhesion to Metal Surfaces. N. L. Rogers, Bell Helicopter Co. The effect of curing temperature on the peel strength of three different adhesive systems is reported. The adhesive systems were cured at 250 F, 275 F, 300 F, 325 F, and 350 F on aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium surfaces. The adhesives were also subjected to a single and a double cure cycle on four different aluminum alloys. Peel strength was determined at ambient temperature and at -67 F. 710106. Adhesives Used in Automotive Production. Doug- las F. Weyher, Chemical Div., Chrysler Corp. This paper details five types of adhesives used in the automotive industry: evaporation or diffusion, chemically reactive, pressure sensitive, hot melts, and sealants. The adhesives included in each group are listed, along with their properties. The author feels that adhesives offer the best method of joining because of their ability to supply a uniform distribution of stresses, an air and water tight seal, vibration and sound dampening, protection from galvanic corrosion, fatigue resistance, along with the ability to join widely dissimilar materials. Eight tables summarize the various types of adhesive and their uses, bases, applications, and special properties. 710107. Stress Distribution in Adhesive Bonded Lap Joints. Glenn C. Grimes, Southwest Research Institute. Statistical data analysis techniques are applied to bonded joint experimental data.

High Strength versus Stress Relief in a Structural Bond. N. J. DeLollis, Sandia Labs. In bonding two materials differing in coefficient of expansion, one must either contain the stresses due to temperature cycling, using a rigid adhesive, or allow the two adherents to expand and contract freely, using an elastomeric adhesive. An experiment is described which demonstrates the extent that stresses can be contained when a rigid adhesive is used to bond materials of greatly different coefficients of expansion. 710109. High Performance Adhesives. S. C. Aker, Bell Helicopter Co. The ideal characteristics of a high-performance adhesive are presented here as the stress-strain data of the adhesive joint between two pieces of metal. Elongation under load and environmental compatibility are two important characteristics that determine high-performance capabil- ity, in addition to the sheer strength, fatigue strength, and cyclic creep tendencies of the material. Emphasis is on mechanical properties, and tests to determine these properties are described. 710110. Adhesive Bonding of High Modulus Composite Aircraft Structures. Samuel J. Dastin and George Lubin, Grumman Aerospace Corp. Boron-epoxy composites are presently being utilized for primary aircraft structures. The basic joining technique for these materials of construction is adhesive bonding. This presentation briefly reviews the mechanical prop- erties of adhesive-bonded composites, the techniques for manufacture, and the quality assurance necessary for acceptance of such structures. The component selected for this study is the produc- tion horizontal stabilizer of the F-14 fighter attache aircraft. This component required structural adhesive bonding between several materials, such as boron-epoxy, titanium, steel, aluminum honeycomb, and fiberglass epoxy, over the temperature range of -67 to 335 F (with data given up to 375 F). 1971 SAE Transactions 710111. The Uniflo Personal Rapid Transit System. Lloyd E. Berggren, Uniflo Systems Co. A personal rapid transit system has been developed, capable of providing urban areas with public transpor- tation service that is competitive with the automobile in speed, availability, accessibility, and comfort. The system contributes no pollution in terms of air, noise, or vibration; it is relatively small in size; and it can be installed elevated, on grade, or below grade. These qualities make it an acceptable addition to a community. Because this personal rapid transit system is highly automated, a significant reduction in the amount of labor required to provide transportation service is anticipated. This could mean that it would again be possible to make money moving people. 710112. Dual-Mode Vehicle Terminal and Network Al- ternatives for Automated Guideway Transporta- tion. David Gordon Wilson, Michael B. God- frey and Henry H. Fuller, Jr., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Terminal design has emerged as having critical impor- tance in the planning of dual-mode transportation in cities because the very high line-haul capacity of automated guideways can lead to large space requirements at entry and exit points. In this paper the influence of vehicle size, of the method of guidance and propulsion, and of the network terminal layouts on the space requirements for the overall transportation systems are discussed. Forecasts are made of the manner in which dual-mode transpor- tation will first be installed. 710113. The Impact of a Dual-Mode Transportation System on Traffic Conditions in the Detroit Area. Robert G. Stefanek, Ford Motor Co. One of the most promising of the innovative transpor- tation systems being proposed to alleviate problems caused by constantly increasing travel demands in urban areas is a dual-mode vehicle system. In such a system, automobiles are modified so that they may be operated under automatic control on certain specially constructed guideways in an urban area. This system combines the advantages of the line haul capabilities of an automated system with the distribution capabilities of the individ- ually operated automobile. In this report, the results of a study aimed at determining expected volumes on a typical dual-mode network in the Detroit area as well as determining the impact of a dual-mode system on traffic conditions in the region are presented. Trip matrices were obtained from data supplied by the Detroit Regional Transportation and Land Use Study (TALUS), and state-of-the-art traffic assignment techniques were used to assign trips to the network. It is shown that typical rush hour traffic conditions on the expressways in the region are considerably eased by the introduction of a dual-mode network. 710114. The Dynamics of Automotive Rear Axle Gear Noise. E. Paul Remmers, Research Labs., Gen- eral Motors Corp. Automotive rear axle gear noise is characterized by a tonal peak of several mph bandwidth, usually in the 40-70 mph speed range. A study of the mass-elastic system of rear axle gears predicts the existence of a nearly vertical resonance of the pinion, relative to its supports near the frequency of the observed noise peak. Experimental studies of a variety of rear axles confirm</page><page sequence="18">7101/15 - 710121 the existence of this vibration peak and its coincidence with the observed noise. The magnitude of the various orders of gear meshing quality resultant from eccentricities, wobble, heat-treat- ment distortion and higher harmonics, can be assessed by monitoring the amplitude of this resonance at specified gear meshing frequencies. 1971 SAE Transactions 710115. Rear Axle Noise Quality Inspection Method. Howard E. Fonda and Donald E. Wen te, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. For many years axle plants have needed a practical testing method for rating the noise quality of rear axle assemblies before installation in cars. This report describes the development of such a test method. Creation of noise requires an energy source. The energy source of rear axle noise is the periodic variation in tooth meshing action of the gears. The frequency of axle noise is always related to tooth mesh frequency. A previous study of rear axle gear dynamics indicated the existence of a nearly vertical resonance of rear axle pinions excited by tooth meshing action. The dynamic resonant amplitude of the motion of the pinions related directly to the in-car noise quality of the gear sets. In general, other resonances within the drive line-axle housing-suspension system can be excited by gear action and produce "axle" noise. An indication of the amplitude of the resonant member (or another responsive member within the system) directly relates to the relative noise quality of the gear set. To verify this relationship, the dynamic pinion response of a group of 30 axle assemblies was measured. The in-car noise ratings were obtained by using a jury of three experienced raters. The correlation between the dynamic pinion motion measured in a test stand and the in-car noise ratings was found to be very good, indicating the feasibility of using this method in axle plants. A statistical analysis was made of the data to . determine the degree of correlation and the validity of the data. Details of the test stand operation, noise rating method and tests results are included in the report. 1971 SAE Transactions 710116. Single Flank Testing Hypoid Gears. R. G. Munro, J. Goulder &amp; Sons Ltd. The single flank test measures the transmission error of a gear pair. The transmission error curve indicates the profile error (as described in the Gleason tooth contact analysis), and also pitch and eccentricity errors. The method is therefore valuable, not only for hypoid gear development, but also for inspection or quality control. 710117. Measuring Rolling Vibrations of Hypoid Gears. Edwin W. Newton, Advanced Products Div., Gleason Works. Rolling vibrations of hypoid gears resulting from non- conjugacy of the teeth are explained, measured, and simulated using an electromechanical exciter system. Laboratory experiments have shown that there is a relationship between angular displacement error, acous- tical gear noise, and structure-borne vibration. A new hypoid gear testing machine has been developed for making a rapid quality measurement based on the excitation of the tooth mesh frequency and its harmonics. 7101 18. The History of the Motor Home as a Recreational Vehicle. Kenneth T. Scott, Family Motor Coach Association, Inc. Through the years, the motor coach is fast becoming a new way of life. This paper will tend to highlight the progress which has developed with ingenuity. Today, the motor coach is a self-contained, motor driven home, complete with all the neccessary conveniences, and in some cases, even the luxuries. It is finding a way in our everyday living as people seek more leisure time and as families anticipate* traveling together. 710119. Automotive Forgings - Powder Leads to Higher Precision. M. P. Jarrett and P. K. Jones, G. K. N. Forgings &amp; Castings Ltd. The consistent quality and good mechanical properties of hot forgings have been used to advantage by designers for many years. Forging developments giving improved material utilization and closer dimensional tolerance are successful for specific applications. A new process, powder forging, has the potential to provide precision forgings for a wide variety of components. Combining the advantages of conventional powder metallurgy with those of hot forging, it produces forgings of close tolerance and fine detail with properties comparable to wrought mate- rial. The process gives scope for the reduction or elimination of machining, and already a variety of components have been made and successfully tested. 1971 SAE Transactions 710120.

A Study of Heavy-Vehicle Underride Guards. Norman J. DeLeys and Melvin O. Ryder, Jr., Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. Twelve full-scale tests have been performed to investigate 83</page><page sequence="19">710123-710130 84 the underride problem and to determine the effectiveness of several specific guard designs in preventing underride type collisions. Initial tests were performed using a rigid flat plate underride guard positioned against an SAE barrier. Later tests were conducted using specific guard designs mounted on the rear of tandem axle flatbed and van trailers. Parameters studied include impacting vehicle size and weight, impact velocity, underride guard ground clearance height, rigid and yielding guards, frame and frameless (monocoque) trailer target vehicles, and sym- metrical (on-center) and unsymmetrical (off-center) im- pacts. Tests were conducted at impact velocities from 30-40 mph. Guard heights of 18 and 24 in. were investigated using cars ranging in weight from 1600-5150 lb. Data obtained from these tests include deceleration of the impacting automobiles, loading experienced by the underride guards, and high-speed motion pictures of the collision sequences. In addition to the experimental effort, mathematical modeling of the underride collision was performed using a system of discrete masses and springs to represent the impacting car and truck underride guard. Crash test data were used to define the force-deflection properties for the various springs representing structural components of the automobile. Simulations were run for a series of underride guard force magnitudes and wave forms to examine the effects of underride guard force characteristics on the impacting vehicle. Conclusions, based on the results of the full-scale crash tests and the computer simulations, are drawn concerning various aspects of the underride problem such as guard strength requirements, guard ground clearances, and the force-stroke requirements for yielding guard designs. Effects of differences in car weights and sizes, and truck-trailer structures, on the general underride guard problem are also considered. 1971 SAE Transactions 710123. Field Assisted Glass Sealing. G. Wallis, P. R. Mallory &amp; Co. Inc. A new technique is described which seals glass-to-metal and insulator-to-insulator at relatively low temperatures and short times.

This paper describes the sealing procedure, surface preparation, applications, and properties of the seal. 1971 SAE Transactions 710125. Thermoelectric Sealing of Windshields as Prac- ticed in Europe. D. S. Butler, Bitumen Industries Ltd. Direct glazing of automobile fixed glass is gaining wider production usage in Europe. Objections on cost grounds are being overcome. New systems and compounds are being developed and employed. The thermoelectric system, with its ease of handling and installation, and lack of associated cleanup problems, seems to be the most popular method in use. 710126. RTV Silicone Adhesive Sealants. S. B. Hamilton, Jr., Silicone Products Dept., General Electric Co. Room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone sealants are discussed in terms of the curing chemistry and the relation of the chemistry to the physical properties. Individual properties such as adhesion and modulus characteristics and their relations to overall sealant performance are also discussed. The paper describes a new group of silicone sealants having properties such as high strength, "knotty tear," primerless adhesion, non- corrosiveness to copper, flame retardancy, and low modulus; pressure-sensitive adhesives are also discussed. These newly developed properties, coupled with the excellent performance characteristics of silicones and the ideal handling properties of RTV sealants, account for the increasing utilization of silicones in applications once served exclusively by organic sealants. 710129. The Detroit Diesel Crosshead Piston. N. H. Hamparian and C. S. Hoffman, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. A new piston concept has been developed for Detroit Diesel series 71 engines that differs substantially from pistons in any other engine now in volume production. This paper discusses the design objectives, design evo- lution, types of testing, and test results. Some of the topics discussed include top ring groove wear effects, temperature measurements and results, including "cocktail shaker" oil cooling effects, reduction in pin bushing wear, and various ruggedness and dura- bility tests. 710130.

This paper describes the development of a diesel family of 6, 8, and 12 cyl engines with a particularly compact design and offering direct injection for the purpose of providing engines of high performance for all industrial purposes operated at relatively high speed. The essential results of the development work are described, and brief accounts are given of special purpose applications in which definite speeds are specified, such as for driving electric generators and pumps. A complementary series with a larger stroke now under development, will utilize practically all parts of the original series.</page><page sequence="20">710131-710136 710131. Cummins V504 and V555 Engines. J. L. Butler, R. W. Dugan and E. H. Kemp, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The Cummins V504 and V555 engines were developed for construction, industrial, agricultural, marine and medium duty automotive market requirements of lightweight, compact diesel engines in the 185-240 hp range. The engine design and development objectives were to obtain high reliability and durability combined with good overall efficiency in a compact package size. These objectives were achieved by careful attention to design details, combustion system development and extensive laboratory and field evaluation. 710132. Diesel Fuel Injection Viewed as a Jet Phenom- enon. R. B. Melton, Jr., Southwest Research Institute. The theory of submerged jets is applied quantitatively and qualitatively to diesel fuel sprays, based on simple considerations of the inherent validity of the single- particle "ballistic" approach. Approximate theoretical results are obtained for penetration velocity, penetration versus time, and fuel-air ratio within the spray. Modeling experiments are discussed and the jet approach used to explain two types of diesel combustion situations-fuel entrapment by insufficient penetration in the presence of air swirl and the efficacy of the MAN process. 710133. Experimental and Computational Considerations of the Compression Ignition of Homogeneous Fuel-Oxidant Mixtures. G. A. Karim, University of Calgary, Canada; and H. C. Watson, Uni- versity of Melbourne, Australia. This paper describes procedures for predicting the course of reaction and the onset of autoignition in homogeneous fuel-air mixtures using detailed chemical kinetic data and considering hydrogen gas as a fuel. Experimental results from both a motored autoigniting engine and a pneu- matically driven compression apparatus are then com- pared with computational predictions. It is shown that depending on the reliability and completeness of the kinetic scheme employed, reasonably good agreement between computed and observed pressure development records can be obtained. 1971 SAE Transactions 710134. A Simple Method for the Calculation of Heat Release Rates in Diesel Engines Based on the Fuel Injection Rate. N. D. Whitehouse and R. J. B. Way, University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology, England. Heat release data have been obtained by analysis of cylinder pressure diagrams from a variety of engines, 2-stroke and 4-stroke, small (3.4 in. bore) to medium size (12 in. bore) over ranges of power, speed and air supply conditions. These data have been used to develop a method of calculating heat release rates suitable for performance calculations using a digital computer. Rela- tively simple equations are used based on a single zone model for conditions in the cylinder. The correlation is primarily empirical, based on a simple model for the rate of mixing between fuel and air, but the chemical kinetics of the burning process is also involved in the prediction of the initial burning rate. Some limitations of the simplified model used are made apparent by the experimental data, but these may be overcome to some extent by the use of empirical coefficients. 710135. An Examination of Some of the Errors Normally Associated with the Calculation of Apparent Rates of Combustion Heat Release in Engines. G. A. Karim, University of Calgary, Canada; and M. O. Khan, Imperial College, England. The rate of heat release analysis of combustion processes in a diesel engine, derived from knowledge of cylinder pressure time records, has now developed to be an effective tool for considering and evaluating the progress of these processes for research and development purposes. This paper examines some of the main errors and assumptions normally associated with the calculation of apparent rates of combustion heat release in engines, and suggests ways to improve the accuracy of these calcu- lations. « 710136. The Effect of Gasoline Volatility on Emissions and Driveability. P. J. Clarke, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co. The volatility of motor gasoline has always been a key factor in good car performance. It continues to be important to the driveability and emissions of late model cars equipped with exhaust and evaporative control systems. Three research studies have helped to define the role of volatility in late model vehicles. The first, a consumer reaction survey, shows that driveability in cold weather is markedly improved by high mid-fill and back-end volatility. Results from the second program indicate that cars with exhaust and evaporative control systems will perform satisfactorily on fuels of current front-end volatility levels. There will not be a problem with odor in a garage even with fuels of high front-end volatility. Also, varying front-end volatility from low to high levels did not significantly increase the average start-up time for a group of eight cars under hot start conditions. The third study indicates that fuels of high front-end volatility give lower exhaust hydrocarbons than fuels of lower volatility at 40 F and 70 F. Now, in addition to the need for high volatility for start-up in cold weather, there is the added incentive of lower exhaust hydro- carbons. 85</page><page sequence="21">710137-710142 86 710137. Measuring Vehicle Driveability. R. L. Everett, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Emission controls, both exhaust and evaporative, have made it much more difficult to achieve satisfactory driveability. Since driveability is becoming a more critical factor, objective rating techniques are desirable. A surgemeter has been developed for objectively measuring vehicle surge, one driveability factor. A comparison of surgemeter ratings with surge ratings of expert drivers indicate that the surgemeter objectively measures surge. In one investigation, the surgemeter indicated that vehicle surge increased as the amount of exhaust gas recirculation required for NOx control increased. In another investi- gation, the surgemeter was used to compare surge in seven different vehicles as part of a more comprehensive vehicle driveability rating program. Good, overall vehicle driveability implies that the driver is satisfied with the automobile's power train operation. Driveability measurements generally employ subjective "seat-of-the-pants" techniques and jargon to describe performance. These techniques and jargon are described and defined in this paper. 710138. Passenger Car Driveability in Cool Weather. J. D. Benson, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp., H. A. Bigley, Jr., Gulf Research and Devel- opment Co.; and J. L. Keller, Union Oil Co. During March 1969, the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) conducted a test program at Pasco, Wash., to investigate a driveability test procedure and the effects of fuel volatility on driveability during cool weather (30-50 F). Fifteen late-model automobiles and eight fuels with different volatility characteristics were evaluated. Drive- ability was rated subjectively during cold-start and driveaway, and after the car had warmed up. For the cold phase, driveability was related to fuel volatility as defined by the front-end and mid-boiling range of the fuel distillation curves. However, driveability during the warm phase was not affected by fuel volatility within the range of fuels tested. 710139. Pumpability of Multigrade Engine Oils at Low Temperature. M. F. Smith, Jr. and J. P. Graham, Enjay Additives Laboratory. The low temperature pumpability performance of multi- grade engine oils was evaluated in several U. S. and European engines. Test oils included both experimental formulations and commercial service station oils; test temperatures ranged between -20 F and 0 F. The time for oil to reach engine rocker arms after startup at -15 F and -20 F was not related to low temperature lubricant properties such as pour point and Brookfield viscosity. Pumpability, that is, oil gallery pressurization rate, of the oils improved markedly in successive cold temperature starts, probably due to fuel dilution and shearing of microstructures in the oil. Engine design features can significantly affect pumpability performance. Discussion: R. W. Schrum, Rohm and Haas Co.; C. K. Murphy, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and W. A.

McLaughlin, Hercules, Inc. A study of the low-temperature pumpability of multigrade motor oils was conducted to answer questions raised by car manufacturers and fleet operators in northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is shown that the oil's pumpability can be predicted with the use of a Tilt Can Pour test. This test, in turn, was used to evaluate the effects of V.l. improver type and concentration, pour depressant, and field service on pourability. 710141. Effects of Engine Oil Composition on Oil Con- sumption. Douglas S. Orrin and Bryan W. Coles, Chevron Research Co. Radioactive oils were run in a laboratory V-8 engine to determine the effects of viscosity and volatility on oil consumption. Using a tritium tracer method, very precise oil consumption rate measurements were obtained. The consumption rates of 14 test oils, blended from two crude sources, were measured at different engine speed and load conditions. To compare test oils run on different days a computerized multiple regression analysis was required to compensate for daily variations in oil consumption. Another computer aided statistical analysis related oil consumption rates to viscosity and volatility. Both hypothetical and empirical equations were used. Field tests were run to obtain a correlation with the laboratory test. Volatility was found to be the most important single characteristic affecting oil consumption. Smaller and less consistent consumption differences between oils were found in the field tests than in the laboratory engine. 1971 SAE Transactions 710142. Some Effects of Exhaust Gas Recirculation Upon Automotive Engine Intake System Deposits and Crankcase Lubricant Performance. A. F. Gerber and R. G. Smith, Jr., Automotive Lab., Cities Service Oil Co. With control of oxides of nitrogen from automobile exhaust scheduled for 1971 in California and expected to be applied nationwide in the future, the recirculation of exhaust gas appears promising as a method of lowering NOx emissions. This paper discusses work done to evaluate effects of exhaust gas recirculation on intake system cleanliness and crankcase lubricant performance.</page><page sequence="22">710143-710147 Intake system effects were evaluated with respect to the formation of deposits in the carburetor, intake manifold and ports, and intake valve tulips.

Cylinder Gas Composition of Small 2-Stroke Cycle Gasoline Engine. Shunichi Ohigashi and Yoshisuke Hamamoto, Kyoto University. In a 2-stroke cycle crankcase-scavenged gasoline engine, the compositions of cylinder gas and exhaust gas were investigated by analysis of the sampled gas extracted from the cylinder and exhaust pipe. As is well known, the combustion process taking place in a 2-stroke cycle gasoline engine has cycle-by-cycle variations. In this study, a new method controlling the operation of the sampling valve was applied, which enabled us to select cycles showing the same peak pressure and to extract a combustion gas produced by the similar combustion process. From these data the following were confirmed: 1. For estimating the composition of combustion gases, simple equations of combustion reactions are available. 2. The most reliable values estimating the scavenging properties may be calculated from the change of 02 concentrations of sampled gases before and after scav- enging. 3. It is necessary to select the gas sampling cycle by the cylinder pressure, because the scavenging process is affected by the combustion process in the preceding cycle. 4. No remarkable uneven local composition is ob- served at the time of spark ignition. Discussion: Peter W. Brown, Outboard Marine Corp.; Authors' closure 1971 SAE Transactions 710144. Measuring the Trapping Efficiency of Internal Combustion Engines Through Continuous Ex- haust -Gas Analysis. E. W. Huber, Institut fuer Motorenbau, Germany. A practical method to determine conveniently the effec- tive cylinder charge in an internal combustion engine through a continuous exhaust gas analysis is described. For gasoline engines, the oxygen content of the exhaust gas is monitored and for diesel engines, n-butane is used as a tracer gas. The method can be used on 2-stroke and 4-stroke cycle engines. The theoretical basis of the method is discussed and the limits of the application are shown. Actual test results obtained with test engines, which were especially prepared for zero scavenging and for controlled scavenging with air only or with an air/fuel mixture, are quoted.

Oggero, Laboratori di Gasdinamica, Fiat. The problem of scavening in any two-stroke engine requires highly sophisticated research methods. To obtain satisfactory results it is necessary to investigate the phenomenon under all its aspects, often resorting simul- taneously to different qualitative and quantitative pro- cedures with different degrees of approximation. The paper describes methods developed by Fiat Gas Dynamics Laboratories and presents, in particular, the fundamental characteristics of a dynamic test bench designed to provide a highly severe simulation of the actual process and to yield considerable technical- economical advantages. This test bench, though devised and used mainly for medium and large engines, is the clearest example of the possibilities derived from grouping all these research programs at a center specialized in the field of fluid dynamics. 710146. Fiat Research on Scavenging of 2-Stroke Large Bore Engines. G. Ciliberto, Fiat. This paper was prepared after a brief survey of the scavenging systems development, from the birth of the diesel 2-stroke cycle and after a similar report of the research methods. The results are described of the research carried out by Fiat on the scavenging of the 2-stroke large bore engines. A report is also given of the results obtained through lab tests at the Fiat Gas Dynamics Labs., and on the full size engines, which makes it possible to follow the evaluation of the Fiat scavenging, mainly during the last 30 years. These test results were then compared with the ones obtained, the method of research being the same, with other well known 2-stroke diesel engines scavenging systems. 710147. The Vega 2300 Engine.

The objectives for this all new small car included: 1. Mini compact size. 2. Low cost of ownership based on initial price, fuel consumption, reliability, durability, and serviceability. 3. Product superiority over other subcompacts in appearance, comfort and features, ride and handling, and performance. To meet these objectives, it was necessary to design and develop a unique unitized body, new seats, front suspension, steering, manual transmission, optional over- head cam engine, and many other new components. The design of these components to meet the objectives is discussed, as well as resolution of some of the devel- opment problems that occurred. 710150. Vega 2300. L. E. Reuss and C. N.

This design oriented paper provides an introduction to the fracture mechanics parameters controlling below-yield- strength-fractures and subcriticai crack growth, due to either fatigue loading or environmental attack. Emphasis has been placed on those basic fracture control concepts, which can aid the designer in material selection, to prevent the abovementioned occurrences. The major concepts that have been outlined within the paper are: (a) the elastic crack tip stress field and its magnitude, as measured by the stress intensity factor, (b) the relationship between the stress intensity factor and the material's fracture toughness, (c) the small scale yield model and the plastic zone correction, (d) the relationship between the range in the stress intensity factor and the rate of fatigue crack growth, and (e) a quantitative measure of a material's resistance to environmental attack under static loading. 1971 SAE Transactions 710152. What the Designer Should Know About Fracture Mechanics Testing. G. M. Sinclair, University of Illinois. This paper reviews some typical specimen designs, procedures, and important variables involved in fracture mechanics testing.

Proving Ground Testing of a Brushless Electric- Wheel System. C. W. King and George C. Collins, Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp. An electric-wheel vehicle propulsion system has several potential advantages in the area of mobility, vehicle- design flexibility, engine operation flexibility, adaptability to a variety of powerplants, and the accomplishment of multiple functions. Such a system, which consists of six wheel-mounted brushless self-synchronous motors pow- ered by an engine-driven alternator, has been applied to an M-35 truck as a testbed vehicle. This paper describes the testing of the electric-wheel testbed; the results of special interest to fuel economy, dynamic braking, wheel speed control, stability at low speeds, gradeability, mobility under off-highway condi- tions, and durability. These results give rise to the possible future application of this type of electric drive to a variety of special military and commercial vehicles. 710156. Advances in Automatic Gaging Techniques. Carl A. Griffith, The Bendix Corp. Rising labor costs, increased safety standards, pollution control requirements, and costly warranty teardowns have made 100% inspection of more components necessary. The changing technology of automatic gaging and the development of new gaging devices along with related peripheral equipment have increased the possibility of inspecting parts more reliably for more conditions and at a higher cycle rate than on previous equipment. Some inspection equipment becomes part of a parts- handling system whereby the machine receives parts from previous automation, transfers them through the machine while inspecting, and deposits them onto the succeeding automation. Other equipment serves as a gaging station inter- connected to a transfer system with no parts handling. This type of system provides feedback signals for part disposition or evaluation. Another type of machine is a "free-standing" auto- matic. No other parts-handling system is used and the parts are loaded either manually or by a parts feeder directly into the parts-handling system of the gaging machine. After inspection the parts are deposited into the customer's receiving equipment. 710157. An Analysis of Body Structures. K. Kirioka, Y. Ohkubo and Y. Hotta, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. In this paper the matrix displacement method is em- ployed. The finite element method treats the car body as arbitrary shells, whereby idealization of the car body structure becomes possible. The paper takes into consid- eration not only the plane stress, but also the bending stress. The program details which include an automatic input and output are described. The first calculation example shows a comparison between classic and present analyses of plates and shells, demonstrating the satisfactory accuracy of this method. The next example shows an application to the whole and local structures of an actual car, a technique which makes possible reasonable body design analysis. 710158. The Effect of Temperature Variations in the Engine Combustion Chamber on Formation and Emission of Nitrogen Oxides. L. J. Muzio, Columbia University; E. S. Starkman, Univer- sity of California, Berkeley; and L. S. Caretto, Imperial College, England. Temperature variation in the combustion chamber of spark ignition engines is a vital factor in determining exhaust pollutant concentrations. Oxides of nitrogen are particularly affected. The temperature and concentration variations were investigated both theoretically and exper- imentally. A nonuniform model of the combustion process was developed. Calculations based on this model show that a temperature difference of the order of 600 K can be established across the cylinder. The validity of this model was substantiated by results of infrared spectroscopic measurements in the operating engine cylinder. The kinetic mechanism for formation of nitric oxide was used, along with the nonuniform combustion model, to investigate the formation of nitric oxide in the cylinder. Results of the kinetic calculation show that the temper- ature gradient across the cylinder has a profound effect on the nitric oxide formation. The calculations are shown to be in agreement with results of direct cylinder sampling for a variety of engine variables including fuel-air ratio, spark timing, and engine speed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710159. Ignition, Combustion, and Exhaust Emissions of Lean Mixtures in Automotive Spark Ignition Engines. Takeshi Tanuma, Kenichi Sasaki, Touru Kaneko and Haj ime Kawasaki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Misfire and cycle-to-cycle combustion variation are both serious problems in securing good engine performance and low exhaust emissions in the case of using extremely lean mixtures. Making some modifications in ignition system and in combustion chamber, and increasing the mixture turbulence, we examined their effects upon the lean limit, the engine performance, and the exhaust emissions. It was found that gap width and gap projection of a spark plug and spark energy as well as mixture 89</page><page sequence="25">710160-710165 90 turbulence had a great effect on extending the lean limit and improving engine performance with lean mixtures. A compact combustion chamber is preferable for lean mixture operation. Smooth operation of the engine can be maintained even at retarded spark timing by applying the above-mentioned items and providing hot intake air to the engine. Consequently, exhaust emissions, including hy- drocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, can be substantially reduced. 1971 SAE Transactions 710160. Experience on the Use of Fuel-Air Explosions for Controlled Earthmoving. Charles D. Wood, A. R. Nye and Rosser B. Melton, Southwest Research Institute; and D. L. Craft, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research &amp; Development Center. A novel earthmoving machine making use of fuel-air explosions for the displacement of soil is presently under development.

A Dielectric Cell Technique for the Continuous Measurement of Fuel/Air Ratio Under Transient Conditions of Engine Operation. W. D. Mills and G. A. Harrow, Shell Research Ltd., England. A technique, based on the unique relationship that exists between the dielectric constant of a fully oxidized exhaust gas sample and the fuel/air ratio of the unburnt mixtures, is presented. To measure the dielectric constant a special cell has been constructed through which the fully oxidized gases are passed. The capacitance of the cell is then directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the gases so that changes in mixture strength are detected as changes in cell capacitance. These changes in cell capacitance are measured electronically and are continu- ously recorded as an analogue voltage on a chart recorder. The cell design is such that the residence time of the gases is 1/10 s at a flow rate of 21 min i. Discussion: W. F. Marshall and Authors' closure 1971 SAE Transactions 710163. An Empirical Model for Correlating Cycle- by-Cycle Cylinder Gas Motion and Combustion Variations of an SI Engine. R. K. Barton, S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. The cycle-by-cycle variations of the combustion process of an SI engine result in cycle-by-cycle variations of the cylinder pressure development histories. Many investi- gators have postulated that these pressure variations are due to cycle-by-cycle variations of the gas motion near the spark plug at the time of ignition. This investigation was undertaken to determine if such a correlation does in fact exist. The cycle-by-cycle combustion variations of a CFR- RDH engine were examined in terms of the cycle-by-cycle pressure development histories. A constant temperature hot-film probe was used to determine the velocity variations from cycle to cycle of the motored engine in the vicinity of the spark plug at the crank angles at which ignition would take place under firing conditions. The standard deviations of the gas velocity near the spark plug were correlated to the standard deviations of the crank angle at which maximum pressure occurred for different operating variables. The correlation was made using a model which assumed that the time required to burn the same initial volume of charge each cycle was dependent only on this velocity. With this model a correlation of 0.975 was obtained between the standard deviation of the velocity and the angle of occurrence of maximum pressure. This led the authors to conclude that cycle-by-cycle combustion variations are caused by cycle-by-cycle variations of the gas velocity in the vicinity of the spark plug at the time of ignition. 1971 SAE Transactions 710164. Lean Automotive Engine Operation - Hydro- carbon Exhaust Emissions and Combustion Char- acteristics. James G. Hansel, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Some of the major factors contributing to cycle-to-cycle combustion variations in an automotive engine have been determined over a wide range of air/fuel ratios. The combustion variations lead to a general degradation of the combustion processes at very lean air/fuel ratios, which, in turn, places limits on operating an engine very lean to achieve low exhaust emissions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710165. An Analog Computer Method for Determining "g" Loads and Resulting Motions in Automobile and Truck Wheel-Frame Systems. George M. Kurajian and Harold Burr, The University of Michigan. A general analog computer procedure is presented for the dynamic analysis of a selected realistic model of an automobile or truck vehicle wheel-frame system. The elements of the model are assigned a set of values based on a preselected vehicle, and the model is then subjected to a number of inputs which correspond to test track road disturbances at various speeds. This procedure is suc- cessively applied to a number of typical vehicles. Time- varying values of wheel spindle and frame reaction "g" loads, accelerations, and displacements are recorded, and illustrative waveshapes are depicted. Tables indicating extreme values of these quantities are also included.</page><page sequence="26">710166-710171 710166. An Investigation of the Adjustable Element Concept for Design of Automotive Exhaust Mufflers. William S. Gatley, University of Missouri-Rolla; and Phillip S. Gegesky, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. The feasibility of employing a muffler with adjustable internal elements as an aid for design of production automotive exhaust mufflers is investigated. Design and internal geometry of the muffler are described and illustrated. Equipment and methods for measuring the acoustic reflection and transmission characteristics of the muffler for various adjustments and pure tone frequencies are presented. Results are analyzed and compared with performance data obtained when the source of sound is simulated engine exhaust noise. The value of the adjust- able element Goncept for design of automotive mufflers, and the relative merits of pure tone and exhaust spectrum analyses, are discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710167. A Mathematical Model of the Chrysler Hyge Impact Simulator. S. L. Milan, Chrysler Corp.; and R. W. Hegel, Monroe Auto Equipment Co. The Chrysler Hyge impact simulator permits full-scale laboratory simulation of the deceleration experienced by an automobile passenger compartment during impact. The need to duplicate a great variety of deceleration pulse shapes necessitates a large number of operating param- eters. Unfortunately, this large number of parameters precludes easy determination of the relationships between parameter selections and desired pulse shapes. This paper describes the development of a mathe- matical model and digital computer program used by the Chrysler Engineering Office to predict the response of the impact simulator for a given set of parameters. The principle elements of the model deal with unsteady compressible gas flow and the effect of the resulting forces on the sled motion. The modeling of the metering pin is of particular importance, since the characteristic shape of the acceleration pulse is limited by the pin contour. With the aid of this model it is possible to specify the complete set of operating parameters needed to simulate a desired pulse shape. This eliminates the need for costly, time consuming, cut-and-try experimentation. 710168. Quality Control of Elastomeric Compounds by Gas Chromatographic Fingerprinting. Henry E. Manturuk, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. Gas chromatographic fingerprinting of elastomeric ma- terials is discussed in this paper. The development of this analytic technique, the parameters, and the testing procedure are given. The capabilities of this technique are the identification of basic elastomers, the blending of these elastomers, the quantitative analysis of ash content, and the use of this method in controlling incoming shipments of material. 710169. The Chrysler Method of Carburetor Idle Flow Correlation. R. S. Harris and A. L. Fraccarolli, Chrysler Corp. In the continuing search for reduced exhaust emissions from automotive engines, tighter controls on production carburetor fuel-air ratio delivery became necessary. Idle fuel and airflow measurement assumed major importance due to the influence of idle set points on exhaust emissions and on the part throttle flow curve of the carburetor. This paper details the development of idle fuel and airflow measurement transfer systems to correlate data between test stations, including the use of carburetors locked in the idle position. Matched sets of sonic flow nozzles are currently in use at each test location as a basis for defining carburetor idle ajrflow. Fuel flow, using a test fluid developed specifically for this application, is defined by a simple, accurate weight time calibrator. The current system requires only the transmittal of data between test locations and is now entering its second year of production application. 710170. Ford Motor Company's Mobile Emissions Test Laboratory. C. W. Schwartz, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes design features and construction details of Ford Motor Company's recently commissioned Mobile Emissions Test Laboratory (METL). The lab contains all facilities - chassis dynamometer, gas analyz- ers, test environment, and support services - necessary for the conduct of Federal emissions tests anywhere in the country. The METL is contained within a large semitrailer compartmented into three sections for instrumentation, vehicle test, and support equipment. The center vehicle test section is expanded on site, providing an enclosed 13 X 30 ft area with built-in chassis dynamometer. A convenient feature is the "drive-through" for test cars. METL can operate at temperatures as low as -10 F and has provided accurate, reliable results on field test programs. 710171. General Motors Mobile Emission Laboratory. W. F. Repphun, General Motors Corp. This paper describes the General Motors Mobile Emission Laboratory. Information is given on the design criteria and concept, construction features of the trailer and a discussion of the instrumentation needed to conduct vehicle emission tests. Primary applications include customer car field sur- veillance and assistance to assembly plant emission * testing. The mobile laboratory has a temperature con- trolled area, allowing testing regardless of outside weather conditions. Both concentration and mass emission testing 91</page><page sequence="27">710172-710176 92 can be done with sufficient flexibility to adapt to future emission standards. A custom built semi-trailer was chosen to fulfill the needs of the mobile lab. A design study was undertaken to determine the best way all the necessary components could be packaged in a semi-trailer body. 710172. Some Problem Areas in Engine Simulation. G. L. Borman, P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. Problem areas in engine simulation where the required information is lacking are discussed. The need for improved heat transfer, combustion, friction, and turbo- charger models is discussed as are instrumentation needs for measurements of accurate pressure, radiant heat transfer, time-varying cylinder velocities, and instanta- neous mass flow rates. 710173. A Comprehensive Digital Computer Program to Simulate a Compression Ignition Engine In- cluding Intake and Exhaust Systems. Rowland S. Benson, The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, England. Two comprehensive programs for the complete cycle synthesis for compression ignition engines are briefly described. The programs include the intake pipes, the exhaust pipes, and the turbocharger if this is fitted. The combustion in the power cycle is represented by a simple heat release model as described by Whitehouse, et al, and the heat tranfer is computed by the method of Annand. The wave action in the intake and exhaust system and the gas exchange process in the cylinder are computed by methods described by the author in earlier papers. Recent improvements include heat transfer in the pipe system, supersonic flow, and the exact dimensioning of the pipe system. The matching of the turbocharger within the engine is described, based on quasi steady methods, and a discussion of the possible limitations of this approach in given. Comparison of experimental results taken on engine tests with the computed predictions, are given. The use of the program to facilitate engine design is illustrated with examples. 710174. Computer Simulation of Engine Gas Dynamic Process: A Design Package. E. J. Wright, Queen's University, Ontario. A computer program package is described for use in simulating the unsteady gas dynamic processes occurring in a reciprocating engine system. The program package is written in Fortran IV and utilizes the Method of Characteristics to solve the general equations of one- dimensional unsteady flow in the presence of heat transfer, wall friction, and entropy gradients. It is arranged in a generalized form to allow ready application to a variety of engine and duct configurations. A subroutine library of standard engine/duct boundary conditions has been developed which, together with the unsteady flow program, can model a desired system configuration with no further programming required from the designer. The paper describes the development of the program package and of some of the duct boundary subroutines. A single cylinder two stroke engine model with intake and exhaust ducts is used to demonstrate the application of the package. Computer run times for typical test runs are of the order of one to three minutes on an IBM 360 Model 50 Computer, confirming that the program is an eco- nomical means of predicting system performance. 710175. Experimental and Analytical Scavenging Studies on a Two-Cycle Opposed Piston Diesel Engine. F. J. Wallace and P. R. Cave, Bath University of Technology, England. As part of a general program of work on opposed piston compression ignition engines operating at high output, it was considered that the scavenging of the engine merited separate attention. Scavenging is of vital importance in the achievement of high output and no information on the operation of opposed piston engines at high boost was available. Further, some idea of the scavenging efficiency was needed for theoretical work proceeding in parallel with the experimental investigation. For the two reasons given above, it was decided that the scavenging of the opposed piston engine operating at elevated pressure should be examined experimentally and an attempt made to relate the measurements to the various theoretical models available. An introduction to scavenging theory will be given followed by a discussion of experimental methods. A description of the apparatus and a comparison between experimental results and the various theoretical models will complete the paper. 710176. Mathematical Simulation of a Large Turbo- charged Two-Stroke Diesel Engine. Ernst E. Streit, Computer Sciences Corp.; and Gary L. Borman, University of Wisconsin. The multicylinder turbocharged engine was simulated by assuming each cylinder undergoes the same thermody- namic cycle. The model for the cylinder includes instan- taneous heat transfer, homogeneous combustion burning rates, and a scavenging model which allows any inter- mediate mode between perfect scavenging and complete mixing. Metal surface temperatures are calculated by use of cyclic energy balances. The air receiver pressure is assumed constant and the exhaust manifold pressure is calculated by use of a filling and emptying process. The turbocharger turbine is analyzed on a quasi-steady basis with given mass flow-expansion ratio characteristics and</page><page sequence="28">710177-710181 efficiency-velocity ratio curves. Steady flow is assumed and experimental performance was used to model the compressor. Engine and turbocharger operating condi- tions are adjusted in the program until an energy balance is attained between the engine and the turbocharger. Comparisons between experimental and simulated data are presented and the results of parametric variations are discussed. Discussion: Meinrad K.

Ledger and S. Walmsley, Univer- sity of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology, England. A simulation model of a turbocharged diesel engine has been set up on an analog computer for studying the performance under transient load conditions. The method uses simplified compressor and turbine characteristics and empirical relationships for the engine thermodynamics. Steady-state results and transient responses for various load changes are compared with corresponding results from a similar digital model and with test-bed results where available. Proposed improvements to the analog model include the transfer of the compressor and turbine characteristics to the digital section of a hybrid computer which will allow a considerably better representation of the turbo- charger to be obtained. 710178. Load Support Capability of Flat Plates of Various Shapes in Soils. A. D. Sela and I. R. Ehrlich, Davidson Lab. A fundamental problem in soil-vehicle mechanics is the ability to predict accurately the load-sinkage character- istics of simple flat plates in homogeneous soils. This paper attempts to develop a more general theory of plate sinkage which will be applicable to a wide variety of soils, sinkages, plate sizes, and plate shapes. In the study to determine the strength characteristics of soils, many carefully performed tests must be conducted to eliminate the effects of the natural variability of the soil which can easily mask out the parameters being measured. 1971 SA E Transactions 710179. Rate Effects in Soil Cutting. R. D. Wismer and H. J. Luth, Deere &amp; Co. The effect of travel rate on force response of soil cutting blades is considered and found to include inertial, shear strength, and failure mode phenomena. The inertial effect is related to the acceleration of the cut soil mass and a simple equation is extracted from the literature and shown to correlate with the test results of flat inclined blades. The blade cutting force of saturated clay is found to exhibit a pronounced shear strength-rate effect which can be predicted from cone penetrometer measurements. Travel rate is found to change the mode of failure of certain soil-blade systems. 710180. Multiple Rolling Tire Sinkage and Drag Inter- action Effects. David C. Kraft and Henry Luming, University of Dayton. A study was made of the influence of adjacent loaded areas on the performance of rolling aircraft tires on soil runways. These tire/soil interaction effects which occur in multiple tire landing gears were evaluated based on sinkage and drag. The total study consisted of four parts. Three of the parts have been completed. The fourth part, which is an experimental effort, is still in progress. The first part consisted of an evaluation of existing full scale field test data from aircraft or test carts operating with multiple tire configurations. The second part was a Dual Plate Vertical Load Test Program which yielded sinkage interaction effects from single and dual plate load tests in sand and clay. An analytical study was made in the third part using a lumped parameter iteration technique together with an elastic-plastic soil model for studying adjacent load interaction effects. The results show that definite benefits in terms of rolling drag reduction can be gained by proper use and spacing of dual and tandem tires when operating on sand and clay type soils. 710181. Soil/Wheel Interaction at High Speed. B. M. Crenshaw, Lockheed-Georgia Co. Tests of wheels towed through soft soils at high speed have revealed interaction phenomena that are important for design of various high speed vehicles, especially aircraft which are strongly influenced during takeoff and landing by the wheel drag loads. Available data shows that high drag loads are encountered upon starting, followed by a minimum at approximately 20 knots and then a second drag load peak in the 40 - 80 knot range. Recent tests at the NASA Landing Loads Track have shown that the rut depths have the same velocity relationships as the drag loads. Tests were conducted with a 29 X 11 - 10 8PR tire loaded to 5000 lb on buckshot clay at CBR 1.5, 2.3, and 4.4 and at CBR 1.5 on sand. An analytical model to predict wheel drag load and rutting is developed from a combination of currently used empirical drag load and rut depth prediction methods and high speed interaction factors which produces fair agreement with measured ruts and drag loads over the velocity range from zero to approximately 100 knots. Both the tests and analysis indicate that the interaction is most pronounced for soft surfaces and high tire pressures; it is reduced if either the tire pressure is reduced or if the soil strength increases. 93</page><page sequence="29">710182-710190 94 710182. Evolution of the Air Cushion. W. C. House, W. J. Eggington and C. A. Lysdale, Aerojet-General Corp. The characteristics of the supporting air cushion system are key to the cross-country mobility and Overwater performance of air cushion vehicles and surface effect ships. The direction of developments in this technology is discussed, and the primary cushion design variables are identified. The historical sequence of air cushion devel- opment is reviewed, and it is concluded that current and future advancement will be based on "3rd generation" systems, in which the cushion system design is tailored to the specific application. 710183. A Review of the Status of the Technology of the Air Cushion Vehicle. P. A. Sullivan, University of Toronto. This paper reviews the current status of the technology of the air cushion vehicle (ACV). ACV economics are examined to suggest priorities for research and devel- opment and to illustrate the effects of various design decisions. The basic features of and problems associated with flexible skirt systems are discussed. Problems in propulsion, structures, control, and other areas are reviewed, and topics for research are indicated. The paper concludes by suggesting that much more development work is required to bring the vehicle to a reasonable state of maturity. Operating costs, controllability and propul- sion are noted as requiring special attention. However, solutions to many of the problems seem possible, so that there are grounds for optimism about the future of this vehicle. 1971 SA E Transactions 710186. The Design and Operational Experience of the I'll T4x ACV in Northern Canada. A. M. Garner, Transportation Technology, Inc. The need for a utility transporter capable of amphibious operation in the varied terrain of the Arctic environment was evidenced during oil exploration activities in Alaska during the summer of 1969. Transportation Technology, Inc., undertook to design an air cushion vehicle specif- ically to meet this need, and through an accelerated program, the prototype craft completed initial trials in Texas during April-July 1970 and working trials on the Mackenzie River during September 1970. From the skirts up, the design extensively incorporates features to withstand the rigors of rough terrain, minimal maintenance facilities, and hard usage. The main frame is welded of 12 in. aluminum channels, skinned with ribbed aluminum bolt-on decking, and fitted with side extensions for ease of knockdown, air transportability, and reas- sembly at remote locations. The design is based on the selection of off-the-shelf, proved components such as standard industrial fans, light aircraft piston engines, and standard aluminum structural shapes. All controls are electrical or mechanical eliminating the need for complex hydraulic systems. 710187. The Economic Impact of Electric Vehicles. Bruce C. Netschert, National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Complete overnight electrification of all ground trans- portation in the United States is assumed in order to provide a measure of the maximum possible impact of electric vehicles. The impact on the electric utility industry would be to increase total load by roughly one-half; thus complete electrification of gouund transportation at any realistic pace would pose no serious difficulties. Similarly, the automobile manufacturing and ancillary industries, although subject to change, would find no serious difficulty in adapting. The impact on the petroleum industry, however, would be serious, for about one-half of its markets would disappear. Complete electrification of ground transportation could lead to troublesome ad- justment problems within the industry and in the regions in which it is important. An especially bothersome problem would exist in public finance. Without a transfer of the motor fuel tax funds to electricity consumed in transportation, gov- ernment revenues would be adversely affected. It is not clear, however, how the transfer could be made in a way that would be both equitable and administratively feasible. 710188. Economic Impact of Transit in the Urban Envi- ronment. Alan M. Voorhees, Alan M. Voorhees &amp; Assoc., Inc. The impact of any transit system on the urban envi- ronment is related to two areas - one, the metropolitan area; the other, along the routes near the transit stations. In the metropolitan area, the macrolevel, we find a series of social or economic impacts. Some of these can be quantified, such as savings in time and costs, but others cannot, such as facilitating decentralization, providing accessibility to employment for the disadvantaged and to educational, cultural and recreational activities, and alleviating air pollution. At the microlevel, the impact is on the development around the transit stations, due to the change in accessibility. However, this development will not be an asset to the community unless it is well done. Finally, to have a really improved urban environment, we must consider our social institutions. We must pull together our many programs into one effective program for rebuilding and managing our cities. 710190. Electric Car and Air Pollution. Paul D. Agarwal, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp.

S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The relative effect of these two types of vehicles on the environment will depend on the degree of emission controls imposed on electric powerplants. The data based on present information shows that electric cars would result in more pollutants than gasoline powered vehicles with emission controls, and hence, aggravate the air pollution problem on an area wide basis. How this picture may change in the next thirty to fifty years is also examined. 710192. Manufacture of Hot-Dipped One-Side Galvanize. A. F. Prust, Republic Steel Corp. The paper defines hot-dipped one-side galvanize and gives details of its inception and production. The material has properties similar to those of uncoated cold-rolled steel, but has inner galvanic protection. The advantages of one-side galvanize are shown to be its resistance to corrosion, its cold-rolled surface (it can be painted smoothly and easily), and its adaptability to welding. 710193. Galvanized Sheets and the Automotive Industry. F. J. Phillips, U. S. Steel Corp. A brief description is given of the manufacture of hot-dipped galvanized sheets including coating weight designations.

Inspection Lighting for the Visual Detection of Surface Flaws in Zinc Die Castings. Dennis N. Storey, Webster Mfg. (London) Ltd., Canada. This paper will attempt to point out the importance of proper lighting, its effect on the finished products, the reduction of rejects, and cost savings incurred as a result of these lighting improvements. As in most zinc die casting operating facilities, visual inspection is the essence of assuring quality standards. 710196. Improvements in Vibratory Equipment and Sup- plies for Finishing Zinc Die Castings. William E. Brandt, Wheelabrator Corp. This paper reviews the development of the new generation of high energy vibratory equipment and its application in vibratory finishing of zinc die castings. Special emphasis is placed on media and compounds used, new polishing techniques, more effective handling systems, and cost savings being effected. The primary benefit derived from dual shaft vibrating machines are faster and better processing of larger workloads in the same container space, together with 400-500% greater work efficiency at lower frequency and less horsepower. By using the proper combination of compounds, media, and machinery, zinc die castings can now be prepared for chromium plating with no need for buffing. Even castings with surface blemishes and slight defects can be satisfactorily finished in this manner. 710197. Reducing Costs for Electroplating Zinc Die Castings by Conserving Nickel. W. H. Safranek, Battelle Memorial Institute. The cost of electroplating zinc die castings can be reduced by employing microcracked or microporous chromium in place of conventional chromium; the former is more effective in improving corrosion performance while conserving nickel. Exposure data are examined and specifications for nickel and chromium content are presented. 710198. Selective Plating of Zinc Die Castings. Roger E. Maree, Zinc Institute, Inc. One of the greatest wastes in the field of plating of zinc die castings has been the need of plating the entire part and then painting. In some cases better than 90% of the plated area has been painted after plating. Selective plating is a technique for both conserving plating materials and reducing costs. Several paints and techniques have been used to "stop-off" areas that did not have to be plated. These parts were then plated in a regular plating cycle for zinc die castings. Good parts were produced in this way. This paper is a compilation of data from various sources. 710199. An Engineering Comparison of Die Cast Zinc and Injection Molded Polymers. L. S. Lazar, United States Testing Co.; and D. C. Herrschaft, International Lead Zinc Research Organization, Inc. An engineering evaluation conducted by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization, Inc. (ILZRO) has produced data which verify that die cast zinc is stronger, stiffer, and more thermally resistant than five major engineering thermoplastics ~ polycarbonate, polyacetal, nylon, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), and poly- propylene - under identical test procedures. However, since zinc is five to eight times more dense than the polymers tested (and most other unfilled polymers), the plastics industry often stresses the high strength-to-weight ratios and low cost per cubic inch of plastics as more than offsetting advantages. The question facing the design engineer, therefore, is: which material is the best choice for the particular application; that is, which will provide the required strength and stiffness at lowest cost? On the 95</page><page sequence="31">710200-710205 96 basis of the comparative tests performed in this research effort, the SAE 903 zinc die casting alloy is demonstrably the superior material on a cost-performance basis. 1971 SAE Transactions 710200. A High Speed Drivetrain Concept for Gas Turbine Powered Trucks. Myron M. Schall, Dana Corp. The availability of the gas turbine engine for the heavy duty highway tractor application will place greater emphasis on utilizing smaller and lighter drivetrain components. This paper describes the development of components for a 10,000 rpm drivetrain from the engine to the driving wheels. The performance of the vehicle has proven the technical feasibility of a high speed drivetrain concept for gas turbine powered trucks which may eventually be commercially available. 710201. The Allison HT-740T Automatic Transmission for Gas Turbine Powered Vehicles. M. E. Fisher, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The vehicle industry in general and the trucking industry in particular have found that mechanical power conver- sion of gas turbine engines for prime mover needs requires the use of an automatic transmission. Multiple gear ratios are required to keep the engine running within its most efficient operating range. Power shifting is required to prevent engine runaway during shifts and eliminate the attendant difficulty in matching of engine and trans- mission speeds for smooth shifting. The HT-740T automatic transmission was designed to provide optimum usage of gas turbine engines in trucks and buses. In this paper a description of the transmission gearing arrangement and controls is presented to show how the transmission functions and utilizes signals from the gas turbine engine. Other transmission features peculiar to gas turbine applications are also presented. In addition, the extensive development program to which this product has been subjected is described. 710202. G.K.N. - S.R.M. Automatic Transmission for Trucks, Buses and Off-Highway Vehicles. R. L. Abbott, G.K.N. Birfield Transmissions Limited. There are many sound reasons, both economic and mechanical, for using an automatic transmission if it has high efficiency. The G.K.N.-S.R.M. transmission links an epicyclic gear train with an unconventional converter blade system to change conditions of fluid flow and give a very high stall torque ratio. Hydraulic efficiencies in the converter stages are discussed and torque distribution in the system is analyzed. Use is made of existing elements to give hydraulic braking at negligible additional cost. Simple modifications to the blade system allow accurate matching of the transmission to the engine while auxiliary gearing may be provided to give a wider ratio spread if required. The transmission control system is described. Another version of the convertor with variable pitch impeller blades has been designed for use with turbine engines up to 400 hp which may, with advantage, be of single-shaft type. 710203. "Jet Air" Compressor Control System. A. H. Zoll and E. S. Harrison, Curtiss-Wright Corp. This paper describes the interrelated controls for auto- matic start sequencing, fuel scheduling, customer air delivery, and supervisory and protective systems as applied to the Curtiss-Wright CW657E "Jet Air" Com- pressor. Model CW657E is capable of delivering 15,000 scfm air at 85 psig (at 30 F and sea level pressure) and may be used in a diversity of manufacturing, processing, and industrial applications. A description of the control system and its operation in relation to compressor requirements, while furnishing air to feed distribution lines to air-assisted water atomizing nozzles for snow making, is reviewed as an example. Other models can deliver up to 30,000 scfm with modified control systems, including pressure controls. 710204. A Second Generation High Power Marine Gas Turbine. G. A. Hardgrove, General Electric Co. This paper discusses the components and systems incor- porated in the design of the LM2500 marine gas turbine. The discussion describes the novel and high performance features of this second generation marine gas turbine which include a high pressure ratio compressor, high temperature gas generator turbine, gas generator turbine cooling system, and high performance power turbine. The paper describes the materials used and the features incorporated which enable the LM2500 to operate successfully in a marine environment. The LM2500 marine gas turbine derived from the General Electric TF39/CF6 turbofan engine family incorporates many engineering advances which are not available in the first generation marine gas turbines. These advanced features enable the LM2500 marine gas turbine to achieve performance levels unmatched by any first generation marine gas turbines now in service. Because of its lower air flow, smaller size, and integrated components and systems, the LM2500 marine gas turbine offers the Ship Designer and Naval Architect excellent installation characteristics and improved reliability and maintenance characteristics. 710205.

Basic hydraulic diagrams and the lubrication circuit</page><page sequence="32">710206-710211 analysis are described with working equations. The computer program with sample results is illustrated, and the calculations are compared with actual dynamometer test results. This analytical method can be used to determine the adequacy of oil pump capacity, and to evaluate bearing design and oil path circuitry. 710206. Analysis and Experiments on Carburetor Meter- ing at the Transition Region to the Main System. Kazuo Shinoda, Hiroshi Koide and Akira Yii, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. A series of analyses and experiments has been carried out on the problem of poor air/fuel ratio characteristics at the transition region from the idle system to the main system. The fuel supply characteristic of the idle system, as well as that of the main system, has been treated as a function of intake airflow rate. It has been shown theoretically that the behavior of fuel in the transition region results from the fuel passage construction of the conventional type of carburetor, and that a uniform air/fuel ratio can never be supplied in the transition region without a main air-bleed system. The effects of the main air-bleed system on fuel supply characteristics at the transition region have been inves- tigated quantitatively. The mechanism of fuel supply at the transition region has been confirmed through exper- iments made on actual parts. 1971 SA E Transactions 710207. The Influence of Fuel Properties on Metering in Carburetors. J. A. Bolt, S. J. Derezinski and D. L. Harrington, The University of Michigan. This paper considers the influence of the properties of gasolines and testing fluids on metering by carburetors. Since the fuel metering is controlled by orifices, the effects of fuel properties on orifice flow are analyzed. The results of an orifice testing program are presented, using the Reynolds number as the primary correlation parameter. The influences of fuel type, fuel temperature, and orifice geometry on the discharge coefficient are discussed, and the effect of a given fuel property change is shown. Experimental values for the variations in fluid prop- erties with fuel type and temperature are presented for commercial gasolines, carburetor testing fluids, and pure hydrocarbons. The variation of carbon-to-hydrogen ratio among gasolines is shown to cause a change in stoichi- ometry, which is the equivalent of an error in metering. Experimental results which show the effect of fuel temperature on metering by a carburetor are evaluated in terms of fundamental fluid processes, and the basic factors to be considered in designing fuel-channels with inherent compensation for fuel-property changes are discussed.

Beard and G. J. Smith, Associated Engrg. Developments Ltd., England. Several basic heat transfer equations have been utilized to enable the calculation of the thermal performances of vehicle radiator cores. The application of the calculation procedure to the two types of radiator matrix in general use has been shown in some detail, and results using these methods have been compared with experimental values. These correlations have shown that the calculation procedure can be used with confidence to predict matrix dissipations for Reynolds numbers in the water tubes of less than 1000 as found in automobile heater cores, as well as for the larger Reynolds numbers in the water tubes typical of automobile radiator cores. 710209. Computer Program for Engine Cooling Radiator Selection. Charles N. Kurland, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. A computer program for selecting a radiator to provide a desired level of engine cooling, and for predicting the engine cooling performance with this radiator, has been formulated. The program is based upon the relationship of laboratory heat rejections to the in-car heat rejection of a baseline engine. Described are the methods of obtaining the engine heat rejection and the application of this information to the computer program. Comments concerning the benefits as well as the limitations of using this technique are included. 710210. Hydraulic Fail-Safe Emergency and Parking Brake System. J. J. Borbi, Rockwell-Standard Co. The Stopmaster brake, which provides a parking and emergency braking system, is described. The operation of both air and hydraulic actuated brakes is discussed, with special emphasis on the feature* of the hydraulic system, and the operation and performance of the emergency braking system. 710211. "Triple-Safe" Air Brake System: Service, Emer- gency, Parking. E. F. Beatty, Anchorlok Div., Royal Industries. The term triple-safe is used to identify an air brake system with three separate circuits, two of which are service brake systems of virtually equal effectiveness; the third is a spring parking brake system. The paper reviews the spring parking brake chamber capability and describes a triple-safe air brake system and chambers that have similar service and emergency capacities, and parking capabilities, to meet future requirements of trucks and buses. 97</page><page sequence="33">710212-710219 98 710212. The Influence of Wind Tunnel Tests on Body Design, Ventilation, and Surface Deposits of Sedans and Sport Cars. Hans Goetz, Daimler- Benz AG. This paper describes wind tunnel tests with full-scale vehicles and scaled-down models. The influence of design features, air resistance, and lift on driving performance and safety are analyzed. Ventilation systems and air pressure conditions are discussed as well as the precau- tions taken to reduce surface deposits. The various operating modes of the new wind tunnel developed for Daimler-Benz AG are also described. 1971 SA E Transactions 710213. The Aerodynamics of Race Cars in Drafting and Passing Situations. G. F. Romberg, F. Chianese, Jr. and R. G. Lajoie, Chrysler Corp. The aerodynamic forces on NASCAR National Race Cars in "drafting" and passing situations are defined, utilizing steady-state wind tunnel test results. The phe- nomena occurring in these situations are discussed in relation to their effects on handling maneuvers and improved performance. Graphic presentation of data obtained for lift, drag, and yaw supplement the discussion. 710214. General Layout Characteristics and Performance of a New Wind Tunnel for Aerodynamic and Functional Tests on Full-Scale Vehicles. Alberto Morelli, Istituto della Motorizzazione Poli- tecnico di Torino. This paper discusses the advantages of closed type and open type working sections of a wind tunnel designed for aerodynamic tests on full-size vehicles. Analyses of economic considerations, component efficiency, and applicability to the specific purpose of testing were the deciding factors in choosing the open type working section for this wind tunnel being erected by Pininfarina at Torino, Italy. Preliminary design work and supporting research are described. 710215. High Speed Dynamometers - Modern Water Brakes Offer New Potential for Testing Engines. Joachim C. Bronder and Charles S. Jewett, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. New developments make water brakes suitable for an unlimited number of dynamometer applications. Per- formance, operation, and mechanical design of the multiple, perforated disc water brake is described. Prin- ciples of power absorption are discussed and various power absorption devices are compared. Knowledge gained through 300,000 hr of testing gas turbine engines with water brakes makes it possible to produce compact, lightweight, dependable, low-cost water brakes. The deleterious effect of cavitation has been avoided. A water brake with a weight-to-absorbed power ratio of 0.025 lb/hp was developed. 710216. Direct Drive Viscous Shear Water Dynamome- ters for Large Gas Turbines. Leon R. Wosika, Solar Div., International Harvester Co. After several years of negative experience using conven- tional commercial water dynamometers directly driven at free power turbine speed, the author's company undertook an in-house design of a noncavitating dynamometer having the objectives of long life and low maintenance cost. This paper is a review of the design and performance of the dynamometer utilizing smooth disk and stator elements and employing viscous shear variable immersion torque control. 710217. Hydrodynamic Consideration in Water Dyna- mometer Design. Donald D. Knudsen and Richard B. Countess, Avco Corp. This paper presents an analysis of the hydrodynamic considerations in the design of water dynamometers, with particular emphasis on high-speed dynamometers with high rotor tip velocities. Hydrodynamic tradeoff consid- erations for high rotor tip speeds are discussed. Quantitive design techniques are presented to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics in water dynamometers. These techniques are strictly empirical and limited in view of design requirements. Recent demands for higher speed, higher power density, long service life dynamometers have introduced added hydrodynamic tradeoff problems which require further investigation. This paper clearly portrays the need for a research water dynamometer program to provide data necessary to advance water dynamometer design technology. A re- search and development program currently under way is discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710218. Cooperative Evaluation of Techniques for Meas- uring Hydrocarbons in Diesel Exhaust (A CRC Report). T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co.; and J. H. Johnson, Michigan Tech. Univ. Methods available for measuring hydrocarbons in diesel exhaust were evaluated by the CRC-APRAC Program Group on Diesel Exhaust Composition during 1967-1970. Early tests showed distressingly large variations from instrument to instrument and undesirably large variations among repeated measurements by one instrument. In- strument quality and operator competence were better in later tests, agreement among instruments was relatively good, and errors within instruments were small. Current techniques appear acceptable for engineering measure- ments. No further cooperative work is planned by CRC at present, but techniques for measuring hydrocarbons in diesel exhaust will be reappraised periodically. 710219. The Effect of Exhaust System Geometry on Exhaust Dilution and Odor Intensity. J. M. Colucci and G. J. Barnes, General Motors Corp. Diesel exhaust gas dilution and odor intensity were measured in the immediate vicinity of a transit bus</page><page sequence="34">710220-710224 equipped with: a rear-mounted, horizontal exhaust pipe; a rear-mounted, vertical exhaust pipe; and a roof-top diffusion system. Exhaust dilution ratios were measured indoors during vehicle idle operation, using propane added to the exhaust gas as a tracer. Exhaust odor intensities were measured also indoors during vehicle idle operation by a human panel, using a threshold odor measurement technique. On the average, the dilution of the exhaust gas around the bus with the vertical exhaust pipe was about eight times greater than it was with the horizontal pipe. Odor intensity, as measured by the threshold response distance, was about 35%. less with the vertical pipe than with the horizontal pipe. The roof-top diffuser was not as effective as the vertical exhaust pipe in increasing exhaust gas dilution or in reducing exhaust odor intensity. These results indicate that the exhaust system geom- etry may have a considerable effect on exhaust odor intensity of diesel-powered vehicles. 710220. Combustion and Emission Formation in Fuel Sprays Injected in Swirling Air. N. A. Henein, Wayne State University. The purpose of this paper is to develop some concepts for the mechanisms of emission formation during the com- bustion of liquid fuel sprays injected in swirling air. An emphasis is made on finely dispersed sprays used in open chamber diesel engines. The emissions studied are the unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, aldehydes, smoke particulates, and oxides of nitrogen. The spray is considered to be composed of a group of droplets of different sizes. The behavior of these droplets is determined by studying a mathematical model for droplet evaporation and ignition. The spray is then divided into regions, depending on the mechanism of combustion in each region. The emissions formed in each region are examined. The concepts developed for the formation of the different emissions in the spray are used for a qualitative analysis of some engine experimental data. These data are for the effect of the operating variables on the emission concentration in the exhaust of open chamber diesel engines. In these engines the fuel is injected in swirling air. 710221. A Mathematical Model for the Mass Transfer and Combustible Mixture Formation Around Fuel Droplets. N. A. Henein, Wayne State University. The vapor diffusion and the combustible mixture for- mation around evaporating fuel droplets are studied. The formulas derived for the droplet temperature, and vapor concentration profiles take into consideration the un- steady period before the droplet reaches its equilibrium temperature. In this model the droplet is assumed to be suddenly brought into contact with a high temperature oxidizing atmosphere. The ignition delay is considered equal to the period of time from the start of heating up to the time for formation of a stoichiometric mixture at the ignition location around the droplet. Computations are made for the temperature history, concentration history, and the ignition delay for iso- octane droplets evaporating in air. The droplet sizes considered are between 1 120 and 1520 /a. The air pressure is 14.7 psia, and the air temperatures are 1095-1390 F. The comparison between the results of the present model and previous experimental results showed favorable agree- ment. 710222. Truck Suspension System Optimization. Bruce D. Van Deusen, Chrysler Corp. This paper describes a test program and computer simulation aimed at optimizing the riding qualities of a military tractor-semitrailer combination, the Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET). Instrumented testing at the U. S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground was conducted with a variety of suspension configurations. The test data were recorded on magnetic tape and converted into digital data for computer processing. The test results were correlated with computer simulation. The computer model was then used to perform a sensitivity analysis of various suspension parameters. With rms acceleration at the vehicle frame used as a criterion for optimization, an improved suspension configuration was defined. The techniques for test data analysis and computer simulation are described, and preliminary results are presented. 1971 SAE Transactions 710223. The Dynamic Performance of Articulated High- way Vehicles - A Review of the State-of-the-Art. Howard Dugoff and R. W. Murphy, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. This paper reviews the state of theoretical and experi- mental technology relative to the dynamic performance of articulated highway vehicles. The review contains three major sections, corresponding to the traditional break- down of vehicle performance: directional performance, braking performance, and combined directional and braking performance. An attempt is made to take a frankly evaluative point of view and to point out knowledge gaps and unanswered questions, in addition to documenting previous accomplishments and progress. The paper concludes with some recommendations for future research consistent with the findings of the review. 1971 SAE Transactions 710224. Effect of Vibrations on the Performance of Off-Road Vehicles. Jo-Yung Wong, Carleton University. The existing method for predicting the tractive per- formance of off-road vehicles is based on the meas- urements of terrain parameters made under static con- ditions, and neglects any dynamic effects on vehicle- terrain interaction. It has been shown, however, that in off-road locomotion the unevenness of terrain surface 99</page><page sequence="35">710225-710233 100 often produces considerable vehicle vibrations and dy- namic load on vehicle running gear. In order to improve the prediction of vehicle performance, it is of importance to investigate the effect of vibrations on vehicle-terrain interaction. This paper first describes an experimental study on the effect of vertical vibrations on shearing characteristics between vehicle running gear and terrain under simulated operating conditions. It is found that the amplitude of dynamic load and slip velocity have profound effect on the horizontal shearing force developed on vehicular ground contact areas. In general, the higher the amplitude of dynamic load and the lower the slip velocity, the less the horizontal shearing force will be developed. The second part of the paper is devoted to the examination of the relationship between vehicle vibrations and surface irregularity. By integrating the results of the study on vehicle vibrations excited by surface roughness with the experimental results concerning the effect of vibrations on vehicle-terrain interaction, a general frame- work correlating vehicle vibrations and vehicle per- formance with terrain conditions is established. It is hoped that this study will provide guiding principles for more rational prediction and evaluation of off-road vehicle performance. 710225. Hybrid Computer Simulation of the Dynamic Response of a Vehicle with Four-Wheel Adaptive Brakes. G. B. Hickner, J. G. Elliott and G. A. Cornell, The Bendix Corp. An improved version of the 17-degree-of-freedom hybrid computer simulation is being modified to include a 4-wheel adaptive braking system (ABS). The derivation and verification of the ABS model, the form of the integrated vehicle/ABS model, and future plans for validation and utilization of the integrated hybrid simu- lation are presented. 710227. Linear Suspension System Parameter Identifi- cation. Glenn A. Jackson and James W. Grant, U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. A method for measuring spring rate and damping coefficient is necessary for complete laboratory evaluation of a suspension component. This report outlines a technique by which a linear model is adjusted by an analog computer so that its parameters match those of the test specimen. The accuracy of this linear model is good unless the test specimen parameters are very nonlinear. To determine how structural changes in a suspension unit affect the dynamic action of the unit, measurable suspension parameters must be defined. One set of parameters can be obtained by assuming that, for small angular motion, a single suspension unit can be modelled by a parallel springer-damper combination. This system is completely defined by the two parameters spring rate, K, and damping coefficient, D. This paper outlines a method to measure K and D under laboratory conditions which simulate typical operational environment. 710230. The Wheel Pump Propulsion System for Floating Vehicles. I. R.

A novel design in which the wheel of a military vehicle is modified into an axial flow pump in order to provide improved forward propulsion is presented along with full scale experimental data and concept evaluation. 710231. A New Approach to Positive Drive Snowmobile Tracks. William M. Haines, Gates Rubber Co. The involute lug drive snowmobile track is a major step forward in the technological improvement of snowmobile performance. New materials, new designs, and new methods are employed to fabricate a snowmobile track that has outstanding performance characteristics. The liquid cast polyurethane system makes possible improved track carcass construction, maintaining the ultimate physical properties required to make a long lived, efficient, power transmitting snowmobile track. This article discusses the engineering principles of snowmobile locomotion and how they apply to the improved design of the involute lug drive track. The relation between material, physical properties, construc- tion methods, design, and track performance is developed. Fatigue characteristics of textile tensile cords are pre- sented showing correlation to field and laboratory track testing. The exceptional polyurethane involute lug track and drive wheel characteristics are compared with conventional tracks. Problems associated with snow- mobile track field testing and evaluation are discussed. The engine hp loss due to less oxygen available at higher elevations is graphically compared to SAE elevation correction factors. The peculiarities of Alpine snow conditions are presented as the ultimate proving grounds for snowmobiles. 710232. The Riverine Utility Craft (RUC). W. K. Fales, Chrysler Corp., D. W. Amick, U.S. Navy Naval Ship Systems Command; and B. G. Schreiner, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Navy's need for a craft to negotiate riverine areas led to the development of the Riverine Utility Craft (RUC). The RUC is supported and propelled by two counter- rotating screws, and can be classified as a "zero draft" craft. The prototype RUC has proved to be highly mobile in shallow water, mud, and marshy terrains and is capable of carrying 2000 lb of cargo or seven personnel. 710233. Principles of Stepping Vehicles with Overbridging and Self-Leveling Properties. L. Gerstel, Tech- nion, Israel. The underlying concept of this paper is "motion by alternately interchanging length of a body", effected by mechanical means - vertically stepping (tachimetrical) bike and pneumatic means. Concerning the pneumatic moving structure, the</page><page sequence="36">710234-710238 construction as well as the guiding of its direction is effected by differential tensions in the tension strings. The generating conception is that of a structure that translates its "own bridge" forward (thus producing an expanded length of it) and slides on it, (while remaining in a state of static equilibrium). The pneumatic structure is extracting its own bridge (like a tensegrity worm) and is contracting itself forward. Thus vehicles may overclimb and undercrawl others of the same size, like ants. This feature is thought to eliminate the hopeless problem of traffic crossings. As is shown in the course of the study, the author thinks that though the wheel is one of the most important inventions of mankind, nevertheless it is the very wheel which is responsible for the segregation of movement (horizontal and vertical). 710234. Dual Battery Electric Powerplant. Earl H. Hietbrink, Gary L. Winebrener and Romeo R. Witherspoon, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. As part of a continuous program to develop and evaluate advanced battery concepts for vehicle propulsion, General Motors has built and operated a dual battery test vehicle, the XEP, to explore the potential and problems of a mechanically rechargeable zinc-air energy battery. The zinc-air battery is economically attractive and has suffi- cient power density to have potential as a power source for low performance vehicles and to be used as an energy battery augmented by a power battery as a dual battery power source for higher performance vehicular appli- cations. Although the XEP vehicle was operated successfully, it was concluded that a mechanically rechargeable zinc-air battery was not practical. The encouraging performance and attractive economic features of the zinc-air battery provide the justification for continuous research and development efforts to evolve an electrically rechargeable battery that could have considerable potential as a practical power source for specific vehicular applications. 1971 SAE Transactions 710235.

The design of a transmission for heat engine-battery hybrid vehicles, the electromechanical transmission, (EMT) is described. Results of the testing of a breadboard EMT power train on a dynamometer are discussed in terms of emission reduction, fuel consumption, and power flow efficiencies. Sources of system inefficiency and areas of further investigation are identified. Discussion: W. H. Koch, Ford Motor Co.; Authors' closure 1971 SAE Transactions 710236. Hybrid Battery System. D. H. Brown, General Electric Co. Electric vehicles that mix with normal traffic must provide bursts of high torque as they accelerate from standstill to operating speed. Battery systems that are sized for sustained driving experience excessive drain during each acceleration from rest. A system providing a separate small battery for acceleration and the means to isolate the main battery from brief peak current demands is pre- sented in this paper along with the benefits in weight, cost, and range that result. Operation of the General Electric Delta research vehicle with and without the dual battery system demonstrated the distinct advantages of the hybrid battery system. 710237. A New Zinc-Air Fuel Battery System. Hideo Baba, Sony Corp. Research Center. The new zinc-air fuel battery system described here uses pulverized zinc as its fuel. The pulverized zinc fuel is suspended in an aqueous KOH electrolyte, which serves as the carrier of the fuel, and is sequentially fed into each cell of the battery stack intermittently. The method of feeding fuel to each cell is fully detailed. The used fuel and the electrolyte of this new battery system can be removed from the battery and regenerated externally by an electrolytic process without any loss of zinc or electrolyte. Details of the construction and performance of two prototypes of this fuel battery system are presented. The energy density of these two prototypes was 32 Whr/lb and 42 Whr/lb, in the case of 5 hr and 10 hr operation, respectively. 1971 SAE Transactions 710238. Power Requirements of Electric Vehicles. G. F. Herbert and A. E. Anderson, Mechanical Re- search Dept., Ford Motor Co. An analytical investigation has provided a new and useful procedure for evaluating the peak power requirements of a vehicle, based upon the desired levels of accelerative performance and the vehicle usage, that is, city, suburban, or highway applications. These power requirements have been used to determine the required weight of the vehicle power source, based upon its effective power density and the propulsion system efficiency. A computer solution to the one-dimensional equation of motion of a vehicle with a non-linear input was used to predict vehicle performance. Consideration has been given to various combinations of constant power-torque limited drives to determine the relationship between the torque-speed characteristics of the energy source and the vehicle performance. This information was used to find the locus of power which the energy source must deliver (as a function of vehicle speed) to provide the desired vehicle performance within specified limits. To illustrate potential applications of this method, examples of a battery-electric drive and a hybrid (engine- battery) drive system were considered for a compact-size car with performance equivalent to today's compacts. Three types of batteries were used to demonstrate that the vehicle performance is severely degraded as the battery 101</page><page sequence="37">710239-710246 102 becomes discharged. Battery discharge derating factors, which were developed to characterize this behavior, can be applied to the rated power densities to determine the effective power density of a given battery at any predetermined maximum depth of discharge. It was found that the battery weight penalty was high when a vehicle was designed to provide minimum acceptable perform- ance at a preselected state of battery discharge.

A discussion of microfilm its use in storage and retrieval systems, and its combining with computers show the applications which can help the engineer do his job. 710243. Solution of Automotive Structural Problems Using the Finite Element Method and Computer Graphics. J. J. Hessel and S. J. Lammers, Ford Motor Co. One of the many computer oriented structural programs which utilize the finite element technique is briefly discussed. Examples are presented to demonstrate the application of this program to actual product engineering structural problems. Correlation between predicted de- flections and stresses and those obtained in the laboratory are presented. Computer graphics provide a unique method of visually interrogating input data and displaying output data. Graphs, stress contours, and deflected structures obtained by this method are presented. 1971 SA E Transactions 710244. DAMN Digital Computer Program for the Dy- namic Analysis of Generalized Mechanical Sys- tem. Milton A. Chace and Donald A. Smith, The University of Michigan. Effective computer-aided design of engineering systems requires comprehensive computer-application software that conveniently adapts to the particular engineering design considered. This paper discusses the theoretical background and initial experience with a program intend- ed for computer-aided design of machine-like mechanical systems, and outlines the use of a time-shared graphic terminal for schematic display of program output. The program is applicable to three types of mechanical systems: linear and nonlinear unconstrained dynamic systems, kinematic systems (that is, constrained systems), and multifreedom, constrained systems. 1971 SA E Transactions 710245. Systematic Approach to Integrated Design. James E. Showalter and David V. Sears, Detroit Diesel/Allison Div., General Motors Corp. This work presents an application-oriented use of the man-machine interactive system concept. The paper specifically addresses itself to a description of a procedure developed by Allison Div. of General Motors to effec- tively perform the preliminary design of a gas turbine engine. The tools used in this approach are a set of complex programs written for design and analysis of engine components, an integrating system used for interprogram communication to guarantee data compat- ibility, and a graphic display terminal to allow on-line action and reaction. With these tools the heuristic problem of preliminary design can be solved in units of time that can be orders of magnitude less than previous more conventional efforts. Also discussed is the logical exten- sion of this type of approach into areas other than preliminary design. 710246. Transmission Transients Produced in Range Shifting-A Digital Computer Simulation. K. A. Dornfeld, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The development of a new automatic power shifting transmission often involves many hours of prototype testing to optimize such vital factors as gear arrangement, clutch design, and rate of clutch pressure application. However, prediction of expected test results through the use of mathematical models can greatly reduce the time and cost required for that optimization. A generalized computer program was written to predict transient speeds and torques, clutch energy absorption, and vehicle dynamics during range shifts. The program utilizes a time-increment method of simulation. The error produced in the time-increment method and the means of circumventing this error are significant points of interest covered in this paper. This program has been used successfully to study shift phenomena in existing transmissions and to aid in evaluation of new transmission gear arrangements. Similar programs are suggested for other simulation work where non-linear discontinuous functions need to be studied.</page><page sequence="38">710247-710253 710247. Influence of Rotor Metallurgy on the Wear of Friction Materials in Automotive Brakes. S. K. Rhee, The Bendix Corp. A drag dynamometer was used to investigate the influence of rotor properties on the wear of automotive brake linings. The effects on lining wear of temperature, surface roughness, thermal conductivity, microstructure and composition were studied quantitatively, and the mech- anisms governing lining wear were elucidated. Lining wear at high temperatures increases exponentially with increas- ing temperature, and decreases exponentially with in- creasing thermal conductivity of the rotor. The wear increases parabolically with increasing surface roughness of the rotor. Also, coupling of a lining with a rotor having compatible composition and microstructure is very im- portant for controlling the lining wear. 1971 SAE Transactions 710248. The Chrysler "Sure-Brake" - The First Produc- tion Four-Wheel Anti-Skid System. J. W. Doug- las, Chrysler Corp.; and T. C. Schafer, Bendix Corp. The paper outlines testing, development, and operation of the first production four-wheel slip control system for passenger cars in the United States. The Chrysler Corporation calls the system "Sure-Brake," but it is more generally known as "anti-skid." The first portion of the paper deals with consider- ations that led Chrysler into the "Sure-Brake" system, the philosophy behind the system and a detailed explanation of its operation. The second portion deals with the development and testing leading to the release as an option on the 1971 Imperial. The testing program introduced a new dimension to brake engineering. Before the advent of wheel slip control systems, many thousands of brake tests were conducted but were always terminated at the point of skid. These tests were also conducted mainly on black top or concrete roads. For the first time, thousands of stops were made at maximum deceleration on every available surface. The paper lists the results obtained and attempts to pass on some of the lessons learned in handling skidding vehicles. 1971 SAE Transactions 710249. Machine Testing for Brake Lining Classification. A. J. Wilson and G. T. Bowsher, Girling Ltd., England. Methods of testing brake linings by sample machine have been evolved to a standard of consistency which enables the performance of a brake to be evaluated by consid- eration of the geometry of the system and the coefficient of friction of the lining. This situation does, however, only hold if the way in which the lining is tested bears a close relationship to the duty cycle employed on an actual brake. In this paper the correlation between brake per- formance and estimates based on scale testing shows that a classification can be employed to simplify the choice of replacement linings when a single material is employed. Duo servo brakes, are least amenable to this technique because of their high sensitivity. 1971 SAE Transactions 710250. Correlation of Vehicle, Dynamometer and Other Laboratory Tests for Brake Friction Materials. J. D. Preston and R. J. Forthofer, National Bureau of Standards. The frictional properties of brake lining materials are greatly influenced by the manner in which they are used. Test procedures designed to measure the coefficient of friction of these materials can likewise produce widely differing results depending on the type of test conducted. This paper presents data illustrating the performance correlation of three commercially available brake lining materials when subjected to vehicle tests and some of the more commonly used laboratory test procedures. 710251. Trends in Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids and Their Standards. J. L. Harvey, L. T. Milliken and R. J. Forthofer, National Bureau of Standards. The devepment of motor vehicle brake fluids (MVBFs) and of their specification requirements is reviewed and discussed with emphasis on the major problems encoun- tered in service. Those factors held to be of major importance in establishing performance requirements for MVBFs are considered also, and applied to the major changes that have recently been proposed for revision of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 1 16. The need and possibilities for further revisions in the MVBF safety standard are examined. Finally, potential effects of some current trends in the design of passenger car braking systems are considered. Discussion: R. W.

This paper will try to give an overall view of the very complex brake fluid situation existing in Europe today. It is written with the hope to create a better understanding for the actual, realistic requirements that have to be set for modern and safe brake fluids. It is further hoped that it may help to pave the way for an international stan- dardization of brake fluid specifications and test methods. 710253. Operating Performance of Motor Vehicle Brak- ing Systems as Affected by Fluid Water Content. R. W. Radliński, R. J. Forthofer and J. L. Harvey, National Bureau of Standards. Automotive hydraulic brake fluids are known to pick up water in service. This paper shows that a major portion of the water picked up by the brake fluid in a braking system is transmitted through the hoses. It discusses two major effects of water pick-up on brake fluid performance- 103</page><page sequence="39">710254-710262 104 reduction in vapor lock temperature and increase in low temperature viscosity.

Harkrishan Singh, Body Engineering Office, Ford Motor Co. The Kinematic Analysis Methods Computer Program that has been used by Ford Motor Co. to evaluate mechanisms for the past four years has been modified to generate performance curves for windshield wiper linkages directly using a Calcomp Plotter. Problems such as stalling, "jerky" operation, and excessive phase lag between wipers can be detected early in the design stages by careful evaluation of the curves. 710255. Windshield Wiper System Design. Dale M. Cunningham, Engineering Office, Chrysler Corp. The passenger car windshield wiper system design is very dependent upon the vehicle styling. As such, wiper systems are continually being revised or redesigned to accommodate new styling themes and incorporate engi- neering improvements. The design process is discussed from the initial feasibility phase to the final production release of detailed drawings. Since the application of computers to wiper design has been covered in other articles, the classical approach with little computer usage is emphasized. The various possible system configurations are reviewed in addition to a general discussion of the wipe pattern design, the linkage design, and the consid- erations for recessed or concealed wiper parking. 710256. Windshield Wiper System Product Development and Testing. Paul D. Arbogast, Chrysler Corp. This paper presents an overview of the windshield wiper system development and testing required to achieve desired performance levels. Specific tests for the system and individual components are discussed, along with methods for coordinating the various development phases and the interaction with groups outside the engineering field. 710257. Windshield Wiper System Motor Selection and Application. Donald H. Baumhart and Joseph J. Augustine, Ford Motor Co. The selection of a motor for a windshield wiper system requires a full analysis of all system variables, in addition to strict adherence to tests and development procedures. Following a well-programmed procedure will assure complete and adequate windshield wiper prime mover selection and successful application. There are five basic steps discussed: 1. Determination of wiper parameters, 2. Motor performance. 3. System load determination. 4. Calibration and matching of wiper motor to system. 5. Testing and evaluating. 710258. The Future of Hydraulic-Powered Wiper Motors. Richard A. Batt, Trico Products Corp. The hydraulic-powered wiper motor has been providing all-weather vision with full selectivity of wiping frequency on production model automobiles since 1961. This paper outlines the features of the hydraulic- powered wiper motor, examines hydraulic power sources, reviews the design and operation of the current produc- tion wiper motor, and presents performance and endur- ance test data. It describes the development of a simpler, more economical, smaller design motor with equivalent performance and endurance and with provisions for quick connection of hydraulic lines. Future applications for hydraulic-powered wiper motors are suggested. 710260. Electronic Wiper Timing Devices. Helmut G. Seidler, Philco-Ford Corp. Under certain conditions, such as light rain, heavy fog, or back spray from other vehicles on wet roads, windshield wipers may cause smearing of the windshield. This is due to a wet/dry condition of the windshield where insuf- ficient moisture is available for continuous wiping. To overcome this, it is desirable to provide intermittent operation where the wiper blade dwells for an interval time before starting the next cycle. This dwell period may be accomplished by electrical or mechanical means. This paper discusses the various approaches, with special emphasis on the electronic wiper timing devices. 710261. On Fatigue Testing of Passenger Car Body Construction. Keiji Kobayashi, Keiji Yama- guchi and Takayuki Ikejiri, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Fatigue tests on a body in white have been made with torsional load and compared with previous results for assessments, where it was difficult to agree with proving ground tests in evaluating the life. Modifying the above mentioned fault, a programmed fatigue test method on the body in white is presented in this paper. The newly developed programmed fatigue test method is the simultaneous loading of the bouncing and torsional modes to a body in white by an electrohydraulic fatigue testing machine in accordance with the programmed sprung mass accelerations. Applying this method, the comparatively accurate assessment of proving ground test was made at the condition of the body in white, and the development period for body construction was shortened. 710262. Plastic Models for Dynamic Structural Analysis. W. A. Elliott, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp. Scaled plastic models can be used to predict the dynamic response of complex structures, particularly critical</page><page sequence="40">710263-710273 frequencies and mode shapes. The basic advantage in model design analysis is the flexibility in altering initial concepts at early stages of design which can be accom- plished quickly, simply and at lower costs than would probably be encountered if the structure was fabricated in the prototype material. This paper presents the use of plastic models as a design tool for stamped, welded steel automotive structures and subsequent engineering tests. 1971 SA E Transactions 710263. Application of Finite Element Method to Predict Static Response of Automotive Body Structures. Willy Petersen, Ford Motor Co. Applications of the finite element method for analysis of partial and complete body structures are described. Ford Motor Co.'s version of the Structural Analysis and Matrix Interpretive System (SAMIS) computer program provides the capability for a static analysis of structures with over 10,000 degrees of freedom. Special modeling techniques for spot welded structural components have been inves- tigated. Also, methods for quick input data development and effective visual displays of output data are discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710266. Outdoor Aging of Adhesive Sealants. N. J. DeLollis and O. Montoya, Sandia Labs. Aging of adhesive sealants such as polysulfides and silicones is usually restricted to accelerated aging in ovens and other laboratory environments. A need for extended aging under actual outdoor conditions has long existed. This report described the results of five-year aging tests on five different types of polysulfide and silicone adhesive sealants under various environments, including semiarid and marine-type outdoor aging sites. These are compared with oven aging and ambient shelf aging results. Data on continuous exposure for 12 months to high humidity with cycling temperature are also included. The results indicate that a marine climate is the worst exposure condition. The results also show that a manganese peroxide cured polysulfide is more sensitive to a marine climate than is a lead peroxide cured polysulfide. 710269. Gas Turbine Powered1 Trucks on the Job. Nor- man B. Chew, Freightliner Corp. Since its first truck in 1965, Freightliner has run its turbine truck on the highways hauling revenue freight and testing different power train configurations and learning about the application of the turbine engine to a truck chassis. During this test period the engine was run at 300 and 360 horsepower. Two drive train configurations were tested, a specially adapted Allison MT42 transmission and a high-speed transmission drive train operating at 10,000 rpm developed by Dana for this test truck. It was determined that the chassis weight for the turbine engine installed can be reduced well in excess of 2,000 pounds when all drive components are optimized. These tests have shown that significant gains can be made in maintenance costs and tire wear with the use of the turbine engine, besides providing reliability. Fuel figures for the simple turbine show that the need for the regenerator to improve the overall fuel efficiency and, further, the need for variable geometry or power transfer to improve the part throttle operation. The turbine engine will probably find its first home in the long haul operations where weight savings and reliability will come into play. To gain its place in the reliability figures, the accessory items with the turbine must also perform well with all the other control switches on the turbine. The electrical system still proved to be the most troublesome on the vehicle. 710270. The Role of the Product Planner. B. H. Bouw- kamp, Chrysler Corp. The product planner's role is to help his company develop and sell the best possible product at the lowest possible price, while making a suitable profit. The main objective is to give the customer what he wants, deciding what this is, and, utilizing the resources of the company, to help management to arrive at the decisions necessary to produce the desired product. The product planner's qualifications, duties, methods, and responsibilities are discussed in terms of automobile planning. 710271. The Engineer in the 1970s - Finding an Effective Voice. Donovan L. Robinson, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The decade of the 1970's is a crucial one for engineers. Our environment is being fouled - as is the engineer's image when he is singled out as the creator of the sources of pollution. The engineer is now being held responsible to his community, as well as to his profession. The temp- tation to involve his professional organization in problems which have social and political overtones will surely foster serious disagreement within that organization. He should, instead, involve himself in local politics, where he can develop an audience for his opinions and where he can influence those in power to implement original and effective solutions to environmental problems. 7Í6272. Vehicle Air Pollution - The Problem and Its Solution. William P. Lear and Kenneth L. Nail, Lear Motors Corp. The control of ever-increasing air pollution has become one of the most urgent problems of today. Man, through some of his machines, has created an astonishing health problem: he is increasingly fouling his most preeious commodity, the air he breathes. Even though machines have been put to shocking and tragic use, man's greatest and proudest triumphs have been produced through the machine. Harnessed power greatly extends the productivity of man and has become necessary to his very existence. Our density is unalterably bound to the machine. We must learn to live with it. 710273.

The behavior of stainless clad aluminum automotive trim has been investigated, using modern electrochemical techniques in laboratory and field-service tests. Galvanic protection of paint-damaged auto body and the cor- responding sacrificial aluminum behavior with this trim material has been observed in a wide number of appli- cations and conditions. The results obtained with stainless clad aluminum automotive trims are compared with those for other trim materials. The results are explained using modern electrochemical theories. 710277. Impact Fatigue Resistance of Commonly Used Gear Steels. R. A. DePaul, The International Nickel Co., Inc. Gears fail or are damaged on occasion by impact fatigue loading. This study involves an evaluation of the resis- tance of commonly used gear steels to impact fatigue failure. A specially designed impact fatigue specimen and testing device were used to evaluate nine carburizing steels (SAE 4118, 4620, 4626, 4718, 4817, 8620, 8822, EX-1, and the European 16MnCr5) and three nitriding steels (Nitralloy G, Nitralloy N, and 5NÌ-2A1). The relative impact fatigue resistances of the steels are discussed as well as the influences of such heat treatment variables as high carbon potential, high temperature carburizing, and refrigeration. In general, impact fatigue resistance was independent of core strength but improved with increas- ing nickel content in the nitrided steels as well as the carburized steels. Lowering retained austenite by refrig- eration was found to be detrimental to impact fatigue resistance. 710278. Metallurgical Instability and Residual Stresses in Hardened Steel. E. B. Evans, Florida State University. All hardened steels in the as-quenched condition are metallurgically unstable, i.e., the amounts and composi- tions of the various phases present can be changed by thermal, mechanical, and environmental means. Six factors-cold treatment, tempering, aging, austenite rever- sion, environment (radiation), plastic deformation-are reviewed as to their influence on the metallurgical instability of hardened steel as revealed by changes in macro residual stresses and retained austenite content. 710279. X-Ray Stress Analysis as Related to Tempering and Tempering Kinetics. Eugen Hanke, Kugel- fischer Georg Schäfer &amp; Co. With X-ray stress and fine structure analyses results have been obtained, which are inconsistent with the present views of the structure and tempering kinetics of hardened steels. Experimental results are reported, and an attempt is made to establish a model of the tempering kinetics of hardened steels. It is shown that the Snoek and Cottrell effects are the dominating mechanisms of diffusion and that they lead to the formation of two a- phases of differing carbon content, of which the one with the accumulated carbon finally results in the formation of cementite. 1971 SAE Transactions 710280. Residual Stress in the Induction Hardened Sur- face of Steel. Kentaro Ishii and Mitugi Iwamoto, Japan National Railway; Toshio Shiraiwa and Yoshiyasu Sakamoto, Sumitomo Metal Ind., Ltd. The residual stresses produced by static and progressive induction hardening processes were investigated using different diameter bars and different heating conditions. The x-ray diffraction method of stress measurement was used. Compressive stresses were observed at and slightly below the surface in the hardened zone, while lower compressive stresses or tensile stresses were seen at the ends of this zone. These stresses depended on the shapes and sizes of the heated zone and the cooling patterns. Shot peening was seen to convert the tensile stress to a compressive value. 710281. Residual Stress Measurements in Case-Hardened Steels. Moritaro Motoyama and Hiroshi Hori- sawa, Engineering Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An investigation was made of the effect of material, quench severity and case depth on residual stress pro- duced by carburizing. The distribution of stress was affected by carbon gradient and its effect on the Ms temperature in relation to the temperature gradient as influenced by quench severity. The maximum compressive stress was produced outside the case-core boundary near the location of initial transformation. With a more severe quench, it was brought out near the surface, resulting in a higher stress at the surface. 710282. Residual Stresses in Steel Parts and Single Crystal Silicon. D. A. Pearson, Link-Belt Div., FMC Corp. Examples are given of the heat treatment residual stress and retained austenite distributions in a carburized part, and the residual stress after grinding in another hardened part.

Residual Stresses in Quenched and Tempered Plain Carbon Steels. D. V. Nelson, Catepillar Tractor Co.; R. E. Ricklefs and W. P. Evans, Caterpillar Tractor Co. An investigation was made of factors contributing to maximum compressive residual stress. Stresses from furnace hardening heat treatment were shown to be highest at high hardness, medium carbon content, large section size, and minimum hardenability over the range investigated. Shot peening was found to decrease high heat treatment stresses. An example showed very high fatigue strength in plain carbon steel at high hardness which was related to the very high compressive residual stress induced by severe water quenching during heat treatment. 710284. The Effects of Shot Size on the Residual Stresses Resulting from Shot Peening. G. T. Robertson, Chrysler Corp. This report describes the influence of shot size upon the residual stress curves. It was found that these curves could be represented by a Gaussian type function which clearly illustrated the effect of changing shot size. The results showed that the maximum compression is located in- creasingly further subsurface and the total in depth . influence of the shot peening becomes greater as the shot size is increased. 710285. The Effect of Elevated Temperature Exposure on Residual Stresses. R. W. Diesner, Sundstrand Aviation. Shot peening is commonly used to create residual compressive stresses in part surfaces, thereby reducing the effects of tensile service loads and improving fatigue life. The research reported here was initiated to determine whether or not the residual compressive peening stresses are rapidly annealed out by elevated temperature expo- sure. AISI H-ll and 52100 steels were selected for the tests, peened, and subjected to temperatures up to 800 F for times to 4000 hours. Residual stress measurements were made by X-ray diffraction methods. It was shown that residual stresses are not significantly relieved in 52100 within 10 hours at 400 F, or 4000 hours at 300 F. For H-ll, no change was produced within 10 hours at 800 F or 4000 hours at 500 F. It was found possible to relate the reduction in initial residual com- pressive stress level caused by thermal stress-relief by a parameter of the form P = T (c + log t). 710286. The Determination of the "Ride Transfer" Char- acteristic for a Stationary, Transiently Excited Motor Vehicle. C. G. Watson, Girling Ltd., England. The "ride transfer" characteristic for a motor vehicle is defined as the amplitude ratio of the acceleration response of the vehicle body mass to the force input at the tire/road interface, for a range of forcing frequencies; that is, the ratio is plotted in the frequency domain. The characteristic is of importance for investigating the effects that changes to vehicle mass, spring, and damping parameters have upon passenger riding comfort both during the design and development of a vehicle. The paper describes the testing technique, Fourier Transformation theory, and numerical integration, which is used to transform the data logged recordings of the force input transients and acceleration response tran- sients, from the time domain to the frequency domain. Tests are made on a stationary vehicle in the laboratory. The experimental "ride transfer" characteristics are compared with those obtained for a six degree of freedom mathematical model of the test vehicle. A study of other experimental techniques which have been used for assessing vehicle riding comfort, together with the established vehicle ride comfort criteria is included. 710287. Evaluation of the Lateral Stability of an Auto- mobile with Nonlinear Component to Increasing Magnitude Gust and Tire Load. J. Mahig, University of Florida. Knowledge of that component of a vehicle's handling characteristics represented by the vehicle dynamics is necessary to analyze the driver's role in controlling the vehicle. One aspect of this problem is determination of the effect on the stability under differing road conditions in the linear as well as nonlinear region. The simulation presented evaluates the response of the vehicle suspension system to suddenly applied external impulses which are identified as caused by wind gust and road disturbance. This analysis considers only the effect on the lateral stability of the vehicle. Thus this representation is assumed completely decoupled from the longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle. Proceeding in this fashion makes it possible to study the effect of large wind gust and lateral road impacts on the lateral stability of a vehicle con- taining nonlinear tire characteristics. The effects in the nonlinear region are clearly demonstrated with the aid of a conventional root locus plot. 710288. (SP-363) Principles and Design of Mechanical Truck Transmissions. Charles M. Perkins, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne Inc.

(SP-361) HC/CO Oxidation Catalysts for Ve- hicle Exhaust Emission Control. K. I. Jagel and F. G. Dwyer, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts having good catalytic activity, stability, and improved physical durability were developed. Based on laboratory tests, these catalysts are predicted to be able to meet the Inter-Industry Emission Control (IIEC) program HC and CO emission levels and durability goals in vehicles in which HC, CO, and NOx goals are achieved simulta- neously. However, confirming vehicle tests must be made to validate these predictions. The development of these catalysts has been aided by a mathematical model of the catalytic converter and by some unique experimental techniques. These tools have been used to guide the development, and to evaluate the catalytic activity, chemical stability, and physical dura- bility of the catalysts in laboratory tests. These laboratory tests were complemented by several vehicle durability evaluations which have shown that although the IIEC goals were met initially, they were often exceeded after mileage accumulation. The principal causes for not meeting the goals have been catalyst loss due to inherently low catalyst attrition resistance and inter-particle abrasion caused by inadequate converter design. Improved converter designs and more attrition- resistant catalysts have resulted in significant improve- ments in "on-the-road" durability of these systems. Laboratory tests predict that some of these catalysts will meet IIEC HC and CO goals for more than 12,000 miles with leaded fuel (3.0 gm Pb/gal), and that a larger number will meet these goals for 50,000 miles with low-leaded fuel (0.5 gm Pb/gal) or unleaded fuel. Although most vehicle testing is being done with unleaded fuel in order that acceptable converter and catalyst durability can be demonstrated, the ultimate economic choice for the optimized vehicle-fuel system has not yet been made. 710291.

The objective of this project was to develop and evaluate a catalyst system for oxides of nitrogen control which would achieve target reduction levels established for the Inter- Industry Emission Control (IIEC) program, with con- current control of the hydrocarbons and carbon mon- oxide. The major effort described is the exploration of catalysts and the development of a suitable exhaust gas-temperature environment. The objective was met, with the exception of long-term durability, by using a pelleted, non-noble metal catalyst and a special container design. 1971 SAE Transactions 710292. (SP-361) Catalytic Converter Vehicle System Performance: Rapid Versus Customer Mileage. E. E. Hancock, R. M. Campau and R. Connolly, Ford Motor Co. Two types of catalysts were tested in a fleet of 24 1969 vehicles operated in customer-type urban driving regimes, on both leaded and nonleaded fuels over a period of one and one-half years. The two catalyst types, and the converter systems chosen for this evaluation, were selected on the basis of information obtained from an earlier test program involving four cars which were durability tested on a more rapid "test track mileage accumulation cycle." Comparisons are made between the vehicles running rapid mileage accumulation and the vehicle running slower customer-type mileage accumulation. The results show that catalyst life and system performance depre- ciation were relatively similar in both fleets and did not seem to be significantly affected by the method of mileage accumulation. The 24-vehicle fleet was equipped with a programmed protection system (PPS) designed to protect the catalysts from damage due to over-temperature operation. Prob- lems with this prototype protection system are discussed. Discussion: L. R. Hamkins, American Motors Corp.; Authors' closure 1971 SAE Transactions 710293.

A joint automotive and petroleum research program to develop prototype fuel and hardware requirements for low-emission vehicle systems is described. The relevance of the very stringent emission targets established by the Inter-Industry Emission Control (IIEC) program on the overall improvements in ambient air quality for the Los Angeles Basin is illustrated. Three separate low-emission concept vehicle systems targeted to meet the very stringent emission targets of the IIEC . program are described. Emission performance of these three systems on the recently published, more severe federal exhaust emission test procedures (July 15-No- vember 10, 1970) is given. In addition, preliminary emission data are presented from a fourth low-emission concept vehicle system which combines the emission hardware features of the three earlier systems (thermal reactors with catalysts and an exhaust gas recirculation system). Vehicle fuel economy penalties and operating tem- perature problems of the low-emission concept vehicles are discussed. The limited durability experience to date has defined major problems on critical subsystem com- ponents used in these low-emission concept vehicles. Finally, a projection is made on how the emission levels achieved in these "single-vehicle" research-oriented tests would increase to account for the depreciation of the emission control system with mileage and for the toler- ances and variability existing in mass production.

(SP-361) Effect of Fuel and Lubricant Additives on Exhaust Emissions. L. W. Mixon, American Oil Co., A. I. Rozmanith, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp.; and W. T. Wotring, Stan- dard Oil Company (Ohio). The effect of exhaust emission of additives in engine oil, in gasoline, and injected directly into the exhaust gas was studied. Substantial reduction of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions was obtained only when peroxides were injected in the presence of secondary air, into the exhaust gas at the exhaust port. Fuel additives were evaluated for favorably modifying combustion kinetics, and for reducing hydrocarbon emissions related to combustion chamber deposits and quench volume. No substantial effects were found. Engine oil additive type and concentration also had no substantial effect on hydrocarbon emissions caused by combustion chamber deposits. 1971 SAE Transactions 710296. (SP-361) Small Engine - Concept Emission Vehicles. Yasuo Kaneko, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Hiroshi Kuroda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Kazuyuki Tanaka, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. Three Japanese automobile manufacturers - Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., and Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. - have been making efforts over the past three years to design and develop effective Thermal Reactor- Exhaust Gas Recirculation and Catalytic Converter Systems suitable for small-size engines. This work is being done by members participating in the Inter-Industry Emission Control (IIEC) program. As a result, the exhaust emission levels of the concept vehicles developed by these companies have met the goal established by the IIEC Program at low mileage. Much investigation is required, particularly with respect to durability, before completion of any system that will fully satisfy all service require- ments. This paper reports the progress of research and development of the individual concept vehicles. 1971 SAE Transactions 710297. (P-36) Anatomy and Physiology of the Respi- ratory System. Josef R.

(P-36) Health Aspects of Airborne Polycyclic Hydrocarbons. David L. Coffin, National Air Pollution Control Administration. When polycyclic hydrocarbons in the air are inhaled by man, many links can be found to the development of pulmonary cancer. The paper discusses the amounts of such carcinogens in the air, how they enter the system, and their effects on tissues of animals. An attempt is made to show specifically that particulate matter such as benzo(a)pyrene and other hydrocarbons can induce cancer when intratracheal^ instilled, leading one to conclude that such particulates are dangerous when airborne in the urban environment. 710302. (P-36) Health Aspects of Atmospheric Exposure to Lead. Ralph G. Smith, The University of Michigan. The paper discusses how atmospheric exposure to lead affects health. Sources of lead in the atmosphere are explored, lead aerosol is described, and the importance of lead in the diet is discussed. Methods of detecting lead in the human system are detailed. The paper suggests that a threshold limit of atmospheric lead be firmly established. 1971 SAE Transactions 710303. (P-36) From Air Quality Criteria to Control Regulations. Don Jensen, Ford Motor Co. The paper discusses the need to establish firm control regulations of the amounts of emissions in the air. Methods of calculating emission standards are shown, the advantages of modeling and rollback are considered, and the rollback method is detailed. A simple equation for emission calculation is developed. Various enforcement incentives are discussed, as are federal roles. The paper asks for a balanced approach in calculations of emissions, in enforcement, and in federal regulation. 710304. (P-37) The Generation and Suppression of Aircraft Noise. A. L. McPike, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Advances in commercial aviation depend on continuing developments in aircraft propulsion systems. These pro- pulsion systems for commercial jet transports have progressed from turbojets, to low-bypass-ratio turbofans, to the new high-bypass-ratio turbofans. Flyover noise levels of turbojet-powered airplanes are dominated by the low-frequency roar of the jet-exhaust noise at both takeoff and approach power settings. Jet-noise suppressors developed for these turbojet engines did reduce somewhat the noise levels under the takeoff flight path but did not reduce the levels under the approach flight path. Low-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, such as the P&amp;WA JT3D and JT8D, produced less jet-exhaust noise than the turbojet engines, but the discrete-frequency components of the turbomachinery noise were more prominent. A research program, conducted for the NASA, showed that significant reduction in the level of the turbomachinery noise, on the JT3D-powered transports at approach power settings, could be achieved through the installation of acoustically absorptive duct linings. Re- ductions in the turbomachinery noise were also obtained at the takeoff power setting but the total reduction in engine noise was much smaller than at the approach power setting because of the high level of the jet-exhaust noise. Installations of similar material on JT8D-powered transports are expected to produce smaller noise reduc- tions at both the approach and takeoff power settings than were achieved on the JT3D engines primarily because of the high-level of the jet-exhaust noise on the JT8D. These results clearly indicate the need to reduce jet-exhaust noise to ensure that meaningful reductions in the noise of current aircraft can be accomplished for all airport neighbors. The new high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines (e.g., the P&amp;WA JT9D, the GE CF6, and the Rolls Royce RB-21 1) produce substantially less jet-exhaust noise than the predecessor low-bypass-ratio turbofans. Turbomachinery noise on these new engines was reduced by careful selection of various engine parameters and by installation of acoustic treatment. The use of jet transports powered by these new engines should result in a significant reduction in noise levels for virtually all airport neighbors. 1971 SAE Transactions 710305.

John O. Powers, Federal Aviation Administa- tion; and T. P. Ball, Federal Aviation Admin- istration. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Trans- port Association of America have worked independently and cooperatively for many years to improve the acoustic environment in the vicinity of airports. The present paper reviews noise control operating procedures which have been employed, are currently under development, and which are under consideration. Currently, noise abate- ment power cutback takeoff procedures, maximum alti- tude approaches, and preferential runway systems all are employed to provide noise relief. Any new procedures which are considered for implementation, however, require detailed evaluation for compatibility with the airport/airways environment. 710308. (P-37) Aircraft Noise, Its Source and Reduction. R. E. Russell, The Boeing Co.; and J. D. Kester, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Since the advent of the turbojet engine, there has been much research by aircraft and engine manufacturers into the source of aircraft noise and its reduction. A review of this research is presented delineating the transition from turbojet engines to turbofan engines to the high-bypass-ratio engines being introduced today and the progress that has been made. Application of the current state of the art to existing airplanes through engine replacement, nacelle retrofit and flight procedures is also discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710310. (P-37) Airport and Community Interface. Homer B. Anderson, Louisville &amp; Jefferson County Air Board. This paper presents some of the major concerns regarding the impact of airport facilities and operations on existing communities and the costs and benefits which directly or indirectly result from this newly acquired affluence. The problems of past performance and the necessity for preventive strategies are explored. 710311. (P-37) Aircraft and the Environment - Air- lines/Community. William B. Becker, Air Trans- port Association of America. For many years, the airlines have devoted time, talent, and money to the reduction of both noise and air pollution. The various steps taken by the airlines since 1952 toward noise alleviation are outlined. The need for location government compatible land use control is advocated. The advances made by the airlines in reducing the total amount of pollution created per aircraft engine is described. The further reduction of emissions, as each new jet engine comes into air transport usage, is discussed. 710313. (P-37) Noise as Perceived by the Community. Paul N. Borsky, Columbia University. Different composite noise indexes are compared and CNR or NEF is believed best suited for judging com- munity annoyance and physiological effects. Noise levels in areas close to airports are very high and in some communities may constitute a hazard for hearing loss. Effects of intense noise on other physiological reactions are less well known, but should be studied. Interference with communications and sleep are the most serious effects of aircraft noise exposure, with sleep interruption rated relatively more annoying. Increasing noise accounts for about 25% of the total variance in human annoyance; attitudes, experiences and other human factors are even more important. Responses from persons with only moderate fear of crashes and feelings that authorities are somewhat misfeasant in minimizing noise, indicate that about one-third have "high annoyance" at NEF 20-25, and almost half at NEF 30 + . Measures for noise abatement are briefly described, including a time schedule for reducing maximum noise levels, modifying existing engines, introducing new "quiet" engines producing 10 EPNdB less noise than the existing FAA rule, reducing the number of flights by rationalizing duplicating flights to optimize capacity of airplanes, and development and enforcement of compatible land use zoning regulations. 710314. (P-37) Airport Noise, Sonic Booms, and Public Health. Alexander Cohen, U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare. Different adverse effects of noise are treated in the context of defining public health problems posed by exposure to operational aircraft noise around airports and to sonic booms. These aircraft sounds can affect states of social and mental well-being through masking speech commu- nication or other desired sounds, disrupting behavior and subjective feelings, and interfering with one's needs for privacy, rest, and sleep. Such adverse effects fall short of what may be called mental disorders but the long-term cumulative impact of these noise disturbances remains to be fully evaluated from the standpoint of mental as well as physical health. With regards to the latter, there may be some potential risk of hearing loss caused by the maximum current aircraft noise exposures in neighbor- hoods bordering airports. Evidence for other physical ailments connected with exposures to aircraft sound intruding in airport communities is suggestive at present and will require more medical verification. The most pressing research needs are for retrospective and pro- spective studies of the physical and mental health status of 111</page><page sequence="47">710315-710322 112 communities subjected to different amounts of aircraft noise and sonic booms. 1971 SA E Transactions 710315. (P-37) Noise Exposure Forecasts as Indicators of Community Response. William J. Galloway, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Various national methods for computing the noise exposure from a series of aircraft operations, when compared for a uniform set of operations, tend to converge in their prediction of average community response. Variations in individual's response, as compared to population averages, may be reduced when allowances are made for differing socio-economic status and for the semantic content of the noise. 710316. (P-37) Land Use Strategies for Aircraft Noise Alleviation. Richard H. Broun and James F. Miller, U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The need to reduce airport-community problems will present a major challenge in the quest for environmental improvement. Federal policy to use all practical means and measures to preserve and enhance the environment is evident with the Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and a new focus on the quality of living in the Nation's urban areas is seen in the environmental and planning precondi- tions to the assistance of airport development projects under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970. In order to minimize any adverse impact of airport development, we need to bring land use strategies - land use planning and land use controls - to bear on the achievements of solutions to conflict between airports and other land uses that will protect both the airport and incompatible land uses from encroachment by each other. Land use strategies must be used in combination with programs to reduce noise through source control and flight procedures to minimize noise exposed areas. Metropolitan Aircraft Noise Abatement Policy Studies are being conducted by HUD and DOT to demonstrate a variety of techniques for planning an overall development policy in specific airport locations. It is evident from these studies that there are preventive as well as remedial measures that can be taken to achieve land use compat- ibility and that the potential for land use strategies is strengthened by an inter-community approach which considers planning, land use controls, and development policy options which are in harmony with the goals of the airport and the community in which it is located. 710317. (P-37) Appraisal of Community Response to Aircraft Noise - at the Grass Roots Level. Martin Gach, Federal Aviation Administration. The study provides an appraisal of some of the problems that have developed as the result of the effect of aircraft overflight on neighboring communities, and from the resultant noise emissions. Specific emphasis is placed on the short-term problem and the reaction of individuals or community leaders to the noise experience occasioned by daily operations. Emphasis is also made with respect to the hours of duration of such noise experience and the times of the day. Officials concerned with airport operations and runway usage will have to cope with the problem of community reaction until such time when technical results reduce public reaction. Interim allevi- ation of the problem is discussed with respect to reduced long time runway usage. 710318. (P-37) Status Report on Aircraft and Airports as Sources of Pollution. G. P.

Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</page><page sequence="48">710323-710330 Two aspects of the dispersion of pollutants from aircraft are reviewed. The first is the dispersal of aircraft exhaust emissions in the vicinity of airports; the second is the dispersal of exhaust trails in the upper atmosphere. Techniques available for modeling this dispersal and how they might be applied to the airport problem are discussed. Field studies of airport pollution are then reviewed to assess current pollutant levels around airports and the aircraft's contribution to those levels. The possibility of contrail formation from jet emissions at high altitude is then considered and the effect of uncertainties in the trail mixing processes evaluated. 1971 SAE Transactions 710323. (P-37) Water Vapor Pollution of the Upper Atmosphere by Aircraft. Lester Mach ta, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U. S. Dept. of Commerce. The two combustion products which future technology will be unable to eliminate from present day jet engines are carbon dioxide and water vapor. The potential climatic change effects of carbon dioxide are considered to be a small part of a larger C02 problem. Water vapor added to the troposphere forms contrails. The paper will assess the non-conclusive evidence of increased cirrus cloudiness at certain locations. Finally the potential climatic effects of added water vapor in the stratosphere on the radiation budget, the small decrease in ozone, and polar night cloudiness is evaluated in the light of future commercial aviation injections of water vapor. 710324. (P-37) Air Pollution at Heathrow Airport, Lon- don: April-September, 1970. J. Parker, Warren Spring Lab., England. Calculations have been made of total pollution emissions at Heathrow Airport, London, from aircraft operations, heating installations and road traffic. Comparisons were made of concentrations of pollution levels from the airport and from nearby residential areas. Measurements of smoke, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons and deposited matter were also carried out in different parts of the airport. The results showed that the airport was not contrib- uting unduly to local pollution. At no time did pollution concentrations at the airport ever exceed values which have been found in Central London. The highest values obtained came from road traffic in the Central area. 1971 SAE Transactions 710325. (P-37) Dispersion Modeling of Airport Pollution. N. Milford, G. C. McCoyd, L. Aronowitz and J. H.

Such dispersion models are used to calculate how the pollution emitted from the many contributing sources spreads to affect surrounding areas. This simulation permits a realistic evaluation of possible alternative strategies for air pollution abatement. The basic elements of a modeling problem are seen to be the emission sources, the meteorology, and the dispersion parameters; current methods for handling each of these are explained. The treatment of a sample airport is described and typical results are presented. Finally, the paper indicates some of the areas in which limited knowledge affects the implementation or accuracy of airport dispersion modeling. 1971 SAE Transactions 710326. (P-37) Effects of Air Pollution on Man and His Environment. Delbert S. Barth, Environmental Protection Agency. Air pollutants emitted from turbine engine aircraft may have adverse effects on man and his environment. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, various organic compounds and particulate matter are the primary pollutants pro- duced by jet engines. Carbon monoxide at low levels may cause impairment of time interval discriminations and impairment of visual acuity. Nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced ventilatory performance and an increase in acute respiratory illness. Some organic com- pounds, such as formaldehyde and acrolein, may cause eye irritation while excess of particulate matter in the atmosphere has been associated with increased chronic respiratory disease. In addition to effects on human health, pollutants emitted from turbine engines may adversely affect plants, animals, soil, water and man-made materials. In general much more research is needed before effects on health and welfare can be specifically related to aircraft emissions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710329.

This summary paper introduces the three panelists who have prepared contributing papers and who will sum- marize their own papers, Messrs. Crotti, Meynell, and Pulling. It also attempts to set the stage and highlight some of the issues. The public is increasingly demanding relief from aircraft noise, and demanding evidence that all possible remedial action has been taken. State governments, concerned for the health and welfare of their citizens, are considering whether they may be in an ideal position to act as a regulatory catalyst in this area. 710330. (P-37) The Role of State Government in Aircraft Noise Abatement Regulation. Joseph R. Crotti, State of California. Because of the lack of leadership on the part of the Federal Government to regulate aircraft noise around airports, the California Legislature mandated the Cali- fornia Department of Aeronautics to adopt noise stan- dards to govern aircraft and aircraft engine noise at airports operating under a Permit from the Department. 113</page><page sequence="49">710331-710337 114 These regulations offer a new approach to the control of noise pollution, and the level of noise acceptable to a reasonable person residing in the vicinity of the airport with due consideration of the economic and technological feasibility of complying with the Standards. 1971 SA E Transactions 710331.

Part II summarizes the most significant developments in the realm of Federal legislation and regulation since 1965. Part III reviews the most significant United States court cases in the last five years. It points to the renewed, but largely unsuccessful, efforts to obtain injunctions in airport noise cases and explains their lack of success.

Finally, in Part IV, it discusses some of the reasons why lajid use planning has not been effective in most places and spells out some possible means of improving the legal framework for such planning. 710336. (P-37) Legal Aspects of Military Sonic Booms. William F. McCormack, Dept. of the Air Force. Sonic booms from aircraft are a relatively recent phe- nomena. However, the law has developed to meet the new challenges and old rules of liability have been modified to fit the changed conditions. The following paper is an attempt to show some of the legal developments which have resulted from military supersonic flight, since only military or government type aircraft have flown super- sonically in the United States to date. Various theories of liability for sonic boom damages have been considered by the courts and these are set forth in this article for comparison purposes. From a review of these decisions, we may be able to anticipate how future courts will handle similar problems. 710337. (P-37) Regulation of Pollutant Emissions from Aircraft - Today and Tomorrow. William H. Megonnell, Environmental Protection Agency. Complaints about aircraft emissions began with intro- duction of jets. At airports, aircraft pollutant emission densities are similar to those from other operations in surrounding cities; and as other emissions are controlled, aircraft will become proportionately more significant. The need for control is clear. Low-smoke combustors are being installed voluntarily by airlines, but only after suits were filed by several State air pollution control agencies;</page><page sequence="50">710338-710346 similar voluntary action is expected to solve the fuel- dumping problem. Federal preemption of aircraft emis- sion regulations invalidates State control, and regulations will be published in 1971. 710338. (P-37) Role of NAPCA in Controlling Aircraft Pollutant Emissions. George D. Kittredge and Barry D. McNutt, National Air Pollution Con- trol Administration. The National Air Pollution Control Administration initiated a program in 1967 on the characterization and control of aircraft emissions. The program, which is being carried out through contract research and cooperative government/industry studies, covers the measurement of emissions, development of testing instrumentation and procedures, and basic research in emission control technology. Some of the general results of this program are presented. A brief description of NAPCA's plans for future research is included. The paper concluded with a discussion of possible emission control techniques and regulatory considerations which will affect future stan- dard setting. 1971 SA E Transactions 710339.

Lewis Goldshore, New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection. On August 12, 1969, a civil action for injunctive relief and penalties was commenced by the New Jersey State Department of Health against the major airlines using Newark Airport. The lawsuit was the natural outgrowth of more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts by the state to have the problem of jet aircraft smoke corrected. The case was eventually settled by a stipulation, the terms of which provided that the airlines would immediately embark upon a corrective program to retrofit existing aircraft with smokeless combustor cans, which program would be substantially completed by December 31, 1972. This paper examines the chronology of New Jersey's abortive attempts to abate the problem and analyzes the elements of the successful legal action. 710341. (P-37) Airport Planning for Environmental Qual- ity. Robert F. Bacon, Federal Aviation Admin- istration. The airport operator, contemplating a new era of unprecedented airport expansion, is seriously concerned that the myriad of environmental protection laws and policies will prevent solving the airport dilemma. The FAA is optimistic that the environmental requirements, along with new planning resources, will cause airport development activities to steer a different but highly productive course. The climate for development had been poor before the new statutes and could very well be improved in that a well informed public and an environ- mentally acceptable airport could be the trend of the future. 710342. (P-37) An Environmental Approach to Air Trans- portation Needs: Guidelines for Federal Assis- tance. Martin Convisser, U. S. Dept. of Trans- portation. If poorly planned, the development of our air transpor- tation system will be impeded by unnecessary conflicts between airports and their neighbors. A thorough con- sideration of environmental factors is now required by three Federal statutes- the Airport and Airway Devel- opment Act of 1970, the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environment and Urban Systems, the focal point for environmental concerns in DOT, is giving particular attention to development of a more integrated and intermodal planning process, which is the key to the attainment of environmental objectives. 710343.

(P-37) Planning for Compatibility of Aircraft and Environment. Robert C. Einsweiler, Metropol- itan Council, St. Paul, Minn. If airports compatible with the environment are to be built, changes must be made in the decision making process- what is studied, who participates, and who decides. The current emphasis on reducing the noise and pollution effects of airports offers long term solutions to compatibility, but limited improvement during the decade of the 70's. An expansion of the scope of the airport system plan and airport master plan is proposed aug- mented by a new operations plan. 710346. (P-37) Strategies of Noise Abatement Through Land Use. Richard B. Ross, Market Facts, Inc. Because it is very unlikely that aircraft noise will be eliminated or reduced to a manageable level by tech- 115</page><page sequence="51">710347-710356 116 nological improvements, land use strategies which sub- stitute non-noise sensitive uses for very sensitive uses in high noise exposure zones are necessary. Differences between old and new airports call for somewhat different strategies. Possible strategies include zoning, building code modifications, land-banking, and purchases of dwellings in isolated areas. All strategies have limitations and potential adverse effects on community goals other than noise reduction. Implementation of any of the strategies is complex, requiring compromises among competing groups and community goals. 710347. (P-37) Environmental Quality: The Integration of Development and Natural Resources. Alan Robinette, Enviromedia, Inc. The applications of natural resource analysis can and should be directed to all phases of planning, including site or corridor selection, design, construction, and operation. Based on present capability to interpret and use natural resource systems as parameters for development decisions as well as for conservation decisions, the basic strategy for perpetuating natural resource values must be to alter our conception from that of preservation versus consumption within a specific sector to one of integration and optimizing the total system. Similarly, to allow a common base for total planning applications, the con- ception that natural resources have uniform requirements for protection should be replaced by the recognition that each resource system has a varying level of vulnerability and sensitivity beyond which development cannot be tolerated. The assumption that development and protection are not, in reality, competing throughout the total environ- mental system is evident through the realization that resources are highly variable in composition and pattern. Optimizing each site to its intrinsic capacity will result in the complete spectrum of use and intensity with enough flexibility to accommodate growth and change. 710348. (P-37) Communities Act to Reduce the Impact of Jet Aircraft Noise. William Goedike, City of Inglewood, California. This paper describes what communities have done and can do to reduce the impact of aircraft noise. Specifically, the historical action of Hempstead, New York, the Ten Point Program of Inglewood, California, and the Inter- national Airport development at Kansas City, Missouri, are outlined in some detail. Also, the paper presents an integrated plan for achieving a reasonable noise environment in the future. The plan is based on establishment of nationwide goals, on improved communication and decision making be- tween communities and airports, and on a new concept of economic incentives which makes noise pollution a cost factor in industry decision making. 1971 SA E Transactions 710350. (P-37) Comprehensive Planning and Aircraft Noise at Kansas City International Airport. John L. Taylor and Robert A. Kipp, City of Kansas City, Missouri. The City of Kansas City, Missouri, has undertaken a new development guidance system in the vicinity of Kansas City International Airport. This airport is an entirely new public transportation facility now in the final construction stages and expected to be operational by 1972. The development guidance system is designed to take account of environmental noise utilizing FAA noise exposure forecasts in conjunction with land use control zones. 710351. (P-37) Aviation, the Environment, and the Public Interest. Gary A. Soucie, Friends of the Earth. The central challenge facing aviation today is its com- patibility with the natural and social environment. So far the aviation community has tried to duck this challenge by minimizing the environmental problems associated with aviation. Many of aviation's environmental problems have been caused by the failure of aviation planning, which has been honored in the breach. With the politicization of environmental concern, aviation faces an era in which its progress will be determined in part by the many decisions made necessary by the environmental crisis. Air progress will be measured in the future not by "economy, speed, or power, but the quality of life that results." 710352. (P-37) Are the Airport and the City Compatible? Joseph A. Murray, Dept. of Marine &amp; Aviation, City of New York. Are the airport and the city compatible? An unqualified resounding "YES" is the only realistic answer here. For there are new ways and means at hand to achieve this elusive but necessary goal. The burden of proof rests squarely on the engineers, planners and responsible government officials to make it so. They can do this through the application of existent technology and techniques and most especially through new planning approaches. Moreover they can achieve this goal with minimal costs and maximum permanent benefits. 710353. (P-37) Fly Now, Pay Now. John A. McCauley, Columbia University. Various factors are changing the nature of the arena in which decisions affecting the air transportation industry are made. Public concern about the deterioration of the environment is among the chief factors. The responses to, and outcomes of this public pressure are becoming visible. The ability of the existing governmental-industrial rela- tionship to cope with the necessity of reordering both their own and the public's priorities to place the environment on a higher level is being tested and assessed. It will be several years before the capability and willingness of the current system to make the necessary adjustments can be judged. However, enough time has now passed that some preliminary judgments can be made and possibilities foreseen. 710356. Investigation of the Mechanism of Exhaust Valve Seat Wear in Engines Run on Unleaded Gasoline.</page><page sequence="52">710357-710363 Douglas Godfrey and Richard L. Courtney, Chevron Research Co. Valve seat wear or "sinkage" or "recession" was observed in eight engines run on unleaded fuel. Detailed studies of valve seat wear were undertaken in a 302 cu in. V8 engine run for 10-1/4 hr at WOT on a dynamometer stand. The seat was oxidized and flaky, and the valve face was spotted with hard (45-55 Rockwell C) oxide nodules. It was concluded that during operation, the oxide flakes adhere to the valve face to form nodules which become embedded in the metal (43 Rockwell C). With the embedded nodules, the valve wears the cast-iron seat (40 Rockwell C) by abrasion. Loads, rotation, and temper- atures are often influencing factors. The use of unleaded fuel in another engine was found to form PbO*PbS04 on the hot valve face and Pb(C 10.758^25)2 on the cooler seat. These compounds are high-temperature solid-film lubricants which, by coating the surface, inhibit cast-iron oxidation and also prevent material transfer. 1971 SAE Transactions 710357. SAE Lighting Standards for Passenger Car- Trailer Combinations. Bernard R. Weber, Wes- bar Corp. The great number of trailers on the highways has resulted in expanded regulations covering lights and reflectors, and car power circuitry now needs to be made compatible with increased lighting requirements. Standardization is needed with respect to the connection of trailer lights and the grounding of trailer frame to car frame, as well. A standardized car-trailer connector suitable for use in more than one combination of trailer plug with a single- receptacle car connector is another necessity. These requirements suggest the advisability of devel- oping recommended practices for the above situations. An SAE standard should also be prepared to include portions of current SAE electrical standards now applicable to car-trailer lighting and featuring an expansion into new problem areas in this field. 710358. SAE Trailer Hitch Standard J684c - Its Early History and Current Developments. William E. Dotterweich, Valley Tow-Rite, Inc. The history and basis of the SAE trailer hitch standard are reviewed, with a discussion of the present state-of-the-art in the hitch industry. Current developments considered include federal regulation of towing systems, extensive industry testing programs, and bolt-on receivers for load-distributing hitches. 710359. Auto Trailer Combinations; Their Potential and Problems. Keith D. Kroll, AIRSTREAM. The existing trailer population is broken down giving the types, weights, and quantity; it is expanded to estimates of this population in 1975. Existing SAE practices, rec- ommendations, and specifications are reviewed, along with proposed government regulations. Areas where technical information must be developed are presented; this includes combination vehicle dynamics, hitching, braking, lighting, and combination electrical systems. 710360. Development of Brake Standards SAE J134 and J135 for Combination of Vehicles. B. L. Doug- lass, Atwood Vacuum Machine Co. With the advent of increasing numbers of heavier passenger car-trailer combinations, the need for a uniform brake test procedure code and recommended level of performance requirements for such combination of vehi- cles became apparent. Initial efforts were directed toward a standard of performance for the trailer or towed vehicle brakes only, but as the work progressed a more practical solution evolved in a test code, SAE J 134, and per- formance requirements, SAE J 135, for passenger car- trailer combinations. It is intended that light trucks will be considered in a later revision. 710361. Research in Automobile Dynamics - A Computer Simulation of General Three-Dimensional Mo- tions. Raymond R. McHenry, Cornell Aero- nautical Lab., Inc. A digital computer simulation of complex, three-dimen- sional dynamics of automobiles on irregular terrain is described which is suitable for studies related to vehicle braking systems and to the driving task, including the upper limits of control as well as the linear ranges of operation. The reported simulation is an extended version of an earlier, validated mathematical model. A number of refinements and extensions of the analytical treatments of tire forces, suspension properties, and terrain definitions, have been incorporated. Also, analytical representations of the braking system and driveline, and approximations of rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, have been introduced. Sample outputs of the modified computer program are presented and discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710362. Future Powerplants to Combat Air Pollution. C. G. A. Rosen, TRA Associates, Inc. The widely recognized necessity for substantially reducing air pollution caused by the automotive powerplant before the end of the century has led to much experimentation. Both government and industry must bear the responsi- bility for improving the engine itself and the fuel it consumes. Promising alternatives to present vehicles include a gas turbine engine with regenerator, a hybrid engine com- bining a low-powered, fuel burning engine with electric batteries. New fuels - the currently available low-lead and no-lead gasolines, natural gas and liquid propane gas, dual fuel systems, and even fuel cells - are also being investigated. Cars incorporating the eventual solution, closed-loop systems, should be available by the year 2000. 710363. Aluminum Forgings for Ground Vehicles. C. L. Burton, ALCOA Cleveland Works. 117</page><page sequence="53">710364-710370 118 The development of forged aluminum alloy parts must take into account the characteristics of aluminum alloys, particularly those relating to strength, weight, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. Careful design and testing are required to develop adequate parts with maximum economy. Many of the successful applications of aluminum alloy forgings in ground vehicles are considered; these include use in high-performance and heavy-duty vehicles and in diesel engine mounts and pistons. 710364. Effects of Fuel Factors on Emissions. S. S. Sorem, Shell Development Corp. Possibilities for the reduction of automobile emissions by changes in gasoline composition have been reviewed. Small benefits are achievable by limiting front end volatility and light olefin content. California has already passed legislation which places limits on these fuel properties. Fuel hydrocarbon type, octane number and lead antiknock content are interrelated. Maintenance of octane number while removing lead can be achieved by increas- ing the fuels aromatic content with a resulting increase in some aspects of the exhaust's reactivity. Alternatively lead may be removed without changing hydrocarbon com- position if the engine's octane number requirement is reduced. These changes may result in lower exhaust efficiency and hence higher exhaust flow rates. The net effect on pollutant emissions is in doubt. Gasoline additives, other than lead, make little direct contribution to the pollutant content of exhaust. They do perform functions which minimize the deterioration of an engine's emission characteristics. 710365. Vehicle Emissions - How We are Winning the War on Air Pollution. G. A. Lacy, Chrysler Corp. The efforts of the automobile industry to reduce exhaust emissions have resulted in many improvements and reductions of exhaust pollutants in the past ten years. The facts presented in this paper tend to refute the necessity for stricter legal restrictions on antipollution components in cars and it is suggested that the additional costs that buyers will assume could well be directed elsewhere to better advantage in controlling atmospheric pollution. 710366. Measurements as a Science Rather Than an Art. Jerry Lee Hall, Iowa State University. The idea of making a measurement with an energy conversion device called a transducer is presented. Types of transducers are discussed, and their important char- acteristics are defined and discussed. Several examples are presented to illustrate how transducer characteristics and equations of operation are evaluated. Finally, the gener- alized measurement problem is presented and discussed in terms of obtaining valid data in order that the concept of making measurements can be treated as a science rather than as an art. 710367. Engines and Effects of Lead-Free Gasoline. A. E. Felt and R. V. Kerley, Ethyl Corp. The use of lead-free gasoline in conventional passenger car engines poses some problems that are discussed in this paper. Under heavy-duty operation, severe exhaust valve seat wear may occur. This will eventually result in one or more valves remaining open with extremely high exhaust emissions. The combustion chamber deposits formed in the absence of lead are typically more carbonaceous. These deposits have a higher heat capacity than lead deposits, and the result, after extended mileage, is higher octane number requirements for the engines operated on non- leaded gasoline. The use of aromatic blending stocks to increase the octane number of nonleaded fuels to approach the octane quality of today's leaded gasolines increases undesirable exhaust emissions. The amounts of phenol, benzaldehyde, and total aromatic aldehydes in the exhaust gas are directly proportional to the aromaticity of the fuel. Polynuclear aromatics in the exhaust are also propor- tionally increased with an increase in aromaticity. In addition, the photochemical reactivity of automobile emissions may be increased by as much as 38%. 710368. Valve Problems with Lead Free Gasoline. Wil- liam Giles, TRW Valve Div. Use of lead free gasoline results in severe exhaust valve recession in light duty engines. Recession proceeds 10-20 times faster than with leaded fuel, and occurs on the integral cylinder head seats. A wear model is proposed which identifies parameters contributing to recession. Engine tests showed valve seat angle and cylinder head seat hardness and/or structure to be most significant in reducing seat wear. Coatings, wider seats and improved valve train stability all show plus effects but were insufficient by themselves to stabilize wear rates. Wide seats, use of seat inserts and lower seat angles resulted in shortened valve burning life in engines run with leaded gasoline. Induction hardened cylinder heat seats reduced wear with no effect on valve durability. 1971 SA E Transactions 710369. Development of a Single-Grade General Aviation Avgas. H. J. Foster and L. G. Olson, Shell Oil Co. To verify the practicality of a single-grade general aviation avgas which would meet the needs of engines using grade 80/87 and 100/130 fuel, a flight evaluation was conducted in selected light aircraft. Some 2200 hr of actual flight operation demonstrated the acceptability of this fuel for grade 80/87 certificated aircraft, together with a per- formance advantage for grade 100/130 users. 710370. Exhaust Emissions of Light Aircraft. W. C. Zegel, A. F. Souza and L. R. Reckner, Scott Research Labs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate exhaust</page><page sequence="54">710371-710379 emissions of representative aircraft as they were flown in a normal manner. At the same time, the extent of after- burning was measured by sampling the exhaust plume downstream of the exhaust stack and comparing the plume composition, corrected for dilution, to the com- position of the stack gases. Exhaust emissions from nine light aircraft were determined, using a nine-mode takeoff- cruise-landing (TCL) cycle developed for this study. Exhaust component concentrations and fuel consumption rates were measured for each mode during ten test flights per aircraft. Pollutant concentrations were converted to emission rates per pound of fuel, per minute, per mode, per TCL cycle, and per landing-takeoff (LTO) cycle. 1971 SA E Transactions 710371. Aircraft Carburetor Icing Studies. L. Gardner, G. Moon and R. B. Whyte, National Research Council of Canada. A study has been made of the effect of gasoline icing inhibitors on aircraft carburetor icing. An engine test was developed and used to evaluate various types of inhibitor. The results obtained showed that aircraft carburetor icing can be prevented by the inclusion of additives in the gasoline. The use of a Teflon-coated throttle plate to prevent ice adhesion was studied, and it was found that virtually all ice formation on the plate was eliminated. The Teflon- coated plate and the use of ethylene glycol monomethyl either at 0.10-1.15% by volume in the gasoline were shown to prevent both carburetor and fuel system icing. 710372. The FAA Flying and Handling Qualities Pro- gram. Jerome Teplitz, FAA. Efforts are being made to correlate aircraft stability and control requirements. The objective of this FAA program is to develop flight characteristics criteria which will be acceptable for all aircraft, existing and yet-to-come, military and civilian. 710373. Flying Qualities Criteria for Small General Aviation Airplanes as Determined by In-Flight Simulation. David R. Ellis, Princeton University. In-flight simulation techniques using a variable-stability airplane have been used to determine quantitative flying qualities criteria for small general aviation aircraft. Recent experiments covering longitudinal short-period frequency and damping, pitch control sensitivity, and lift-curve slope indicate that the combination of parameters giving the best level of flying qualities can be identified, but reasonably wide variations are possible without causing serious degradation. Instrument approaches can be suc- cessfully flown with moderate levels of static instability, but even small instabilities may be undesirable due to the danger of upsets following pilot distraction. 710374. Lateral-Directional Handling Qualities for the Executive Jet in the Landing Approach. G. Warren Hall, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. Lateral-directional handling qualities for executive jet and related medium weight airplanes in the landing approach flight phase was investigated in the USAF/CAL variable stability T-33 airplane. Emphasis was placed on the effects of crosswinds and turbulence. Simulated IFR ILS ap- proaches and VFR offset and crosswind approaches were made. Specifically, two Dutch roll frequencies, three Dutch roll damping ratios, three roll-to-sideslip ratios, and three roll mode time constants were investigated. It was found that the ranges of lateral-directional dynamics investigated do not establish a limiting cros- swind approach can be accomplished. Roll control power requirements were determined from pilot control usage data and an investigation of the effects of limited roll control power. It was found that available roll control power can establish a limiting crosswind component. 710376. Low Maintenance Cost is a Prime Factor in Direct Revenue Producing Equipment. John V. Gibbons, Jr., Executive Airlines. Low maintenance costs are of great essence, in order to keep expenses below income and to build-up profits. In the airline industry, after the initial cost of equipment, large sums of money are spent on this equipment toward upkeep and repairs. Therefore, reliable design and constant safety im- provements are very valuable to reduce man-hours and maintenance expenses. 710377. Maintainability is Evident in Many Varying Degrees. Sam J. Corso, Federal Aviation Ad- ministration. The role the FAA plays in promoting maintainability as an inherent characteristic of design is discussed. Some of the parameters used by FAA maintenance specialists in evaluating new designs are accessibility, inspectability, serviceability, replaceability, and reliability. Manufactur- er's servicing and maintenance manuals are also reviewed. Advances in computer technology will bring about changes in maintenance concepts regarding business aircraft. Benefits derived will affect cost, reliability, and safety. 710378. NASA Aerodynamic Research Applicable to Business Aircraft. Laurence K. Loftin, Jr. and Marion O. McKinney, Jr., NASA Langley Research Center. A review is made of NASA aerodynamic research of interest to the designer of business aircraft. The results of wind-tunnel and flight studies of several current aircraft are summarized. The attainment of STOL performance is discussed and the effectiveness of several lift augmen- tation concepts is examined. Finally, the potentialities and problems of flight at and beyond the speed of sound are discussed. 710379. A Review of the University of Kansas Light Airplane Research Program. D. L. Kohlman and J. Roskam, University of Kansas. 119</page><page sequence="55">710380-710386 120 Significant progress has been made in several areas of research relating to general aviation technology at the University of Kansas. This paper describes the design and operation of the major systems of a fixed-base visual and instrument flight simulator, now operating as a valuable research tool in configuration analysis, handling qualities research, control system and cockpit design studies, and other areas. Also included is a report on the status of a NASA sponsored project on improvements in light aircraft design, with attention focused on the wing design, high lift systems, spoiler lateral controls, and a direct lift system. Results of theoretical and wind tunnel studies in these areas are being incorporated in a Cessna 177 Cardinal for an extensive flight test program next year. A brief discussion is also given of two projects recently initiated which will investigate the use of separate auxiliary control surfaces for stability augmentation and for gust alleviation. 710380. The Turn Rate Indicator - Its Interpretation as Affected by Installation and True Airspeed. G. W. Stinnett, C. T. Jackson, Jr. and P. D. Talbot, Ames Research Center, NASA. The effects of mounting an airplaine turn rate gyro at various angles relative to the roll axis of the vehicle have been investigated in flight. The range of suitable mounting angles varies not only with the amount of roll rate sensing desired for lead information, but also with the true airspeed of the airplane. Tilting the gyro in a face-up direction, as occasionally happens on a slightly inclined instrument panel, might have disastrous results if the instrument is relied on for recovery from an unusual attitude. Turn rate information is of very limited value on airplanes having high subsonic cruise speed. 710381. Time Between Overhaul as Related to Modern Engine Design and Maintenance Techniques. R. B. Ingram, Avco Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. Time between overhauls (TBO) of above 2000 hr for certain Lycoming aircooled aircraft piston engines are shown to be practical through the use of modern engine design, materials, and maintenance technology, including the use of spectrograph oil analysis (SOAP). Several examples of extended time programs with their attendant problems are shown for a 150 bhp direct drive, 4-cyl engine and more sophisticated 380 bhp 6-cyl geared and 310 bhp turbocharged engines. Limiting TBO factors and practical limits of TBO are also discussed. 710382. Development of a Dual Ignition System for General Aircraft. Richard P. McClelland, The Bendix Corp. A new dual magneto has been developed for use on engines in business and small military aircraft. This ignition system represents a considerable advance in the areas of weight saving, ease of installation, maintain- ability, and synchronization of the two sparks in each cylinder. This paper describes the reasons for its devel- opment, design details, and the test program followed in its development. It includes a discussion of the problems encountered during testing and the natures of their solutions. 710383. General Aviation Engine Oil Filtration - A Model Specification. William M. Paradise, Champion Spark Plug Co.; and H. C. Mouwen, PurOlater, Inc. A filter's design and performance requirements should be set forth in terms of a specification. A model specification is presented, which includes the important requirements for an engine lube oil filter. A filter's design, construction, and performance, as supported by quality assurance in terms of qualification and production acceptance testing, insure both the equipment manufacturer and user of performance in accordance with established standards. 710384. Noise Certification of Business Jet Aircraft. William J. Galloway, Bolt Beranek and New- man Inc. Noise certification under FAR Part 36 is now a require- ment for issuance of all new and supplemental type certificates for turbojet-powered or transport-category aircraft. Recent experience with three noise certification programs has shown: how to estimate, from aircraft performance data, the necessity and extent of noise measurement requirements, ways to show compliance through the use of equivalent test data, and techniques for minimizing program cost. 710385. The PT6 After 5 Million Hours. F. R. Cowley, United Aircraft of Canada Ltd. The first PT6A-6 turboprop engine, rated at 500 shp, was delivered in December 1963 with an initial life of 600 hr between overhauls. By early 1971, over 4000 engines had been delivered, the output had grown to 900 shp, and times between overhaul in excess of 5000 hr had been reached. The technology spawned by the PT6 has resulted in the development, by UACL, of a host of turboprop, turboshaft, and turbofan engines, along with industrial derivatives. In over 5 million hr of operation, the PT6 has clearly demonstrated how sound technology and per- sistent development can meet the exciting challenges of the 1970s. 710386. Engine Nacelle Noise Prediction and Trades. Henry F. Veldman, The Boeing Co. The object of engine nacelle noise prediction is to use aircraft sound data measured at a test site or measured from fly-over data and estimate the noise level as a function of time at other hypothetical observer locations. The simulation consists of applying attenuation corrections to the input sound pressure spectra to obtain the projected spectra as a function of time. The effect of acoustic noise suppression can be</page><page sequence="56">710387-710393 analyzed by examining the influence of each noise source on the total noise spectra. Trade studies can be conducted by constructing lines of constant annoyance for aircraft landing, takeoff, or fly-by. 710387. Application of Spoilers to a Small, Fixed-Wing General Aviation Aircraft. John W. Olcott and David R. Ellis, Aeronautical Research Asso- ciates of Princeton, Inc.; and Alan E. Fayé, Ames Research Center, NASA. Results of a preliminary flight evaluation of the appli- cation of spoilers/dive brakes to a small, fixed-wing general aviation aircraft are presented. Steady state flight path angles up to 13 deg for a true airspeed of 85 mph were obtained with a spoiler/dive brake area of 5.7 sq ft. No change in trim airspeed was experienced for that configuration provided 15 deg of flaps were used. An 11.92 sq ft spoiler/dive brake configuration produced steady state flight path angles up to 18 deg at 90 mph true airspeed. Preliminary evaluations conducted by two pilots indicated that the former configuration offered significant improvements in the vehicle's handling qualities during the total landing tasks, provided a suitable means of controlling the considerable performance of the spoilers/ dive brakes was available. This was done by integrating their function with power changes such that the throttle became an authoritative and effective flight path angle control. Controlling the throttle and spoilers separately was acceptable provided the operation of the spoiler control handle was similar to the operation of the throttle, and both handles could be grasped in one hand simul- taneously. A spoiler control handle which was physically separated from the throttle by a large distance was unacceptable and potentially dangerous. 710388. The Influence of Bobweights and Downsprings on Flying Qualities. T. Peter Neal, Cornell Aero- nautical Lab., Inc. Control-system bobweights and downsprings are quite often used in general aviation airplanes to improve longitudinal static stability at aft e.g. positions. However, these devices can also have strong and usually undesirable effects on the airplane's dynamic behavior. These impor- tant effects are reviewed and discussed. In addition, guidance is provided as to how some of the undesirable characteristics can be minimized by careful design. 710389. Low-Speed Airfoil Analysis Using a Small Digital Computer. W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University; J. A. Miller, The Boeing Co.; and R. E. Koepsel, Kiekhaefer Mercury Corp. A computing routine has been developed for calculation of two-dimensional incompressible airfoil characteristics on a small (IBM 1130) digital computer. Theodorsen's method of conformai transformation is utilized to obtain potential flow pressure distributions. A selection of quadrature methods are utilized to obtain boundary layer characteristics, including laminar and turbulent layers, instability, transition, and separation. Selected results are presented which illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the program. Typical computing times and costs are presented. Several suggested improvements to the cal- culation routine are discussed. 710390. Chemical Oxygen Generators for Business and Utility Aircraft. V. N. Harwood, ATO, Inc. New FAA Oxygen Requirements Standards state that emergency supplemental oxygen is a necessity in any pressurized aircraft flying over 25,000 ft. Chemical oxygen generators can be used to fulfill the new requirements. They offer savings in weight, size, and maintenance, while offering considerably greater safety. The oxygen generator packages, which offer variation of function and size, are discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710391. Air Conditioning the Piper Cherokee Product Line. J. L. Jiruska, Piper Aircraft Corp. For many years, the designers of general aviation light aircraft have been more preoccupied with safety and performance than comfort. In order to expand the user base and utility of the small airplane, we must provide the elementary comforts which we have come to demand from our automobiles. We are currently working to improve sound levels, seating comfort, ventilation, and other human factors; now we must air condition. This paper will not deal with the basics of refrigeration system design as many books are available on this subject. We will touch briefly on a review of system theory and types, then take you through the conceptual thinking, design considerations, certification, and service test phases of our program. 710392. Optimizing the Design of the Battery-Start- er/Generator System. John M. Evjen and Lawr- ence D. Miller, Jr., General Electric Co. Aircraft starting and generating systems heretofore have been largely the result of joining together available components. Recent studies have demonstrated that substantial benefits in weight, cost, size, and performance may be realized through a total system approach. This paper identifies the types of information required, and the methods of system analysis employed, to design an optimized system. 710393. A Flight Control System Providing A Simple- to-Fly, Constant Attitude Aircraft. Frederick O. Smetana, North Carolina State University. Most light aircraft accidents occur during landing and takeoff because at these times the pilot must operate controls frequently and precisely and with more than average force. These operations are further complicated by the nose-high attitude of the aircraft, which interferes with a normal visual control reference. The purpose of the 121</page><page sequence="57">710394-710400 122 studies reported here was to design an aircraft that would fly at zero pitch angle and would require a minimum of pilot commands for satisfactory operation. Preliminary investigation showed that it would be possible to modify an existing airplane by providing a three-component control system, new wing with Fowler flaps for life modulation, and additional longitudinal control power. The details for these modifications are described fully in this paper. 710394. Qualification of Light Aircraft for Flight in Icing Conditions. Paul R. Leckman, Cessna Aircraft Co. Since light aircraft are being used more and more frequently in the IFR environment, icing is becoming a greater operational problem. This paper reviews the icing problem for light aircraft. Design criteria and flight testing techniques are discussed. The discussion is limited to general aviation aircraft whose maximum takeoff gross weight is less than 6000 lb. Both theoretical and flight test data are reviewed. Data are included which describe - the increase in instrument-rated pilots and IFR flying activity in recent years. Flight profiles of a typical light aircraft are compared with larger aircraft. Performance penalties due to ice accumulations are presented for light aircraft, based on flight test experience to date at the Commercial Aircraft Div. of Cessna Aircraft Co. 1971 SA E Transactions 710395. Toxicological Investigation of Aircraft Accidents: Selected Case Reports from 450 Fatal Aircraft Accidents. Delbert J. Lacefield and Paul W. Smith, Federal Aviation Administration. The Pharmacology-Biochemistry Laboratory began to perform forensic toxicology in connection with investi- gation of fatal aircraft accidents in 1967. In 20% of the pilots involved in 450 accidents studied to date, drugs, alcohol, or carbon monoxide have been found at signif- icant levels and may have contributed to the occurrence of the accident. This paper deals primarily with a group of miscel- laneous findings which should be of interest to accident investigators and pilots: possible significance of Cholin- esterase measurements after fire and of alcohol after immersion, pilots flying after refusal of licensure for medical reasons, complications introduced by passengers, negative findings when positive findings might have been anticipated, and large quantities of drugs in pilot's possession. 710396. Crashworthy Personnel Restraint Systems for General Aviation. Russell A. Hughes, Pacific Scientific Co. Effective personnel restraint systems incorporating upper torso restraint have been developed for general aviation. These systems stress safety, comfort, economy, ease of installation, and generation of user confidence. Inertia or force sensing reels and single point buckles are integral parts of the systems. The system for personal and private flying adds comfort and convenience to the familiar automotive type harness, while the system for business aircraft or other aircraft with structural seats utilizes the experience gained on thousands of commercial transport aircraft. 710397. U. S. General Aviation Safety Record. C. O. Miller, Paul Alexander and Starke Jett, National Transportation Safety Board. The General Aviation safety record through 1970 is discussed, both statistically and in the non-quantitative sense. Related functions of the cognizant aviation acci- dent investigatory agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, are also reviewed to place the data in proper perspective. Finally, a matrix is provided as an outline for participants in the General Aviation system to assess their own contribution to accident/injury prevention in this most rapidly growing segment of aviation. 710399. Crash Injury Severity as Related to Aircraft Attitude During Impact. Terry F. Wallace and John J. Swearingen, Federal Aviation Admin- istration. A small number of general aviation aircraft accidents selected from the files of the Civil Aeromedicai Institute illustrate potential injury severity in various crash situa- tions. It appears that crash injuries, especially to the head and chest, are apt to be more severe in aircraft involved in forward, right side up crash decelerations in which the occupants are restrained by seat belts only. Minor injury, severe crashes are described in which the principle crash forces were: to the side, forward with the aircraft inverted, or forward with the aircraft right side up but with the occupants utilizing both seat belt and shoulder harness restraint. Apparently to avoid serious injury in general aviation crash impacts, one must avoid striking the rigid, nonpadded instrument panel. In addition, a single case is presented to illustrate the high probability of injury to the spine and internal organs in present-day aircraft when the principle crash forces are vertical. 710400. Structural Considerations of Steel Landing Gear Springs. Don McCosh, Cessna Aircraft Co. Aircraft produced by Cessna have, for a number of years, used steel landing gear springs as the major portion of the aircraft main or tail landing gears. These steel springs are relatively simple in design manufacture, and have proved to be durable. This paper discusses some of the factors involved in the design of a spring steel landing gear, analysis methods, and design goals used at Cessna. Certification require- ments and methods of compliance for landing gears are also discussed. The analysis methods employed have been proved acceptable by the ability of the gears to pass</page><page sequence="58">710401-710411 certification tests without modification, and by service experience. 710401. Analytical Simulation of Landing Gear Dynamics for Aircraft Design and Analysis. J. F. Furnish and D. E. Anders, Cessna Aircraft Co. This paper presents an analysis of a nonlinear landing gear mounted on a flexible airplane equipped with external stores and tip tanks. Interaction effects of the flexible airplane with the gear are included. The method of treating the strut lockup-breakout phenomena is an improvement over previous work. Test results are pre- sented from a full scale test of an airplane supported on displacement controlled hydraulic actuators, which sim- ulated taxiing over discrete runway bumps. The analytical method was applied to several design problems which are also discussed. 710403. FAR 23 Fatigue Substantiation Procedures: GAMA Committee Report. R. D. Christian, Aero Commander Div., North American Rockwell Corp. A project group of representatives of General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) companies was established and given the assignment to study several methods of fatigue evaluation and recommend procedures for compliance with new FAA regulations concerning fatigue of aircraft wings. The group held several meetings in which sources of data and the major problems associated with fatigue evaluation were discussed. The author served as chairman of the project group and reports in this paper on the studies and recommendations made by the group. 710404. Fatigue Substantiation Procedures for General Aviation Aircraft Structures. Arnold E. Ander- jaska, Federal Aviation Administration. Fatigue substantiation of wing structure on small air- planes is now required by the Federal Aviation Regu- lations for civil type certification of new designs. Methods for substantiation of this structure under the "safe-life" concept, including suggested loading spectra and pro- cedures for strength determination are outlined. The background leading to these methods and a basis for establishing scatter factors are presented. Procedures for substantiation under the "fail-safe" concept are also given. 710405. Wheel Force Measurement with Axle-Mounted Gages. J. David Long and Ronald W. Orme, Deere &amp; Co. A method is presented for measuring individual wheel loadings with strain gages mounted on a rotating axle. The mechanics of the system are discussed and the instru- mentation required for obtaining the necessary signal outputs is described. 710406. Occupant Impact Injury Tolerances for Aircraft Crashworthiness Design. Richard G. Snyder, The University of Michigan. Human impact injury and survival tolerance levels for various crash conditions are presented on the basis of currently available biomedical and biomechanical knowl- edge. Consideration of physical factors influencing trau- ma - including body orientation, restraint system, mag- nitude, distribution, and time duration of deceleration - are summarized, as well as tabulations and sources of data for both whole body and regional impact tolerances. These biological data concerning human impact toler- ances are provided as guidelines for improved engineering design of general aviation crashworthiness. 710408. Military Application and Experience with Com- posites. David A. Roselius and Havard A. Wood, USAF Flight Dynamics Lab. Advanced composites materials and associated structural technologies have been, and are being, investigated and developed for application to high performance military aircraft. The development of both empennage and wing first generation structural technologies have demonstrated significant weight savings utilizing boron/epoxy compos- ite materials. An aircraft fuselage technology is being developed, having completed one major component; a second generation empennage development effort is fabricating full-scale components, with both efforts using graphite/epoxy composite materials. These two devel- opment efforts continue to show considerable weight savings potential. The successful boron/epoxy structural technology development efforts have resulted in appli- cation of this composite material for production aircraft components, such as stabilizers and full depth honeycomb secondary structure. 1971 SA E Transactions 710409. Reducing Truck and Bus Losses - Neglected Countermeasures. William Haddon, Jr., Insur- ance Institute for Highway Safety. There is no reason why priorities for reducing losses involving trucks and buses must parallel the rank of causes. Moreover, a mix of countermeasures is necessary. Among the neglected issues, drivers' alcohol use in light-truck operation needs attention. Present braking ability of trucks is inadequate, guaranteeing collisions in emergencies in dense traffic streams. All vehicles includ- ing heavy trucks under full load must have the same braking ability. Cargoes must not spill at full-speed impacts, guard rails must be designed to work with trucks, and buses must package passengers safely to the great extent scientifically known to be possible. 710411. The Role of Military Aviation Greases in Sub- sonic Commercial Airplane Design. Douglas C. Sullivan, The Boeing Co. The Boeing Co. subsonic commerical airplane design practice is to use military specification greases as preferred lubricants. This standardization practice originated with the 707 prototype, and has been continued throughout design and construction stages of all commercial jet 123</page><page sequence="59">710412-710423 124 models. Based on service experience and supplementary testing, this approach has proven economical and tech- nically beneficial to the airlines. Preferred military specifications and brief details of supplementary tests are discussed. 710412. ATA Airline Industry Survey of Airports. Robert W. Maniré, Air Transport Association of Amer- ica. Since the introduction of turbojet passenger aircraft in 1959, the FAA, the airport operators, and the airlines have worked to establish a program to identify the operational safety and performance standards for this new aircraft. Through the offices of the Air Transport Association, the airlines have developed and published the Airline Industry Survey of Airports to aid the FAA in evaluating a sponsor's request for federal aid for airport development. There have been some problems in securing federal funds for airport improvement, but with a properly administered trust fund, airport development can become a reality. 710413. Airport Certification. Clyde W. Pace, Jr., Federal Aviation Administration. This paper provides information on the Airport Certi- fication Program, including the certification/safety in- spection procedures and a list of minimum safety standards that will be contained in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Any additions or modifications to the minimum safety standards will be updated by the author at the May 10, 1972 SAE Meeting. 710414. The National Airport System Plan - Its History and Its Potential. Robert F. Bacon and Elliott B. Perrett, Jr., Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration has, as one of its principal tasks in the field of airport planning, the preparation of a National Airport System Plan to define the scope and timing of needed airport development throughout the country. This process, while refined as to extent and substance by the Airport and Airway Devel- opment Act of 1970, is essentially the result of a long history of evolution from the earliest days of the federal interest in airports. That evolution is traced in this paper to provide an understanding of the current and potential influence of airport system planning in identifying the extent of landing facilities needed to meet the increasingly critical needs of air transportation in this nation. 710415. Signage and Directional Guidance for Aircraft Passengers - A Total Concept. Walter R. Lavalli and John R. Berry, Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Associates, Inc. This paper discusses airport signs and directional gui- dance for aircraft passengers. Size of signs, type and type size, sign color, location of interior and exterior signs are considered from the passenger's point of view, while economy of design and flexibility, durability and main- tenance are considered from the airport's point of view. 710418. Expansibility and Economy of Terminal Struc- tures. Jack D. Downey, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport Board. The airport terminal building, to be a useful tool over many years, must have a high degree of flexibility. In planning terminal structures, we must recognize that economy and expansibility are co-requirements and must be mutually involved. Four dimensions of terminal planning and construction should be considered. In addition to the usual dimensions of length, height, and width, time is an equally important component. The extensive use of dimensional planning can make a facility longlived. 710419. Development Progress of New Transport Engines - JT9D. G. P. Adamson, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The means by which Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft is bringing about improvements in its JT9D engine are described. The JT9D engine, having accumulated 1V2 years of commer- cial service, benefits both from a product improvement effort aimed at developing fixes for current operating problems and from development work on advanced JT9D models designed to power future transport aircraft. An extended comparison between the current JT9D-3A engine and the first advanced JT9D (the JT9D-7) illustrates the product improvement process in detail. 710421. Development Progress on CF6 Engines. B. H. Rowe, General Electric Co. The development of commercial engines requires ade- quate testing to assure reliable low cost operation in service. Problems experienced as a result of severe endurance testing, and the design changes which solved these problems, are described in detail. Adequate per- formance margin is essential to allow concentrated efforts in the area of reliability and long life. 710422. Olympus 593 for Concorde Updating of Devel- opment Position. M. H. Beanland, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. The development program on the Olympus 593 pure jet twin shaft engine has been in existence about 5l/2 years. Throughout the program a policy of matching engine rating to aircraft requirements has been adopted. All engine standards have been checked out by extensive bench endurance testing. Performance requirements have been confirmed by testing in altitude cells and by subsonic flight. 710423. The Economics of Subsonic Transport Airplane Design, Evaluation and Operation. Donald D. Hufford, James A. Ross and Kenneth W. Hoefs, The Boeing Co. The interactive and cyclical design, evaluation, and</page><page sequence="60">710425-710429 operational system that conceives transport airplanes is described. Some economic consequences of preliminary design variable choices are displayed, followed by an inspection of the 1967 ATA method and actual direct operating costs. Use and misuses of the formula costs, as compared to actual cost levels, are considered. Finally, the impact of airplane choice on airline profitability is examined. It is seen that the profit consequences are great enough to require careful attention to economic trades in every step of the design, evaluation, and operational process. 710425. The MAC MADAR System: An AIDS Model for Commercial Airlines. George C. Curtis and Charles F. Elgin, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The growing body of technology relative to maintenance monitoring provides substantial evidence that on-con- dition maintenance will be a reality in the foreseeable future. The Military Airlift Command's MADAR (Mal- function, Detection, Analysis, and Recording) System is emerging as the "missing link" which has heretofore retarded progress toward attainment of this increasingly- important goal. The key issue is real time response. Monitoring-system reliability, accuracy, and repeatibility are all of little consequence if the system output is not timely enough to assist the maintenance function. Recent use of communications links by some airlines to transmit recorded data to a centrally-based computer has reduced the time span between data generation and its availability for use. Nevertheless, the response time is still estimated to be somewhere between 5 and 24 hr. The best response time (5 hr) exceeds the time available for turnaround maintenance by a factor of five, and is ten times longer than the time allotted for enroute maintenance. Thus the most efficient of the "recorder-type" AIDS finds value chiefly in the domain of long-term trend analysis. Placing the data-processing decision-making functions aboard the aircraft effectively reduced the response time to zero. The real-time awareness of aircraft condition thereby afforded expands the AIDS domain to include short-term main- tenance situations, a capability essential to realization of true on-condition maintenance. 710426. Development of the Lockheed L-1011's Flying Stabilizer. C. A. Whitmore, Lockheed-California Co. Longitudinal control on the Lockheed L- 1011 is provided by a flying stabilizer. This is the first time such an approach has been used on a United States commercial jet transport. This paper presents the reasons for the choice of longitudinal control systems, and describes the mecha- nization of the control system with particular emphasis on how it meets Lockheed's safety standards and the Federal Airworthiness Requirements. The status of the ground and flight development tests is discussed. 710427. Beryllium Brake Experience on the C-5A Air- plane. Robert D. Gilson, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The critical design weight environment necessary to optimize load-carrying efficiency of the C-5A was such that breakthroughs in technology were needed. One such breakthrough was beryllium brakes. From the discovery of beryllium in 1798 its advan- tages, as well as its disadvantages, were well known. These are discussed to indicate why beryllium was chosen as the brake heat sink material for the design configuration evolved. A review of current C-5A data is presented, including flight test experience, as well as expected life projection from limited normal operational experience. The re-use of beryllium elements, and cost effectiveness are also discussed. A consideration of the future use of beryllium is indicated, with the conclusion that it will become commonplace in the next decade. 1971 SA E Transactions 710428. Study of Visible Exhaust Smoke from Aircraft Jet Engines. John Stockham and Howard Betz, IIT Research Institute. The objective of this study was to relate the visibility of inflight jet exhaust to the AIA smoke number. A method based on photographic photometry was developed for measuring the optical density of smoke plumes. This method was related to visibility and to the smoke number through transmissometer measurements and visibility theory. A portable transmissometer, capable of operating over a wide range of optical path lengths and under varying ambient light conditions, was fabricated for use on this study. The mathematical expression relating the transmission measurements to the smoke number was derived. Liminal visibility requirements of smoke trails, developed from light scattering theory, correlated with actual visual observations and the transmissometer and photometry measurements. Test results, with the engines investigated, indicate that AIA smoke numbers below 23 were associated with invisible exhaust plumes. Samples of the exhaust smoke showed the particles to be composed of lacy agglomerates. At the nozzle, the geometric median partical diameter was 0.052 jum. At a distance of 10 nozzle diameters the geometric median particle diameter was 0.13 /xm at cruise condition. 1971 SA E Transactions 710429. Jet Aircraft Emissions and Air Quality in the Vicinity of the Los Angeles International Airport. Eloy R. Lozano, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and Ralph E. George, Los Angeles Pollution Control District. A summary is presented of the results of a comprehensive air pollution study conducted by the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District (LACAPCD) under con- tract with the Air Pollution Control Office of the Environmental Protection Agency. Included in the data obtained are the results of exhaust testing, emission estimates of aircraft and airport ground operations, 125</page><page sequence="61">710431 - 710436 126 measurements of the atmosphere in the immediate environs of the airport, and passenger cabin measure- ments. The data indicate that the CO emissions from airport ground operations exceed levels generally attrib- uted to commercial jet aircraft. Passenger cabin CO measurements during startup and taxiing procedures indicate average levels of 2-7 ppm. Air quality levels in the residential areas around the airport indicate average 6 hr CO concentrations of 3-11 ppm. 1971 SAE Transactions 710431. FAA Appraisal of Aircraft Design for Main- tainability. James E. Dougherty, Federal Avia- tion Administration. This paper outlines an appraisal of aircraft design for maintainability as viewed by the Federal Aviation Administration. The basis for FAA's authority in the Act is set forth. The extent of the applicable requirements now in the Federal Air Regulations is traced. Maintenance concepts and examples of adverse airworthiness situations are described. Controls and procedures employed by FAA to account for maintainability of new designs, including MSG-2, are explained. Maintainability guidelines appli- cable to new designs are advanced. 710432. One Operator's Look at Maintainability. William A. Keeler, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. Spiraling commercial airplane equipment costs will not tolerate operational inefficiency. The airline operator must keep his departure gates well-stocked with mechan- ically sound equipment if he is to realize a reasonable return on his investment. The role of maintainability in assuring equipment readiness is reviewed from the viewpoint of one airline operator, and six basic keys to good airplane equipment maintainability are discussed. 710433. Development and Service Experience of the PT6A Reduction Gearbox. A. W. Stewart and D. Hollingworth, United Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. This paper details PT6 reduction gearbox reliability problems as revealed by development testing and regular service. Initial bench tests showed that despite attempts to design within the state-of-the-art, the application was such as to require an extension of contemporary knowledge of gear design. Cavitation erosion of the planet gear bushings gave rise to some anxiety and excessive wear of coupling splines necessitated a redesign. These and other minor problems were largely resolved before certification and delivery of the first production units. Except for an incident with units operating in Arctic conditions, no significant reliability problems have oc- curred in regular service. Some wear problems have been corrected with subsequent benefit to overhaul costs but most complaints have been generated by seepage from the propeller shaft oil seal. This was not an operational hazard. Models in current production are little different from the initial production standard, although some have been certified for maximum powers nearly 50% greater than the first units and the minimum approved time between overhauls, for operation in the United States, is now 3000 hr. 710434. JT9D Development for Airline Operation. G. E. Woodger, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT9D engine is described with respect to the ways in which it has been designed to meet the requirements of airline operators. Chief emphasis is placed on the engine's simplicity of construction, provisions for condition monitoring, and capability for maintenance, along with its improved noise and smoke emission characteristics. Specific maintenance problems and their solutions are presented. 710435. Labyrinth Seal Designs Have Benefitted from Development and Service Experience. J. S. Alford, General Electric Co. If the labyrinth seal designer can first determine the nature, cause, and resolution of previous problems, he can then better judge what to do and how to do it for today's engines. The designer of long-life labyrinth seals is primarily interested in those design features and design criteria which have been substantiated by actual service experience. If the design features or criteria are too recent to have had significant service experience, component or factory engine tests may provide valuable substantiation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss criteria and service experience which support today's designs. 1971 SAE Transactions 710436. Economic Impact of Maintenance Consortia. E. C. Gilbert, Jr., American Airlines, Inc. The term "maintenance consortia" is used to indicate efforts in support of the daily operational requirements of airplanes within commercial aviation. These kinds of combined efforts are not Utopian situations but can be very factual, very real, and very profitable. Early factors working to the disadvantage of combined maintenance support effort were lack of communications, isolation of airplanes to rather small areas due to their slow speeds, difficulty of logistics-much of which resulted from lack of communications, lack of standardization of airplanes, lack of common purpose and understanding among the carriers, lack of common standards and controls, plus many other factors common to an embryonic industry. Early in the game, attempted consortia tended to dilute corporate images by being directly involved with the handling of customers . . . thus destroying the aspects of individual passenger attention. Maintenance support removed from the marketing front has good chances for success. The early Allison arrangement for unit exchange of engines in support of the Lockheed Electra was successful. The Trans World/ American cross-servicing of two engines was the first such arrangement between major airlines. Initial joint efforts in</page><page sequence="62">710437-710443 the 747 and those foreseen with the DC- 10 and 1011 airplanes, which are greatly enhanced by more standard configurations, ease of inspection, understood maintain- ability concepts ... are all conducive to maintenance combines. Projected arrangements now indicate clearly that much can be done to obtain maximum utilization of real estate, facilities, warehousing, parts pooling, cross- servicing, etc. These concepts are well-understood, estab- lished, and progress is being made. 710437. New Developments in Product Support. H. Bayer, Douglas Aircraft Co.; and J. Woodworth, National Airlines. The use of maintenance cost data can be successfully employed as a design constraint for product support. This paper summarizes the process used in translating quan- titative maintenance cost requirements into specific design criteria. It describes the airline operator's use of such data and how he then passes cost objectives on to the aircraft manufacturer. The various steps used in the design process are described from a manufacturer's standpoint. Examples are given to show the relationship of cost to resulting maintainability improvements. Finally, the air- line operator's viewpoint is presented which calls for more stringent compliance with previously determined main- tenance concepts and procedures. The paper closes with a look at future program requirements. 710438. Microbiological Contamination of Aircraft Fuel Tanks - Airframe Considerations. J. A. Scott, British Aircraft Corporation, Ltd. Extensive research and development has removed the major causes of microbiological corrosion of aircraft fuel tanks. However, a problem still exists, since costly preventive measures are sometimes required; the reasons for the present situation are discussed in detail. Diffi- culties that arise in laboratory testing are described and the need for realistic test conditions and interpretation of results is stressed. Research and development work in the United Kingdom is summarized, and it is suggested that further work is required into some aspects of the problem. 710439. Electrical and Physical Nature of Microbial Membranes Implicated in Aircraft Fuel Quantity Probe Malfunction. W. B. Engel and R. M. Owen, Douglas Aircraft Co. Microorganisms contaminating aircraft turbine fuels are known to cause severe corrosion in jet aircraft integral fuel tanks. Microbial deposits on fuel quantity capacitance probes are also suspected of causing malfunction of these probes. To determine how microbial contamination can cause quantity probe malfunction, an artificial environ- ment conducive to the rapid growth of microbial mem- branes was developed. Studies were conducted on mem- branes grown in this environment to determine their electrical conductive properties showing that the mem- branes in their natural state exhibited a low resistance, thus indicating that they were sufficiently conductive to cause fuel quantity probe malfunction. These results were confirmed by placing laboratory- grown membranes at different locations on a fuel quantity probe and measuring changes in capacitance and resis- tance of the probe. 1971 SA E Transactions 710440. Salt Driers Assure Really Dry Fuel to Aircraft. H. R. Porter and G. R. Deits, Standard Oil Co. of California; J. A. Bert and B. C. Anderson, Chevron Research Co. Salt driers installed in an airport jet fuel delivery system reduced the fuel water content below saturation, length- ened filter life, and improved the performance of the downstream system components. Systems must be de- signed and operated to control salt carry-over. The high initial cost of salt driers compared with conventional filter-coalescers may be justified by low operation cost, improved microbial control, and customer satisfaction. Salt driers have a place in airport fuel treating. 710441. From Automatic Landing to Category III. Will- iam Russell, Air Transport Association of Amer- ica. Progress toward full all weather landing operation of transport aircraft is evaluated. Experience with Category II instrument approach operations in actual weather is reviewed. The disparity between the lagging implemen- tation of ground facilities in the United States, and the extensive implementation of costly Category II airborne equipment is discussed. Actions needed to provide viable Category Ilia operations are examined, including discussion of pro- cedures to aid in insuring integrity, and the need for implementing Category Ilia facilities in the United States. Implications of the proposed new landing guidance system and of possible independent landing monitors are also examined. Limitations of available weather surveys and a number of economic considerations are pointed out. Aggressive implementation of ground facilities is recom- mended. 710442. CAT IPs Role in Low Minimums. R. H. Nolte- meier, Federal Aviation Administration. This paper discusses the present status of CAT II operations and some of the considerations that have been taken into account in reaching this stage. There is a brief discussion of training, flight procedures, and equipment evaluated during the development of CAT II operations. 710443. Development Testing of the L-1011 Independent Landing Monitor. Gerald Holliday and John A. Gorham, Lockheed-California Co. A new, completely independent monitor (capable of operation through Category IIIc weather condition) for use with automatic landing systems, is undergoing 127</page><page sequence="63">710444-710448 v 128 development by Lockheed for possible use in L-1011 aircraft. Following intensive analysis, a Ka band airborne radar was selected to provide pilot confidence through inde- pendent monitoring of the L-1011 (1) dual-dual, fail operative, automatic landing system's performance. Lockheed's airborne flying test bed (CV-240) program has so far provided evidence that the Independent Landing Monitor concept has a definite future in commercial automatic landing applications under reduced visibilities. Visual enhancement would improve the ac- ceptability of near zero-zero operation and consequently reduce the number of unnecessary go-arounds. 1971 SAE Transactions 710444. Design Criteria for Selection of Aircraft Electric Power Generation and Distribution Systems. C. H. Lee, AiResearch Manufacturing Company. Conventional aircraft use constant-speed drive to generate constant-frequency 400-Hz power of relatively good quality and distribute it at 115/200 V. A detailed study revealed that this power type is not the optimal choice for present and future aircraft applications. This paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of various generation and distribution systems and the factors to be considered in selecting an electric power system. For medium and large size STOL aircraft, it appears that variable-frequency generation and high-voltage d-c dis- tribution with secondary square wave a-c distribution may be superior to the conventional system. 1971 SAE Transactions 710445. Optimization of Military VTOL Secondary Pow- er Systems. Dennis Stein, The Boeing Co.; and Jules Vichness, U. S. Army. Military VTOL/VSTOL aircraft are required to operate in areas where it is impractical to provide ground support equipment to supply types of power needed for system checkout, emergency and standby power, and main engine starting. To provide this capability, the Secondary Power System must be considered on an integrated basis as a major aircraft subsystem which incorporates an auxiliary power unit (APU) that will provide an alternate source of power, in flight and on the ground, for aircraft hydraulics, pneumatic drivers, APU starting, environmental control, main engine starting, electrical power generation, power transfer to accessory gearbox for shaftdriven accessories, plus the power distribution system to interconnect these components. This paper discusses the application of this integrated concept and the associate analyses of operating char- acteristics of major components. Appropriate interface and compatibility with the total air vehicle is illustrated. Significant parameters such as power, weight, efficiencies, produce assurance characteristics, etc., are compared. 710446. Powered Wheels - A Concept for Parking and Taxiing of Commercial Transport Airplanes. B. C. Hainline, B. K. Sellereite and K. V. Swanke, The Boeing Co. The concept of powered wheels as applied here is the propelling of an airplane on the ground by direct traction of landing gear wheels using onboard power and under direct control of the pilot. This concept suggests an improvement in economic and ecologie factors associated with ground operation of commercial transport airplanes. For the concept to be economically feasible, penalties for addition of airborne equipment must be overbalanced by savings in fuel, engine operating time, ground equipment, ground personnel, and terminal space and by increased airplane productivity. The use of direct wheel traction can improve the airport and terminal environment by reduc- ing air pollution, jet blast, and noise from main propulsion engines during taxi and parking. This paper is a preliminary look at requirements, configuration, and trades that require further investigation to establish the role of powered wheels in future air transportation. 1971 SAE Transactions 710447. Design Integration - The Key to Effective Engine Condition Monitoring. K. B. Kochański and D. W. Leiby, General Electric Co. As aircraft increase in size and required capital invest- ment, the incentives for development and application of techniques and methods for optimizing the availability of the aircraft become increasingly attractive. Currently, a family of techniques, which can be broadly defined as engine condition monitoring, are being applied to reduce the downtime assignable to the aircraft power plant. The mechanical health of the engine is assessed through such techniques as parameter monitoring, vibration analysis, oil monitoring, borescope inspection, and radiography to provide problem detection, isolation, and trend monitor- ing. The effectiveness of a condition monitoring system depends upon the realization of a compatible interface between the basic engine design and installation, and the monitoring system, as well as the application of effective diagnostic logic to the acquired data. The purpose of this paper is to examine the design interface requirements for selected monitoring techniques and the analytical meth- ods for data interpretation, and to recommend the design features needed to enhance the monitoring capabilities to approach the optimum overall condition monitoring system. 710448. Electronic Engine Condition Analysis System. H. J. Moses, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. A new systems approach has been developed and applied to achieve the inspection, diagnosis, and prognosis of gas turbine engine health by electronic means. The approach combines the power of the special purpose digital computer together with advanced engine fault isolation techniques to achieve a complete operational and main- tenance interface. System elements are described and</page><page sequence="64">710449-710455 typical examples discussed. Practical applications of the system to several engine models have been made with favorable results. 710449. Contemporary Approach to Commercial Power- plant Development. G. W. Kleinert, General Electric Co. Vital to the success of the turbine powered airplane is the degree to which the engine manufacturer can develop the entire powerplant to its fullest maturity early in the life of the airplane system. With increasing demands for shorter powerplant development cycles, to meet the needs of the shorter airframe development cycle, new techniques and methods are being employed to accelerate the devel- opment of contemporary powerplants. Equally important to the improved development techniques and methods is the ability to establish and monitor the technical progress early in the powerplant development program. This paper will describe the approach taken in the development of the CF6 family of engines, including techniques established to monitor technical progress. 710450. Propulsion Testing from the Aircraft Manufac- turers' Point of View. W. A. Reinhart, The Boeing Co. In developing a modern commercial aircraft, the airframe and engine manufacturers work as a team to develop the propulsion system and verify the high standards of safety, reliability, and performance the airlines and the public expect. An extremely important part of this undertaking is the testing of the propulsion system components and finally the entire system in realistic simulated operating conditions before the airplane goes into service. With each new airplane system, the design require- ments tend to become more demanding and the devel- opment and proof testing more exacting to assure that the test simulation of the critical operating environment is correct and that the instrumentation and data systems are adequate to accurately and quickly obtain the required information. Careful judgement and expert ingenuity are required to obtain the required data in a timely and cost-effective manner so as to minimize the test time required. An overview is provided of the airframe manufacturers' viewpoint in the development testing which leads to a new aircraft, including scale model, ground, and flight testing. Major areas which are becoming more critical with each generation of aircraft are discussed in more detail; noise reduction and inlet-engine-exhaust system compat- ibility being two. Examples of problems which have been faced in recent subsonic airplanes and some of particular interest in advanced aircraft, such as the SST, are discussed. Specific simulation and data acquisition problems, test techniques, and examples of the types of data which are currently used are presented. Finally, the improvements which will be required for more advanced aircraft systems are discussed. 710451. Powerplant Testing from an Operator's Per- spective. R. E. Totman, United Air Lines, Inc. The major emphasis of airline engine performance testing can be summarized by three precepts: 1 . Avoid release of engines which will be maintenance problems, 2. Prevent rejection of engines which will operate satisfactorily until the next scheduled removal, and 3. Reduce testing costs. This paper will present the methods used by United Air Lines to most profitably assign relative weights to the three guidelines. Further, in a related but somewhat diverse section, progress with an automated test cell data acquisition system will be presented. 710452. The Costs/Reliability Relationships of Devel- opment Testing and Demonstration. Kirk G. Rummel and Robert B. Aronson, The Boeing Co. This paper explores the relationships between the costs of developmental testing and the derived benefits in relia- bility. The analysis quantifies this relationship for the components of the dynamic system of a specific future helicopter. Distinctions are drawn between test costs related to reliability requirements and those that are not related. Emphasis is placed on the decision making process that is required when formal reliability and maintainability (R&amp;M) demonstration tests are imposed. The statistical aspects of demonstration tests are exam- ined and related to the program manager's informational requirements. 710454. Analysis of Transmission Failure Modes. C. W. Bowen, Bell Helicopter Co. This paper presents a synopsis of an extensive failure mode investigation and analysis of Bell UH-1 and Vertol CH-47 transmissions. Correlation of these observed field experiences with conventional design stress analysis techniques and preliminary bench test data is presented. Lubrication states as defined by elastohydrodynamic film thickness calculations are shown to offer explanation for the existence of many failure modes which are not predicted by conventional analyses. Simple statistical methods for failure data analysis are employed as an aid to assessing relative gain in reliability afforded through correction of dominant failure modes. The premise is advanced that the key to successful design of advanced helicopter power transmissions featuring significant in- creases in operational reliability may be found in the application of these lessons. 1971 SA E Transactions 710455. Area Navigation in the ATC Environment. E. E. Glanz, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. Aircraft equipped with computerized Area Navigation 129</page><page sequence="65">710456-710460 130 Systems have created the need for an entirely new air traffic control environment. This paper will highlight problems encountered as the ATC system begins its evolution toward area navigation, and will suggest operational techniques favorable to a total area navigation ATC environment. Conventional interfaces are no longer useful. Inde- pendent systems (computer, controller, pilot, route struc- ture, and aircraft) meet in the cockpit, but satisfactory communications have not been established. Pilot reaction indicates that the information is not now properly presented in the cockpit. Attempts to solve these interface problems have indicated that the solution lies in comprehensive software programs and clear situation displays for the pilot. 710456. Requirements, Performance and Integration of Modern Navigation Aids. A. B. Winick and D. M. Brandewie, Federal Aviation Administra- tion. The need to improve the efficiency and capacity of the Air Traffic Control and Navigation System has placed greater emphasis on the functional integration of sub-systems which have been treated independently in the past. This paper presents results of limited test programs designed to explore the relationship of terminal area navigation and the air traffic control system, and to show the benefits of an optimum combination of both functions. The need for further analysis is indicated with respect to carrying out the third generation system design postulated by the DOT Air Traffic Control Advisory Committee. It is concluded that functional integration of ATC and navigation in the terminal area presents the greatest challenge. In other areas, such as enroute, the availability of new, integrated avionics systems provides an expanded operational ca- pability. 710457. Area Navigation Systems and Displays. Frank F. Wright and William R. Beckman, Lockheed- California Co.; and T. J. Newman, AMBAC Industries, Inc. Area Navigation Systems (RNAV) coupled with appro- priate air traffic control techniques, promise to improve the movement of aircraft within the National Airspace System (NAS). These systems are based upon use of the NAS ground radio navigation aids by the airborne navigation receivers, and other sensors available in today's aircraft. The evolution and product development of airborne equipment for this purpose have been guided by airline and FAA operational needs. The airline industry through its Air Transport Association (ATA) and Airline Elec- tronic Engineering Committees (AEEC) are standardizing the requirements for three classes of equipment. These are Mark I RNAV - simple yet requiring considerable pilot manual operation. The Mark II RNAV - virtually au- tomatic with new cathode-ray-tube multifunction/navi- gation displays for the pilot; and the Mark III (Mark 13) RNAV - based upon use of the self-contained inertial navigation systems presently installed on today's large jets. Airline experimental programs have provided insight into the need for certain pilot workload reduction features and capabilities. The airframe and avionic equipment manufacturer are following these guidelines in the devel- opment and application of these systems in the next generation wide body jets, soon to enter airline service. This paper presents descriptions of the different classes of RNAV equipment along with operational advantages of the pilot displays. 1971 SA E Transactions 710458. INS Projections and Improvements Capabilities in the Future. Christopher L. Bearden, American Airlines, Inc. ARINC 561 Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) have received wide acceptance in the Commercial Air Trans- port Industry. Many innovative improvements to these systems have been developed in recent years. Increased functional capability is planned for the near future such as vertical navigation and accuracy improvement using radio navigation aids. 710459. Thermal Fatigue Testing of Simulated Turbine Blades. D. A. Spera, F. D. Calfo and P. T. Bizon, NASA Lewis Research Center. Simulated turbine blades were subjected to transient and steady-state heating and spanwise loading in a Mach 1 burner rig. Leading-edge cracks were produced which were similar to thermal-fatigue cracks observed during engine service. Crack initiation and propagation data were obtained for a variety of test conditions. The simulated turbine blades consisted of coated and uncoated IN 100 and B 1900 cambered airfoils with grips for application of spanwise load to simulate centrifugal stress. Test variables were blade temperature, spanwise load, and steady-state (hold) time. The Mach 1 gas velocity substantially reduced conventional creep rupture life. This caused a substantial reduction in thermal fatigue life. Coating effectiveness was below that for low velocity tests. 710460. Coated Columbium for Gas Turbine Engine Application. J. F. Holloway, H. A. Hauser and E. F. Bradley, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. High temperature strength and high thermal conductivity make columbium an attractive candidate for gas turbine engine components despite poor oxidation resistance relative to superalloys. The creep strengths of existing columbium alloys are adequate for burner and turbine vane applications up to metal temperatures of 2200-2400 F with considerably reduced cooling. The high conduc- tivity and ductility of columbium along with low modulus and low thermal expansion coefficient produce very high resistance to thermal fatigue. In addition, the silicide</page><page sequence="66">710461-710468 coating technology has advanced to the point that multi-hundred hour lives at 2200-2400 F for coated columbium components are now attainable. The fabrica- bility of air cooled turbine vanes from welded B-66 columbium alloy sheet has been demonstrated, including the coatability of air cooling passages with a slurry silicide. These vanes have run in a turbine development engine for 100 hr of steady state and cyclic operation at metal temperatures in excess of 2000 F. Coated colum- bium sheet alloys are also being evaluated for burner application with encouraging results. For example, ther- mal fatigue lives beyond 14,000 cycles to 2400 F have been measured, compared to less than 3000 cycles to 1800 F for nickel-base alloys including TD Nickel. A film- cooled burner liner of FS-85 columbium alloy sheet material coated with the Sylvania SiCrFe slurry coating has been fabricated and will be rig- and engine-tested. The applicability of columbium to turbine vanes has recently been enhanced by the demonstration of an investment cast columbium vane shape. 710461. Why Maximum Temperature? M. E. Naylor, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp.; and J. L. Byers, Naval Air Systems Command. This paper develops the definition of a maximum temperature engine (MTE) and the particular freedom that this capability will provide to propulsion systems of some future aircraft. The MTE concept is presented not as a panacea for all propulsion ills but, properly applied to aircraft applications that can utilize its specific capabil- ities, as holding the promise of significant improvements in aircraft performance levels. An overview of some of these potential benefits is given by a comparison of one MTE with current development state-of-the-art engines and an indication of the time that will be required to demonstrate the payoffs and develop a MTE to the state of full utility is delineated. 710462. High Temperature Turbine Design Considera- tions. S. N. Suciu, General Electric Co. The major technological developments which have made possible the trend towards higher temperatures in modern aircraft gas turbine engines are discussed. The relative importance of manufacturing processes, material devel- opments, cooling techniques, analytical design procedures, rupture and cyclic life considerations, and aerodynamic and mechanical design improvements are discussed along with illustrative examples and technical data. The need for a balanced design approach is stressed, and examples are given where trade-offs can be made. It is noted that the advances in aircraft engines during the last 10 years have been based on the evolution of sound engineering principles, extensive component and engine development, and careful consideration of the operational requirements rather than a tremendous breakthrough or revolutionary concept in any one area. 710464. The Future of STOL. Richard D. FitzSimmons and William E. Thurman, National Aeronautics and Space Council. The pace of a complete STOL system implementation may well be determined by the amount and character of federal government involvement. If the federal govern- ment does become the prime motivator of a national STOL program, then agencies with established aircraft, airport, and airways R&amp;D activities, especially the Department of Transportation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Defense, should be expected to be the cutting edge of this STOL development. Therefore, the role the agencies now see for themselves becomes vitally important to anyone trying to define a STOL development timetable. This paper discusses individual DOT, NASA, and DOD STOL roles and missions including the supporting rationale, that will allow the agencies to collectively address STOL systems implementation and create an environment in which the free enterprise system can assume its rightful role and provide a profitable, safe, environmentally satisfactory new air transportation service that is truly responsive to the desires of the public. 710465. Comparison of STOL Design Criteria for Com- mercial and Military Transport Aircraft. Jesse C. Peaslee, The Boeing Co. The characteristics of STOL transport aircraft designed for military missions resemble those developed for commercial air transport. A military aircraft with ap- proximately 30,000-lb payload capacity correlates reason- ably well with 120-150 passenger commercial aircraft. When reasonable margins of safety are applied to takeoff and landing criteria, the military transport designed for 2000-ft landing and takeoff distances could probably be certified at about the same landing and takeoff distances for civil use. However, many STOL military design details are not defined well enough to assure that similar commercial aircraft would be economical in airline use. Conversely, the criteria for acceptable levels of noise for commercial STOL aircraft might result in a less-than- optimum aircraft for military service. 710468. Military/Commercial STOL Transport Com- monality. Harold F. Kleckner, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Military and commercial turbofan STOL transport work at the Douglas Aircraft Co. during the past four years has led to the consideration of commonality between the USAF Medium STOL Transport and a short-range, medium-sized commercial STOL transport. General requirements for the two airplanes appear to be similar and include a cruise speed of Mach 0.75-0.80 for a 500-n. mile range after takeoff from a 2000-ft airstrip. Both require a wide body; and the payload, furnishing, and equipment yield comparable STOL take- off weights. Both can be designed with a high wing, a moderate wing loading, and the same STOL lifting 131</page><page sequence="67">710469-710475 132 concept. A common engine size appears feasible, and basic engine characteristics such as bypass ratio need not be different. Results of a preliminary commonality study are presented in which several cases with varying degrees of commonality are evaluated in terms of costs. The cost benefits of shared development and production were found to outweigh the penalties related to design com- promises, resulting in lower costs for both military and commercial operators. 710469. STOL Engine Systems and Sensitivity Factors. Joel Godston, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. The purpose of this paper is to list the possible competitive engine systems for the STOL aircraft likely to be operational in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The impor- tance of integrating the engine and airframe during the early design phase of the STOL aircraft system will be outlined. A description of typical augmented wing and blown flap engine concepts under investigation, and the system trade factors affecting aircraft gross weight and potential return on investment will be presented. System trade factors including noise, weight, performance, and cost will be evaluated to provide an overall view of the compromises that are, or must be, made in order that the STOL aircraft engine system be a viable commercial product. The available and required engine technologies are reviewed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710470. Prop-Fan - A High Thrust, Low Noise Propul- sor. George Rosen, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. The Prop-Fan is introduced as a new propulsor type, intermediate between ducted propellers and low bypass fans. Compared to today's fan engines, it offers approx- imately twice the takeoff thrust/hp at half the tip speed and consequently much reduced noise level. Furthermore, its controllable pitch feature provides more effective reverse thrust at about one-fourth the weight of current flow reversers. Prop-Fan characteristics are particularly well matched to the propulsion requirements of advanced STOL transport aircraft. Highlighted is the uniquely low noise signature of the Prop-Fan. This now permits the design of medium-to-long range STOL transports of high-productivity which will meet the stringent noise level limits for STOL-ports. This paper describes the devel- opment status of the Prop-Fan, examines potential aircraft installation arrangements, and presents some representative STOL transport effectiveness comparisons. 1971 SAE Transactions 710471. Lift Ratings of V/STOL Propulsion Units. W. W. Thomas and E. G. Smith, General Electric Co. Lift ratings of V/STOL propulsion units are identified based on the requirements of the aircraft system. Typical V/STOL handling criteria are applied in the derivation of the lift rating method. Analytical techniques are presented for the evaluation of contributing factors associated with both the aircraft and propulsion system characteristics. Two typical aircraft systems are used to determine representative levels of lift ratings for the propulsion units. 710472. Development of an Individualized Ground Train- ing Program for DC-10 Flight Crews. W. P. Moran, American Airlines. In an effort to reduce flight crews ground training time, while at the same time maximizing learning efficiency, American Airlines is making use of specialized, indi- vidualized, programmed instruction, with increased em- phasis on the use of "hands-on" training equipment, to transition experienced crewmen to the DC-10 airplane. This paper explains the concept of identifying the specific operating requirements unique to this airplane and the development of a program to train crewmen to proficient- ly perform these operating requirements. It also covers briefly the principal training hardware developed to support this program. 710473. Boeing 747 Training Developments and Imple- mentation. B. M. Tate, Trans World Airlines. A training program for crew members of TWA's 747 is described. The paper begins with the formulation of general policies and their translation into a ground training program, and continues with descriptions of the classroom, inertial navigation system, and cockpit train- ers. The details of the training program are presented, as are a description of the TWA 747 simulator and discussion of anticipated problems. 710474. Flight Crew Training - A Total Concept, T. J. Layne and P. M. Morton, The Boeing Co. To serve the requirements of the operational environment of modern jet aircraft, the flight crew training program should be kept as simple as possible and be consistent with the total information system for aircraft operation of which it is a part. Systematic tools are described which assist the course developer in optimizing the implemen- tation of Specific Behavioral Objectives, allocating learn- ing elements to the most cost effective learning envi- ronment, and organizing those learning elements asso- ciated with the classroom environment. Included is a discussion on the management systems applied, the development of a Learning Task Analysis, and a systems approach to course organization. 710475. The Use of Simulation to Promote Safety and Economy in Flying Training. W. P. Moran, American Airlines Flight Academy. The combination of simulation and improved training techniques ensures a safe and economical flying training program. In a 5-yr period, American Airlines has reduced airplane training and flight check hours by more than 75%. There are strong indications that, for qualified airline</page><page sequence="68">710476-710484 crewmen, a goal of total simulation for all training and flight checks will become a reality. 710476. Assessment of New Training Systems as Sub- stitutes for Airborne Training. J. A. Ferrarese, Federal Aviation Administration. The purpose of this paper is to review progress in the development of simulators as a substitute for airborne training and the evolution of the Federal Aviation Rules, which have authorized expanded use of these devices. The paper discusses limitations of current simulators, areas where further development is needed, and also what we feel the future of simulators will be. 710477. What's New on the Training Horizon. David O. Andersen and William V. Hagin, Air Force Human Resources Lab. Jet flying training is costly and takes a long time. Flying training has always been essentially a "learn by do" operation. This paper describes new training technologies. It documents the potential of these technologies, and simple and complex ground trainers for vastly improving both the quality and efficiency of pilot training. 710478. A New Approach to Flight Crew Training. H. H. Shumway, Lockheed-California Co. A flight crew training program was developed for the L-1011 Trijet utilizing a systems approach similar to that used to develop aircraft. This paper describes a ground school program that features automated instruction taught in a "Cockpit Classroom." Training material is pro- grammed and presented by an audio visual machine. The emphasis of this approach is "Learning by Doing." Training on flight maneuvers will be accomplished in the simulator. A simulator development plan is described to achieve this objective. Flight training is the final examination. Finally, a training plan is presented that indicates that an overlap of ground school and simulator training can increase efficiency. This training plan shows the estimated division of time between ground school, simulator, and flight training for an average trainee. 710479. Airline Pilots View of 747 Training. Charles T. Green, Delta Air Lines, Inc. This paper compares two different types of training used in airline pilot training. The old approach used with early piston aircraft and the first generation of jet aircraft, with a new concept of training introduced with the Boeing 747. The approach to training is called the Specific Behavioral Objective (SBO) concept. This paper is not technical in nature but the views of one airline pilot. 710480. An Innovative Instrument Flight Training Pro- gram. Paul W. Caro, Human Resources Re- search Organization. An innovative flight training program, its development, and initial administration are described. The program involves use of a commercially available training device in a twin-engine transition and instrument training course. Principal features of the training include redefinition of the flight instructor's role, an incentive award system, proficiency-based advancement, full mission training in the device, continuity of training between the device and aircraft, and use of maneuver performance records to control trainee progress. During initial administration of the program by the Army, training flight hour require- ments were reduced approximately 40%. The innovative process as it was applied in the development of the described training program also is discussed. 710481. (SP-365) The ABCs of Engine Exhaust Emis- sions. P. S. Myers, O. A. Uyehara and H. K. Newhall, University of Wisconsin. This paper indicates why certain exhaust constituents from automotive vehicles are considered pollutants, describes the formation of these pollutants in automotive operation, and details techniques being used and consid- ered to control these pollutants. The formation of pollutants - carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, hyrdrocarbons, particulates, and odor - in a variety of engine types and under a variety of conditions, is described in detail. Vehicle emissions are also analyzed for real motor-vehicle operation. 1971 SAE Transactions 710482. (SP-365) Some Instrumentation and Techniques for Measuring Engine Emissions. Richard R. Booy, Outboard Marine Corp. The sources of engine/vehicle emissions are given along with numerous devices for measuring the various types of emissions. A comprehensive explanation is made of the measuring devices more commonly used for engine exhaust emissions. Measurement techniques are discussed including sampling systems, instrument calibration, and test procedures. A modified chassis dynamometer ar- rangement and an experimental device for following a prescribed vehicle-driving cycle are described. 710483. (SP-365) Mechanisms of Pollutant Formation and Control from Automotive Sources. Wayne M. Brehob, Ford Motor Co. There exists a reasonable sound theoretical understanding of the formation mechanisms for gaseous automotive emission. It appears that a cleaned-up internal combus- tion engine, possible with extensive modifications, such as heterogeneous combustion, will be the overall best automotive powerplant for at least the next decade. The paper discusses the sources of automotive pollution, causes of exhaust emission, and methods of emission control. 1971 SAE Transactions 710484. (SP-365) Design Factors that Affect Diesel Emissions. Roger C. Bascom, Louis C. Broering and David E. Wulfhorst, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. 133</page><page sequence="69">710485-710491 134 Although diesels, as a group, are a relatively small source of air pollutants, emissions standards which limit emis- sions from diesels have been adopted by California and the federal government. Test procedures and instrumen- tation for measuring diesel emissions have been developed and an understanding of how engine design parameters affect emissions is evolving. Smoke and carbon monoxide are primarily functions of fuel-air ratio. Smoke is also affected by injection timing, air motion, and fuel spray characteristics. Hydro- carbon emissions are most affected by details of injector design and matching of the spray geometry with the combustion chamber shape. Nitric oxide emissions are controlled by local oxygen availability in regions of high temperature and residence time at the high temperature. Retarded injection timing, rich local fuel-air ratios, lower mixing rates of fuel and air, lower compression ratio, and lower intake air temperature tend to reduce nitric oxide emissions, but may increase smoke. Smoke suppressant additives, water induction, exhaust gas recirculation, and catalytic converters reduce one or more of the emissions, but are less desirable than emissions control through engine modifications. 710485. (SP-365) Motor Gasoline and Automotive Air Pollution. T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co. Until 1970, emission standards and car modifications needed to comply with state regulations had relatively little effect on gasoline quality. Then in 1970, Ford and GMC announced that all or nearly all their 1970 and later model cars would be designed to operate on unleaded gasoline of 91 Research octane number. This paper covers the production capabilities of the petroleum industry, the effect of leaded gasoline on emissions, consumer advan- tages and disadvantages of unleaded gasoline, gasoline volatility, and future gasoline quality. 710486. A New Generation of Integrated Avionic Syn- thesizers. Richard Brubaker and Garth Nash, Motorola Inc. The need to generate signals of a multitude of different frequencies for avionic systems has resulted in complex solutions in the past. With the introduction of certain standard product integrated circuits, frequency synthesis using digital phase locked loop techniques presents a more practical solution. Several different types of servo phase locked loop systems are discussed and a practical design example is given. Results of design examples are presented along with possible applications. 710487. Human Engineering and the Cost-Effectiveness of Air-Safety Devices. Alan E. Diehl, Wichita State University. A simple mathematical model was developed to estimate benefit-to-cost ratios of alternative safety devices. The "Benefit" is the expected decrease in accident losses, while "Cost" includes the expense of the device plus main- tenance and useful load penalty. This model permits the manufacturers and operators to select the most effective items. Realizing that the majority of accidents involve pilot error, the strong and weak points of contemporary cockpit design are described. Several human engineering improvements are proposed. 710488. How Much Motion is Really Needed in Flight Simulators? Edwin Cohen, Link Div., The Singer Co. Although the need for motion on flight simulators used for training is well accepted, there is a wide divergence of opinion on the kind and amount of motion required. This paper reviews the requirements for motion in each of the six degrees of freedom, and suggests the extent of motion desirable in each, as well as ways to exploit given motion system geometry. 710489. New Test Equipment for Transponder and VOR/ILS. Daniel Schacher, Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. New equipment to be described includes a cockpit- operated transponder checker with frequency measuring capability and direct-ready binary and octal display, a digitally-controlled VOR/ILS audio signal generator with resolution of 0.01 deg and 0.001 ddm, and an updating program for HP211A/SG-1A RF signal generators pro- viding zero phase shift, high-precision modulation meas- urements, leveled RF outputs, and single-chassis con- struction. 710490. Information Storage by Holography. J. M. Trum- mel and James H. Goedkin, University of Iowa. The underlying ideas for holography are presented and the nature of the laser beam which is needed for holography is discussed. One example of an arrangement for making holograms is described, and some examples are planned for showing by laser projection onto a screen. From these sample holograms some of the characteristic of holograms are illustrated. These include the fact that small areas of the hologram include information for a complete image, and the fact that different viewpoints are carried by different subareas of the hologram which gives three-dimensional information storage. Finally, appli- cations of holography to shape description, vibration measurement, and small deflection measurement are discussed. 710491. Added Values of Prefinished Hot Dipped Gal- vanized Steel. Hans J. Schneider, Pre-Finish Metals, Inc. Coil coating, which first started in the 1930s, has progressed where coil coating has become the epitome of automation in the finishing field. Its growth can be based on the fact that coil coating adds more in value than it does to cost. This paper gives you a brief look at the process, with emphasis on how each stage of processing contributes to the performance of the coated product.</page><page sequence="70">710497-710506 710497. The Meaning and the Management of Time. Donn W. Hayes, Allis-Chalmers. Predicated on the thesis that time is the most important source of our era, the William James definition of time is accepted as relevant to modern management. Futurity- planning and extended goal-achievement must replace restrictive daily planning to reduce crisis management. Trivia and the committee system account for much wasted time. The controversial biorhythmic theory relating to the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles introduces the plea for introspective analysis to ascertain individual differences in efficient time utilization and productive performance. Three primary managerial resources-man- power,' words (including information), and time-are discussed, the effective utilization of each being para- mount. 710498. Product Complaint Management. N. B. Enevold, International Harvester Co. Starting with the premise that product complaints are valuable to corporate profitability, the author describes an analytical approach to handling such complaints. The investigation of product complaints can help find new ways to design and build better products. The paper covers the aggressive seeking out of grievances before they are uncovered, the establishment of policies on complaint handling, the make-up of the complaint department, the use of computers in complaint management, and the importance of dialogue and people in the complaint handling system. 710499. High Strength Steel for the Earthmoving Industry Material Trends. G. F. Melloy, Bethlehem Steel Corp. Since the introduction of the 100,000 psi minimum yield strength constructional steels in 1953 there has been a definite trend toward the use of thinner sections and leaner, less expensive alloys tailored to provide the properties needed in the thinner sections. In many cases, the leaner alloys can provide satisfactory performance with significant material savings. In other cases, the use of the leaner alloys requires more demanding and expensive processing techniques and the added cost partially or totally offsets the material savings. Although the overall trend is toward leaner alloys there will be a continued demand for steels of varying greater alloy content to satisfy the various performance levels demanded by design and fabrication limitations. 710500. Welding of High Strength Alloy Steels. Omer W. Blodgett, The Lincoln Electric Co. Joining the high strength steels with arc welding demands greater care by all - designer through welder - than normally given mild steel. Proper design and welding procedures will produce crack-free welds that resist failure in service. This paper discusses weld strength allowables for high strength steels under steady and fatigue loading. It also analyzes and relates the effect of controlled heat input (preheat, welding procedure and postheat) to residual stresses, cracking, and distortion. Most of the problems experienced in welding high strength alloy steels can be predicted in advance and eliminated. 1971 SA E Transactions 710501. Use of High Strength Structural Steels. LeRoy A. Grotto, International Harvester Co. The high strength, heat treated weldable steels are very sophisticated steels, but unless the designer specifying these steels is equally sophisticated, he could be in for many unexpected problems. The use of these materials should not be undertaken in a haphazard manner. Each design requirement should be carefully checked against the material property that affects that requirement to be sure the material is suited to the application. 710503. Product Safety - Government and You. Kenneth F. Vander Leest, Caterpillar Tractor Co. How safe are the products we use? Today, people are constantly being alerted to the many dangers which exist in our everyday products, whether it be machinery or toy. Who is to blame and how can the public be protected. Governments, both federal and state, are responding to the public's demand for safer products; however, there is yet much progress to be made by technology to give us products which are safe for our everyday use. 710505. Giant Tires for Gigantic Earthmoving Vehicles. John F. McNabney, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Economics today indicate the need to provide industry with tools of greatly increased capacities to gain the greatest possible output for the least practicable input. Ocean going tankers, railroad cars, airliners, highway trailers, diesel engines, draglines, and shovels are only a few "giantized" tools which are being joined by new earthmoving vehicle concepts of larger-than-life size. A critical item upon which any vehicle in this category depends is its tires. The dimensional scope of the tire program and the challenge of meeting the tire require- ments of the various applications being considered are currently being studied by the tire industry. Production facilities of the necessary size and capacity required to meet these needs are now in the process of design and fabrication. This paper discusses the highlights of this giant tire program. 710506. The U. S. Army Commercial Construction Equip- ment System Plan. Thomas A. Stumm, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Command. The demands on today's Army in the area of construction are greater than they have ever been. Rapidly advancing technology and the ever increasing reliance on sophis- ticated military systems and equipment have transformed the Army's (world-wide) construction mission into one which closely parallels the civilian construction industry. 135</page><page sequence="71">710507-710514 136 Because of the intense competition in the commercial market, the construction industry has long recognized the need for and has practiced continuous modernization of equipment through research and development. In rec- ognition of the same need for modernization, and to take full advantage of industry's advances in the state- of-the-art the Army has adopted a policy of equipping construction-type units with commercial construction equipment (CCE). 710507. Bare Base Site Preparation Equipment. James L. Clowers, U. S. Air Force. This paper reviews the Air Force Bare Base concept and the equipment needs to fulfill site preparation require- ments. Bare Base denotes a runway, aircraft parking, and a source of potable water. The equipment assigned to BCE for base maintenance was judged too small to do the needed site preparation work, and Red Horse heavy equipment was too heavy for air transport to locations around the globe. Economics negated development of special contruction equipment. As the program of procurement of commercial equipment developed, benefits such as commonality of parts, a world-wide distribution network, and ease of maintenance were realized, as well as elimination of development costs. Testing and evaluation have shown that the prognosis for the equipment and concept is good and should result in improved operational capability. 710508. Roll-Over Protective Structures for Farm and Construction Tractors - A 50-Year Review. James F. Arndt, Deere &amp; Co. Over the past 50 years, an estimated 30,000 tractor operators have been accidentally crushed under their overturned vehicles. During that time, stability, preventive devices, and education have been tried to reduce the number of such accidents. Within the past 15 years, worldwide activity has been concentrated on developing adequate roll-over protective structures (ROPS) for operator protection. In order to measure the adequacy of the structures, various worldwide performance standards have been created. The latest include those of the SAE, which recognizes the need for an ROPS to absorb energy in order to minimize injury to the operator. 710509. Design and Testing of Rollover Protective Struc- tures in Accordance with SAE J395. William P. Macarus, International Harvester Co. Plastic analysis type of analytical calculations are in- cluded in this paper as a guide for designers to size Rollover Protective Structures to meet SAE J395. Basic design considerations are given including material selec- tion, brittle failures, local buckling, and allowable deflec- tions. 710511. Soil is an Engineering Material. D. R. Freitag, U. S. Army Waterways Experiment Station. Soil mechanics deals primarily with static or quasi static cases, rather than with dynamic loadings. In depth studies of the various interactions of machine and soil have not developed results which could be termed universal. The problem with soil is that properties vary from place to place (over a wide range), and at a particular place, soil properties vary from day to day, depending on climate, weather, and topography. The author discusses the nature of soil and kinds of analytical measurements needed, including the use of classification systems, development of standardized meas- urement conditions and techniques, correlating test results, validating models, and solving design problems, both vehicle and pavement. Soil property measurements are essential in engi- neering applications of soil machine systems and there is a pressing need for the engineering community to get on with this task. 710512. Soil Measurements Related to the Performance of Soil-Machine Systems. Carl A. Reaves and Robert L. Schafer, U. S. Department of Agri- culture. The necessity of incorporating soil measurements in the evaluation of the performance of any soil working machine is presented. Emphasis is given to approaches to design problems, primary soil forces pertinent to a soil-machine system, and types of soil failures that are operable in a soil-machine system. Examples from research studies are given to demonstrate the importance of considering the soil in the evaluation of the per- formance of soil-working machines. 710513. The Soil Compaction Process and Methods of Measurement* E. T. Selig, State University of New York at Buffalo. The densification of soil by mechanical manipulation is called compaction. Although compaction has been a fundamental part of earthwork construction for decades, the development of compactors has evolved independent- ly of the advances in soil mechanics for the most part and has concerned the properties of soil only in a qualitative way. This appears to be a result of the traditional separation of the two disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the important factors affecting soil compaction and to show their relationship to the resulting product. Common methods of evaluating properties of compacted soils are also described. The emphasis is placed on practical considerations rather than on theory. 710514. Vibrational Characteristics of Man. J. N. Mac- duff, Duke University. The frequency response and unit impulse response of man was determined by transient testing and subsequent data processing. In all cases, the response is that of the head for input at the feet or chair base. Vertically, man responds much like a uniform rod. Laterally, the response is similar to that of a nonuniform beam in bending.</page><page sequence="72">710515-710527 Many of the figures presented here are reproduced by the kind permission of Sound and Vibration. 710515. The Development of a Seat Suspension for Mobile Construction Equipment. Donald J. Zach, Universal Oil Products Co. A seat suspension has been developed to isolate the operator from high amplitude-low frequency motion characteristics of large, rubber-tired, earthmoving vehi- cles. The motion of the suspension is unique in that it allows for 7 in. of vertical motion at the operator's "H" point with little or no motion of the lower legs and feet. In addition to greater operator comfort, this ar- rangement makes possible better control and safer operation. 710516. Operator's Enclosures. R. N. Sellon, Stolper Industries, Inc. Design parameters to be considered in developing suitable operator's enclosures, and factors involved in making the enclosure compatible with the particular vehicle are reviewed. Though cab and vehicle designers must coop- erate to develop a functional design, they must also take into consideration factors such as styling, safety, visibility, pressurization, and air conditioning needs. A detailed analysis of sound attenuation in the operator's enclosure is presented. Use of shock mounts, floor mats, fiberglass, perforated hardboard, and spray-on sound deadener are suggested for effective attenuation of sound. Two safety features taken into account are maximum visibility for the operator and roll-over protection in the cab. With proper planning in cab development, the result will be a safe, quiet, pleasant atmosphere in which the operator can work. 710517. The Use of Graphics in Computer-Aided Manu- facturing. P. A. Lunday, IBM Corp. Information must be current and the computer and data must be attainable to the man doing the job. New approaches and new concepts can help to make computer-aided manufacturing a reality in the next few years. Computer-aided manufacturing, and with the intro- duction of graphics into this planning, will give a new look into the progress of computer applications. 710519. Microfilm and Its Impact on the Technical Man. George H. Harmon, Information International. Microfilm is an important engineering tool in the restructuring of various types of information necessary for resolving problems. The various forms and sizes of microfilm are described, as are microfiche, the process of recording information on film, various viewing devices, and the combined use of computers and microfilm. 710521. The Seafloor Excavator - A Concept. Earl J. Beck, Naval Civil Engineering Lab. This paper discusses potential problems in designing highly specialized construction equipment for use on the deep-ocean bottom. Possible solutions and a program to optimize the design, reliability, and capability of a Seafloor Excavator, if and when built, are presented. Major areas of technological concern in developing excavation equipment are discussed. 710522. The Design and Construction of an Underwater Dredge. John A. Mardesich, Ocean Science and Engineering, Inc. The world's first underwater dredge is at work successfully replenishing badly eroded beaches in Florida. Existing off-the-shelf components have been utilized in the un- derwater dredge, extending dredging techniques where surface dredges have not been able to operate because of wind and wave action. 710525. Simulating Tractive Performance. R. L. Pershing, Deere &amp; Co. A new simulation technique has been developed which shows considerable utility in predicting the tractive performance of four-wheel-drive vehicles. This technique overcomes the usual difficulty encountered in solving a set of nonlinear equations to determine vehicle forces. A unique feature of the model is the prediction of individual wheel forces and slips, thus aiding design of the distri- bution of tractive power. The simulated results are compared with tractive forces measured on a JD540 Skidder Tractor having four-wheel drive and frame steer. 710526. Determination of Wheel Loader Static and Dynamic Stability. Dale H. Unruh, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The development and verification of a mathematical model and analytical techniques for the analysis of wheel loader static and dynamic stability are described. Re- sulting computer programs allow designers to predict stability in the concept stage of design. An example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of this technique. 710527. Stability Analysis of an Articulated Vehicle Steering System. Rolland D. Scholl, Caterpillar Tractor Co.; Klein, Richard E. and Richard E. Klein, University of Illinois. A steering system for an articulated vehicle was analyzed to gain an improved understanding of the closed loop stability characteristics. The analysis was applied to an electrohydraulic system and is applicable to more general types of systems. Since the parameters of electrohydraulic valves are well known, a simulation model including the hydraulic system and the vehicle dynamics, was easily derived. Using the simulation, the oil mass resonance was determined to be the most critical parameter and was controlled by adding compensation in the steering system 137</page><page sequence="73">710528-710534 138 closed loop. The paper describes the steering system, simulation model, and stability criteria. 710528. Challenges for the Earthmoving Industry. A. J. Rutherford. Dept. of the Army. The advance of civilization and increase in world population have created unusual demands for improve- ment of man's earthworking capabilities. Consequently, the United States, as a world leader in the field of earthmoving technology, faces a significant challenge to maintain its position. Ways and means must be found to conserve and expand resources, improve technology, meet competition, and better protect the public welfare. The nature of the challenge is subjectively discussed, and specific suggestions are made for individual and coop- erative efforts to improve the situation. 710529. Emergency-Parking Brake System for Large Wheel Loaders and Dozers. Thomas E. Cochran, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Caterpillar Tractor Co. has introduced a new emergency- parking brake system for its line of large wheel loaders and wheel type tractors. This system includes a multidisk- spring-applied/hydraulically-released-emergency-parking brake, a hydraulic control system providing both auto- matic and manual application of the brake, and an audio- visual warning system for the operator. The brake is for use on vehicles in the 60,000-140,000 lb range and is designed specifically to provide automatic application of the emergency-parking brake in the event of a loss of service brakes. 710530. Steering and Braking Systems on the Articulated Motor Grader. Lon B. Eberhart, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. The steering and braking systems used on the all- hydraulic JD-570 articulating grader were designed with the safety of the operator in mind. These systems are given priority over the other related hydraulic systems on the grader through the use of a priority valve. An accumulator is provided to store hydraulic energy for the steering and braking systems in the event of a power failure. In addition, the brake valve is capable of acting as a pump to supply pressure oil to the service brakes, if required. A mechanically actuated secondary brake effective on all four tandem wheels is also provided. 710531. Design in Powder Metallurgy and Sinterforging. S. W. McGee, Burgess Norton Mfg. Co. The powder metallurgy process for parts fabrication, as well as the sinterforge process, starts with the uniaxial compaction of metal powder in closed dies, thus imparting shape and initiating properties development. Sintering subsequent to compaction further develops properties, and may be followed by coining, resintering, or in the case of sinterforging, by hot compaction. Heat treatment may be applied to either product. The design procedure discussed in this paper develops a plan with the objective of achieving a three way balance between part function, fabrication, and cost. The stages of the procedure include: analysis of process characteristics, development of process capability, dimensioning, devel- oping specifications, and developing cost feasibility. 1971 SAE Transactions 710532. Application of Similitude in Engineering Anal- ysis. George Bovis, John Deere Waterloo Trac- tor Works. This paper provides a detailed procedure for applying similitude (dimensional analysis) to engineering problems where there is not enough information for an analytical solution. Similitude allows the investigator to use exper- imental data to develop empirical prediction equations relating the parameters involved. Two examples illustrate the entire procedure. One is a four-pi-term problem and the other is an eight-pi-term. Both problems have exact analytical solutions, and the original data were computed analytically. This approach allows direct comparison of results obtained from the empirical equations with exact solutions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710533. A Practical Approach to Centrifugal Pump De- sign. Walter A. Kabele, Construction Machinery Co. This paper outlines a unique approach to the design of a common centrifugal pump. It is based on establishing a three point performance curve - namely, the shutoff head (zero capacity), the design point, and the maximum capacity that represents the desired performance - and then designing the pump to meet these conditions. In order to eliminate the need of various coefficients, Stepanoffs dimensionless chart is used to select and establish a head-capacity value at the best efficiency point. Modified vector diagrams together with a sample problem showing the necessary equations, Charts, and calculations illustrate the simplicity of design. The problem is based on a radial design impeller at 245 gpm at 75 ft of head and 3450 rpm. Other pump capacities may be similarly designed by varying the design parameters. 1971 SAE Transactions 710534. The Fundamentals of ACV Habitability and Ride Characteristics. Robert G. Moore, Bell Aero- space Div., Textron. Many factors, including vehicle motion, temperature, humidity, atmospheric contamination, and noise level, influence the habitability, or ride comfort, of any vehicle. All of these factors must be considered in the design of an air cushion vehicle (ACV). This paper discusses the motion of the craft induced by traveling over a rough surface. This motion may be reduced by suitable design of the lift and skirt systems, to minimize pressure changes within the cushion.</page><page sequence="74">710536-710545 710536. The Menasco Energy Absorbing Unit and Its Application to Bumper Systems. Giles A. Ken- dall, Menasco Mfg. Co. A compressible solid shock isolator is a combination spring and damper which makes use of a silicone elastomer media to achieve these two functions. It is a candidate for use in energy absorbing bumper systems because of its favorable volume, weight, automatic reset capability, functional efficiency, reliability, and cost. E/A bumper systems must be designed to accommodate a wide variety of loading conditions. System qualification re- quires the use of both pendulum and barrier type testing. 710537. Application of the Hydraulic Shock Absorber to a Vehicle Crash Protection System. Douglas P. Taylor, Tayco Developments, Inc. Energy absorbing crash protection systems are now being developed using various types of shock absorbing devices. This paper deals with design parameters involved in producing such a system. Basic shock absorber concepts as applied to this problem are treated in general discussion centering on hydraulic devices. Governing equations are presented dealing with the design of a hybrid device combining a shock absorber and a compressible medium return mechanism capable of being used as a 5 mph zero damage bumper system for a passenger car. 710540. Vehicle Impact Analysis. F. F. Timpner, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. This paper shows how to evaluate the impact between two different size vehicles with different energy-absorbing bumper systems. A pendulum will correlate with a barrier for head-on impacts, but not for corner impacts. 710541. Development of Van Driver Eye Ellipses. J. D. Hromi and J. Versace, Ford Motor Co.; and C. O. Smith, University of Detroit. This study was undertaken to determine to what extent the passenger car eye ellipses have applicability in van-type truck package design and to produce a new practical design tool, if necessary. Eye positions of van drivers were found to be distributed differently from those for passenger car drivers and from those obtained by the procedure outlined in SAE J941b, Motor Vehicle Driver's Eye Range. There were produced in this study, tables of parameter values that a van-package designer can use readily to position eye-location distributions in space as a function of the azimuth and elevation angles of many targets in the forward field of view. These tables are available upon request from SAE. 1971 SAE Transactions 710542. Driver Evaluation Study of Rear View Mirror Reflectance Levels. T. M. Mansour, Ford Motor Co. There has been a lack of information on image brightness in automotive rear vision systems as related to the driver's needs. This paper presents data on driver evaluation of brightness, in the form of visibility and glare ratings of rear view mirror reflectance levels, based upon actual driving experiences. The effects of roadway types and various ambient lighting conditions are discussed, and ranges of acceptable reflectance levels are recommended. This study was a task group effort, performed by the SAE Rear Vision Subcommittee. 1971 SAE Transactions 710543. The Effects of Convex Exterior Mirrors on Lane-Changing and Passing Performance of Drivers. Rudolf G. Mortimer, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. Drivers carried out a lane-changing and passing maneuver using convex and plane exterior mirrors alone or in combination with a plane interior mirror. The data showed that the addition of the plane interior mirror compensated for judgmental errors found when convex mirrors were used alone. When the speed difference was 15 mph between the overtaking car and the subject's car, subjects accepted gaps that were too short irrespective of the exterior mirror type. The data suggested that exterior convex mirrors of radii greater than 30 in. may be used reasonably safely by drivers and would have the advan- tage of providing a considerably increased field-of-view compared to currently used exterior mirrors. 1971 SAE Transactions 710544. Fourier Cam Design Techniques. Jerry L. Hardi- man, Bell Telephone Labs.; and Frank H. Speckhart, University of Michigan. A digital computer method employing Fourier series and transfer function notation is presented for calculating a cam profile that will give a desired output motion of a flexible system. The system model must be linear but can have essentially any number of degrees-of-freedom, and damping at any point in the system is permitted. It is also possible to specify the best cam profile of a system running in a given speed range. Forces at any point in the system can be calculated by the method, and accurate predictions of jump can be made. 710545. Material Considerations for Automobile Cam- shafts. M. P. Jarrett, G.K.N. Forgings and Castings. A variety of materials is currently specified for automobile camshafts. The choice depends on a number of factors, with resistance to surface deterioration the most impor- tant. Published research suggests that satisfactory oper- ation of a material depends not only upon the operating conditions of stress, velocity, and lubrication, but also upon the follower material and possibly upon the shape of cam. Analysis of available evidence, augmented by addi- tional material testing, suggests that two materials could cover the majority of camshaft applications. These are chilled iron for highly stressed applications, and induc- 139</page><page sequence="75">710546-710552 140 tion-hardened grey iron for applications where stresses are moderate, and concessions can be made to economy. 710546. New Criteria for Air Conditioning Belt Drive Design. Ashok K. Goyal and Allen J. Bentley, Engine &amp; Foundry Div., Ford Motor Co. Belt drives are simple and efficient and are widely used, but they are very often a source of vibration and noise. Usually, in the case of the automobile engine accessory drive system, especially air conditioning drive, consid- erable development time is spent on reducing this noise and vibration to an acceptable level. Herein, an analytical method is presented which allows the designer to ap- proach this objective in the initial design stages. It is shown that a number of variables such as torque characteristics, belt span, belt material, and construction contribute to the objectionable noise. 710547. A New Concept in Oil Control Rings. K. J. Nisper, Muskegon Piston Ring Co., Questor Corp. A new design oil ring has been developed which shows considerable promise for the automotive piston engine. This oil ring consists of two pieces instead of the normal three. It offers improved long term oil economy, ease of installation, and lower costs. 710548. The Practical Application of Computers to the Design of Bearings in Automotive Engines. R. H. Spikes and J. P. Pirault, Vandervell Products Ltd. There is a large amount of theoretical work available on the subject of hydrodynamic design of bearings. This paper describes how, with the use of computer aided techniques, the various factors involved in the bottom end design of automotive piston engines are developed. In the study of the behavior of oil film in a journal bearing, the problem has been to determine what simpli- fying assumptions were valid in order to present useful information at a low enough cost. Discussed in some detail are possible lubrications systems, material specifications, and hydrodynamic per- formance of the bottom end design of engines. With the use of correct simplifying assumptions, simple computer programs, and visual presentation, good use can be made of the available theory to aid the engine designer. 710549. Control Systems for Medium Size Gas Turbines. Jan Ederveen, Woodward Governor Co. This paper describes a modular concept for fuel controls used with medium-size, split-shaft gas turbines in the 8000-25000 hp range. The self-imposed restriction does not limit these controls to this power range. Modifications allow the use of the same components for virtually any gas turbine application. The modular system combines a number of standard components such as fuel valves, limiters, electronic circuits, and station controls together with commercially available items, such as shutoff valves, pressure regulators, etc. Special items to suit a particular specification can easily be added. This type of system offers the control engineer a complete package at an economical price. The application of electrical governors has shown a phenomenal development during the last decade. The discussion, therefore, will concentrate on this type of governor. The demand for larger blocks of power caused an increase in the application of electric generators driven by two or more aircraft type of gas generators. These installations introduce some unique control problems with respect to load division between gas generators. For such installations using combined cycles (by adding inde- pendent head recovery units) the load division between gas generators might have to be unbalanced to suit the demand on the heat recovery units. 710550. Digital Computer Methods for Prediction of Gas Turbine Dynamic Response. A. J. Fawke, Gas Council Engrg. Res. Station, England; and H. I. H. Saravanamuttoo, Carleton University. Methods of simulating gas turbine transient behavior are reviewed. Two digital computer methods are described, one assuming instantaneous flow match and the other making use of intercomponent volumes to compute the rate of change of pressure at different locations. Results are shown for a variety of engines, good agreement between engine test and simulation being achieved in each case. 1971 SA E Transactions 710551. Controls for Single Shaft Gas Turbine Vehicles. Bernard B. Poore, John Deere Technical Center. The single-shaft gas turbine is a satisfactory vehicular powerplant when an infinitely variable transmission is available and a suitable control system is provided. Vehicle operating requirements and single-shaft turbine characteristics must be considered to develop the control concept. An integrated electronic turbine-transmission control system provides the needed flexibility for varying application of this power system. Satisfactory operation of such a system in two modes is demonstrated by results of field evaluation of a test vehicle. 710552. Development of a High Tip Speed Radial Turbine Systems for a Small Turboalternator. Casimir Rogo, Teledyne C.A.E. The design and rig development of a 1970 fps tip speed radial turbine, volute, combustor, and exhaust as an integrated system is discussed. The components form the hot section of a United States Army turboshaft engine for powering portable electrical generator sets in the 30, 45, 60 kw range. Aerothermodynamic design highlights, rig testing, and modifications necessary to meet design objectives are covered.</page><page sequence="76">710553-710560 710553. The Turbine Interstage Diffuser. Charles A. Amann, Gary E. Nordenson and Elias H. Razinsky, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The incentive for use of an interstage diffuser in a free-shaft gas turbine engine is briefly examined and some pertinent published background data reviewed. Tests of two annular diffusers behind an upstream turbine, show the deleterious effects of turbine exit flow non-uniformity on diffuser behavior. The flow acceleration provided by the area contraction of a power turbine nozzle located at the diffuser exit substantially improves the nature of the flow previously found to exist at the diffuser exit in the absence of the nozzle. 1971 SA E Transactions 710554. Application of the Finite Element Method to Predict Static and Dynamic Response of an Unshrouded Centrifugal Compressor Blade. W. R. Buell and F. M. Simpson, Ford Motor Co. A radial element centrifugal compressor vane has been analyzed by means of the Structural Analysis and Matrix Interpretive System (SAMIS). The displacement method and finite element technique were used. Initial studies of configurations where exact solutions were readily avail- able were conducted to ensure the applicability of the method. The results of the stress analysis are presented along with the deflections. The first natural frequency was also determined along with the associated mode shape and these results are also presented. 710555. The International Harvester New 300/400 Diesel Engines. J. C. Basiletti, G. J. Maat, E. F. Petrák and W. A. Wallace, International Harvester Co. A new series of heavy duty diesel engines has been developed by the Construction Equipment Division of the International Harvester Company. Nine engines are the result of two basic engine series, the 300 and 400. The engines have been designed for commonality of parts and for economical high volume tooling. This paper deals with some of the aspects of the development, testing, and application of the engines. 710556. Manufacturing the New International Harvester 300-400 Series Diesel Engines. George R. DePrima and Robert J. Klein, International Harvester Co. A new series of heavy duty diesel engines has been put into production by the Construction Equipment Division of the International Harvester Company. The new engines known as the 300-400 series displace a number of older IH units. The engines have been tooled for commonality of parts and for economical high volume production. This paper deals with some aspects of the tooling, fabrication, assembly, and production testing of the engines. 710557. The Mack Maxidyne, ENDT865 Diesel with Dynatard Engine Brake. J. F. Greathouse, R. B. Gibson and F. J. Pekar, Mack Trucks, Inc. Progression of the successful engine program exemplified by the Mack ENDT675 Maxidyne Six, having an essentially constant horsepower characteristic in the operating speed range, has led to the development and production of the new Mack ENDT865, Maxidyne V-8 having similarly ordered performance at higher output. Significant advances in design to maintain reliability at high loadings including a new injection pump, a simplified oil system, and a single turbocharger arrange- ment are discussed, as well as a new integral engine brake. The Mack Dynatard Engine Brake is specifically covered in the second part of this paper. 710558. Development Work on the Mercedes-Benz Com- mercial Diesel Engine "Model Series 400". Heinz Hoffmann, Daimler-Benz AG, Germany. The development and testing of the new series of Mercedes-Benz diesel engines, the Model Series 400, is discussed in this paper. The series includes 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-cyl V-engines and 5- and 6-cyl in-line engines. All feature a 4.922 in. bore and 5.117 in. stroke, a piston displacement of 97.4 cu in. per cylinder, water cooling, and direct fuel injection. Specific items covered are the combustion system, ignition, emissions, pistons, cylinder head gaskets, and the cooling system. 710559. Urban Transportation and Emissions. H. Chaput, Ottawa Transportation Commission. This paper describes techniques and other significant factors to satisfy good maintenance, consistent with the control and abatement of diesel exhaust emissions in urban transit operations. Major stress is placed on the use of instruments, not only for inspection, diagnosing, and correcting obvious faults which cause black and blue smoke, but also for monitoring engine deterioration and indicating when motor and torque oil should be changed. Engine wear is cited as the major enemy to both engine life and control of less obvious yet more troub- lesome emissions - and fuel dilution and dirty engine conditions as major causes of wear. The use of new devices to reduce fumes and an approach to engine and component replacement for an optimum balance between long life and good performance are described. 710560. Railway Equipment for Container Traffic. R. W. Radford, Canadian National Railways. The use of containers for the movement of intercontinent- al freight traffic is increasing. Special equipment is being developed by the railways to provide a suitable envi- ronment for the overland part of the movement. Con- tainer cars must allow for efficient loading and unloading methods, and must provide protection against lading damage caused by vibration or impact. In some cases electrical power must be supplied in transit for heating or cooling purposes. 141</page><page sequence="77">710561-710569 142 710561. The Non Rail Extension of the GO Transit System. William T. Howard, Government of Ontario Transit. On July 6, 1970, an experimental Dial-a-Bus feeder service to the GO Transit rail commuter service at Bay Ridges was introduced by the Department of Highways, Ontario.

The Design and Development of a Turbine- Gearbox for Use in an Automotive Organic Rankine Cycle System. Robert E. Barber, Bar- ber-Nichols Engrg. Co., Everett H. Alford, Lear Motors Corp.; and John C. Bond, Barber- Nichols Engrg. Co. An estimated 60-80% of air pollution caused by auto- mobile exhaust gases has resulted in the establishment of a national goal to reduce automotive emissions significantly by 1975. Consequently, a government program to dem- onstrate at least two non conventional automobile power plants by 1975 has been set up by NAPCA, with a proposed two billion dollar budget for research. The following paper summarizes the design and development of a small, lightweight, efficient, high speed, turbine prime mover and a speed reducing gearbox. The turbine aerodynamic design and mechanical design are shown. The gearbox reduced the turbine's high (45,000 rpm) speed to the low (3800 rpm) output speed necessary for use in a conventional, three-speed automobile trans- mission. Complete fabrication of the turbine-gearbox was accomplished in approximately five weeks, and the problems and procedures used are described. The initial development tests are also summarized. 710565. Permanent Magnet Generators for Portable Military Power. E. F. Hammond, Jr. and A. E. King, Westinghouse Electric Corp.; and A. L. Jokl, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center. The United States Army MERDC has a continuing program to develop and update a family of portable and/or mobile power generation sets for use by the United States military services. In the past decade, a number of new permanent magnet materials have been developed, far exceeding the energy products of earlier materials. Recognizing the potential of these new mate- rials, and looking toward a new family of lightweight power generation sets, a feasibility study and preliminary design were completed for a 10 kW, 60,000 rpm rotating field permanent magnet generator. 710566. Rotor Dynamics and Bearing Investigations for a 10 KW Turboalternator Unit. T. Psichogios, Solar Div., International Harvester Co.

Unbalance response of the rotor system is covered along with a case of bearing excited fractional frequency whirl. The capabilities of the rolling element bearings are discussed, and the effects of bearing design details on fatigue life are summarized. 710567. Design Aspects of a 10KW, Multi-frequency, Cycloconverter/High-Speed Alternator, Electri- cal Power System. John C. Guyeska, Martin F. Drlik and Gerald H. Horstman, Lear Siegler, Inc. The paper gives a discussion of a turboalternator, frequency converter system designed to meet MERDC requirements for single-phase or three-phase quality power at 60 or 400 Hz. Some of the pertinent design aspects discussed are the development of equivalent converter/alternator circuits to establish alternator rating, and some design consideration of a high-speed, solid-rotor alternator. 710568. Analytical Simulation of Fuel Injection in Diesel Engines. G. A. Becchi, FIAT, S.p.A. The increase of specific output in diesel engines which has developed lately, and the need for a quick response to the market requirements, has imposed remarkable changes in the design of the diesel engine components. This has also resulted in a change in the design of injection equipment. In fact, the dimensioning of the equipment as a simple definition of geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the various components in the designing phase has been replaced by the necessity to single out possible operation faults and to define the measures necessary for their elimination. This is possible only with the aid of highly improved calculation methods, suitable to simulate as accurately as possible the phenomena to be identified. The calculation method discussed in this paper was carried out on the basis of these above considerations. This method was obviously not originated in its present form, but is the result of amplifications and improve- ments, still in progress, made over many years, in accordance with the techniques that became available from time to time.

The computer results are compared with transient pressures as measured on an actual fuel injection system operated on a test bench. The comparisons show the accuracy and validity of this simulation scheme. Special attention is given to some of the important factors that affect the accuracy of the simulation model. These include the effect of pressure on the fuel bulk modulus and wave speed, the pipe line residual pressure, and the coefficient of discharge of important orifices.

Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. Pavements, no matter what their construction and surface features, provide no traction or skid resistance when they are covered with a deep layer of water. Pavement design and other factors inhibiting or promoting hydroplaning are discussed, as are possible remedial measures. This leads naturally into a review of the pavement surface features that control the reduction of skid resistance with speed. The polishing of pavement surfaces and those of aggregate particles is discussed in the light of present knowledge and practices. Finally, the problems which the future might bring and the options for their solutions are highlighted. 710573. Highway Skid Resistance - A Plan of Action. W. A. Goodwin, The University of Tennessee. The evolution of roadbuilding has occurred because of the need to move people and goods economically and safely between their points of origin and destination. Engineers over the decades have built roads to meet these needs with varying degrees of success. One major goal throughout this period had been that of providing all-weather, skid-safe travel for the motoring public. In providing skid-safe travel, the highway engineer has first resorted to studying the task and then developing solutions. This paper presents the present state of knowledge regarding the influence of highway geometries and pavement surface on skid resistance. It summarizes the techniques of building a pavement initially for skid resistance and also corrective measures for existing pavements. 710574. Reduction of Wet Pavement Accidents on Los Angeles Metropolitan Freeways. Eugene E. Farnsworth and Melvin H. Johnson, Dept. of Public Works, State of California. Improved pavement surface construction methods for new pavements and the use of pavement grooving and thin blankets for existing pavements are solutions to the wet pavement accident problem. Before and after accident studies of pavement grooving projects indicate a reduction of 85% of the wet pavement accidents. 710575. Passenger Tire Power Consumption. D. R. Elliott, W. K. Klamp and W. E. Kraemer, Uniroyal Tire Co. The rolling resistance of a tire can have a marked effect on such factors as gasoline mileage and high speed durability. In an effort to understand better the mechanisms involved, 80 tires were analyzed. This analysis resulted in dividing the rolling resistance into a component (RJ independent of speed, and a component (Rb), which is very speed dependent. The body of this paper discusses the effect of operating conditions and tire design varia- tions on both of these components. 1971 SAE Transactions 710576. Power Loss Testing of Passenger Tires. C. W. Floyd, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Laboratory power loss test procedure and the effect of varying conditions on power loss is discussed. An attempt is made to correlate laboratory rolling resistance with fuel economy. The information is presented from the per- spective of a tire engineer, with the objective of providing useful information to automotive designers as well as other interested parties. 710577. How to Obtain the Desired Shape of the Fuel-Air Ratio Curve in Two-Stroke Cycle Gasoline Engines. Alfred Jante, Technical University Dresden. The effects of fuel-air ratio on speed have been shown to depend on the phenomena taking place in the carburetors of two-stroke gasoline engines. These phenomena and the subsequent reactions in the engine are described. Methods of reducing adverse effects are presented and computa- 143</page><page sequence="79">710578-710583 144 tions for estimating vibrational limits of fluid flow in different types of carburetors with and without damping devices are given. It is shown that a constant fuel-air ratio over a wide range of speeds is important to economical operation of two-stroke cycle engines. Discussion: C. H.

Otto Kruggel, Motoren- und Turbinen- Union Friedrichshafen GmbH. For a geometrically simplified piston model, temperatures in the crown center and at the first ring groove as well as the rotationally symmetrical temperature fields of the crown were first calculated according to the equation of Gintsburg (5) with the assumption of constant temper- atures and conditions of heat transfer in the combustion chamber and at the cylinder finds for different sizes of cooled and uncooled pistons. The temperatures could be measured continuously by means of thermocouples located at 36 measuring points in the piston and 12 measuring points at the cylinder of a test engine of 80 mm (3.15 in.) bore up to an engine speed of n = 2800 rpm. In this way the agreement between the calculated and the experimental results could be checked. Discussion: T. LeFeuvre, University of Ottawa.; Author's closure 1971 SA E Transactions 710579. Scavenging Model Solves Problems in Gas Burning Engine. Nabi Dedeoglu, Sulzer Brothers Ltd. An application of model tests based on laws of similarity are developed in this paper for the analysis of the scavenging and gaseous mixing process in gas-burning engines. Systematic tests disclosed that only the Strouhal model law and the density ratio between the substances involved (Euler's similarity law) are significant. It is also pointed out that fluids are particularly convenient for examination of the scavenging and mixing processes. The model tests deliver qualitative and quantitative predictions on scavenging and mixture formation in the actual engine. 1971 SA E Transactions 710580. A Modern Outboard Design - Johnson and Evinrude 50 hp. Don F. Kueny and Michael J. Boerma, Outboard Marine Corp. The two-stroke cycle engine has been brought to a high level of refinement in marine outboard motors. This paper describes a recent design with emphasis on the use of exhaust system pressure waves to influence cylinder scavenging and charging. Included is a discussion of how the design was tailored to meet marketing and tooling requirements. 710581. The Rotary Engines of Yanmar Outboard Motor. Koj iro Yamaoka and Hiroshi Tado, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. This paper covers the structural features of the rotary engines, which represent the first outboard application of this type of engine. The advantages of the rotary engine for outboard motors are described, including test results. Discussion: George T. Bovis, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works; and Paul H.

Curtiss- Wright's Development Status of the Stratified Charge Rotating Combustion Engine. Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp. The paper covers exploratory development of the rotating combustion (RC) engine spark ignited stratified charge versions since 1966. Configuration improvements resulting in increased power and reduced fuel consumption are described and test results cited. Exhaust emissions are presented, with and without a catalytic converter, and compared with carbureted RC engine results as well as limited diesel engine data. It is concluded that the technical bases for an efficient, lightweight, economic, low emission powerplant capable of broad range operation have been demonstrated. Weight and displacement para- metric curves are presented for one family of advanced higher speed engines. Discussion: Paul H.

Some Effects of Experimental Vehicle Emission Control Systems on Engine Deposits and Wear. Loren G. Pless, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Vehicle emission control systems can markedly affect the environment within the engine crankcase, and could thereby increase engine deposits, wear, and oil degra- dation. Tests run using 1965-1970 model United States passenger cars, operating with leaded commercial gaso- lines in several types of service, evaluated the effects on deposits and wear of three types of experimental vehicle emission control systems: 1. Crankcase storage systems for reducing vehicle evaporative emissions. 2. An exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system for reducing oxides of nitrogen. 3. Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) systems for controlling crankcase emissions. In engines operated with production crankcase purg- ing rates, crankcase storage increased engine rusting in short-trip service, and increased sludging and valve train wear in low-speed, stop-and-go service. Reducing the crankcase purging rate to overcome hot-starting and driveability problems with crankcase storage caused even larger deposit and wear increases. Engine rusting in short-trip service was increased with EGR. In other tests, heavy lead-salt deposits accumulated in the recirculation system.</page><page sequence="80">710584-710588 Doubling the PCV valve idle air-flow rate greatly reduced engine rusting in short-trip service, and reduced engine deposits and oil oxidation in mixed city-suburban- expressway service. 1971 SAE Transactions 710584. Effect of Unleaded Fuel on Lubricant Perform- ance. W. W. Crouse, R. H. Johnson and W. H. Reiland, Sun Oil Co. The performance of motor oils in engines run on unleaded fuels was evaluated using several makes of United States cars. These oils, SAE 10W-40 grades, were run in high mileage or turnpike service, as well as suburban service. The performance with unleaded fuels was not significantly different from that for leaded fuels in the areas of wear, sludge, varnish, or rust. Valve seat recession was detected in several of the cars, but had an effect on performance in only one case. Further testing using laboratory engines and a patrol fleet in pursuit service demonstrated the effect of lubricant composition on valve seat recession. In addition, it was found that engines preconditioned on leaded fuels afforded better protection against valve seat recession than new engines. 710585. Projected Lubricant Requirements of Engines Operating with Lead-Free Gasoline. N. E. Gallo- poulos, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Future low emissions engines will burn unleaded gasoline. Compared with engines of 1970, future engines will have lower concentrations of NOx in the blowby gases, and lower blowby flow-rates; however, oil temperatures will probably be unchanged. The consequences of these conditions for engines using high quality (SE) oils at current drain intervals are: virtual elimination of rust, reduction of sludge, no effect on wear and oil thickening, and possible worsening of varnish. Therefore, extension of the drain interval with SE oils in the future may be possible, but final decisions will depend on the findings of research in the areas of engine wear and varnish, and oil thickening. 1971 SAE Transactions 710586. Factors Influencing the Cyclic Variation of Com- bustion of Spark Ignition Engine. Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology; Takehisa Yama- guchi, Toyota Motors Co. Ltd.; and Yukio Umemura, Nissan Motors Co. Ltd. A statistical measurement of cyclic variation in combus- tion of a spark ignition engine generated by changes of mixture conditions in the cylinder was compared with the actual measurement of variation of flow velocity and mixture ratio. From these statistical data plus further analytical study, the correlations between the combustion speed, flow velocity, and mixture ratio were shown. These correlations explain the phenomenon of combustion variation - it increases with the increase of combustion period. Regarding cyclic variation of combustion, although every possible factor influencing the variation of com- bustion was eliminated, there still remains the variation caused by the variation of mean flow velocity in the cylinder. Thus, to decrease the combustion variation, it is fundamentally necessary to raise the combustion speed and decrease the variation of mean flow velocity in the cylinder. Since the rate of increase of the combustion variation caused by the variation of flow velocity decreases when the flow velocity becomes faster, the fast swirling one directional undisturbed mainstream increases the combustion speed and is accompanied by small cyclic fluctuation which produce stronger turbulence that ef- ficiently contribute to this effect. By measuring the curve of S(dp/dt) max versus mixture ratio, it was possible to indicate whether mixture ratio or velocity variations were causing cyclic fluctu- ations. Also it was clarified that Tpmax was able to accurately indicate the trend of mean combustion period. 710587. Effect of Combustion Chamber Surface Temper- ature on Exhaust Hydrocarbon Concentration. J. T. Wentworth, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The relationship between surface temperature and exhaust hydrocarbon concentration was explored by installing surface thermocouples at three locations in the combus- tion chamber of a single-cylinder engine. Coolant tem- perature, coolant passage surface scale, and ethylene glycol in the coolant affected exhaust hydrocarbon concentration through changes in surface temperature. As power output increased, combustion chamber surface temperature rose; and exhaust hydrocarbon concentration fell. The increase in surface temperature accounted for about 43% of the decrease in hydrocarbon concentration. The reason for the other 57% of the decrease is unknown, but it may have been caused by increasing gas temper- atures in the quench zone. Increasing surface temperature by engine modification would be expected to have adverse effects on engine octane requirement, volumetric efficiency, and oil oxi- dation. Discussion: P. S. Myers, O.

Influence of Homogeneous Charge on the Ex- haust Emissions of Hydrocarbons, Carbon Mon- oxide, and Nitric Oxide from a Multicylinder Engine. R. Lindsay, A. Thomas, J. A. Wood- worth and E. G. Zeschmann, Shell Research Ltd. A fuel-air mixture generator has been developed which allows a vehicle to be run on a chassis dynamometer under both transient and steady-state conditions on premixed homogeneous gasoline-air mixtures using con- 145</page><page sequence="81">710589-710595 146 ventional nonleaded gasoline. Under these conditions cylinder-to-cylinder-variations of air/fuel ratio, and of carbon monoxide emission from a 90 cu in. 4-cyl engine were virtually eliminated, and variations of NO emissions were greatly reduced. However, variations in hydrocarbon emission were scarcely affected. With the premixed charge the vehicle could be run on an extremely lean air-fuel mixture while retaining good driveability. At an air/fuel ratio of 22.5/1, CO and NO emissions over the United States Federal cycle according to the 1970 test procedure were 2.7 and 0.4 g/mile, respectively. However, unburned hydrocarbon emissions exceeded current legislative re- quirements. 710589. Techniques for Determining the Thermal Char- acteristics of Brake Drums and Discs. Frank H. Highley, General Motors Engineering Staff. Heat storage, heat dissipation, and cooling coefficients are defined; and equations, based on theory and practice, are developed with which values of the coefficients can be determined. Vehicle tests required are described. Use of the coefficients in predicting drum or disc temperatures is demonstrated, using coefficient values obtained in vehicle tests. Use of the cooling coefficient for simulating brake cooling on a brake dynamometer is demonstrated. 1971 SAE Transactions 710590. All Steel Brake Disc Development. R. H. Van- steenkiste and E. K. Buyze, The Budd Co. This paper discusses The Budd Co.'s development of a new and novel approach to an old product. It involves the design, development and manufacture of a brake disc for an automotive disc brake using materials other than cast iron. This product must have all the qualities of a cast iron disc, but must be competitive price-wise. The development of a solid disc would have been a relatively simple challenge; however, a ventilated type disc complicated the task by requiring a composite or welded structure. Real ingenuity in design and material processing was de- manded. The results are what is called the Budd "All Steel Brake Disc." 1971 SAE Transactions 710591. Semi-Metallics: A New Type of Friction Mate- rial. F. William Aldrich, The Bendix Corp. A new semi-metallic type of friction material has been developed which offers improved frictional stability and high temperature wear resistance. Having minimal organic content, these materials avoid the thermal sensitivity to chemical and physical change characteristic of typical friction materials. 1971 SAE Transactions 710592. Impact of Proposed Government Standards on Passenger Car Brake System Design. G. B. Hickner and J. L. Turak, The Bendix Corp. The Department of Transportation has proposed a new set of performance standards for passenger car brake systems. The impact of these requirements has been investigated analytically and experimentally. The results of these studies are presented. It is concluded that modifications are necessary to most of today's brake systems to meet these difficult standards. 710593. Brake System Safety Analysis. George R. Olsson and James A. Mateyka, Booz, Allen Applied Research, Inc.; and Joseph J. Innes, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. An important new technique in safety engineering for complex systems is the fault tree analysis method. The results of a motor vehicle brake system safety analysis using the fault tree technique are described. The work is directed toward the identification and ranking of brake system failure modes which may be critical as accident causation factors. Safety criticality for each failure mode is defined as the product of probability of occurrence and severity of effect on vehicle control. Failure data for the brake system components are obtained from maintenance and repair records of a large automobile leasing fleet. An effect scale is developed using a method for pooling expert judgements to obtain the relative ranking of various brake faults as to accident causation potential. The fault tree structure is employed to combine probability and effect to obtain the safety criticality value of each fault. Results are interpreted in relation to federal safety standards and motor vehicle inspection requirements. 1971 SAE Transactions 710594. Truck Frame Analysis Study. Oskar Michejda, Indiana Institute of Technology. A method of truck frame analysis is proposed to include the effects of forces acting in three dimensions as well as the effects of variable cross-sections, off shear-center loading, and joint flexibility. The interaction between the frame and other components of the vehicle is discussed and a method is proposed to include these effects in the static and dynamic stress analysis of the frame compo- nents. The dynamic effects on stresses are proposed to be included in experimentally determined dynamic stress factors defined in terms of dimensionless probability density functions for various frame components and on- and off-highway conditions. An experimental program is outlined for the evalu- ation of stiffness characteristics of the flexible joints, the upper bound of the horizontal force acting at the front axle, and the dynamic stress factors. General analysis of forces and deformations in the chassis due to drive-shaft impact and twisting of the vehicle is included in the appendices. 710595. A Torsional Strength Analysis of Truck Frames Using Open Section Members. Kunihiro Taka- hashi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A new method of torsional strength analysis has been</page><page sequence="82">710596-710601 developed for truck frames with open-section members. The conventional analytical methods often indicate values 2-20 times smaller or larger than the actual stress because of the actual load transmission between the frame members is different from generally accepted theory. In the present study, the stress distribution was measured in detail with an effective strain meter and the nature of the load transmission was made apparent. In the author's new method of analysis, this load transmission is taken into consideration, and the calculated values correspond closely to the experimentally measured values. Discussion: G. L.

Van Dorn, Ford Motor Co.; and G. L. Goldberg, The Budd Co. The paper discusses the stress analysis of a plastic model passenger car frame using road forces recorded on an actual vehicle. This test vehicle was instrumented to record suspension member forces and then driven over various durability routes. These suspension forces were then analyzed for instantaneous peaks, which were input statistically to the plastic model chassis. The model frame was stresscoated and strain gaged to determine stress levels for the various road profiles and vehicle maneuvers considered. The procedure for the actual construction of the plastic model and its environmental test fixture is explained in detail. The paper illustrates the ability to use plastic models as a design tool to provide feedback to the engineer. The information obtained in the test was not only useful in locating potential structural problems, but it also helped in evaluating manufacturing and ride development changes for design feasibility and cost efficiency. 710597. An Evaluation of the Fatigue Performance of Automotive Steels. P. Watson and T. H. Topper, University of Waterloo. A rapid inexpensive evaluation and comparison of the cyclic properties of three steels used in the automotive industry is presented. This evaluation ranges from the endurance limit through the transition life and low cycle regions to the monotonie results. Smooth and notched specimens tested in strain control and load control, respectively, provide data that are used to indicate notch sensitivity and size effects, cyclic strength and ductility, and cyclic deformation response. The effect of overloads on fatigue damage is given and prestrained smooth specimens demonstrate the possible effect of a few large plastic strain cycles on fatigue resistance. Overloaded notched specimens indicate reductions in life due to both large plastic strain cycles and the induced tensile residual stress. These data are suitable for direct insertion into the design process and also provide a broad base for continuing studies of cyclic behavior. 710598. Static, Cyclic, and Fatigue Property Correlations. Dewey G. Younger, Ford Motor Co. The results of an experimental and theoretical study relating to the stabilized cyclic state of materials and fatigue are presented. Using the power-law relationships credited to Manson and Coffin, excellent correlations are found to exist between virgin tensile properties and low-cycle fatigue failures for 2024-0 and 2024-T351 aluminum alloys, as well as annealed and hard OFHC copper. Constant strain-range fatigue tests up to a fatigue-life of 104 cycles under axial loading conditions at 3-15 cpm are reported. The elastic and plastic components of strain, as measured from stabilized hysteresis loops, are employed with the failure data to derive fatigue equations and the cyclic stress-strain envelope curve for each material. 710599. The Effect of Periodical Overstress on the Fatigue Life of Notched Aluminum Specimens. Alan F. Kessler, The Trane Co.; and B. M. Hillberry, Purdue University. The effect of periodic overstress on the fatigue life of notched aluminum (2024-T3) specimens was investigated at three different intervals and three different levels of overstress. Linear regression analysis was applied to the experimental data to obtain a model. This model shows the effect of the magnitude and interval between the overstress on the fatigue life. The model was used to determine the magnitude and interval that would give the greatest increase in fatigue life. 710600. Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Die Casting Techniques for Small Engine Connecting Rods. R. B. Weatherwax and Otto K. Riegger, Tecumseh Products Co. Research Lab. A computerized solidification model based on heat transfer theory has been developed for application to die castings to improve their reliability. The model was applied to a 7 hp small engine connecting rod to investigate the effects of uniform die temperatures, die temperature gradients, insulated coring, melt tempera- tures, and gate location on solidification patterns. The simulation results indicate that directional solidification cannot be achieved with reasonable die temperature gradients, but can be with a combination of proper gate location and die temperature control. The quality of the connecting rod casting was improved through an in- strumentation study of casting variables and by changing gate location and casting procedures as suggested by the solidification model. 1971 SAE Transactions 710601. Cylinder Porting for Small Two-Stroke Cycle Engines. Robert E. Frederickson, McCulloch Corp. A new method has been developed to die cast porting in cylinders for two-stroke cycle engines. Machining the 147</page><page sequence="83">710602-710607 148 ports has been eliminated as well as special deburring of port edges inside the cylinder. This cylinder has reduced the amount of distortion due to heat, permitting tighter piston fits which, in turn, improve starting and idling characteristics of the piston- valved engine. 710602. Multi-Cylinder Capacitive Discharge Ignition System with Solid State Distribution. David T. Cavil, Outboard Marine Research. A capacitive discharge ignition system has been developed which uses flywheel alternator magnets to charge a single capacitor. In a twin cylinder system, this capacitor is discharged alternately through two ignition coils - one for each cylinder. Timing and distribution information is provided by a separate magnet on the hub of the flywheel and a single magnetic pickup. This system is extendable to 4-cyl. 710603. Breakerless C-D Ignition as Applied to a Chain Saw - A Coordinated Design Approach. Elwin J. Brayley and Glen A. Guernsey, Wico-The Prestolite Co. Earlier design approaches to C-D magnetos for chain saws have been to make them directly interchangeable with their conventional counterparts. This, however, failed to make full use of the advantages offered by Breakerless C-D ignition toward optimum chain saw design. The approach described in this paper resulted in a simple four-piece system which is easy to install and service. Its simplicity greatly adds to its reliability. The improvements in this system lie in the use of a modular assembly with all of the ignition components removed from underneath the flywheel, a new approach to prevent the reverse running of the engine, and a specially designed step-up trans- former matched to this C-D system. 710604. Development of a Fuel-Based Mass Emission Measurement Procedure. Donald L. Stivender, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A calculational procedure is derived which expresses exhaust emissions on a fuel basis. Existing vehicle exhaust sampling procedures are utilized, together with fuel consumption data which are simultaneously obtained. Since no measurements of exhaust or air flow are required, the procedure is not limited by powerplant size. Emission values are computed in terms of grams per mode and grams per mile, as well as on "corrected" molar concentration (fuel) bases. Additional calculated vehicle developmental parameters include air-fuel ratio (carbon balance and oxygen balance), air consumption, dry exhaust volume, fuel economy, and combustion efficiency. Conversion of wet exhaust analyses to dry bases is considered. Actual mass emissions are determined for both the current federal seven-mode cycle and the 1972 federal test cycle. The observed, uncorrected vehicle concentratioń data, together with fuel flow data obtained by means of a digital fuel meter, are reduced by means of an on-line computer installation. In addition to tests of lean, catalytic, and rich reactor vehicles, this procedure has been employed for vehicles powered by gas turbine, steam, diesel, and hybrid ICE-electric powerplants, including some vehicles in the 1970 "Cean Air Car Race." 710605. The Characterization of Odor Components in Diesel Exhaust Gas (Report of CRC-APRAC- CAPE-7-68 Project). R. S. Spindt, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co., G. J. Barnes, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp.; and J. H. Somers, Environmental Protection Agency. The Coordinating Research Council and the Air Pollution Control Office of the Environmental Protection Agency have jointly supported the Air Pollution Research Advi- sory Committee Project CAPE-7-68 to analyze and identify the odor-relevant compounds present in diesel exhaust gases. This paper summarizes the experimental results obtained by Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute and Arthur D. Little, Inc. Both contractors found certain fuel fractions to be odor relevant. Many mono and polyoxygenated partial oxi- dation products have been identified, at least by structural class. These odorous compounds occur at very low concentrations in the exhaust gases. 710606. Emissions Study of Oxygen Enriched Air. W. J. Wartinbee, Jr., Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. An engine dynamometer study was made to determine the effects of oxygen-enriched air on exhaust emissions. Compared to operation with lean air-fuel mixtures, the results indicated that hydrocarbon emissions were re- duced substantially, carbon monoxide emissions were similar, and oxides of nitrogen emissions increased significantly. Octane requirements and fuel consumption were higher with oxygen enrichment. These emission and performance characteristics are due to the higher peak combustion temperatures associated with oxygen con- centrations of greater than the 21% normally found in air. 710607. Math Modeling of an Exhaust Reactor. M. H. Blenk and R. G. E. Franks, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Thermal and chemical processes occurring in exhaust manifold thermal reactors have been closely simulated with a computer model. The model has been developed to predict the performance of thermal reactors operating on multicylinder engines in vehicle service. Output predic- tions include both transient and steady-state response including reactor warmup at steady-state engine opera- tion. Gas and metal temperatures, heat fluxes, and concentrations of selected exhaust components can be followed as a function of time at various locations within the reactor. Studies carried out using the model indicate that for the chosen set of operating assumptions, combustion of</page><page sequence="84">710608-710613 hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide at steady-state operating conditions is limited by imperfect mixing of exhaust gases with auxiliary air. Most reaction was found to occur in the exhaust ports and inner chamber of the reactor with little additional combustion downstream of these sections. Optimum secondary air injection rates for minimum carbon monoxide survival were predicted for various operating conditions. Transient reactor response to a misfire condition was also followed through use of a model. This paper describes the features of the mathematical model, including description of the FORTRAN programs used. Development of the principles used in formulating the model, including both thermal and chemical consid- erations, are treated in detail.

Lang, Esso Research and Engineering Co. An experimental well-mixed thermal reactor system called RAM was devised, tested, and applied to several different size research vehicles. Low emissions were obtained because of the thorough mixing and quick warmup of the system, which was aided by flameholders. The study indicates that the RAM concept represents a significant improvement over previsouly proposed thermal reactor systems. Two versions of RAM were studied. One was operated fuel-rich to minimize NOx at the expense of fuel economy. The other was operated leaner and gave better fuel economy but less NOx control. The best emission results obtained were 3.7 gm/mi CO, 0.08 hydrocarbons, and 0.72 NOx. The fuel economy debit was in the range of 17-22%. Better fuel economy, in the range of 10-17% debit, was obtained at NOx levels of 1.9 gm/mi. Driveability was found to be good. Durability was not tested. 1971 SAE Transactions 710609. How Individual Valve Timing Events Affect Exhaust Emissions. Robert M. Siewert, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The effects of individual valve timing events on the exhaust emissions of a single-cylinder engine were deter- mined at part-load, low-speed, test conditions. The time of opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valve was varied independently over a wide range while maintaining the other three valve timing events at conventional values. Significant changes in the induction, combustion, and exhaust processes resulted from valve timing changes. Of particular interest are the changes in engine exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and nitric oxide under part load operation. The interactions between numerous engine parameters and valve timing are also discussed. Engine load, speed, spark advance, exhaust pressure, intake system configuration, mixture temperature, and external exhaust gas recirculation effects are included in this paper. Discussion: G. B.

The limited slip differential has become a favorite option among customers who demand improved traction capa- bilities from their vehicles. The traction performance requirements must be analyzed to determine what type of limited slip design will best meet the needs of the vehicle. The design selected must also satisfy the structural requirements of the other axle components and yet be producible on conventional axle manufacturing equip- ment. 1971 SAE Transactions 710611. An Unloading Cone Spin-Resistant Differential. W. G. Jeakle and D. R. Weilant, Borg-Warner Corp. This paper describes a unique limited slip differential concept that was developed by applying currently suc- cessful principles of limited slip technology. The differ- ential provides limited slip action under adverse driving conditions, but approaches a true conventional differ- ential action during favorable driving conditions. The design is applicable to any wheeled vehicle which uses a differential. In addition, the differential provides the basis for a new full time four wheel drive concept that provides satisfactory all wheel drive on or off highway. 710612. Max Trac - Wheel Spin Control by Computer. J. H. Moran, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; and R. A. Grimm, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. A new automatic electronic control system has been developed, which reduces rear wheel spin during accel- eration. This control, a miniature on-board computer, offers improved controllability and maximum traction under all driving conditions. 710613. General Motors Overseas Automatic Transmis- sion. R. P. Michnay, General Motors Strasbourg SA; and G. K. Hause, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. A new three-speed automatic transmission has been designed and developed for overseas vehicles. A unique arrangement of a Ravigneaux gearset, torque converter, three plate clutches, overrunning clutch, and a band employs new manufacturing techniques. The result is a low cost, lightweight transmission capable of covering a wide range of engine sizes. The requirements of the new transmission were: at 149</page><page sequence="85">710614-710619 150 least three speeds, flexibility to cover an engine range from 4 cyl, 66 cu in. to 308 cu in. V-8, flexibility for installation in left and right drive vehicles, small package size, minimum weight, low cost, and interchangeability of major components. This paper describes the design and manufacture of this new three-speed transmission. 710614. Torque-Biasing Full-Time Four-Wheel Drive for Passenger and Utility Vehicles. K. M. Arman- trout and W. M. Dick, Borg-Warner Corp. A four-wheel drive transfer case, that offers the maximum in mobility and control with minimum driver awareness and response, has been developed. The system is in four-wheel drive mode at all times. It contains a reverse cone differential with friction biasing characteristics for the purpose of relieving drive train wind-up while minimizing wheel breakaway and loss of traction. Design parameters were based on the concept of maximum performance within the limits of technology, mobility at extremes of tractive conditions, control, and cost. 710615. GKN Ferguson Formula All-Wheel Control Sys- tem. O. Webb, GKN Birfield Transmission Ltd. Preventing loss of vehicle control under drive conditions is analogous to, and as important as, the retention of vehicle control under emergency braking. Loss of control under drive conditions frequently leads to panic braking, which only aggravates an already dangerous situation. A four-wheel-drive system for passenger cars is described, having as its special aim greatly improved controllability under all road surface conditions. Reasons are given for splitting the torque unequally between the front and rear axles, and for employing two spin control clutches geared in parallel to the center differential in such a manner as to modify the basic torque split. 1971 SA E Transactions 710616. Bias Balancing Interaxle Differential for Con- stant 4-Wheel Drive. D. E. Hobson and L. J. O'Brien, Spicer Axle Div., Dana Corp. Limitations of current 4-wheel drive systems for hard surface operation are analyzed. Requirements for off-road mobility are studied and the requirements for a biased interaxle differential are defined from those requirements. The design and test of a biased differential which can be tailored to specific requirements are discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710617. Prediction of Temperatures Attained in a Diesel Engine Cylinder Head. Rudolf Limpert, The University of Michigan. This paper presents an engineering analysis of the temperature response of a diesel engine cylinder head. The temperature distribution attained in the cylinder head section located between the inlet and exit valve during warm-up and cyclic steady-state operation is computed employing finite difference techniques. Complicated boundary conditions, as well as the influence of the thermal state of the valves on the temperature distribution in the cylinder head, are incorporated in the analysis. Temperature response curves shown indicate good agree- ment between theory and practice. 710618. Effects of Mixture Distribution on Exhaust Emissions as Indicated by Engine Data and the Hydraulic Analogy. D. R. Liimatta, Ethyl Corp., R. F. Hurt, Bradley University; R. W. Deller and W. L. Hull, University of Illinois. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, engine data are presented which indicate how the three major automotive exhaust pollutants are affected by the distri- bution of the inducted fuel. Nonuniform fuel distribution prohibits lean engine operation without increasing hy- drocarbon emissions. Nitrogen oxide emissions are lower at a given fuel-to-air ratio with nonuniform fuel distri- bution, this condition being particularly true near stoichi- ometric conditions. Carbon monoxide emissions are lower with more uniform fuel distribution. The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate a new method of studying the mixing conditions that take place in an induction system. This method involves the use of a conventional water table, a facility to pictorially demonstrate the salient flow field characteristics, and mixing patterns that were encountered at typical engine operating conditions. Also, several different geometric configurations and their resultant flow patterns are included. Some of these configurations were duplicated in an experimental induction system and were shown to have similar flow field patterns. 1971 SA E Transactions 710619. The Scanning Electron Microscope: Its Opera- tion and Use in the Study of Engineering Problems. E. Eichen and G. M. Greene, Ford Motor Co. In the relatively short time since it has been developed, the scanning electron microscope has proven itself to be an instrument capable of aiding in the solution of a broad spectrum of engineering problems. This has come about because of the unique characteristics of this instrument. The theory of operation of the scanning electron micro- scope will be given. The manner of image formation and display will be discussed. The operating parameters of the instrument will be given. The types of specimens which may be viewed will be considered along with special sample preparation procedures which must be used for different materials. The different modes of operation of the scanning electron microscope will be discussed. These will include secondary electron, backscattered electron, absorbed electron, transmitted electron, cathodolumin- escence, and voltage contrast techniques. Means for obtaining compositional information about the specimen will be considered. Special instrumentation to increase the</page><page sequence="86">710620-710627 versatility of the work which can be done will be mentioned. Examples illustrating the different modes of operation of the instrument as well as the types of problems which can be handled will be given. 1971 SAE Transactions 710620. Practicability of the SEM in Analysis of Engi- neering Problems. Milton Draginis and Elma Lanterman, Roy C. Ingersoll Res. Center, Borg- Warner Corp. The scanning electron microscope has proven to be an invaluable tool to scientists in every field of endeavor. The knowledge of the morphology of materials has been increased greatly since the advent of the SEM. However, the instrument is also proving to be an essential tool for the engineer. Two specific examples of how the SEM leads to rapid solutions of engineering problems are discussed: the first example deals with a metal fracture, the other with the process of plating polymers. 710621. Applications of the Scanning Electron Micro- scope in Research, Manufacturing and Devel- opment. E. R. Cprek, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The light microscope and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) have been used for many years to study surface morphology. However, both of these instruments have limitations which restrict or prevent investigation on many surfaces of interest. Light micro- scopy is limited to surfaces which are smooth and flat due to the restricted magnification, resolution, and depth of field available with optics. High magnification and resolution are possible with the TEM. However, repli- cation of the surface is required. Such replication is tedious, time consuming, and costly. Repeated replication is often required to distinguish between true surface features and artifacts. Further, it is virtually impossible to obtain true replicas from surfaces having negative re-entry angles. Thus, morphology studies with the TEM often require large commitment of time and money and are, again, best suited to surfaces with microscopically fine flat surface topography. The features of the SEM which overcome many of these limitations are its great depth of field and its ability to view sample surfaces directly, without replication. Other useful features are a wide range of magnification and good resolution. Accordingly, the SEM offers new opportunities to determine surface morphology and its effect on material processing and part performance. 710623. Use of Scanning Electron Microscope for Study of Automotive Plastics. Harold F. Crandall and William D. Sigworth, Uniroyal, Inc. The scanning electron microscope is a tool which, when applied to the study of fracture surface, will assist the rapid and accurate identification of the source of a fracture. It is also useful in the interpretation of the structure and properties of filled polymers and multi- component blends. 710624. 1971 Cars and the "New" Gasolines. W. E. Morris, J. D. Rogers, Jr. and R. W. Poskitt, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). This paper deals with new unleaded and low-lead gasolines and their use in 1971 cars. It analyzes the fuel economy, acceleration performance, "knock," and various other important factors which must come under discus- sion in relation to the new gasolines. In most cases, the new gasolines do not fulfill the requirements they should. 1971 SAE Transactions 710625. Road Antiknock Performance of Low-Lead and Nonleaded Gasolines in European Cars. A. G. Bell and J. A. Keene, Shell Research Ltd., England; and K. Reders, Deutsche Shell A.G., West Germany. This paper describes an experiment designed to evaluate the road antiknock performance of low-lead and non- leaded gasolines. Over 100 test fuels covering a wide range of Research octane number, lead content, sensitivity, and front-end quality were prepared. They were then tested in nine European and one American car under both accelerating and wide-open-throttle constant-speed conditions. The design of the experiment and the analysis and interpre- tation of the results are described. It is concluded that, in general, in European cars, knocking at low speed road antiknock performance can be adequately described in terms of Research octane number, sensitivity, and front-end quality and that there is no additional benefit to be gained from the use of a high concentration of lead. By contrast, in European cars knocking at high speed and in the one American car tested, gasolines with a high lead content gave a better performance than the equivalent nonleaded gasolines. This was particularly so in the case of fuels leaded with tetramethyl lead as opposed to tetraethyl lead. 1971 SAE Transactions 710626. Forces and Displacement in Contact Area of Free Rolling Tires. N. Seitz, Metzeler AG; and A. W. Hussmann, Technischen Hochschule München. Of all the automobile safety studies made, one that has received much attention is tire design. Comfort, service life, and reliability have been the guideposts in the development of better and safer tires. The investigation of the forces that affect reliability is the subject of this paper, and emphasis is placed on determination of the param- eters at the particular area where tire and road are in contact. 1971 SAE Transactions 710627. An Analysis of Vibrational Modes of Vehicle Steering Mechanisms. Yasuhiko, Fujiwara and Miki Nakayasu, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. 151</page><page sequence="87">710628-710634 152 An analysis was made of vibration phenomena in the steering system of a vehicle when the front wheels have some amount of unbalance. The program included vehicle running tests and bench tests to ascertain some of the factors influencing vibration behavior. A mathematical model of the vibration system was simulated on a digital computer in as much detail as possible. The resultant understanding of the dynamics of the system as a whole led to an extensive theoretical analysis of selected key parameters. 710628. Generalized Tracked and Wheeled Vehicle Au- tomotive Performance Model. Joseph M. Wollam, U. S. Army Tank Automotive Com- mand. The mathematical formulations used to produce a gen- eralized computer model for tracked or wheeled vehicle automotive performance are presented. The report de- scribes a modular program where the modules represent major subsystems of driver, course, soil, engine, and transmission. It illustrates the manner in which the components are combined to perform a vehicle simu- lation, describes the capabilities of die model, and suggests improvements to be made in the modeling. 710629. Automatic Hardness Testers in the Motor Indus- try. F. Gartner, Maier &amp; Co. This paper describes the way in which a basic Rockwell hardness tester of special design (a so-called Emcotest unit) can be used to achieve various stages of automation, ranging from simple multipurpose automatic standard models to fully automatic hardness test stations integrated with long-run production lines. The scope of this article has been intentionally restricted to the field of automotive engineering, although the instrument is applicable to other branches of production engineering as well as to manually operated stationary or portable appliances. The latter applications are covered in the literature listed in References. 710630. Tire Traction Measurement on the Road and in the Laboratory. Walter Bergman, Harold R. Clemett and Narendra J. Sheth, Ford Motor Co. This paper gives a comprehensive analysis of tire-road traction, utilizing new experimental and analytical tech- niques. It introduces a concept of traction envelope for evaluation of the overall tire traction properties in all operating modes on a common basis. It establishes feasibility of laboratory techniques for tire wet traction measurements and shows good correlation between road and laboratory measurements and also between road measurements on different surfaces. Comparative eval- uation between new and conventional techniques for measuring tire traction on the road in cornering with and without power application are given. 1971 SA E Transactions 710631. The "Peter Principle" Applied to Mini-Comput- ers. Hans J. Kuschnerus and Robert S. Oswald, Ford Motor Co. Hierarchical computer systems are an effective way of combining the features of mini- and maxi-computers in automation projects. By distributing the functions in a multi-computer system, the mini-computers can retain the responsiveness and reliability of simple configurations while the more extensive information handling is per- formed by the larger host computers. This approach overcomes most of the problems found with independent small control systems on one hand and overextended, centralized computer systems on the other. This philos- ophy is illustrated with actual applications at Ford Motor Co. 710632. The Safety and Operating Characteristics of Big Trucks. T. D. Sherard, Western Highway Insti- tute. The "real world" of highway trucks operation sometimes differs from the technical world of simulation models, laboratory and proving ground tests and mathematical equations. At this time this is a matter of real concern. Federal standards now being proposed and effected appear to be based on the maximum performance-or greater-that can be built into a vehicle fresh off the production line. Generally speaking, when the truck or trailer comes off the production line it is, or should be, at the peak of its lifetime performance. Therefore, it is disturbing to see a trend, at state and federal levels, to impose new truck standards or standards even more severe on vehicles in actual operation, especially com- binations of vehicles whose individual units, even though adequate when tested alone, cannot, when combined, attain such individual unit standards-that is, without exhorbitant costs which will eliminate them entirely from the highways. 710633. The Base Pitch Concept of Involute Gears - Understanding its Usefulness and Interpretation. C. K. Reece, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. A new concept of gear specification, called the "base pitch concept" is presented. This concept provides an expla- nation of and aids in understanding the functioning of involute gear teeth in action. It provides the gear designer with a system for interpretation and analysis of the results of information obtained from standard involute profile charts. A gear drawing specification which eliminates unnecessary information is presented. 710634. A Computational Scheme for Matching Required and Available Power in Vehicle Simulation. Roscoe L. Pershing, Deere &amp; Co. Technical Center. A computational scheme is described that will adjust the level of forward acceleration of a vehicle to allow the desired utilization of a power system in a vehicle performing a task requiring transport motion. The scheme</page><page sequence="88">710637-710647 is computationally efficient in that only about three trials are required to find the match point of the power train and vehicle system. 710637. Application of the Scanning Electron Micro- scope/X-Ray Spectrometer to Automobile Ex- haust Particulates. Lois Settlemeyer, Dow Chem- ical Co. The advantages of using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to characterize automotive particles are described. The sample, collected using an Andersen sampler, is bombarded with electrons and the resultant x-rays are analyzed with an energy dispersive spectrometer. After many particles were observed, classifications were made for individual particles of one structural type greater than 3 ju, in size; agglomerates, single masses of particles less than 1 /¿; fines, particles of 500-1000 À; and atypical particles. It is felt that with the advances in methods and technology this procedure will provide a strong basis for future sampling, characterization and identification. 710638. Automotive Particulate Emissions and Their Control. K. Habibi, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Over the past 15 years, a large amount of effort has been devoted to the development of sampling and analytical techniques to measure the gaseous components of vehicle exhaust. Development of these techniques has been a long, time-consuming process, requiring definition of all factors that can affect accuracy, reproducibility, and the meaningfulness of the test results. In spite of all this activity, further changes and improvements in the test procedures are still being implemented. In contrast, the amount of activity spent in developing methods for determining the quantity and composition of particulate matter in vehicle exhaust has been quite small. There is, at present, no clear definition of what is considered parti- culate matter in vehicle exhaust. Further, there is no procedure for determining the total particulate emission rate from cars, or a defined test cycle for rating of cars. However, particulate emission control standards are being considered for 1975. The main reason for this lack of definition and procedure is the fact that sampling and measurement of exhaust particulate matter is a very complex problem, and systems to do this have only recently been developed. 710640. Epoxy Powder Coatings - Current Status and Future Trends. W. A. Riese, Dow Chemical Co. Thermoset powder coatings for metal decoration and other uses are the subject of this paper. The state- of-the-art in Europe and the United States are discussed. Uses of epoxy resin, its advantages, and disadvantages are reviewed, as well as the methods of application. The possibilities for acrylics, polyesters, and polyurethanes as powder binders are explored. Comparative costs of European and American operations are provided, and indications of the rapid growth of the industry are obtained from tabulations of consumption rates and expanding markets. 710641. Powder Coatings - Application and Recovery Techniques. Gunnar Beeth, Ransburg Electro- Coating Corp. Automotive technology is changing. Electrostatic powder coating is a fairly new method for applying finishing coatings. It is gaining acceptability in replacing fluid coatings. Today electrostatic powder coating is feasible in coating nonvisible automotive parts, parts requiring high corrosion protection, evening out rough castings and finishes requiring surfaces that are soft to the touch. Electrostatic powder coating of exterior automobile finishes is not too far away. This paper outlines the principle of electrostatic powder coating and general parameters in currently available electrostatic powder production equipment. 1971 SAE Transactions 710644. The Chemistry Industry's Role in Automotive Safety. W. E. F. Rupprecht and M. E. Winquist, Dow Chemical Co. The human factor will always be a deterrent to achieve- ment of 100% safety in automobiles, but new design and materials have considerably narrowed the margin of risk in highway accidents. This article considers the contri- butions made by the chemical industry in providing materials suitable for this purpose. Improvements in crash padding, hydraulic fluids, and gas tanks have greatly reduced injuries attributable to impact, fire, and brake failure. The close cooperation of the automotive and chemical industries is duly credited for these safety efforts. Emphasis is placed on the need for integration of inspection, driver education, highway design, and traffic laws with enforcing agencies in order to perfect overall in-use protection. 710647. Magnesium and Reinforced Plastic/ Composites in the 1970s - Compatible or Competitive? Thomas F. Anderson, The Dow Chemical Co. The production of reinforced plastic/composites is pro- jected at a 12% growth rate, primarily due to better public acceptance, low capital requirements, a wide range of fabricating methods, and technological breakthroughs. The properties obtained in RP/composites are dependent on types of resin, filler, and fiber used, with the type, orientation, length, and percentage of fiber being the key to its usefulness. Examined in detail are the methods used to fabricate fiber reinforced plastics and the effects of the various methods on the types of properties that can be obtained. In analyzing the competitive use of magnesium and reinforced plastics for lawnmower decks, price advantages were apparent in the use of RP, but product performance was unsatisfactory. The author concludes that comple- 153</page><page sequence="89">710649-710661 154 mentary use of metals and RP will provide means whereby products can be created that will satisfy the market best. 710649. Why Metals? Foster C. Bennett, The Dow Chemical Co. Thousands of alloy compositions have been investigated for use in automotive and other commercial applications. Zinc, aluminum, and magnesium die-casting alloys have similar strength properties. Data are presented on tensile strengths and thermal and electrical properties. Material cost comparisons are made for an average die-casting and an average unfilled molded plastic. Processing and finishing methods for pressure die-castings are described. 710652. Concepts Covering Water Pollution. A. R. Bald- en, Chrysler Corp. Efforts, made before 1960, to control waste seepage into our waterways are compared with society's attempts at this control during the past 10 years. Although many laws (two are discussed in detail) have been passed in recent years, they will not be effective until each individual becomes concerned and assumes his share of responsibility. Removal of pollutants is inadequate unless disposal of the removed pollutant avoids recontamination. Also, the importance of careful design of incinerator equipment and properly operated landfills must not be overlooked. 710653. Dollars by Eliminating Waste Oil Emulsions. R. L. Derby, The Dow Chemical Co. This paper will briefly outline the pressures noted by industry regarding pollution and operating costs, and the progressive developments which are being made to eliminate dumping metal working lubricants, and a decrease in operating costs. 710654. Expansive Imbibition for Practical Pollution Particulation, or, Separating Things from Stuff. D. H. Haigh and R. H. Hall, The Dow Chemical Co. Imbibitive polymer particles are quite effective in their ability to imbibe hydrocarbon fluid and vapors. Also, valuable inbibed oils can be recovered from the polymer by solvent exchange. It is evident that imbibitive polymer will not solve all our increasing pollution problems, but it may be helpful in solving some. 710657. Specifications and Tests in the Developing Coun- tries - Why, When, What and How. Robert E. Wallace, Dow Quimica Argentina; Jesse B. Vargas and James E. Miller, Dow Chemical Latin America. The world over and especially in the developing countries, the automobile has become a necessary addition to the way of life. However, it is hoped that the specifications and test procedures which are government approved and used widely throughout the United States and Europe will not be imported into the developing countries, since per- formance requirements for individual components and vehicles may vary widely from country to country. Therefore, closer cooperation is necessary between government, vehicle manufacturers, suppliers of parts and material in order to establish and coordinate specifi- cations which will fit the special needs of each country. 710658. The Allison AT-540 Automatic Transmission in Utility Truck Applications. A. R. Schuette, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. September 1970 marked the introduction of the first automatic transmission designed specifically for single- drive axle trucks and buses in the 10,000-36,000 lb GVW class. This new product is designated the AT-540 four- speed, fully automatic transmission. After the background on the development of the AT-540 is presented, the basic design features and general applications are defined. The considerations of the vocations in which it will be applied are then discussed as related specifically to utility trucks. This includes power takeoff requirements, vehicle per- formance, and installation. Verification of the compati- bility of the AT-540 transmission is presented with specific reference to the test program conducted, pilot vehicle operation, and production testing. The AT-540 has proven itself to be a durable, worthwhile component of vehicles for the utility industry. 710659. Design of a Horizontal Tree-Length Delimber. S. R. Hiseler, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. A horizontal, tree-length delimber, for coniferous trees up to 18 in. diameter at stump height, is under development now. This paper outlines its genesis, method of operation, and some general points of interest to persons in the logging field, without any detailed treatment of design theory or specific hardware in the machine. 710660. Logic Controls as Used in Logging Equipment. J. M. Ewart, S. Madill Ltd. With increased complexity of new equipment, introduced to the west coast logging industry, it has become necessary to reevaluate machinery control techniques. Proper coordination of clutch and brake application is very critical. The old methods of control are not adequate. Through the use of carefully designed logic systems, maintenance-free programmed controls may be produced to completely regulate all operating characteristics of the machines. The operator will need little training. His work will be simplified and he will be required to make fewer decisions. 710661. The Gas Turbine Engine in Small Craft. G. E. McClellan, Avco Lycoming Division. The lightweight gas turbine engine, which was originally a development of and for the aircraft industry, is finding</page><page sequence="90">710662-710671 inc^asing use in the propulsion of small marine craft. With the inception of this trend, problems peculiar to marine gas turbine applications soon became apparent. This paper deals with some of those problems and their solutions. 710662. Gas Turbine Fuel System Management. Matthew F. Winkler, Turbo Power &amp; Marine Systems, Inc.; and John F. Bacher, Nelson/Winslow Engrg. &amp; Mfg., Inc. Distillate fuels are well suited to gas-turbine operation for industrial and marine service. The industrial gas-turbine engine, unlike its aircraft derivative, has operated success- fully at high temperatures and high efficiencies on a wide variety of liquid fuels, including naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, burner and diesel fuels, and heavy distillate fuels. The dependable operation and long life of the gas turbine engine can be supported by the management of the complete fuel-handling system. The problem areas and the techniques required for successful fuel system oper- ation are discussed. Industrial fuel specifications are intended to indicate fuels for specific climates and anticipated duty cycles. Specific fuel properties causing reduced gas-turbine life, increased smoke levels, or decreased reliability must be controlled. Many of the flight fuel requirements are not needed for the industrial gas turbines; however, other properties must be specified. 710664. Recreational Vehicle Engines and Their Instal- lation. Harry I. Hazzard, McCulloch Corp. The subject of the engine for recreational vehicles is approached first as the selection and installation of the engine in units such as the snowmobile and A.T.V.s. This is to aid the vehicle's engineer in selecting and adapting an engine to his project. Then engine design is considered; particularly, McCulloch's balanced power engine with its mechanical balance system. 1971 SA E Transactions 710665. Technical Aspects of the Transition from Motor- cycles to Snowmobiles. Leo Lake, Yamaha International Corporation. Snowmobile use and environment dictates many me- chanical innovations in the cylinder, electrical, fuel supply, and drive systems. The end result, and the reasons behind each successive component mutation, are studied as is the present product; evolved by Yamaha from the more familiar motorcycle configuration and developed into a specialized engineering balance which satisfies a particular segment of our transportation system. 710667. The Snowmobile Suspension - A High Speed Motion Picture Study. James A. Newman and David J. Beale, University of Ottawa. A high-speed motion picture analysis of a typical snowmobile suspension system has been conducted. The bogie wheel system at the vehicle track and the leaf springs at the skis have both been examined as the vehicle traversed a prescribed ground profile. The technique has proven to be quite useful in determining the effectiveness of the suspension system. Several tentative recommen- dations for improving vehicle stability have been made as a result of this study. 710668. Computerized Preventive Maintenance - Is it Worthwhile? William H. Baker, Georgia-Pacific Corporation. The costs of truck maintenance record keeping can be significantly reduced by the use of predesigned computer programs. Sufficient maintenance detail may be recorded, classified, and presented in a manner which will enable management to make meaningful maintenance evalua- tions of their fleet. These programs can provide historical as well as current maintenance data on each unit within a given fleet. Data, initially recorded on forms by the individual mechanic or driver, is edited by clerical people and electronically recorded. The records are then con- verted into specific maintenance cost reports classified by both vehicle and fleet. 710669. The Maintenance Cost Iceberg. Fred Becker and Clifford L. Hayden, Mainstem, Inc. How effective and complete is the work being done in fleet garages today? Is the fault with management or does it belong to the manufacturer of inferior material or cost. This paper will attempt to show that a well designed management information system is a vital addition to the successful accomplishment of management control; also, that maintenance improvement and cost reduction may be difficult, but certainly is not unattainable. 710670. Manual Maintenance Data Collection System for Lumber Industries Fleets. Cecil D. Ingram, Boise Cascade Corp. Individualism is still the prime factor in any system. All managers tend to drift into establishing routines that work best for themselves. Unfortunately, these routines may not be compatible with other office requirements. Information needs to be compiled for all levels of management to assist decision making processes. Financial reporting to stock- holders, lending institutions, and governmental agencies is also a must. Practicality, cost, and time available tend to be limiting factors in satisfying everyone's data needs. Variation in the figures shown in this paper can be used to assist managers responsible for one to any number of pieces of equipment in the day-to-day activities. 710671. Some Effects of Fuel Injection System Param- eters on Diesel Exhaust Emissions. R. J. Hames, D. F. Merrion and H. S. Ford, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The products of diesel combustion, including hydrocar- bons, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and exhaust smoke are being controlled by current and future emission 155</page><page sequence="91">710672-710676 156 standards of federal and state governments. Fuel injection parameters, including tip design, injection timing, rate of injection, and the number and size of tip orifices were investigated with the unit injector, used in Detroit Diesel engines, for influence on these emissions. Results are presented to show control of hydrocarbon emissions by injector tip design. Reduction in nitric oxide emissions by changing injection parameters are limited by increased exhaust smoke and carbon monoxide and losses in fuel economy. Emission levels with the standard injector and an experimental injector, combining several injection parameter revisions, are compared to the 1973 California emission standards for diesel engines. 710672. Precombustion Chamber Diesel Engine Emis- sions - A Progress Report. R. E. Bosecker and D. F. Webster, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Precombustion chamber engines are among the lowest emission power sources available" today. Due to excellent fuel-air mixing and complete combustion, HD and CO emissions are extremely low. N02 levels are also relatively low because of the divided chamber "quench effect." Because of the low HC and CO levels, effort has been concentrated on lowering N02 levels. Retarded timing, inlet air cooling, through the use of aftercoolers, water induction, and exhaust recirculation have all shown beneficial results. Smoke levels are minimized by selective matching of engine and turbocharger to assure adequate air for combustion. 710673. The Effect of Some Fuel and Operating Param- eters on Exhaust Valve Seat Wear. W. L. Kent and F. T. Finnigan, Union Oil Co. of California. We are currently faced with the possibility of operating millions of passenger cars and trucks on gasolines free of lead whereas they were designed to operate with leaded gasoline. The studies discussed in this paper illustrate the potential engine damage in the form of exhaust-valve seat wear that could result from such a move. This work shows that the inclusion of phosphorus in zero-lead gasoline is not a complete solution to the exhaust-valve seat wear problem, but that as little as 0.5 gm of lead per gallon in gasoline can provide complete exhaust-valve seat wear protection under relatively severe conditions of speed and load. Comparison of photomicrographs of exhaust valves and exhaust valve seats run with zero-lead and 0.5 gm leaded gasolines permits speculation on the mechanism responsible for exhaust valve seat wear in engines fueled with zero-lead gasoline. 710674. Influence of Low Lead Fuels on Exhaust Valve Performance. William S. Giles and Stanley H. Updike, Valve Div., TRW Inc. An extensive series of tests has been completed to evaluate accelerated exhaust valve seat wear which occurs in passenger car engines with lead-free gasoline. Results indicate that the predominate factor contributing to seat recession is vibration induced relative motion between the valve and seat. Engine speed rather than load or temperature showed the greatest influence on accelerated wear. Various combinations of valve head shape including changes in seat angle, seat width, and valve head stiffness were studied. Fixed versus rotated valves, various valve materials, and face coatings and fuel additive evaluations also were made. Reduced valve seat angles and hardened seats showed the greatest reduction in valve seat wear with lead-free gasoline. 1971 SAE Transactions 710675. Octane Requirement Increase in 1971 Model Cars with Leaded and Unleaded Gasolines. H. A. Bigley, Jr., Gulf Research &amp; Development Co., B. D. Keller, American Oil Co.; and M. G. Kloppe, Southwest Research Institute. During the fall and winter of 1970-1971, the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) contracted with Southwest Research Institute for the latter to conduct a pilot program on 10 pairs of 1971 model cars to compare the influence of leaded and unleaded fuels on octane requirement increase (ORI). The cars were operated for 8,000-10,000 miles in the San Antonio area using a prescribed city-suburban driving schedule. One car of each pair was run on a commercially available leaded gasoline of 93 Research octane number (ON) and the other on a specially prepared unleaded fuel of similar quality. Differences in ORI for the two fuels ranged from 0-3.5 ON within car pairs. The average ORI of 4.0 ON for leaded fuel cars and 4.6 ON for unleaded fuel cars was not significantly different above the 80% confidence level. 710676. Unleaded versus Leaded Fuel Results in Labo- ratory Engine Tests. E. J. Fuchs, The Lubrizol Corp. A test program was conducted using a wide variety of laboratory oil and fuel performance test procedures in order to compare effects of unleaded fuel versus leaded fuel. These tests included standard industry-accepted procedures such as Sequences IIB, UIC, and VC, as well as procedures unique to the Lubrizol laboratory. Prelim- inary results which are reported in this paper will be subjected to verification in future tests. Initial results have indicated that unleaded fuel is more severe than leaded fuel with respect to varnish deposits, full throttle octane requirement increase, exhaust valve seat wear, and wear of certain other engine components. Results have also shown unleaded fuel to be less severe on rust deposits, spark plug fouling, and oil thickening due to oxidation. Sludge deposits were only slightly less severe with unleaded fuel, and the differences compared with leaded fuel, are not believed to be significant. The use of exhaust gas recirculation in selected tęst procedures has shown that suitably formulated crankcase oils can counteract possible detrimental engine deposits resulting from this anticipated means of oxides of nitrogen control.</page><page sequence="92">710677-710686 710677. New Swing Mechanism for an All-Terrain Back- hoe. Andy Brudnak, International Harvester Co. A new backhoe swing mechanism has been developed utilizing linear-acting cylinders. This design concept provides near constant torque and angular velocity throughout the full 180 deg of swing. It also provides for smooth cushioning at the limits of the swing stroke, and prevention against dynamic runaway load condition throughout the cycle. 710678.

This paper describes some features of the computer graphics programs featuring interaction between man and computer that are being applied to designing backhoes and loaders. Since the programs are mathematical models of general backhoes and loaders, some effort was extended to illustrate the use of this concept in analyzing a wide range of machines. Some sample output frames appear with detailed examples of problem types being solved. Specific engineering capabilities are enumerated and time savings estimates are given. 710679. The Effects of Serviceability. Robert L. Menden- all, Clark Equipment Co. All construction equipment manufactured today must be serviced and repaired. Proper selection and location of components must be a major consideration in the design of new equipment. "Serviceability" affects the customer, the dealer, and the manufacturer. Data concerning these effects, plus suggestions on some of the major factors to consider in the selection and location of components and methods of installing service items, are presented here in an effort to show the need for "serviceability." 710680. Maintenance Index - A Design Tool. E. W. Miller, Caterpillar Tractor Co. In the hierarchy of product effectiveness is one general area of design consideration that has avoided objective evaluation. This is serviceability, with its attendant subdivisions, maintainability and repairability. Most listings of design specifications refer to these areas without defining how the level of achievement is to be measured. This paper offers a heuristic method of quantitatively setting targets and checking for conformance in one area - maintainability - prior to and during the design phase. The method also provides a system to quantita- tively audit, or qualitatively compare, existing machines. 710681. Moldboard Plow Design and Use for Higher Horsepower-Lower Weight Tractors. Carl A. Reaves, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. A discussion is presented on the performance require- ments of moldboard plows. Advantages and disadvan- tages of designing for higher speeds of operation versus increasing implement width are given. Effects of plow shape and speed of operation on soil manipulation and force requirements are discussed. 710682. Utilizing Rotary Tillers with Higher Horsepower Tractors. James G. Hendrick, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. The special advantages of rotary tillage tools makes them compatible with many currently popular cultural prac- tices. Multipowered tillage tools are uniquely suited for utilizing high horsepower-low weight power units. Factors involved in the power requirements of rotary tools are reviewed, and the need for a study of high-speed soil dynamic parameters is presented. 710683. High-Speed Tillage Equipment. Laron Quick- stad, South Bend Farm Equipment Co. High-speed tillage equipment is discussed as it affects implement, tractor, and ground-working tool design with the benefit of increased productivity and better crop yields for the farmer. Implement draft is reviewed as a means which will allow higher speed tillage. Draft reducing studies to date, are reviewed with suggestions for im- provements in specific areas which show greatest promise. Implement designs for higher speed tillage are listed and improvement possibilities are given for tillage tools of the future. 710684. Historical and Current Developments in the Utilization of Tractor Power. Robert H. Caster- ton and Ober A. Smith, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. In tracing the growth of the agricultural tractor, past and current trends are examined in several important aspects of farm tractor design. Among these are vehicle horse- power, horsepower to weight ratio, auxiliary uses of tractor power, and operator environment and convenience options. A knowledge of trends in agriculture and tractor design strengthens one for meeting challenges of the future. 710685. Hydraulic Power Lift Controls and Power Util- ization for Larger Tractors. R. W. Wilson, Ford Tractor Operations. The paper supposes that the hydraulic power lift (HPL) will continue to serve as the basic mechanism through which control of mounted and semimounted agricultural tractor equipment is accomplished. The evolution of the HPL is reviewed, hitching theory and operating char- acteristics are synopsized, and some factors that will be required in future HPL systems are discussed. Finally, an analysis is provided of advanced systems that can potentially furnish types of control that will make feasible fuller power utilization in larger tractors. 1971 SAE Transactions 710686. High Field Speed Tractors, Why? James D. Wilkins and Richard N. Coleman, International Harvester Co. As the American farmer continues to substitute capital and technology for labor, his needs for more powerful tractors will increase. Utilization of this increased power 157</page><page sequence="93">710687-710697 158 can be achieved by the use of tools with greater working widths, performance of several combined operations in one pass, and increasing the field speed at which the various operations are performed. This paper explores some of the advantages (and disadvantages) of high tractor field speeds, first from the farmer's viewpoint and second from the engineer's or manufacturer's viewpoint. 710687. Proposed Availability Index for Construction Machinery. D. R. Longabach, Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. An SAE Recommended Practice is being developed for standardizing the quantification and/or definition of equipment availability in the construction and industrial machinery industry. Terms are defined, a test procedure is described, and sample calculations are illustrated. Con- troversial areas are listed. A brief history of the steps leading to the development of the proposed SAE Recom- mended Practice SAE J 199 is included. 710690. A Modular Cab for Farm Tractors. W. Ronald McKibben, Crenlo, Inc.; and Ronald D. Pitsch, White Farm Equipment. This paper discusses the design of the modular cab for the White Farm A4T tractor. The modular concept creates new problems in cab and tractor design and has signif- icant effect on tractor assembly line operations. The cab is particularly quiet and well sealed. Data regarding oper- ator noise levels are presented with comparisons shown to similar products and recent legislative activities in the area of noise control. Operator environmental control is improved with the modular concept, and performance data and specifications are discussed. The end product is the result of a close cooperative effort by the tractor manufacturer and cab manufacturer brought forth by the need to provide the customer with a greatly improved cab. 1971 SAE Transactions 710692. Tractor Cab Cooling Requirements. Harold B. Kreb and James E. Thompson, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. Increasing acceptance of tractor cab air conditioning is evidenced by the rapid population growth of air-con- ditioned agricultural vehicles. Both field- and factory- installed units made available by numerous manufacturers provide wide variations of system capabilities to meet various customer requirements. The present air condi- tioning state-of-the-art utilizing the vapor compression system supports manufacture of functional units of adequate capacity to meet most agricultural cab require- ments. However, the severe applications to which most off-the-road (including agricultural) vehicles are subjected in comparison with automobiles require some unique design innovations. Further development of system components to provide increased system reliability and durability will result in increasing customer acceptance and satisfaction. 710693. Development of ROPS Criteria for Construction and Industrial Vehicles. J. E. Staab, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Performance standards for roll-over protective structures (ROPS) have been developed for four classes of equip- ment - TTT, loaders, motor graders, and wheel scraper prime movers. The criteria were developed by studying the behavior of Roll-Proven structures in a laboratory and converting these observations into numerical relation- ships. The criteria establishes five major requirements: 1. Resist horizontal force - related to machine weight. 2. Absorb energy - must deflect without catastrophic failure. 3. Withstand vertical load after deflection-to machine weight. 4. Meet above requirements without entering critical zone. 5. Must perform at 0 F or material must exhibit Charpy "V" notch impact strength of 8 ft-lb at -20 F. 1971 SAE Transactions 710694. ROPS Safety Compliance Testing. Robert W. Weed and Hartwell C. Davis, Lockheed Pro- pulsion Co. This paper describes the static test of construction equipment Roll-Over Protective Structures (ROPS) as performed in accordance with the applicable SAE Recom- mended Practices. Details of the test facility are presented, including test fixturing concepts and pertinent design calculations. The heavy equipment tie-down methods and restraint systems are shown. Data acquisition accuracy and methods are described. Data from several tests are compared with data from SAE committee files. 710695. California's Development of Safety Standards for Heavy Earthmoving Equipment. Clifford W. Farmer, Dept. of Industrial Relations, State of California. California established the Division of Industrial Safety to develop and enforce safety standards for the workmen in places of employment. Many safety standards have been developed which included roll-over protective structures for heavy earthmoving equipment. When it is determined that a need exists for a new safety order such as the Construction Safety Order 1596, which requires roll-over protective structures for heavy earthmoving equipment, the Division thoroughly analyzes the engineering, edu- cation, and enforcement procedures and techniques as they develop the state safety standard. At the present time, the Division is investigating the need for safety standards pertaining to environmental control for the operators of equipment used in construction. 710697. Analysis of Pendant-Supported Latticed Crane Booms. Evart J. Vroonland, FMC Corp. The mathematical equations that describe and predict deflections and stresses in both the vertical and horizontal</page><page sequence="94">710698-710707 planes of a pendant-supported latticed crane boom are developed in this paper. The effects of configuration, structural weight, applied loads, and eccentricity are considered in the analysis. 1971 SAE Transactions 710698. Hydraulic Equipment and Controls on Excava- tors. Hans Dieter Knölker, Linde AG. Hydraulic working pressures up to 5000 psi are adopted by the majority of European excavator OEMs. Best output performance is then obtained when the high-power density is governed and controlled by skillfully designed devices and their characteristics and combination possi- bilities are fully exploited. A number of practice-proven applications are described and their effect on the working performance of an excavator is outlined. 1971 SAE Transactions 710699. Techniques for Structural Evaluation of Engine Components by Bench-Fatigue Testing. G. L. Lovestrand, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Bench-fatigue testing can be a superior tool for assuring that an engine component is an adequate structure, although it does not replace endurance operation of engines in laboratory and field. Bench-fatigue tests can be more effective; that is, easier, quicker, cheaper, more definitive, than stress analysis or nonfailure testing. The results of such tests and field experience can provide a valuable history. The capability of bench tests to make meaningful, accurate forecasts increases with sophistication and use. 710700. Accelerated Testing of Hydraulic Components. Robert E. Kay, Sperry Rand Corp. This paper discusses a hydraulic component manufac- turer's approach to accelerated testing of hydraulic system components for use on farm and construction equipment. Information gained through instrumentation of vehicles and vehicle manufacturers' input is employed to achieve a high level of hydraulic system reliability. 710701. Engine Fuel Rate to Computed In-Vehicle Horse- power. A. Byron Niles and William J. Gardner, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper describes an accurate instrument system developed to determine in-vehicle horsepower. Rapid measurement of fuel rate used in conjunction with a computer to factor in the brake specific consumption and other variables produces an almost instantaneous display of developed horsepower. 710702. Monitor Control and Its Application to the Grain Harvesting Machine. Frank H. Gardner, Inter- national Harvester Co. Monitoring is applied to the combine in two ways: engine and process functions. Engine functions are monitored by two modes of warning: audible for the critical and visual for the other important functions. Process functions are the critical harvesting speeds or volume flow. The operator is instantaneously warned by a function light and a warning wand if any of his monitored functions drop below the critical harvesting speeds. 710703. Electrical Remote Controls for Tractor-Imple- ment Systems. Dennis E. Schwieger, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. A new electrical remote control system has been devel- oped to solve an existing control compatibility problem in agricultural machinery caused by the trend toward larger tractors and implements and adoption of the tractor cab. This control system consists of a tractor mounted control box and one or more implement mounted actuators that provide remote monitoring and control of implement functions from the tractor operator's station. The control box and actuators are coupled by a multiterminal connector that has potential for standardization. This portable control system has value to the user in that it affords a new measure of comfort in more compatible tractor-implement operation. 710705. Electronic Overload Indicating System for Mo- bile Construction Cranes. William H. Jones, Eaton Corp. An electronic, fully automatic overload indicating system was developed and successfully applied to mobile con- struction type cranes. A minicomputer monitors the signals from boom load and boom angle transducers. It computes the resultant percentage of rated lifting capacity based on the crane's rating chart. A plug-in program card furnishes the safe operating limits from the rating chart. 710706. Electronic Load and Angle Measuring System for Tower Cranes. Martin W. Hamilton, Eaton Corp. While using a typical tower crane it is frequently impossible for the machine's operator to determine visually the position or movement of the crane's boom or hook. Electronic monitors have been developed to measure and display continuously to the operator the boom angle and the load weight. Included in the monitors are operator-controlled alarm systems to provide visual and audible alarms at any desired boom angle or load magnitude. Although application is described on tower cranes, the system can be applied to most types of cable or hydraulic cranes. 710707. Safety Signs for Agricultural, Earthmoving and Forestry Machines. James F. Arndt, Deere &amp; Co. Operators of machines used in agriculture, construction, and forestry industries can be involved in accidents due to inappropriate actions while servicing or operating the machines. It, therefore, becomes desirable to warn them of certain types of personal hazards when they are on or around machines. This can be accomplished with the use of a safety sign. For safety signs to do their job effectively, it is 159</page><page sequence="95">710708-710715 160 desirable that they be similar in format and design. Furthermore, they should be carefully written, appro- priately placed, and be distinctive on the equipment. 710708. The Hydrair II Truck Suspension. J. J. France and R. D. Star, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. Air over oil, oleopneumatic suspensions were first intro- duced into the WABCO off-highway Haulpak trucks in 1957. The Hydrair suspension system was developed to function as a soft spring and shock absorber for off- highway construction vehicles, providing better operator control, increased vehicle life, and reduced shock loads. This paper will deal with the development of the latest generation of this suspension, which is much simpler in design, has longer life, higher reliability, and still main- tains the desirable features contained in the original Hydrair suspension. 710709. Simulation of Sideways Overturning of Wheel Tractors on Side Slopes. Dennis Larson, Uni- versity of Nebraska; and J. B. Liljedahl, Purdue University. This paper discusses a mathematical model which predicts when a wheel tractor will overturn sideways. In addition to the usual tire and tractor parameters, this model also considers the slope, speed, turning radius, bump height, and side forces on the tires. The mathematical model predicted some overturns, which actually did not occur during experimental tests. 710710. Product Liability and Material Failures. T. J. Dolan, University of Illinois. Personal injuries resulting from the failure of a product in service often subject the manufacturer to severe legal liability. Legally, every engineer and manufacturer owes a duty to all others to guard against injury which may occur in any foreseeable uses of his product; if injury results a court may ultimately find the product to be "defective." The safety and reliability of all products demands improved methods and procedures for material selection, design, fabrication, prototype evaluation, and proper maintenance. In addition to using considerable ingenuity in foreseeing all possible conditions of operation in the use of his product, the engineer must make a critical appraisal of all possible failure modes to which the product might be subjected. Broad consi4erations must be given to the service environment (including the clumsy incompetents who may operate or use the product). Both in the synthesis of the design and in the development and testing of prototypes, detailed failure analyses must be made to evaluate the potential reliability of the product. There- after, a complete and logical analysis of each service failure should be made to determine the cause and prevent a recurrence. Valuable knowledge from prior failures is available in engineering literature from which logical approaches to design and prototype evaluation can be made based on prevention of failure rather than on stereotyped applications of codes and specifications. 1971 SA E Transactions 710711. Product Verification Tests on a Snowmobile. J. Lindley Smith, Outboard Marine Corp. Experimental stress analysis has proved itself to be a useful and valuable engineering tool that was used with design and testing programs on experimental snowmobiles to assure reliability. It also helped reduce the testing time. Design changes were made with an accurate knowledge of the stresses involved and in some cases were processed before endurance testing produced a broken part. V-belt sheaves were analyzed and strengthened. A high-tem- perature evaluation of piston material helped cure a piston pin hammering problem. 710712. Design-by-Computer. Arthur H. Delmege, Vick- ers Div., Sperry Rand Corp. Design-by-computer is a viable design technique for general engineering design due to the availability of large-scale digital computers for engineering applications. In the design-by-computer concept, the designer inputs the specified operating characteristics for the component or system to be designed and the program will output the dimensions of the design parameters required to meet these specifications. Hundreds of designs can be computed in minutes. This frees the engineer to improve his design method- ology, analysis, and engineering decision-making criteria. This is used to improve the design synthesis process of the design-by-computer digital program. 710713. Digital Computer Use in Hydraulic Systems Design. Robert L. Anderson, General Electric Co. Several examples of digital computer applications to systems analysis are given. A linearized mathematical model is developed for a small hydraulic system, simpli- fied and used as input for a prewritten computer program which produces data suitable for stability estimation. The same model is used in conjunction with a standard library program to obtain the step response of the system. A nonlinear model is developed and numerical integration applied to obtain estimates of the time function. 710714. Automated Tube Design Through Computer Graphics. John O. Nicholson, International Harvester Co. International Harvester Co. has developed a computerized graphics system of designing and fabricating tubing. The system will assist in the tube design, and will prepare detail part drawings, templates, interference checking drawings, and will generate fabricating data for tube bending. The procedure has reduced engineering and manufacturing costs while improving product quality. 710715. Arctic Operations with the Twister Testbed. William R. Janowski, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. The Twister testbed was operated on the Alaskan North Slope for three weeks in March and April 1970. Although</page><page sequence="96">710716-710722 the testbed configuration was somewhat removed from that required in terms of a "working" vehicle, it was believed that sufficient operating information could be obtained to develop an overall assessment of its potential. The trials indicated that Twister was capable of running over terrain typical to the North Slope at speeds three to five times faster than existing commercial vehicles. Twister's ride was substantially better when compared to existing vehicles. Although deep snow occasionally stopped the vehicle, the self-recovery capa- bility permitted the accumulation of 800 miles of test operation, of which 500 miles were cross-country, without any need for assistance by another vehicle. 710716. A Cold Look at Lubricants. R. R. McCoy and D. S. Taber, Mobil Oil Corp. The increased industrial and commercial activities in the Arctic areas of the world have led to the development of special performance lubricants to meet these require- ments. The technical requirements to meet the exigencies of commercial operation in the Arctic are discussed along with several lubricant approaches. The relative merits of the various types of lubricants including synthesized fluids, are presented together with the different areas of application. Discussion: G. K. Brower, International Harvester Co.; Authors' closure 1971 SA E Transactions 710717. Will It Run at 70 Below? A Progress Report on Arctic Winter Operation of Automotive Equip- ment. J. A. Miller, Chevron Research Co.; H. R. Porter and J. D. Lewis, Standard Oil of Cali- fornia. This paper describes special winterization aids and petroleum products that have been developed to make possible the operation of automotive machinery, on an emergency basis, at temperatures as low as -70 F. A package of five basic petroleum products appropriate for use on the North Slope of Alaska has served there successfully for several years at temperatures consistently in the -40 F range. The products may be blended on the site to obtain additional properties. The motor gasoline and diesel fuels developed for this package are discussed, along with the pour point and viscosity properties of Arctic winter lubricants - motor oils, ATF and torque fluids, hydraulic oils, gear oils, and greases. 710718. FAMECE and The Army's Concept of Prototype Validation. Nicholas P. Oglesby and S. E. Abrahamffy, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center. This paper presents a discussion of the Family of Military Engineer Equipment (FAMECE) and a new Army method, called validation prototyping, used to help in developing future equipment. The FAMECE system is described insofar as modules, intentions for use of the system capabilities of the equipment, and projected reliability and maintainability features. FAMECE has progressed through the planning stages of the conceptual phase; the major part of this paper discusses future development of FAMECE. 710719. Clark 675 24-cu yd Front End Loader. George C. Smith, Clark Equipment Co. Our market surveys indicate that large-quarry and mining people, many who own front-end loaders in the 10-12 yd size, are definitely interested in loaders of a much larger capacity. This is due, in part, to increased operator's costs and the need to produce material at a lower cost per ton. The model 675 with 24 cu yd capacity was designed with these thoughts in mind. This paper will discuss the design, testing, and special features of the machine. 710720. The Caterpillar 814 Wheel Tractor and 815 Compactor. James Svoboda, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Two new vehicles have been added to the line of Caterpillar wheel tractors and self-propelled compactors. The 814 wheel tractor is rated at 170 hp and weighs 41,000 lb. The 815 compactor is rated at 170 hp and weighs 38,000 lb. This paper deals with the steps that were taken to achieve the design objectives and presents a general description of the two new machines. 710721. Oils and Fluids for Hydraulics. A. S. Morrow, Shell Oil Co. The methods of refining and treating petroleum fractions and the selection of appropriate additives and inhibitors to obtain a satisfactory oil for hydraulic applications are reviewed. The various physical and chemical properties of these oils and their significance in hydraulic systems are also presented. In addition, a short résumé and state- of-the-art of fire-resistant fluids is given. 710722. A Component Manufacturer Considers Hydraulic Oils for Mobile Service. Richard L. Leslie, Vickers Div., Sperry Rand Corp. Mobile hydraulic systems traditionally operate under severe conditions in a wide range of climates. The component manufacturer's prime consideration in the selection of hydraulic oils for such service is the successful operation of the hydraulic system. Knowledge of his components and broad experience gained in their utili- zation emphasizes certain characteristics of oils that will aid the manufacturer in wedding the hardware into a system meeting the design criteria. Many types of oils, other than those specifically formulated for hydraulic systems, are being used for mobile hydraulic service. Among the more widely used are automotive and diesel engine oils and automotive trans- mission fluids. The major properties and characteristics of the fluids to be considered are wear protection, viscosity, fluid stability, rust protection, and filterability. These factors will be discussed in reference to their effect on component and system operation. The effects of various 161</page><page sequence="97">710723-710730 162 types of oils and their compounding are also to be discussed. 710723. Hydraulic Fluid Requirements - Construction Equipment. Milton E. Wege, Koehring Co. Through the years, the progress of the hydraulic system is increasing. Pump speeds and output volume increases, have increased the total oil capacity. As a result of this, the selection of an appropriate oil has become an important factor in the hydraulic system operation. This paper will endeavor to provide information to assist the hydraulic system designer in the selection of a hydraulic fluid, that is compatible with the various components in the hydraulic system. 710724. The Allis-Chalmers HD-41 Crawler Tractor. G. P. Koch, Allis-Chalmers Corp. The final production culmination of the HD-41 tractor represents an evolution of engineering criteria, design, testing, integrated manufacturing, and after sales-service techniques. It is also very representative of the engineering and technological challenges associated with the extrap- olation of unit size to meet the requirement for larger, more productive units in today's expanding earthmoving and construction business. 710725. Design and Development of the Transmission System for the Allis-Chalmers HD-41 Crawler Tractor. Robert W. Meyer and Wendell E. Richmond, Twin Disc Inc. Design features and development of the power trans- mission system consisting of the hydraulic torque con- verter, drive shaft, powershift transmission, and integrated hydraulic system are discussed in this paper. The hydrau- lic control system relating to the dump valve transmission clutches and the forward-reverse inhibit system designed for full throttle shifts without thermal failure is of particular importance. 710726. The WABCO 101-F Nine-Yard Elevating Scrap- er. W. E. Lott and I. L. Joslin, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. The elevating scraper is relatively new in the construction equipment field but is rapidly increasing in use and numbers. This is the result of its ability to excavate, pulverize, load, haul, spread, and to some degree compact the material without the aid of other supporting equip- ment. The WABCO 101-F scraper is a new unit in the 9-yd class which efficiently displays these abilities. Although a low-cost machine, it achieves unusually good load, haul, and spread time through improved elevator design and good power-to-weight ratio. Operator position is a new concept to improve visibility and comfort. Legally roadable, the 101-F is usable on a wide variety of construction jobs. 710727. Unified System for Compactor Performance Specification. E. T. Selig, State University of New York at Buffalo. A comparison of expected performance of the vast number of different compactors available today cannot be made using data normally given on equipment specifi- cation sheets. A unified system is presented for combining the essential information into expressions for compactive effort, productivity, and power requirements. This ap- proach is practical and may be used now by designers or users of the compactors, but further development of the system is also encouraged. 1971 SAE Transactions 710728. Analysis of Upward Soil Cutting. C. L. Należny, Westinghouse Electric Corp. Using the theory of perfect plasticity, upward cutting has been analyzed for very wide blades such as scrapers and for very thin plow blades. The results predict decreasing soil resistance with increasing blade roughness. The predicted reductions in soil-cutting resistance for a thin plow blade agreed well with observed reductions in forces with the upward-cutting vibratory plow in the Soil Mechanics Laboratory at Bell Telephone Labs., Chester, N. J. 1971 SAE Transactions 710729. Upward Cutting Vibratory Plowing. W. F. Bilotta and R. J. Boyd, Bell Telephone Labs., Inc., C. L. Należny, Westinghouse Electric Corp.; and R. E. Warren, Bell Telephone Labs., Inc. Upward-cutting vibratory plowing has been studied experimentally and analytically to determine the effects of blade shape, blade roughness, actuator frequency, and carriage velocity on instantaneous and average plowing forces. A lumped-parameter model was developed to simulate upward-cutting vibratory plowing. The model parameters consist of a mass, spring, Coulomb friction, viscous damping, and a parameter to account for upward cutting with different blades. Predicted and measured instan- taneous and average forces were found to agree well. The results of the study showed that a raked, wedge-shaped blade with machined grooves reduced the average horizontal plowing force by 98-99%. 710730. Polyisobutylene, A New Synthetic Material for Lubrication. G. J. Souillard and F. Van Quae- thoven, Labofina S. A., Research Center Petro- fina Group; and R. B. Dyer, Cosden Oil &amp; Chemical Co. A promising new lubricant for 2-stroke engines has been shown to reduce carbon deposits and to produce a smokeless exhaust hitherto not possible with mineral oil plus additives. This lubricant is polyisobutylene, a polymerized olefin, which is available in commercial quantities. The new lubricant, PIB, has been successfully</page><page sequence="98">710731-710746 demonstrated in various field and laboratory tests, all of which are described here. 710731. Application of the "BIA TC-W" Reference Oil to Air-Cooled Two-Cycle Engines. A. B. Weinberg, Cities Service Oil Co. This paper relates experiences of applying the BIA TC-W Reference Oil, designed for high-performance, water- cooled two-cycle outboard motors to high-performance, air-cooled two-cycle engines used in snowmobiles, all- terrain vehicles, outboard motors, motorcycles, lawn mowers, chain saws, and other equipment. Experience from field and laboratory tests is described. The per- formance of the reference oil is related to previous literature on two-cycle engine oils with respect to additive type and treatment level, base oil, bright stock, and fuel/lubricant ratio. The concepts of applying very- high-level amide type ashless additive oils to air-cooled two-cycle engines and predilution in the oil formulation are discussed in detail. 710732. A Review of Solid Lubrication Technology. Mahlon E. Campbell, Midwest Research Insti- tute. The function of this paper is a review of the solid lubricant technology. Emphasis has been placed on lubricating solids, bonded films including binder materials, and developments in the self-lubricating materials including plastic and metal-bonded composites. Typical uses of solid lubricants are cited. Design guidelines for use of bonded films and self-lubricating composites are outlined. 710733. The Use of Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication in Understanding Bearing Performance. Charles A. Moyer, The Timken Co. This paper is a survey introduction to elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication for the practicing engineer. A brief description of the theoretical background and experi- mental evidence of the EHD lubricant film existing in concentrated contracts as found in bearings and gears is provided. The influence of the range of EHD and partial EHD lubricant conditions on bearing performance and mode of fatigue is next explored. The evidence discussed is drawn primarily from carburized and hardened tapered roller bearings tested under a wide range of environmental conditions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710734. Effects of Transmission Fluid on Clutch Per- formance. C. W. Schade, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Of the many automatic transmission components which are sensitive to the effects of the transmission fluid, the ones which possibly have the most complex inter- relationship with the fluid are the clutches. Oil properties affect clutch performance, and clutch plate characteristics affect oil function. Several experiments designed to study fluid flow through a rotating clutch were conducted by the author. Fluid flow between a rotating grooved plate and a glass reaction plate was photographed. Viscous drag as a function of groove pattern was developed. An interface temperature as a function of flow was determined at various energy levels. From this information a general discussion is pre- sented which shows that the static and dynamic coef- ficients of clutch friction can be altered by changing the fluid composition. From this, in turn, the main point is made - that is, as fluid properties must be considered in the design of automatic transmissions and their com- ponents, the transmission user must follow the manu- facturer's fluid recommendation if optimum transmission performance is to be achieved. 710737. Selection of Hydraulic Fluids for a Complex Equipment Fleet. J. S. Ferrie and W. L. Saxon, Ontario Hydro. The widespread use of hydraulically operated systems in mobile work and transport equipment has increased the need for careful evaluation by the user of available hydraulic fluids. This evaluation has helped to reduce the number of different products recommended by the equipment manufacturers to a number that is reasonable for field use. Extensive laboratory testing and field experience, by Ontario Hydro has shown that two basic oil types, Dexron® ATF and MÍ1-H-5606B low-temper- ature aircraft hydraulic fluid, will meet more than 90% of hydraulic requirements of a large diversified fleet oper- ating at temperatures as low as -45 F. 710738. Efficient System Design and the Use of Elec- tronic Instrumentation to Find and Correct Inefficient Areas. W. T. Stephens, Gresen Mfg. Co. Inefficiencies in a hydraulic system become the heat problem of the system. The easy way to solve the heat problem is to add a heat transfer unit into the system. This cools the oil after the fact. The localized heat at its sources continues to cause breakdown of the oil and excessive wear on parts, seals, etc. In most mobile systems the heat can be reduced to a livable level without the use of coolers. Where a cooler must be used the cooler can be smaller, or the oil cooler, by making the system as efficient as practical. The use of electronic instrumentation can point up the areas contributing to the Btu buildup in the system and show the results of corrective measures. Instrumentation can also assist in reducing the vehicle horsepower requirements by the proper use of the available power. 710746. Producibility Considerations in Production Plan- ning for New Aircraft. Sofus L. Torget, The Boeing Co. This paper describes some aspects of aircraft producibility at The Boeing Co., and discusses the functions of Design 163</page><page sequence="99">710747-710755 164 Engineering and Manufacturing organizations in achiev- ing a producible airplane. The makeup and function of the product team prior to Corporate go-ahead, as well as their objectives and timing, are defined. Producibility aspects in both preliminary design and production phases of the aircraft program are identified and described. Specifically, producibility considerations during the preliminary design phase in the provisioning of facilities, subcontracting, and scheduling, as well as production-phase design verifi- cation, production planning, subcontractor coordination, materials handling, and plant layout and equipment, are discussed. The effects of design changes on producibility are noted. A discussion of design changes on producibility are noted. A discussion of motivation as a factor in producibility is included. 710747. Designing for Producibility: Design-Influenced Production Cost Program. Doyle T. Brooks, Jr., LTV Aerospace Corp. Whether or not a product is producible is largely determined during the initial design phase. Further, producibility can usually be measured in terms of cost, which is the approach in this paper. Presented here is a plan for tracking and controlling the end-product costs which are influenced by design decisions, while those decisions are being made. This is accomplished by creating accurate cost targets at the beginning of design, from base-cost modules established prior to design, then tracking the influence of design decisions against those targets, as the design progresses. The key here is the technique of rapidly creating the cost targets. 710748. Producibility in Design. George Petronio, Grum- man Aerospace Corp. Producibility, an input to aircraft design techniques, reduces production cost and increases product profita- bility. Concurrently with all stages of design, a joint engineering and manufacturing team continuously ana- lyzes fabrication methods and materials to minimize costs and optimize product performance. This analysis may strongly influence aircraft design. During design of the F-14 fighter aircraft, for example, producibility analysis permitted significant savings in weight, time, and money. 710749. Future Trends in Aircraft Design. M. Lynn Olason and Kenneth W. Hoefs, The Boeing Co. This paper identifies some future aircraft design trends by reviewing the projected traffic forecast, current transports and their potential derivatives, new technology, and some possible new programs. New airplanes examined include two versions (0.84M and 0.98M) for transcontinental and international use and a STOL version for short-haul operation. In addition, a special-purpose resource air carrier is discussed to indicate the degree to which an aircraft designer is able to accommodate unique require- ments. For each new aircraft, the purpose of the design and the associated technology challenges are discussed. 710750. The Crystal Ball Focuses on the Next Generation of Transport Aircraft. Richard E. Black, David G. Murphy and John A. Stern, Douglas Aircraft Co. Commercial aircraft market requirements are reviewed and all-cargo, STOL, SST, and CTOL aircraft types currently being studied are discussed. It is concluded that after the derivative versions of the present generation of wide-body transports have been introduced into service, the next all-new commercial transport will probably be an advanced technology CTOL. This transport must be quieter than present aircraft. An assessment is made of what technological advances are most likely to be incorporated in this aircraft. Supercritical airfoil tech- nology represents the most promising of the several expected technological advances. It can be applied to either economically increase cruise speeds or to signif- icantly reduce operating costs. There are, in addition, a number of interesting possibilities in structures, propul- sion and systems design. The characteristics of medium range aircraft, having cruise Mach numbers of 0.85, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.98, are presented. 1971 SA E Transactions 710751. Advanced Technology for STOL Transports. J. J. Cornish III, Lockheed-Georgia Co. From an analysis of a typical large airport and its growth problems, it is concluded that STOL aircraft systems are needed now - with or without high-speed ground trans- portation systems. It is also shown that the needed first-generation STOL aircraft can be in operation in 1975. These contemporary STOL aircraft will, however, be only a step in the evolution to improved aircraft of the future. The needs for technological improvements are discussed, and some new prospects in STOL technology are de- scribed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710753. FAA Certification and the Growth Model 747B Airplane. Ed Pfafman, The Boeing Co. The certification of an aircraft model is the culmination of many hours of effort by both the manufacturer and the certifying agency. A successful certification effort is dependent, in great part, on establishing clear channels of communication between both parties. Probably in no other human accomplishment is the need for effective communication so demanding in so many different fields of knowledge as in the certification of the modern airplane. The certi- fication of the 747B growth airplane is used as an example in this discussion of properly utilized communications. 710755. Development Status of the L-1011 TriStar. J. E. Hawkes, Lockheed-California Co. This paper discusses the development of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar jet and acknowledges its benefits to the field of commercial air travel. The plane is first described, with special emphasis on layout and advances in main-</page><page sequence="100">710756-710761 tainability and reliability. The flight test program and progress are presented, and various flight test technical- ities are discussed. 710756. The Airworthiness Certification of Concorde. Norman Harpur, British Aircraft Corp. The Certification of the Concorde SST has presented a new challenge to the manufacturers and to the Certi- fication Authorities in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America. Apart from the need to ensure, for an advanced type of civil aircraft, a level of airworthiness at the time of entry into service at least as good as current subsonic jets, many new technical and administrative problems have had to be dealt with. For the first time in aeronautical history, the Certification Authorities from three nations, together with an inte- grated organization of four manufacturers (British Air- craft Corp., Aerospatiale, Rolls-Royce, and Snecma) in two countries, have been involved in the drafting and application of new requirements for a new type of aircraft. The main problems, both technical and administra- tive, are dealt with in this paper, together with a brief reference to the current status of Concorde certification. 1971 SAE Transactions 710757. A Progress Report on the Development of an Augmentor Wing Jet STOL Research Aircraft. Hervey C. Quigley and S. R. M. Sinclair, Ames Research Center, NASA; Theodore C. Nark, Jr. and Jack V. O'Keefe, The Boeing Co. The joint development of an augmentor wing jet STOL research aircraft by NASA and the Canadian Govern- ment Department of Industry, Trade, and Commerce has progressed to the point that the design of the modifi- cations to the de Havilland C-8A Buffalo are complete and the engines are being tested. The predicted per- formance shows that the airplane will be able to take off and land in less than 1500 ft. Simulation studies indicate that the handling qualities of the airplane, with stability augmentation, will be acceptable for STOL research missions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710758. Air Force STOL Tactical Transport Technology Program. Randall B. Lo wry and Garland S. Oates, Jr., Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. An industry-assisted, state-of-the-art assessment of STOL tactical transport technology has been conducted by the Air Force. The assessment indicated that three turbofan concepts possessed the highest potential for satisfying the Air Force medium STOL transport mission. These concepts are the externally blown jet flap, internally blown jet flap, and mechanical flap with vectored cruise thrust. The Air Force has constructed a program to identify and fill the gaps in the technology, thereby reducing future system development risk. The program will also identify areas requiring future research. The program is in three phases, with the first phase primarily small scale wind tunnel tests, analyses, and ground-based simulation. Phase II consists of larger scale wind tunnel testing, critical component testing, and further simulation. Phase III is scheduled to be devel- opment of a technology demostrator vehicle. Inasmuch as approval has only been granted for Phase I, detailed task descriptions for only that phase are given in this paper. 710759. Design Comparison of Quiet M = 0.80 STOL Transports. Richard Scherrer and Robert Olson, Lockheed-California Co. This paper deals with a comparison, on a common basis, between quiet, point-design, turbofan, prop-fan, and turboprop intercity STOL transports as a means of possibly accelerating convergence toward a preferred system. Results indicate the high-speed turboprop aircraft is superior in terms of minimum gross weight, and, therefore superior in direct operating cost and ticket cost. It is probably also the safest of the three aircraft because of the greatest thrust margin and least thrust asymmetry during wave-off. 1971 SAE Transactions 710760. Propulsion System Optimization for the ATT. Gerald L. Brines, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Supercritical airfoil technology offers the potential of efficient commercial flight at or near the speed of sound. This paper reviews a recent internal study by Pratt &amp; Whitney to define the optimum propulsion system characteristics for a commercial transport designed to fly at Mach 0.95. The impact on aircraft gross weight of propulsion cycle characteristics such as bypass ratio, overall pressure ratio, turbine temperature, nacelle weight, and drag, as well as the important criteria of noise, is reviewed. In addition, the implications of flying at very high initial cruise altitudes above the majority of current traffic is discussed. 1971 SAE Transactions 710761. Propulsion System Requirements for Advanced Technology Air Transports. M. B. Schwartz, United Air Lines, Inc. This paper endeavors to identify some of the requirements for the propulsion system of the advanced technology transport. These requirements lie in the areas of design, material selections, accessibility and maintainability of the system, and noise and emission control. The design should provide for adequate stall margins for the compressor, maximum reliability, mechanical and operational sim- plicity whenever possible, and modular type assembly to facilitate on-line and on-wing maintenance. The airframe manufacturer must engineer the powerplant installation to provide maximum accessibility to the engine gas path hardware and the engine accessories. The engine designers must strive for noise levels within the state-of-the-art and preferably below the FAR 36 compliance requirements. The engine should be optimized to produce the minimum possible amount of noxious gases, particulates, and unburned hydrocarbons. 165</page><page sequence="101">710762-710769 166 710762. Installation and Integration of Transonic Trans- port Propulsion Systems. Lloyd T. Goodmanson and William H. Schultz, The Boeing Co. The chief motivating factor in airplane design, throughout the history of commercial aviation, has been increased speed. Significant advances in the supercritical flow technology now make higher speeds possible without economic penalties. Boeing studies in the transonic speed regime indicate that a family of economically viable transonic airplanes can be developed. The purpose of this paper is to identify some of the constraints imposed on an airplane propulsion system by transonic cruise speeds and to explore some ways to satisfy them. As the design Mach number of an airplane is increased above the 0.85 level toward 1.0, good airplane performance depends increasingly on careful tailoring of the propulsion installation and its integration to the overall configuration to establish a good compromise between drag, internal nacelle performance, and the practical considerations that produce an excellent air- plane. 1971 SA E Transactions 710763. Advanced Pintle-Controlled Motor with Thrust Vector Control. D. C. Sayles, U. S. Army Advanced Ballistic Missile Defense Agency; and C. T. Levinsky, Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co. The development of a motor combining a pintle-con- trolled nozzle with gimbaled supersonic splitline thrust vector control was undertaken in an effort to exploit the increased performance flexibility of a rocket system which is offered by thrust magnitude and thrust vector control, that is, the ability to perform widely different duty cycles, and maneuvers, or fly different trajectories. The major objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a con- trollable solid-propelled rocket motor which features variable thrust, attitude control, and high propulsion efficiency. To date, three half-duration motors have been static-fired, two at sea level and one which contained a thrust vector control at simulated altitude system. Al- though each of these preliminary tests experienced some difficulty, several of the most important design objectives were successfully demonstrated. 1971 SA E Transactions 710765. Development of the Algol III Solid Rocket Motor for Scout. Bernard R. Felix and Neil M. McBride, United Technology Center. The Algol III is a new high-performance solid rocket motor developed for use as the first stage of the NASA SCOUT-D and -E launch vehicles. The motor delivers a 30% gain in total impulse over its predecessor and provides a 35-45% gain in payload mass capability at a fractional increase in cost. Algol III has successfully completed development and qualification at United Technology Center under contract to LTV Aerospace Corp.'s Vought Missiles and Space Co., the SCOUT prime contractor for the NASA Langley Research Center. During this two-year program two development and three qualification motors were successfully static-tested. The motor is 45 in. in diameter, has a length-to-diameter ratio of 8:1, and delivers an average of 100,000 lb of thrust for an action time of 72 sec. The motor design features a very high volumetrically loaded internal-burning-charge design of 17% aluminized composite polybutadiene propellant, a plasma-welded and heat-treated 4130 steel alloy case, and an all-ablative plastic nozzle liner enclosed in a steel shell. The only significant development problem encountered was tailoring the grain design to account for erosive burning effects produced in the high length-to-diameter ratio, high subsonic mach number port. In this paper, the program development results will be presented, together with design descriptions and fabrication methods for each of the major components. 1971 SA E Transactions 710766. Solid Propellant Micromotors and Impulsive Thrusters. Leonard H. Caveny and Martin Summerfield, Princeton University. Lightweight solid propellant motors which supply high thrusts (&gt;500 lbf) for durations on the order 0.010 sec (referred to as impulsive thrusters) require special analysis of items such as internal ballistics, propellant combustion, ignition stimuli, and inert hardware. An almost explosive ignition and pressurization coupled with the requirements for reproducible thrust versus time programs are analyzed by a mathematical model that emphasizes gas flow and propellant combustion dynamics. To further reduce impulsive thruster operating times, limitations in propel- lant burning rate must be circumvented by departures from conventional internal burning, thin propellant web motor designs. A novel approach that uses a dense, porous propellant is described in terms of a recently developed combustion theory for porous propellants. 710767. On-Off and Acceleration Control of Solid Rock- ets. Allan J. McDonald, Thiokol Chemical Corp. In order to improve the effectivity of rocket propulsion systems, thrust control has been employed. As a result, liquid bipropellant engines have been selected for oper- ational propulsion systems for these advanced missiles. Controllable solid rocket motor technology programs conducted over the past 5-6 years have provided several promising controllable solid rocket motor concepts to accomplish these same complex missions previously assigned to liquid systems. This paper discusses many of these controllable solid rocket motor concepts, their advantages and disadvantages, and potential applications for this technology. 1971 SAE Transactions 710769. Performance of a 10 Millipound Biowaste Resist- ojet. D. G. Phillips, The Marquardt Co. The 10-mlb thrust, concentric-tubes resistojet, which was life tested on hydrogen and ammonia propellants for 8000 hours, is being developed for use with biowaste propel-</page><page sequence="102">710770-710776 lants. Thrusting performance is presented for H2, H20, CH4, and C02 as well as typical biopropellant mixtures (C02-CH4, H20-CH4 and C02-H2). Using Pt-Ir alloy heater tubes, 235 and 575 seconds were obtained for water and hydrogen propellants. Overall total power efficiencies were 66% which includes losses for a pre-evaporator close-coupled for the water tests. Vibration to 1.0 g2/Hz with an overall G rms of 36, shock at 30 g's and acceleration to 8 g's simulating a launch were passed by the thruster. 710770. A Propulsion System for Orbit-to-Orbit Shuttle. W. W. Wells, Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab., Edwards AFB; and E. A. Lamont, Rocke t- dyne/North American Rockwell Corp. This paper describes an advanced development program for the demonstration of the aerospike rocket engine system. This three- task, 31 -month program consists of the analytical and design studies to be accomplished under Task I; aerospike thrust chamber experimental segment testing to be accomplished under Task II; and demon- stration of the full aerospike thrust chamber to be accomplished under Task III. The program is being conducted at Rocketdyne, a division of North American Rockwell Corp., under the sponsorship of the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab. under Contract F046 11-67- C-0116. This paper summarizes the accomplishments of the program to date, and describes the engine system and its possible application to the orbit-to-orbit shuttle. 1971 SAE Transactions 710771. Graphite Fan Blade Development. Bernard L. Koff, General Electric Co. Design studies supported by laboratory test data have shown that graphite fiber composite fan blades in subsonic turbofan engines offer significant potential reductions in weight for both the fan rotor and con- tainment structure as well as reduced sensitivity to fatigue failure from foreign object damage. However, substantial progress in the application of composite material tech- nology including mechanical properties, design, devel- opment, processing, and inspection methods must be accomplished in order to realize these potential im- provements over conventional titanium fan blade mate- rials. Turbofan aircraft engines are subjected to foreign object impact by birds, ice balls, ice slabs, rocks, sand, rain, and miscellaneous objects like blown tire treads, in addition to operation with inlet distortion. Graphite composite blades must be designed to tolerate these types of damage and still produce power comparable to current engines before they can seriously be considered for flight applications. In 1969, the General Electric Company selected a high-bypass engine as the test vehicle for initial appli- cation of graphite fiber composite fan blades. A two-phase design, manufacturing and development program was initiated to produce a graphite composite first stage fan rotor suitable for flight application. The first phase of this program, completed in 1970, was directed toward iden- tifying the problems and producing graphite composite fan blades for engine test evaluation with unshrouded titanium blades in the same rotor. This report presents a status summary of the com- posite fan blade design, manufacturing and development effort including the results of the crosswind engine testing of these blades at General Electric's engine test facility at Peebles, Ohio. 710772. Boron/Polyimide Fan Blades - A Fabrication Study. Ira Petker, Structural Composites Indus- tries, Inc., W. Donald Holmes, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft; and Gerald A. Lunde, Structural Composites Industries, Inc. The materials and processes developed for the fabrication of a fan blade constructed with boron fibers and polyimide matrix are described. Mechanical properties of the material system between -65 and 500 F are given in graphical and tabular form. Some blade properties, including the effect of ply orientation on resonant frequency, fatigue performance, and untwist, are also given. Finally, the result of cost projections for blades of this type indicates that it has high potential to be manufactured competitively. 710774. The NASA Quiet Engine. James J. Kramer, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The NASA Quiet Engine Program will incorporate all available noise-reduction technology into a propulsion system suitable for subsonic civil transport aircraft. Full-scale experimental hardware is being built and tested primarily for noise performance. The program is in process, and component tests to date indicate that it is possible to achieve or exceed noise reduction objectives of 15-20 PNdB below the levels of 707/DC-8 long-range transport aircraft. 710775. Olympus 593 Powerplant in Concorde. P. H. Calder, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. Most of the important technical aspects of the two prototype Concordes and of their Olympus 593 power- plants have been explored and the aeroplanes are flying regularly at Mach 2.0 over long distances. The current status of the powerplant performance, further perform- ance development, the engine and intake control systems, the reheat and exhaust systems, engine/intake devel- opment program, the environment and service experience, are reviewed. Convincing performance demonstrations have been made and active discussions with airlines are in hand regarding production versions of the aeroplane. 710776. Design Features of the Garrett ATF3 Turbofan Engine. Robert R. Van Nimwegen, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. A new approach in the design of small turbofan aircraft propulsion engines is directed toward providing executive type aircraft with coast-to-coast capability. The Garrett 167</page><page sequence="103">710777-710785 168 ATF3 turbofan engine employs a unique three-spool design concept using advanced component technology, provides an efficiency comparable to the largest turbofan engines, has low emissions, and is easily maintained. 710777. The Influence of Powerplant Design on Airplane Operational Effectiveness - The Operator's Point of View. J. R. Wilcox, American Airlines. During development of the jumbo tri-jet and its power- plant installation, a new concept in cooperative design was established. This concept organized the airframe and engine manufacturers' and operators' representatives into a single team with the objective of producing a powerplant installation with an operational effectiveness in keeping with the mission of the jumbo tri-jet aircraft. 710778. Team Approach to Powerplant Design for Max- imum Operational Effectiveness. L. A. Wright, McDonnell Douglas Corp. A new concept of intimate customer participation evolved during the design, development, and test phases of the DC- 10 propulsion system. This concept was resolved into the Airline Propulsion Team approach which took full advantage of the unique contributions to design available from the customer. The design of the DC- 10 propulsion system incorporates customer contributions based on his experience and expertise in such areas as operation, maintenance, and overhaul. This paper discusses the methods and operation of the Airline Propulsion Team as well as the immediate and projected benefits resulting from customer participation. 710779. The CF6 Engine - Designed to Improve Opera- tional Effectiveness. R. W. Hevener, General Electric Co. The advanced technology concepts offered by the CF6 over previous-generation gas turbine engines in regard to performance, operational characteristics, environmental considerations, dispatch reliability and utilization, and heavy maintenance have been incorporated to improve overall airplane operational effectiveness. The success of these concepts is being evidenced in the flight operation of the DC- 10 airplane. 1971 SAE Transactions 710780. Dynamic Analysis of Large-Scale Systems. Rich- ard Rosen and Moshe F. Rubinstein, Mechanics Research, Inc. Analytical and numerical techniques applicable to the dynamic analysis of structural systems are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the methods employed by the computer codes that are available to the engineering community. The solution methods treated are direct integration, normal mode method, and component mode synthesis. The different computer techniques for the solution of simultaneous linear equations and the use that is made of them by several available computer codes are discussed. 710781. Bond Graph Methods in Structural Dynamics. Dean Karnopp, University of California. A series of examples, involving normal mode represen- tations of a flexible railcar and various suspension models, is presented illustrating the use of bond graph techniques for assembling a structural dynamic system model from component models. Bond graph techniques are related to other methods for achieving the same goal, and the unique features of bond graph techniques are point out. Not only does the bond graph provide a graphical representation of the organized system equations, but also it allows the use of ENPORT programs for automating the process of manipulating the component relations into an explicit- state space format suitable for simulation or analysis. Nonlinear and active systems which interact with struc- tural dynamic components are readily handled using bond graph techniques. 710783. A Survey of Modal Synthesis Methods. Gary C. Hart, Walter C. Hurty and Jon D. Collins, J. H. Wiggins Co. Several modal synthesis procedures for the dynamic analysis of large composite structural systems are sur- veyed. The matrix formulation of the free-free modal synthesis procedures is presented. Also given are sche- matic flow charts of the analysis procedure used in three prominent methods. The advantages and disadvantages of several modal synthesis methods for different classes of structural problems are presented in order to enable the engineer to select the best procedure for his particular type of problem. 1971 SAE Transactions 710784. Use of a Reduced System of Generalized Coor- dinates in a Direct-Iterative Eigensolution Tech- nique. Joseph A. Wolf, Jr. and Stanley B. Dong, University of California, Los Angeles. An efficient algebraic eigensolution technique is presented for the simultaneous determination of a set of the lowest frequencies and modal patterns of a structural system. The scheme utilizes a number of reduced generalized coordinates for collapsing the original eigensystem down to a much smaller size and a Stodola-Vianello iteration is employed for the convergence of the eigendata. This technique is then extended for obtaining frequencies and mode shapes in the intermediate to higher frequency ranges. A special application of this extension is given for the frequencies and mode shapes of a free-free structure. Selected examples in structural and continuum dynamics are given to illustrate this technique. 1971 SAE Transactions 710785. Statistical Analysis of the Modal Properties of Large Structural Systems. Jon D. Collins, Gary C. Hart and Bruce Kennedy, J. H. Wiggins Co. A theory is developed to predict eigenvalue and eigen- vector uncertainty in large dynamic models. The uncer- tainty is based on physical property uncertainty and</page><page sequence="104">710786-710793 should not be confused with numerical roundoff, although the method can be extended to include the latter. The theory, when implemented on a computer, is used to analyze the uncertainties in frequencies and mode shapes based on uncertainties in mass, stiffness, modulus of elasticity, etc. The method incorporates a linear statistical model which is quite adequate for handling property uncer- tainties of 10% or more. The model is not limited to small systems but uses certain statistical assumptions as well as selective matrix manipulations to keep the size of all matrix operations to within the number of degrees of freedom of the system. Examples are given for two longitudinal vibration problems, and the results are supported by a Monte Carlo analysis. 710786. Dynamic Analysis of Structures with Random Properties by Component Mode Synthesis. T. K. Hasselman, TRW Systems, Inc.; and Gary C. Hart, University of California, Los Angeles. This paper presents a method for computing the statistical variance of eigenvalues and eigenvectors by component mode synthesis. The method relies on a modal summation to obtain eigenvector derivatives where the contributions of individual modes are shown to diminish in importance as their natural frequencies become further separated from that of the eigenvector being differentiated. The convergence of mean eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and their standard deviations, is evaluated as the number of component modes used in the synthesis is increased. It is found that convergence proceeds in that order, with the standard deviations of eigenvectors requiring the largest number of modes for convergence. However, numerical investigations have shown that even the standard devia- tions of eigenvectors tend to converge for the first several system modes, when only a small fraction of the total number of component modes are taken into account. The dependence of convergence on the distribution of ran- domness and its spatial correlation is also discussed. 710787. Synthesis of Stiffness and Mass Matrices from Experimental Vibration Modes. Ronald G. Ross, Jr., California Institute of Technology. With highly complex structures, it is sometimes desirable to derive a dynamic model of the system from experi- mental vibration data. This paper presents algorithms for synthesizing the mass and stiffness matrices from exper- imentally derived modal data in a way which preserves the physical significance of the individual mass and stiffness elements. The synthesizing procedures allow for the incorporation of other mass and stiffness data, whether empirical or based on the analyst's insight. The mass and stiffness matrices are derived for a cantilever beam example and are compared with those obtained using earlier techniques. 1971 SA E Transactions 710789. Standing Wave Phenomena Relating to Ultra- sonic Bonding Tips. S. Z. Dushkes, IBM Corp. This paper analyzes the required geometry of a tapered tip that terminates the amplifying horn used for ultrasonic bonding of fine wires to small electronic circuit boards. Nearly all the published literature on the ultrasonic bonding power train is concerned with the amplifying horn rather than with the bonding tip. The new appli- cation of the ultrasonic bonding technique described here is for circuit boards of extremely high wire density, where the slender bonding tip must penetrate the circuit network to bond a wire to a pad without disturbing the neigh- boring bonds. 1971 SA E Transactions 710791. Adhesives for Microelectronics. Herbert S. Kraus, Ablestik Labs. The use of improper adhesives has created many serious problems in microelectronic applications. The author discusses the more significant problems and briefly describes a unique family of adhesive preforms specif- ically designed to eliminate these problems. 710792. Survival in Metallization Burnout. Brian M. Moriarty, Litton Systems Inc. Electronic systems must be able to withstand certain radiation environmental stresses which could potentially result in significant transient currents to its semicon- ductors. The reliability of integrated circuits is dependent upon the overstress to which they are exposed in operation. Overstress of the integrated circuits in the form of metallization burnout causes openings in the inter- connection paths leading to failure of the connected circuitry. This study seeks to identify the failure mecha- nism with its corresponding thresholds and magnitude of currents as well as to identify a probability of survival number for the threshold condition. 710793. The Use of Cobalt in Plated Copper to Inhibit The Formation of Brittle Copper-Tin Inter- metallic Compounds at the Copper-Solder Inter- face on Printed Circuit Boards. J. E. Breen, E. Toledo and V. White, Raytheon Co. The formation of copper-tin intermetallic compounds of the Cu6Sn5 and the Cu3Sn type at the interface between copper and solder on printed circuit (PC) boards has been previously documented, as have the circumstances under which these brittle layers can cause peeling of the solder and greatly reduce the solderability of the PC boards shown. The formation of these intermetallic layers is caused by diffusion, mainly of the copper into the solder, and is a function of time and temperature. Inhibiting the diffusion will inhibit the formation of the intermetallics. Several methods have been tried, such as the use of a metallic barrier layer. This paper will show that one of the more successful methods is the code- 169</page><page sequence="105">710797-710813 170 positing of small amounts of cobalt (0.05-0.5%) with the copper. This process is similar to the use of cobalt in wrought copper alloys to reduce solid-state mobility during thermal processes. These small amounts of cobalt do not reduce the solderability, increase the difficulty of achieving sound plated through holes, or react differently to standard etching solutions than pure copper. 1971 SA E Transactions 710797. Fabrication of Multilayer Ceramic Interconnec- tion Boards. Elliott A. Kasten, North American Rockwell Microelectronics Co. The basic produced for fabricating ceramic multilayer boards, for use with beam lead, flip chip, or flying lead semiconductor devices is described. 710798. Screening and Analysis of Integrated and MSI Circuits. Matteo D. Gallo, Raytheon Co. The use of integrated circuits (ICs) in the design of electronics is a popular and growing trend. Meanwhile, the manufacture of the IC devices is a very competitive business, and each producer establishes levels of quality in his product which will enable him to make a profit. If, as a result of the profit motive, the vendor's standards for reliability in his ICs are low, and if his quality-control screening before shipment is held to a minimum, the price of the units can be made very attractive to users. The systems manufacturer, however, finds his savings in initial cost canceled by failures of the devices after installation in the larger equipment. Systems producers, in increasing numbers, are being forced to set up their own incoming inspection facilities to weed out potential and actual failures before the semiconductor units are used. The large equipment manufacturer must balance the costs of test-screening all ICs before installation against the degree of deficiencies expected in shipments of unchecked units. He may then set up an inspection and test facility, which can vary in size from simple, semiautomatic IC checking equipment to a fully (and expensively) equipped analysis laboratory. Examinations by the user of failed integrated circuit devices should include leak testing, curve tracer analysis, d-c-verification testing, dynamic testing, and radiographic inspection. From our experience, the predominant failures observed encompass: wire and bonding, metallization, and photolithographic defects, with a smaller percentage of surface, packaging, and marking deficiencies. 710799. Computerized Control of Thick-Film Resistor Parameters. Phillip E. Kenney, Ledex Micro- electronics. Control of thick-film resistor parameters requires a substantial amount of data to be measured and calculated. The computer is an invaluable tool for saving time and errors in testing resistor materials. How the computer is used for control of resistor materials and its availability to companies of all sizes is the theme of this paper. 710800. Automatic Assembly-Axial Lead Components. John Westling, Honeywell Information Systems. During the last three years, the development in hardware used for automatic assembly of printed circuit boards has progressed tenfold over the previous decade. The im- provements have created a strong justification for auto- mation, but have also placed the actual hardware far down the list of important considerations when im- plementing an automated process. The areas gaining in relative importance are those of circuit board design, circuit board and component volume, inventory control, and, of course, the actual costs of manual versus automatic assembly.

Control of Warpage During Machining. Charles L. Bennett, Convair Aerospace Div., General Dynamics Corp. The increased use of large aluminum-alloy forgings for structural components of the jumbo jet air transport brought attention to bear on the costly distortion problem associated with machining these forgings. This paper discusses one warpage problem - the floor beam - and its solution. Investigation showed that dis- tortion is due primarily to the relief of residual quenching stresses by machining, and that the amount of distortion depends upon the magnitude, distribution, and locations of these stresses within the part. Control of this condition and improved packing and storage methods resulted in a greatly reduced distortion incidence. 1971 SA E Transactions 710802. A Thin Film Metallization System for Various Assembly Techniques. Harold E. Waufle, Hughes Aircraft Co. This paper describes a thin film metallization system using nichrome-nickel-gold on alumina substrates. The system meets the specifications of several company hybrid microelectronic facilities. The capabilities and overall reliability of the deposition system is discussed in relation to the various assembly techniques by these facilities to produce high reliable circuits. 710813. Lube Oil Filtration Effect on Diesel Engine Wear. J. L. Butler, J. P. Stewart and R. E. Teasley, Cummins Engine Co. A series of comparative evaluation tests to determine the effect of various full-flow and combination full-flow and bypass filter systems on diesel engine piston ring and crankshaft bearings were made using radioactive tracer wear measurement and component weight loss techniques. The results of these tests indicate that bypass lube oil</page><page sequence="106">710814-710821 filtration combined with good full-flow lube oil filtration result in lowest engine wear rate and lowest total cost for the engine user. 710814. Diesel Fuel Filter Testing. P. J. Bartlett, CAV Ltd. The published test methods for diesel fuel filters are reviewed in the light of the conditions in service. The measurement of diesel fuel filter performance in service is a long and costly process. The fact that most filters in service are choked by soft organic trace constituents of the fuel causes the greatest difficulty in laboratory testing. A test method which reproduces the organic choking effect has been described and is satis- factory for comparative tests; it has not been adopted as a standard owing mainly to difficulties associated with variability of the choking life measurement. A possible solution to this problem is suggested. 710815. Piston Rings for Diesel Engines - Effect of Keystone Angle on Oil Consumption. Bruce Hayes, Perfect Circle Div., Dana Corp. The effects on oil consumption of keystone piston rings dimensioned for OD contact with the piston groove have been compared to the effects of keystone rings dimen- sioned for ID contact with the groove in a statistically designed experiment utilizing a diesel engine at two different power output levels. 710816. The Hydraulics of Oil Scraping. S. J. Pachernegg, AVL - Institute Prof. List. This paper is a preliminary evaluation of theoretical models and a report of an initial series of experiments investigating the scraping effect and film-reducing capa- bilities of edges and sliders with cross sections similar to those of piston rings. Three basic types of scrapers or sliders are described: The hydrodynamic wedge between inclined, straight, or curved surfaces; a parallel slider that also produces lift; and a blade without a nominal bearing width. The theoretical treatment of an oil ring with two geometrically equal rails indicates that it will only scrape with its leading rail, while the trailing rail will ride a velocity wave without a scraping effect. The validity of this theory and its amplification has been experimentally supported. 1971 SA E Transactions 710817. Complete Automation of a Single Cylinder Diesel Test Engine. F. R. Russell, J. A. Wilson and O. G. Lewis, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co. A single-cylinder Caterpillar diesel test engine was automated to run under close control without attention. Four types of data were logged on a single, 6-color, 12-point strip chart recorder using only 2 ft/day of specially ruled chart paper. The 16 data points recorded included 8 linear items (0-100 scale) such as pressures, fuel flow rate, speed, torque, and oil level; 5 iron-constantan (0-300 F) temperatures, and a chromel-alumel exhaust temperature (875-1300 F); also included were two 4-figure digital values for blowby rate and for fuel rate via an automated balance, each recorded in a unique fashion without a printer. Any conditions outside set limits actuated an alarm. Special equipment protected the engine against sudden, test-ruining (hot) shutdown if power, air, or fuel supply failed, or if control of critical variables failed. 710818. Data Acquisition and Testing Study. K. L. Walker and E. A. Warman, Perkins Engines Co., England. This paper describes the initial stages of a study of the use of automatic controls in the development testing of diesel engines. In the possible levels of automation, the full range involved runs from something below the present level to a fully computerized system operating engines through all the required test programs, and producing documented reports on the results as output. The optimum level of automation with regard to technical and operational requirements is analyzed, and the preliminary results from a pilot computer-controlled test-bed are presented. 710819. Data Acquisition System for Diesel Engine Testing. Howard T. Williams, Paul D. Harper and Harvey A. Kasinoff, Koppers Co. An analytical approach has been taken to the devel- opment of a data acquisition system for diesel engine testing. This approach led to a well-defined and com- prehensive system design. Broad concepts were refined in a nonrestrictive manner to specific goals and tasks, enabling the system proposal to accurately represent the engine testing requirements. 710820. A Process Control System for Production Diesel Engine Testing. Jack C. Ritter and Kenneth J. Mundy, Mack Trucks, Inc. Current technology, especially in our dynamic industry, demands more reliable and up-to-date information in order to operate efficiently. Data of many kinds, from many sources, must be collected, analyzed, and rapidly transmitted into information which can be used to optimize performance and improve our product. To meet these needs in production diesel engine testing, a process control system has been developed around the basic objective of establishing an accurate and regimented test program, which will provide more reliable information for analysis and action, increase test capacity, provide accurate history data, and a higher quality product. This paper describes the basic design of such a system, the advantages to be gained, and the overall operation. 710821. A Correction Factor Investigation of Turbo- charged Diesel Engines. Walter Bryzik, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. 171</page><page sequence="107">710822-710825 172 The increased use of turbocharged diesel engines for automotive applications has accentuated the need for accurate power correction functions. The study's purpose was to evaluate the effect of dry ambient intake air temperature pressure, ambient intake air temperature, engine speed, and humidity upon the performance of a turbocharged diesel engine. Each effect is examined individually and weighted in a final relationship for standardized horsepower. Power correction formulas, in a form readily comparable to typical correction functions, are derived from the results. Testing was conducted through the use of various special test procedures, calibrations, and test equipment. With computer aid, test evaluation was conducted by utilizing various analytical and graphical methods. An accuracy comparison between actual and calculated values of power correction is presented. 710822. Turbocharged Diesel Engine Performance at Altitude. Jack W. Dennis, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The effect of altitude on the performance of two turbocharged prechamber diesel engines and one direct- injection diesel engine has been studied in a test cell. One prechamber engine was tested at altitudes up to 16,000 ft. The data from these tests are presented and compared with performance at standard conditions. Using the data, an analytical method of predicting the performance of turbocharged diesel engines at altitude has been developed. An iterative computer program, using part-load data taken at standard conditions is used for the prediction. Comparison is made with the simulated altitude date and with other calculation methods.

Site Rating Methods for Naturally Aspirated Diesel Engines. R. P. Sharma, Magniram Bangur Memorial Engrg. College; P. D. Paranjpe and B. L. Maheshwari, Birla Institute of Technology and Science. A laboratory setup for testing diesel engines at simulated altitudes (pressure and temperature according to inter- national standard atmosphere data) up to 14,000 ft is described. Results obtained are discussed in relation to site rating of engine. Attention is drawn to different bases which may be used in correcting engine performance (for example, constant fuel delivery, smoke density, indicated specific fuel consumption, and constant thermal loading method). The validity of derating formulas when applied to a small open-chamber, 4-stroke, water-cooled diesel engine, running at constant speed, is discussed. The effect of increased speed under constant air-fuel ratio conditions is also examined. 1971 SA E Transactions 710824. Combustion and Emission Formation in the Stirling Engine with Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Stephen R. Davis, Naeim A. Henein and Rich- ard R. Lundstrom, Wayne State University. The combustion and emission formation in continuous combustion burners have been studied both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical study is concerned with the combus- tion and emission formation in idealized sprays in quiescent air. The effects of the spray rotation and the air axial and radial velocities have been examined. A model has been developed for the emission formation in an actual Stirling engine. This model showed that the incomplete combustion products are primarily formed in the heterogeneous eddies zone near the burner walls. In this region, surface combustion takes place. The nitric oxide is primarily formed in the premixed-eddies zone where microvolume combustion is believed to take place. The experimental results deal with the effect of diluting the charge by using excess air or exhaust-gas recirculation on performance and emissions. The emis- sions measured are the nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and carbon. The tests were conducted at 5 and 8 hp. The effect of residence time in air preheater on the different emissions has been assessed. It was shown that the increase in residence time was effective at light loads and low air-fuel ratios in reducing exhaust emissions. Exhaust-gas recirculation was effective in reducing the nitric oxide emissions up to approximately 40% recir- culation. However, the thermal efficiency of the Stirling engine decreases with the increase in the percentage exhaust-gas recirculation. 710825. Exhaust Emission Characteristics of Hybrid Heat Engine/Electric Vehicles. M. G. Hinton, Jr., T. Iura, W. U. Roessler and H. T. Sampson, The Aerospace Corp. As part of a study to ascertain the feasibility of hybrid heat engine/electric automotive vehicles, exhaust emis- sions were calculated to determine both the state- of-the-art and the potential emission capability of vehicles incorporating the battery /heat engine powerplant. Vehicle emissions were determined for four vehicle classes: full-size family car, small commuter car, delivery /postal van, and the city bus. Specific mass emission data (in terms of gm/bhp-hr) were gathered for the spark ignition, diesel, gas turbine, Rankine cycle, and the Stirling cycle engines. Data inputs required the determination of steady-state mass emission data at rated-load as well as part-load operating conditions. These data were utilized to calculate the exhaust emission characteristics of the passenger car and commuter car driving over the Federal LA-4 driving cycle. Emission data for the delivery van and city bus were calculated over an arbitrarily selected driving cycle. The results indicate that marked reductions in emissions can be obtained with the spark ignition engine operating at lean air-fuel ratios, which is permitted</page><page sequence="108">710826-710831 by the steady-state operation characteristic of the hybrid. For the future, the gas turbine shows promise of further emission reductions, and the diesel engine shows promise in certain areas. 710826. Fuel Cell Powerplant for Deep-Submergence Vehicles. R. A. Sanderson and M. B. Landau, United Aircraft Corp.; and D. M. Spadone, Naval Ship Systems Command. A 20-kW fuel-cell powerplant is being developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, under contract to the Naval Ship Systems Command, to power undersea vehicles for deep submergence. The powerplant consists of alkaline fuel cells and auxiliary components for heat and product water management located in a containment vessel. A multi- plex-control system minimizes electrical penetration of containment vessels. This powerplant, designated Power- cel 15 A, when supplied with gaseous hydrogen and oxygen stored at high pressure, will deliver 93 Whr/lb for its designed 36 hr 250kWhr mission which is three times the energy density of the best batteries in service today. 710827. Recycle Diesel Underwater Powerplants. J. R. Puttick, Ricardo &amp; Co. Ltd. An underwater powerplant is described based on a conventional diesel engine using normal hydrocarbon fuel but aspirating a mixture of stored oxygen diluted with recycled exhaust gas, the remaining exhaust gas being passed to the sea by a compressor. The theoretical aspects of the system are covered, followed by details of the mechanical and control system developments carried out in the construction of an operational prototype under- water powerplant. Comparisons are drawn between the recycle unit using various forms of oxygen storage and lead acid batteries, other alternative power systems also being discussed. 1971 SA E Transactions 710828. Undersea Application of a Closed Brayton Cycle Powerplant. E. A. Mock, AiResearch Manufac- turing Co.; and H. Balukjian, Naval Ship Engineering Center. The design criteria for an undersea powerplant appli- cation are reviewed. A closed Brayton cycle power system utilizing the catalytic combustion of hydrogen and oxygen as a heat source is described. System operation is at a design depth of 20,000 ft for a 50 kW rated output. The total system weight and volume is shown for various endurance missions, as well as a weight and volume breakdown for the closed Brayton cycle plant, reactants, pressure vessels and buoyancy material. An alternative closed Brayton powerplant design, utilizing a high frequency output alternator, is compared with the ref- erence 400 Hz design. By utilizing a higher shaft speed, the closed Brayton loop pressure level can be increased, which will reduce the size and weight of the closed loop heat exchanger components. The rotating unit size is also significantly reduced. 710829. A New Look at Swash-Plate Drive Mechanisms. E. R. Maki and A. O. DeHart, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The versatile, compact, and simple swash-plate drive mechanism has been adopted for a variety of applications to give a reliable method of converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion. Historically, designers have concerned themselves only with the kinematics of swash- plate drives. This paper describes an analysis which combines swash-plate drive kinematics with hydrody- namic-bearing theory so a performance evaluation of the complete mechanism can be made. The predicted oper- ating characteristics have been verified by tests on full-size models. Operating experience has shown the properly designed swash-plate drive system is a competitive method for converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion. A comprehensive bibliography of swash-plate drive litera- ture is included. 1971 SAE Transactions 710830. The Variable Displacement Engine: An Advanced Concept Powerplant. Harvey W. Welsh and Charles T. Riley, Thermo Mechanical Systems Co. This paper describes a new concept of reciprocating engine which permits the control of displacement and the clearance volume as a function of power in order to better match the engine to vehicle power requirements. It is applicable to both diesel and otto-cycle engines and shows promise for increased efficiency, especially for the otto-cycle engine. This engine also has the potential of improving engine emissions characteristics. 710831. Effects of Compression Ratio Changes on Ex- haust Emissions. A. E. Felt and S. R. Krause, Ethyl Corp. The results of a comprehensive test program using a 1969 383-CID V-8 engine at two compression ratios - 9.5:1 and 7.6:1 - are reported. Compression ratio changes were effected by piston changes only. Except for necessary ignition timing modifications, no other changes were made in the engine. The effects of compression ratio changes on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption were studied in steady-state dynamometer tests and in vehicle tests. At MBT ignition timing or at the same percentage power loss from MBT timing at each compression ratio and with identical carburetion, decreasing the compres- sion ratio from 9.5:1 to 7.6:1 produced the following results: 1. In steady-state dynamometer tests, NO (ppm) and CO (%) emissions were unchanged, hydrocarbons (ppm) were decreased, and fuel consumption was increased when equal power was developed at both compression ratios. 2. In vehicle tests using the 7-mode Federal Test Procedure, NO and CO emissions were unchanged and hydrocarbons increased somewhat. Additional vehicle tests showed 6% higher road-load fuel consumption and 173</page><page sequence="109">710832-710837 174 6% longer full-throttle acceleration times for the lower compression ratio. Thus, tests in this engine show that decreasing compression ratio cannot be justified on the basis of reducing NO emissions. 1971 SAE Transactions 710832. Effect of Compression Ratio, Mixture Strength, Spark Timing, and Coolant Temperature Upon Exhaust Emissions and Power. R. C. Lee, Phillips Petroleum Co. A single-cylinder engine operating at constant speed using gasoline as fuel was used to study the effects of compression ratio, mixture1 strength, spark timing, and coolant temperature upon exhaust emissions and power for a part-throttle condition. Of these variables, mixture strength and spark timing had the largest effect upon exhaust emissions, followed by coolant temperature with compression ratio having minor effects. Spark timing followed by compression ratio had the largest effect upon power and fuel consumption. 710833. Emission Characteristics of Natural Gas as an Automotive Fuel. R. D. Fleming and J. R. Allsup, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. A study of natural gas as a low-pollution automotive fuel was conducted using a single-cylinder engine, a multi- cylinder engine, and six vehicles. Results showed that the light-load, lean-limit misfire region of natural gas begins at an air-fuel ratio between 140-150% of stoichiometric. Changes in ignition timing significantly influenced emis- sions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons but had little effect on carbon monoxide emission. Lower emissions can be achieved (by adjustment) with current design engines, but with heavy penalty to engine performance. Emissions from vehicles fueled with natural gas are virtually unaffected by temperature change within the range 20-100 F. Natural gas exhaust is estimated to be 22-25% as reactive as gasoline exhaust. 710834. Survey of Nationwide Automotive Exhaust Emis- sions and PCV System Conditions - Summer 1970. F. L. Voelz, E. W. Onyon, R. M. Oust, W. C. Rusnack, J. S. Segal and B. G. Gower, Atlantic Richfield Co. Results of a nationwide vehicle exhaust emission survey and PCV system check are presented. More than 75,000 vehicles were tested in 15 metropolitan areas. Hydro- carbon and carbon monoxide emissions are summarized at idle and 2500 rpm (free running), and the condition of the PCV system is correlated with vehicle age. Vehicle distribution curves for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are shown for selected year groupings of American and foreign-built vehicles. The effect of carburetor adjustment (air-fuel ratio, rpm) on idle emissions is demonstrated for those 32% of the total vehicles for which adjustments were made. 710835. Effect of Engine Intake-Air Humidity, Temper- ature, and Pressure on Exhaust Emissions. S. R. Krause, Ethyl Corp. Variations in atmospheric humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure substantially affect almost all engine mass and volume exhaust emissions. Emission meas- urements were conducted on seven engines in accordance with the Gasoline Fueled Heavy-Duty Engine procedures in the 1970 Federal Register. Equations with satisfactory correlation were derived to adjust NO mass and volume emissions taken at test conditions to a standard condition of 75 grains of moisture. Less satisfactory equations were derived to similarly correct hydrocarbon emissions for moisture effects and to correct CO emissions to standard conditions of 90 F and 29.92 in Hg. Unfortunately, no other equations could be derived to describe the behavior of all seven engines because engine-to-engine variation was too great. Emissions from different engines are affected differently at various atmospheric conditions. Therefore, accurate emission testing on some engines can only be accomplished by controlling inlet air temperature and by testing on days of similar barometric pressure. Discussion: Richard Nunez, Chrysler Corp. 1971 SAE Transactions 710836. Diesel Emissions as Related to Engine Variables and Fuel Characteristics. W. F. Marshall and R. D. Fleming, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. The influences of fuel characteristics and engine param- eters on exhaust emissions were studied experimentally using four diesel engines. All engines utilized direct- injection combustion systems and included a 2-cycle, air-scavenged unit and three 4-cycle engines. Two of the 4-cycle engines were naturally aspirated, and one was turbocharged. Seven fuels were selected to cover the broad com- positional ranges of diesel fuels marketed throughout the country. Aside from the effect of fuel density on carbon monoxide (CO) emission, no fuel property showed an influence on emissions that was consistent for all engines tested. The study of engine variables included modifications to the fuel-injection system, variations in intake air temperature and density, exhaust recirculation, and water injection. As diesel engines generally emit large quantities of nitrogen oxides (NOJ and little CO or unburned hydrocarbon (HC), this study was aimed primarily at reducing NOx emissions while maintaining engine per- formance and an otherwise favorable emission pattern. Levels of emissions other than NOx are near minimum when the engine is adjusted for peak performance. Exhaust gas recirculation and addition of water to the intake air were found quite effective in limiting emissions of NOx with little sacrifice in engine performance or increase in CO and HC levels. 710837. Design and Development of Fluids for Traction and Friction Type Transmissions. M. W. Hasel-</page><page sequence="110">710838-710842 tine and I. N. Duling, Sun Oil Co., D. S. Gates, Delaware County Community College; P. E. Hagstrom and R. J. Stenger, Sun Oil Co. The traction coefficients for a series of hydrocarbon fluids were determined and related to their structural and rheological properties. A continuous relationship was found between the coefficient of traction of the poly(l- olefin) fluids and the number of carbon atoms in the monomer with a maximum at poly(l-butene). A family of gem-dimethyl substituted structures was found to exhibit unusually high-traction coefficients for viscosity index levels. The manner in which certain types of additives affect traction was determined in the development of a formu- lated traction fluid. Various standard tests show that the formulated traction fluid has very good oxidation stabil- ity, provides excellent wear and rust and corrosion protection and offers comparable bearing fatigue life to a conventional automatic transmission fluid. The effect on seals is also similar to that of an ATF. Field tests indicate that the formulated traction fluid will operate effectively in traction transmissions, and conventional automatic transmissions; and will lengthen service life of limited slip differentials and roller clutches. 710838. Automatic Transmission Fluid Viscosity Require- ments. M. L. Haviland and E. D. Davison, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Performance-based test techniques were developed to determine high- and low-temperature automatic trans- mission fluid viscosity requirements. High-temperature fluid viscosity requirements were determined using en- gine-transmission-dynamometer tests. Low-temperature fluid viscosity requirements were established with a motor-driven three-speed transmission apparatus. It is concluded that the current used-fluid DEXRON viscosity limit of 5.5 cs minimum at 210 F provides a good safety factor for preventing excessive internal leakage at high temperatures. Since some DEXRON fluids have -40 F viscosities approaching the 55,000 cp specification limit, lowering it will be considered in future specifications. 1971 SA E Transactions 710839. Short-Trip Engine Oil Rust Testing. James P. Bernard, Fuel Sciences Dept., Ford Motor Co. Twenty vehicles were tested on a short- trip winter driving schedule in order to study the effects of some engine, oil, and fuel variables on engine rusting. The results show that: rusting in the V8 engines was worse than in the 6-cyl engines; the effect of exhaust gas recirculation is small but it does increase rusting; unleaded fuel reduces engine rusting; ashless oil formulations may not be satisfactory even with unleaded fuels; present laboratory engine tests may not be adequate to predict oil performance for six months of severe winter service. 710840. The Relative Effectiveness of V.l. Improvers on an In-Service Viscosity Basis. I. R. H. Crail and P. J. Hattersley, Edwin Cooper &amp; Co. Ltd. It has been shown that the concentration of V.l. improver polymer required to give a predicted residual viscosity lift in a given base oil, after a shear stability test related to over-the-road performance, is relative independent of the Shear Stability Index of the polymer over a wide range of shear stability level. Evidence is included which indicates that the high-temperature diesel engine performance of polymethacrylate V.l. improvers is related to the concen- tration of polymer in the lubricant and independent of the dispersancy capabilities of the polymer. These findings have demonstrated that the use of a predicted in-service viscosity instead of a point-of-sale viscosity as a specification target has a significant effect on the selection of the V.l. improver for use in a lubricant. In particular, it becomes practicable to use more shear stable V.l. improvers than were formerly used. 710841. An Engine's Definition of Unleaded Gasoline. Ralph P. Doelling, Cities Service Oil Co. With unleaded and low-lead gasolines being introduced into the marketplace in increased numbers, definition of what is meant by the terms unleaded and low-lead is becoming important. What quantity of lead can a gasoline contain before effects normally associated with the use of gasolines leaded to current levels are encountered? An engine program designed to investigate the effect of varying gasoline lead levels upon changes in hydro- carbon exhaust emissions levels resulting from combus- tion chamber deposits and valve recession was extended to very low lead levels. The results of this program define the amount of lead a fuel may contain before lead deposit effects on emission are observed and valve recession problems are eliminated as falling between 0.004-0.007 gm/ gal. The usefulness of these parameters to define unleaded gasoline is discussed together with other parameters that must also be investigated before a complete definition of unleaded gasoline can be established. 710842. Role of Lead Antiknocks in Modern Gasolines. Alden J. Pahnke and Wilfred E. Bettoney, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). The role of lead antiknocks in modern gasolines is discussed in terms of engine-fuel relationships. Exhaust emission characteristics of leaded and unleaded gasolines are compared in terms of both gaseous and particulate constituents. The effect of removing lead from gasoline on engine cleanliness, exhaust valve seat recession, octane requirements, and octane requirement increase is assessed. Extensive use is made of published information and some new information is presented. It is apparent that the use of lead antiknocks in gasoline produces effects on engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics which are both positive and negative in nature. Much more information is needed, particularly in terms of future vehicles equipped with advanced control systems, to determine the optimum fuel composition. In view of this situation, the best course of 175</page><page sequence="111">710843-710847 176 action appears to be one which provides for maximum flexibility, both in systems to meet future emissions and in use of lead antiknocks. 1971 SA E Transactions 710843-. The Effect of Leaded and Unleaded Gasolines on Exhaust Emissions as Influenced by Combustion Chamber Deposits. Henry E. Leikkanen, Texaco, Inc.; and E. W. Beckman, Chrysler Corp. The use of lead compounds, when added to gasolines to enhance their antiknock properties, has resulted in more efficient combustion in high-compression engines, but their use has also caused lead deposits in the combustion chamber. To assess how lead antiknock compounds in gasolines influence combustion chamber deposits and exhaust emission levels, an intensive state-of-the-art review has been made, and data submitted by 18 different companies have been analyzed. These studies ranged in scope from single-cylinder engine investigations to a 122-car consumer test program. Based on this review, it was concluded that cars operated on leaded gasolines have higher equilibrium hydrocarbon emission than those operated on unleaded gasolines, and that mileage accu- mulation conditions exert a major influence on the magnitude of the hydrocarbon net lead effect. The presence of lead in gasoline has no effect on carbon monoxide emission levels. 1971 SA E Transactions 710844. The Effects of TEL on Oxidation in an Exhaust Manifold Reactor - A Single-Cylinder Engine Study. Richard C. Schwing, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. In rich-exhaust manifold reactors, complete oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC), generally characterized by luminous conditions and high temper- atures, is desirable. Some of the conditions necessary for luminous oxidation in an insulated exhaust reactor have been explored with a single-cylinder engine using both leaded and unleaded isooctane. Threshold-reactor air- injection rates required for luminous oxidation in the reactor were determined for engine air-fuel ratios (A/F) between 11.2 and 14.1. Leaded isooctane produced higher unburned HC concentrations in the exhaust than unleaded isooctane when injection air was introduced as well as when no air was added. In addition, oxidation of CO in the reactor was hindered in the tests with leaded isooctane. During one set of experiments, conditions were such that luminous oxidation in the reactor was achieved with the unleaded fuel, but was not achieved with the leaded fuel. In warmup studies, a longer time was required to reach luminous conditions in the reactor when leaded isooctane was used in the engine than when unleaded isooctane was used. Discussion: E. N. Cantwell, Jr., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.; Author's closure 1971 SA E Transactions 710845. The Automotive Engine - Today and Tomorrow. Max M. Roensch, General Motors Technical Center, General Motors Corp. Automotive engine output and efficiency have greatly improved over the years due to the combined efforts of the automotive and petroleum industries. As compression ratios and octane ratings of fuels have increased, the automotive engineer has been able to give the customer more for his money in either economy or performance, or a combination of both. A brief history of these developments should serve to point to the problems of the future, since octane requirements of the 1971 models have been generally reduced to enable the automobile manufacturer to meet the stringent exhaust emission standards. Since lead antiknocks are the most economical and widely used method of increasing the octane rating of gasoline, their effects on engine parameters such as durability, ORI, and emissions will be compared with lead-free gasolines. The economic impact of the change from the 94 and 100 octane number fuels to a 91 octane lead-free gasoline will be presented. Consideration will be given to the question of how much control from automobiles is really needed to achieve a satisfactory level of ambient air quality. The future of the piston engine, as well as possible substitutes, is discussed in view of the stringent emission controls proposed for 1975 and 1976. A critical review of both the ambient air quality and emission standards indicates the need for revisions and a careful evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio, so that the passenger car buyer will not be needlessly penalized with both high initial costs and high operating costs. The potential waste of our national resources must also receive consideration. 1971 SA E Transactions 710847. (P-39) The Effect on Data Reproducibility of Dummy Modification. J. F. Sprouffske, W. H. Muzzy, Edwin M. Trout, Thomas D. Clarke and C. D. Gragg, 6570th Aerospace Medical Res. Lab., Holloman AFB. The objectives of this study were twofold: to determine if the variability of dummy performance could be reduced by refinishing the joints and bearing surfaces of the dummy; and to establish a technique for preparing dummies for dynamic tests and measurements to be made for evaluating dummy performance. The testing was divided into three groups. The first phase evaluated the effect on data reproducibility by adjusting the dummy only before a complete series; the next phase evaluated the effect of adjusting before each run; the third phase evaluated the effect of changing the sled deceleration level. In each phase the lap belt, seat pan down, and seat pan forward loads were obtained. The data consist of graphs delineating the alteration on these loads during consecutive runs in each of the above phases. In addition the loads were plotted versus the sled deceleration level</page><page sequence="112">710848-710851 and regression lines calculated. The results indicate that the standard errors about the regression lines of force versus deceleration were significantly decreased compared to previous studies. The seat pan forward force remained relatively constant if the dummy's joints were adjusted between each test. The dummy should have the joints adjusted every time or at least a minimum of every five tests. 710848. (P-39) Joint Range of Motion and Mobility of the Human Torso. Richard G. Snyder, Don B. Chaffin and Rodney K. Schutz, The University of Michigan. The object of this study has been to develop a quantitative description of the mobility of the human torso, including the shoulder girdle, neck, thoracic and lumbar vertebral column, and pelvis. This has been accomplished by a systematic multidisciplinary investigation involving tech- niques of cadaver dissection and measurement, utilizing cineradiofluoroscopy for joint center of rotation location, anthropometry, radiography and photogrammetry for selected positions and motions of living subjects, and computer analysis. Positional and dimensional data were obtained for 72 anthropometric dimensions on 28 living male subjects statistically representative of the 1967 USAF anthropometric survey of 3542 rated officers, including bone lengths of the extremities measured in the living, utilizing the landmarks established in initial cadaver dissection. Centers of joint rotation (link and positions) for the torso and limbs, lengths of functional torso links, and link excursions were correlated with linear body dimensions and landmarks obtained in traditional anthropometry. Some 35 positions for each subject were analyzed utilizing an off-line data coder system to determine how arm position affects the three-space surface coordinates. Three simultaneous regression equa- tions were used to develop predictive models for torso positions referenced to a sitting or standing position or task. The major results of the study are prediction equations and graphs describing how the base of the spine reference point (fifth lumbar spinal surface marker) moves in relation to defined seated and standing reference points for given reaches, and the development of techniques by which the lengths and excursions of torso and limb links may be estimated and located. It was found that the surface landmarks selected could predict precise location of the underlying anatomical landmarks. The results of this study provide initial basic data regarding human torso motion, joint center of motion, and link relationships. 710849. (P-39) A Comparison Between Human Kinemat- ics and the Predictions of Mathematical Crash Victim Simulators. D. H. Robbins, R. G. Snyder, J. H. McElhaney and V. L. Roberts, The University of Michigan. A study has been conducted as an initial step in determining the differences observed between the motions of a living human impact sled test subject and a dummy test subject. The mechanism which is proposed for accomplishing this is the HSRI Two-Dimensional Math- ematical Crash Victim Simulator. A series of measure- ments were taken on human test subjects including classical and nonclassical anthropometric measurements, range of motion measurements for the joints, and maximum foot force measurements. A series of mathe- matical expressions has been used to predict body segment weight, centers of gravity, and moments of inertia using the results of the various body measurements. It was then possible to prepare a data set for use with the mathematical model. In addition to the body measure- ments described above, it was necessary to determine the deceleration profile for the Daisy sled and to determine the geometry as well as the force-deformation charac- teristics for the seat and restraint environment. This being accomplished, a computer simulation of an impact sled test involving a human volunteer was made. The results are presented to conclude the paper. 710850. (P-39) Effects of Lap Belt and Three-Point Restraints on Pregnant Baboons Subjected to Deceleration. Albert I. King and Rolf H. E- ppinger, Wayne State University; Warren M. Crosby and Clarke Stout, University of Okla- homa. A series of 24 pregnant baboons was impacted under similar conditions. The only major variable was the difference in maternal restraint. The fetal death rate of 8.3% (1/12) among maternal animals impacted with three-point restraint was significantly different from five fetal deaths among 10 maternal animals impacted under lap belt restraint alone (p &lt; 0.05). It is concluded that shoulder harness restraint should be recommended for use by pregnant travelers as being significantly more protec- tive of fetal welfare when compared with lap belt restraint alone. 1971 SA E Transactions 710851. (P-39) Impact Tolerance and Response of the Human Thorax. Charles K. Kroell and Dennis C. Schneider, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and Alan M. Nahum, University of California, San Diego. At the 1970 SAE International Automobile Safety Con- ference, the first experimental chest impact results from a new, continuing biomechanics research program were presented and compared with earlier studies performed elsewhere by one of the authors using a different technique. In this paper, additional work from the current program is documented. The general objective remains unchanged: To provide improved quantification of injury tolerance and thoracic mechanical response (force-time, deflection-time, and force-deflection relationships) for blunt sternal impact to the human cadaver. Fourteen additional unembalmed specimens of both sexes (ranging in age from 19-81 years, in weight from 177</page><page sequence="113">710852-710855 178 1 17-180 lb, and in stature from 5 ft. 1-1/2 in. to 6 ft.) have been exposed to midsternal, blunt impacts using a horizontal, elastic-cord-propelled striker mass. Impact velocities were higher than those of the previous work, ranging from 14-32 mph. Striker weight varied from 3.6-52 lb, the smaller masses associated with the higher velocities. In all cases the impact was centered over the fourth interspace and delivered through a 6-in diameter, un- padded, flat wooden form with 1/2-in edge radius. In twelve cases the thoracic aorta was liquid pressurized at impact; and in seven cases, intra-aortic and intra- ventricular pressure-time histories were recorded during the impact event. Thoraic autopsies with cardiovascular disections were performed in all cases; in addition, thorough abdominal explorations were performed in nine. 710852. (P-39) Thoracic Tolerance to Whole-Body De- celeration. Harold J. Mertz and Charles W. Gadd, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A professional high diver, instrumented with acceler- ometers, performed sixteen dives from heights between 27-57 ft. For each dive he executed a 3/4 turn and landed supine on a 3-ft deep mattress which consisted of pieces of low density urethane foam encased in a nylon cover. Using FM telemetry, sagittal plane decelerations were recorded for a point either on the sternum or the forehead. Impact velocities and corresponding stopping distances for the thorax and the head were calculated from high-speed movies of the dives. For a 57-ft dive, the impact velocity of the thorax was 41 mph with a corresponding stopping distance of 34.6 in. The peak resultant deceleration of the thorax was 49.2 g with a pulse duration of 100 ms. The maximum rate of change of the deceleration of the thorax was 5900 g/s. No discomfort was experienced as a result of this impact. The maximum forehead deceleration occurred during a 47.3-ft drop and exceeded 56 g with a Gadd Severity Index greater than 465. This peak acceleration was the result of a localized impact to the skull produced by a hard spot in the helmet worn by Ross Collins and resulted in a brief, sharp head pain. The results obtained from these experiments are compared with whole-body tolerance data obtained by other investigators and a long duration acceleration tolerance level of 60 g with a pulse duration of 100 ms is recommended for the thorax in the A-P and P-A directions. 710853. (P-39) Déployable Head Restraints - A Feasi- bility Study. J. W. Melvin, J. H. McElhaney and V. L. Roberts, The University of Michigan; and H. D. Portnoy, Oakland Neurological Clinic. Present head restraint systems quite often restrict rear- ward visibility, and when not properly adjusted, their effectiveness suffers. The déployable head restraint can overcome both these problems and in addition provide head restraint performance better than fixed systems. This paper describes a project to study the feasibility of déployable head restraints. Starting with two-dimensional computer simulations of front seat occupant kinematics in read-end collisions, initial performance criteria for deployment times, and restraint configurations were determined for various impact velocities. Based on these criteria, two types of déployable systems were designed and constructed, one an inflatable system and the other a rigid sliding system. These prototype systems then underwent a test and development program using anthropomorphic dummies and an impact sled. The test program evaluated the effectiveness of the head restraint systems under high- and low-speed crash simulations. In addition, tests were performed to study the effect of restraint deployment on the malpositioned occupant. The results of the test program are discussed and comparisons are made be- tween the two prototype systems and existing head restraint designs. 1971 SA E Transactions 710854. (P-39) Comparison of Head Acceleration Injury Indices in Cadaver Skull Fracture. Voigt R. Hodgson and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State University. Skull fracture was produced in forty cadavers which were dropped with their heads striking rigid flat, hemispherical, and cylindrically shaped surfaces on the front side, and rear. The heads were instrumented with biaxial accel- erometers and force of impact was measured. Severity Index and Effective Displacement Index are compared at fracture level for all frontal impacts and the frontal flat plate results are compared to The Wayne State Cerebral Concussion Tolerance Curve. Indices calculated for Alderson 50th percentile dummy frontal head impacts onto a rigid flat plate are found to be higher than those for cadaver skull fracture impacts in the same drop height range. 1971 SA E Transactions 710855. (P-39) Strength and Response of the Human Neck. H. J. Mertz, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State University. Human volunteers were subjected to static and dynamic environments which produced noninjurious neck re- sponses for neck extension and flexion. Cadavers were used to extend this data into the injury region. Analysis of the data from volunteer and cadaver experiments indi- cates that equivalent moment at the occipital condyles is the critical injury parameter in extension and in flexion. Static voluntary levels of 17.5 ft lb in extension and 26 ft lb in flexion were attained. A maximum dynamic value of 35 ft lb in extension was reached without injury. In hyperflexion, the chin-chest reaction changes the loading condition at the occipital condyles which resulted in a maximum equivalent moment of 65 ft lb without injury. Noninjurious neck shear and axial forces of 190 lb and</page><page sequence="114">710856-710861 250 lb are recommended based on the static strength data obtained on the volunteers. Neck response envelopes for performance of mechanical necks are given for the extension and flexion modes of the neck. 1971 SAE Transactions 710856. (P-39) A Study of Responses and Tolerances of the Neck. C. W. Gadd and C. C. Culver, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and A. M. Nahum, University of California, San Diego. The principal objectives of this study were first to obtain experimental curves of angulation versus moment of resistance of the human neck in hyperextension and lateral flexion, and second to determine angular limits short of significant injury observable in the unembalmed subjects employed in the study. The first of the tests were of the "static" type with load applied over a period of approximately 1 s. To determine the applicability of the data to dynamic conditions, tests were also made of the dissected neck at angulation velocities comparable with those of typical accidental injury. Overall resisting moment and injury threshold were similar under the dynamic loading, but somewhat greater moment of resistance was noted during the (earlier) portion of the loading cycle when angular velocity was greatest. It is believed the data obtained together with muscular restraint data of other investigators who have used volunteers should be of value in the selection of neck characteristics for anthropometric test devices. Tolerances of the unembalmed laryngeal cartilages to direct frontal impact in situ were also obtained. 710857. (P-39) Human Head Linear and Angular Accel- erations During Impact. Thomas D. Clarke, C. Dee Gragg, James F. Sprouffske and Edwin M. Trout, 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Lab., Holloman AFB; Roger M. Zimmerman, New Mexico State University; and William H. Muzzy, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Lab. Head linear and angular accelerations of humans were investigated during exposure to abrupt linear deceleration (-GJ. The 14 subjects were restrained with three different restraints: lap belt only, Air Force shoulder harness, and air bag plus lap belt. Peak sled decelerations ranged from 7.7-10.3 g. The results indicated that peak head angular and linear resultant accelerations were elevated with the air bag in contrast to the Air Force shoulder harness or lap belt only restraints. However, the peak angular and linear accelerations may have less traumatic consequences than the degree of head-neck hyperextension. 710859. (P-39) A Statistical Survey and a Methodology Used to Deal with the Observations Collected from 6000 Road Casualties. Paul Bourret and Nicole Alaouie, Salon-de-Provence Hospital, France; and Marie-Claude Rambach, Michel Margaine and Olivier Coppet, Onser, Paris. The purpose of this survey is to discuss the methods used to analyze 6000 individual accidents in a definite area by the same medical team. It covers the study of the circumstances of the accident, the injuries observed, their treatment, evolution and final results with their socio- logical and economical consequences. This study attempts to establish the relationship between the signs of severity recorded on the spot and the final result. It concentrates primarily upon lesions injuries of, leading to two groups of victims. The poly-injured whose injuries compound without getting worse and the poly-traumatic victims whose lesions are of a body in motion and whose injuries are latent and get worse mutually. These 6000 observations constitute many months work. This preliminary study deals with 800 cases and attempts to point out the methodology rather than the results. 710860. (P-39) Bus Collision Causation and Injury Pat- terns. A. W. Siegel and A. M. Nahum, Univer- sity of California; and D. E. Runge, Automobile Club of Southern California. Although school buses statistically are the safest mode of mass transportation, the reported number of pupils injured appears to be increasing faster than the number transported. During the last ten years, clinical inter- disciplinary research of vehicular collisions and their attending injuries has contributed significantly to the recent reduction, both absolute and relative, in highway injuries and fatalities. The objective of the UCLA Trauma Research Group in the present study was to apply clinical interdisciplinary research methodology to the problem of school bus and coach passenger protection. Current available statistics on bus collision and injury production are reviewed and presented as background material. Pertinent findings of the study include collision causation factors resulting from drive, vehicle and environmental influences. A major portion of the paper relates injury causation and injury patterns to ejection, restraints, structure design, seats, etc. Occupant kine- matics and the subsequent injury production are related to three classes of school bus and coach collisions. Post collision factors influencing injury, such as egress, extrication, firet, etc., are discussed. Summaries of selected cases are included to illustrate methodology and findings. The paper contains conclusions and recommendations resulting from the statistical review and clinical inter- disciplinary study. 710861. (P-39) Smaller Vehicle Versus Larger Vehicle Collisions. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink and David M. Blaisdell, University of California, Los Angeles. The research techniques of instrumented full-scale col- lision experiments were applied to evaluate relative crash 179</page><page sequence="115">710862-710866 180 performances of smaller passenger vehicles colliding with larger vehicles. The larger vehicle weighed from 1.5-4 times as much as the small vehicle. The structure- overriding tendencies of larger vehicles in a particular collision was found to greatly influence the severity of exposure to injury for occupants of the smaller vehicle; relative strength of structures was similarly important. The crash safety of a motorist is shown to depend more on the use of adequate restraining devices than on the smallness of his car. Mismatched sizes of vehicles were crashed head-on, as well as in rear-end and intersection-type exposures. Analytical relationships of post-impact dis- placements as well as transducer and photographic instrumentation data are presented. Actual accident investigations were conducted which provided background preparation for this series of crash tests. Results of these investigations provide additional findings relative to the small versus larger vehicle collision injury problem. 1971 SA E Transactions 710862. (P-39) Mechanisms of Injuries to Unrestrained Front Seat Passengers and Their Prevention by Progressive Instrument Panel Design. Karl Wil- fert, Daimler-Benz AG, Germany; and Gerhard Voigt, University of Lund, Sweden. The first part of this investigation is concerned with the results of the autopsies of 70 passengers. The material has been gathered from head-on collisions involving passenger cars of various types, where no safety belts were used. The injury mechanisms are divided into six typical groups according to the parts of the vehicles struck by the passengers. It appeared that the most important factors deciding the type of injury mechanism were the construction of the engine hood, the windshield and frame, the instrument panel and the seat, not considering intruding objects and parts of other vehicles which may cause injuries. The second part of this investigation has its objective the corroboration of these observations in sled tests of head-on collisions using dummies; the results obtained are measured as forces acting in the head, the chest, and the thighs. In addition, the movement of the occupants is studied when the design of the instrument panel is changed. 710863. (P-39) Simulation of Head-On Collision With Unrestrained Front Seat Passengers and Dif- ferent Instrument Panels. Gerhard E. Voigt, University of Lund, Sweden; and Wolfgang Lange, Max Planck Institut fur Arbeitsphysi- ologie. Head-on collisions are simulated on the impact sled with different instrument panels and unembalmed, nonbelted cadavers. The accelerations above the crown of the head and at the back at the level of the middle of the chest are measured and all injuries ascertained by autopsy. The results give constructional ideas for the design of the instrument panel on the passenger side. To avoid injuries to the trunk and legs, the impact areas for the trunk and for the knees should be so placed as to enable the trunk to retain its almost upright position on impact. The impact area for the trunk should be as large as possible and not fold out upward. The avoidance of head and neck injuries presents a particularly difficult problem. 710864. (P-39) Door Crashworthiness Criteria. James H. McElhaney, Richard L. Stalnaker, Verne L. Roberts and Richard G. Snyder, The University of Michigan. A study of the biomechanical factors concerned with the design of side structures and doors for crashworthiness has been made. Questions regarding optimum stiffness, location of reinforcing members, effect of armrests, and padding have been answered within the framework of injury criteria models. Results of animal studies, cadaver studies, and anthropometric dummies have been com- bined to produce injury criteria for lateral impacts to the head, thorax, and abdomen. Impacts were applied util- izing a specially designed "air gun" in a laboratory environment emphasizing reproducibility and control. Full scale crash simulations were performed on an impact sled to verify the results of the more specialized tests and analyses. Scaled models of current production doors were used in the animal series. Scaling relationships for various species of animals have been developed and extrapolated to man. Significant differences in right and left side tolerances to impact were noted and detailed. Additional verification of the Maximum Strain Criteria Model (MSC) is reported. Critical impact velocities for various body sites have been developed for several categories of impact and are presented in ways thought to be most meaningful to designers. 1971 SA E Transactions 710866. (P-39) Preliminary Vehicle Tests - Inflatable Occupant Restraint Systems. James F. Martin and David J. Romeo, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. A test program was conducted in which 12 full-scale automobiles were crashed under controlled conditions to provide detailed performance data on inflatable occupant restraint systems (IORS). Head, chest and pelvis, three component acceleration data are presented. Femur and tibia forces and vehicle acceleration and crush data are also shown. Several different methods of analyzing the IORS are discussed. From these analyses, it is possible to identify reasons for marked deviations from normal IORS per- formance as well as to rate tentatively the more normally performing systems. The conclusions reached are founded on quantitative data analysis and are of considerable scope for the small data sample available from this program.</page><page sequence="116">710867-710870 710867. (P-39) Nonlacerating Glass Windshields - A New Improved Approach. E. R. Plumât, R. Van Laethem and P. Baudin, Glaverbel S. A. This study is part of a research program which aims to develop a laminated glass windshield whose laceration potential is very weak and even almost nonexistent. Two types of new safety windshields are tested. They differ only by the strengthening level of the V.H.R. glass which is used. In both cases, the very thin 0.050 in. (1.2 mm) thick inner sheet and the 0.110 in. (2.8 mm) thick outer sheet are made of V.H.R. glass. Nevertheless, the glass of the outer ply has a deliberately limited tensile strength. The polyvinylbutyral plastic interlayer is 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) thick. The evaluation of the biomechanical behaviour of these windshields is made in different ways, among them a laboratory study which includes impact tests with a headform free falling on positioned samples. During the impact, all measures defining the safety performance are recorded at high speed: the deceleration peak along two orthogonal axes, the resultant severity index relating to the initial impact and to the plow-in, the tearing length of the plastic interlayer, and finally the laceration potential is evaluated on a laceration rating scale used by Prof. Patrick at the Wayne State University. A laceration index is given following the number and size of the cuts measured on the two superposed chamois leathers cov- ering the headform. The experimental parameters particularly studied are: temperature, impact velocity, impact location, increase of the mechanical strength of the sheets. The new safety reinforced laminated windshield, whose laceration potential is very low and nonexistent at very high impact energy, might be used as a true passive restraint system if the tensile strengths of the reinforced glass are adjusted. 1971 SAE Transactions 710868. (P-39) Influence of Ambient Temperature on Impact Performance of HPR Windshields. R. L. Morrison, Glass Div., Ford Motor Co. This paper describes one approach in defining the temperature sensitivity of the HPR windshield in real life accidents. It examines the field impact performance of the HPR windshield as related to the ambient temperature at the time of accident. Using vehicle accident data from the ACIR program, two types of windshield impact patterns, together with their resulting frequency and severity of injury, are compared. Findings indicate that occupant injury levels are likely to be higher when the windshield interlayer is ruptured on impact as contrasted with no rupture. The level of injury is generally reduced at ambient temperatures above 70 F, as compared with the lower temperatures. 710869. (P-39) Low Velocity Impacts and Temperature Sensitivity of Automotive Windshields. R. G. Rieser, J. Chabal and C. W. Lewis, PPG Industries, Inc. Headform impacts at 5.5-7.7 mph using the 22 lb air-stabilized missile were run on glass panels that did not fracture to measure deceleration pulses and obtain Severity Index (SI) values. These tests show low SI values for this range of impact velocities. Dummy-windshield tests were run at speeds of 8.7-21.9 mph to measure SI and laceration. In all cases laceration is low and SI values do not indicate concussive hazard below approximately 15 mph impact velocity even when the glass does not fracture. These data are of particular interest for those accident situations below the probable velocity for deployment of a passive restraint such as the air bag. The currently used HPR interlayer for automotive windshields shows excellent safety performance at room temperature but is less effective at other temperatures. Impact studies of several glass structures at 30-110 F are presented for 0.03 and 0.037 in thickness HPR interlayers. A simulated dashboard is included in the dummy- windshield impact tests. Extensive HPR interlayer rupture occurs at 30 and 110 F, producing greater laceration hazard. These data indicate that an improvement in temperature performance is desirable providing other safety performance characteristics are retained. 710870. (P-39) Internal Head Injury Assessment. William R. S. Fan, Ford Motor Co. The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) Number 208 establishes quantitative criteria for auto- mobile occupant injury, as determined by use of an- thropomorphic test devices. For the head, the criterion is a severity index of 1000, calculated according to a weight- ed-impulse method commonly known as the Gadd Severity Index (GSI). The biomechanical problem of establishing a com- prehensive tolerance criterion for head injury has long been of interest. Since this is a relatively unknown area, many assessment methods have been conceived. These methods can be classified into three categories: the severity index, the brain-skull model, and the brain model. Most of the assessments were based upon the Wayne State Tolerance curve. In a recent paper, a comparison of two well known methods for estimating internal head injury hazard was presented. The first method, proposed by C. W. Gadd, is a weighted impulse-integration procedure; the second meth- od proposed at the Vienna Institute of Technology is based on the absolute value of the maximum displacement of a brain when represented by a single degree-of-freedom vibration mode. Some of the assumptions upon which those methods are based will be discussed in this paper. The object of this paper is to analyze those two methods and to present improved measurements of internal head injury hazard. 181</page><page sequence="117">710871-710878 182 710871. (P-39) A Strain Energy Approach to the Me- chanics of Skuli Fracture. J. W. Melvin and F. G. Evans, The University of Michigan. The mechanics of skull fracture in humans has been investigated by many people for over 90 years. A variety of techniques have been used in past studies. Test specimens have been whole cadavers, cadaver heads, skulls and sections of skulls with material conditions including both fresh and embalmed tissue, both dried and moist. Test techniques have incorporated cadaver drop tests, drop towers and universal testing machines with the impacting surfaces including large surfaces, both flat and curved, and localized flat and curved surface. Some of the studies used impact energy as the measured test param- eter, others used impact load and some studies used both quantities to describe the impact. The results of recent studies on the mechanical properties of cranial bone suggest that local values of strain energy density present in the bone of an impacted skull may be the critical parameter in the initiation of skull fracture. It is the purpose of this paper to summarize the results of the large body of information on the phenomenology of skull fracture and then to analyze the results in terms of local strain energy density consid- erations. Based on this reasoning, the differences and similarities between the results of the many different studies are discussed in a qualitative manner. Conclusions are drawn on the influences of such factors as impactor size and shape, skull geometry and soft tissue effects. 710872. (P-39) Michigan Injury Criteria Hypothesis and Restraint System Effectiveness Index. D. H. Robbins and V. L. Roberts, The University of Michigan. This paper describes an injury criteria model implemented in computer language, and a restraint system effectiveness index for evaluating the degree to which the vehicle environment can prevent or reduce occupant injuries. The need for criteria of this type is based on the fact that if the degree of protection offered to a vehicle occupant by a restraint system or a vehicle interior (a function of the distribution and magnitude of the forces transmitted to the occupant) could be expressed in quantitative terms, then, more meaningful comparisons could be made between restraint configurations, and, areas of needed biomechanical research and statistical accident investi- gations could be more readily identified on the basis of the sensitivity of the results when the injury or effectiveness criteria are applied. The injury criteria model consists of three parts: 1. An injury rating based on available human toler- ance data including type of injury, seriousness, and magnitude of physical quantities such as force and acceleration which are related to injury production. 2. A relative motion criterion based on the extent to which adjacent body segments can move with respect to one another. 3. An index giving the probability of the crash event being studied. The analytical effectiveness index is hypothesized to be a function of the parameters defining a restraint environment (occupant, vehicle interior and restraints, and crash definition), the probability that an occupant will be using the vehicle location for which the restraint system is provided, and the probability that the restraint system will be in use by the occupant. The models are based on an extensive review of the literature and examples of their use given. 710873. (P-39) Field Application and Research Devel- opment of the Abbreviated Injury Scale. John D. States, University of Rochester; Harold A. Fenner, Jr., AAAM; Eugene E. Flamboe, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Wilton D. Nelson, General Motors Corp.; and Lee N. Hames, American Medical Assn. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) introduced in January 1968 has been widely used by the Medical Engineering Accident Investigation Teams of the NHTSA, by the General Motors ADAP, by the NATO Country Teams in Europe, and by the AMA Physician-Police Teams. The experience and problems involved in use of the AIS are reviewed. An extended and revised AIS has been devel- oped. Validation studies revealed better than 80% accu- racy by multiple users. The Comprehensive Research Injury Scale (CRIS) has been completed for all major medical specialities. The CRIS separates the various criteria (energy dissipation- ED, threat to life-TL, permanent impairment-PI, treat- ment period-TP, incidence-IN) used with variable quan- tities and frequencies in the AIS. The CRIS identifies and quantitates each scaling criteria permitting more mean- ingful and detailed application of the AIS. 710877. The Challenge Facing the Automotive Industry in the Next Decade. Harold L. Brock, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. This paper discusses the five major factors which combine to face the automotive industry with its greatest challenge to date. The industry will be forced to provide a supply for the great demand of transportation equipment which will develop particularly in nations with growing economies. Mass transportation will be needed to deal with the large number of people moving about in densely populated cities. Humanistic needs must be satisfied by science and technology. Government regulations will demand com- pliance with environmental and safety requirements. College curricula must be reorganized in order to train people to produce products that will satisfy the consumers of the future. 710878. (P-39) The Evaluation of Cerebrovascular Auto- regulation in Head Injury Patients. George T. Tindall, Kinjiro Iwata, Charles P. McGraw and Bettye A. Sayle, University of Texas.</page><page sequence="118">710879-710881 This paper describes autoregulation in 14 severe closed head injury patients. It was found to be present in eight of the patients. On the basis of these tests, the authors conclude that the presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation may be of prognostic value, the absence indicating a functional loss of cerebrovascular activity. Their findings also indicate that loss of autoregulation combined with an elevated ICP will probably lead to death. 710879. (P-39) The Quantification of Internal Head Injury by Means of the Phantom Head and the Impact Assessment Methods. A. Slattenschek, W. Tauffkirchen and G. Benedikter, Vienna Institute of Technology. The requirements made with respect to the phantom head, as well as the impact assessment method in order to obtain realistic test results are indicated. Particular attention is given to the possible measuring errors occurring when using unsuitable phantom bodies. In dealing with the impact assessment methods, those according to C. W. Gadd and the Vienna Institute of Technology are compared with regard to their different assessment and properties. 710880. (P-39) Translational versus Rotational Accel- eration: Animal Experiments with Measured Input. F. J. Unterharnscheidt, University of Texas. Any broadly surfaced impact imparts to the head a force by which it is accelerated. If the impact is directed at the center of mass of a freely movable object, the resulting motion is a translation acceleration. If the impact is directed eccentrically, the result is a combined trans- lational and rotational acceleration. The magnitude of the rotational acceleration is related to the degree of eccen- tricity of the acting force. The magnitude of the trans- lational acceleration is related to the distance between the point of fixation and the center of gravity of the head. The distinction between the two types of acceleration is important in view of the different physical processes they initiate in the brain. Pure translational acceleration creates pressure gradients, while pure rotational accel- eration produces rotation of the skull relative to the brain. Both processes are the effects of mass inertia of the brain. It can be expected, according to the physical analysis of translational and rotation trauma, that different mechanisms produce different patterns of lesions. Experiments with different animal species, which employed translational and rotational accelerations with exactly measured inputs are summarized and the mor- phological alterations in respect to distribution and quality are discussed. 710881. (P-39) A Review of the Severity Index. John Versace, Ford Motor Co. The SAE Severity Index is supposed to be an approx- imation to tolerance limit data, but there are incongruities in its derivation which renders the formula unsupportable. The same logic on which the Severity Index appears to be based can be used to support a wide range of possible values for the exponent on the acceleration, including infinity. This inconsistency results because necessary distinctions have not been made between: (a) the formula for a fitted approximation to the tolerance limit data, (b) the scaling of severity as such, and (c) the measure of the acceleration magnitude of a pulse, the "effective accel- eration." It is recommended that a formula which more literally follows from the tolerance limit data be adopted. In the long run, however, it is believed that a much more appropriate measure of injury severity would result from processing head impact data in such a way as to reflect the probable degree of brain injury. 183</page></plain_text>
