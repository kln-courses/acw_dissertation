<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Immateriality Of Information H. CURTIS WRIGHT The American librarian has never been comfortable with philos ophy. His uneasiness has been expressed by J. Periam Dan ton, who rejects "philosophy in the 'philosophical* or metaphysical sense/'1 and by Henry Bliss, who "eschews metaphysical and mystical philosophy and all its encircling kindred" from Plato to Einstein, but welcomes "the genial and witty wisdom of L'Abbe Dimnet and Will Rogers."2 That continues to be the librarian's standard cop out. He has clearly become a cracker barrel philosopher, for library literature knows vir tually nothing but cook book concepts and department store notions of "philosophy."3 But philosophy should not be written off as useless speculation. It was originally created by the Greeks as a way of solving the complex practical problems of daily life. It was intentionally devised as a re placement for religion, which, as anyone could plainly see, was no longer able to fulfill its promise of doing the same thing. Philosophy thus arose as the Greek attempt to do things right without mysticism or mythology. It was essentially their determined effort to utilize the full resources of human ingenuity as a means of actually accomplish ing what religion had only pretended to deliver. The Greeks always looked on philosophy as a means of dealing with complicated human problems; and if this paper urges the librarian to go back to the freshness and vigor of the Greek intellectual outlook, it is only because the problems of librarianship are both human and complicated, and sorely need the help of philosophy "in the 'philosophical* or meta physical sense." The disjunction of the senses and reason in man is the rock on which the Greeks built natural philosophy. From it derive the one assumption, the two major philosophical systems, and the three specific problems of Greek philosophy, which is quite literally, therefore, as simple as one-two-three. The basic assumption is hylozoism, the belief that matter is alive. The main philosophical systems are (1) scientific materialism, which attempts to explain the phenomenal universe by studying the physical data of sensation, and (2) humanistic imma 297</page><page sequence="2">298 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY terialism, or idealism, which attempts to explain the spiritual nature of man by studying the non-physical forms of human thought.4 The specific problems include the two cosmological questions of ultimate substance and motion, and the anthropological question of human nature: (1) What is the world made out of? (2) Do things exist in a permanent state of Being, or in a temporal process of Becoming? and (3) What is the proper conduct of human life? This simple scheme of Greek philosophy, which set the tone for all subsequent philosophy, still functions as the backdrop for most of the questions philosophers continue to ask today. Philosophy was originally cosmology, which flourished in the cloistered schools of Ionia and southern Italy, and was systematized in the Democritean materialism that leads directly into modern science. But cosmology went into a tail spin of decline at Athens, from which it was not to recover until modern times. It was forced into public view and derailed by idealism, the "anthropocentric attitude to life, which cannot be explained by or derived from anything else, and which pervades everything felt, made, or thought by the Greeks."5 Cosmology was thus unseated by Athenian immaterialism, the potent philosophical tendency of humanism, which diverted the attention of philosophers from the material universe and directed it to "the study of man himself . . . , his nature and place in the world, [and] his relations with his fellows."6 Immaterialism, which was systematized as Platonic idealism, divorced the material concre tions revealed by the senses from the formal abstractions managed by the intellect, regarding the latter as essential and primary, whereas the former were secondary and accidental. And so the Western naturalistic tradition was divided into two camps, the one devoted to the scientific spirituality of matter, and the other to the humanistic spirituality of form. The two types may be clearly discerned among the ancient Greeks. Some defined things with reference to their matter . . . Others saw the essential in purpose or function, with which they included form, for . . . structure subserves function and is dependent upon it. . . . And in answering the eternal question ['What is real?'], the Ionian thinkers and later the atomists gave their reply in terms of matter, the Pythagoreans, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in terms of form.7 All of which raises issues of crucial importance for American li brarianship. What, really, is librarianship? And what is it for} What is the actual object of the librarian's concern, and the proper method</page><page sequence="3">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 299 of study that goes with it? Those are searching philosophical questions; and the librarian's response to them is crucial to the future of li brarianship, because every discipline must have "its own object, method, and mode of procedure and no science can do the work of another."9 But the basic question, I think, is whether librarianship is a materialistic or a formalistic discipline. Our answer to that question will determine the general direction of library development, for "this division of philosophers into materialists and teleologists?matter philosophers and form-pholosophers?is perhaps the most fundamental that can be made in any age, our own included."10 What, then, is the precise relationship of librarianship to the universe of knowledge forms? Do librarians require an intellectual knowledge of things, or a knowledge of intellectual things? Are we supposed to be matter philosophers concerned with concrete physical objects, or form-philoso phers who know the spiritual abstractions of the mind? Are we des tined to become the managers of knowledge records (documents and books), or of knowledge itself (idea complexes)? Is it possible that we have misjudged the actual nature of our own profession by confusing the physics of library operations with the metaphysics of librarian ship? And how in the world do we get to the bottom of issues such as this? Fortunately for us librarians, Abraham Kaplan has probed this very question with a philosophical clarity rarely encountered in library literature.11 But if we are to understand him, we must remember that, with metaphysical questions generally, "the primary opposition which presented itself to the Greek mind was that between matter and form, always with the notion of function included in that of form."12 Li brarianship is classed with the metasciences, according to Kaplan, presisely because none of those disciplines have concrete physical objects characterized by material substance and content. These are sciences not about subject matters provided by man and nature, but about subject matters provided fundamentally by our ideas about man and nature, or by our language, or by our ways of transmitting and processing . . . information. ... I means disciplines like mathematics, logic, linguistics, semantics, . .. theory of information, and maybe cybernetics.13 According to Kaplan, then, librarianship and the metasciences are de rived, not from man and nature in any objective sense, but from hu man ideas, the human languages (both natural and artificial), and the human information processes. And the reason for their abstract</page><page sequence="4">300 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY character is not far to seek: "There is central to them the concept of order, of form, which seems to me to be precisely the central concern also of library science."14 This clearly formulates the issue for li brarians. I am unable to conceptualize any alternative. Either you are interested in [abstract] order, structure, form, or you are inter ested in [concrete] substance and content; and in the latter case you must resign yourself to mastering some increasingly narrow subject area and to doing whatever you can ... as little assistants or magic helpers or something of the kind to the people work ing in the area.15 The only alternative to abstract form as a basis for librarianship "would be a narrow specialism or a really quite impossible encyclo pedism," the latter being "a possibility that has forever vanished," whereas the former "would fail dismally."16 Kaplan's deeply philosophical remarks, however, have been mis interpreted by the unphilosophical among librarians and information scientists alike. The word "about" occurs three times in his discussion of the two kinds of sciences,17 the third time being italicized in "subject matters provided fundamentally by our ideas about man and na ture . . ."18 This unfortunate emphasis has created an "aboutness" mystique based on the distinction between (1) sciences "about subject matters provided by man and nature," and (2) sciences "about subject matters .. . about man and nature." But such a distinction is meaning less, even if it could be made, since Kaplan's whole point is that the metasciences deal with subject matters provided by our ideas: they are formalistic disciplines that study the abstract structure of mentation, not materialistic disciplines that study physical data. His discussion of "the mathematical sciences as a basis for library education"19 does not imply that librarianship is some sort of geometry or algebra. It refers, rather, to the ontological condition of mathematics as a non physical entity made up entirely of spiritual structure and form, with out any material substance or content of its own. The lack of a physical referent somewhere in the material universe is what makes mathematics a metascience rather than a science: its formal objects can be thought, but they cannot be sensed or imagined; nor can they be expressed in materialistic terms, although they are communicable by means of ex pressive vehicles which are themselves physical.</page><page sequence="5">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 301 Excellent examples of mental entities inexpressible in terms or matter are mathematical figures. Although we are constantly seeing sketches of such figures, they cannot actually be drawn. . . . Our sketches are imaginative representations that obey the laws of images. But mathematical figures are simply definitions, concepts in the mind. . . . You can think them, but you cannot express them in terms of matter and its conditions. . . . These mental entities in our minds cannot be represented in terms of matter at all. We cannot imagine them, but we can think them. . . . They are immaterial.20 The objects of mathematics are thus abstract constructs, forms that exist solely in the mind.21 And this "mathematical condition" is gen eralizable, not only to Kaplan's metasciences, but to all disciplines that have formalistic (non-physical) objects, as opposed to materialistic (physical) objects. It therefore includes librarianship and the meta sciences, as well as the human arts, literature, and philosophy.22 It also includes the study of information itself, which may be described as the metascience par excellence. Ancient cosmology was permanently transformed by its confronta tion with Athenian immaterialism. It could never be the same again, because "such an exclusive devotion to external nature as was ex hibited by the Ionians became for ever impossible after . . . the im portunate questionings of Socrates which brought human life into the very centre of the picture."23 Something like that has to happen to librarianship, in my opinion, and the sooner the better. Librarians have been wrong in their persistent attempts to find "scientific" solu tions to their fundamental problems. Librarianship is an abstract structure of formal order relationships, which belongs in the intellec tual spirit world of Plato, along with the librarian. In Kaplan's formu lation, "the humanistic basis is there and will and must remain as a basis."24 Let us not misunderstand him. He plainly means, not that librarians are humanists by choice, but that the real object of their interest is the noetic structure of the human mind; and that is a problem inherent in the nature of man, not a cosmological problem. Information science, as presently constituted, seems to understand neither the formalism of information nor the materialism of science. Its computer technology, for example, does a magnificent job of push ing characters around; but it cannot negotiate the tricky interface be tween the concrete data of verbal expression and the abstract mean ings of words.25 Information exists only in minds. It comes through the physical media of human expression, but does not originate or</page><page sequence="6">302 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY reside within them. It has no phenomenal basis in the material world, a fact that disqualifies it sensu stricto as a science. This is an important point, because the proper structuring and organization of method in any discipline is determined by the nature of its object. But the ab stract nature of information continues to elude the information sci entists. Robert Hayes and Joseph Becker, for example, insist that " 'information' does not exist in abstract form but only as data re corded in some record." These authors acknowledge that " 'informa tion' has had a variety of meanings," and that "philosophers may well claim that it is a something with which they have struggled for years." But they are nevertheless manufacturing a non-existent physical refer ent for information when they define it in terms of data, "the raw ma terial" from which "information, knowledge, and wisdom" are derived. "The data may . . . represent 'facts,' as statements of truth, but more generally it is anything recorded in a form that can be processed." Information is thus "the data produced as a result of a process upon data," which may constitute a process of transmitting, selecting, or ganizing, or analyzing data.26 The trouble with all this, of course, is that information cannot be identified with the data of informational expression. Information, like mathematics itself, has no data. It con stitutes the proper object of a deeply philosophical discipline with a recognitive methodology, but it cannot function as the basis of a sci ence which must operate on the principle of matter "to which . . . physical things are analytically reducible."27 In a very real sense, there is only one system of philosophy, the human information system. All of the philosophical systems are ways of thinking about something, and therefore "have their root in the human mind," as does philosophy itself.28 Jesse Shera has argued that, above all else, the librarian, like the philosopher, should be "a mis sionary of the human mind."29 There is no escaping the epistemolog ical implications of this and similar considerations. Whereas librarian ship can be studied scientifically as an existential object, or as a social phenomenon, its nature can best be studied, perhaps, as an integral part of the larger study of the nature of man which contains it. This is essentially the philosophical study of human information processes, not the scientific study of data. The natures of man and information are probably the same thing, just as librarianship and philosophy may turn out to be, not merely similar, but identical.30 And since all of this pertains directly to human thought and knowledge, let us begin with the human intelligence and its possibilities of communicating and knowing.</page><page sequence="7">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 303 Human conscious existence, as we know it, is ultimately a dualism consisting of (1) an abstract thinking apparatus (the human intelli gence), and (2) a concrete technology of action (the human body).31 This dualism exists, in turn, within the material world, which, in con junction with the body, constitutes the sensory ambience of the intel ligence. The possibility of communication between the intelligence and its sensory ambience also exists, therefore, because it has the capacity to exercise at least a limited control over material. It can contemplate the forms of its environment by means of the bodily senses, or, by using the hands or vocal organs of the body, create its own oral and visual forms in the atmosphere and solid matter of its ambience. It can also think independently: it can lay its sensory instruments aside, as it were, and think abstractly about what it has already observed or otherwise remembers, or what it can imagine. The human conscious intelligence thus has two basic informational systems at its disposal: (1) the sensory system, with both impressive and expressive subsystems, and (2) the noetic system, with its capacity of independent reflection. The precise relationship between these two systems remains unknown, however, and it may or may not be true that human mentation, as we know it, is ultimately dependent upon sensation as food for thought. The sole capacity of the human intelligence is its ability to manage form, either by discerning or creating its material manifestations within the sensory ambience, or by manipulating its non-material manifestations in some abstract system. It can therefore manage only the dual realizations of material and ideal form; and that limitation imposes the severest constraint of all on the possibilities of human knowledge. Because of it, there are two basic kinds of truth, knowledge, thought, and education. The two kinds of truth are (1) concrete (ex periential, artistic), and (2) abstract (intellectual, scientific), the former being true to the perceiver's experience of something, whereas the latter refers to the objective realities of perceived entities. The dianoetic options are to think (1) experimentally, or (2) theoretically, the one being inductive and empirical, the other deductive and logical. Knowledge is either (1) direct (concrete, experiential) or (2) indirect (abstract, theoretical). We can learn (1) by doing (directly, experi entially), or (2) by thinking (indirectly, reflectively). And we can teach (1) imagistically, through experiential involvement, mimesis, conditioning, etc., or (2) conceptually, by rational explanation, the encouragement of critical reflection and so on. The human mind is thus a thoroughgoing informational dualism; and the bond that ties the two kinds of truth, thought, knowledge, and education into a com</page><page sequence="8">304 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY prehensive and comprehensible unity is the sensory-noetic disjunction. The ability to understand the respective functions of the senses and reason in human thought is thus the key to the entire scientiae philosophia understood in the widest possible sense. It has the po tential of creating a critical Studienswissenschaft that can explain the nature of the human interest in anything by clarifying the relationship between the subjective processes of knowing and the objective condi tions of being known. It could create, in short, a new critical librarian ship, a comprehensive informational synthesis in which all knowledge is located and correlated. Plato, for all his fulminations against the poets, was himself an artist by temperament who "originally wanted to become a poet of tragedies,"32 and who, as a young man, wrote considerable amounts of poetry in genres ranging from epic to epigrammatic. He not only became "a writer of incomparable skill, but was, by native gift, a poet and a thinker no less subtle than Socrates himself."33 And when he turned to philosophy, therefore, he instinctively selected a dramatic method for the presentation of his thought. He possessed above all else the artistic sensitivity to form, which determined to a very large extent the content of his subject matter, the principle of his ideal Forms, the constitution of his theoretical republic, his understanding of pleasure, and his concept of the highest good. Form, in a word, was everything to Plato, and anything material was second rate. The physical medium of human expression was certainly not the formal message, but only a kind of necessary nuisance: it was requisite for communicating the forms of reality, but always distorted the forms it communicated.34 Plato thus makes a clear distinction between form and the expression of form. His unexpressed Forms are "the unchanging, primary patterns of things,"35 whereas their expression in any com municative system reduces them to the secondary status of derived ma terial forms. The "real" forms of art, therefore, "are like the ideal image in the head of the artist, to which he endeavours to give a ma terial form."36 The business of the expressive artist, furthermore, is not to "copy" the actualities of nature, but to communicate everything ideally Greek by portraying the universal essence in the particular work of art. That is precisely what Plato was trying to do in philoso phy, and what he expected of literature and art. This attitude explains why he praised Polygnotos, "the good artist who paints a model of what might be the most beautiful human being," and contemned the sophistic Zeuxis "who took delight in the portrayal of the individual, concrete object, painting grapes with such an illusion of reality that</page><page sequence="9">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 305 birds came to peck at them."37 It also explains why he relegated the artistic "copyist" of nature to "the third place as seen from the king and truth."38 Ever since Plato separated the abstractions of unexpressed form from the concrete expressions of form, Western philosophers from Aristotle to Whitehead and beyond have debated the implications of that separation. Does the unsensed world of form completely transcend the material world of the senses (Plato), or is the former immanent within the latter (Aristotle)? The Socratic humanism of Plato was never abandoned by Aristotle; but when it came to the ideal Forms the scientist in him was stronger than in Plato and would not be bullied by the humanist.39 Plato's theory of Ideas had both objective and subjective aspects, it is true;40 and "Plato and Aristotle, while not neglecting the problems of human life, were both interested in specu lation about the world."41 But in addition to all this, Aristotle had also assimilated the systematic philosophy of Democritus and had a strong materialistic side, whereas Plato's heart was not really in cosmology. Their disagreement over the world of Forms, therefore, is best explained by their humanistic and scientific temperaments.42 "For Plato indeed the human soul was at the centre;"43 but "the native bent of Aristotle's mind was in the other direction, towards the study of empirical fact."44 Platonism "is undoubtedly a two-world philoso phy, and anyone whose thoughts are confined to this world can never hope to understand it;"45 but "Aristotle is a man of this world, with no longing to escape from it into another. On the contrary, he is al ways trying to get back to this world, to escape from the other-world liness of Plato."46 Plato "distrusts and condemns the senses. The eyes and ears are not, for the Platonist, windows of the soul, opening upon reality;"47 but for Aristotle, "the field of knowledge, awairing his eager exploration, lies within nature as revealed by the senses;"48 the path of knowledge begins with "the evidence our senses give us, and must return to it again, with a fuller understanding that will justify the facts of observation."49 Plato is the supreme philosophical advocate of anthropological humanism; "but in Aristotle the taste for the dis interested investigation of nature for its own sake reached its height."50 And from their day to this the telic temperament has sought its ex planations in the functions and purposes of things, while the scientist has looked to their origins and causes. This question of looking for the essence of things in the [mat ter] 'out-of-which' or the [form] 'into-which' introduces us to a</page><page sequence="10">306 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY fundamental cleavage of outlook which exists in the present world as in the ancient, among laymen as well as philosophers. ... And it is notoriously impossible for the one side to convince the other by argument.51 The "ultimate reason" for an individual's preference for one of these approaches over the other, according to Guthrie, "is probably not rational;"52 but this we must reject. There are more probably two reasons for the choice: (1) the individual's temperament, and (2) the nature of the problem that interests him. If we may trust the human istic and scientific instincts of Plato and Aristotle respectively, we can perhaps explain the relationship of the sensed and unsensed worlds this way: for the scientific temperament seriously interested in the problems of the cosmos it is better to think of form in matter; but the humanist interested in man is better off thinking of form and matter. They are both right in their respective spheres. The influence of Plato has remained substantial. According to Whitehead's very Platonic discussion of "fact and form," all of the Western philosophies are still Platonistic in one way or another. The safest general characterization of the European philo sophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. ... By stating my belief that the train of thought in these [cosmolological] lectures is Platonic, I am . . . expressing the hope that it falls within the European tradition. But I do mean more: I mean that if we had to render Plato's general point of view . . ., we should have to set about the construction of a philosophy of organism. In such a philosophy the actualities constituting the process of the world are conceived as exemplify ing the ingression (or "participation") of other things which con stitute the potentialities of definiteness for any actual existence. The things which are temporal arise by their participation in the things which are eternal.53 But if the spirit of Plato is evident in modern cosmology, it is even more apparent in the study of human phenomena. His insistence that form is distinct from the expression of form, for example, has great meaning for linguistics and the humanities, although its importance is more readily perceived in the latter than in the former.54 It means that thought is fundamentally different from the expression of thought in any material system whatever, whether verbal, mathematical, artistic, behavioral, or otherwise. For linguistics this means that language and the expression of language should be carefully differentiated, and that</page><page sequence="11">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 307 language cannot be defined in terms of speech or any other expressive mechanism. It is a mental system belonging to the Logos, which, though "originally oral speech with the Greeks," becomes in Plato "a living thing, pre-existing, as it were, before particular verbal expres sions."55 This was clearly understood by the Swiss linguist Saussure, the founder of structural linguistics. Language may be compared to an algebra having only diordinal terms. Among its oppositions, some are more significant than others; but the [immaterial] unities and [physical] facts of gram mar are only different names for different aspects of the same general fact: the interplay of linguistic oppositions. The unities and facts of grammar would not be confused if linguistic signs were composed of something other than differ ences. ... In other words, language is form, not substance. . . . We must get this truth through our heads, for all of our termi nological mistakes, all of our wrong ways of referring to the elements of language, derive from this spurious assumption that the linguistic phenomenon is a thing of substance.56 Ferdinand de Saussure "did not live to draw the full theoretical con sequences of his discovery,"57 however, and his followers wrongly equated speech with language and excluded writing from it. But his theory of language as form surfaced again in the forties when it be came "essential to find out a positive answer as to the exact place of writing within the scale of the facts of language."58 The meaning of "this extraordinarily happy formulation," according to H. J. Uldall, is that language "is something apart from the substance in which it is manifested, an abstract system which is not defined by the substance, but which, on the contrary, forms the substance and defines it as such."59 The physical mechanism for producing the expressive signs of language is therefore wholly secondary (and largely irrelevant) to the abstract system itself, "for it is not an intrinsic concern of the sys tem."60 It is only through the concept of a difference between form and substance that we can explain the possibility of speech and writing existing at the same time as expressions of one and the same language. If either of these two substances, the stream of air or the stream of ink, were an integral part of the language itself, it would not be possible to go from one to the other with out changing the language.61</page><page sequence="12">308 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY "This principle is so essential," Saussure tells us, "that it applies to all of the material elements of language, even to the phonemes;"62 and Uldall elaborates on that. It is this concept of form and substance which underlies, also, the phoneme theory. The phoneme . . . can be briefly explained as follows: the . . . sounds used in actual speech . . . belong to gether in groups in such a way that the members of . . . the same group can be exchanged without any change of meaning, while the interchange of two sounds belonging to different groups may lead to a change of meaning. In other words, there is a something which remains constant when you exchange within the same group, but which changes when you go from one group to another, and which, consequently, must ... be common to all the sounds belonging to one group. This some thing is evidently not meaning. . . . In continuation of Saussure I would suggest that our some thing is a form?a form which is independent of the particular substance in which it is manifested, and which is defined only by its functions [in relation] to other forms of the same order. The form, then, will remain the same even if we change the substance, as long as we do not interfere with its function.63 There is thus no unique linguistic substance without which language would cease to be language. Speech and writing are the most common material systems utilized by language for expressing its utterances, and "it is illegitimate to consider either of them primary. They simply coexist."64 The basic utterances of language, therefore, "are of two different kinds, i.e. spoken and written utterances,"65 whose differences of substance also create functional differences of production and reso lution in the communications process.66 Joseph Vachek has described their productive functions. The function of the spoken utterance is to respond to the given stimulus (which, as a rule, is urgent) in a dynamic way, i.e. quickly, readily, and with equal attention to both the intellec tual and the emotional factors of the situation that gave rise to the stimulus. On the other hand, the function of the written utterance is to respond to the given stimulus (which, as a rule, is not urgent) in a static way, that is to say, the response would be permanent (i.e. preservable), affording full comprehension as well as clear survey of the situation concerned, and stressing the intellectual factors of the situation that gave rise to the stimulus.67</page><page sequence="13">IMMATERIALITY OF INFORMATION 309 Vachek indicates that "each of the two kinds of utterances has its own standard ... as spoken language or written language,"68 and also de scribes their functions of communicative input. The two ways of realizing utterances . . . differ not only in their respective materials but also in their immediate aims: the writ ten realizations are intended for reading (i.e. for getting full, surveyable information, the wording of which can be easily controlled at any later time), whereas the spoken realizations are intended for listening (i.e. for getting quick, ready informa tion, often coloured by emotional factors).69 It would seem that, linguistically speaking at least, Plato's disjunc tion of form and the expression of form is correct in all of its essentials. Language really is structure and form, not material substance; and there is a very real difference between language and the expression of language. The generalized version of Saussure's formalism of language is nothing more nor less than the human information problem itself. Information, too, is Platonic form, not Democritean substance; and, like language, it may be expressed or unexpressed.70 It has many meanings, but remains "a term ... for which there are few defini tions."71 It is best defined, perhaps, from the word itself: the verbal meaning of "in-FORM-ation" is "the production of form in." To "inform" someone is quite literally to "create form in" him; and the sensory modes of communication are both ancillary to that possibility and the means of its achievement.72 This view of information is es sentially Plato's broad approach to the myriad problems of noetic form.73 It is concerned with all of the human mentifacts, whether sub jective, reified, effable, or ineffable, and pertains to humane concerns as well as to the objects of science. This is the long view of informa tion which must ultimately resolve the complex problems of librarian ship, if they can ever be resolved. A shorter view, meanwhile, is taking shape in information science.74 It derives almost exclusively from scientific interest in the cosmos. But the Platonistic sensitivity to form has never been a strong point with scientists. Information, according to this view, "is inherently utilitarian" and "instrumental,"75 which im plies that it is matter-of-fact, down-to-earth, and practical, as opposed to aesthetic, and that it is regarded as a means, not an end. It is valued for making, doing, or achieving something, and there is no such thing as informatio gratia informationis. It therefore "promotes adaptive behavior," and "utility is its major criterion of social value."76 This is</page><page sequence="14">310 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY the Baconian interpretation of information that is becoming widely accepted by librarians.77 It reveals all of the presuppositions of science and has two serious weaknesses: (1) it attempts the scientific analysis of information, a human problem if there ever was one; and (2) it badly needs supplementing, perhaps even challenging, by non-scientific points of view. Its implicit assumption is that information is concrete physical substance, not abstract spiritual form. If the argument of this paper is correct throughout, it would seem to mean that the entire in formation science movement is misconceived, since information is noetic form; and form precisely qua form cannot be the proper object of a science, which must have a physical referent (phenomenal base) in the material universe. Physical substance is the direct object of study in the sciences; but in the arts it is the means of studying form. In formation in the humanities, for example, tends to be its own end. Art has great meaning for human beings; but it does not refer to any thing outside itself: it is what it means, and its meaning cannot be looked up in the dictionary or anywhere else. The humanistic recogni tion of non-physical structure and form can hardly be equated with the scientific description of physical substance and content. The ex pressive vehicle of information, on the other hand, can be studied scientifically; and that seems to be what the information scientists are actually studying. NOTES 1. J.

There are two additional systems which constitute the sophic and mantic objections to Greek natural philosophy. Skepticism is the destructive relativism of the sophistic movement which denies the possibility of knowledge derived from the data of reason, or of the senses, or of both; it may be described as horizontal and naturalistic.

That "man is the centre of their thought" is evident from "their anthropomorphic gods; their concentration on . . . the human form in sculpture and . . . painting; the logical sequence by which their philosophy moved from the problem of the cosmos to the problem of man . . . ; their poetry, whose inexaustible theme from Homer throughout all the succeeding centuries is man, his destiny and his gods; and finally their state, which cannot be understood unless viewed as a force which shaped man and man's life?all these are separate rays from one great light," ibid. Jaeger also measures the hellenocentrism of the modern Western nations by their approximation to the anthropocentric ideal, "Classical philology and humanism," Transactions of the American Philological Association 67 (1936): 374. 6.

The social sciences can go either way, because (1) they are hybrid disciplines which occupy the no man's land between the humanities and the sciences, and (2)</page><page sequence="16">312 THE JOURNAL OF LIBRARY HISTORY they study human phenomena derived from human beings, those marvelously com plicated combinations of spiritual form and physical substance. 23.

The relationship between the physical "body" of a word and the abstract meaning of its "spirit" is not only arbitrary but variable in any natural language. The inner logos of a word, therefore, can never be inferred from its physical mechanics, although it can be changed without even touching the word itself. In the sentence "There is a bridge in my town," for example, the meaning of "bridge" is drastically altered by changing "town" to "mouth" or "song." Thus when the computer is used in word searching, it is like a mouse that locates all the oc currences of "bridge" in a file without having the slightest inkling of its meaning in any of its specific instances. 26.

These data-oriented definitions are retained and expanded in the second edition of this work (Los Angeles: Melville, 1974), p. 660, where information is regarded as "a very ambigu ous term," occasionally interpreted [wrongly?] "as a rather mystical meaning or content of data." 27.

"It is evident that these systems have their roots in the very nature of the human mind, that they belong to the human mind itself. . . . What can be the true parent of all philo sophical systems, if not the human mind? ... To search in the human spirit for the roots of philosophical systems is, therefore, . . . simply to search for effects in their causes; it is to derive the history of philosophy from its most elevated, most certain source," ibid., 344. All of the philosophical systems, therefore, are variations of idealism, in one way or another. The human mind "is at once the subject and the necessary instrument of philosophy;" it constitutes in effect "the original of which philosophy is the more or less exact, more or less complete, representation," ibid. 29.

Both Plato and Aristotle spoke of the body as the physical instrumentality of the soul. See Guthrie, Greek Philosophers, pp. 142-43; and E.

"For Plato it is sense-perception that recalls to us the eternal ideas," Guthrie, Greek Philosophers, p. 120. Italics mine. Plato completely separates the worlds mediated by reflection and sensation, and implies that the perfections of the former cannot be adequately communicated by the imperfections of the latter.

Aristotle's disagreement with Plato over the relationship of the two worlds is an internal dispute, however, not a denial of Platonism.

There are, on the one hand, literally hundreds of astute studies of the vari ous material media in which art is expressed; but on the other hand, "the sub stance of ink has not received the same attention on the part of linguists that they have so lavishly bestowed on the substance of air," H. J. Uldall, "Speech and writ ing," in Eric P. Hamp, Fred W. Householder, and Robert Austerlitz, eds., Readings in linguistics II (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1967): 148. So far so good. But Uldall then makes the brash statement that air and ink behave "in much the same way," and that "from a linguistic point of view, a bad pen is quite parallel to a sore throat or a cigar between the teeth," ibid. This is quite typical of linguistic statements about the material media in which language is expressed. The artistic equivalent would be: "Tones and canvas behave in much the same way," and "from an artistic point of view, a bad brush is quite parallel to a squeaky violin or hiccups in a vocalist." 55.

"Proof of this is the latitude of pronunciation enjoyed by individuals within the range of sounds that remain dis tinct from other sounds. . . . Language is in no way hampered by this; it does not require, as one might imagine, that sound have an invariant quality, but only that it can be differentiated," Saussure, Cours de linguistique generate, pp. 164-65. 64. Uldall, "Speech and writing," p. 149, "We can invent . . . new systems of expression manifested in any other way, such as flag wagging or dancing, and they will all be adequate, if they fulfill the single condition of providing a sufficient number of units to express the units of content. . . .

"It must be borne in mind that members of a cultural linguistic com munity are, as a matter of fact, something like bilinguists because they command two standards of language. . . . The coexistence of these two standards, as well as the complimentariness of their functions (one of them is used for the static, the other for the dynamic response), necessarily result in a mutual interdependence being felt between them," ibid., 156. 69. Ibid., p. 154. 70. Shera's generic definition of information as "that which is transmitted by the act or process of communication" is therefore inadequate, since it is limited to in formational expression, Shera, Foundations of education for librarianship, p. 164. 71. Ibid. 72. Information appears to mean "the creation of form in" no matter how you look at it, whether form is created in man or in the cosmos by whatever means both internal and external to the soul, or even in subhuman life or inanimate nature. Nay, more: it pertains to creating form in all of the physical media of communications, human or otherwise, and even to the "little black box" of tech nology, which converts informational expression into photons and electro-magnetic impulses, bounces it off the moon, and so on. 73.
