<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frazer strikes back from the armchair: a new search for the animist soul* Rane Willerslev University of Oslo The question which runs throughout this talk can be stated in stark form: is it a mistake to take our interest in an ethnographic phenomenon in the direction of empirical investigation when what is really needed with respect to its clarity is an imaginative contemplation of it? It is my overall argument that the Malinowskian recourse to ethnographical evidence is misguided. As an example, I take the animist conception of 'soul'. I will show how it is essentially an imaginary issue. Rendering it intelligible, therefore, involves launching a speculative investigation into the source of its origin. This finds an echo in Frazer, the last survivor of the old 'armchair school'. His style of anthropology was marked by a deliberate speculative interrogation of cross-cultural ethnography - a process whereby abstract thinking gives force and meaning to ethnographic observations. Let me say how honoured I feel by the invitation to deliver the Malinowski Memorial Lecture. Honoured, but also a little anxious. For I have been foolish enough to use this opportunity to question the ethnographic tradition of Bronislaw Malinowski. Indeed, the problem I want to consider here is one of key importance to him. It has to do with the relation between speculative imagination and ethnographic observation. The crux of my argument will be to show that we will get nowhere if we confine ourselves to a trust in the concreteness of ethnographic facts. Instead I will seek to convince you that every manifestation of actual social life is more or less adequately expressive of a virtual totality or all-inclusive force, which operates on a purely imaginative plane and which cannot, therefore, be the object of direct observation or first-hand experience. Anthro pological insight into the starting-point of social life may, then, begin not from what we conventionally regard as the solidity of actual empirical observation, but, on the contrary, from the scholar's speculative imagination. In proposing this rather reverse take on anthropology, which we conventionally think of as an empiricist social science, I do not mean to deny the achievements of Malinowski's ethnographic method, which brought and continues to bring forth a very rich harvest of ethnographic data. My quarrel is not with ethnography as such, or with the value of prolonged fieldwork. Rather, it is with our discipline's increasing tendency * Malinowski Memorial Lecture 2010.

Malinowski stands among the strongest bearers of this development as a reaction against the large-scale comparative scholarship of the kind engaged in by nineteenth-century 'armchair anthropologists' like James Frazer.1 While the latter deliberately subordinated ethno graphic data to speculative theory by bundling together historically and geographically disparate materials with little concern for the specificities of the multiple contexts he traversed, Malinowski stressed intensive fieldwork in one culture and the analysis of cultural phenomena in terms of their function within that culture.2 While Malinowski himself was not entirely plain with regard to his criticism of Frazer's comparative generalizations (Stocking 1995: 234), his disapproval may have stemmed from much the same concerns that Clifford Geertz (1973: 25) later aired against the comparative method: it invariably proves inaccurate or tendentious (Geertz 1973: 43). It is somehow inseparable from the particulars that yield it and, when separated, turns out to be banal and empty (Geertz 1995: 25). And above all, by comparing anything and everything in the expectation of finding universals, one inevitably misses the distinctiveness of the particulars amassed (Geertz 1973: 43). These reservations continue to define present-day anthropology's attitude towards comparative generalizations (Ingold 2008; Rosenau 1992:105). One thinks, for exam ple, of Geertz's (1985) famous statement that what anthropologists do best is to grasp 'local knowledge', which has largely been interpreted to mean that 'we should abandon explicit comparison in favour of rich, complex, highly particularized ethnographic descriptions' (Keane 2008: S112). Frazer and the large-scale armchair speculation of which he was such a superlative proponent have become the objects of ridicule (Ingold 2008: 82). 'Contemporary anthropologists', as Edmund Leach wrote back in 1966, but which is equally valid today (see Strathern 1987: 252), 'consider Malinowski to be a major figure ... Frazer is ... worth mentioning only because he was in grievous error' (Leach 1966: 560). And this image, which Malinowski also was eager to cement (Kuper 1983: 1-35), has become enshrined in the very creation myth of modern anthropology itself (Boon 1982: 9-21): the anthropologist must get out of his 'com fortable position in the long chair' (Malinowski 1926: 126) and live it. Only by living a way of life can he get a sober and considered account of it without falsification (Jarvie 1984 [1964]: 3) Yet it is exactly here that we begin to glimpse the problem that motivates my writing of this lecture. For we may ask if anthropology is not overstating the self sufficiency of its ethnographic knowledge-making practice when it downsizes its interpretative efforts to situate empirical findings within contexts. The consequence of this primacy of the particular, it seems to me, is what Anna Tsing (2004: 88) has recently denoted as a disinclination on anthropology's part to engage with putative universals. I for my part pose this critical question not in the name of a 'back to Frazer' (Jarvie 1984 [1964]: 175) movement, at least not in any direct way. The distinctive value of large-scale comparative scholarship lies, as I will explain below, not in the expectation of ranking cultural phenomena in evolutionary terms, but rather in the belief that juxtaposing phenomena bearing a cross-cultural resemblance can be a particularly thought-provoking, creative venture, which may potentially re-open new insights into the very issue of what constitutes the real. There is, in other words, a distinctive Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="3">506 Rane Willerslev imaginative power in the comparative moment itself, which I hope to unfold fully by the end of this essay. The virtually real If I have one more hope for this essay, it is that it might make a contribution to the connection that has existed and still potentially exists between philosophy and anthro pology. While ethnographic fieldwork has given us a sense of the variety and richness of cultural phenomena, certain thinkers within philosophy have given us a better sense of ways of envisioning these phenomena as a kind of intellectual enterprise (Schrempp 1992). Here I am mainly thinking of Gilles Deleuze (1994), who, I believe, provides a perspective propitious for beginning the task of challenging our ethnographically received understandings of what constitutes reality. Indeed, Deleuze's basic distinction between the 'virtual' and the 'actual' will figure centrally in the discussion that follows and a few clarifying remarks are needed at this point. That something is actual prin cipally means that it exists in the conventional sense of being empirically present - that it can be experienced, observed, and so on. The virtual, by contrast, does not share any of these characteristics. It is rather like a 'phantom ideal' (Derrida 1995: 244), which does not exist in the conventional sense of being physically given or presented, but can only be imagined as a kind of unthinkable abstraction or paradox, working on a purely spiritual plane. This, however, does not make the virtual unreal. The recent evolution of the word's general meaning - in phrases like virtual reality - unhelpfully associates it with the artificial or merely superficial. But the word's older, now archaic meaning relates it to the possession of inherent virtues or power (Hallward 2006:30). It is this older meaning that I want to bring across to reveal how the force of the virtual in an important sense is more real than its actual manifestations: what we do, how we live our lives - despite its seeming solidity and determination - is in fact a product of the virtual that origi nates in what Deleuze (20050: 84; 2005b: 142), following the image of Henri Bergson (1988 [1896]: 198), refers to as 'the dawn of our human experience'. The virtual, in other words, constitutes the primordial groundwork of the observable world's actual living manifestations - that is, their real starting-point or origin. It is important to note, however, that the kind of interest that I bring to philosophy is not the same as the philosopher's. I am not concerned with the internal coherence of Deleuze's thinking or with his position within the larger body of philosophy. My concern is simply to use him as a source of inspiration for challenging basic anthro pological understandings of what constitutes the genuinely real in human existence. I will exemplify this point by addressing one of anthropology's earliest concepts, if not the first, namely the 'soul' that, as Edward B. Tylor (1958 [1871], vol. 2: 2, 429) pointed out, sits at the heart of 'animism': the 'primitive' inclination to 'impute a soul to that which empirically does not have one' (Stringer 1999: 552). I will show how the animist soul is impregnated with virtual force, which effectively situates it outside the zone of empirical investigation. This preoccupation with seeking the origins of phenomena by way of cross-cultural comparison finds an echo in Frazer, the last survivor of the old 'armchair school'. Frazer's bookish style of doing anthropology was marked by bold speculative interro gations into cross-cultural ethnography - a process whereby uncertain leaps of his own vivid imagination gave force and meaning to the various ethnographic observations at his disposal. This speculative methodology can clearly be detected in his masterpiece, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="4">Frazer strikes back from the armchair 507 The Golden Bough (1959 [1911]), which I will turn to discuss in some detail below, because 'whatever anthropologists do, they seldom read Frazer' (Boon 1982:19). Is Frazer worth recovering? I suspect that my aim of awakening Frazer's legacy as a source of inspiration will provoke frightening and perhaps even spiteful associations of an extremely old fashioned anthropology, full of'undisguised contempt for "primitive" society' (Douglas 1966: 24). To dispel any misunderstandings, let me at once point out that my reflections on Frazer do not imply that I take his imperial evolutionism to be 'right' and its critics to be 'wrong'. Such an attempt at restoring Frazer's evolutionist legacy has already been pursued, and renewed, by I.C. Jarvie (1984 [1964]: 175) and I think with little success. In my view, Frazer's assumptions as to how societies pass through the same stages of development, with the added assumption that this development is necessarily in the direction of intellectual and moral progress, are not simply erroneous but frankly absurd when judged by modern standards of ethnographic knowledge. Thus, if Frazer's comparative legacy is to be appreciated at all, his evolutionism cannot be part of what is recovered. This, however, is not an impossible task. In an article convincingly defending the comparative method against evolution, Robert A. Segal (2001) points out that cross cultural comparison is in itself simply an attempt to find similarities, not to rank them. 'The parallels it finds are thematic, not necessarily causal. The discovery of parallels demands an explanation but does not itself provide one' (Segal 2001: 347). Thus, cross-cultural comparison is itself neutral. It is a tool to be used with or without an evolutionary framework. Then what about the other great marker of Frazerian anthropology, the search for human origins (Frazer 1931 [1922]: 248)? Functionalism, as propounded by Malinowski, rejected all attempts at conjecturing human origins where there is no information based on reliable historical records (Evans-Pritchard 1965: 29). In this way, the entire approach of Frazer, who relied on an authentic knowledge of a period of human history to which we have no access, was rejected. However, one may ask if the question of origins really is a historical one, in the same way as, for instance, the fall of Rome or of Constantinople. I don't think so. History is by its very nature a recording of actual events that took place in lived time and space. But actuality is, as already pointed out, unfolded from a virtual beginning. This virtual force cannot be accounted for by any strict causality or chronological sequence. Nor is it connected to any specific body or place. Strictly speaking, then, origins have no history (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1994:110-11) and cannot be accounted for by any historical proofs (Eliade 1964: 159). Thus, we are forced to renounce Frazer's old dream of grasping the origins of religion with the aid of historical tools. What we need, instead, is a theory of origins as the virtual power of creation, where it is a question not of history or evolution, but of subtracting the very source of creation from the mediation of the created - that is, to uncover the dependence of the actual upon the virtual (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1994: 58,140). Frazerian metaphysics We may detect such potential in Frazer if we cease focusing on what he did and instead look into the somewhat odd way he did it. Here I am primarily thinking about his intellectualist commitment to what could be denoted the 'speculative imagination'. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17,504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="5">508 Rane Willerslev It is well known that Frazer's access to 'the native's point of view' was not born out of field studies, but involved his own speculative projection of meaning onto the eth nographic data provided to him by missionaries and imperial officials. This specula tive dimension to Frazer's work is strongly present in his masterpiece The Golden Bough (Fig. 1). Throughout the thirteen volumes, there is a plenitude of comparative, essentially daring speculations as to the origins of various primitive, archaic, and current rituals, beliefs, and religious institutions. All of them he eventually interprets as variations on the antique theme of the sacred priesthood of Nemi and with it the legend of the Golden Bough, which must be broken before the combat for the succession to the priesthood can take place. Malinowski used exactly this phantasm of the priesthood's archaic and universal presence to dismiss Frazer: 'Metaphysical considerations of cabinet thinkers', he dis dainfully declared (quoted in Brozi 1992: 363). Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown, in conversa tion with Max Gluckman, nicknamed Frazer's mode of reasoning 'if-I-were-a-horse' (quoted in Downie 1970: 42) and E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1965: 25) famously compared it to myth-making: a 'just-so-story' like 'how the leopard got its spots'. I will not deny that the lack of any positive evidence for pointing to the remote and long-forgotten origins of religiosity suggests a major problem for Frazer's historicist evolutionism. It is interesting to note, however, that his way of coping with this draw back is to develop a mythological picture (or at least an epic that is highly mythically tinged) of a prehistoric past, which seems to suggest that empirical or fact-driven accounts cannot stand alone. We need stories too! Here is a fragment of this once famous beginning, depicting the sacred king of Nemi awaiting his murderous contestant: Figure 1. Frazer begins his large-scale comparative study of religion looking at Turner's picture of the Golden Bough. Turner was a painter of stories set in landscapes: a grandiose mythologist. In citing Turner at the very beginning, Frazer might simply be announcing the kind of book it actually is - The Golden Bough may be disguised as a work of science, but in reality it is a vast mythological prose.

The dreamy blue of Italian skies, the dappled shade of summer woods, and the sparkle of waves in the sun, can have accorded but ill with that stern and sinister figure (Frazer 1959 [1911]: 1-2). Frazer's writings stimulated a number of writers, including D.H. Lawrence (2000: 127) and T.S. Eliot, whose poem The Waste Land (1922) is perhaps the best example of Frazerian literary influence. However, in anthropology, his fine prose has been much criticized for being too literary. As Marilyn Strathern writes in her Frazer Lecture, published in 1987: Difficulties arise when the apparent facts of a case are altered or distorted for the sake of a particular effect. Frazer is certainly guilty of this charge; he did not strive for a 'plain account'. Thus he has been accused not simply of creating an atmosphere of romantic savagery but of tampering with his source material too (1987: 256). The question is why Frazer did not 'strive for a plain account' - among other means by 'treating events, behaviour, dogma, rites out of context' (Strathern 1987: 254, emphasis in original). Strathern points out that we have too easily overlooked the fact that the context of phenomena does not exist out there for us to grasp but is itself the result of 'the relationships between writer, reader, and subject matter' (1987: 259). For Frazer, a global culture, differentiated only through the stages of savagery and civilization, was the relevant context and he worked, as Strathern writes (1987: 257), to explicate a discourse already known to his audience. But perhaps Frazer's invocation of mythology ought not simply to be regarded dismissively as a mere appeal to populist evolutionist sentiments, but may serve a more profound intellectual purpose. Indeed, his poetic mythological prose makes him less of a pseudo-scientist and more of a thoughtful relativist, since, I suppose, it implies that he was playing with ideas about how his origin stories could be virtually true - that is, true in the sense a myth is true in spite of being empirically and historically unaccept able. It also illuminates that 'civilized' man has within him the same myth-making tendencies as 'primitive' man, which is by any standards synchronic and not an evolu tionary posture. Yet these aspects are not the most important to my argument. What is important is that the literary grace of Frazer's prose suggests an alternative view on anthropology - a view in which its task is not to mimic or accurately reflect ethnographic reality but rather to overcome it. Frazer, this most literary of figures, was effectively pointing to the curious paradox inherent in any anthropological account: the more faithful it becomes to ethnographic reality, the more it loses its high function of imagery, namely that of synthesizing and interpreting what it represents. And thereby it loses interest to anthropology as a theoretical enterprise. For Frazer, therefore, ethnographic realism is not our discipline's duty. Rather, for him, anthropology begins where detailed ethnographic description leaves off. As R. Angus Downie points out, Frazer deliberately added vivid details to his ethnographic observers' bald accounts, 'making the dry leaves live' (1970: 95). To take this as a matter of pure invention a la Carlos Castaneda's (1968) apparently fictitious writing on Mexican shamanism would be to miss the point. Rather, it should be understood along the lines of Tim Ingold when he writes that 'the paradox of the armchair is that in order to know one can no longer be in the world of which one seeks knowledge' (2008: 83, emphasis in the original). Unlike Ingold, however, I do not see Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="7">510 Rane Willerslev anthropology's solution in grounding 'knowing' in 'being-in-the-world' rather than in the armchair, a point which I will return to later. The point to stress here is that it is not that Frazer simply made stuff up when the facts did not fit his account. Rather, he revealed that anthropological thinking is a creative endeavour, which should not be confused with the accurate echoing of the 'textures' of authentic social life - akin to Malinowski's situated description of'being there' (Boon 1982:14). A faithful correspon dence or fidelity between representation and actuality is not only impossible but also unwanted. Anthropology should express social reality by making it alive again - that is, by in some way distorting it through the high function of the scholar's speculative imagination and imparting that distortion with explanatory force. Thus, the 'tampering with his source material' (Strathern 1987: 256) that Frazer has been so vigorously accused of (Leach 1966: 564) was perhaps motivated by a more profound intention - to show that ethnography and anthropology, while mutually interdependent, are none the less endeavours of quite different kinds. I do not intend to propose Frazer as an early predecessor of some 'post-modern mood' the attitude of which is 'to make deliberate play with context' (Strathern 1987: 265). Biographers like Robert Ackerman (1987: 15,100) and Downie (1970: 114) along with critics like Ludwig Wittgenstein (Cioffi 1998:108) are clearly quite right in enlisting Frazer among the convinced and passionate empiricists. Indeed, it is worth quoting Frazer himself, routinely castigated for supposedly tearing cases out of context: 'The first condition of a sound induction is exactly observation. What we want, therefore, in this branch of science is, first and foremost, full, true, and precise accounts of savage and barbarous peoples based on personal observation' (Frazer 1931 [1922]: 224). So, Frazer, far from comparing phenomena out of their contexts, compared phenomena in their contexts. In fact, he was so worried that comparison prior to observation would contaminate the observation that he insisted that 'every observer ... should describe it as if no other people existed' (Frazer 1931 [1922]: 246). Thus, there is little doubt that Frazer saw his thinking as deeply dependent on reliable ethnography. Indeed The Golden Bough is famous for piling example upon example of myths, rites, and religious practices from all over the world. Even so, the important point for my argument is to recognize that Frazer interro gated ethnographic details only in order to invent suitably targeted means of escaping them by injecting into the text his own imaginative speculations as to the interconnec tions of Nemi and other religious phenomena and their possible origins. As such, Frazer's overall aim can be seen as an exercise in what in Deleuze's terminology could be deemed a kind of creative 'indiscernment' - 'an effort to subtract the source of creation from the mediation of the created' (Hallward 2006: 3). With these considerations in mind, I will take Frazer as my guide and turn towards a remote corner of the Russian empire, namely the tundra of northern Kamchatka, which is the home of the Chukchi, a Siberian indigenous group of hunters and rein deer herders (Fig. 2). My aim is to launch a speculative investigation into the origin of the animist soul. Unlike Frazer, I have actually lived among the Chukchi for a con siderable period of time, and yet I see no contradiction in this, because just like him I do not doubt the value of ethnography as a method of inquiry. My quarrel is not with the value of ethnography, but with our discipline's particularism along with its inherent recourse to empirical evidence as the ultimate criterion for anthropological knowledge. Hence, like a genuine armchair anthropologist, my investigation will not be restricted to the provincial study of a single people. Instead, I will follow Frazer's Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="8">Frazer strikes back from the armchair 511 Figure 2.

(Photo by the author.) style of comparison - what Evans-Pritchard (1965: 9) caricatured as the 'scissors-and paste method' - and make undisciplined raids on ethnographic descriptions from all parts of the world. In this way, I hope by way of my scholarly imagination to synthe size a set of ethnographic phenomena of which my Chukchi material is only one variant and from which I aim to subtract the primordial source of the animist concept of soul. The soul's many bodies The Chukchi live in a world full of vision, full of eyes. Every being - humans, animals, inanimate objects, and spirits - is said to have a viewpoint of its own that stares back. As Richard Nelson puts it with regard to the Koyukon Indians of the Alaskan boreal forest, though equally applicable to the Chukchi: '[They] live in a world that watches, in a forest of eyes. A person moving through nature ... is never truly alone. The surroundings are aware, sensate, personified' (1983:14). Among the Chukchi this conception of living in a world that watches has further ramifications, for here all beings participate in a field of social interaction defined in terms of predation. From the viewpoint of any class of beings, all others are either predators or prey. The human hunter sees the wild reindeer or seal as prey in much the same way as he himself is seen as animal prey by the spirits of these animals. Indeed, much of what goes on in the world of the Chukchi is concerned with this fearsome symmetry of being both subject and object of vision, both predator and prey. As Waldemar Bogoras, the classical ethnographer of the Chukchi, describes it with regard to the much-feared evil spirits, the ke'let (sing. ke'lE): Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="9">512 Rane Willerslev The object of their hunts is exclusively man, whom they usually call 'a little seal'. Their divining stone is a human skull, while men often use for this purpose the skull of some animal ... After catching a soul, they chop it into pieces, cook it in a kettle, and feed their children with it... [However] the ke'let are not exempt from the attacks of shamans ... The ke'let, on their part, call shamans ke'let (1904-9: 294-5) Horrifying as this predatory world may seem, it fits neatly into what Eduardo Viveiros de Castro denotes Amerindian 'perspectivism'. It is an ontology 'according to which the world is inhabited by different sorts of subjects or persons, human or non-human, which apprehend reality from distinct points of view' (Viveiros de Castro 1998: 469). Yet these are not alternative points of view of the same world, but rather result from a carrying-over of the same point of view into alternative realities. Thus, the ke'let see the world in similar or identical ways to human beings and behave just like them from their own subjective perspective (Fig. 3). This, according to Viveiros de Castro, is because both humans and non-humans possess the same kind of inten tional substance or 'soul', and, as he writes, 'the ability to adopt a point of view is undoubtedly a power of the soul ... [and] since the soul is formally identical in all species, it can only see the same things everywhere' (1998: 478). Figure 3.

Accord ingly, while the ke'let go hunting for prey in the same way as the Chukchi go hunting for prey, what each class of beings sees as prey differs and depends on their distinctive kinds of bodies. Now this idea that 'humanity' is extendable to various types of beings (Descola 1986: 120), so characteristic of perspectivism, along with the symmetrical inversion of preda tor and prey (Fausto 2007), is by no means confined to indigenous Amazonia, but is recorded world-wide among a great number of so-called 'animist' societies. In northern Siberia, not only the Chukchi but also the Koryak (Jochelson 1908:149), the Yukaghir, and the Eveny (Jochelson 1926; Willerslev 2007: 86-110) give equal empha sis to the theme of animals and spirits seeing themselves as humans see themselves. The same is true of North American native peoples, such as the Ojibwa (Hallowell i960), the Cree (Brightman 1993: 47; Burnham 1992; Tanner 1979: 136), the Kwakiutl and Heida (Chaussonnet 1988; Goldman 1975; Fig. 4), and the Inuit (Fienup-Riordan 1994; Ingold 2000:111-31; Rasmussen 1929). Among indigenous groups of Southeast Asia also, such as the Chewong of Malaysia (Howell 1989) and the Huaulu of eastern Indonesia (Valeri 2000: 305), we find what is essentially a perspectival cosmology. As Signe Howell writes about the bas, the evil spirits of the Chewong: 'The fact that has have different eyes means that they perceive reality differently. They cause disease to humans ... however, the bas do not see human beings as such, they only see meat' (1989:104). In Africa, perspectivism is less clearly documented, but it may be detected at least in fragments among the foraging Haddad of West Africa (Nicolaisen 2010: 272) and the Figure 4. Haida transformation mask. Behind the raven face (upper mask) hides a human face. (Drawing by Sara Heil jensen, Moesgaard Museum.)

During trance dancing, the latter are said to transform into lions, leopards, or snakes, whereby the dancer comes to see these predators as fellow humans, while his human kin become prey (Guenther 1999:187). In Central Asia and Mongolia, we also find perspectivism but with a twist in that it is 'primarily concerned with inter-human metamorphosis ... in seeking to take on the perspective of past humans (ancestors)' (Pedersen 2001:424; see also Pedersen, Empson &amp; Humphrey 2007:144). Be that as it may, it is quite likely that animism and perspectivism are very closely connected phenomena (Viveiros de Castro 1998: 472-4), or, as Pedersen (2001: 421) states, perspectivism is the strongest form of the general animist belief in human-non human sociality. Its elementary premise appears to rest on a pertinent division between an 'inner spiritual soul' and, concealing this, an 'outward material appearance'. Whereas the former is anthropomorphic and independent of its variable outward form, the latter is likened to somatic 'clothing', which may be exchanged so that one takes up the viewpoint of another being (Viveiros de Castro 1998: 471). Indeed, when reading through the various ethnographic studies listed above, we find numerous examples of shamans, hunters, and warriors covering themselves in outfits resembling an animal's or ancestor's outward form so as to take on their corporal powers and perspectives. Hence, at first view, Viveiros de Castro's (2001: 33) assumption that the animist concept of soul is a 'given' dimension of the body, in the sense that it is identical for all beings and not the product of transformation (or at least not in the way the body is), appears to be supported by much ethnographic evidence. Yet, when confronting eth nographic details of the body-soul interface among various indigenous groups, ambi guities crop up, which obscure or at least complicate the logical consistency of his theory. Above all, one cannot fail to take notice of the widespread tendency to conceive the soul as something quasi-physical (Fig. 5). Indeed, when taking a hasty glance through Figure 5.

A similar observation is made by Ake Hultkrantz in his massive compendium of North American soul conceptions: 'The soul is ... vested with a not inconsiderable measure of coarse materiality' (1953: 391). Emile Durkheim makes the same point even more directly: 'It would be a misunder standing to conceive the body as a kind of lodging in which the soul resides ... Quite the contrary, it is bound to the body with the closest of ties' (1995 [1912]: 254); 'The soul is always conceived of in physical forms' (1995 [1912]: 225). The Chukchi are a case in point. Their term uvi'rit, which is usually translated as 'soul' in Russian anthropology (Gorbacheva 1985:12-17), belongs to the linguistic root uvi'k, meaning literally'body' (Bogoras 1904-9:332). In fact, there is an important sense in which Chukchi souls are a form of bodies. This is best illustrated by describing the workings of a small wooden amulet in the shape of a human figure. The amulet is called ka'mak-lu'u, meaning 'wooden face', and is fastened in the armpit of a person's outer clothing or to his belt (Willerslev 2009: 697; Fig. 6). It is said to provide its owner with the body of a ke'lE, who will therefore see him as a fellow human being as opposed to animal prey and leave him alone. The principal idea is that the person attaching the amulet to his body turns himself'inside out', so to speak, in that his own body becomes Figure 6.

Hence, what compromises the inner soul and the outer body is a matter of perspective: from the viewpoint of the ka'mak-lu'u, the person's body is the soul, whereas, from the human viewpoint, the ka'mak-lu'u is the soul (Willerslev 2009: 697). Body and soul are, so to speak, reversibles (Corsin-Jimenez &amp; Willerslev 2007: 538). This leaves us with the problem of accounting for the coexistence of two seemingly contradictory sets of animist beliefs about the nature of the soul. On the one hand, the soul is seen as a common spiritual essence distinct from the body, which is conceived of as a form of clothing and through which alterity is apprehended as such. On the other hand, no clear division exists between body and soul or appearance and essence, and each pair can be mutually reversed. Can these two apparently opposed conceptions of the soul be understood in a coherent way? Aparedica Vila^a's study of how the soul is connected to the body among the Wari' of lowland Amazonia constitutes an apt entry point. Among the Wari', she writes, the reality of soul 'lies in the eyes of others' (2005: 449), which is therefore 'constituted within relations' (2005: 456). A given person's soul, human or non-human, is visible to other persons, but in the form of a body. However, if those others perceiving the soul belong to another kind of people, such as animals or spirits, they will see it as radically different from the way in which the human subject sees his or her own body (Vilaija 2005: 455). Thus, the soul represents the capacity of the person to adopt a multiplicity of bodily forms as seen from the external perspective of others. However, Vila^a is at some pains to point out that in Amazonian perspectivism, the different perspectives never add up to a whole; thus 'any totalization of the body is impossible' (2005: 458). I will return to this latter point. For now I will point out that it follows quite logically from Vilaca's account that 'duplicity is the law of every being and every event' (Lima 1999: 121). To a Chukchi person his soul is in fact identical with his human body or rather it is his body, whereas it is the body of a reindeer or a seal in the eyes of a ke'lE. The soul becomes in this way the person's 'double body', which makes sense when we consider that world-wide the most common indigenous word for soul is 'shadow' (see, e.g., Hultkrantz 1953: 302-8; Rival 2005; Speck 1963: 33; Vilacpa 2005: 454; Willerslev 2007: 69), which implies that the soul is actualized as a body in another world. This interpretation is actually in accord with Tylor (1958 [1871], vol. 1: 428), who proposed that animist ideas about the soul originated from man's experiences of his body's 'double' in death, disease, trances, and, above all, dreams, where his phantom (body) was seen as engaging in action while the dreamer slept. May we then conclude with Vila^a (2005: 455) that the animist soul is in fact the body, whose actualization as a specific kind of body depends on the eyes of the person who is looking? I believe we still face a problem, which begins with the acute question of 'trans lation between cultures'. So far, I have uncritically followed the tradition of Tylor, Frazer, and Viveiros de Castro, among many others, and used the English word 'soul' to represent indigenous concepts. However, this word is quite clearly misleading. The soul in our Judaeo-Christian discourse is part and parcel of an ontological oppo sition of spirit and matter, which implies that the soul is immaterial. Its substance is spiritus, 'breath' - 'what is most invisible in the visible, most immaterial in the material' (Valeri 2000: 24). However, according to animist perspectival thinking, as Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17,504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="14">Frazer strikes back from the armchair 517 we have just seen, the soul is nothing of the sort. Quite the contrary, in fact: it is a body! Even beings that are said to hunt for souls, such as ke'let among the Chukchi (Bogoras 1904-9: 294-5), the bas among the Chewong (Howell 1989: 104), and the abasylar among the Yukaghirs (Willerslev 2007: 82), never actually see souls. They see 'meat': reindeer, seal, and elk - so, what they see is, as a matter of ethnographic fact, bodies. Does this then mean that the soul as something essentially invisible, ethereal, and ghostlike does not exist in animist perspectival thinking? I venture that it does. In fact, I will set out to show that among various indigenous societies we find ideas about a soul which operates on a purely spiritual plane, thus escaping the embodied infra-human perspective of any actual being. Indeed, it is from this realm of virtuality that I will seek to subtract the very source or origin of the animist soul. The animist high gods Let me briefly return to the great armchair scholars. Tylor (1958 [1871], esp. vol. 2) believed that the origin of religion developed out of simple thoughts about the exist ence of souls, which then at a much later stage of culture turned into a belief in God. Frazer (1959 [1911]) proposed a similar developmental scheme, arranging magic, reli gion, and science in an evolutionary linear sequence. However, both schemes were radically challenged by a contemporary scholar who is now largely lost to historical view. His name was Andrew Lang (2010 [1898]), a folklorist and writer, who stressed that a theistic concept of a 'high god' was evident among the most primitive of peoples - for example, orenda among the Iroquois and mana among the Maori. Even among the Australian Aborigines, whom Frazer had deemed the 'rudest savages' with no religion, only magic, a high god - the so-called 'All Father' - had been detected (Howitt 1884). Lang thus concluded that 'certain low savages are as monotheistic as some Christians' and that 'supreme gods [were] not necessarily developed out of "spirits" ' (quoted in Stocking 1995:174). It is worth mentioning that, at about the same time, similar beliefs in a so-called 'Supreme Being' were being reported among Siberia's supposedly most archaic peoples, the Chukchi and the Yukaghir, by the two legendary ethnographers Jochelson and Bogoras. The Yukaghir named it Pon (lochelson 1926:140, 235), meaning 'Something', whereas the Chukchi (Bogoras 1904-9: 314) called it Vairgin, which means 'Something Existing'. Now, Tylor (1891) fiercely responded that the high gods and supreme beings were not archaic pre-contact deities, but the result of direct or indirect influence from mission ary activities - a view which has been revitalized by Jonathan Z. Smith (1982). However, I believe that the now rejected ideas about high gods among animist peoples are in need of further comments. First, it is noticeable that with regard to Siberia, which I know the best, ideas about a Supreme Being are shared among all of the so-called Palaeo-Siberians: the Yukaghir, Chukchi, Koryak, Itelmen, and the Aleut (Jochelson 1926). In addition, we may cer tainly say that Yukaghir do not regard Pon as equivalent to the Christian God, and this is clearly shown in their distinction between Pon and Qoil. The latter used to be the name of the dead clan shaman's skull (Jochelson 1926: 65), but is now the name of the Christian God. Finally, while it can be said that Christianity has had an impact on virtually all Siberian peoples, the Chukchi are an exception. During the eighteenth Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="15">518 Rane Willerslev century, when the Russian Orthodox Mission was most active, the Chukchi were at constant war with Russia (Bogoras 1904-9:729-30) - a war which they in fact won, with the result that their lands where fully annexed by the Russian empire only after the 1917 Revolution, when all missionary activity had been banned. Many Chukchi, therefore, have been totally out of the reach of Christian missionaries and are not even formally baptized (Willerslev 2009: 694). This, however, is not to say that I accept Lang's theory of archaic high gods as parallel to the Christian God. From the information at my disposal, it is quite clear that both Pon and Va'irgin do not count as gods, but are rather like the Creative Spirit of the Nuer, whom Evans-Pritchard (1956:4-7) described as beyond contact and comprehension yet the giver and sustainer of all life. Thus, Jochelson writes about Pon that 'he is of a most vague and infinite character' (1926:140). 'The Yukaghir do not address him with prayers and do not present offerings to him ... [and their] mythology contains no reference ... to the Pon' (1926: 235). As regards the Chukchi conceptions of Va'irgin, Bogoras (1904-9: 314) is even more indefinite. He is unclear if the name refers to an individual deity or is rather an appellative term for the entire class of spirits. However, Va'irgin 'does not belong to those sacrificed to' (Bogoras 1904-9: 314) and 'plays no active part in mythology' (Jochelson 1908: 26). This notion of supreme beings as elusive and indefinable, having no personal or concrete features or any cult attached to them, was fully confirmed during my own spells of fieldwork. In fact both Pon and Va'irgin are almost completely unknown to the majority of present-day Yukaghir and Chukchi. Whenever asked, they would shrug their shoulders in dismissal and say 'who knows' or 'never heard of it'. Only one Chukchi elder, who was a type of shaman, came up with a somewhat more elaborate answer: 'You look around and everything you see, the reindeer, the snow, the sky and the sun are all Va'irgin. His eyes rest on everything and he sees through everything that exists. This is why we simply call him Va'irgin [meaning 'Something Existing']'. We pick up, here, the thread of the question I raised about the insufficiencies of the type of knowledge derived from prolonged fieldwork alone. Ethnographically speak ing, Pon and Va'irgin hardly exist: there are no sacrifices or prayers directed towards them, and no myths explaining their whereabouts and deeds; the people themselves hardly know of them. In fact, they exist outside just about the entire ethnographic domain of observation and discourse. And yet I believe them to be of paramount importance to the issue that interests us here, namely the animist concept of soul and its origin. To argue this, however, we need to move outside the zone of 'being-in the-world' of fieldwork (Ingold 2008: 82) and into the 'being-in-the-armchair' of speculation, so as to render plausible by 'thought experiment' why ideas about a Supreme Being are and must be integral to the animist concept of soul. If we are successful in this endeavour, it sends a message with critical implications for anthro pology, because it implies that we should not be content resting on our ethnographic laurels, but also allow space for the armchair from which the scholar can let his or her imagination spin freely. The view from everywhere I will begin this task by turning to the philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose theory of perception proposes a radical break with our intuitive, common-sense understanding of vision as located where our eyes are: Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="16">Frazer strikes back from the armchair 519 When I look at the lamp on my table, I attribute to it not only the qualities visible from where I am, but also those which the chimney, the walls, the table can 'see'; the back of my lamp is nothing other than the face which it 'shows' to the chimney (Merleau-Ponty 2002 [1945]: 79). Let me explain this somewhat cryptic passage, which pushes vision into the animist realm where every object grows eyes and stares back. Given that our perception of an object always takes place from one perspectival point of view or another, we can never see the object in its totality but only partly. There will always be a hidden side, which remains absent from our direct view. Nevertheless, we immediately presume that there is more to the object than what is exhibited to our naked eye. If this were not so, we would experience the object as a two-dimensional facade and not as a fully fledged three-dimensional reality. Merleau-Ponty explains this by arguing that it is because our own perspective is entangled in a vast sprawling web of viewpoints, which surrounds the focal thing and provides the supporting context for that side of the object which is in view at any one time, that we experience it to be deep or solid rather than just flat. In other words, we do not simply see by our own power or force, but are dependent on an anonymous or general vision, which is already in place, waiting to assign us a place within it. Merleau-Ponty calls it the 'view from everywhere', whereas Martin Holbraad and I (Holbraad &amp; Willerslev 2007) have called it the 'transcendental perspective'. This latter term does not imply a leap into an otherworldly 'beyond'. Not at all: the view from everywhere is embedded in matter - in things, objects and bodies - and, as such, it does not exist in some higher plane. 'Transcendental' here simply implies that this all-inclusive perspective is impossible to adopt (Holbraad &amp; Willerslev 2007: 334). Even so, the view from everywhere is a viewpoint that we cannot do without. It underlies every perspective as the invisible background that allows things to stand out in their visibility. As Merleau-Ponty expresses it: '[T]he proper essence of the visible is to have a lining of invisibility ... which it makes present by a certain absence' (2000 [1964]: 187). In other words, while the view from everywhere implies the world seen in totally clear and unambiguous visibility - that is, the world as laid bare in absolute transparency - it is a view that must hide itself in order for the visible world to appear before our eyes. The unlimited One-All Now, this anonymous primordial totality of vision, which is situated here, there, and everywhere all at once, is analogous to what Deleuze (1988: 111) calls the virtual, understood as the primordial visual force that exists beyond the organic limitations of actual seeing beings and which is most adequately expressed in pure imagination. However, I also venture to suggest that it finds its creative equivalent in the Yukaghir and Chukchi notions of Pon and Va'irgin and in the so-called 'supreme beings' of other animist societies. These essentially elusive and impalpable creative forces represent a pre-perspectival vision, which underlies any bodily perspective as its vital or animating principle. Indeed, this explains why Pon and Va'irgin go under such unidentified names as 'Something' and 'Something Existing', because they are nothing but the unlimited 'One-All' (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1994: 35, 38): the virtual primordial totality that sees without limits and distances in a single movement of spirit. Likewise, it comes as no surprise that no myth refers to them and no offerings or prayers are made in their Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17,504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="17">520 Rane Willerslev honour, because this would entail reducing them to some kind of corporal creature with specific and therefore limited visual capacities. But if Port and Va'irgin are the pure viewpoint that intuits the whole of reality, then what do they in fact see? In the terminology of perspectival theory, they can only be seeing the full spiritualization or dematerialization of life, which is the soul of things. The Supreme Being thus defines or makes visible the soul, which is the body seen in its totality or absolute visibility, leaving nothing hidden - that is, the body seen from all sides, in all relationships all at once (Holbraad &amp; Willerslev 2007: 335). The soul, in other words, is nothing but the body grasped in a single totalizing view. Vila^a, there fore, is quite right ethnographically when she holds that within a perspectival cosmol ogy 'any totalization of the body is impossible' (2005: 458). However, anthropologically she is not right enough: it is the anonymous primordial totality of vision, ascribed to supreme beings like Port and Va'irgin, which allows for a perspectival concept of soul to arise in the first place. This is the germ of truth in Lang's (2010 [1898]) now rejected doctrine of high gods in 'primitive' societies, for without the awareness of some kind of an all-seeing being, even if only vaguely recognized, there could be no concept of soul as such. The real starting-point or origin of the animist soul is, therefore, the virtual primordial totality of vision, which is in fact a 'phantom ideal' (Derrida 1995: 244) and not an actual thing to be seen - the reason why no creature within the perspectival cosmologies ever sees souls. The Dancing Sorcerer What concrete evidence in conventional ethnographic terms can be mustered in support for my claim of the animist perspectival dependence on a Supreme Being? Not much, I am afraid. As already stated, the virtual by its nature cannot be practically given, presented, or represented (Hallward 2006: 21). Insight into the virtual, therefore, is never a matter of empirical verification. Does this imply a turn away from evidence towards something more akin to religious belief? Not quite. Webb Keane (2008: S124) has challenged the above contrast by given a detailed explanation of how the materiality of religious phenomena can stand as evidence of something as seemingly immaterial as belief. Echoing Keane's proposition, I will go on to show how my speculative stance on the animist soul may in fact be supported by graphic evidence. Consider the Palae olithic artwork in the caves of the French Pyrenees, which is as old as the dawn of humanity itself, approximately 20,000 BC. It is primarily prey which is depicted: reindeer, horse, bison, and mammoth. The animals are naturalistically rendered with detailed depictions of eyes, horns, and tails, but they are also steno-typical with their powerful posture and overloaded bodies. The animals are likely to have been intended as game for several are delineated with arrows and there are also traces of blows (Fig. 7). Hardly any depictions of human beings exist. However, in the Sanc tuary cave of Les Trois-Freres, we find an enigmatic figure, nicknamed the 'Dancing Sorcerer' (Fig. 8). It shows a hybrid creature, undoubtedly male, who stands sideways as if he is about to jump while gazing straight at the viewer. Every part of his anatomy belongs to some animal: an antlered head, a wolf s ears, eyes of an owl, a cat's face, the long beard of a reindeer, paws of a bear, and the tail of a wild horse. His overall shape, however, is profoundly human. He is placed in the cave ceiling with the animals stretching in all directions around him. Not surprisingly, archaeologists Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17,504-526 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="18">Frazer strikes back from the armchair 521 ft Figure 7. Several of the animal depictions in the Sanctuary cave of Les Trois-Freres are delineated with arrows and there are also traces of blows from stone tools. (Drawing by )ens Kirkeby, Moesgaard Museum, based on Clottes &amp; Lewis-Williams 1997: 68, Fig. 62.) have seen him as the very key for opening the secret meaning of the caves. Henri Breuil (1958) saw him as a shaman in ceremonial dress, or in the moment of shape shifting. Others have suggested the figure to be the spirit master of the animals, who embodies the essence of all the animal species (Gimbutas 1989: 174-5; Vitebsky 1995: 29). A more imaginative interpretation suggests the figure to be a self-portrait of the artist, who under a narcotic trance painted not only animals but also himself (Lewis Williams 2002). Let me add another interpretation to the list. We have seen that the other creatures depicted are prey as seen from the viewpoint of human hunters. That is, they are represented as actual animal bodies, generously laden with meat, and they have indeed been shot at. Why should it be any different with the Dancing Sorcerer? Also he is likely to signify prey or rather the general idea of prey. This is a person, human or non-human, seen from all predatory viewpoints at once. This would explain why he is surrounded by a collage of animals, supplying the numerous perspectives on him. It also explains why his body is a mosaic of animal body parts, since each external perspective perceives him as one kind of prey or another. In addition, it explains why he is about to jump, for who would not try to flee the circle of preda tory gazes? Last but not least, it explains why we can detect underneath the figure's composite body a slight lining - an airy or ghostlike substance - which I imagine to be the Palaeolithic hunters' attempt at exposing the spiritual soul, which is beyond depiction, but which they sought to make 'present by a certain absence'. The Dancing Sorcerer, then, is the essence of the idea of soul as prey, seen through the divine eyes of the unlimited One-All.

The 'Dancing Sorcerer' of Les Trois-Freres. (Drawing by Jens Kirkeby, Moesgaard Museum, based on Ciottes &amp; Lewis-Williams 1997: 69, Fig. 64.) Conclusion By way of conclusion, one could ask if the theory just presented is in any way more plausible than, let's say, Tylor's old theory of the origin of the soul. Both explanations are largely inaccessible to verification and as such both qualify as belonging to the 'if-I-were-a-horse' variety. Sure enough, dreams, trances, and visions offer one specu lative explanation for the origin of the animist soul, the virtual primordial totality of vision another. The key point for both explanations is that they are imaginary accounts, since it is impossible to study human origins without first moving into mythical discourse - 'which is that discourse which makes the presence of the non-empirical reality' (Stringer 1999: 549). Frazer understood this, which is why he used fine mythical prose to speculate about the origins of religiosity. Perhaps, he also knew that all we can ask of an origin story is that it makes 'good horse sense' (Lewis 1986: 15) - that it has its own imaginative power, as does any myth worth reciting.

Frazer revient du fond de son fauteuil: une nouvelle recherche de I'ame animiste Resume La question qui sert de fil rouge a ce propos peut £tre formulee crument: est-ce une erreur que de transposer notre interet pour un phenomene ethnographique vers une investigation empirique, alors que pour le mettre en lumifere, il necessiterait en reality une contemplation imaginative? L'auteur affirme, de manifere generate, que le recours aux preuves ethnographiques selon les principes de Malinovski n'est pas pertinent. II propose comme exemple la conception animiste de « Fame » et montre pourquoi il s'agit pour l'essentiel d'une question imaginaire: pour rendre cette question intelligible, il faut done s'engager dans une investigation speculative de ses origines. Cette approche fait £cho a Frazer, dernier avatar de l'ancienne armchair anthropology. Son style anthropologique se caracterise par un questionnement deliberement speculatif des divers comptes-rendus ethnographiques: un processus par le biais duquel la pensee abstraite apporte force et signification aux observations ethnographiques.
