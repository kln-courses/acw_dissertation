<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ETHICAL BASIS FOR EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES PAUL B. DIEDERICH IT IS SO uncommon for a teacher to have clearly in mind any purpose at all for his teaching that, when he announces a set of "objectives," we are inclined to accept it without cavil. If we think about it at all, we tend to believe that in a democracy a teacher may direct his teaching toward any purposes he likes, provided they are not subversive of democracy, or immoral, or obviously unbecoming a scholar and a gentleman. Such a belief works better in practice than in theory, for we may rely on the vast, unco-ordinated good sense of the profession to correct the really harmful ex- cesses. As theory, however, it is not satis- fying to the mind. If carried to its logical conclusion, it would permit a group of teachers to teach nothing but tap-dancing and bricklaying as their program for the degree of Bachelor of Arts.We see at once that teachers are not free to that extent, but where and how does one draw the line? What distinguishes a purpose that we would accept as valid from one that we would re- ject? On what ultimate basis can educa- tional objectives be justified? The basis which is now used in many col- leges of liberal arts is the classical view that each living thing has certain innate poten- tialities and is a good thing of its kind to the extent that these potentialities are devel- oped. Just as the acorn is capable of becom- ing an oak, if placed in a favorable environ- ment, or of becoming food for hogs, if it falls into a trough, so young men and women have capacities which must be nourished by edu- cation if they are to reach their full develop- ment. Of these capacities, the most distinc- tive and important is the use of reason. It is this unique gift which has given man his mastery of the earth. The first duty of schools, therefore, is to develop all the powers of the mind. It is argued that, once these powers are developed, they will be suf- ficient to cope with the problems of daily life without any more specialized training or knowledge than can either be acquired on the spot or be hired from an expert. If I am not mistaken, the root of this view of education lies in the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics, I097b, in which Aris- totle argues approximately as follows: We call anything good when it does well what it alone can do or what it can do better than anything else. We call a knife good if it cuts well, a cow good if it gives plenty of milk, and a flute-player good if he plays the flute well. What, then, is a good man? Obviously, one who does well what man alone can do or what man can do better than any other creature. What is that? It is using his reason. Reason is the distinctive characteristic of man. A good man, then, is one who reasons well. But what about the clever criminal; is he a good man? No, because he has not rea- soned well about his central problem: what he ought to get out of life, and how to go about it. A good man is one whose whole life is directed most completely by all the powers of the mind. No one can deny the nobility of this ideal, and a school will not go far wrong in at- tempting to develop people who can live the life of reason as conceived by Aristotle. There are, however, several possible objec- tions to this position-and not merely on the naive ground that Aristotle lived a long while ago. The particular statement in ques- tion is not affected by the passing of time. If it was true when Aristotle wrote it, then it is true now. But I cannot believe that it was ever true. I shall pass over the objection that other animals are "rational" in varying degrees; that man's reason represents only the selec- tion and development of powers common to I23</page><page sequence="2">124 ETHICS all life, aided enormously by the possession of language. Nonetheless, man's reason has developed so far beyond that of other ani- mals that it may well be regarded as a unique gift. I shall also waive the objection that Aristotle overlooked or minimized the im- portance of the emotions. It is true that Aristotle is not Freud, but there is nothing in the text to which I have referred which rules out the cultivation of any emotions of which an enlightened man would approve. The most adequate translation I can frame of his ideal is "living guided by all the powers of the mind." In a larger sense, we may easily take these powers to include normal, healthy emotions. I cannot, however, pass over a curious anthropomorphic twist in Aristotle's analo- gies. All his examples were counted good with reference to man's purposes. A good knife is one that cuts well-because we use a knife to cut with. A good cow is one that gives plenty of milk-because we keep cows for their milk. A good flute-player is one who plays the flute well-because we hire him for that purpose. I cannot believe that we ad- mire these things in a disinterested fashion when they "fulfil their natures." We want them to serve certain purposes, and we call them good when they serve those purposes well. But what use does a man make of him- self? All the other things were means and were good or bad means in relation to what we wanted them for. But what do we want ourselves for? A man does not use himself as a means-except very rarely, in heroic self- sacrifice. He may use his hands, his feet, his body, or his brain as a means, but not him- self. His reason for calling a means good does not apply to himself, for he is not a means but an end. For this reason Aristotle's analogies break down. A man is not good for the same reason that a means to one of his purposes is good. A second possible objection is that, in the portion of the text to which I have referred, Aristotle set out to discover what was good for man-what constituted his welfare and happiness-and then based his conclusion on what man was good at. His argument rests on an ambiguity in the word "good." What is good for man need not be what man is good at, and it may include many things at which man is no more adept than other animals. A match is good at making a flame, but is the flame good for the match? A third objection is that it is assumed without proof that our distinctive charac- teristic ought to be cultivated and devel- oped to an unspecified extent. The distinc- tive characteristic of a giraffe is his long neck. Should it be his chief aim in life to extend the length of his neck until in one of his descendants it became, let us say, twenty miles long? Such an endeavor would cer- tainly contradict Aristotle's other doctrine of the golden mean. In the same way, an ex- clusive concentration upon the development of reason might finally produce among us a race no longer of men but of professors. A fourth objection is that, if education should be concerned solely with the develop- ment of our unique attributes, several such attributes have been overlooked. Man has often been defined as the only tool-using animal, and the only way to develop this potentiality is through vocational educa- tion. He is the only animal without natural covering for his body. Perhaps Gypsy Rose Lee should be hired to preside over this divi- sion of the curriculum. And he is the only animal capable of copulating at any time- an activity for which modern education pro- vides many opportunities but no encourage- ment. A fifth objection is that, even if we grant that reason is a valuable trait which ought to be developed, have we no obligation to- ward the characteristics which we share with other animals? Should men pay no at- tention to eating, sleeping, working, and re- producing, merely because other animals can do these things? We have a whole or- ganism to maintain and use, not just one part of it which happens to be unique. "It is a queer view of the nature of any or- ganism," says Sidney Hook, "that limits itself to a concern only with its differentia.'</page><page sequence="3">DISCUSSION I25 A sixth objection is that a long series of careful experiments, beginning with William James, has convinced educators that one cannot teach men to reason well in general but to reason well about something that is cir- cumscribed by their knowledge and experi- ence. This conclusion has been so un- palatable to the classical view of education that we keep saying that it has been aban- doned by the educators themselves; that "transfer" is now known to occur. Of course it does, or all learning would be impossible, but not to anything like the extent that the classical view of education assumed. We can teach students certain general methods of attacking problems, and we can teach them to avoid certain common pitfalls in think- ing, but let them apply all these lessons to such a problem as what ails a balky motor, in competition with a man who knows some- thing about motors, and they are likely to come off second best. It would be fortunate if we did not have "to reason" and "to think" as intransitive verbs, but only "to reason about" or "to think about," which would require an object. Then we could not say, "We teach our students to think," but only "We teach our students to think about ," and we might be at a loss to finish the sentence. 'Finally, the ideal of living in accordance with reason is not a sufficiently definite goal for a whole program of education, composed of about 2,800 days or i6,ooo hours of teach- ing, unless further specifications are laid down. Living is to be guided by reason- to- ward what? What does the reasonable man hope to get out of the experience of living? Simply the development and use of his ca- pacity for reasoning? Nonsense; there are many other values, such as health, love, freedom, justice, beauty, a sense of achieve- ment, and the like, which can neither be identified with reasoning, nor are they at- tained solely by reasoning. Therefore, while no one will deny the central importance of the use of reason, to the extent that it can be developed, it seems to be not the, only end at which our development should aim, nor the only means of attaining other values. For these reasons I am inclined to reject the classical view of education. True, I have attacked only one paragraph in an ancient text, but it seems to me to reveal most nakedly the central assumption on which the whole classical view is built. I do not, however, subscribe to the chief opposing view, which may be called the "utilitarian" view of education. This view holds that, since people have to do certain things in order to maintain life at a tolerable level and since these things may be classi- fied under a few broad headings, such as work, civic duties, the care of a home and family, and -leisure-time pursuits, children should be taught how to carry on the most common and necessary activities under each of these headings. I know that it will be tedious if I try to refute this view in detail, but I must insist upon it. I think we reject this view out of emotional revulsion against it rather than for clear and compelling rea- sons; and, if we are ever to build a sound philosophy, we must know what these rea- sons are. First, we do not know what things people have to do in order to live well. "Activity analysis" tells us what things people are doing now, but we may be quite sure that these are not the things they ought to be doing. For example, the average American reads less than one book a year, does the bulk of his reading in newspapers and cheap magazines, and spends upward of two hours a day listening to the radio. In a study of how adults spent their time in Boston in I935, Sorokin reported an average of one- tenth of a minute per person per day in any- thing which he could classify as civic activi- ties. In that same year eighty million of us attended the movies each week. If education emphasized these activities in these propor- tions, it could hardly be considered a force for improvement. Second, even if we knew what things people had to do in order to live well, we could not teach them with any assurance how to do these things. Even the best cur- rent notions, regardless of whether we fol- low them or not, are likely to be wrong.</page><page sequence="4">I26 ETHICS The chances for error are most strikingly demonstrated by the most authoritative recommendations of a generation or two ago. The great originator of the utilitarian view of education was Herbert Spencer, and in his advice on the rearing of offspring he emphasizes the danger of letting them play outside in flimsy clothing, "their limbs red- dened by cold." He would be shocked to see the costume in which they are now allowed to play--with the highest medical approval. A generation hence the doctors may revert to Spencer's position, or all children may play naked. Few issues in life are as simple as this one. How, then, can we be sure that our current notions are sound? Third, we doubt that youth is the time to master adult activities. These activities are learned readily and well when the need is urgent but awkwardly and imperfectly when the need is remote. Furthermore, it is pos- sible that young people must work through activities appropriate to each stage of de- velopment before they are ready for adult activities. There may well be a time at which playing Indian is more educative- more conducive to growth-than learning how to pin diapers on a baby. By the same hypothesis, football may be an appropriate game for adolescence even though it is- not played in adult life. Fourth, adult activities change so rap- idly that it is difficult to anticipate what they will be a generation hence. Our fathers were taught how to curry horses and found themselves tinkering with automobiles. We taught pacifism to a whole generation of young people who then had to fight a war. It is difficult to foresee now what activities, if any, an atomic age will require. Fifth, out of the welter of adult activities some selection is necessary. This selection is usually based on frequency of occurrence. Once this criterion is explicity recognized, it is obviously unsatisfactory. Swearing occurs more frequently than getting married, but it should hardly be given educational preference for that reason. One comes back ultimately to a judgment that some activi- ties are more important than others. Why are they important? Important for what; Not just because people now engage in them but for some other reason which "activity analysis" does not explain. If we could find that reason, we should have a different basis for the derivation of educational objectives. We might go on to examine several other bases for a philosophy of education, such as the contention that, since our people are committed to the democratic way of life, everything we teach ought to conduce in some way to the preservation and extension of that way of life; or the view held by Rousseau and the left wing of the Progres- sive Education Association that man is naturally good and the chief duty of educa- tion is to remove obstacles from the natural course of his development; or the view that, since Freud and Marx have the chief an- swers to "the troubles of our proud and an- gry dust," we should base our system of education squarely upon their theories. What has been said, however, may be enough to indicate the nature of our prob- lem and the care which must be exercised in thinking about it. The chief conclusion I should like to emphasize at this point is that we are not at liberty to announce any aims or objectives we please, merely because they seem good to us at the time. We ought to have some reasoned basis from which aims may be derived in a systematic and compre- hensive manner. I have been concerned with the problem of educational objectives for many years, and, after trying every other basis which has ever been proposed, I have concluded that the answer must be sought in an ethical theory: a carefully examined set of beliefs about what are the essential elements of a good life and what kinds of behavior are most likely to attain them. To me it is one of the self-evident propositions that valid aims for education must rest upon a careful con- sideration of what things in life are worth striving for. For schooling, as opposed to education in the broad sense, we may im- pose some further restriction if it becomes clear that certain educational needs are best served by other agencies than the school, but</page><page sequence="5">DISCUSSION I27 we must start from some conception of the good life and of the kinds of behavior which are most likely to attain it. One looks, then, for an ethical theory which will stand critical examination and one finds, naturally enough, as much dis- agreement as between conflicting views of education. Almost every ethical theory which has ever been proposed has been prefaced by the well-warranted assertion that all previous ethical theories have been nothing but a tangle of absurdities and contradic- tions. In the face of this continuous failure of the human intellect to contrive an ethical theory that will withstand criticism, it would be not only presumptuous but foolish for a simple educator to propose a new one. I note, however, that the ethical philoso- phers are all wrangling over first principles; they want to find some one ultimate test of what is good. I believe that educators can and must by-pass this controversy, for it will obviously never be settled, and mean- while we have generations of young people to educate and must have some practical, working notion of what is good for them. Since we cannot agree on first principles, I wonder if what we need, as educators, may not be found in some shrewdly conceived secondary principles: namely, in a set of values which will be accepted as good by every school of ethical thought? Let us try it. I hold that the following are essential ele- ments of a good life: i. Life itself: sheer physical survival on almost any terms but preferably on a level at which the organism functions efficiently and comfortably. This value includes (a) the neces- sities-food, clothing, shelter, etc., (b) mental and physical health, and (c) protection- police, armies, United Nations, etc. 2. Right relations with others: relations of mutual respect, affection, courtesy, tolerance, responsibility, co-operation, fair competition, honesty, justice, freedom, and the like. Note that these relations have both personal and civic aspects; for example; I value freedom in my family and among my friends, and I value a somewhat larger kind of freedom as a citizen. 3. A sense of achievement: a feeling of having accomplished something of importance, or of having lived up to one's picture of one's self, both from day to day and in the course of a lifetime. 4. Aesthetic experience: a sensitive response to beauty in many forms, from contact with nature, through all the arts, to delight in ideas. 5. Meaning: a philosophy, religion, or inte- grated view of life which makes sense of daily experience and provides orientation, direction, and security. I believe it comprises three main elements: (a) knowledge of every kind, both theoretic and practical; (b) a discipline of thinking; and (c) a system of values, such as this one. I do not know anything of ultimate value which cannot be classified under one or more of these headings. I treat "innocent pleas- ure" or "fun" as a symptom or emotional accompaniment of the attainment of a wide range of values. Sports would then lie under the first value and most conversation under the second. If the fun is not connected with the attainment of any of these values, I should be rather suspicious of it; at least, I should not regard it as of any great impor- tance in education. A complex act such as procreation has obvious bearings on several values: it ministers to the preservation of life and health (value i); it affords the possibil- ity of achieving a completely satisfying rela- tionship with another person (value 2); and it can be an aesthetic experience (value 4). I believe that these five values include in one way or another everything which can reasonably be asserted to be good for man. Attaining them in reasonable measure con- stitutes happiness, or the good life. Serious deprivation of any one of them makes the good life impossible to that extent. Their balanced attainment enables a man to reach his highest development, and that develop- ment, in turn, enables him to reach these goals ever more completely. Progress toward these goals, in fact, is what we mean by "development"-a term which is both one- sided and vaguely defined in the classical view of education. Good conduct is that which increases the chances of attaining these values, both individually and collec- tively. Bad conduct is that which decreases</page><page sequence="6">I28 ETHICS the chances of attaining them. I am aware that traditional morality is concerned chief- ly with my value 2, right relations with others, but I am deliberately extending the conception of moral conduct to include be- havior which conduces to the attainment of any of these values. The discerning reader will recognize in this list the three values which are tradi- tionally regarded as supreme and two addi- tional values. "Goodness" appears chiefly as "right relations with others"; it is also a component of "a sense of achievement" in its second definition-"living up to one's pic- ture of one's self"; and, as I have just stated, I prefer to regard "goodness" as behavior consistent with the attainment of any of my five values. I prefer not to use the old term "goodness," because my classification of values is an attempt to discover and to state what is good, and it comes as something of a shock to say "Goodness is good" or "It is good to be good." I know that there is bound to be some circularity in all ethical reason- ing, but it need not be quite so blatant. I have even paid tongue-in-cheek homage to the traditional circularity in "goodness" in my own label, "right relations with others," but I do not regard this as serious because I go on immediately to define the term in its extension. For reasons which I have already given, I leave the intension of the term to the ethical philosophers. The other two supreme values in the traditional classification, "beauty" and "truth," are retained without substantial alteration as "aesthetic experience" and "meaning." Then come two additional val- ues which may be disputed. Some of my critics hold that "life" itself is not a value; it is only a necessary condition for the at- tainment of all other values. I believe that these critics are mistaken; and in any case, it is very handy to have some central con- cept to which to relate the manifold life- maintaining activities to which we obviously do attach value, and to which I can see no theoretical objection. On a blustery cold day, for example, I value having a roof over my head. I refuse to classify this sentiment under "aesthetic experience," because my roof is not a pretty one, and my experience would have more of the aesthetic quality if I stood like Lear exposed to the elements. I also value having something to eat, and not merely because it tastes good (that I classify under "aesthetic experience") but also be- cause my body requires it. I also prefer not having a toothache to having a toothache, and not having a neurosis to having one, and I cannot view with any equanimity the prospect of being blown up by an atomic bomb. We need some central value to which we can relate all of these sentiments, and the most general one I can contrive is the main- tenance of life. I may add, as a footnote, that for some years I called this value "health," but it never suggested the right things to my students. I was thinking chiefly of food, clothing, shelter, police, and the United Na- tions, while they were thinking of vitamin pills and bending exercises. The other new value in my list is "a sense of achievement" with a twofold definition which may indicate some remaining con- fusion on my part in regard to it: "a sense of having accomplished something of impor- tance, or of having lived up to one's picture of one's self." I added this value because I get a great deal of satisfaction out of my work, and so do most of the men whom I respect. It is hard to classify this satisfaction under other values. Since I am a professor, my work might be regarded as being di- rected toward the discovery and propaga- tion of truth, and hence the satisfaction at- taching to it should be classified under that value. I am not unacquainted with the satis- faction of discovering and communicating "truth"-or, at any rate, meaningful ideas -but I must confess that this particular satisfaction is relatively rare in my work and is not at all the same thing as the normal satisfaction of getting a useful and necessary job done reasonably well. In this latter satis- faction I find more in common with the ex- perience of my father, who was a wholesale grocer, than with my own experience in those rare moments in which I have discov- ered something. It is clear, also, that this</page><page sequence="7">DISCUSSION I29 satisfaction is to be distinguished from the satisfaction of being paid, and hence from those values which I have classified under the maintenance of life. Those who work only for the pay check do not experience the "sense of achievement" to which I have ref- erence. Since work occupies so large a place in the lives of all of us, it would be unfor- tunate if the value properly associated with it were not recognized. This recognition is all the more necessary because its place has been usurped in our time by a perversion of this value which has been called "the bitch-goddess of success." Far too many of our people want to "get to the top," over the prostrate bodies of those who stand in their way, simply for the sake of getting to the top. Obviously this is a self- defeating ideal, for only one man can be at the top in any given line, and the ambitious young man "on the make" is obviously a nuisance and a peril to all the rest of us. I am glad to observe that in the present genera- tion of college students such young men are easily detected and are given a sly kick in the pants whenever the opportunity pre- sents itself. I hope that the Horatio Alger ideal of "success" is passing, but if the false gods are to leave the minds of our students, the true gods must appear. In connection with work, the true ideal seems to me to be a sense of achievement. I have set forth at some length in the Elementary School Journal for April, I945, eleven criteria by which my five major val- ues may be justified. To summarize: they are valuable as ends in themselves apart from anything else which they may help one to achieve; they are consistent with a ten- able view of the nature of man, and with a tenable view of the nature of the physical and social environment; they are consistent with one another; they are attainable; they are capable of indefinite expansion in level of attainment; they are innocent, in that attainment by one person does not involve the deprivation of another; they are neces- sary, in that deprivation of any one of them involves suffering and degeneration; they are universal-valid for all men, every- where, at all times; they are few enough to be easily remembered, but detailed enough to suggest courses of action; and, until any- one proves the contrary, they are exhaus- tive, at least as a common core of values which can be accepted by every school of ethical thought. In addition to these criteria, the five val- ues are justified by the fact that they are based upon the same intellectual processes upon which the most certain of our conclu- sions depend: namely, observation, compari- son, analysis, judgment, and classification. Life itself affords a huge laboratory. We see a man writhing and howling with pain; we see him later in good health; and we must distrust the evidence of all sense and judg- ment not to take the second state as better than the first. Similarly, we see a man hav- ing trouble with his wife, while a second is happily married, and we have to conclude, by every sort of consequence, that the sec- ond is better off than the first in this respect. We saw what happened to the unemployed during the depression, when every possibil- ity of a sense of achievement was denied them, and we had to conclude that, on the average, the results were not good. I am not trying to prove that the scientist in his laboratory comes to exactly this sort of con- clusion (although I suspect the line would be hard to draw in some cases); but I do con- tend that the kind of thinking on which a sound value judgment is based is exactly the same as that on which a sound scientific judgment is based. I do not see why we should have any less confidence in conclu- sions drawn on the basis of a careful analysis and comparison of the data which life af- fords than in conclusions drawn on the basis of exactly similar operations in a laboratory. Please understand that I do not contend that all our casual ethical judgments are of this order. Most of them are probably dic- tated by irrational forces far below the level of consciousness. But I believe the ethical philosopher, classifying just those major values which seem most essential to human life, can work out a list in which we can have as much confidence as in most of the conclu-</page><page sequence="8">I30 ETHICS sions of scientific research. Does anyone seriously doubt that the five things I have mentioned are good for people? Anyone, of course, can think of exceptional cases, but what we want here is a basis for the broad strategy of education-something which holds good in the mass and on the average. Our stake in this matter is similar to that of the physician. When he sees a man howling with pain, he does not stop to ask whether this may not be the noblest state which man can attain; he proceeds upon the fairly safe assumption that health is better than sick- ness. Similarly, the educator will not go far wrong in assuming that life is preferable to death, love to hate, achievement to failure, beauty to ugliness, and truth to error. What- ever refinements in our conception of these five values the ethical philosophers may work out, it is highly probable that the durable goods of life lie under these five headings. As a nation, we have not yet attained these values in reasonable measure by any possible yardstick. In more normal times a third of our people were said to be ill housed, ill clothed, and ill fed. A great many lack medical care. Our public health services are still negligible as compared with what we already know how to do. One in every twelve to fifteen of us spends some time in a mental hospital. Most of us are probably neurotic to some extent and are driven by internal pres- sures to make life a burden to ourselves and our associates. We are all in serious danger of having our lives ended by atomic bombs. In the realm of right relations with others, one out of every three marriages is said now to end in divorce, and many others are unhappy. The birth rate declines as rapidly as people find out how to make it do so. The relationships of parents and children, as ev- ery teacher knows, are far from satisfactory. The circle of friends of the average American family is unduly narrow and grows narrower after the age of forty, abetted by our no- madic habit of moving almost annually. The status of women is still inferior, while that of old age is pitiable. There are well-defined classes in our society, based not on personal worth but on race, religion, and economic status, with little friendly contact between classes. Our economic system assumes that the man who has capital has the right to make decisions, in his own interest, which affect the lives and fortunes of all the rest of us. Our public affairs, especially in cities, are usually grossly mismanaged. Our foreign re- lations are still almost anarchic and consti- tute the gravest menace to the future of human life. At the moment our sense of achievement has abundant scope, but in more normal times millions are unemployed and millions more are employed in drudgery which offers little possibility of a sense of achievement. We may count on the fact that, with the disruption of the world economy by war and the exhaustion of our national credit, the students now in our classes will live through a period of economic chaos which will make the last depression seem trivial. In the realm of aesthetic experience, it is fair to say that, in spite of a few notable achievements, we are still cultural barbari- ans. The reading habits of American adults have already been noted. Our cities, by and large, are blots on the landscape. Our Ameri- can suburban architecture is more appropri- ate for doll houses than for the habitations of grown men and women. The modern miracle of radio provides subhuman enter- tainment about 95 per cent of the time and could not find an audience for anything better. We still have flowers and sunsets and pretty girls, but, in spite of these resources, it is safe to say that our people rarely feel the impact of beauty. With regard to the discovery, dissemina- tion, and integration of "truth" or meaning, our scientific development appears to be in a healthy condition, our philosophic and hu- manistic development somewhat less so. In this area the central problem of our time is probably rooted in the fact that the major- ity of our people are no longer members of any church, and the majority of church members seem to lack the depth of convic- tion which, in the past, made religion the center of orientation in life. We keep on</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION I3' being "good" out of habit, because we were so taught by our forebears who had a reason for being "good" in this fashion. We no longer accept that reason. Unless we can find a new one, it can only be a question of time before the habit breaks down. Civilization cannot coast along indefinitely on moral inertia. It is characteristic of our time that whole nations have tried to substitute a political faith for the old faith in religion. While I do not approve of this solution, I must admit that today one has to turn to zealots of the new political creeds to understand what Christianity did for people during its apos- tolic era. Our students who have acquired a passionate belief in the teachings of Karl Marx become quite objectionable in many ways (as did the early Christians, no doubt), but they have undeniably something to live for-something which gives them a whole new orientation in life, disciplines them, and channels their energy. We are told on good authority that Fascist youth in Germany and Italy felt the same invigorating stir of a new idea, the same sense of devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The recent attempts of the schools to rebuild a passion- ate faith in democracy were undoubtedly suggested in part by the tonic effect on young people of Communist and Fascist doctrines. My objection to the political solution is that it is incomplete: it leaves out many values which ought to be included in a faith which can direct and sustain life in the twentieth century. Science, for example, is something in which our young people de- voutly believe, and which has no real con- nection with any political creed, although all such creeds try to claim it as their own. Health, love, achievement, and beauty are also independent values which fit awkward- ly into political schemes. It is instructive to read some of our own apologists for democ- racy trying to prove that art, motherhood, religion, and scientific method are all part and parcel of the democratic ideal. It may be argued that, once religious faith declines, only a political faith has suf- ficient energy and generality to provide a new center of orientation. I know of one his- torical instance to the contrary which may be trivial, or it may be very important in opening our minds to the possibility of some- thing completely different from a political faith operating in a culture as a source of philosophic integration. It was the humanis- tic movement of the Renaissance. I have not studied the period with scholarly exactness, but it appears to me that these early hu- manists suddenly became infected with the spirit of the ancient classics as the Apostles became infected with the teachings of Christ and as our students become infected with Marx. They traveled about in much the same fashion, discovering lost manuscripts, visiting other enthusiasts, lecturing, and founding schools. They seem to have caught a new vision of what life could be like: life on a more heroic scale than the scholastic tradition permitted, with breath-taking in- tellectual freedom and energy, with a fresh perception of beauty, and with the sinister lure of paganism, in spite of their professions to the contrary, at the back of it all. Before it ebbed, the movement reached a surprising number of people. I used to believe that Latin continued to be taught even in our time because it was really useful to a scholar up to the fifteenth century. I now believe I was wrong; it was the new schools, founded by the Renaissance humanists, with an al- together fresh and different passion for the ancient classics, which dominated the intel- lectual tradition of Europe from the six- teenth century down to the nineteenth. It is hard to believe now that these ancient texts once kindled a whole new vision of life in large numbers of people all over Europe, and that the movement they started in educa- tion lasted well over three hundred years- but it happened. A similar movement may be taking shape before our own eyes, now that the Great Books have a foundation, a program, and thousands of fresh converts every day. My criticisms of the classical view of education should not be taken to imply that I think the Great Books program, among adults,</page><page sequence="10">132 ETHICS will not serve as a possible basis for the philosophic development and integration of our people. I am not certain that it will, but I would not deny the possibility. There is historical precedent for it. Whatever may be the solution of this cen- tral intellectual problem of our time, it is clear that the schools can and must do a great deal on humbler levels to make pos- sible the attainment of the five major values discussed in this paper. Once these values are accepted, it is fairly easy to discover what attitudes, habits, knowledge, and skills increase the chances of attaining them, and this is a question which is clearly amenable to scientific investigation. These kinds of competence should be regarded not only as educational objectives but as virtues. Good conduct means doing the things which they imply, and the good man is one who does them habitually and well. They are good be- cause the more they are practiced by every- one the better are everyone's chances of attaining a good life. Deviations from them hurt not only the individual but all mem- bers of his society. Unless most people prac- tice them most of the time, none of us can attain a good life. Our moral obligation as teachers is to see to it that all the children of all our people learn to behave in these ways and to understand why it is imperative that they do so. This attitude may seem dog- matic and even ominous in view of the pre- vailing laissez faire attitude toward objec- tives, but until we teachers have an ethical theory so convincing to us that we live by it personally and believe it with religious in- tensity, our objectives are not likely to in- fluence what we teach.
