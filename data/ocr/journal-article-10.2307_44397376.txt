INTRODUCTION Eleven years ago the IPCC [1] considered that, "The climate system is a coupled non- linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible". Despite this insight, it went on to make many predictions of future climate states using non-linear models with a propensity for chaotic behaviour. This paper looks at the issues of non-linearity and chaos from the viewpoint of a modeller from a different discipline (soil science) and considers how these issues might affect the modelling of global warming. It then examines a general modelling question, the relative roles of modelling and experimentation, which points us to a crucial issue in the global warming debate. Finally, bearing in mind the failure of the IPCC models to predict the effective cessation of warming since 1998, it suggests that future climate states are best predicted by the approach of Landsheidt [2]. 2. NON-LINEARITY Non-linearity has various consequences in natural and modelled systems but two of them, error propagation in models [3] and chaos [4,5], are particularly relevant in this context. Error propagation has consequences when you run models with parameters and also when you obtain parameters by fitting to data. With chaos, we have to consider two problems: those arising from chaos in the system (in this case the climate) and those arising from chaotic behaviour in models for the system. 3. ERROR PROPAGATION, RUNNING MODELS AND FITTING TO DATA With error propagation, we are particularly interested in the interaction between non- linearity and error [3] which means that if the model is non-linear then the error in the input contributes to the mean of the output as well as its error. Thus when running the model, we really need an estimate of the error of the input as well as its mean to get a true value of the mean of the output. Getting reliable parameter values is just as important as developing valid models. The most reliable way of getting a parameter value is to measure it, but this will often not be possible and some form of fitting procedure will be needed. Fitting implies simply that you get the parameter value by finding the value that causes the model to</page><page sequence="2">1296 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 23, No. 8, 2012 give the best fit to measurements, but this is not always as easy as it sounds. One complication is that the interaction between non-linearity and error affects not only the running of models but any fitting procedure used to obtain their parameters [6]. Thus model predictions are exposed twice over to problems from the interaction if the parameter was obtained by fitting. They are also exposed twice over to any error (in the sense of fault) in the model. Another problem with fitting is that the model is unlikely to be perfect, so the imperfection in the model will influence the value of the parameter. Further problems arise if you try to fit two or more parameters simultaneously. Several combinations of parameters may give equally acceptable fits to the measurements so that you cannot be sure which combination is the correct one [7]. The hydrological modellers Beven and Binley [8] reached the rather pessimistic conclusion that they wished "to avoid the idea that there is one set of parameter values that can, with any given model structure, represent a catchment area when it is known that the model structure is in error." They proceeded from this standpoint to Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), a system of modelling that presumes multiple sets of values may be equally likely as simulators of a catchment. Is this true of climate modelling? 4. ERROR PROPAGATION AND FORECAST SKILL Tennekes et al. evolved a slogan for weather forecasters [9], 'No forecast is complete without a forecast of forecast skill.' (By forecast skill they seem to have meant the accuracy of the forecast.) An a priori understanding of error propagation in the model used would go some way towards meeting his slogan. Unfortunately, the huge complexity of climate models makes error propagation almost impossible to assess comprehensively. Tennekes claims that the slogan about 'forecast skill' gave impetus to the now common procedure of 'Ensemble Forecasting' in climate modelling, but he does not feel that the procedure gives an adequate assessment of forecast skill because it does not address properly the problem of error propagation. 5. CHAOS: THE LAND-OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE CONTINUUM Chaos in the climate matters because chaotic systems are unpredictable and become more so with time [4]. They cannot therefore be readily modelled. The entire Climate Change edifice depends on modelling the climate, so this is an important topic. Chaotic systems also show extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, a key characteristic. The climate does not exist independently of the land and the ocean, so we really ought to think in terms of the 'land-ocean-atmosphere continuum' (e.g. Shukla [10]). This massive and highly complex system includes many non-linearities and feed- backs and is almost certainly chaotic. It might even be that the chaos is necessary for the proper functioning of the climate, just as a healthy heart has a chaotic beat. One interesting characteristic of chaotic systems is that they include regions that are not chaotic. Although in many respects the climate is likely to be chaotic and consequently unpredictable and not amenable to modelling, there will be some areas that offer some measure of predictability. [10] But do we know which parts? Shukla [10]</page><page sequence="3">Climate change and modelling 1297 suggests that the most predictable part of the continuum will possibly be the North- west sector of the Pacific Ocean, particularly if sea-surface temperatures can be predicted. .But whether the land-ocean-atmosphere continuum for the whole globe is predictable remains very much an open question. 6. CHAOS IN CLIMATE MODELS The unpredictability arising from chaos in the climate is not the only problem for climate modellers. The climate models themselves can behave chaotically and one of the very first manifestations of chaos to be discovered was found in a weather model by Lorenz [11] nearly fifty years ago. He was doing some runs of the weather model when he repeated part of a run. But he put in the value of 0.506 that was on the print- out for a variable instead of the 0.506127 that the computer had held at that point in the previous run. The difference, less than one in a thousand, caused the weather to diverge so rapidly from the pattern of the previous run that within just a few (simulated) months, all resemblance had disappeared. What Lorenz had discovered was the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, mentioned above. The sensitivity arises in a model from the accumulation of minute discrepancies during the running of the model. Lorenz drew the drastic conclusion from his discovery that no long-term weather predictions were possible. It is arguably the most widely-ignored conclusion in science. The length of time ahead for which an adequate prediction can be made is known as the prediction horizon. The sensitivity to initial conditions is at the root of the finite prediction horizon issue for weather and possibly climate models. If a minute discrepancy in initial conditions can cause a major difference in the simulated weather within a few months, can the model be considered reliable when simulating the weather over longer periods? In fact, Tennekes, mentioned above seems to see the prediction horizon for weather forecasts as between two and ten days. The forecasts that come by computer from the Meteorological Office are for the next five days but the forecast is usually revised well before the fifth day. The case for Global Warming has typically been made using computer simulations of years or decades, so the prediction horizon, which is a problem when you are modelling the weather for a few days, is surely a very big problem for climate simulations lasting years or even decades? Tennekes (Personal communication, 2006) told me that forecasts for several decades were based on an averaging process which suppressed rapid fluctuations and may not be sensitive to initial conditions. The prediction horizon problem may have been avoided, but how much the model represented reality after being manipulated in this way is open to question. Tennekes added that there were reliability problems with the models and that error propagation was likely to be a problem. It seems therefore that both error propagation and chaotic behaviour remain unresolved issues for the climate models. But they are not the main reason for skepticism about orthodox views of climate change and that is discussed next.</page><page sequence="4">1298 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 23, No. 8, 2012 7. MODELLIING VERSUS EXPERIMENTS OR MEASUREMENTS Twenty years ago Philip [12] raised concern about the extent to which results from models have taken the place of results from experiments and measurements in the teaching of students and the making of policy. The problem has intensified greatly since his time, not least because Climate Change theory depends so greatly on the results of modelling. Philip's concern points us to the important principle a result from an experimental measurement must take precedence over a result from a model, other things being equal. The idea that the warming in the run-up to 2000 was attributable to carbon dioxide was based almost entirely on climate modelling, and the principle above suggests that there should have been a check that there were no experimental measurements that took precedence on the issue. There is no record that IPCC made any such check but Taylor [13] did. 8. WHAT ACTUALLY CAUSED 'GLOBAL WARMING'? Taylor [13] examined the literature relating to cloud cover and to short-wave radiation reaching the earth's surface for the period leading up to 2000, the time of the temperature increase that led to the Global Warming scare. In his book, he discussed several reviews of satellite data and then stated (p. 79 of Taylor [13]). "None of the high-level reviews cited above, often involving several institutes worldwide and published in the leading science journals, consider that calibration problems in the satellite data are grounds for discounting the key finding that short-wave radiation flux increased during the Global Warming period and that this was due to decreasing cloud cover." He had earlier said of the cloud cover (p. 71) that, "there has been a marked decrease between 1980 and 2000 in low-level reflective cloud, and an increase in high- level cirrus cloud, neither of which is predicted by the (orthodox) models and both of which have Global Warming potential." Taylor had found conclusive evidence that the warming could be fully explained by measured natural changes in cloud cover and incident short-wave radiation without any recourse to anthropogenic carbon dioxide at all. Furthermore, changes in cloud cover not only explained the warming from 1980 to 2000, they also explained the absence of warming from about 2000 onwards, a topic on which the IPCC modellers are conspicuously silent. If we follow the principle that results from measurements take precedence over results from models, all that computer modelling is now redundant. The experimental data Taylor found in the literature and the conclusions he drew from them are readily accessible, but neither seems to have been challenged. He has conveyed them to the IPCC but without any result [13]. His work seems to offer the soundest available grounds for skepticism about anthropomorphic climate change. 9. PREDICTING FUTURE CLIMATE STATES The record for the last 150 years suggests that the temperature is unlikely to remain static for very long, but which way is it going to move? In 2000 the IPCC [1] did not think the prediction of future climate states was possible, and the failure of its models to predict that there would be no further increase in global temperature beyond 1998</page><page sequence="5">Climate change and modelling 1 299 suggests it was right with respect to those models. But there are other modelling approaches and Taylor [13] drew attention to the predictive work of Landscheidt [2], commenting (his p. 227) that, "Landscheidt had an impressive list of publications while working with NASA and a track record of accurate predictions of ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) events as well as (sunspot) cycle 23 which he predicted (correctly as it emerged) would be down on the previous cycle at a time when NASA expected it to rise." (My insertions in brackets.). Sunspot activity is characterized by a cycle, the solar magnetic or Schawabe cycle, whose length was shown [14] to be correlated with the mean surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. The variations in the length of this cycle are subject to a much longer cycle, the Gleissberg cycle which lasts about 80 years. Like other cycles, the Gleissberg has maxima and minima of solar activity and Landscheidt [2] found that the maxima tend to coincide with warm temperatures and the minima with cool, and both could be predicted from the angular momentum of the sun. 10. LANDSCHIEDT AND THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF THE SUN The angular momentum of the sun has two components. One derives from its spin about its own axis. The other, the orbital component, is the result of the sun's barycentric oscillations, its irregular oscillations about the centre of mass of the solar system, and is regulated by the changing spatial distribution of the masses of the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (as deduced by Newton three centuries ago). Landscheidt [2] used the sun's angular momentum to predict the minima and maxima of the Gleissberg cycle as follows. The angular momentum L defines the dynamics of the sun's motion about the centre of mass of the solar system. Its rate of change with time dL/dt defines the rotatary force, the torque T driving the sun's motion about the centre of mass. Because the solar system is so well understood, the changes in the torque with time dT/dt can be calculated for hundreds of years forwards or backwards in time. Crucially for Landscheidt's ideas, the minima and maxima in dT/dt coincide well over centuries with the minima and maxima of the Gleissberg cycle [2], giving a very useful empirical relationship for predicting them. When the minimum in dT/dt goes below a threshold value it signals a period of very weak solar activity and low temperatures. The Maunder minimum was a period of very low solar activity and cold temperatures which occurred during the 17th Century and formed part of the so-called 'Little Ice Age' which started in the 14th Century. The Maunder minimum was signalled by two consecutive minima in dT/dt that went below the threshold, as were the cold periods around 1000, 1300 and 1500. A single minimum in dT/dt signalled the onset of the Dalton minimum, a period in the 19th Century which was cold but less severe than the Maunder event. A maximum in dT/dt signals a warm period such as the medieval one or the one that has just occurred. 11. WARMER OR COOLER? Landscheidt [2] computed dT/dt up to 2300. The next minimum he predicted will be in 2030 and, unfortunately, there are three consecutive minima in dT/dt that went below the threshold, implying that a Maunder-type event with extended low solar</page><page sequence="6">1300 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 23, No. 8, 2012 activity and cool temperatures is likely. He also predicted a Dalton minimum for 2122 and a Maunder minimum for 2201. Landscheidťs prediction of cooling as we head towards 2030 has been corroborated independently by other authors. Klyashtorin and Lyubushin [15] fitted a cyclic function to global surface temperatures between 1861 and 2000 and extrapolated the function from 2000 to 2030. The resulting prediction, made in about 2001 and published in 2003, was that the global temperature would level off over the following 5-10 years and decline by 0.1 to 0.15 °C during the 2020s. Archibald [16] forecast a decrease in temperature of 1-2 °C between 2000 and 2030 from studies on the progress of recent solar cycles. He also calculated that the projected increase in carbon dioxide concentration in this time, 40 ppm, would lead to an increase in temperature of 0.04 °C, implying that the anthropogenic contribution to temperature change will be insignificant by comparison with natural variation. The years around 2030 may be a hard time. If Landscheidt was right, the world will have to cope not only with cooler conditions but also with the social, political and financial aftermath of the great Global Warming scare, the strangest episode of mass delusion since flying saucers.
