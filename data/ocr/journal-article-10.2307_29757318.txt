<plain_text><page sequence="1">Butkara II Revisited by Christina Caroline Fritsch This article is an exploratory study that examines the relationship between various aspects of the treatment accorded the dead at the protohistoric graveyard of Butkara II (Swat, Pakistan). Forty-four graves and four pits were excavated in 1961 by Dr Maurizio Taddei, under the auspices of the Italian Archaeological Mission, Swat, Pakistan and published by Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul (1972: 431-93). Previous analyses and reviews of the material (Stacul 1996, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977; Salvatori 1975; M?ller-Karpe 1981) have concentrated on determining the place of Butkara II in the chronological development of the protohistoric graveyards in the Swat Valley. The internal development witnessed in the mortuary remains at Butkara II has remained unexamined by previous authors (Stacul 1966, 1969, 1970; Salvatori 1975: 334), convinced, that the 'remarkable homogeneity' of the material culture from the protohistoric graveyards of Butkara II, Loebanr I and Katelai I supported the analysis of the material in a unitary manner. This approach was justified in the past, by the primary aim, being the elucidation of a relative chronology based on pottery typologies. Preliminary statistical analyses undertaken in this study, have indicated that the internal development of the mortuary complex at Butkara II, does not support that proposed for Loebanr I and Katelai I. This raises serious doubts as to whether it is feasible to treat the material from the protohistoric graveyards in a 'unitary manner', and argues for the analysis of the material within its specific context. Only by examining the internal dynamics of the development of the graveyards as distinct units, and then by comparing the ways in which the mortuary complex is manipulated, will it be possible to draw a more representative idea of the treatment accorded the dead by the groups inhabiting the Swat valley in the protohistoric period. Caution must be exercised in interpreting the results, as only a small area of the graveyard was excavated. It is not possible to determine at this stage, whether the forty-four graves excavated, are representative of the treatment accorded the dead in the larger graveyard and therefore over-generalizations of the data should be avoided. This does not detract from the ability of the mortuary evidence to indicate changes in the larger socio-cultural system of the community in protohistoric times. The graves at Butkara II have been assigned a time frame, from the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C. to the 4th century B.C. Radiocarbon dating of seven graves gave [1] 41</page><page sequence="2">a consistent date of 2425 ?40 (475 B.C.), but as the graves were not identified, it is not possible to determine their relative chronological placing (Alessio, Bella &amp; Bachechi 1966: 361-62). Discussion of relative dates for the periods at Butkara II must await further research and comparison of the periodization of the graves at Loebanr II and Katelai I. The chronological development of the typological complex at Butkara II is divided into two periods and two phases: Period I A, IB and II. These periods have a distinct typological complex. In Period I A, the grave assemblages consist of pottery of Grey Thin-sided Ware and ornaments of gold, silver and copper. The rite of cremation is prevalent with the remains being placed in 'eye-bearing urns' of type VTf68. Period IB, can only be considered a transitional phase between the typological complexes of Period IA and II. The Grey Thin-sided Ware characteristic of the grave assemblages of Period IA is gradually replaced by Red Thin-sided Ware. The repertoire of grave goods becomes restrictive compared to the diversity of types found in the graves of Period IA. The inclusion of gold and copper ornaments in graves of this period is rare. The rite of cremation is replaced by that of inhumation. In Period II, a change is noted in the grave assemblages. Grey Thin-sided Ware characteristic of Period IA has disappeared. The typological complex is characterized by Red Thin-sided Ware, with the rare occurrence of metal instruments. The inclusion of fragments of iron in some of the graves attests to the use of iron. The repertoire of types included in the grave assemblages is extremely restrictive and repetitious compared to the types of the previous periods. The rite of inhumation is firmly established with the isolated occurrence of a cremation burial. The primary aim of this study was to identify the significant relationships between the variables of the treatment accorded the dead in the mortuary complex at Butkara II. The statistical analysis of the material from all periods indicated that, whilst there were changes in the grave assemblages, the major discriminator in the treatment of the dead was the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities and the types of grave-goods placed within these cavities. The differential treatment accorded the dead appears not to be based on age or sex divisions. It was noted though, that burials of infants 0-12/13 years were rare and this may indicate that these individuals were excluded from burial in the graveyard. The change in the typological complex from Period IA to Period II may represent an internal evolution in ways of doing things, especially in the production of pottery, but may also indicate an external change or influence on the community buried at Butkara II. Though the aim of this study was not to recreate the socio-political or economic structure of the community, it was felt appropriate to introduce some fundamental theoretical approaches commonly employed by archaeologists in the analysis of mortuary remains. The application of these theoretical paradigms to the results, indicated that the mortuary remains at Butkara II, could not simply be explained by the use of a predetermined model, and emphasized that the internal development and changes witnessed at Butkara II, need to be examined in relation to the graveyards of 42 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Loebanr and Katelai I and other aspects of the 'total cultural system', such as settlement sites. Method The database was constructed using the published report by Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul (1972). The material from T.l was included in the database, though the grave was disturbed and some of the material was not found in situ. Seven pots found on the covering slabs of T.27, which Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul (1972: 464) associate with another unexcavated grave, have been included in the grave assemblage of T.27. The typological classifications used are the same as those employed by the authors with the exception of AA. The analysis of the skeletal remains by Alciati (1967) indicated that some of the cinerary urns contained two individuals. AA therefore refers to multiple cremation burials. Several other terms need clarification. In the seriation analysis the following capitals indicate: F (female), M (male), I (Infant), J (Juvenile), A (Adult) and MA (Mature). Where you have two capitals in age/sex it indicates a multiple burial, with the individuals age followed by their sex. For example IA indicates an Infant and Adult in one grave. Age divisions are as follows: Infant I (0-6 years), Infant II (6/7-12/13 years), Juvenile (12/13-21 years), adult (21-40 years) and mature (40-59 years) (Alciati 1967: 9). In the cremation burials, Alciati (1967) does not distinguish between Infant I and Infant II and therefore the entire age range must be taken into consideration. The analysis of the material was undertaken using two statistical packages: IAGRAVES developed by the Institute of Archaeology, London and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSSx). Two programmes incorporated in IAGRAVES, SERIATE and JACCARD were used extensively in the analysis. SERIATE incorporates two methods of analysis: 1) Doran's R measure and 2) Wilkinson's score, both of which were employed in determining a relative chronology for Butkara II (Duncan et al. 1989). Doran's R measure simply sums the ranges of column incidences, whilst Wilkinson's score allows for density and invokes a gamma function (Duncan et al. 1989: 3). The programme JACCARD incorporates Single Linkage Cluster Analysis and Principal Co-ordinates Analysis which allows data to be tabulated and cross-associations inspected (Duncan et al. 1989: 2). The major advantage of this multivariate technique is that it provides preliminary indications of major groups of related types and their sex and age linkage. SPSSx was used primarily to test the significance of the relationship between variables.

These graves were excluded from further analysis, though retained in the seriation analysis for interest. There were no indications in the preliminary analysis to support the exclusion of multiple burials as suggested by Salvatori (1975). Though there is evidence to suggest that the articulated skeletons in T.21 and T.26 are later burials, analysis of the grave assemblage did not indicate that these burials belong to a later period than that of the earlier burial. All graves other than those previously identified as pits were included in the analysis. Chronology Seriation of the data by Doran's R measure and Wilkinson's score produced fairly consistent results in the ordering of the graves. As there appeared to be no major discrepancies between the methods, Wilkinson's score has been reproduced in Fig. 1. Two major periods and two phases have been identified, Period IA, IB and II. These periods were checked using Single Linkage Cluster Analysis to identify the graves of maximum similarity. Salvatori (1975: 338) proposed four periods for Butkara II, Period I, II, Intermediate and III based on counts of association. The seriation analysis and Single Linkage Cluster Analysis did not support these divisions. The division between Period IA and Period IB was placed at the point where the graves exhibited the lowest levels of similarity with Period IA graves. There is a clear division in typology between Period IB and Period II, as the later period is characterized by a distinct typological assemblage. The specific typological nature of the periods will be highlighted below. Period I phase A is the earliest phase attested to at Butkara II. Salvatori (1975: 334) in his analysis of the chronological development of the graveyards suggests that one or two of the graves at Butkara II attest to an earlier period amply documented at Katelai I and Loebanr I. This cannot be confirmed, as the extent of this analysis is only the material from Butkara II. Period IA is characterized by a specific typological complex of types; Bowls on Stands ? VTc5, VTc5I, VTc8, VTc8I; Vessels with Deep Body ? VTc20; Biconical Vessels ? VTc29; Vessels with Out-turned Rim ? VTc32, VTc36, VTc38; Bottles ? VTb42, VTb44, VTc45, VTbd45, VTc47, VTc50, VTc51, VTc53; Jars ? VTf68, VTf70, VTf71; Jar lids ? VTf75, VTf75I; Miniature vases ? VTbd82; Ornaments: Rings ? OMal, OMcl, OMc2; Pins ? OMa6, OMal3, TMal9, TMb21; Spindle-whorls ? TT1, TT2; Concave disk ? TT25; Beads ? OSd26, and fragments of silver sheet (FSS). There are isolated incidences of types; FT8, OB18, OMa5, OMa27, OMa40, OSd20, OSa24, OSb24, TB22, TMa7, VTbl, VTclOI, VTcl4, VTbdl5, VTal8, VTc41I, VTb45, VTf74, VTf75II, VTb78I, copper fragments (CF) and fragments of silver (FOS). These isolated types are restricted to individual graves in Period IA and are indicated in Fig. 1 by the symbol ?. The pottery is predominantly class c, Grey Thin-sided Ware, though there are a couple examples [5] 45</page><page sequence="6">of class b ware, Red Thick-sided Ware, that is associated with an earlier phase at Katelai I and Loebanr I (Stacul 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971; Salvatori 1975). The metal objects are predominantly made of copper with the occasional occurrence of a gold ornament. There is evidence of the use of silver fragments or sheets in several of the graves. By the end of Period IA types; VTc38, VTb44, VTc45, VTc47, VTf75, OMc2, OMal3, TT2, TMal9 and fragments of silver sheet have disappeared. The isolated types mentioned earlier have also disappeared. The typological complex of Period IB retains many of the types of Period IA, with the addition of Bowls on Stands ? VTc6, VTd6, VTd6I, VTd8; Bowl ? VTc9; Vessels with Deep Body ? VTd20; Biconical vessels ? VTc26; Vessels with Out turned Rim ? VTc33, VTd40; Bottles ? VTd59; Miniature vases ? VTd80, VTd81, and fragments of iron (FIR). There are isolated occurrences of types TMa20, VTacl4, VTbl4, VTa21, VTbd21, VTc33I, VTc40, VTc41, VTc59 and VTa83. Early in this period the pottery is predominantly class c, Grey Thin-sided Ware, but as the period progresses class d, Red Thin-sided Ware is introduced. The metal industry is predominantly copper, though there is evidence to suggest the introduction and use of iron. By the end of the period the following types characteristic of Period IA disappear; VTc5, VTc5I, VTc8, VTc8I, VTc20, VTc29, VTc32, VTc36, VTb42, VTbd45, VTc50, VTc51, VTc53, VTf75I, OMcl, OMa6, TMb21, TT1 and OSd26. All the isolated types have disappeared by the end of this period. Types VTc6 and VTc26 which first make there appearance in this period also disappear. Period II heralds a break from the typological complexes of Period IA and IB. To the limited number of remaining types of Period IB can be added Bowls on Stands ? VTd8I; Cup ? VTdlO; Biconical vessels ? VTd28, VTd29; Vessels with Out-turned Rim ? VTd41; Jar ? VTf72I; Knife ? TMal9 and Concave disk ? TT25. Types VTbd82, TT25 and TMal9 which were previously restricted to Period IA make a reappearance in Period II. Types of long duration VTf68, VTf70, VTf71 and OMal are less frequent in this period. The following types are isolated occurrences; FT1, OMa9, TMbl5, TMd5, VTd3, VTc9, VTbd9, VTc32I, VTd33, VTd33I, VTd36, VTd39, VTd48, VTd58, VTb66, VTf72II, VTd82 and VTa83. The pottery is predominantly class d, Red Thin-sided Ware with the occasional occurrence of class c ware. The metal industry is predominantly copper, with the inclusion of iron and silver instruments. The repertoire of grave-goods in Period II is restricted when compared to the diversity of the grave assemblages in the preceding periods. The seriation analysis was unable to assign the following graves T.04, T.22 and T.44 to any of the three periods due to the small quantity of grave-goods. These graves have been attributed to the periods in which they share the maximum level of similarity with other types. The occurrence of type VTf75, which is characteristic of Period IA indicates that grave T.44 can be attributed to this phase. The other graves T.04 and T.22 have been attributed to Period IB, as type VTc32I is a variant of VTc32 which is characteristic of Period IB. 46 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Decorative Motifs The chronological sequence of types proposed here for Butkara II is supported in the analysis of design elements. The design elements or decorative motifs are distinct for each of the three periods. In all three periods decorated pottery is predominant. The design elements or decorative motifs occur either singularly, in pairs, or in groups of three to four designs. The decorative motifs appear to be restricted to 'decorative bands' or areas of the pots. It is the repetition of these designs as a group or single entity within a grave that establish links of similarity with graves in the same period. Two or three graves may use a specific aspect of the design group that is not used by other graves in the same period. The design elements for each period will be listed. The design elements or decorative motifs are classified according to Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul (1972). It was notable that within each period there also were types of pottery that were not decorated. The following design elements are found on types associated with Period IA; Ribbed decoration ? Dl, D2, D3, D5; Incised decoration ? D7, D7 irregular, D9, D9I, D10, Dil, D14, D17, D18, D24, D25; Incised decoration ? composite patterns ? D39, D40, D44, D44I; Ribbed and Incised decoration ? composite patterns ? D61, D61I, D63; Decoration in relief ? D66, D67, D67I, D67II, D67III, D69II; Holes ? D70, D71, D72; Ribbed and knobbed decoration ? D75 and D76. Design elements D76, D72, D69II, D67III, D67II, D67, D63, D44I, D40, D25, D24, D18, and D17 are isolated examples and occur in single cases. The isolated design elements can be divided into those that occur singularly or those incorporated in a group with frequently occurring elements. Singular isolated designs elements include D18, D67, D67II, D67III, D72 and D76. The remaining isolated examples all occur as part of a group of frequently occurring design elements. By the cessation of this period design elements D7 irregular, D9I, D17, D18, D24, D25, D44I, D63, D67, D67I, D67II, D67III, D69II, D70, D72 and D76 have disappeared. In Period I A, the most frequently occurring design element is Dl which is made up of series of ribs. Dl is equally employed as the sole decorative motif or as part of a decorative group. The next most frequently employed design elements are D2, an isolated rib, very pronounced and Dil a horizontal zigzag line. It was interesting to note that Dil is always incorporated into a decorative motif and never occurs singularly. D2, on the other hand is employed as the sole decorative motif or as part of a larger decorative group. In this period, it is interesting to note the diversity of the design repertoire, especially in the incorporation of several design elements into decorative groups or motifs which often become quite elaborate. Though many similarities exist between these more complex decorative motifs, there are as many differences. The design groups may be basically similar except for the incorporation of an isolated design element. Whether these design elements are relegated to the idiosyncratic, or form an integral and important symbolic part of the larger decorative motif, will be examined in a later study. Design elements D70 [7] 47</page><page sequence="8">(two round holes in horizontal sequence); D71 (group of three holes arranged in a triangle) and D72 (group of three round holes, the central one larger than the others) form an important group in this period. These design elements are generally found perforated in the body and shoulder region of the cinerary urn VTf68. These decorative motifs are anthropomorphic in appearance. The fact that these designs occur on the cinerary urns of this period would suggest some form of symbolic meaning. In Period IB the following design elements can be added to those remaining from Period IA; Incised decoration ? D8, D9 irregular, Dil irregular, Dill, D12, D22, D30, D31, D32; Incised decoration ? composite patterns ?D36I, D38, D50; Ribbed and incised decoration ? composite patterns ? D62, D66I; Decoration in relief ? D69 and Ribbed and knobbed decoration ? D77. In this period a large number of the design elements appear to be isolated incidences. These elements include D8, D12, D30, D32, D36I, D39, D40, D44, D62, D66, D66I, D69, D71, D75 and D77. It is interesting to note that design elements D39, D44, D66, D66I, D71 and D75 which are isolated cases in Period IB, appeared in several incidences in Period IA. These design elements disappear very early in Period IB, and mirror the transition in pottery from Period IA types to those of Period II. Towards the end of this period, design elements D8, D9, D9 irregular, Dil irregular, D12, D22, D30, D32, D36I, D61, D62, D66, D66I, D69 and D77 disappear. In this period, Dl still occurs but less so than in the previous period. There is a marked increase in the incorporation of design elements D2; D5 (band of grooves); Dil and D14 (horizontal sequence of dots), into more complex decorative motifs. D2 and D5 appear frequently, as single design elements on pottery throughout this period. In this period, there is a move towards a more restrictive repertoire, as other design elements are restricted to two occurrences, though not always in similar decorative motifs. The tendency towards a more restrictive repertoire in the use of design element and decorative motifs is reflected in the limited range of pottery types incorporated in the graves. There is a single occurrence of D71 on pottery type VTf68 in an inhumation burial. VTf68 is also found in two other incidences decorated with motifs other than those identified with the cinerary urns of Period IA. All other occurrences of VTf68 are undecorated. The incidence of D71 on type VTf68 early in the period suggests the waning of types associated with Period IA. Period II marks a break from the design repertoire of the preceding periods. To the remaining design elements from Period IB, can be added D4, D5 irregular; Incised decoration ? D17; Incised decoration ? composite patterns ? D38 and D43. The majority of the design elements that make up the repertoire of this period, occur in isolated incidences, as part of a larger design group. The design elements that fall into this category are D4, D5 irregular, D14, D17, D38, D39, D43, D44, and D77. The basic design repertoire of this period consists of a limited number of 48 [8]</page><page sequence="9">elements that include: Ribbed decoration (Dl, D2, D3, D5) and Incised decoration (D7, D10, and Dil). The most prevalent design elements that occur singularly or together as part of a decorative motif are Dl and D5. Design elements D2 and D3 occur solely as a decorative motif on the rim or body of the pot. In this period the diversity of decorative groups is extremely limited, and this is reflected in the restricted repertoire of pottery shapes. Both design elements and types in this period are repetitious, often occurring numerous times within the one grave. Burial Rites The burial rites at Butkara II tend to reflect the general trend observed previously in the use of types and design elements in each of the periods. In Period I A, the rite of cremation is predominant (73.7%) over that of inhumation (31.6%). This sample includes one grave that contains both an inhumation and cremation burial. It is in this period that Alciati (1967) has identified five multiple cremation burials, four of them containing an infant and adult, and the fifth one, a juvenile female and a mature individual. Due to the extremely poor preservation of the skeletal evidence, it was not possible to determine whether any of the other cremation burials were multiple. It is interesting to note in this period, that the three earliest graves identified by seriation T.02, T.18, T.25 are all inhumation burials, whilst the graves immediately following are cremation burials. It is perhaps plausible to suggest that the earliest inhumation graves T.02, T.18 and T.25 at Butkara II are associated with the preceding period which is amply documented at Katelai I and Loebanr I or that the predominance of cremation burials can be attributed to a grouping of such burials within the larger graveyard of Period IA. In Period IB, there is a gradual transition from cremation (33.3%) to inhumation burials (55.5%). It is in this period that the first grave without skeletal material appears. This single cavity grave T.19 contains a number of grave-goods but no skeletal material. There is one occurrence of a triple inhumation burial containing a female infant (age 6/7-12/13 years), a juvenile female (12/13-21 years) and a mature male adult (40-59 years) (Alciati 1967: 9). Though the two female skeletons were disarticulated and swept into a pile, as is the practice when a grave is reused, there is no typological evidence to suggest that any of these burials were earlier than Period IB. In Period II, there is a marked break from the burial rites of the preceding periods. The rite of inhumation (77.7%) becomes firmly established, while cremation (7.7%) has all but disappeared. There is an increase in graves without skeletal material (15.38%). These graves are single cavity graves accompanied by an array of grave goods. The change in burial rites from Period I A, to IB to Period II is represented in Figure 2. [9] 49</page><page sequence="10">Number Fig. 2 - Burial rites for all periods. I ?Period II I Period IB I Period IA Sex and Age Distinctions There were no clear linkages in the grave assemblages to support a male-female dichotomy and/or age grades in any of the periods. This may be due to the limited skeletal evidence available, or simply to the fact that these divisions were not considered important in the burial context. It is interesting to note the paucity of the skeletal evidence in relation to the burial of individuals aged 0-12/13 years. The burials of infant children appear to be restricted to double cremation graves in Period IA, with a single occurrence in Period IB of the burial of a female infant of 6/7-12/13 years. There is no evidence to suggest that children were buried in any of the Period II graves. This may be explained by the fragile nature of young children's bones and their fast decomposition rates or simply by the fact that the majority of young individuals were excluded from burial within the graveyard. Frequency of Types The frequency of the types in each of the three periods indicated that there were some categories of grave-goods that accounted for a high proportion of the overall grave assemblages. Castaldi (1968) in her analysis of the material from graves T.46-T.80 at Katelai I notes that a third of the ceramic production consists of drinking cups with a 'sinuous profile'. At Butkara II, due to the diversity of the grave goods, 50 [10]</page><page sequence="11">10 20 30 40 NUMBER 50 60 70 I Period IAI Fig. 3 - Category frequencies for all periods. where over one third of the types are single occurrences, it was considered necessary to group the types according to larger categories. The categories follow those used by Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul (1972) in their catalogue of the protohistoric graveyards of the Swat Valley. In each of the periods it was noted that certain types of ceramics occurred in significantly larger proportions than other types in the same categories. This will be examined further in each of the periods. The categories and their frequencies for all periods are represented in Figure 3. In Period IA, the ceramic production is dominated by two major categories, that of Bowls-on-Stands (28.8%) and Bottles (28.8%). The most frequently occurring ceramic is type VTc8, which accounts for 16.3% of the total ceramic production and 56.8% of the ceramics in the category Bowls-on-Stands. It was interesting to note that VTf68, which was frequently used as the cinerary urn accounted for 67.6% of the ceramics in the category of jars and 12.9% of the total ceramic production. Bowls and Cups in this period account for only 0.56% of the total ceramic production. Ornaments in this period represented only 14.4% of the total mortuary assemblage. Miscellaneous items such as spindle-whorls, small concave disks and bodkins accounted [11] 51</page><page sequence="12">for 7% of the mortuary assemblage. The rare occurrence of metal artefacts such as knives, and harpoons is emphasized by the fact that they only account for 1.6% of the total mortuary assemblage. Bowls-on-Stands are still the most prevalent category in Period IB accounting for 24.4% of the ceramic production. Bottles in this period represent only 21% of the ceramic production followed by that of Vessels with Out-turned Rims at 15.5%. It is interesting to note the increase in the production of vessels with out-turned rims, as in Period IA, they accounted for only 6.7% of the ceramic production. The production of type VTf68 has declined markedly with it representing 50% of the ceramics in the category of jars and 6.7% of the overall ceramic production. Biconical vessels are first introduced in this period and account for 4.4% of the total ceramic production. Ornaments in this period represent only 5.7% of the mortuary assemblage with a marked decrease in the production of type OMa6. Spindle-whorls, small disks and bodkins account for only 3.3% of the mortuary assemblages. There is a marked decrease in the number of metal artefacts at 0.4%. Period II witnesses a marked increase in the production of Vessels with Out-turned Rims (30.5%), whilst Bottles now only account for 5.6% of the mortuary assemblage. Biconical vessels that first made their appearance in Period IB now account for 13% of the ceramic production. All other categories of ceramics appear to have increased in production though type VTf68 represents only 1.9% of the total ceramic production. Ornaments in Period II have become scarce representing only 1.6% of the total mortuary assemblage. Miscellaneous items in this period appear to have increased at 6.6%. This is accounted for by the unusual occurrence in grave T.09 of fourteen concave disks of type TT25. There is a single occurrence of a weapon in the form of a spear shaft and spear-head. Associations between Types The Jaccard coefficient was utilized to check for any clustering of types within each of the periods. The results of interest for each of the periods are given below. It is perhaps pertinent here, to offer a note of warning in relation to cluster analysis. Though types may cluster and be strongly associated with a burial rite, it does not mean that these types will appear in all burials of the same rite within a given period or that they are restricted to graves of a specific rite. Cluster analysis primarily indicates that these types share a level of similarity. For example they may in fact occur more frequently in graves associated with cremation burials than inhumation burials, but they do occur in inhumation burials. In Period IA, types VTc5I, VTc8, VTc53, VTf68 and VTf75 formed a cluster with type OMa6 and the rite of cremation. This, in fact, is to be expected, as the analysis indicated that in 80% of the cases VTf68 was accompanied by lid type VTf75 and used as the receptacle for cremated remains. There was a strong association in 52 [12]</page><page sequence="13">this period between double-cavity graves and types VTf68 and lid type VTf75. With the exception of three cremation graves in this period, all cremation burials occurred in double-cavity graves. A second cfuster was identified with types VTc36, VTbd45, VTc51 and OMal. It was interesting to note that types VTc47 and TT2 always occur together. There appeared to be no other indicators of clustered groups, with all types linked by generally low levels of similarity. The lack of clusters in this period may be attributed to the diversity of the repertoire of types found in the grave assemblages. In the following Period IB, the types are clustered in two general groups. The first cluster consists of types VTc5, VTc20, VTc53, VTc26, VTd6I, VTc33, VTc50, VTc8, OMa6, VTf70, VTf68 and VTc36. Also strongly associated with the types of this cluster is the burial rite of cremation. Types VTc5, VTc20 and VTc53 are strongly associated with double-cavity graves. The second cluster consists of types of low levels of similarities; VTd80, VTd20, VTc8I and VTd59. These clusters tend to represent a transition phase. Those types of Period II, that are introduced early in Period IB, are linked strongly to the remaining types of Period IA. The gradual introduction of the types of the second cluster would explain the weak links of similarity within this group and in relation to the other cluster. It is interesting to note that the following types always occur together; VTc5 and VTc20; VTc26 and VTd6I; OMa6 and VTf70; and VTc8I and VTd80. The cluster analysis of types of Period II, did not indicate any large clusters of types. There were a number of strong associations between two or three of the types. The associations that share a high level of maximum similarity are reported here. Types VTd41 and VTd6 were strongly associated with double-cavity graves. Other notable associations are VTd6I and VTd80, and VTd6 and inhumation burials. Several types always appear together in pairs. These types are OMal and VTdl5, and VTd59 and VTd8I. The types of the Period IB, that occurred together, in Period II have disappeared. This is largely due to the fact that VTc5, VTc20, VTc26 and OMa6 are associated with the typological assemblage of Period IB and have ceased by Period II. Correlations SPSSx was used to test the significance of the relationship between the variables. Though the Jaccard coefficient supplied the strength of the relationship, it was found necessary to test for the significance of the relationship. This is particularly true as some of the strong associations at point (1.000) were found to have been isolated incidences where they occurred in a single grave. The results indicated a strong non? significant relationship between many of the variables. Examination of the data indicated single occurrences and therefore they have not been included in the tables. The significant correlation coefficients for each period are presented in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. [13] 53</page><page sequence="14">Table 1 - Significant correlations for Period IA. LOW.L.

As there were significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities in all three periods, T-Tests were performed by period for upper and lower cavity size. No differences were identified between the periods. The significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities in all three periods would indicate that some form of measurement was employed in the construction of the graves. This is supported by the significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities and grave-goods. 54 [14]</page><page sequence="15">l I PeriodIA |] Period IB /^Period II ? _ lDDA A3 ?

In some instances as the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities increased, so did the number of the grave-goods. The significant relationships between the types of grave associations indicate that certain grave-goods were always placed together in certain types of burials. It was interesting to note that in all three periods there were no significant relationships between the burial rite and grave-goods. Spatial Analysis The graves for each period were plotted on a map of the graveyard to determine the spatial layout of the graves and to detect if there were any major groupings of graves. The spatial layout of the graves for each period is reproduced in Figure 4. In Period I A, the graves formed two major clusters, one on the western side of the graveyard and the other in the northeast corner. Two smaller clusters of graves [15] 55</page><page sequence="16">were identified towards the eastern side of the graveyard and in the northwest corner. The graves of Period IB tended to be dispersed evenly in a circular pattern around the periphery of the concentrations of Period IA graves. Period II graves tended to be fairly evenly dispersed in the central area of the graveyard and in the northeastern corner. Due to the tendency of the graves to form clusters in relation to the topographical layout of the graveyard, it was necessary to test whether these graves shared similar characteristics. Goldstein (1981: 53-59) states that graves that exhibit similar characteristics in the treatment of the dead will be clustered together in clearly demarcated areas of the graveyard. Single Linkage Cluster Analysis was performed for each of the three periods. The results from the Single Linkage Cluster Analysis did not support that the graves with similar characteristics are clustered together, in fact the graves with the maximum level of similarity were quite often very dispersed throughout the graveyard. This was found to be true for all periods. The possibility cannot be dismissed, that the small area excavated, may represent a clustering of similar graves in the larger graveyard. Discussion The chronology established for Butkara II, gives a precise picture of the progressive development of types and changes in the typological complex. Salvatori (1975: 334-38) in his analysis of types based on counts of association, proposed four periods for Butkara II: Period I, Period II, Intermediate and Period III. The current analysis did not substantiate the division of the typological complex into four periods. This is due to the fact that there were no significant changes detected in the typological assemblage of Period IA to warrant such a division. The analysis did indicate that Salvatori's (1975) Intermediate period is in fact the current Period IB. The only differences between the period proposed here and Salvatori's is in the ordering of the graves, and in the fact that Salvatori excluded the following Period IB graves T.01, T.19, T.26 and T.33 from analysis. In relation to Salvatori's Period III and the Period II proposed here, the only point of contention between the two analyses is in the ordering of the graves. The chronological ordering of the graves proposed by sedation, cannot be confirmed as the radiocarbon dating by Alessio et al. (1966: 408-9) on the charred bones from seven graves gave a fairly consistent date of 2425 ?40 (475 B.C.). As the publication did not supply details as to which graves were dated, the information cannot be used to confirm any of the proposed ordering of graves. The periodization of Butkara II and that of Salvatori (1975) is reproduced in Figure 5. The analysis of the material from Butkara II, indicated that the gradual development in the typological complex witnessed in Period IA and IB and then the change in Period II is reflected in all aspects of the mortuary treatment. The only 56 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Salvatori (1975) Proposed chronology Period I Period IA Period II Period IB Intermediate Period II Period III Fig. 5 - Periodization of Butkara II. constant in all periods is in relation to the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities, and in the association of grave-goods with these cavities. As this is the only significant relationship between the mortuary treatment of all periods, it is perhaps the most opportune place to start a discussion on the treatment of the dead at Butkara II. The significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities in all periods at Butkara II, indicates that some form of measurement was employed in the construction of the grave, according to a predetermined criterion. Tainter (1978) demonstrated that the amount of energy expended in the burial treatment, especially in the preparation of the burial facility, will reflect the position of the deceased in the society. The fact that no differences in cavity sizes were identified between the periods would indicate that the size of the upper and lower cavities was the major discriminator in burying the dead. This argument is given further credence by the fact that certain types of grave-goods in Period IA and Period II are associated with the dimensions of the upper and lower cavity. It may be safely assumed that the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities and the associated grave-goods indicate the position of the deceased in the community. The fact that there were no significant relationships between the sex and age of the deceased and the dimensions of the cavity, would suggest that these criteria were not considered relevant in the mortuary context. However, the paucity of skeletal evidence in relation to young children, would suggest that the majority of children were excluded from burial in the graveyard or simply buried outside the excavated area. The significant relationships between the upper and lower cavities and grave-goods indicate that certain grave-goods were placed in graves of a certain dimension. Of interest is the significant relationship between the length and width of the lower cavity and large copper pin type OMa6 and fragments of iron (FIR) in Period IA and Period II respectively. It was noted in the analysis of frequencies that as the periods progressed the presence of metal objects and ornaments in graves became noticeably scarcer. The fact that there was a significant relationship in Period IA between the length of the lower cavity and large pin OMa6 suggested that metal may be an indicator of the position [17] 57</page><page sequence="18">of the deceased. This was further indicated by the fact that there were as many occurrences of small pin type OMal3 as that of the large pin OMa6, but only the latter was significantly related to the length of the lower cavity. As the length of the lower cavity increased so did the number of large pins of type OMa6. These pins were frequently accompanied by gold rings of type OMc2. In Period II, the presence of metal objects or ornaments in the graves is very rare. It was therefore very interesting to note the significant relationship between the width of the lower cavity and fragments of iron. In the results, it was noted in Period IB that there was evidence to suggest the introduction and use of iron. Previously all objects tended to be made of copper with the rare occurrence of silver or gold ornaments. If iron in Period II was considered a rare commodity, and access to the resource was limitied, would it not therefore suggest that iron may be a status specific symbol of the deceased's position in the community. It was also interesting to note in this period that all the significant relationships between the dimensions of the lower cavity and grave-goods, FIR, VTc33 and VTd20 were highly significant (p&lt;0.1 level). This may indicate that the same dimensions were employed in the construction of the grave for deceased persons of the same position but that different grave-goods were included according to the individuals' role or access to resources. The significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities in all three periods has indicated that a great deal of energy and care was expended in determining the actual proportions of the grave. The construction of single-cavity graves would require less energy expenditure than double-cavity graves, and therefore following Tainter's (1978) energy-expenditure principle, the deceased buried in a single-cavity grave would occupy a lesser position in the community. The data was checked to establish whether there were any discernible differences in the grave assemblages between single and double-cavity graves. On average the single cavity graves had less grave-goods than the double-cavity graves. It was interesting to note that with one exception, all juvenile individuals were buried in single-cavity graves. In Period II, some of the lower cavities were lined with schist. This would require a great deal of labour at the time of the grave construction and therefore when considered in relation to the presence of iron may indicate the development of a hierarchical system. The presence of multiple burials in all periods at Butkara II creates an intriguing paradox for Tainter's (1978) energy-expenditure principle. According to this paradigm, the burial of the deceased in a previously used grave, would indicate that the deceased is of low status. This is based on the assumption that very little energy is expended in reusing a grave. The paradox arises in that multiple burials occur in both single and double-cavity graves. This would tend to indicate that factors other than the energy-expenditure principle proposed by Tainter (1978) governed the disposal of the deceased. It has already been established that the construction of upper and lower cavities answered to a precise custom, which may be indicative of the position held by the deceased in the community. The fact that a great deal of care and energy 58 [18]</page><page sequence="19">was expended in the construction of the grave for the original burial, would suggest that later burials in the grave are not 'haphazard' but answer to precise customs as to who is buried in graves of a certain dimension. The multiple burials may indeed be indicative of family or kin-related individuals who for some reason may have been interred together, e.g. sickness (Stacul 1975: 324). This hypothesis is supported by the evidence in all three periods of the age grades and sexes of the deceased. In Period IA, the multiple cremation burials contain the remains of an infant and an adult in a single cinerary urn. The evidence suggests that these individuals may have been cremated together. The multiple burial of Period IB, involves the burial of a female infant, a female juvenile and a mature male. The typological classifications of the grave assemblage indicate that the burial of the mature male occurred in the same period. As the disarticulated bones of the infant and juvenile were swept to one side it is not possible to determine the original interment. In Period II, the multiple burial of a juvenile and adult male occurs in a single cavity grave. In all periods there appears to be the indication that multiple burials do not simply represent individuals of low status but are indicative of family or kin ties. Tainter's (1978) energy-expenditure principle allows the recognition that the dimensions of the cavity may be proportionate to the deceased's social identity, but does not allow for multiple burials based on family or kin ties. Stacul (1969) Proposed chronology Period VI Period IA Period IB Period VI Period II Fig. 6 - Swat Valley sequence and the periodization of Butkara II. The significant relationships between the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities, the grave-goods and the indication that metal objects such as ornaments were considered rare commodities, would suggest that these variables were manipulated by individuals to emphasize the structure of relations in the larger community. Barret (1990: 180, 182) and Mizoguchi (1993: 223, 225) make the valid point that the mortuary context may also allow people to draw on the cultural and material resources to restructure the relationship between themselves. It must be noted that gradations detected in the mortuary treatment are not necessarily metonymically related to the socio-political organization of the community. Giddens (1981) in his model of tribal societies reminds the archaeologist that the structural principle of the community involves the kinship-based system with the traditional modes of practice and beliefs. [19] 59</page><page sequence="20">At Butkara II, the gradations in the mortuary context may indicate kinship ties and the kin group's position in the community rather than that of the individual in a socio-political organization. Fox (1980) states that as a society's priorities change in time then the order of the groups in the social structure will change though the terms of discrimination may remain the same, e.g. cavity size. This process is witnessed in the segmentary lineage system of the current inhabitants of Swat, the Yusufzai Pukhtuns (Lindholm 1996: 108, 109, 148, 149). Whilst considering the question of energy expenditure in relation to the dimensions of the grave and the deceased's position in the community, it was decided to see if the Butkara II material yielded any status-specific badges of office that would identify the burials of warriors, craftsmen, traders, priests, nobles and kings (Alekshin 1983: 142). The only evidence that grave-goods may clearly signify the occupation of the deceased occurred in Period II, grave T.09, where the deceased, a male adult, was buried with fourteen concave terracotta disks of type TT25. The disks were found resting on the covering slabs and may have been symbolic of the role of the deceased in the community. The occurrence in Period II of a spear shaft and spear-head may indicate the burial of a warrior, but this is an isolated case. It may be plausible to suggest from the evidence at Butkara II, especially in relation to metal objects, that status-specific badges of office, if used at all, were passed on to the living rather than buried with the deceased, as a sense of continuity. It is also highly probable, that status-specific badges of office, may not be recognized by western concepts of 'status' and therefore escape interpretation. The transition observed in the rite of burial at Butkara II raises some interesting questions. In Period IA, the earliest graves T.02, T.18 and T.25 are all inhumation burials. As previously suggested these burials may be attributed to an earlier period amply attested to at Katelai I and Loebanr I. It must also be considered that the inhumation burials belong to the same period as the cremation and represent the presence of co-existing burial practices. Period IA is referred to as Period VI of the Swat Valley sequence, or the Middle phase of the graveyards. In Period VI, Stacul (1975: 330) notes that at Katelai I and Loebanr I, the rite of inhumation is prevalent over that of cremation. It is therefore interesting to note that at Butkara II, there appears to be a reversal of trends, as the rite of cremation becomes predominant over that of inhumation. The cause of the reversal of trends warrants further examination. The reversal of trends in Period IA at Butkara II, might be attributed to the small number of graves excavated, and the fact that the cremation graves may represent a group within the larger graveyard of Period IA or simply to a local variation in burial practices, where cremation maintained popularity among the community buried at Butkara II. The burial rites of Period IB and Period II at Butkara II reflect the general trend observed at Loebanr I and Katelai I. Period IB and Period II at Butkara II can be attributed to Stacul's (1975) Period VII, or the Late phase of the graveyards. In Period VII the rite of inhumation is accompanied by the rare occurrence of a cremation burial. 60 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Analysis of the typological complexes for each of the three periods indicates that there was a gradual transition from a diverse range of types and decorative motifs in Period IA to an extremely repetitive and restrictive repertoire of types and motifs in Period II. In Period I A, the grave assemblages contained a diversity of pottery that in some instances were elaborately decorated. This wealth of pottery types was reflected not only in the decorative motifs but in the fact that there were a number of copper and gold ornaments placed in the graves. The graves were linked by generally low level of similarities due to the diversity of the grave assemblages where only one or two types provided the link with other graves in the period. In the early stages of Period IB, there is a diverse range of pottery which incorporates the types of Period IA as well as those of Period II. But as the period progresses the pottery becomes more restrictive due to the disappearance of types characteristic of Period IA. As previously indicated the presence of metal objects in this period decreased markedly. The decorative motifs become extremely restricted and there was an increasing trend towards repetition. In the early part of Period II, the tendencies towards a more restrictive repertoire observed in Period IB are firmly established. Though the number of types in the typological complex is on par with that of Period IA and IB, the actual grave assemblages become very repetitive. This is reflected in the decorative motifs which are dominated by design elements Dl ? a series of ribs and D5 ? band of grooves. The marked absence of ornaments or miscellaneous items that characterized Period IA graves attests to the restrictive nature of the typological complex of Period II. All periods at Butkara II witness a change in the categories of pots that are included in the grave assemblages. In Period I A, the majority of types fall into two categories. Bowls-on-Stands and Bottles. The large number of jars present in this period may be accounted for by the fact that VTf68 was used as the cinerary urn. VTf68 with decorative motifs D70, D71 and D72 is the only form of pottery significantly related to the rite of cremation. These 'eye-bearing urns' where all reference to the human figure is limited to the eyes, were made specifically for the mortuary context (Stacul 1971: 11). In Period IB, Bottles and Bowls-on-Stands are still the most prevalent forms of pottery. In this period there is a marked increase in the occurrence of Vessels with Out-turned Rim. Biconical vessels make their first appearance. It was interesting to note that Bell-shaped vessels are restricted only to this period. The introduction of a new shape in pottery must reflect in part, a new method of doing things, such as the adoption of a new method of food production. The decrease in the number of jars may be explained by the transition from cremation to inhumation burials. The transition to Period II witnesses a marked decrease in the use of Bottles, with an increase in the production of Bowls-on-Stands, Biconical Vessels and Vessels with Out-turned Rim. There are also marked increases in other types of pottery such as miniature vases and Vessels with Deep Body. It is the marked increase in Vessels with Out-turned Rims that is of particular interest. If the pottery in the graves in this period were also used in the domestic context, [21] 61</page><page sequence="22">then what is the catalyst for the move in production away from Bottles to Vessels with Out-turned Rim? In discussing the transition noted in the mortuary complex of Period IA to that of Period II, the problem of causality must be considered. The question of causality hinges on whether the changes can be attributed to internal or external causes. Stacul (1970: 100) attributes the change from the Grey Thin-sided Ware of Period IA and IB to the Red Thin-sided Ware of Period II, to external causes, such as the intrusion of tribal groups of a northern extraction. The intrusion of a new people into the Swat Valley warrants some consideration. In Period VI of the Swat Valley sequence, the mortuary complex at Butkara II attests to a wide range of pottery types and the probable co-existence of the rite of inhumation and cremation. At the beginning of Period VII at Butkara II, Red Thin-sided Ware is gradually introduced into the grave assemblages and cremation is replaced by inhumation. By the end of Period VII, inhumation burials accompanied by assemblages of Red Thin-sided Ware is the norm. The change in the repertoire and fabric of the 'pottery, may be explained by a change in the production and trading relations of the communities settled in the Swat Valley in the protohistoric period. In Period VI, if the communities buried at Loebanr I, Katelai I and Butkara II were trading in ceramics, one or two of the villages may have been pottery producers and the other pottery consumers, then it would be expected that the repertoire of probable grave-goods would be quite large. This may explain the diversity of the decorative motifs that share only one or two elements in common at Butkara II in Period IA. As the grave repertoire is not limited to ceramics made by the household potters, it may account for the sheer diversity in numbers where several types of ceramics are single occurrences. This argument is given further support by the fact that previous authors have remarked on the 'absolute uniformity' of the material from Loebanr I, Katelai I and Butkara II (Silvi Antonini 1969; Stacul 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1975; Salvatori 1975: 334). Towards the end of Period IB, Red Thin-sided Ware is gradually introduced and Grey Thin-sided Ware begins to disappear. The ceramics characteristic of Period IA and IB disappear to be replaced by the typological complex of Period II. If this change in the typological complex can be attributed to an intrusion of tribal groups of a northern extraction, then it was a gradual process, where the pottery-producing communities adopted a foreign group of ceramic practices, and combined these with local elements. The introduction of a new ceramic style, may have originally been restricted to the production of a limited range of types and decorative motifs, as new ceramic practices were learned by potters. As demand and access to these new types of ceramics increased, the pottery became more prevalent in the mortuary context and replaced the types of previous periods. The introduction and short-lived occurrence of Biconical vessels and Bell-shaped vessels in Period IB, may indicate the presence of a different food preparation technique, which was soon replaced, or the use of domestic pottery previously restricted to settlement use. The restricted repertoire of pottery types 62 [22]</page><page sequence="23">and decorative motifs in Period II, may in fact reflect the limited number of graves excavated. The adoption of new ceramic practices and techniques by the pottery-producing communities, and the integration of a new people with the existing population, may have resulted in a gradual change in ritual beliefs and practices in the mortuary complex, though it is important to note that the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities remained the major social discriminator emphasizing continuity. The chronology of the three graveyards of Butkara II, Loebanr I and Katelai I, attest to the introduction of Red Thin-sided Ware, which supports the hypothesis that the pottery-producing communities adopted new practices and combined these with local elements. The question arises as to whether the integration of the northern tribal groups into the communities inhabiting the Swat Valley, was a gradual process of assimilation, or the sudden intrusion of an invading people. Stacul (1970: 100-101) suggests that the northern tribal groups attested to in the graveyards of the Swat Valley in Period VII, structurally resemble the nomadic and semi-nomadic groups of shepherd warriors that settled in Iran in the Iron Age Period III. This is suggested by the 'graves of warriors, whose arms mainly consist of spear points and leaf-shaped arrow heads; burial of horses; prevalence amongst the pottery of flasks and bottles' (Stacul 1970: 99-100). As previously indicated there is no evidence in the graves of Period II to indicate the burials of warriors, especially as metal objects are very rare. There is an isolated occurrence of a spear shaft and spear-head. The scarcity of metal objects and weapons in the graves may indicate that they were recycled by the living. The burial of horses within the formal area of the graveyard is attested to at Katelai where there are two such burials. There are no known horse burials at Butkara II. As previously indicated in the analysis of categories of types, there is a marked decrease in Period II in the production of bottles where they account for only 5.6% of the mortuary assemblage. Traumatic lesions in two skulls examined by Alciati &amp; Fedeli (1965: 173) which appear to have been caused by a stone from a catapult and a projectile point such as an arrow, may indicate that there was conflict between tribal groups settled in the valley, or simply that there were accidents. The material evidence in Period II at Butkara II, does not support the forceful intrusion of tribal groups of a northern extraction into the Swat valley, but does suggest the gradual adoption of new ceramic practices, which may indicate the gradual integration of foreign peoples into the communities settled in the valley. The Period II evidence from Butkara II cannot confirm Stacul's (1970: 100) hypothesis of the intrusion of northern groups of semi-nomadic shepherd warriors. It must be remembered that the Butkara II sample is very limited and may not be representative of the overall burial practices at Butkara II in this period. The differences in the typological complexes between Period IA-IB and Period II, does seem to support the possibility that there was some form of upheaval in the area and may indicate the presence of new tribal groups that were integrated into the existing population. [23] 63</page><page sequence="24">A second hypothesis that deserves serious consideration is that of internal causation. A change in the repertoire of types and clay, especially colour, may indicate changes in agricultural practices, the preparation of food, innovation and aesthetics. It is important to remember that nature determines the kinds of clay available for the potter's use, and that the Swat Valley has a long tradition of Red Ware production dating from Period II of the Ghaligai sequence. In the graveyards of Katelai I, Loebanr I and Butkara II, the presence of Red Thick-sided Ware attests to the production of Red Ware by the pottery-producing communities. A gradual transition from Red Thick-sided Ware to Red Thin-sided Ware is not hard to imagine, especially when the same transition can be traced in the Grey Ware. The refinement of pottery techniques in the production of Red Thin-sided Ware, may simply reflect an internal development. This would suggest that the colour of the pottery may be indicative of aesthetics and innovation and represent a cyclical fashion in the production of pottery. The introduction of new shapes indicates in part, a new way of doing things, such as food preparation. The development of new types may simply reflect changing agricultural practices, and simple innovation and adoption of new styles by pottery producing communities. The mortuary complex is an integral part of the socio-cultural system of the community and reflects the adaptive priorities and necessities of the community at large. Research on the internal changes in pottery production at Loebanr I and Katelai I and the settlement sites, will hopefully in the future shed further light on this problem. The statistical analysis of the material from Butkara II, has emphasized the need to examine the relationships of the various treatment accorded the dead within their specific context. By understanding the internal dynamics of the development of the mortuary complexes at Butkara II, Loebanr I and Katelai I, and then by comparing the results, it will be possible to understand the ways in which the communities settled in the Swat Valley in the protohistoric period, manipulated the mortuary complex to structure their relations. The mortuary complex is an integral part of the 'total cultural system' and reflects the socio-economic and political changes in the living community. By examining the differences in the internal dynamics of the graveyards, it will be possible to draw a more representative idea of the relationships of the various communities settled in the Swat Valley. The Butkara II material has indicated that the material from the graveyards cannot be treated in a unitary manner, if the aim of the analysis is more than the development of a relative chronology based on pottery typologies. The wealth of social information gleaned from the material at Butkara II, indicates a basic social continuity in the population, in that the dimensions of the upper and lower cavities are the major social discriminator in all periods. The changes in burial rite and the grave assemblages may reflect internal development and a cyclical fashion in the production of pottery, or may in fact signal the integration of a new people into the existing community. The small number of graves from Butkara II does not allow the confirmation of either hypothesis. Further examination and analysis of the material from the graveyards of Loebanr I and Katelai I will help to resolve this problem. 64 [24]</page><page sequence="25">REFERENCES Alciati, G.
