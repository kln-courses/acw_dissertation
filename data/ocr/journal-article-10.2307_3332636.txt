<plain_text><page sequence="1">Creativity as a Maturation of Symbolic Play Speculation about the relationship between artistic creativity in children and in adult artists has led some researchers to assume that artistic creativ- ity is at its peak in childhood. This romanticized view of childhood has been advocated by some contemporary researchers, including those of Harvard University's Project Zero.1 This paper presents an alternative view which suggests that artistic creativity matures with age. The scientific resolution of this controversy would require the objective measurement of creative behavior among the different age groups with a standardized measurement instrument. Until such empirical research is available, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn. In the meanwhile, how- ever, art educators and practicing artists confront this problem in the present. The question arises of how one can operate intelligently during the thirty or forty years until the necessary concrete data are obtained. Clarifying theoretical positions and assessing their logical consistency may help the art educator and practicing artist to develop a better perspec- tive on the problem. In this paper a theory of creativity as the maturation of symbolic play will be presented, and preliminary research with a testing instrument will be discussed. The theory of creativity as a maturation of symbolic play was codevel- oped by an artist and a psychologist.2 This perspective is unified by our mutual interest in the role of analogical thought in creativity. The theory we are presenting considers analogical thinking to be an important compo- nent of adult creativity that originates in children's symbolic play and reaches its mature form in the adult. We anticipate that the cognitive processes which operate in artistic cre- ativity can be generalized to other forms of creativity. Analogical thought, for instance, has been recognized as an important feature in the creation of scientific theories.3 A developmental relationship between children's play, imagination, and adult creativity has been suggested by many psychologists. Usually</page><page sequence="2">114 Commentaries one particular aspect of children's play is singled out as the forerunner of adult creativity.4 Although we are focusing on the role of analogical thought in creativity, we are not disregarding the importance of other aspects of children's play. Symbolic play refers to children's make-believe play, during which one thing is used to represent another. Symbolic play involves many behaviors, such as analogical thinking and exploratory acti- vities, that may mature in adult creativity. While visual analogies have been used as semiotic devices by artists in the contemporary era and throughout history, the ability of the artist to perceive and manipulate visual analogies is often overlooked in studies of artistic creativity.5 Moreover, a precise vocabulary for discussing these vis- ual analogies has been lacking. In order to clarify this concept, the artist coauthor of this paper has adopted the term isomorphism to refer to the aspect of resemblance which is perceived between two otherwise dissimilar things. Within the general category of isomorphism, further subcategories of resemblance can be identified. Examples of these would include resem- blances of form, such as homologs (a bat's wing is a homolog of the human arm); resemblances of function, such as analogs (the tail of a dolphin is analogous to the legs of a man); and other more coincidental resemblances, such as the resemblance between the branches of a tree and the bones of a human hand. Within the context of the visual arts, isomorphisms may be used as a means of implying a relationship between seemingly unrelated things. Iso- morphisms may also be used as a vehicle through which the artist is able to allude to something not directly present in a work, thereby allowing an image to acquire multiple levels of interpretation. The role of isomorphisms in the visual arts may be thought of as similar to the role of metaphor in literary composition. There are, however, two important distinctions which preclude the simple substitution of the word metaphor for the term isomorphism. First, metaphor is defined as a "fig- ure of speech" in which one thing is likened to another. Given this defini- tion, it is inappropriate to refer to a perceived resemblance between two things as a metaphor. Second, and more importantly, in a metaphor one thing is called by the name of something else. While anything may be called by another name, this alone does not guarantee that the resulting association will be a meaningful one. Use of the term isomorphism implies that there is something more than an arbitrary association present in the comparison. In the literature on metaphor an assumption is often made that the linguistic act precedes the perception of resemblances.6 For example, one calls the road a "ribbon of moonlight" and then perceives the visual resem- blance. We are suggesting instead that the visual resemblance is perceived before the metaphor is stated and that the ability to perceive resemblances underlies the ability to generate rich and appropriate metaphors. The selection of historical examples which follow illustrate the use of isomorphisms by visual artists.</page><page sequence="3">Commentaries 115 1. Baboon and Young, by Pablo Picasso, 1951. The artist's use of a baboon's face to reveal the anthropomorphic features of the toy car is both ironic and deeply suggestive. 2. The Isenheim Altarpiece, by Matthias Grfinewald, c. 1510-15. In this large, complex work, painted by Grfinewald for the mo- nastic hospital order of Saint Anthony of Isenheim, a functional isomorphism occurs. "One of the main illnesses treated at the hos- pital was ergotism (called St. Anthony's Fire) . . . its symptoms- convulsions and gangrene-were well known. The gangrene often compelled amputation, and it has been noted in this connection that the two moveable halves of the predella of the altarpiece, if slid apart, would make it appear that the legs of the body of Christ had been amputated. The same observation can be made of the two main panels. Because of the off-center placement of the cross, the opening of the left panel would 'sever' one arm from the crucified figure."' This symbolism may have been suggested in part by Grfinewald's patrons to evoke in the hospital's patients an empathic response to Christ's sufferings. 3. Death in a Tree (from the Frogner Fountain, Oslo), by Gustav Vigeland, c. 1908. The isomorphism involved here is the resemblance of form be- tween the tree's gnarled branches and the skeletonlike figure of Death concealed within the tree. As George Heard Hamilton ob- served, "Vigeland's allegories are not easy to decipher, and are best summarized as a statement of the doubt, disillusion, and physical decline that beset humanity on its passage through this world."8 4. The Haywain (center panel of a triptych), by Hieronymus Bosch, c. 1500. According to Walter S. Gibson, in the Haywain, "Bosch focuses on one of the Deadly Sins: the desire for worldly gain, or Avarice. ..."9 The central image is a wagon of hay which represents the riches of this world. In this work, the resemblance between the color of hay and the color of gold provides the isomorphism. Around the wagon swarm a crowd of peasants, each of whom is attempting to grab handfuls of hay from the wagon, while others are crushed beneath its wheels. None of the participants seem to realize that the object of their frenzied efforts is a load of com- mon hay. Many theorists assume that creativity is an unconscious process and that the types of analogical manipulations illustrated in these examples are not conscious manipulations.10 Based on our observations of other artists and our own experiences in creating art, it is evident that some artists have a conscious ability to perceive and manipulate isomorphisms. The first manifestation of analogical thought appears in the symbolic play of children. For example, children will use a broom as a horse or mimic a pistol with their fingers. The ability to perceive and manipulate</page><page sequence="4">116 Commentaries isomorphisms may be a necessary componenet of creative imagination, which children and adult artists seem to share and which often appears to be undeveloped in the average adult. The adult artist differs from the child, however, in the degree to which analogical thinking is under conscious control and also in the adult artist's ability to alternate between analogical and logical modes of thinking. This is why we refer to creativity as a mat- uration of symbolic play. Freud regarded analogical thinking as a component of the unconscious primary-process thought. We are suggesting that analogical thinking is re- pressed along with primary-process thought during middle childhood. Dur- ing the preschool years, analogical thinking is socially acceptable as a com- ponent of children's symbolic play. However, as children enter formal schooling, they are expected to conform to conventional symbol usage and to acquire logical thought processes. In many adults, primary-process thought is repressed in the unconscious, where it continues to function in dreaming. Analogical thinking and exploratory impulses are repressed along with primary-process thought.' 1 The amount of repression varies among individuals, some continuing to develop analogical thinking on a conscious level while acquiring logical thought processes. An equilibrium between logical and analogical thought processes might be achieved in adulthood. Those individuals who maintain a conscious de- velopment of analogical thought processes would achieve more control over these processes and, consequently, be capable of generating more iso- morphic imagery and metaphors. Such individuals would not have to re- gress to a childlike state in order to be creative. This stage of collaboration between logical and nonlogical thought processes represents a fifth stage of cognitive development when placed within the context of Piagetian theory. Three other versions of a fifth Piagetian stage have been suggested: Klaus Riegel's Dialectic Stage, Arlin's Problem-Finding Stage, and Commons and Richards's Structural Analytic Stage.1 2 Although each of these three theories addresses an important aspect of adult cognition, they do not address the collaboration between logical and nonlogical processes. The nonlogical processes to which we re- fer include analogical thinking as well as dialectical thought and explora- tory problem finding. Through the interaction of logical and nonlogical processes, the paradigmatic structures to which Commons and Richards refer may also be synthesized. We have developed a creativity test which can measure isomorphic manipulations and which can be used by subjects over two years of age. The test consists of eight geometric shapes: large and small circles, half-cir- cles, squares, and triangles. The plastic shapes are thick enough to allow them to be stood on edge, but not so thick as to make it seem as if this is their preferred position. Initially, subjects were asked to make something using these shapes, and then were asked to make as many different things as possible. Several different aspects of behavior can be studied using this test. Techniques for measuring creativity, the ability to generate isomor- phisms, exploratory activity, playfulness, and aesthetic aptitude are under</page><page sequence="5">Commentaries 117 consideration. In a preliminary study, a procedure for measuring creativity as diver- gent behavior was developed, and two aspects of divergent thinking, flu- ency and flexibility, were measured. Fluency was the number of items made, and flexibility was the number of different types of arrangements produced using the shapes. Forty-six subjects between the ages of 2 and 57 years were tested. The sessions were videotaped, and the first 20 minutes of each session were scored. The highest scores on both fluency and flexibility were obtained by adult artists. Among the six highest scores on each measure were five adults and one child. The adults with these high scores were between 20 and 40 years of age and included 3 artists and 4 nonartists, all of whom had completed at least 2 years of college. Both of the children who scored within the 6 highest scores were 6 years of age. When the results were graphed for age and fluency and age and flexibility, a J-shaped pattern appeared, with a small peak at age 6 and a higher peak in the 20s. This preliminary study demonstrates that this standardized creativity test can be administered to subjects aged 2 years and over. As more sub- jects are tested, it is anticipated that the age-related trends indicated in this study will be verified. For the moment, however, it is apparent that our hypothesis that artistic creativity increases with age deserves serious con- sideration. In his writings, Howard Gardner of the Harvard University Project Zero research group has suggested a U-shaped model for artistic development. According to his model, artistic creativity peaks between the ages of 5 and 7, diminishes during the ages 7 to 11, and then increases again in adoles- cence.13 Since Project Zero did not actually study average adults or adult artists, it is premature to conclude that the highest level of artistic creativ- ity is the level set by the five- to seven-year-olds. The possibility exists that adult artistic development can surpass that of the five- to seven-year-old, resulting in a J-shaped pattern of artistic development. Larry W. Smolucha and Francine C. Smolucha Shimer College, Illinois, and Moraine Valley Community College, Illinois NOTES 1. In The Arts and Human Development, Howard Gardner states, "Clearly there are important differences in skill, acquaintance with the artistic tradition, sen- sitivity to nuance between the child and the adult participants in the artistic process. But a more fundamental question for the psychologist is whether the schoolchild must pass through further qualitatively different stages in order to become an artist (as it has been argued that he must pass through qualitatively different stages en route to becoming a practicing scientist). On this question I have arrived at an unexpected conclusion: the child of 7 or 8 has, in most re- spects, become a participant in the artistic process and he need not pass through any further qualitative reorganizations" (New York: Wiley, 1982).</page><page sequence="6">118 Commentaries 2.

Project Zero's comparison of children's drawings with the work of adult artists overlooked the use of visual analogy (isomorphisms) as a semiotic device in art. An example is the discussion of Picasso's Guernica in Howard Gardner, Artful Scribbles (New York: Basic Books, 1980), p. 268. This is consistent with their omission of three of Nelson Goodman's criteria when discussing visual art. The three omitted criteria are semantic density, syntactic density, and multiple and complex reference; they could be used to describe the use of visual analogies as symbols with multiple meanings in visual art.
