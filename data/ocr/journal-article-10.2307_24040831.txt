<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Glimpses" in Wordsworth's "The World is Too Much With Us" By David Ketterer Concordia University Wordsworth's central statement in "The world is too much with us" is not especially controversial. He is clearly not playing Christianity off against paganism. Rather he is claiming that, given the contemporary, supposedly "Christian" worship of the Mammon of materialism, the alternative extreme, the pagan adoration of natural elements in the form of anthropomorphic gods, is preferable. Indeed, by comparison his contemporaries are more truly pagan. Less obvious, and the subject of this note, is the process of rebirth, which Wordsworth suggests throughout the sonnet, culminating in the vision of the Greek sea-gods, Proteus and Triton. Proteus and Triton are introduced as the product of an implied meta morphosis within the semipersonalized heaving sea and the semivisualized winds "up-gathered now like sleeping flowers," respectively. 1 Close attention, however, to the associations present in the relevant passage will reveal that Wordsworth sees Proteus "rising from the sea" and Triton with "his wreathed horn" as actually born of a union between the sea and the inspiring winds, a union whereby the translation is effected: We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! This sea that bares her bosom to the moon; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers. That Wordsworth's mercenaries should give anything away is surprising but the line is doubly ironic in that, granted a romantic context, to give one's heart away is often an admirable thing. Once suggested, such a romantic context ex plains the next three lines. We are witnessing a love scene or the aftermath of one. The "howling" to come is suggestive of labor and the now "sleeping flower" (and the incomplete syntactical construction) of imprisoned potential or the possibility of birth. Proteus and Triton emerge as brothers, a situa tion that is mythologically correct since they are both sons of Poseidon (Neptune) and Amphitrite. The relationship between the sea and the winds and Proteus and Triton is paralleled by a relationship between the sea and Wordsworth as is implied by the connection between the line, "This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon," and Wordsworth's cry, "I'd rather be/ A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn." The term "suckled," as opposed to the possible but more specific terms, "tutored" or "brought up," indicates Wordsworth's belief that it is nature as represented by the sea which has nurtured his new awareness. Consequently the relationship between the sea and Wordsworth is that of mother and son. If we superimpose the two genealogies identified above as follows, sea (Wordsworth/Proteus) = winds (Triton), it is inevitable that we equate Words worth with Proteus as offspring of a common parent. Any further doubt or con fusion about the "legitimacy" of such an issue may be resolved by indicating the "strawberry birthmark." Among Proteus's accomplishments is the ability to see into the future, to obtain visionary glimpses beyond the ken of mortal men engaged in "getting and spending." Wordsworth has similar glimpses, "glimpses 122</page><page sequence="2">that would make me less forlorn," as he puts it. And our glimpses at the parallel rebirth in nature and Wordsworth provides "proof" of the claim in "Tintera Abbey" that "the mighty world/ of eye, and ear" is composed "both of what they half create,/ And what perceive." NOTE Quotations from "The world is too much with us" are as they appear in Poetical Works, ed. E. de Selincourt and H. Darbishire (1946), III, 18 19. In their "Notes" on p. 424, de Selincourt and Darbishire point out that the phraseology concerning Proteus and Triton is apparently indebted to " Paradise Lost, III, 603-4" and " Colin Clout ' s come home again, 11. 244-45." This discovery does not, of course, explain why Wordsworth chose Proteus and Triton, in particular. JL â€žU JU .A. JU</page></plain_text>
