"T~ o evoke the body and technology together is immedi- ately to ask what kinds of conjunctions connect them. For Anne Balsamo in Technologies of the Gendered Body, the important point is that the material and discursive be brought together. She emphasizes a gendered body "that has always been not simply material (i.e., natural) but rather a hybrid construction of materiality and discourse" (12). The topics she dis- cusses, including body building, cosmetic surgery, and in vitro preg- nancy, would seem to emphasize the body as material object. Yet when push comes to shove, both push and shove are interpreted as discursive signifiers rather than material actions in the world. It would be unfair to treat this problem as if it were unique to Balsamo, for it is symptomatic of the divide that continues to separate scien- tific and technological disciplines on the one hand, which report their findings in the language of naive realism, and cultural and literary studies on the other, where discursive approaches are the order of the day. How to make material and rhetorical approaches work together remains one of the important problems facing con- Contemporary Literature XXXVIII, 4 0010-7484/97/0004-755 $1.50 ? 1997 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">756 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE temporary cultural studies of science and technology. That Balsamo does not entirely succeed in co-joining them is perhaps less impor- tant than that she clearly articulates the necessity for doing so. More successful is the other major thrust of her project: how cultural codes of gender intersect with technologies of the body to produce techno-discursive objects that replicate traditional gender patterns of masculinity and femininity. With consistently good sense and elegant prose, Balsamo persuasively demonstrates that although the technologies may be cutting edge, the gender codes they instan- tiate are all too familiar. Balsamo's chapters on bodybuilding and cosmetic surgery illus- trate the strengths and limitations of her approach. She reads the film Pumping Iron II as a contest between different styles of feminin- ity, contrasting the masculinized body of Bev Francis with the more feminine, rounded body of Rachel McLish to show "the artificiality of attributes of 'natural' gender identity and the malleability of cul- tural ideals of gender identity" (55). When the winner turns out to be neither of these contenders but the African American Carla Dun- lap, the film's narrator who interprets other women's bodies but is barely recognized as a contender herself, Balsamo sees in the era- sure of McLish's competitiveness the "persistence with which gen- der and race hierarchies structure technological practices, thereby limiting the disruptive possibilities of technological transgressions" (55). Reading the body as sign, Balsamo has little discussion of the histories of the technologies or analyses of how these histories inter- sect with signifying systems to produce material-discursive objects. A similar method informs the chapter on cosmetic surgery, where again the emphasis falls more on the legible nature of the signifying bodies than on the technologies that help to make them so. Because this side of the story is not told, the insistence that analysis must concentrate on both the material and discursive remains a rhetorical gesture rather than a realized methodology. Nonetheless, even the rhetorical gesture is useful, for it stresses the importance of such a synthesis. Among the most interesting chapters are those on virtual tech- nologies. In "The Virtual Body in Cyberspace," Balsamo notices the strange blend of countercultural rhetoric and promotion of elitist technologies in Mondo 2000, arguing that it functions as a virtual</page><page sequence="3">H A Y L E S * 757 handbook illustrating the process whereby "technologies are trans- formed into technological commodities" (122). Rightly skeptical of claims that cyberspace erases markers of gender, she suggests that "what these VR encounters really provide is an illusion of control over reality, nature, and especially over the unruly, gender- and race-marked, essentially mortal body" (127). Here more than else- where, she succeeds in joining the discursive to the material as she focuses on the physical effects of virtual reality technology. This leads to the central insight that "visualization technologies no longer simply mimic or represent reality-they virtually recreate it" (125). "Feminism for the Incurably Informed" opens with what has to be one of the great lines of contemporary criticism: "My mother was a computer, but she never learned to drive." The sentence connects the material circumstances of working women (called computers), who were employed in pre-electronic days to operate mechanical calculators, with the differently situated but still material bodies that currently perform the labor effaced by electronic technology. From this platform, Balsamo launches a reading of Pat Cadigan's cyberpunk novel Synners. Her reading argues for a gender-encoded difference between male characters who use the technology to es- cape corporeality and female characters who concentrate on inte- grating the technology with their bodies rather than leaving them behind. Although this conclusion is scarcely revolutionary, it is sol- idly documented and convincingly argued. In this chapter, and in- deed in most of the book, the nuanced quality of Balsamo's observa- tions and her careful assessments of complex situations made me feel that here was an authorial voice that I could trust. Readers who come to this book wanting to learn about the cultural and gender implications of contemporary technologies of the body may not be cured of the long-standing dualism separating the material and dis- cursive, but they will certainly be informed (whether incurably or not). By contrast, the essay collection edited by Ira Livingston and Ju- dith Halberstam, Posthuman Bodies, is highly variable in quality. In places it is so polemical that I would trust these authorial voices about as much as I would a salesman selling insurance for alien abduction. Indeed, to hear these folks tell it, we don't need to go to</page><page sequence="4">758 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Roswell to encounter aliens; we have plenty of aliens right here at home, starting with ourselves. Setting an irreverent tone for the volume, the editors' introduction is a frustrating mixture of insights that hit the mark and statements so poorly aimed that they couldn't hit the L.A. Convention Center on a clear day, never mind in the smog. Their approach reminds me of a piece of graffiti I saw scrawled on the pedestrian underpass at the University of Iowa. Evidently tired of such discriminating slogans as "U.S. Out of Bosnia," this tagger simply sprayed, "U.S. Out of Everywhere." Here's a sample of their iconoclastic, devil-take-the-hindmost rheto- ric: "The human tribe can never again be family. Postfamilial bodies celebrate the end of His-and-Her matching theories that endlessly revolve around the miserable imagined unit, the imagined comm- unity of an imagined kinship in an imagined house with an imag- ined dog and two (if only) imagined children" (10). The post- humanities, they inform us, emerge "out of a disenchantment that is both anti-aesthetic and anti-scientific" (1). Their method is to de- fine the posthuman by declamation rather than by reference to his- torical processes. According to them, history itself has lost its mean- ing, evidently superseded by rhetorical fiat: "History is inefficient as a method of processing meaning; it cannot keep up. As history slows down relative to events in the realm of information and mean- ing, the future remains on hold" (3). What exactly are posthuman bodies? They are "the causes and effects of postmodern relations of power and pleasure, virtuality and reality, sex and its consequences" (3); they come out of subcul- tures, never culture, which in any case doesn't exist except as the subcultures it appropriates; they are fragmented multiplicities rather than unities; they mark a "solidarity between disenchanted liberal subjects and those who were always-already disenchanted, those who seek to betray identities that legitimize or de-legitimize them at too high a cost" (9). In short, they are almost anything that goes against the status quo, operating "beyond any therapy that attempts to rectify the disorder and illogic of desires with health, purity and stability" (13). Sounding as if it were written by Donna Haraway on speed, the prose echoes some of her positions but with- out her complex ironies and sense of responsibility, driven by a fre- netic desire to deconstruct everything, even its own previous state-</page><page sequence="5">HAYLES 759 ments. Most of all, this is writing that wants to proclaim it is on the cutting edge. Anyone who still thinks she is human is hopelessly behind the times, tainted by that most despised of emotions, nostal- gia, so it's no use even to think of objecting. "We have rehearsed the claim that the posthuman condition is upon us and that lingering nostalgia for a modernist or humanist philosophy of self and other, human and alien, normal and queer is merely the echo of a discur- sive battle that has already taken place-and the tinny futurism that often answers such nostalgia is the echo of an echo" (19). The weakest essays are those that take the editors at their word and replicate their casual approach toward rigor. A case in point is Steven Shaviro's "Two Lessons from Burroughs." The two lessons are that language is a virus-a complex proposition that Shaviro explains well, with apt examples from Burroughs-and a very slanted reading of Burroughs that uses a potted history of contem- porary biology to argue that it is better to have an insect neural system than a human one. Better by what criteria, you ask? Better in its capacity for unexpected evolution and species variation, thus making it the biological equivalent to the desire to jettison the past so evident in the introduction. Shaviro argues that since our "mam- malian talents for memory and self-reflection serve largely to op- press us with the dead weight of the past" (49), it is better to opt for a neural system based on "[s]egmented repetition with modular varia- tion," which "allows for a far greater explosion of change, multiplic- ity, and sheer exuberant waste than traditional organicist models of production and circulation ever did" (50). Like the editors, Shaviro is anxious to proclaim that identity must be deconstructed, now phrased as a biological imperative. "These multiplicities never add up to anything like a distinct species identity" (50), he asserts-a claim that will be news to most entomologists I know. More satisfying, from both an aesthetic and intellectual view- point, are Kathy Acker's provocative excerpt from Pussy, King of the Pirates and Allucquere Rosanne Stone's "Identity in Oshkosh," an essay that also appears in her book The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age. In Stone's report of a trial of a man charged with raping a woman who has multiple personality disor- der, the editors' claim about posthuman multiplicity becomes a com- monsense acknowledgment that multiple personalities do exist</page><page sequence="6">760 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE and, in the role-playing environment of the Internet, must be con- sidered normal rather than pathological. Also astute are Kelly Hurley's essay on body horror and Eric White's piece on science fiction films, which make points similar to Shaviro's but in more convincing fashion. While acknowledging the value of psychoanalytic and ideological readings of horror films, Hurley points out that these interpretations recuperate horror back into the realm of the human by reading the monstrous body as repre- senting repressed aspects of the social corpus (a Marxist reading, for example, sees the alien as a projection of the alienated worker). By contrast, Hurley urges a reading of horror as "a genre without nostalgia, without investment in 'the human' as a discrete and sta- ble category" (221). Resisting the impulse to understand the alien by reference to the human, whether repressed or not, Hurley em- phasizes the genre's ability to "generate new imaginings (however terrifying) of the human/not-human, of the human-becoming- other" (209). In " 'Once They Were Men, Now They're Land Crabs': Monstrous Becomings in Evolutionist Cinema," White makes a simi- lar point when he argues that the films he examines explore "mon- strous becomings" that "can be understood to figure an evolutionist perspective on the human body as an assemblage of non-human parts" (244). Evolutionist cinema "renders the body monstrous," he continues, by "re-animating hitherto latent aspects of human na- ture, the genealogically prior forms of non-human life" (244). His careful readings of four science fiction films make a convincing case for the editors' claim that "You're not human until you're post- human. You were never human" (8). One of the most provocative and interesting essays in the collec- tion is Alexandra Chasin's "Class and Its Close Relations: Identities among Women, Servants, and Machines." Chasin points out that the servant is expected to efface his or her own labor behind such polite phrases as "It was a pleasure to serve you." Tracing a develop- ment in the names of ATM machines from the anthropomorphic ("Harvey Wallbanker") to the functional ("CompuCash") to service- oriented monikers ("CashFlow"), she suggests that electronic ma- chines are increasingly slotted into social and cultural roles previ- ously occupied by servants. Like servants, they are expected to efface their labor and present service as a pleasure. Through a per-</page><page sequence="7">H A Y L E S 761 ceptive analysis of television commercials featuring kitchen appli- ances, she convincingly demonstrates that together the screenic housewife and machine produce a performance that stabilizes "the idea that a service class of being(s) is proper and even necessary; hence, electronics participate in, and thereby reinforce, the unequal social and psychological dynamics upon which the myth of a con- stantly expanding middle class depends" (93). She concludes, "let us be mindful of the consequences of assuming that some being or other must serve to make it easier to live and to work" (93). If this means that treating machines as servants perpetuates an ideology of inequality, the point is well taken. After reading her concluding paragraphs several times, I am still uncertain whether she endorses the more radical conclusion that it is wrong to treat machines as servants because nothing, not even a machine, should be made to serve. Although the day may well be approaching when we will need seriously to debate the proposition that "human rights" should be extended to machines, much more would need to be said to convince me, at least, that this proposition should be endorsed. The impact of reproductive technologies is explored by Susan Squier in a compelling chapter examining the ectogenetic (extra- uterine) fetus, the surrogate mother, and the pregnant man. These representations have in common a separation of the fetus from the gestating mother, a configuration that Squier argues facilitates the interpellation of the subject into (post)industrial capitalism. In another compelling essay, Jennifer Terry looks at interviews con- ducted of gay people in the 1920s and 1930s who allowed them- selves to be constructed and probed as objects of scientific study. Asking "How could the subjects have said yes to science in this way?" (141), she turns the tables and uses the interviews to interro- gate science's relation to the homosexual subjects. In "Phantom and Reel Projections: Lesbians and the (Serial) Killing-Machine," Ca- milla Griggers interrogates the figure of the lesbian as a serial killer, which she perceptively argues represents an excess that allows the community to "represent to itself the normative 'health' of its every- day social relations" (172). In this sense the representation of the lesbian killer in popular media makes the woman into a scapegoat, while the real social pathologies of poverty, abuse, and dysfunc- tional families go unremarked.</page><page sequence="8">762 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE A final trio of essays are interested in using the posthuman to critique dominant ideologies. Paula Rabinowitz, in "Soft Fictions and Intimate Documents," explores the possibility of using the posthuman for feminist ends, seeing it as a silenced form of subjec- tivity that, if allowed to speak, might serve as a witness to social oppression. Roddey Reid uses the posthuman as a platform from which to launch a satiric critique of "family values," in the process providing useful historical contextualization of debates in the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries over family values. Finally, in one of the volume's less successful pieces, Carol Mason makes an over- the-top argument that links abortion with the lynching of black men and the complicity of white women in this practice. She focuses on the relation in Terminator 2 of Sarah Connor and Miles Dyson, the black man who develops the killing cybernetic intelligence, Skynet. Much of her argument hinges on a single line from the film, the moment when Dyson, realizing the raid on the Skynet labs may not work, yells "We have to abort." As if this weren't silly enough, she omits from her argument the fact that Connor and Dyson become allies after their initial confrontation. With such diversity of subject matter, not to mention intellectual quality, the reader may well finish Posthuman Bodies feeling more confused about what the posthuman means than when she began. It is no accident that the essays succeed best when their aims are modest and their methodology exploratory rather than polemical. Whatever the posthuman signifies, it will be brought into existence as a useful theoretical construct not by fiat, but by the painstaking research and careful documentation necessary to understand the full implications of the large-scale economic, technological, and cul- tural forces currently redefining the human. Even then, more than proclamation will be needed to fashion for posthuman bodies the liberatory potential this volume wants to see. University of California at Los Angeles</page></plain_text>
