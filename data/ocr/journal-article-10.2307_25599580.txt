<plain_text><page sequence="1">Potentiality in Prometheus Unbound D.J. HUGHES HAROLD BLOOM writes of the passages describing the chariot of the moon and the sphere of the earth in the fourth act, "These visions are the mythic culminations of Prometheus Unbound."1 Not all commentators would agree, but most have found these passages worthy of comment, Locock remarking that "the blank verse marks the highest level attained by Shelley."2 The Biblical and Miltonic sources and analogues of these passages have been studied by Wiltrude L. Smith3 and Ants Oras,4 the nature of the imagery by R. H. Fogle,5 while perhaps the best pages yet written on the thematic significance of these two visions remain those of G. Wilson Knight in The Starlit Dome,6 who reads these ex traordinary lines (180-318) against the background of the unfolding vision of the total poem. Without such sense of Prometheus as a whole, these passages, however brilliant and portentous in them selves, tend to appear more exotic than they are. And, while the ex amination of Ezekiel and Milton throws some light on how these passages came to be written, the fact remains that the tone of these visions differs widely from Biblical prophecy and the vengeful deity of Milton's chariot. Nothing in Shelley is more characteristic than these visions, and nothing in Shelley brings to better focus the par ticular and unusual strategies by which he created poems. These two visions in the celebrations of the fourth act of the drama are best read in relation to the poem as a whole and in relation to Shelley's charac teristic poetic method. This method, as it reveals itself in the most significant poems, is best understood on the analogy of the famous "fading coal" which i. Shelley's Mythmaking (New Haven, 1959), p. 140. 2.

HUGHES Shelley uses as a metaphor for the mind in creation.7 The parts of Shelley's longer poems can be understood as a series of such fading coals, sometimes beginning in full hypostasis, sometimes gathering strength and coherence as the self-discovering image perfects itself, sometimes starting in collapse and ending there, but, whatever the process, the imagistic progression is wholly organic and under some kind of overarching control, even when the particular passage seems to complete itself in a thematic or emotional (not formal) collapse. I think this process is everywhere at work in Prometheus Unbound, although the vast interwoven complexity of the poem makes it dif ficult to plot. Such a process is dramatic in a different sense than we normally think of the term, but much of the continuing argument about Prometheus as drama might be resolved if we thought of the drama enacted in the poem, not in the Aristotelian sense of character in action, but in the terms Shelley himself set for his poem (often quoted, but seldom understood), "imagery... drawn from the oper ations of the human mind."8 The poem contains two such large dra matic operations, i. the events leading to the unchaining of Prome theus, and 2. the building of another process by which Prometheus, in his symbolic role, can find a fresh hypostasis, not in the actuality which Shelley is anxious to spiritualize in the poem, but in the Poten tiality where the poem finally leaves us. Paul Valery speaks of the poet as cleansing the verbal situation.9 Shelley, in his most ambitious poem, can be seen as cleansing the ontological situation, restoring our sense of the potential, turning, through a series of verbal strategies, the actual back upon itself. The world at the end of the poem is a virtual one, with the seeds of decline checked, themselves remaining in potency. If this general statement about Prometheus Unboundhas any validity, each part of the poem must bear, microcosmically, some of the pat tern of the fading coal, a structure of coherence and collapse. The widest ranging structure in the poem, indeed in Shelley's poetry as a whole, is this section of Act iv describing the visions of the Oceanides. 7.

" (iv.316-318). These 138 lines present in small the process of the poem as a whole, a process which, here, save for the symbolic in fants themselves, dispenses with the important dramatis personae of the drama. The subsequent cosmic dance of the masculine earth and feminine moon has been prepared for by the fullest imaginative reach of the Shelleyan strategy. In Bloom's witty view, "In effect, the infants give away the mythic planets in marriage."10 The poten tial, then, arises out of the actual to new forms and dominates it. It is important to keep in mind that these visions occur in the fourth act, after the freeing of Prometheus. The "intoxication... the complicated and uncontrollable splendour" which C. S. Lewis finds in Act iv11 express not so much the liberation of suffering mankind from politi cal and psychological repression as from the ontological tyranny of the phenomenal, a task given to the very medium with which the poet works: Language is a perpetual Orphic song, Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng Of thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapeless were. (iv.415-417) I These visions begin in a characteristic Shelleyan absence, the memory of music fled: Panthea. Ha! they are gone! lone. Yet feel you no delight From the past sweetness? Panthea. As the bare green hill When some soft cloud vanishes into rain, Laughs with a thousand drops of sunny water To the unpavilioned sky! (iv.180-184) io. Bloom, p. 142. 11. Rehabilitations (London, 1939), p. 33</page><page sequence="4">110 D. J. HUGHES This "unpavilioning" is important here because the first three acts of the poem have succeeded in destroying the actuality with which the drama opens: Prometheus chained to his rock. Now, the structuring of further forms in the poem can take place in the ambience of liber ated man, who, himself, must be placed against the cosmic, supra human content of these visions for the poem to have its widest range. It should be noted, also, that the two visions have dramatic propriety: it is proper that the lesser of the Oceanides, lone, should, as Bloom points out,12 have the less terrific vision, a vision of a Potentiality which stays perfectly poised in itself, and that Panthea, the stronger, should be able to bear the larger experience, in which the potential of her vision, the earth-infant, should lead to the fullest actualization and collapse in Shelley?a collapse, of course, perfectly contained within the formal structure of the poem. The new music encountered by the Oceanides is heard "Kindling within the strings of the waved air | Aeolian modulations" (iv.187 188). Kindle is a highly significant word in Shelley, often signifying the beginning of the Shelleyan process, the awakening of the fading coal. The stasis expressed at the very beginning of these visions re calls and contrasts with the opening stasis of the poem. Compare: The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears Of their moon-freezing crystals, the bright chains Eat with their burning cold into my bones. (I.3I-33) Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening tones, Which pierce the sense, and live within the soul, As the sharp stars pierce winter's crystal air And gaze upon themselves within the sea. (iv.190-193) But this happy narcissism, usually signifying points of desired rest in Shelley's work, now gives way to movement as "Two visions of strange radiance" float into view above the runnels of a rivulet which, "like sisters | Who part with sighs that they may meet in smiles," can be identified with Panthea and lone themselves as they await their major revelations. In Ione's subsequent vision, the moon chariot is likened to "that thinnest boat, | In which the Mother of Months is borne | By ebbing light into her western cave" (iv.206 12. Bloom, p. 140.</page><page sequence="5">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 111 208). Many commentators have pointed to this image as a picture of the old moon in the new moon's arms,13 certainly a clear representa tion of the emergence of the potential from the actual, and the boat imagery, of course, is very familiar in Shelley,14 best illuminated here, perhaps, by a passage in a letter to Peacock: "rivers are not like roads, the work of the hands of man; they imitate mind, which wan ders at will over pathless deserts, and flow through nature's loveliest recesses, which are inaccessible to anything besides."15 The mind that rivers imitate is general or collective mind; the boat is the vehicle or container of the individual mind or consciousness which enables us to participate in, without being overwhelmed by, the Universal. More over, the boat-image often arises in Shelley's work from the struc tural need to keep his poem moving. In this passage, the boat as imi tative of thought in the manner suggested, and the boat as a technical device to stir the poem to movement, combine to inaugurate the great visions of Act iv. We should also keep in mind that the boat image has a female significance in these lines. The moon, which will finally be fully hypostatized as female and impregnated by the earth, is seen at this point in the poem in its fragile beginnings?the thinnest boat. The movement of Ione's vision must be distinguished, how ever, from the wild Shelleyan journeys ofAlastor, Epipsychidion, and The Witch of Atlas?and even from Asia's ride at the end of Act 11 of Prometheus. Here Shelley manages to suggest movement within stasis, a "progress" that, paradoxically, creates an image of stillness. The mingling of the solid and the vaporous, which Fogle and others have noticed as characteristic of Shelley's technique, not only enables him to grasp the very difficult material he is dealing with, but helps him to express here, as nowhere else in his work, his sense of the potential of thought as it seeks its form. The infant asleep in the moon-chariot symbolizes the perfection of the potential, a potential 13. Both Mr. Bloom and Mr. Richard Harter Fogle seem to me to misread this passage slightly. Bloom speaks of "the new moon in the old moon's arms" when the image is meant to be the opposite, I think, as in Coleridge and elsewhere. The se quence is important for the development of Shelley's imagery of this passage. And Mr. Fogle, using the less acceptable reading of night for light in "By ebbing night into her western cave," distorts the time sequence of the passage. 14. Perhaps the best discussion of Shelley's boat imagery can be found in Neville Rogers, Shelley at Work (Oxford, 1956), pp. 91-105. 15. From a letter to Peacock, July 17, 1816.

The six repetitions of white in as many lines (iv.219-224) emphasize this magnificently unresolved possibility?the condition of being before the "staining" process of existence takes over, as the famous lines in Adonais describe the condition of human life. The infant, however, stands for more than this. Harold Bloom's identification of this figure with the Divine Man of Ezekiel does not seem very useful, but Wilson Knight comes closer, I think, to the full significance of the infant figures in this act. He writes (of the second infant, but I think his remarks are applicable to both): "Here the ac tive and central agent is again the Child, the Earth-Spirit, yet son of man. Shelley is to this extent a humanist: the child is the final fact."16 This "final fact," of course, cuts deep through English Romanticism, whether we think of the child in terms of Blakean Innocence or of the Wordsworthian prophet-blest. But there are important distinc tions to be made between the two infants of Shelley's vision. The first, the infant in the moon-chariot, is akin to Blake's Thel and the chariot is to be associated with the state of Beulah. The second, the infant of the earth-sphere, is more the Child of Apocalypse and the vision of the higher innocence. The infant of the moon-chariot stays prematurely in the potential, and the Shelleyan process cannot com plete itself. The solid clouds of the chariot's wheels "as they roll | Over the grass, and flowers, and waves, wake sounds, | Sweet as a singing rain of silver dew" (iv.233-235). This is not the "deep music of the rolling world" heard by Panthea in line 186, but is more like the "under-notes" caught by lone in line 189. We still need the full, self-destroying cosmic music. Panthea's remarkable vision of the sphere of the earth sets the poetic process going to its inevitable completion. This sphere which, among a dozen other possibilities, can be taken as a description of Shelley's poetry at its best, "Solid as crystal, yet through all its mass | Flow, as through empty space, music and light" (iv.23 9-240), offers us the full world the moon-chariot was not capable of kindling. Color is awakened: "Purple and azure, white, and green, and golden, |" and sufficient plenitude expressed in one of Shelley's most daring conceits, "and every space between | Peopled with unimaginable shapes, | Such as ghosts dream dwell in the lampless deep, | Yet each 16. Knight, p. 222.</page><page sequence="7">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 113 inter-transpicuous." The combination here is so remote as to be hardly graspable, yet the syntax is firm and the language exact (inter transpicuous strikes me as incredibly cunning). Moreover, the move ment of this vision is one of a "self-destroying swiftness" (the true Shelleyan mode) which will ultimately end in the illumination of a cosmic cataclysm, capable of grinding and kneading the actual back into the potential: "With mighty whirl the multitudinous orb | Grinds the bright brook into an azure mist | Of elemental subtlety, like light." William Empson's criticism of these lines, that Shelley "not being able to think of a comparison fast enough . . . compares the thing to a vaguer or more abstract notion of itself, or points out that it is its own nature, or that it sustains itself by supporting itself,"17 is an accurate description of Shelley's technique, but his implication that this is somehow inadequate misapprehends the function of Shel ley's mode. These materials are notoriously elusive, whether they are emerging into full realization or again passing from realization into a new potential, but this is precisely the area Shelley wishes to grasp: his whole poem centers there. The same technique can be seen at work in the description of the sleeping infant in the sphere who is likened to "a child o'erwearied with sweet toil." The child is a demi urge who has done work and must do more; he is the child of the higher innocence who must illuminate and then transcend the natural processes of experience. The progress of this orb, leading as it must to the inevitable Shel leyan collapse, disturbs lone, who, in her ironic comment at line 269, attempts to slow the terrific movement, as she interprets the smiles of the sleeping child, " 'Tis only mocking the orb's harmony." Bloom18 and Knight19 have commented well on this line, emphasizing its hu manistic irony, the necessity for the human to intrude itself at this point lest the orb turn into something like the crushing chariot of The Triumph of Life. I would like to see the function of this line in relation to Shelley's evolving form. Ione's vision of the moon-chariot was read as a premature suspension, a stasis that failed to complete Shelley's form. The deeper music of Panthea's vision of the earth sphere, with its powerful grinding and kneading, the grinding of the bright brook of the actual into the mist which is the new potential, 17.

Blackmur's Yeatsian verse, "Keep the great gong go ing" until history and even prehistory are overcome, laid open to the transformative movement of the poem as a whole. Knight is correct when he points out that "these hammers of flame and fierce gyra tions ... are used to show Keats's 'supreme of power' now piercing, revealing, redeeming, and annihilating all past agonies of Man and Earth."20 In order for this to happen, the sphere must complete its revelations, and Ione's vision of the child in Beulah must be tran scended by the fierce insight of the apocalyptic child asleep in the earth-sphere. The technique here is essentially ironic, but not in the usual sense. Earl Wasserman, writing on Adonais, frames an excellent definition of the ironic mode in that poem which, I think, can be ex tended to Shelley's work in general: "The evolution of the poem gains its inevitability from ambivalences and inversions of such a na ture that, while the materials nearly tolerate a coherent interpretation from false perspectives, they are weighted to compel their true order ing and interpretation."21 Ione's comment is an excellent example of such a false perspective; however beautiful and satisfying in a human istic sense Ione's slight irony is, it is not enough?it takes us back to the condition of the earlier passage, "Sweet as a singing rain of silver dew." In order for the actual to be overcome by the potential, the process must continue. Without denying that the scientific allegorizers of the next pas sage, such as Professor Grabo, may have validity in their readings, I am not so much interested in what these lines (270-318) refer to as in how they advance the action of the poem. The function of this pas sage is to bring to full reality as much as the mind of an already liber ated mankind can conceive. The beams of the flashing star on the forehead of the infant can be identified with the very process of thought, the birth of thought in the brain, which is in Shelley also the beginning of poetry, "swifter than thought." The "sun-like lighten ings," the creative mind aflame, fill the abyss of uncreated things, and by revealing them, create them. Notice how this passage moves characteristically from the static to the kinetic, beginning with "In finite mines of adamant and gold" (iv.280) and moving to "earth's mountaintops" clothed "With kingly, ermine snow" (iv.287). This 20. Knight, p. 223. 21. The Subtler Language (Baltimore, 1959), p. 361.</page><page sequence="9">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 115 contains its own collapse because this snow recalls the "sun-awakened avalanche" of Act n, scene iii, whose mass Thrice sifted by the storm, had gathered there Flake after flake, in heaven-defying minds As thought by thought is piled, till some great truth Is loosened, and the nations echo round, Shaken to their roots, as do the mountains now. (n.iii.38-42) The great truth freed in the second and third acts had social, political, humanistic implications. Here, in Act iv, it is the very structure of things Shelley would dissolve through the action of mind upon mat ter. This reminiscence sets the process going again and brings to light "the melancholy ruins | Of cancelled cycles." The subsequent vision (11. 289-318), extraordinary in its harsh diction and recalling the Ozymandias mood but now transcending any mere moral pointing, presents "ruin within ruin" to be overcome by the mind; then it moves to the wrecks of cities whose population "was mortal, but not hu man," and back beyond them to "prodigious shapes | Huddled in gray annihilation," and thence to creatures of the deep, and finally to the behemoths themselves who "Increased and multiplied like sum mer worms I On an abandoned corpse." At this point, we witness the most extraordinary completion in Shelley's poetry. The "earth convulsing behemoth" is the most terrific phenomenon that the Shelleyan method can annihilate, and the apocalyptic deluge that overcomes this suddenly monstrous vision, in which the poetic mind itself seems overborne, is the terrible but necessary "quenching" Shelley has been seeking since this particular process was kindled at line 180. Yet Shelley offers an alternative, and more hopeful, cancel lation. The image of the deluge gives way to this: "or some God | Whose throne was in a comet, passed, and cried. | 'Be not!' And like my words they were no more" (iv.316-318). This startling image brings together the strategic devices of the en tire section we have been examining. This God can be identified with the enthroned infants of the moon-chariot and the earth-sphere, now grown to full demiurgic stature; moreover, the image serves as a literal deus ex machina, outside, paradoxically, the world Shelley's process has been destroying, and, therefore, while that world is de stroyed, the creative power of continuity is maintained. Above all, we see here the completion of one thrust of the Shelleyan logos. The</page><page sequence="10">116 D.J.HUGHES command "Be not!", which can be taken as the poetic motivation of the entire scene (11.180-318), cancels not only the phenomenal world, but also the Word that Shelley has been building throughout. We return to Panthea, "And like my words they were no more." With the ending of Panthea's words, the phenomenal, and the logos behind it, collapse; but a creative, saving power above this world has been revealed. This device compares interestingly with two uses of such an image in Epipsychidion. In the second part of the poem Shelley de scribes the fading of the Emily-figure he has been seeking: But She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame, Passed, like a God throned on a winged planet, Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it, Into the dreary cone of our life's shade. (224-228) But the God of Prometheus Unbound has destroyed this very cone, and the poem need not return to the world. The deity of Panthea's vision is more akin to the Comet of Epipsychidion, who, brought into the poem at line 368, "Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce," serves to stabilize the Shelleyan process and make possible the invitation to the voyage of the last third of the poem. With the destruction complete, the exaltation of the marriage rites of the earth and moon has been prepared for, "The joy, the triumph, the delight, the madness!" have been made possible by an ontological reversal unparalleled in English poetry. We have taken the greatest of Shelley's boat rides, in the frailest of all his vehicles, the "thinnest boat," and we have ended in cataclysm, but have emerged safely. The Potential has overcome the Actual. 11 To speak of Prometheus Unbound in terms of ontological transforma tion, we should be able to see such a mode operating at every signifi cant juncture of the poem. I will limit my further examination in this paper to three passages that come immediately to mind when the poem is viewed in this light: Act 11, scenes ii and iii, the approach to Demogorgon's cave by Asia and Panthea, and scene v, the end of the second act, the voyage taken by Asia in the enchanted boat. The first of these passages (n.ii), the approach to Demogorgon's cave by the unseen Oceanides, is a brilliant rendering of Mallarmean</page><page sequence="11">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 117 absence, the gradual emptying-out of the phenomenal and the sug gested and gradual presence of the noumenal. The first Semichorus of Spirits introduces us to what I think is the main purpose of the scene: to draw us toward the potential and away from sense percep tion, both of sight and hearing. The path taken by Asia and Panthea is "curtained out from Heaven's wide blue," but the Shelleyan beat itudes of transformation are operative: the cloud of dew that "hangs each a pearl in the pale flowers | Of the green laurel, blown anew," and the star that cleaves through those interwoven bowers to let its beams fall, serve as guides to mark the way, while the mind itself be comes like the "frail and fair anemone" that "bends, and then fades silently" (11.ii.12). The close of this first semichorus completes the pattern of withdrawal, both in its sound effects and in its change from visual to tactile sensation: "And the gloom divine is all around, | And underneath is the mossy ground" (ii.ii.22-23). Semichorus 11, praised by some and damned by others, keeps the scene moving by describ ing the continuity of the sound that itself must fade into the larger harmonies of "Demogorgon's mighty law." The sexual sense of this lyric about the nightingales is important and has been noted before, but I think Leone Vivante has best described the function of this scene, "in which thought is distinctly represented in its ever-originat ing character. The new moment takes wing, as it were, out of the infinite in which the preceding one dissolves?and in tune with it."22 The song of the nightingales then moves to a transcending intensity until "Sounds overflow the listener's brain | So sweet, that joy is al most pain" (ii.ii.39-40). Each of these first two semichoruses ends in a mild Shelleyan collapse, preparing the way for the largest develop ment in this scene, the third lyric in which, in small compass, the familiar soul-history of Shelley's poetry (cf. Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, Epipsychidion, etc.) is presented as a manifestation of the with drawal from the existent. I take "Demogorgon's mighty law," much allegorized and guessed at, to be the very process of transformation Shelley is describing, the restoration of the potential to itself. The boat imagery is familiar, as is the call to prophetic vocation. Of more interest, perhaps, is the nice balance between the willed and the neces sary (like the poetic process itself) described in lines 53-57, and the completion of the first half of this scene with the appearance of the 22. English Poetry and its Contribution to the Knowledge of a Creative Principle (Lon don, 1950), p. 148.</page><page sequence="12">118 D. J. HUGHES fatal mountain of Demogorgon. The movement of mind has ranged widely in these passages from the "frail and fair anemone" of the be ginning to the fatal mountain that this particular fading coal has sought as its termination. The conversation between the two fauns that follows is best un derstood, I think, in its dramatic function. Shelley is nowhere near ready to bring Asia's transformation to completion. The fauns serve as commentators and as quiet points of release, much as do Apollo and Ocean after the fall of Jupiter. Curiously, considering the fan tastic nature of the whole, the fauns bring some realism and solidity back into the scene, while at the same time they point to the possi bility of other transformations like the one just described. Shelley's common technique of combining the evanescent and the solid, so magnificently developed in Act iv, finds expression here in the de scription of the dwelling place of the spirits who have spoken. They dwell in the bubbles (here limned as "pavilions") which are taken back to the sea, and the cycle through which they pass is described in familiar terms. When noontide has kindled the atmosphere, these burst, and the thin fiery air The which they breathed within those lucent domes, Ascends to flow like meteors through the night, They ride on them, and rein their headlong speed, And bow their burning crests, and glide in fire Under the waters of the earth again. (n.ii.77-82) This image-cluster, descriptive of Shelley's poetic method and point ing to the comet-riding deity of Act iv, suggests a cyclic process that must finally give way to completed stasis, but that development is a long way off at this point in the poem. The last speech of this scene points to the future, the freeing of Prometheus that Silenus, a Shel leyan poet-prophet, will sing of, a song the fauns wish to hear. In a sense, the fauns are lower beings, outside the transforming develop ments of the second act, though they are aware of the true prophetic note. At the end of this scene, we are promised a greater music still: "delightful strains which cheer ( Our solitary twilights, and which charm | To silence the unenvying nightingales" (11.ii.95?97). This is the silence towards which the whole scene has been tending, where even the continuous sound of the nightingales must yield to the prophetic voice of liberation.</page><page sequence="13">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 119 Act n, scene iii, continues the unwinding process of the whole act, but the reintroduction of Asia and Panthea returns us to those still untransfigured beings who must be overcome. The best description of this scene, I think, is by G. M. Matthews: "the objective setting seems unchallengeable: the nymphs have been attracted (impelled) to the terminal cone of a colossal volcano."23 The "oracular vapour" which the poet-prophets inhale can be related to the dew of the po tential in scene ii, here become active. The "voice which is contagion to the world" (n.iii.io) may be the voice of political revolution, but revolution better understood as metaphysical change, ontological transformation. Asia's Shelleyan gesture, her willingness to fall down in worship before the spirit of whom the scene is but a shadow, "weak, but beautiful," foreshadows the incredible transmutations of the fourth act, where the earth-spirit is encased in the complex ma chinery already discussed, beautiful, yes, but overcoming all weak ness. The much-lauded metaphor that concludes the description here, almost the finest example of Shelley's presentation of matter in terms of mind, sets the process of descent going again, and, as I have already pointed out, recalls the frozen world of the opening of the poem. The imperfectly realized beings that now beckon Asia downward symbolize the proliferation of the possible that waits, and the descent to the cave is the climactic surrender of the actual in the first stages of the poem, although the ultimate transfiguration of Asia will not, of course, take place until the end of this act. The brilliant lyric of descent that brings Asia and Panthea to Dem ogorgon's cave takes us further from the actual; such falling will be balanced later by the "horizontal" movement of the enchanted boat lyric, but, appropriately, the approach to Demogorgon is seen as a terrifying fall. The Shelleyan boat ride, usually symbolizing the proc ess of mind seeking its fullest object (often seen as an Elysian isle), would not be appropriate here, since Demogorgon is not a point of hoped-for resolution but rather the beginning of mystery. Asia and Panthea, bound by the spirits who take them to the cave, pass through both death and life, thus breaking the natural cycle, freed from the tragic vision of Blake's mental traveller. Shelley's travellers let go both appearance and reality to come upon a state that contains them both. 23. "A Volcano's Voice in Shelley," ELH, xxiv (1957), 211.</page><page sequence="14">120 D.J.HUGHES The images of this lyric are images of thought reaching for hypo statization, figures suggested and then denied. "As the fawn draws the hound" suggests the sadomasochistic pursuit by which Shelley often expresses the nature of thought, the best example of which is the Actaeon passage of Adonais: "And his own thoughts, along that rugged way, | Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey."24 The reversal of the grammatical order in the second stanza is part of Shelley's whole strategy of reversal in this act, while the nega tives of the third stanza continue this development until the heavens and the cavern-crags are abolished, along with the darkness of earth: "Nor the gloom to Earth given" (11.iii.79). The images of the fourth stanza of this lyric are images of Potentiality, power withheld, seek ing a fresh actualization. Such images indicate that this lyric is, in part, "about" the creative process itself, the Shelleyan fading coal. The "veiled lightning asleep" and the "spark nursed in embers" point to the possibility of poetry; the "last look love remembers," as often in Shelley, signifies the creative absence that starts the poem, while the last image, "Like a diamond, which shines | On the dark wealth of mines" (86-87), points to the secret internality of the po tential state, as well as to the hardness of its possible form. The concluding stanza of this lyric shifts the emphasis from the dizzying, downward flight itself to the moral injunction of the spirit. The "weakness" that Asia is urged not to resist is the final giving up of the actual, the release of the merely phenomenal which the entire second act is devoted to spiritualizing. She has already shown herself in this scene willing to fall down and worship the spirit, and her con tinued surrender is proof of her capacity to be the vehicle of the transforming power of love in the poem. The "meekness" in which she will find strength is the putting off of Blakean-Shelleyan Self hood, the abandonment of the narrowly-ordering ego that finds forms completed, static, mechanical. If these are surrendered, Dem ogorgon will "unloose through life's portal" the Doom of Jupiter, "snake-like" because the snake stands for the cyclical development from father to child, that is, from Saturn to Jupiter to Demogorgon, a cycle that comes to an end with the release of Prometheus.25 The 24.

This must be distinguished from the amphis</page><page sequence="15">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 121 concluding lines, with their hollow O's, and the curious dimeter line that concludes the whole lyric set us down firmly, deep within the world of Demogorgon, an echoing promise of what is to come. But the transformation of Asia into a potential state is not com plete; she is merely brought into its realm. The two concluding lyrics of Act ii, "Life of Life" and "My soul is an enchanted boat," com plete this process. These are, of course, very famous moments in the poem and famous in themselves. Yet, for all the discussion these poems have occasioned, critics have been insufficiently aware of their rightness here at the end of the second act and the inevitable relation ship they have to each other. After the attempt at hypostasis in the first lyric, with its calculated collapse ("Dizzy, lost, yet unbewail ing!"), the impulse towards movement is necessary, and that this should take the form of the boat ride should surprise no one?we see the same development: stabilization, calculated collapse, and then the voyage out in Epipsychidion and elsewhere. The "Life of Life" lyric is Shelley's most delicately sustained hypostasis, with the last line of each stanza threatening to break down the very image the stanza has sought to maintain. Then Asia's answer in the enchanted boat lyric is the fully appropriate response, and the inevitable one, as her soul seeks its final point of rest. The last stanza is our main concern. Whatever its Platonic and Wordsworthian sources or analogues, this return to a pre-existent state represents one of the climaxes of the return to Potentiality in the poem, a journey we have been taking since the first scene of this act. The higher innocence of Blake, the yearning for the primordial waters in Wordsworth, the search for the unitive ground in Cole ridge, even the Keatsian ritualistic quest for the finer tone?all bear upon this lyric, one of the key moments, it seems to me, in English Romanticism. Asia, now transfigured by love, about to rejoin the transformed Prometheus, like the Romantic poet must seek out her origins in order that the present time be redeemed. "Age's icy caves" reminds us again of the frozen world of the poem's beginning, and while "Manhood's dark and tossing waves" may be too much of a "public image," as Harold Bloom suggests,26 the momentum is re captured in "Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray," the confi baena of Prometheus, m.iv.119, an image of the cycle overcome, an image of open form, with a head at either end. 26. Bloom, p. 130.</page><page sequence="16">122 D. J. HUGHES dent beginning of the Shelleyan quest that so often gives way to de spair. But here the "betrayal" is overcome by the backward movement of Asia's boat. She passes beyond "shadow-peopled Infancy, | Through Death and Birth, to a diviner day" (in.v.104-105), and by so doing comes upon the Shelleyan lower Paradise, the Great Good Place which Bloom, I think convincingly, compares with the Blak ean Beulah-land.27 It is also worth noting that this "paradise of vaulted bowers" is seen as a perfect internality, "Lit by downward gazing flowers" suggesting a higher narcissism, an achieved recovery of a total and undivided state, "Peopled by shapes too bright to see," which walk upon the water, singing?the potential in Shelley often signified by this fortunate combination of light and music. It is also worth remarking that the confused syntax here (I think the sense finds Asia and her pilot "resting," i.e., coming to a stop, and the "thee" to whom she speaks is her pilot, the voice in the air) brings the lyric to, as Locock says, "a wretchedly weak conclusion."28 This, I think, is not the calculated collapse that closes the "Life of Life" lyric, but a simple failure to bring the voyage to an artistically satisfy ing conclusion. Shelley has not devised a strategy to keep this coal from fading satisfactorily and, in fact, does not want to suggest final ity here. The next two acts of the drama must do this for him; so Asia's trip ends lamely enough. Only in Adonais, perhaps, does this kind of Shelleyan voyage reach triumphant port?and even there it is at the cost of personal annihilation. hi The sections of the poem we have studied, Act iv, lines 180-318, and n, scenes ii, iii, and v, define the characteristic movement of mind in the poem; the cleansing of the actual that a new potential may emerge. The whole poem, I think, could be profitably analyzed from this perspective. Shelley is concerned with reform in the poem, but the reform is more metaphysical than political and more ontological than social. The poem, in its movement from the tragic stasis of the opening to the lyrical stasis of the close, proceeds through a series of strategic maneuvers that spiritualize the physical and make possible what has already hardened into fact. All this, of course, is purely mental and manifests perhaps the most inspired wish in English liter 27. Bloom, p. 130. 28. Locock, p. 616.</page><page sequence="17">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 123 ature. Comparing The Triumph of Life with Prometheus, Harold Bloom writes precisely: The hope here in Prometheus is dialectical, but is still hope; Shelley believes in his myth. In The Triumph of Life faith in the myth is abandoned. This does not mean that Shelley rejects the myth, thinks it false. The myth itself is aware of its necessary defeat, but affirms human possibility. In Prometheus Shelley dwells in possibility, with all its windows and doors. In The Triumph ... the fairer house is deserted for the vision of human probability.29 This dwelling in possibility, or, as I have termed it, the return to Potentiality, takes two forms in the passages we have discussed. The second of these, Asia's descent to Demogorgon and her voyage out in the enchanted boat, describes the process of this return in terms of the individual soul; the other passage, the visions of the moon-chariot and the sphere of the earth, has more to do with the return to the potential of the very structure of created things. By this time in the drama, the recognizably anthropomorphic figures have been put aside. While Prometheus and Asia inhabit their cave, a larger process takes over and completes Shelley's form. The sources of Asia's enchanted boat ride have long been traced to several Platonic and Neoplatonic texts. Perhaps the most relevant for our purposes is the following from the Phaedrus. Speaking of pre existence, Socrates says: And then we beheld the beatific vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most blessed, celebrated by us in our state of innocence, before we had any experience of evils to come, when we were admitted to the sight of ap paritions innocent and simple and calm and happy, which we beheld shining in pure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger over the memory of scenes which have passed away.30 This is clearly the situation to which Asia has returned at the end of Act ii, and the significance of her return rests in a state of recovered innocence, the higher innocence which so dominates the most char acteristic Romantic poetry. The Platonic anamnesis, of which Asia's voyage is a splendid example, is essentially a psychological phenome non, and the cleansing of the human psyche in Prometheus Unbound particularly as this is expressed in Act n, points the way to an essen 29.

But the other passage we have examined, iv, lines 180-318, has less to do with human possibility as with the structure of Being itself as the mind, and particularly the mind of the poet, is able to conceive it. The extraordinary development from the thinnest boat of the moon-chariot to the comet-enthroned deity who cancels creation is a single movement of thought, precise in its detail and inevitable in its progress. The passage seems to me, as does all of Prometheus Un bound, an attempt to mirror the creative mind at full stretch, and ulti mately to be self-reflexive, about itself. All the admitted failures and yet continuing attempts to allegorize the poem fail, I think, because of the failure to recognize its organic development in terms of the creative process and the way Shelley apparently wrote and conceived his poems. His remark in the Defence that "the most glorious poetry that has ever been communicated to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the original conceptions of the poet" may be a dubious point in the construction of a poetics, but it illuminates the Shelleyan problem exactly. Shelley's poetry seeks the form that will best re cover what that form, by actualizing itself, must necessarily lose. This concept of form is best explained by Signor Leone Vivante, whose philosophy of indeterminism as expressed in A Philosophy of Potentiality and whose chapter on Shelley in his English Poetry and its Contribution to the Knowledge of a Creative Principle have been of great value to the present writer. Vivante views form in this way: Form?in other words, actualization, consciousness taking shape, presence?how ever essential to value, does not entirely explain it. What is the element which we call image, expression, form, actualization, in comparison with the immensity of sorrow, of love, of sacrifice? What is the pang?the form?of a desperate sorrow, as compared with the infinite virtuality which, in that very moment, seems to ex ceed our consciousness? Form, though it be a primal force and an original motive value, in which power itself is inflamed, enriched and confirmed, exalted and ap peased, cannot be compared with such an infinite intimate urge?which yet does not exist without an element of form and which craves for form. Potentiality, however much it may have its raison d'etre in actualization, nevertheless exceeds actualization and every existentiality of its own.31 Such a conception of the relation between form and that out of which form emerges helps to explain some of the failures in Shelley's poetry and some of those necessary collapses in which the form of his 31. A Philosophy of Potentiality (London, 1955), p. 46.</page><page sequence="19">POTENTIALITY IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 125 thought itself runs its course to completion, but the poem itself does not fail as an aesthetic structure. We might say that in the great pas sages of Act iv Potentiality indeed exceeds every existentiality, the destructive progress of the beams from the earth-infant returning us to the fullest Potentiality, an apocalyptic stasis in which time and the cyclical process come to an end. The Shelleyan form exists to mirror consciousness, not conscious ness of any particular object, but the fact of consciousness itself. Again, Signor Vivante offers the best definition for our purposes: Consciousness is first of all an immediate value of actualization, beyond any dis tinction between subject and object. And this not only in germinal or vague, in definite moments, but in the highest forms of thought. The positing of the object belongs?in tendency?to the processes of external construction and extrinsic causality, where all deep and rich implication of value?all originality, all fecund spontaneity of intelligence is lost. So much so that creative positivity finds an ob stacle not only in the object, but in its very form, inasmuch as this tends to objectify itself. The garment of the flame of the spirit falls to ashes as soon as looked at.32 We recognize the Shelleyan image here, whether intentional or not, for this account of consciousness is similar to Shelley's theory of the fading coal. Moreover, viewing the Shelleyan process in this light, we can see that the tendency in Shelley's work to transcend the ob ject is not, as has long been charged, a manifestation of a weak grasp of the actual, but, put positively, should be seen as a demonstration of the poet's profound awareness of the processes of thought and poetry. At its best, Shelley's poetry is of the profoundest value in revealing to us the sources of consciousness and the unity of its concerns. Prometheus Unbound is the crucial example of this development in Shelley's poetry because it is the most ambitious attempt in his work to restore our sense of the beginning of things. The poem seeks to establish a pure present, beyond time, by moving backward to the pre-existent, for, while the whole appears to press towards futurity, it does so not that a new existent may emerge, but that a new Poten tiality may sustain itself; it mirrors the mind freed from the causal, purified, transformed. The passages I have examined, Asia's descent to Demogorgon and her final transformation, and the great visions of the fourth act, are vital instances of the true structure of the poem. At first, their motives seem very different: Asia, as Eros, moves back ward to a prior state of being, recovering the potential through a re 32.

HUGHES flexive act; the visions of the moon-chariot and the earth-sphere move forward from the beginning of things, through the destructive process of time, to annihilation. But the end is the same; we arrive at Pure Being. Such a voyage must be distinguished from the transcend ence of Adonais, which invokes death as the solution to poetic and in tellectual form. There is no symbolic dying of this kind in Prometheus. The dualism that finally overwhelms Shelley in The Triumph of Life &gt; and of which Adonais is merely the opposite coin, is absent in Pro metheus. There, Potentiality reigns.
