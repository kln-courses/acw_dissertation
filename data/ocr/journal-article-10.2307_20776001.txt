<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DATES AND SOURCES OF SHELLEY'S META PHYSICAL, MORAL, AND RELIGIOUS ESSAYS By David Lee Clark By the time Shelley went up to Oxford in October 1810, he had a definite bent toward speculation. At Eton he had read Godwin's Political Justice,1 a book which aroused in him a passion for reforming the world. He had also studied Franklin, who had convinced him of the eventual triumph of mind over matter;2 Pliny's Natural History, whose chapter De Deo destroyed any rational belief in an anthropomorphic God; Lucretius, whose De Rerum Na tura helped to free Shelley's mind from the trammels of superstition. While at Eton the future poet had dipped into the forbidden lore of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. It is not unlikely that Dr. Lind's library at Eton, which Shelley had frequented, contained also Locke, Hume, and the French philosophers of the Enlightenment. In all of these, no doubt, the aspiring metaphysician browsed at will. Shelley's contemporary letters and his first publica tions give evidence of his acquaintance with the dominant metaphysical and moral questions of his day. His metaphysical and moral essays have usually been dated between 1815 and 1820. It is the purpose of this article to show that the bulk of these essays were composed several years earlier than the period to which the essays have generally been assigned. If this can be done, it will obviate the difficulties facing Shelley scholars of explain ing how the subject matter of these essays, if composed 1815-1820, can be reconciled with that of the poems known to have been composed 1815-1820. Shelley several times in his letters refers familiarly to Godwin and his writings before 1812. See especially letter to Hogg, Decem ber 20, 1810, or those for May 13 (?) and 18, 1811, to Hogg; to Elizabeth Hitchener, November 26, 1811, and December 26, 1811, and January 12,1812, and that to Godwin, January 10, 1812. 2See letter, February 6, 1810 (misdated for 1811) to Timothy Shelley, his father, where Franklin is described as a moral character and as a deist.</page><page sequence="2">David Lee Clark 161 Shelley's speculative tendencies brought upon him much annoying notoriety at Eton. And he was soon to learn that even at Oxford, religion and morals were not to be approached, with reason, as one would essay a proposition in Euclid. He was already beginning to feel the strong arm of religion and morality. Had not superstition and intolerance alienated his father and his fiancee? It was toward the end of 1810 that Shelley dedicated himself to the eradication of religious and moral prejudices, declar ing that nothing would be sacred to him but Truth.3 So, after only a few months in the University, with Locke and Hume as bodyguard, Shelley sallied forth to break his lance with the Fathers of the Church. The first result was a daring pamphlet, The Necessity of Atheism, designed to destroy the anthropomorphic God of Christianity. He asked sincerely and reasonably for a refutation by the bishops, but instead he received a summary dismissal from the University.4 Now an outcast from the University, Shelley resolved upon the composition of a series of metaphysical, moral, religious essays that would confound the bishops, destroy institutionalized Christianity by. reasserting the social and moral teachings of Jesus, enthrone truth through Science, and establish happiness on a solid foundation of ethical principles. We first hear of the design, August 1, 1811, when he wrote to Stockdale, his London publisher, that he was "engaged in completing a series of moral and meta physical essays/'5 On December 26 of the same year in a letter to Elizabeth Hitchener he remarked that he was ^Letter to Hogg, December 20, 1810. 4That Shelley had been planning an attack upon Christian doc trines is evident from his letter to Stockdale, November 11, 1810, ordering a "Hebrew essay demonstrating that the Christian religion is false." Julian Edition, 8:17. (All references unless otherwise noted are to the Julian Edition.) Eight days later, Shelley ordered a copy of Godwin's Political Justice. In letters to Hogg in January and February, 1811, before its publication in March, Shelley stated the arguments of The Necessity of Atheism. 5Julian 8:137.</page><page sequence="3">162 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays composing some essays which he designed to publish in the summer?that is, the summer of 1812.6 Later, he wrote to Miss Hitchener that he had finished "about 150 (pages) of the essays."7 Sometime in February or March, 1812, Shelley put these essays into the hands of R. and J. Stock dale, Dublin printers (not to be confused with the London publishers of the same name), for immediate publication. They were in part, if not entirely, set up in type, and were expected to appear in expensive dress.8 But Shelley's finances being in bad shape, he was unable to pay for the printing, and the Stockdales were unwilling to surrender either the manuscripts or the printed sheets. After his return to England, Shelley appealed to his friends in Dub lin to get his manuscripts released, but the Stockdales were obdurate. And on August 18, 1812, he wrote dejectedly to Hookham, his London publisher, "I shall, if possible, prepare a volume of essays, moral and religious, by Novem ber ; but, all my MSS. now being in Dublin, and from pecu liar circumstances not immediately obtainable, I do not know whether I can."9 They must have been returned to Shelley before January 16, 1813, for on that date Harriet wrote to Catherine Nugent that Shelley wished to thank her for her successful "embassy to Stockdale, who will hear from Shelley soon."10 There is no record that Hookham or any other publisher issued these essays under any such title as metaphysical, moral, and religious essays. After Shelley's death a number of essays of that nature were found among his unpublished manuscripts. It is the conviction of the present writer that the essays which Shelley composed in 1810 and 1813, the same that were in the hands of the Dublin Stockdales, are those which now go under the general title of prose frag ments of metaphysical, moral, and religious essays, namely: 6Julian 8:223. 7January 2, 1812, Julian 8:227. 8Julian 8:245. 9Julian 9:18-19. 10Julian 9:41.</page><page sequence="4">David Lee Clark 163 Essay on Christianity, On the Moral Teachings of Christ, On the Moral Doctrines of Christ, On God, On Miracles, On Marriage, Speculations on Metaphysics, Speculations on Morals, On the Punishment of Death, On a Future State, On Love, and On Life. A Vindication of Natural Diet and A Refutation of Deism, which probably were among the manuscripts submitted to the Stockdales, were published by Shelley in 1813 and 1814 respectively. Contrary to the general assumption that the Notes to Queen Mob were the earlier and contained the original germs for many of the Prose Fragments,11 it now seems likely that Shelley drew upon several of these essays in the compilation of the Notes to Queen Mab in the early months of 1813.12 There is no agreement among Shelley scholars as to the dates of the essays. Guesses have ranged from 1814 to 1821, with the older editors, Forman, Rossetti, Dowden, favoring 1815 as the probable date. Shawcross assigns all of them to 181513; Koszul, to 1815 or 181714; Ingpen, 1815, but some to as early as 1814.15 The evidence for my conviction that the essays were com posed in 1810-1813 and for the most part were identical with the essays now published as prose essays and frag ments is based upon seven facts: first, that the Journal of Shelley and Mary, begun on July 28, 1814, is absolutely silent about the essays; second, that Shelley's letters, which invariably reflect his literary activities?every known pro duction of his being mentioned or discussed in letters at the time of its composition or its publication?after 1814 are also silent; third, that the similarity in thought and ^Compare those on Jesus, Christianity, God, and Marriage. 12See my "The Data and Sources of Shelley's A Vindication of Natural Diet" Studies in Philology, 36:70-76, January, 1939. 13Edited, John Shawcross, Shelley's Literary and Philosophical Criticism, (London, 1909). 14A.

Some of these facts will now be examined in detail. An examination will, I believe, convince the most scepti cal that the essays are contemporaneous with the letters of 1810-1813. A survey of the letters shows that of the one hundred and seven letters touching the subject-matter of the essays, three were written in 1810; forty-four in 1811; twenty-six in 1812; three in 1813; none in 1814; two in 1815; eight in 1819; three in 1820; five in 1821; and one in 1822. This is revealing: it shows that Shelley's mind dur ing 1810-1813, when seventy-three of the letters were com posed, was very definitely and almost incessantly engrossed with metaphysical, moral, and religious problems. By 1814, when Shelley had given up the idea of reforming the world by appeals to reason and had turned to poetry as an in direct and perhaps a more effectual means, the letters al most cease to touch on speculative matter. From 1813 to 1815 inclusive there are only two letters dealing with the ideas expressed in the essays. Had Shelley composed the essays during these years, as asserted by most Shelley scholars, it is inconceivable that the letters would be so very silent. As a matter of fact his letters make it clear that the great speculative and formative period of Shelley's life was 1810-1813, the period that coincides with his first bitter experience with positive institutions.</page><page sequence="6">David Lee Clark 165 It was during these years that Shelley was deeply in terested in Jesus, Spinoza, Newton, Locke, Berkeley, Reid, Drummond, Hume, Godwin, Paine, and the French philoso phers?particularly Holbach, Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire, and Condorcet.16 He mentions them by name; he orders the works of many of them from his bookseller; and he quotes or translates or paraphrases them. Now, it was from these sources, particularly from Jesus, Spinoza, New ton, Locke, Berkeley, Reid, Drummond, Hume, Godwin, and Paine, that Shelley drew the ideas for the essays, ideas which he elaborates in the letters. This fact would appear to furnish almost incontrovertible proof that the essays and letters were written during this period of the poet's development. Certainly, the language of the letters of 1810 13 period and that of the essays is so similar, and on the contrary so different from that of the letters of any other period, that one is driven to the conclusion that the two were contemporaneous. The ideas, however, which he gleaned from the reading he did in this period, though later changed in varying degrees by the magic of his own mind and transmuted by a powerful imagination into philosophi cal poetry of the first order, remained essentially the same to the end of his life. So, when in 1815, Shelley definitely and finally turned from speculative prose to philosophical poetry he did not turn his back on his early principles? he merely changed the medium of transmission. Shelley's prose must thus be regarded as an integral part of the poet's work, an understanding of which, therefore, is emi nently necessary for a sound appreciation of his poetry and invaluable in understanding his development. When 16For Locke, see letters February 6, 1810; June 5, 11, 25; July 4, 19; December 11, 1811, and June, 1812. For Hume, Newton, Franklin, Rousseau, Voltaire, see letter February 6, 1810.

All of these authors are referred to or quoted in other letters or essays of this period.</page><page sequence="7">166 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays the essays are studied as of the early formative period of his life, students can come to a juster interpretation of the poet's life and work. One will not be under the necessity of explaining how the essays could not fit into the period of 1815-1817, a period of intense poetic creation. Let us now compare some of the leading ideas in the es says with those in the letters for a possible establishment of their dates and their sources. At the outset it should be stated that Shelley was a keen, but not a systematic or original, thinker. So we may rest assured that the germ of almost every idea was definitely expressed in or was latent in, some book which he had read or was reading at the time. In the note-book]7 containing the so-called essay on Chris tianity are two fragments: On God, which seems to be an early draft, is for the most part identical, word for word, with a long passage in A Refutation of Deism, which, as we believe, was composed in early 1813; the other one, that On Marriage, was probably meant as an explanation of Christ's conception of marriage, for there are two marginal notes in the original manuscript, which read: The similitude of doctrine between Jesus Christ and the Cynics on the subject of marriage and love, and Jesus Christ's idea of marriage. "See Milton on Divorce."18 Mr. Koszul's assertion (p. 57) that Shelley is closely following Godwin's ideas on marriage as set forth in Political Justice, Vol. II, Chap. VI, is er roneous, for only one point?that of considering women as private property?do they have in common; Shelley is, however, drawing heavily on Hume's essay, "Polygamy and Divorce," as he certainly did in the Note on marriage in Queen Mab.19 Shelley says that the institution of mar riage like that of property grew up in the rude age as a 17Described by A. H. Koszul in Shelley's Prose in the Bodeleian Manuscripts (London, 1810). 18First pointed out by A. H. Koszul, Idem., p. 46. 19Essays: Moral, Political, and Literary, ed., T. H. Green and T. H. Grose, two volumes, (London, 1912), II: 231-239. (See paragraph, p. 237.)</page><page sequence="8">David Lee Clark 167 monopoly. Any infringement of this property right in women was thought of as criminal by one's immediate clan; however, all actions, says Shelley, should be judged by a standard strictly universal. The greatest good to the great est number, Priestley's phrase, should determine one's action. "The origin of laws, therefore, was the origin of crime,"20 though right and wrong have existed from the time one human being could sympathize with another in pleasure or pain. All error in moral science has originated in the confusion of law with right.21 The letters of 1810 1813 strike the same note on marriage! Yet marriage ... is hateful, detestable . . . the most despotic, most unrequired fetter which prejudice has forged to confine its energies . . . this is the fruit of superstition. ... Is matrimony not the most horrid of all the means which the world has had recourse to, to bind the noble to itself? . . . But later [he says] I will hear your argu ments for matrimonialism, by which I am now almost convinced. . . . I am become a perfect convert to matrimony . . . from your argu ments . . . the one argument, which you have urged . . . the sacri fice made by the woman.22 In other letters we learn that Shelley submitted to matri mony on the ground that custom had decreed it so, and that he believed that a general reformation in morals was: necessary before the institution of matrimony should be abolished.23 In this last remark he is following Hume, not Godwin. The sentiments expressed in these letters are the same as those in the fragment On Marriage. The other fragment,24 that On God, is the statement of 20An Address to the Irish People, Shepherd, I: 244. This idea is found in Hume's essay and in Paine's Commons ens e, which Shelley was reading at the time and from which he borrowed (verbatim) for other essays known to have been written in 1812. 21The closing chapter of St. Irvyne (1810) echoes the same senti ments on marriage as the Fragment and the letters of 1810-1812. 22From the letters of May 12, June 21, August 3, August 15, and November 26, 1811. 23See letter for October 8, 1811: January 28, July 7, August 17, 1812. 24In the same notebook, p. 84, following immediately the fragment On God, are suggestions for several essays, some of which were actually written.</page><page sequence="9">168 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays On the nature of Metaphysical Science.

On the economy of associated ideas?Happiness On Jesus Christ A Future State?the arguments stated. the deistic conception of God based on the argument from design and intelligence in the universe. The fragment may be condensed as follows: The Universe shows its admirable fitness for the production of cer tain effects and a universal harmony by whose invariable laws in numerable systems of worlds perform their stated revolutions. . . . The Universe required an intelligent Creator . . . thus we arrive at the Deisms true proposition. 'That whatever exists, producing certain effects, stands in need of a Creator, and the more conspicuous is its fitness for the production of these effects, the more certain will be our conclusion, that it could not have existed from eternity, but de rives its origin from an intelligent creator.' [Then the question is posed,] Who created the Creator? The assumption that the Universe is a design leads to a conclusion that there is an infinity of creative and created Gods, which is absurd. It is easier to suppose that the Universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive an eternal being capable of creating it. Man in his ignorance attributes to the Deity human passions. ... A man knows, not only that he now is, but that there was a time when he did not exist. Certain passages of this fragment were taken verbatim from Shelley's first speculative essay, The Necessity of Atheism (18T1). The same passages25 were repeated ver batim in The Refutation (1813), and in a note to Queen Mab (January-March, 1813).26 In The Refutation it is shepherd, 1:315-318; 325-326. 26Koszul believes that the fragment is a later work, a revision of a portion of the Refutation, because it appears to be more precise, ac curate, and fuller. A careful study leads me to believe that the Refu tation is the second and final draft. It is complete, fuller. It should be noted that in the Refutation Shelley bases some of his arguments upon several Latin authors whose names are scribbled on the margin of the MS. of On God. Now, in a letter dated November 26, 1813, Shelley says that he has been reading the philosophical works of Cicero. It was from Cicero that he copied the names of the Latin authors. Furthermore, Cicero's De Natura Deorum is quoted in the Refutation.</page><page sequence="10">David Lee Clark 169 clearly indicated by references and footnotes that the sources of Shelley's ideas were Hume, Locke, Bacon, Spin oza, and Newton. Now, we have seen that Shelley was reading these authors during the period of 1810-1813. In a letter to Elizabeth Hitchener, June 20, 1811, is the fol lowing sentence: All that natural reason enables us to discover is, that we now are, that there was a time when we were not. . . . But could we have arisen from nothing? The italicized portion of this letter corresponds almost verbatim with a sentence common to The Necessity of Atheism (1811), a Note in Queen Mab (1813), and On God (quoted above) : A man knows, not only that he now is, but there was a time when he c&amp;id not exist; consequently there must have been a cause.27 Another passage from On God comes from The Necessity of Atheism. The paragraphs beginning "until it is clearly found that the Universe was created. . . ." to the end of the next long paragraph were taken almost word for word from The Necessity of Atheism. These same paragraphs together with all the remaining ones were later used in The Refutation of Deism, and in a Note to Queen Mab. These facts seem to establish the date of On God as 1810 1813, and they indicate that it is not a separate work, but perhaps a portion of the early drafts of The Necessity of Atheism, or of the revision that became The Refutation of Deism, two years later. Speculations on Morals is a fragmentary treatise on the elementary principles of morals. According to Shelley: An action is termed moral which produces the highest pleasure to the greatest number of sensitive beings. . . . Moral science itself is the doctrine of the voluntary actions of man, as a sentient and social being. Laws are perfect or imperfect according as they do or not promote happiness, not merely the quantity of happiness, but its mode of distribution. The just claims of the individual must be con sidered. The disposition of an individual to promote happiness is 27See letters to Stockdale, August 1, 1811, December, 1811, and January 2, 1812.</page><page sequence="11">170 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays called virtue. Virtue is characterized by benevolence and justice; benevolence may be denned as the desire to do good; justice, the manner in which good is done. That is called good which produces pleasure; that is called evil which produces pain . . . pain is thus apprehended to be evil for its own sake . . . selfishness is the off spring of ignorance and mistake . . . disinterested benevolence is the product of a cultivated imagination. Moral science consists in con sidering the difference, not the resemblance, of persons. In the letters of 1810-13 the same ideas are set forth: How can the hope of a higher reward stimulating an action make it virtuous, if the essence of virtue is disinterested, as all those who know anything of virtue must allow. What does man exist for? Surely not for his own happiness, but as a more perfect instrument of that of others. . . . Surely one being is not obliged to another for a performance of his duty. We look around us ... we find that we exist, we find ourselves reasoning upon the mystery which involves our being ... we see virtue and vice . . . each is separate and distinct; . . . yet how rack ing it is to the soul, when enquiring into its own operations, to find that perfect virtue is very far from attainable, to find reason tainted by feeling, to see the mind when analysed exhibit a picture of irrecon ciled inconsistence, even when perhaps a moment before, it imagined that it had grasped the fleeting Phantom of Virtue.28 In a letter, October 26, 1811, justice and virtue are dis cussed; in that for November 12, 1811, virtue is said to be disinterested. In the letter for November 12, 1811, there is a passage identical in idea and similar in phrase to the Essay on Morals. Virtue . . . Friendship . . . that which seeks the good of all . . . desiring the happiness of others not for the obligation of fearing hell or desiring heaven, but for pure, simple unsophisticated Virtue. In the letters of November 20 and December 11, 1811, the ideas bear a close resemblance to those of the essay. In that for January 2, 1812, Shelley asserts that we must bear in mind that disinterestedness is the essence of virtuous motive. In that for January 28,1812, virtue and benevolence are discussed in the same general tone as in the essay, and Shelley concludes by saying that he will promote them. 28Letters, April 24, 1811; May, 1811, June 20, 1811.</page><page sequence="12">David Lee Clark 171 Shelley's essays which are known to have been composed in 1810-1813 contain many similarities in thought and phrase to The Speculations on Morals. In An Address to the Irish People (1812) we read: They will never have recourse to violence who acknowledge no other rule of behavour but virtue and justice ... we cannot believe just what we like, but only what we think to be true . . . never do evil that good may come . . . always think of others as well as your self. . . . Temperance, sobriety, charity, and independence will give you virtue. ... I repeat that virtue and wisdom are necessary to true happiness and liberty. ... It is vain to hope for any liberty and happiness without reason and virtue. ... A man cannot be truly wise who is not truly virtuous. . . . We must be contented to lay the foundation of liberty and happiness by virtue and wisdom. . . . In the Proposals for Associations we learn that "Virtue produces pleasure, it is as the cause to the effect. . . . Virtue . . . demands a voluntariness on the part of its devoted indi viduals, to sacrifice personal to public benefit. . . . The laws of his moral as of his physical nature are immutable. ... A man must have a right to do o thing before he can have a duty. . . . The essence of virtue is disinterestedness. In The Letter to Lord Ellenborough (1812) and in The Refutation of Deism, (1813) are many parallel passages.29 Compare the following: Refutation, "You seem to require mathematical demonstration in a case which admits no more than strong moral probability." Specu lation on Morals, Shepherd, 2:202: If a man persists to inquire why he ought to promote the happiness of mankind, he demands a mathemat ical or metaphysical reason for a moral action." Since this specific statement appears in essays known to have been written in 1812 and 1813, it is reasonable to conclude that its appearance in Speculations on Morals would suggest that Speculations was also written during that period, the thought and phrasing being then present in his mind. These excerpts indicate how much the ideas of virtue, benevolence, and justice were in Shelley's mind in ^29See An Address to the Irish People, Shepherd 1:293; 2:380, and pp. 242, 244, 248, 258. See Proposals, Shepherd 1:275, 277.</page><page sequence="13">172 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays 1810-1813. The source of Shelley's ideas on morals was un doubtedly Reid's and Hume's essays on morals, and not as commonly supposed, Godwin's Political Justice. An ex amination of the fundamental ideas will prove this state ment. Shelley, like Reid, believed that morals might be treated as a science, and definite conclusions reached through a rational investigation. In this latter concept, he is following Reid rather than Hume. A few quotations from Shelley and from Hume and Reid will, I believe, show this to be so: Shelley: Morality will be considered as a science, respecting which we can arrive at positive conclusions. . . . Moral science itself is the doctrine of the voluntary action of man, as a sentient and social being. . . . A virtuous action is that action which ... is fitted to produce the highest pleasure to the greatest number of sensitive beings. . . . The two constituent parts of virtue [are] benevolence and justice . . . [which] result from the elementary laws of the human mind . . . that is called good which produces pleasure; that is called evil which produces pain. . . . Duty is obligation. There can be no obligation without an obliger. . . . Selfishness is the offspring of ignorance and mistake . . . disinterested benevolence is the product of a cultivated imagination. . . . Virtue is thus entirely a refinement of civilized life . . . Man is capable of desirng and pursuing good for its own sake. The benevolent propensities are thus interest in the human mind. We are impelled to seek the happiness of others . . . there is a sentiment in the human mind that regulates benevolence ... as a principle of action. Justice, as well as benevolence, is an elementary law of human nature. (Shepherd 2:194-207). Hume (references are to the Green and Grose edition) : It is impossible that the distinction between moral good and evil can be made by reason (2:17). Vice and Virtue are not discoverable merely by reason ... it must be by means of some impression or sentiment . . . morality, therefore, is more frequently felt than judged of (2:179). A virtuous motive is required to render an action vir tuous (2:185). A regard to the interests of mankind cannot be the original motive of justice (2:188). The ideas of justice can never ... be taken for a natural principle, capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards each other. Virtue, as now understood, would never have been dreamed of among rude and savage men (2:194). Justice takes its rise from human conventions . . . increase to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men . . . and you render</page><page sequence="14">David Lee Clark 173 justice useless (2:199). The -sense of justice is not founded on reason or the discovery of certain connections and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and universally obligatory . . . the sense of justice, therefore, is not founded on our ideas, but on our impressions (2:200-201). All morality depends upon our sentiments ... we can naturally no more change our own sentiments than the motions of the heavens (2:220). A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obliga tion (2:221). No action can be either morally good or evil, unless there be some natural passion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it (2:233). As to free will, we have shown that it has no place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities, of men (2:302). Man is a reasonable being. . . . Man is a sociable being. . . . Man is an active being (2:6). Thus it appears . . . that the conjunction be tween motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform, as that between cause and effect in any part of nature (2:72). Public utility is the sole origin of Justice (2:179). It is evident, then, that Hume's principles of morals have no basis in metaphysics or in reason, but are grounded mainly in the passions, laying great stress on the power of sympathy. In this position Hume is in rebellion against the so-called intellectual school that maintained that the principles of morals can be deduced from observable data, by the process of noting the agreement or disagreement of ideas. Locke himself maintained as much. This seems to reduce morality merely to the mechanical reaction to pleas ure and pain. It cannot be denied that Hume, at times, leans toward this psychology, proclaiming that the test of virtue lies in its power to produce pleasure, and vice to produce pain. The contradiction is only apparent, how ever, for Hume limits the application of this theory to particular pleasure or pain. Thomas Reid (all references are to the Sir William Ham ilton edition of Essays on the Intellectual and the Active Powers of Man (1880, two volumes)) : Morals, like all other sciences must have first principles, on which all moral reasoning is grounded, 1:637. Conscience which is in every man's breast, is the law of God written in his heart (638). They [principles of conduct] may ... be compared to the laws of the mo tion in the natural world . . . they appear most august when we take a comprehensive view of their application to every condition and rela tion, and to every transaction of human society. This is . . . the de sign of systems of morals.

They saw no need for deductions of reasoning . . . sub sequent . . . writers gave method and arrangement to moral truths . . . and from this arrangement [it] gets the name of a system and of a science (1:642). All right supposes a corresponding duty . . . there can be no right in one party without a corresponding duty in another (1:643). Moral duty had long been considered as a law of Nature; a law, not written on tables of stone or brass, but on the heart of man (1:645). To know what is right and what is wrong in human conduct, we need only listen to the dictates of our conscience (1:646). Nothing is more evident than that an action does not merit the name of benevolent, unless it be done from a belief that tends to promote the good of our neighbor (1:648). Agreeableness and utility are not moral conceptions (1:651). If Virtue and Vice be a matter of choice, they must consist in voluntary actions (1:653). Men have no conception of the virtue of justice till they have lived some time in Society (1:653). [Man] is a voluntary agent (1:558). A comparison will show that Shelley has borrowed from both Hume and Reid. The general tone and number of specific ideas, such as that sentiment plays a large role in morality, may derive from the former; but it will be readily seen that in its broad outlines Shelley's principles of morals have closer affinities with Reid's ideas. Both Hume and Reid built their systems of morals on benevolence and jus tice, with virtue as the mainspring. Shelley follows in their path. But it was Reid who convinced Shelley that morals, being based on principles, is a science and thus its funda mental tenets could be deduced by reason. With Reid, too, he assigns a definite role to conscience. It should be pointed out here that Shelley ordered the works of Reid in 1812. Speculations on Metaphysics is also fragmentary. It is an examination into the nature of mind. Shelley declared that: Thought and sensation are the boundary of the mind; that we can think of nothing which we have not perceived; that thoughts have existence; that thought or ideas differ not in kind but in force; that a specific difference between every thought of the mind is, indeed, a necessary consequence of that law by which it perceives diversity and number . . . the principle of the agreement and similarity of all thoughts, is, that they are all thoughts; the principle of their disagree ment consists in the variety and irregularity of the occasions on which they arise in the mind.</page><page sequence="16">David Lee Clark 175 We are intuitively conscious of our own existence . . . that we are conscious also of the existence of other minds; but not intuitively . . . Mind cannot be considered pure. Then follow the remaining four sections: (1) On the nature of metaphysics, (2) On the difficulty of analyzing the human mind, (3) How the analysis should be carried on, (4) On Dreams. Shelley points out that It is said that mind produces motion; and it might as well be said, that motion produces mind. Man is a moral, an intellectual and pre emiently an imaginative being. ... It imports little to inquire whether thought be distinct from the objects of thought,?such dis tinctions seem an affair of words.30 The letters of this period are concerned with metaphysics. We learn from his letter to Godwin, June 3, 1812, that Shelley "read Locke, Hume, Reid, and whatever Meta physics came in my way," and from the Letter to Lord Ellenborough (spring of 1812) that "the agreement or disagreement of ideas" is the test or truth as of belief. Then, too, the poet ordered a number of metaphysical works from his bookseller, December 17, 1812, and in a letter to Godwin, February 24, 1812, Shelley asserted that his publications "will present to the moralist and meta physician a picture of a mind . . . which had . . . taken a singular turn." The essays composed in 1810-1813, are concerned pri marily with metaphysical and moral questions. It is a significant fact that during this period Shelley was philoso phyzing on the nature of Being and on the evidence of the senses. He hit upon what he conceived to be a positive measure or test of the senses. In a Note to Queen Mab (VII :13), Shelley had written (1813) : "a graduated scale, on which should be marked the capabilities of a proposi tion to approach to the test of the senses, would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them." In The Refutation of Deism (1813) those same words appear, with a colon after the word them and the following words added: "and but for the influence of 30Shepherd 2:186-193.</page><page sequence="17">176 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays prejudice or ignorance this invariably is the measure of belief." In Speculations of Metaphysics, this sentence has become: A scale might be formed, graduated according to the decrees of a combined ratio of intensity, duration, connexion, periods of recur rence, and utility, which would be the standard, according to which all ideas might be measured, and an uninterrupted chain of nicely shadowed distinctions would be observed, from the faintest impression on the senses, to the most distinct combination of those impressions; for the simplest of those combinations, to that mass of knowledge which, including our own nature, constitutes what we call the uni verse.31 This has the appearance of being a later and more thoughtful statement, but the fact that the words intensity, duration, connexion, recurrence, and utility had been gar nered from his reading in 1810-13 in Reid, Locke, and Hume, would therefore seem to indicate an early date of composition. We have seen that Shelley had read Locke, Hume, Reid, and other metaphysicians before June 3, 1812. His leading ideas in Speculations on Metaphysics may be found in these three authors?sometimes in phrase ology so close that one can hardly think it accidental. Here are a few parallels: Shelley: We can think of nothing which we have not perceived. . . . We can think of nothing. . . . we can imagine nothing, we can reason of nothing, we can foresee nothing. Hume: All our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions, or in other words. ... it is impossible for us to think of any thing, which we have not antecedently felt, either by our internal or external senses (2:51). Philosophy teaches us that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception (2:124-125). Shelley: The most astonishing combinations of poetry, the subtlest deductions of logic and mathematics, are no other than combinations which the intellect makes of sensations accord ing to its own laws. Hume: All this creative power of the mind amounts to is no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, "Shepherd 2:188.</page><page sequence="18">David Lee Clark 177 or diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience (2:14). Beyond the limit of perception and thought nothing can exist. ... By considering all knowledge as bounded by per ception. . . . But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall find, upon nearer examination, that it is confined within very narrow limits . . . We cannot go be yond experience (2:14). The simple ideas we receive from Sensation and Reflection are the bounderies of our thoughts, beyond which, the Mind ... is not able to advance one Jot (1:265). That we have no knowledge farther than we can have Percep tion of that agreement or disagreement (2:138). Paragraph three of the essay shows that Shelley leans on Hume, Reid, and Berkeley for his terminology. Shelley says: "thoughts, or ideas, or notions, call them what you will, differ from each other, not in kind but in force." Hume remarks: "All perceptions of the human mind resolve them selves into two distinct kinds . . . impressions and ideas. The difference betwixt these consists in the degree and liveliness.,, And, of course, Berkeley's famous doctrine of notions needs no exposition here. Reid (1:403) explains in great detail the word notions as a term for general con cepts. Toward the end of the paragraph, Shelley returns to his oft-repeated definition of knowledge as a perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas?a definition which he first, perhaps, encountered in Locke and later in Berkeley, Hume, and Reid. The next paragraph, as pointed out p. 171 above, is found almost verbatim in the Letter to Lord Ellenborough (1812), Refutation of Deism, (1813), and a Note to Queen Mob (1813). The suggestion for the thought of this paragraph Shelley could have found in Reid (1:488), where he deals with Hume's scepticism about reason. In the paragraph beginning "We are intuitively con scious," Shelley writes: Shelley: We are intuitively conscious of our own existence, and of that connexion in the train of our successive ideas, which Shelley: Hume: Locke:</page><page sequence="19">178 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays we term our identity. We are conscious also of the exis tence of other minds, but not intuitively. [That] is founded upon a very complicated relation of ideas. . . . Locke: (2:177) We have an intuitive knowledge of our own Existence. ... Of the Existence of anything else, we have no other but a sensitive knowledge, which extends not be yond the objects present to our senses. Berkeley: I know what I mean by terms / and myself; and I know this immediately, or intuitively. Reid: Every man has an immediate and irresistible conviction, not only of his present existence, but of his continued existence and identity. This reflection is a kind of intuition. The next section of the essay on Metaphysics concludes with the remark, evidently suggested by Locke: Shelley: It is said that mind produces motion; and it might have as well been said, that motion produces mind. Locke: (2:249) . . . Voluntary Motions, which are produced in us only by the free action or thought of our mind. . . . My right hand writes, whilst my left hand is still: What causes Rest in one, and Motion in the other? Nothing but my Will, a Thought of my Mind. . . . Explain this, and make it intelligible, and then the next step will be to understand creation. Reid: (2:526) We have good reason to believe that matter had its origin from mind, as well as all its motions. Shelley's statement that most errors of philosophers de rive from their consideration of the mind of man in a too narrow point of view and that to correct this, the philos opher must view man not only as a moral and an intel lectual being?"but also, and pre-eminently an Imagina tive being/' stems directly from Hume's exaltation of the imagination. A careful consideration of these parallels from authors Shelley testifies that he read in 1810-1813 leads almost certainly to the conclusion that Shelley wrote his Specula tion on Metaphysics during those years in which he was under the spell of Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid. In a letter to Hogg on March 16, 1814, Shelley wrote: "I have begun to learn Italian again. I am reading Bee</page><page sequence="20">David Lee Clark 179 caria, Dei delitti e pence/'32 Shelley remarks: "I do not think that it deserves the reputation it has gained." An examination will show that Shelley derived nothing from Beccaria for his essay, The Punishment of Death, for his own ideas on the subject were in advance of Beccaria, as seen in his early known publications, particularly from An Address to the Irish People, Proposals for an Association, Letter to Lord Ellenborough, all of 1812. But upon the fact that he was reading Beccaria, Ingpen and Rossetti dated the essay as 1814 and 1815, respectively. In the essay, Shelley calls for the abolition of capital punishment, because the effect upon the spectators, usually one of sympathy, defeats the purpose in mind, for it brutalizes both the criminal and the spectators, and be cause it does not deter others from committing similar crimes. The most civilized nations, he observed, have mild penal codes and thus have fewer crimes. The essay for the most part is devoted to a discussion of the nature of death. Shelley inquires what Death is; whether it is good or evil, a punishment or a reward. He says: That that within us which thinks and feels, continues to think and feel after the dissolution of the body, has been the almost universal opinion of mankind, and the accurate philosophy of . . . the modern Academy, by showing the prodigious depth and extent of our ig norance respecting the causes and nature of sensation, renders prob able the affirmative of a proposition, the negative of which it is so difficult to conceive, and the popular arguments against which, de rived from what is called the atomic system, are proved to be applica ble only to the relation which one object bears to another, as appre hended by the mind, and not to existence itself. . . . The popular system of religion suggests the idea that the mind, after death, will be painfully or pleasurably affected according to its determinations during life?[It seems that nature is] tending ... to some definite mighty end, to which the agencies of our peculiar nature are sub ordinate; now is there any reason to suppose, that in a future state they should become exempt from that subordination. The philosopher is unable to determine whether our existence in a previous state has 320n Crimes and Punishment, by Cesare Marchese de Beccaria (1735-1794) whose essay, published in 1764, had made a profound impression throughout Europe.</page><page sequence="21">180 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays affected our present condition, and abstains from deciding whether our present condition would affect us in that which may be future. . . . The opinion that the vital principle within us, in whatever mode it may continue to exist, must lose that consciousness of definite and individual being which now characterizes it, and become a unit in the vast sum of action and of though which disposes and animates the universe, and is called God, seems to belong to that class of opinion which has been designated as indifferent. The letters of 1810-1813 show that Shelley was medi tating upon the nature of crime, punishment, and death. In a letter to Hogg on January 3, 1811, Shelley refers to God as the soul of the universe, the actuating principle (in the essay: "The vast sum of action and of thought, which disposes and animates.'') Three days later he re peats the same idea, and in similar language, to Hogg. In a letter to Elizabeth Hitchener, June 20, 1811, we read: "Neither will soul perish; that in a future existence it will lose consciousness of having formerly lived elsewhere?will begin life anew, possibly under a shape of which we have now no idea." Note the close similarity of this to the sen tences, in the essay, beginning "the philosopher is unable," to the end. In a letter to Miss Hitchener, June 25, Shelley discusses at length the question of the immortality of mind, arguing that in sleep, the brother of Death, the mind is only suspended, "how contrary then to all analogy to infer annihilation from Death, which you cannot prove suspends for a moment the force of mind." On June 27 to Hogg, Shelley says: "I have been thinking of Death and Heaven for four days ... Is there a future life?" Throughout the summer and fall, this discussion with Hogg and Elizabeth Hitchener continues. On August 1, he informs his pub lisher Stockdale that he was "engaged in completing a series of moral and metaphysical essays." On August 19, Shelley writes to Elizabeth Hitchener, "Soul may be proved to be not that which changes its first principles in every new recipient, but an elementary essence . . . ." For further dis cussion of death and the nature of mind see especially letters for October 10, 12; November 12, 23, 24, 26; December 11, 1811; and January 2,1812.</page><page sequence="22">David Lee Clark 181 The close resemblances in thought and phrase between these letters and the essay lead to the conclusion that the letters and the essay were contemporaneous. An examina tion of the essays, and other productions known to have been written in this period bears out this conclusion. Note, for instance, Chapter XVI and XVII of Zastrozzi (1810), and in Chapters I, III, and X of St. Irvyne (1811) where discussions about a future state, of the existence of a Deity and of Death, are couched in terms quite similar to those in the essay on Punishment of Death. On a Future State is one of the most significant of Shel ley's essays. In it he tries to formulate some reasonable idea on the ever-recurring question of the immortality of the soul. He opens his inquiry in a thoroughly logical way by stating the two prevailing philosophies on the subject. It has been the general persuasion of mankind, he points out, that we continue to exist after death but not merely an existence as serted by some philosophers, that which is predicated upon the indestructibility of matter; but rather that which main tains that sensibility and thought, or that which animates the body, "will remain perpetual and unchanged." "Some philosophers," Shelley observes, "suppose, on the other hand, that intelligence is the mere result of certain combi nations among the particles of its objects." After hav ing posed the query, he brushes aside the question of a future state of rewards and punishment as foreign to the subject under consideration. Then follows a para graph on the meaning and significance of death. All we know of death is that we can no longer move, or feel, or see; that the component parts of the body are dissolved and scattered abroad. This is a melancholy view, which man is not willing to accept. But the natural philosopher believes that he sees with certainty that death is attended with annihilation of not only the body but of sentiment and thought as well. He sees the mental powers increase and fade with those of the body; in old age the mind withers; madness or insanity may utterly extinguish the powers of the mind; and sleep suspends the intellectual principle. This is convincing proof, he thinks, for believing that when</page><page sequence="23">182 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays the body perishes the mind or soul will also perish. The natural philosopher also believes that thought is probably no more than the relation between particles of matter, of which the rest of the universe is composed, and which ceases to exist when the parts change their position. Thus color, sound, taste, and odor exist only relatively. Even if thought be considered some peculiar substance, like elec tricity, light or magnetism, and is the cause of all anima tion, there is no reason to think that it will not be subject to natural law and perish. Shelley then turns to the question of existence of the soul before birth. "Have we existed before birth?" He doubts it. There is a generative principle in each plant or animal which converts the substance by which it is sur rounded into a substance homogeneous with itself. This com bination constitutes the being of a plant or animal. Did these particles of which it composed think or feel or see or hear before the combination took place? Does it reason or imagine or apprehend before sensations or ideas were impressed upon it? Shelley concludes from this data that "So far as thought and life is concerned, the same will take place . . . after death, as had place before our birth." He remarks that is has been said that "it is possible that we should continue to exist in some mode totally inconceivable to us at present. This is a most unreasonable presumption." Shelley reaches this final conclusion: "This desire to be for ever as we are; the reluctance to a violent and unexperi enced change ... is, indeed, the secret persuasion which has given birth to the opinions of a future state." During the whole of 1811 Shelley carried on a debate with Elizabeth Hitchener and Thomas Jefferson Hogg on the question of death and a future state. Almost every letter to them raises the main issues as stated in the essay. A few excerpts from his letters will show how true this is: The word God implies "the soul of the universe, the intelligent and necessarily beneficent, actuating principle . . . that . . . animates infinity. If we disbelieve this, the strongest argument in support of the existence of a future state instantly becomes annihilated (Janu ary 3, 1811). The loveliness of the flower ceases to charm. Surely</page><page sequence="24">David Lee Clark 183 it would be irrational to annex to this inertness the properties which the flower in its state of beauty possessed, which now cease to exist, and then did merely exist, because adjoined to it (June 2, 1811). When we speak of the soul of man, we mean that unknown cause which produces the observable effect evinced by his intelligence and bodily animation, which are in their nature conjoined, and ... in separable (June 11, 1811). Your Christianity . . . promises a future state, which otherwise were a matter at least of doubt. Let us con sider. . . . All that natural reason enables us to discover, is that we now are, that there was a time when we were not . . . could we have arisen from nothing? We put an acorn into the ground. In process of time it modifies the particles of earth, air, and water by infinitesimal division so as to produce an oak. That power which makes it to be this oak, we may call its vegetable principle, symbolis ing with the animal principle, or the soul of animated existence. The oak . . . ceases to be what it is; its soul is gone. Is then soul annihi lated? Yet one of the properties of animal soul is consciousness of identity. If this be destroyed, in consequence the soul . . . must per ish. But as I conceive . . . that nothing can be annihilated, but that everything appertaining to nature, consisting of constituent parts infinitely divisible, is in a continual change, then do I suppose . . .. that neither will soul perish; that in a future existence it will lose all consciousness of having formerly lived elsewhere, will begin life anew, possibly under a shape of which we have now no idea (June 20, 1811). You are convinced that there are no innate ideas, and that you do not always think when asleep. ... In these moments of intellectual suspension do you suppose that the soul is annihilated? You cannot suppose it, knowing the infallibility of the rule, From nothing, nothing can come; to nothing, nothing can return, as, by this rule, it could not be annihilated, or if annihilated could not be capa ble of resuscitation. . . . Those around the lifeless corpse are per fectly aware that it thinks not; at least they are aware that when scattered through all the changes which matter undergoes, it cannot then think. You have witnessed one suspension of intellect in dream less sleep . . . you witness another in Death. From the first, you well know that you cannot infer any diminution of intellectual force. How contrary then to all analogy to infer annihilation from Death, which you cannot prove suspends for a moment the force of mind (June 25, 1811). I have been thinking of Death and Heaven for four days. ... Is there a future life? (June 27, 1811). How mutually dependent on each other are mind and body (July 15, 1811). [I am at present engaged in completing a series of moral and metaphysical essays, August 1, 1811.] Soul may be proved to be, not that which changes its first principles in every new recipient, but an elementary essence, an essence of first principles which bears the mark of casual [or] intended impressions. . . . The non-existence of innate ideas is</page><page sequence="25">184 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays proved by Locke . . . this is conclusive. If no ideas are innate, then all ideas must take their origin subsequent to the transfusion of the soul (August 19, 1811). You talk of a future state . . . what we earnestly desire we are very much prejudiced in favor of. It seems to me that everything lives again. What is the soul? Look at yonder flower. The blast of the North sweeps it from the earth . . . yet that flower hath a soul; for what is soul but that which makes an organized being to be what it is. ... I will say, then, that all Nature is ani mated . . . [may we not] find that Nature itself was but a mass of organized animation. Perhaps the animative intellect of all this is in a constant rotation of change, perhaps a future state is no other than a different mode of terrestial existence to which we have fitted our selves in this mode (November 24, 1811). Might there not have been a prior state of existence? . . . The creation of soul at birth is a thing I do not like (November 26, 1811). Every day makes me feel more keenly that our being is eternal. Every day brings the convic tion how futile, how inadequate, are all reasonings to demonstrate it . . . yet the eternity of man has ever been believed (December 11, 1811). [I am composing some essays which I design to publish in the summer (letter, December 26, 1811).] Certainly these letters of 1811, quoted above, prove that Shelley's mind was deeply and almost continually engaged with the question of a future state. Furthermore the letters of no other period in his life are so concerned. Since this is so and since he more than once tells us in these letters that he is writing metaphysical, moral, and religious es says during this period, is it not reasonable to conclude that the essays under discussion are those referred to in his letters ? He who would deny it must assume the burden of the proof. An additional proof of my conclusion may be sought in the other literary productions of this period. In Chapter XVI of Zastrozzi (1810) we read: "She thought upon the future state?she thought upon the arguments of Zastrozzi against the existence of a Deity . . . Her hopes of salvation were great, and her belief in God and a future state firm . . . ." And in the next chapter, "I intend to meet death, to encounter annihilation, with tranquillity. Am I not con vinced of the non-existence of a Deity? Am I not convinced that death will but render this soul more free?" In St. Irvyne (1811), Chapter III, is a closer parallel in thought</page><page sequence="26">David Lee Clark 185 and phrase: . . Soul which must endure till the intel lectual particles which compose it become annihilated . . . then will we seek each other, and, in eternal, indivisible, although immaterial union, shall we exist to all eternity." And in Chapter X, in which Shelley, under the thin dis guise of his hero Ginotti, narrates his own life, we learn that he was early a materialist. Compare this with a simi lar statement in his Essay on Life, how he had become con vinced of a God and of the immortality of the soul. The passage is too long to quote here. In The Refutation of Deism (written, I believe, 1813) there is a striking passage on the nature of thought, which parallels closely a passage in the essay; it reads: "Matter ... is not inert. It is in finitely active and subtile. Light, electricity, and magnet ism are fluids not surpassed by thought itself in tenuity and activity; like thought they are sometimes the cause and sometimes the effect of motion; and, distinct as they are from every other class of substances with which we are acquainted, seem to posses equal claims with thought to the unmeaning distinction of immateriality. The laws of motion and the properties of matter . . . account for every phenomenon ... in the Universe." That this conception of the nature of thought has taken hold of Shelley may be seen by comparing this passage with a passage in the fifth para graph of the essay, that beginning, "It is probable what we call thought," to the end of the paragraph. The follow ing is particulary serviceable to our purpose: "But let thought be considered as some peculiar substance. ... It differs, indeed, from all other substances, as electricity, and light, and magnetism . . . severally differ from each other. Each of these is subject to change and decay, and conversion into other forms." In fact as one studies the arguments in The Refutation he is forced to the conclusion that the two are contemporaneous, and Shelley is endeavor ing at this period in his life to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion about the fundamental question of immortality, the nature of God, and of thought, or mind. His Queen Mab (1812-13), sections IV, VI, IX, and the Notes to these</page><page sequence="27">186 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays portions of the poem deal with essentially the same topics, and in very similar language. An examination of Shelley's reading during this period lends further proof of the theory that the essays were written at this time, for Shelley seldom hesitated to take whatever ideas he needed from the authors he was reading, sometimes with his indebtedness definitely stated as in the Notes to Queen Mab, or The Refutation of Deism, and then without acknowledgment as in The Address to the Irish People, or Letter to Lord Ellenborough. Of the writers whom Shelley is known to have read during this period? Spinoza, Thomas Reid, Dugald Stewart, and David Hume? express themselves at length on the immortality of the soul or a future state. Though Shelley read Spinoza throughout his life, and went so far as to translate the Tractatus, one suspects that he did not fully comprehend the ethical and spiritual import of Spinoza's teachings. Like Spinoza, Shelley identified God and Nature, and Mind and Thought, but unlike Spinoza he did not seem to see the metaphysical significance of so thinking. Superficially viewed, Spinoza denied the immortality of the soul, and asserted that it must perish with the body. But actually Spinoza believed that the Mind or Soul cannot be abso lutely destroyed with the body, that some part of it remains eternal. This idea, . . . which expresses under a certain species of eternity the essence of the body is a certain mode of thought which apper tains to the essence of the mind and which is necessarily eternal. It cannot happen, however, that we can remember that we existed before our bodies . . . neither can eternity be defined by time nor have any relation to time. But nevertheless we feel and know that we are eternal. (Ethics, Everyman, pp. 213-214.) Shelley read in Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind, (I: 202-311,) that it has been a common belief among mankind that the soul is "some subtile matter, like breath or wind." Reid states the ideas of both ancients and mod erns as to the nature and the mortality or immortality of the soul. Both Dugald Stewart and David Hume whom Shelley had recently read wrote essays on the subject.</page><page sequence="28">David Lee Clark 187 Chapter IV of Stewart's Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers of Man, (2:161-218,) is entitled Of a Future State. The following statements from it are pertinent to our inquiry. In stating the argument for a future state derived from the nature of mind, Stewart asserts that After having* proved, or attempted to prove, that it [the soul] has no quality in common with Matter . . . that it is not extended or divisible, the advocates for this opinion have concluded . . . that what is not compounded nor made up of parts cannot be dissolved, and, therefore, that the human soul is essentially and necessarily immortal. . . . But this argument . . . proves too much; for it concludes as strongly against the possibility of the soul's being created as dis solved ... all the ancient philosophers who believed in a future state maintained also the doctrine of the soul's pre-existence. . . . When we consider, however, with attention the argument from the Soul's Immateriality in favour of its Immortality, it appears by no means conclusive . . . we have no direct evidence of this principle [the soul] exercising its various faculties and powers in a separate state from the body ... we know, too, from what happens in consequence of intoxication, madness, and other diseases, that a certain condition of the body is necessary to the intellectual operations. And the same thing appears from the gradual decay of the faculties as we approach to old age . . . that the body and mind seem to decay together. . . . But they surely do not amount to a proof that the soul is necessarily extinguished when the body is dissolved. Stewart then explains Dr. Priestley's argument for the immateriality of the soul and of the extinction of the thinking principle with the dissolution of the body. Shelley had no doubt read Priestley, but Stewart's statement alone could have furnished him with the idea expressed in the first paragraph that according to some philosophers, those grounded in the physical sciences, intelligence is the mere combination of particles of matter. "What, then, shall we suppose happens at death? . . . death only lifts up the veil which conceals from our mortal eyes the invisible world. Death does not extinguish mind. ... On the con trary, death annihilates the material universe to our senses, and prepares our minds for some new and unknown state of being." Having presented the arguments for immor tality from the analogy of nature, an argument which Shel ley uses in another connection, Stewart then turns to the</page><page sequence="29">188 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays moral evidences for a future state: the natural desire of immortality, which Shelley echoes in the last paragraph of his essay, and finally he says, "Why were we furnished with powers which range through the infinity of space and time, if our lot is to be the same with that of the beasts which perish?" Shelley, it will be noted, made use of this exact argument. Hume's two essays, that on The Immortality of the Soul and that on A Particular Providence and a Future State, Shelley most certainly knew, and with almost equal cer tainty drew upon them heavily for one or more of his meta physical and religious essays. Like Stewart, Hume bases his argument for immortality of the soul upon metaphysical, moral, and physical grounds, but in reality, he says, it was the Bible and the Bible alone that brought the idea of immor tality to the fore, and is thus the only "proof" of it. Com pare the last two paragraphs of Shelley's The Refutation. It was Hume and not Reid, or Stewart, who shed a color ing of agnosticism over Shelley's essay. It was likely Hume who taught Shelley the metaphysical doctrine that matter and soul alike are unknown and unknowable. Said Hume: But, admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe . . . and to be the only inherent subject of thought we have reason to conclude from analogy, that nature uses it after the manner she does the other substance, matter. She employs it as a kind of paste or clay; modifies it into a variety of forms and existences; dis solves after a time each modification, and from its substance erects a new form . . . Reasoning from the course of nature, . . . the soul, therefore, if immortal, existed before our birth. Hume dismisses the moral argument, involving the idea of a future of rewards and punishment, as silly; but physical arguments, from the analogy of nature, lead almost cer tainly to the conclusion that the soul will perish with the body. The soul is suspended in sleep; the body and mind are weak in infancy; are vigorous in middle age; and gradu ally decay together in old age; and finally their common dissolution in death. Hume concludes with a statement which is everywhere in Shelley: "Nothing in the world is perpetual; everything ... is in continual flux and change."</page><page sequence="30">David Lee Clark 189 I have gone into the subject of death, a future state, the immortality of the soul, at some length, because the ques tion was one which dominated Shelley's thinking through out his life. Thus it seemed advisable to arrive at a just notion of his philosophy during the formative years of his life. Closely related to the Essay on a Future State is that On Life. The resemblances in phrase and thought are strikingly similar. The essay begins with this statement: "Life and the world, or . . . that which we are and feel ... is the great miracle . . . How vain is it to think that words can penetrate the mystery of our being!" Shel ley then asserts that he agrees with those philosophers who maintain that nothing exists but as it is perceived. It is hard to believe, he says, that this solid universe of external things is "such stuff as dreams are made of." The popular philosophy of mind and matter, its fatal consequences in morals, and its dogmatism "had early conducted me to materialism. This materialism is a seducing system to young and superficial minds." Shelley was discontented with this view, for his inner self told him that man is a being of high aspirations, "looking both before and after," whose "thoughts wander through eternity," disclaiming alliance with transience and decay, whose spirit is at en mity with nothingness and dissolution. The most clear and vigorous statement of the Intellectual System, he says, is found in Sir William Drummond's Academical Questions. However irrefutable, this philosophy does not satisfy the human heart or the mind?it leaves a vacancy. We are told that feelings and reasonings are but "the result of a multi tude of entangled thoughts and of a series of what are called impressions, planted by reiteration . . . "that noth ing exists but as it is perceived." The difference between ideas and external objects is only nominal; even the exist ence of mind itself is persaps only a delusion; the words I, you, they do not denote any actual different modifications of the one mind. It is difficult to find words to express so subtle a conception as this to which the Intellectual Philosophy has led us. What is the cause of life? "All recorded genera</page><page sequence="31">190 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays tions of mankind have wearily busied themselves in in venting answers to this question; and the result has been ?Religion." But the basis of all things cannot be, as the popular philosophy alleges, Mind. "For mind cannot create, it can only perceive; and it is highly improbable that the cause of mind, that is of existence, is similar to mind." That is a rough paraphrase of the essay; let us now examine the letters of 1810-1813 for the ideas contained in the essay. "I have long been convinced of the eventual omnipotence of mind over matter," (October 12, 1811?). "Every day makes me feel more keenly that our being is eternal . . . how inadequate are reasonings to demonstrate it," (December 11, 1811). "Words are only signs of ideas .... Southey agrees in my idea of Deity, the mass of infi nite intelligence ... I, you, and he, are constituent parts of this immense whole," (January 2, 1812). . . . "Immateri ality seems to me nothing but a simple denial of the pres ence of matter, of the presence of all the forms of being with which our senses are acquainted. ... I have read Berkeley, and the perusal of his arguments tended more than anything to convince me that immaterialism, and other words of general usage, deriving all their force from mere predicts in nonf were invented by the pride of philosophers to conceal their ignorance, even from them selves. . . . But words are merely signs of ideas. How many evils, and how great, spring from the annexing in adequate and improper ideas to words!" (July 29, 1812). An examination of other productions written by Shelley during this period will throw some light on the question of date. In Chapter X of St. Irvyne (1811) Shelley argues the same question of materialism and immaterialism, of the nature of matter, of his early crude materialism, and how philosophy had failed to answer his doubts, and how finally he came to the conclusion that God, the spirit of the universe, did exist, and in consequence the soul of man. The domi nant thought in the Essay on Life is that nothing exists but as it perceived and that "mind cannot create, it can only perceive." This philosophy Shelley apparently first found phrased for him in a sentence in the margin of a copy</page><page sequence="32">David Lee Clark 191 of the works of Berkeley lent to him by Charles Lloyd in the fall or winter of 1811 while the Shelleys were living in the Lake District. (See letter, September 27, 1819). Shelley made frequent use of that sentence; it assumes a special importance in The Refutation of Deism (1813). In fact the central thought of the last paragraph of the Essay on Life is found in Refutation (Shepherd, I, 327-328), with the passage beginning: "Mind cannot create, it can only perceive. ... It is evident, therefore, that mind deserves to be considered as the effect, rather than the cause of motion." Let us now turn to the reading which Shelley was doing during this period for possible sources for the ideas em bodied in the essay On Life. Shelley's conception of life as expressed in this essay is based upon his idea of the nature of mind or thought and the external world. With Berkeley he asserts that nothing exists but as it is perceived. Berkeley: "The existence of an idea consists in being per ceived. . . . All unthinking objects of the mind agree . . . Their existence consists only in being perceived. . . . The existence of an idea consists in being perceived. . . . When we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas. . . . All things that exist, exist only in the mind, that is, they are purely notional." In the essay On Life Shelley says, "I con fess that I am one of those who am unable to refuse my assent to the conclusion of those philosophers who assert that nothing exists but as it is perceived." So, it was the reading of Berkeley in the winter of 1811-12 that converted Shelley to immaterialism. The second philosophical prin ciple set forth in the essay is that mind cannot create, it can only perceive. Here, too, he is following Berkeley, but Shelley has doubts as to the truth of this statement, and leans toward the skepticism of Hume, who asserts in Dia logues Concerning Natural Religion: The author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man. . . . Experience, therefore, proves that there is an original principle of order in mind, not matter. . . . The causes, therefore, must be re sembling. . . . And will any man tell me with a serious countenance that an orderly universe must arise from some thought and art, like</page><page sequence="33">192 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays the human. . . ? To prove by experience the origin of the universe from mind is not more contrary to common speech than to prove the motion of the earth from the same principle, . . . What is the soul of man? A composition of various faculties, passions, sentiments, ideas; united, indeed, into one self or person, but still distinct from each other. When it reasons, the ideas . . . arrange themselves in a cer tain order; which is not preserved entire for a moment, but immedi ately give place to another arrangement. New opinions, new passions, new affections, new feelings arise, which continually diversity the mental scene. Hume, indeed, was sceptical as to thought or mind having the creative force which Berkeley assigned to it. In this dispute Shelley seems to side with Hume, who doubted man's ability to understand the nature of causation. Let us now examine the most important of the essays, the so-called Essay on Christianity and its related frag ments. The work is found, without title, in one of the manu script note-books, now in the Bodleian Library. It was first published by Lady Shelley in Shelley Memorials in 1859 as Essay on Christianity. It is my opinion that the Essay is an early draft of the Biblical Extracts, which Shelley is known to have composed, and sent to Hookham in 1812. We learn of Biblical Extracts first in a letter to Miss Hitchener, February 27, 1812, just after his first arrival in Ireland. He writes: "I have met with some waverers between Christianity and Deism. I shall attempt to make them reject all the bad, and take all the good, of the Jewish books. I have often thought that the moral sayings of Jesus Christ might be very useful, if selected from the mystery and immorality which surrounds them; it is a little work I have in contemplation." The "little work" was done by December 17, when he wrote to Hookham: "You will receive the 'Biblical Extracts' in a day or two." And on January 2, 1813, he was urging his publisher to hasten with the work, for "small Christmas or Easter offer ing of a neat little book have frequently a surprising effect." We hear no more of the Biblical Extracts. Hookham would hardly have dared to publish it as Christmas or Easter offerings, for there was too much dynamite in it. Now, the Essay is a compilation of eleven extracts from</page><page sequence="34">David Lee Clark 193 the moral teachings of Jesus. Each extract is followed by a commentary in which Shelley strips away "the mystery and immortality," and frequently bolsters up a statement by Jesus with substantiating evidence from some great philosopher. Clearly the Essay answers to a compilation of the sayings of Jesus, and not to an essay on Christianity. It is a curious fact that no one has apparently ever sus pected that the so-called Essay and the Biblical Extracts might be identical. In a forthcoming article of mine in Modern Language Notes, I give support to this theory by pointing out that the thought and phraseology of the letters and pamphlets of 1810-1813 closely parallel those of the Essay. Furthermore, in that article I endeavor to show that the ideas of the essay come more or less directly from the authors which Shelley was known to be reading during 1810-1813. It should be noted here that the Essay appears in a note-book which contains portions of other essays known to have been written in 1813. In conclusion we repeat that Shelley wrote during 1810 1813 a series of metaphysical, moral, and religious essays. We have seen that these were never published in his life time under that title, but that a number of essays on meta physical, moral, and religious subjects were later published from manuscripts he left. We maintain that the ideas set forth in these essays are to be found, and in similar lan guage, in the letters of 1810-1813. At no other period in his life was Shelley known to have been so engrossed in such subjects. Futhermore, we have seen that Shelley leaned heavily on writers like Locke, Berkeley, Drummond, Reid, Hume, and Spinoza for his ideas?writers he is known to have read during this period. It is a fact that Shelley was reading and appropriating ideas from these writers for other prose works of his known to have been written and published during 1810-1813. So, it seems reasonable to conclude that the metaphysical, moral, and religious essays composed during those years are identical with the prose essays published at various times and under various titles after the poet's death, and gener ally known as Prose Fragments. There is no logical or psy</page><page sequence="35">194 The Dates and Sources of Shelley's Essays chological reason, as there is no documentary evidence to assign them to any other period and certainly not to the period of 1815-1819, as has been generally done by Shelley scholars. The fact that Mary knew nothing about their date of composition and the further fact that no mention of them is made in the Journal of Shelley and Mary, or in the letters after 1814, and more importantly that the note books in which several of these essays appear contain es says known to have been written in the period from 1810 1813, together with all the other internal and circumstan tial evidence above, afford almost incontrovertible proof that the Prose Fragments were composed in 1810-1813. I repeat that if this theory herein set forth wins accept ance from Shelley scholars, a difficult problem in Shelley scholarship will have been solved, and instead of an abrupt break in the growth of the poet's mind, we have an orderly development and an understandable maturing of his ideas. There were not, then, two Shelleys as is so commonly as serted, but only one developing character.</page></plain_text>
