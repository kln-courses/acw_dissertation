<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONALD TRITSCHLER STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT, ALBANY, NEW YORK The Stories in Dylan Thomas' Red Notebook DYLAN THOMAS filled at least four copybooks with poetry and one, the "Red Notebook,"' with short stories by the time he was twenty. Though he had also written juvenilia that his mother carefu'lly pre- served,2 these five notebooks contain early and late versions of most of his published poems and nine of his published short stories. Ralph Maud's publication of the four poetry copybooks,3 which were nearly finished when Thomas began the Red Notebook, shows that he had already explored most of his major themes. 1 "The Red Notebook" is so catalogued by its owner, the Poetry Collection of the Lockwood Memorial Library, State University of New York at Buffalo. The previously unpublished material quoted here is Copyright @ by the Trustees for the Copyrights of Dylan Thomas, 1971. Both the Trustees and the library have kindly granted me permission to quote from it. The Note book is a 7 3/4 x 6-inch copybook with a soft, deep-red cover that declares it "The ZENITH Exercise Book," and it advertises "Ruled Feint Lines" (twenty-two) and provides spaces for the student's name and school and the date (all unfilled). The back cover lists six D ANGER ON'TS S AFETY FIRST about playing near vehicles. If the schoolboy survived this first spelling lesson, he found on the inside back cover "Arithmetical Tables," tables of measures, and multiplication tables. The sheets of the Notebook, which are stapled at the center fold of the book, are numbered 2 through 53 (1 and 54 having been removed or lost) in the center of the headspace on the right-hand pages only. Most of the pages are numbered by Thomas in pencil, though almost all the writing in the book is in ink on both sides of the sheets. The first sheet apparently has been torn out by Thomas, for the second begins with "the clouds;" inked out, "in" overwritten with "In" as the beginning of the sentence, and "The Tree (Adelphi)." penciled beneath the page number. 2 The juvenilia and copious worksheets of some later works went to the University of Texas Humanities Research Center with the T. E. Hanley collection. The British Museum holds additional worksheets and type- scripts of early poems; the Houghton Memorial Library at Harvard University holds the fourth major collection of manuscripts-copious worksheets of a few late poems. All four possess letters. 3Ralph N. Maud, ed., The Notebooks of Dylan Thomas (New Directions, 1967). 33</page><page sequence="2">34 DONALD TRITSCHLER The ten Notebook stories likewise contain comparisons of divine, human and artistic creation and Thomas' obsessive paradox of crea- tion as a destruction. They focus his sense of mankind's loss of inno- cence and love and the attendant ubiquity of evil and death in the world, and they present his criticism of the weak Christian religious practice that is unable to resolve the struggles of spirit and flesh. At least one of the stories was part of Thomas' first attempt to write a full- length novel. All of them seem to lie midway between the early poems and the later, more elaborate ones, perhaps because the time of com- position was usually slightly later than most of the early poems, or because the short story form is roomier than the brief lyric and it obviously approaches the ideal of narrative that Thomas sought in his later poetry. The Notebook itself is most interesting as a workbook. Several il- luminating jottings, tables of contents and lists on the inside cover and on some of the final pages throw light on Thomas' publishing plans.4 And because only one of the stories transcribed into it is unpublished, 4 The inside of the front cover provides a map of England. Its most striking entry is the words "The Birth," that Thomas penciled and framed with a rectangle between the Isle of Man and Northumberland. This may be a trial title, perhaps an alternative to "After the Fair," "The Visitor," or the unpublished "Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar," where births of one sort or another occur. The stories in the Notebook and additional titles are listed in the North Sea. "The Witch," "Arecom [scratched] Genesis," "The Manor" and "The Knife" are inked in a column. These titles are probably the first jottings, because an additional title, "The Diarists," is penciled below that list. Thomas mentioned this last story, in a Christmas (1932?) letter to Trevor Hughes, as one The London Mercury accepted but did not publish (Selected Letters of Dylan Thomas, ed. Constantine FigzGibbon [London: Dent, 1966], p. 8). A table of contents directly west of this one is entirely in pencil and is almost the same as the order of stories in the Red Notebook: + The Tree + Martha + Aftk The Fair + The Enemies +The Dress The Visitors. The Burning Baby The Vest Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar The two differences are that in the Notebook "The Burning Baby" follows "Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar" and that the unlisted story, "Anagram," appears last in the Notebook and eventually constitutes the central section of "The Orchards." The overleaf of sheet 53 also contains lists: three trials of a table of stories and a list headed by "Eighteen Poems." The next entry in this prospective list of "works" was originally "Ten Stories," the number in the Red Notebook, but the title of Thomas' next published book, "25 Poems" (Dent, 1936), has been inserted be- tween these two. The insertion may date the lists in the Notebook. The rest of the list tries various titles: "Three Essays" (deleted), "Two Plays" (deleted), "Twenty Poems," "Six Stories" (deleted?), "Three Essays" (deleted), and "One Story" (deleted). The three versions of a table of contents for a collection of short stories on this over- leaf not only show Thomas' uncertainty over what to include, but they indicate many other prose manuscripts were extant by this time.</page><page sequence="3">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 35 The ZENITH Exercise Book.</page><page sequence="4">36 DONALD TRITSCHLER the differences between the Notebook and the published versions re- veal much about Thomas' working methods and about the significance of the stories. The first story, "The Tree" ("Finished December 28. '33"), is included in each of the five tables of contents that are listed on the inside cover and the seven end pages of the Red Notebook. Its garden setting recalls the Creation-the gardener "knew every story from the beginning of the world"5-and the child's insistence on the specifics of the biblical stories leads him to recreate the Crucifixion. The boy's nature is imaginative and destructive, and his point of view, which can transform the lawn into a sea, the bushes into islands, birds into satanic omens, and the gardener into either a sinister figure or an "apostle," controls the structure of the story. The gardener himself views the biblical stories he tells the boy as examples of life and love in the earth. He is attuned to nature, a kind of minor deity of the microcosmic life in the garden, which is surrounded by the macrocosm of the Jarvis hills and the world they imply. He is aware of the fallen state of this world ("his god grew up like a tree from the apple-shaped earth"6), and he tells the boy, "God grows in strange trees" (p. 103). As a pantheist, he says, "Pray to a tree, thinking of Calvary and Eden" (p. 102- italics mine). In this exchange, however, the boy insists the tree in their garden, that he sees as the one tree free of snow, is "the first tree," but the gardener politely overlooks his presumption by saying, "The elder is as good as another" (p. 103). The Red Notebook presented this as The title of another elusive story, "An Uncommon Genesis," appears in most of these jotted tables. It was to be a short novel that Thomas began writing as early as 1932. He told Pamela Hansford Johnson it concerned "a man &amp; a woman. And the woman, of course, is not human" (Selected Letters, p. 38; see also pp. 42 and 49). Mrs. Annis Vilas Pratt thinks the novelette probably became "The Mouse and the Woman," which does not appear in any of the lists of titles-"The Early Prose of Dylan Thomas," Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Co- lumbia University, 1964, p. 16.) Other titles that appear somewhere in the Red Notebook but are not among its stories are: The End of the River The Horse's Ha The Map of Love Selmer The Tramp The Holy Six The Enemies United. 5 Dylan Thomas, Adventures in the Skin Trade (New Directions 1953), p. 98.

In both versions the gardener attempts to repair the tines of the rake with a wire, and the boy suddenly sees him as sinister. Then he notices the gardener's pure white beard and sees him as an apostle telling of the stages of the cross. While the boy listens, he sees the noon shadows as blood stain- ing the bark of the elder in their garden. The tree stands as the Tree of Life at the beginning of the story and becomes the Cross of Calvary at the end. The transformations of this tree trace the growth of metaphor in the boy's mind. When the gardener compares the tree to the Tree in the Garden, the boy extends the analogy to include Satan's entrance into Eden by interpreting a blackbird in the tree as "a monstrous hawk perched on a bough or an eagle swinging in the wind."7 After hearing of Bethlehem and confusing it with the Jarvis hills to the east, the boy falls into a cavernous sleep, in which he dreams of descending among the "shadows" of the house (corrected from the more explicit "shades," (p. 4a). After this descent into an underworld, he dreams of stepping into his own deceptive garden and of seeing his tree illumi- nated by a star burning brightly over it. The tree resembles a woman with frozen "arms" that bend "as to his touch," and now he kneels on its "blackened twigs" to pray (p. 100); "then, trembling with love and cold" (101 -italics mine), he returns to the house. The other aspect of "the illuminated tree" is evident when it appears leafless and black-deathly. Into this ambiguous setting the idiot enters on Christmas day, after the boy sees the star above the tree. When the idiot begs for water, his goodness is so evident that the people give him milk. When he simply says he is from the east, they trust him (p. 101). The next montage shot of the idiot shows him looking into the "immaculate" Jarvis valley. He hungers for light, which he tastes in the green life of the grass (p. 103). He is a brother to all things of the world, and he restores light to it; he believes he is entering Bethlehem as he answers the call of the world's voices in the Jarvis valley. The final episode of Christmas morning compares the idiot to Christ in His passion, which was included in the garderner's stories. He prays in the garden. Then its shapes seem hostile. The wind threatens, "raising a Jewish voice out of the elder boughs," and a voice within the idiot asks why he was 7 Skin Trade, p. 98. Cf. the "polar eagle" of "The Ballad of the Long-legged Bait."</page><page sequence="6">38 DONALD TRITSCHLER brought here, somewhat as Christ momentarily seemed to question God. When the boy finds him, he shows "divine patience" (p. 106), even as the boy wires his arms to the limbs of the tree and prepares to nail him to it. The use of the wire shows what the nai've boy has learned from his own sinister vision of the gardener repairing the rake; the child's insistence on the specifics of the gardener's stories has finally led him to the crucifixion of innocence and love. Though the parallels to the life of Christ are sketchy-the "birth" and crucifixion both occur on Christmas day-they provide a context in which the latent evil of an "apple-shaped earth" can work through a nai've boy to murder innocence. The justaposition of the "birth" and crucifixion points one more ironic comment at the excesses of man's religious zeal. The revisions of the Red Notebook version for publication are mainly routine retouches. There is almost no rearrangement, but many inci- dental changes reduce wordiness, and especially remove irrelevance and vagueness. Verbs are often strengthened by modifiers or by sub- stitution of more vivid words ("he bent" for "he went"). Thomas is usually more specific in the final version-"apples and serpents" (p. 98) replaces "the first sin" (p. 2b)-and he is thereby more expres- sive, as in the replacement of "a darkness" by the more womby "spinning cavern" (p. 99). Another type of revision is the temperance of extravagant words ("rushing" of the sap instead of "roaring"- p. 98) and the removal of many examples of pathetic fallacy. Never- theless, though the tower no longer "gave a benediction" (p. 8a), nature is animated in order to stress the force of life in the world that creates and cuts down its innocent children of love (p. 98). While "The Tree" contains oblique references to Christ, the next story in the Red Notebook, "The True Story" (January 22. '34), mentions various earthly visits to show its protagonist's nai'vet&amp;: Martha is proud of her reading, and she vaguely recalls the stories of Zeus and Danae, Satan's temptation of Eve, and Moses receiving God's commands from "a thing of fire" (p. 259). She thinks immediately of the dog she killed and buried under the manure at the end of the garden. That she wrote the epitaph and date backwards suggests "dog" is an inversion of god.8 Surely her service to the old woman is mistaken. Like the biblical Martha, she selfishly makes it unthinking busywork, rather than service 8 Four months later (11 May 1934) he despaired to Pamela Hasford Johnson, "All sentences fall when the weight of the mind is distributed unevenly along the holy consonants and vowels. In the beginning was a word I can't spell, not a reversed Dog, or a physical light,..." (Selected Letters, p. 127.)</page><page sequence="7">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 39 to her patient's being.9 At the end of her reveries, in which she has plotted the old woman's death, she characteristically parodies the burial service with "in the midst of death. . . ." (p. 260). During the exposition of the dull routine of service that Martha inherited from her mother, Martha associates the picking of currants with the money under the old woman's mattress. The next association is with the blood on her hands from chickens she has freshly killed. The first paragraph to focus on the present shows Martha's obsession with the fortune during this spring (which like Martha is "the undoer of winter,"-11 a) of her twentieth year. In the manuscript Thomas emphasized "blood money," which stained in the same way the cur- rants did (p. 10b). He may have removed this emphasis from the final version to avoid divulging the conclusion too quickly. Martha was surely more cold-blooded in the manuscript because her decision to murder was stated flatly and repeatedly. The published version startles the reader with her wish to fly in the window and suck the old woman's blood, her life's substance. The surprises that follow not only intensify the dreadful action, but the structure conveys the lack of values or feeling Martha's isolation fostered. The unfeeling combination of "One o'clock now, she said, and knocked the old woman's head against the wall"'o renders her fatal nai'vete exactly. The plot of "After the Fair" (November 19. '33) is simpler than those of the first two Red Notebook stories, and while their motivation is amoral, this plot develops from human kindness. The prospective tables of contents and Thomas' collections of his works he jotted in the Note- book show he did not think this one of his most important stories. Nor does he seem to have labored over it as much as he did some of the other stories because the manuscript version contains only a few, superficial, textual changes. The Fat Man's idea that the baby in the Astrologer's tent comes from looking at the stars is both humorous and significant; the girl's selection of the Fat Man to help her care for the 9 The Red Notebook shows Thomas considered dropping the name Martha, which was also the original title of the story. For some reason he scratched most appearances of "Martha" in the Notebook and penciled "Helen." In a letter to John Davenport (31 August 1938, according to Selected Letters, pp. 206-7), Thomas mentioned "'All Paul's Altar', the actual description of a murder committed by a naked woman (especially the phrase 'her head broke like an egg on the wall')," as one of the objectionable items for which puritannical standards had delayed publication of "The Burning Baby" volume. Eventually most of the selections proposed for that book were included in The Map of Love. o0 p. 261. The power of this understatement increased when Thomas removed "with a sudden movement" (p. 13a).</page><page sequence="8">40 DONALD TRITSCHLER baby, the policeman looking for her, and their soothing of the baby by riding a merry-go-round may suggest a flight into Egypt, but little is done with the parallel. "The Enemies" (Feb. 11. '34), on the other hand, takes the reader to the strange heart of Thomas' mysterious Welsh valley. The setting for Mr. and Mrs. Owen's cottage in the center of the Jarvis hills gives them a kind of proprietary interest-they came from their village to this isolated valley and fenced out the domestic cattle that grazed in it. Their valley has its special, hyperbolic identity: as Mr. Owen weeds, the descriptions of his garden and the surrounding hills suggest wars and oracles that are more human than vegetable. The grasses have heads and mouths (p. 90), and the green grass is flesh (p. 91). Mrs. Annis Pratt finds this valley in the heart of the fabulous Jarvis hills comparable to the immortal island of Welsh folklore, which she in turn relates to the personal mythology of initiation in "The Map of Love" and other stories." In "The Enemies," Reverend Davies is about to undergo an infernal initiation as he loses his way in this "wide world rocking from horizon to horizon" and comes upon a cottage that might have "been carried out of a village by a large bird and placed in the very middle of the tumultuous universe" (p. 92). Such tumult fills the beginning of the story with images of separation -the bird from his mate and the valley by its stream (p. 89)-and it culminates in the dichotomy of flesh and spirit represented by Mr. and Mrs. Owen. Mr. Owen presides over the rise and fall of life in the garden (p. 90). He is a young, bearded Pan, lord of the concrete things of life, "of the worm in the earth, of the copulation in the tree, of the living grease in the soil" (p. 96). He cannot quite take Mrs. Owen's powers seriously, for they are intangible, dark powers from the other world. Her crystal ball gives up its dead like a grave; it is one of the abstractions, such as the sound of the wind and the shadow on the tablecloth, that indirectly reveal the nature of the world to her (p. 95). She resembles Mr. Owen only in that they both have superhuman powers and her strange, green eyes recall the green grass of his garden. This dynamic, pagan world opposes Reverend Davies' pallid, Christian world. Mrs. Owen loves the dark that so frightens Mr. Davies.

She treats the Owens under her discussion of Thomas and the occult (Chapter IV).</page><page sequence="9">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 41 The old man loses his way in his own, dead world and enters their domain, where he senses both their conflicting forces as the hills seem to "storm" the sky and darkness gives him no comfort from the wind (p. 91). His black, clerical hat is replaced by a cloud as he moves out of Mrs. Owen's ball and into the fleshly valley of Mr. Owen, and while the rocks of the valley draw human blood from him, he becomes a shape among the stars in Mrs. Owen's crystal. In contrast to his power- ful enemies, Mr. Davies is a white-haired phantom whose light is absorbed by Mrs. Owen's darkness-the world "had given under his feet" (p. 95). Though the action is relatively static, the tense confrontation of enemies is a lyric poet's tableau of a world suffering the timeless clash of opposites. The clash of flesh and spirit in Mr. and Mrs. Owen, with all its related imagery mentioned briefly above, is complemented in another dimension: the clash of the Owens' pagan concentration on life and Mr. Davies' Christian preparation for death, as represented by dark and light imagery and other details. Mr. Davies reaches toward a blessed state in this clockless, roaring world, but his saintliness am- biguously emerges as a "ragged circle of light round his head" (p. 96). He is finally an insubstantial, ineffective "old god beset by his enemies" in the house of the proud flesh and the evil spirit. Mrs. Owen's evil shows much more explicitly in "The Holy Six," the sequel to "The Enemies." There she merges with Miss Myfanwy, as "Amabel Mary" (p. 203), and is pregnant with the fleshly child of Mr. Owen, though about to give virgin birth to the spiritual child of Mr. Davies. Apparently the child is the seventh and greatest sin, which is surrounded by the six sins that arrived at the Jarvis valley when Love's (Mr. Vole's) cart wrecked; their names are given as anagrams of lust, greed, envy, fear, cruelty and spite. In both stories the vitality of the world is too much for the ghostly Mr. Davies, and in the second one he takes his place among them. A weak god fails in this world, the house of sins. Though "The Holy Six" unites the characters of "The Enemies" in a circle of sin, it is probably a different story from "The Enemies United" because both titles appear in two of the lists in the Red Note- book. (See note 4.) If "The Enemies United" was a third story about these characters, Thomas had written more of his short novel, "A Doom on the Sun," than has been discovered. The phrase for this title first appeared in "Find meat on bones," for which the Lockwood library has a manuscript including corrections, dated July 15 '33 and January</page><page sequence="10">42 DONALD TRITSCHLER 1936. The earliest record of the projected novel was in a letter to Pamela Hansford Johnson on 2 May 1934: "My novel-I've done the first chapter-will be, when and if I finish it, no more than the hotch- potch of a strayed poet, or the linking together of several short story sequences. I shall scrap it in a few days." He had just received a telegram from New Stories accepting "The Enemies" for publication, but the news was a mixed pleasure because they paid nothing for it. He had also transcribed into the Red Notebook two other stories, "The Tree" and "The Visitors," which are explicitly set in the Jarvis hills. Nine days later he wrote to Miss Johnson, "My novel of the Jarvis valley is slower than ever. I have already scrapped two chapters of it. It is as ambitious as the Divine Comedy, with a chorus of deadly sins, anagrammatized as old gentlemen, with the incarnated figures of Love &amp; Death, an Ulyssean page of thought from the minds of two anagram- matical spinsters, Miss P. &amp; Miss R. Sion-Rees, an Immaculate Con- ception, a baldheaded girl, a celestial tramp, a mock Christ, &amp; the Holy Ghost." The two chapters would seem to be "The Tree" and "The Visitors [April '34]," for the old gentlemen appear in "The Holy Six." Two days later Thomas was still struggling: "My novel, tentatively, very tentatively, titled 'A Doom on the Sun' is progressing, three chapters of it already completed ["The Enemies," "The Holy Six" and, perhaps, "The Enemies United"?]. So far, it is rather terrible, a kind of warped fable in which lust, greed, cruelty, spite etc., appear all the time as old gentlemen in the background of the story. I wrote a little bit of it early this morning-a charming incident in which Mr. Stripe, Mr. Edger, Mr. Stull, Mr. Thade and Mr. Strich watch a dog dying of poison. I'm a nice little soul, and my book is going to be as nice as me." Apparently the novel was approaching the "lived happily ever after" stage when he scrapped it.12 The few revisions of "The Enemies" give it a story-teller's polish, but the infrequent revisions of "The Dress" (March, '34), the next story in the Red Notebook, are often to its key passages. The madman's pursuers sound like hounds baying after him, and he flees their bestial, adult world to recover an innocent relationship. The Red Notebook stressed a relationship with the mother: "As the moon rose, milkily it put a coat around his shoulders .. ." (p. 22b), and after the wish for shelter and food, "The mist was a mother, but he needed more than a mother's care. . . . He thought of the young woman bening [sic] over 12 Selected Letters, pp. 118, 126 and 130-31.</page><page sequence="11">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 43 the pot. He thought of her hair." The relationship the madman desires with the world is larger than a mother's comfort, and the ending shows it is also more general than lust. The innocence of the madman's wish is not certain at first, and this uncertainty is artfully controlled to develop the reader's anticipation. Though several references to blood on the madman were deleted from the published version, the kinship he feels with the deadly owl is ominous. At the same time, he pities the hare killed by the weasel. Next his isolation is stressed in the encounter with the old man, who flees when the madman says it no night for the son of woman. His violence with the butcher's knife is mentioned, but he has flung it into a tree (a "male" object), discarded it with his anger over his wife, who smiled at other men. The farm wife he comes upon knows he has cut off his wife's lips. In the Red Notebook he felt guilt, for he cut his own throat after he did it (p. 24b), but the omission of this detail in the final version leaves the frightful possibility that he may do violence without any apparent motivation or qualms. The affinity of the madman for the young wife emerges when he thinks of sleep as a girl who will give him her dress to lie on with her; the earth itself is the place of love, for the twigs rustle like her dress as he flees. Shortly after this fantasy, the first glimpse of the farm wife shows her trying on the new flowered dress she has sewn (p. 249). The descriptions of her and her dress, which has a low- cut bodice and which she leaves unbuttoned at the neck, heighten her sexuality. In the Red Notebook this was emphasized by her holding the dress up and saying, "Naughty frock" (p. 24a), but the omission of this comment makes her more innocent in the final version. Instead of the guns the madman expects as he enters the farm house, he sees a fearful girl, but then he is dazzled by the flowers of her dress. The Red Notebook was unnecessarily explicit in this lovely ending: "With the moving of her arm, her dress, like a summer field, danced in the light" (italics mine). The need for sleep was also over- stressed, and the Notebook stated "tired head," instead of the more significant "bewildered head." This story, which could be the banal account of a flight to innocence or simply the madman's search for sleep, becomes a delicate resolution of mad anger in gentle beauty. "The Visitor" (April, '34) is more complex than "The Dress," for its opposing images of life and death interpenetrate. The description of awakening day at the beginning is pervaded by images of death, a</page><page sequence="12">44 DONALD TRITSCHLER condition that reverses at the end. The movement of time displaces life: the heart of Peter the poet is replaced by a clock and his hands move as mechanically as those of a clock. All the places and events of his life converge in this dry day, and he imagines his only release from this dwindled life could be in the ghost of the boy he was when he walked the Jarvis hills (p. 109). Later he makes from words an olive tree, a symbol of long life, that grows under the lake, somewhat as he wishes to lurk beneath the water, but it is only "a tree of words." Then Peter thinks of Christ, whose body was taken from a tree and prepared for burial and resurrection, somewhat as his being is cared for by Rhianon.13 Peter's companions help him reach his destination. He watches Rhianon tidying the room around him and thinks the dead are surprised by the bloom under the skin of the living. He supposes this while she sweeps dust from the picture of Mary, the "lying likeness" (cf. "Our Eunuch Dreams") of his dead wife (p. 110), but the facts that his hands feel like stones on the sea of shrouds covering him and that he has had a vision of his own corpse in a coffin show that he, in his near-dead state, is the one surprised by life. His travelling companion, Callaghan, brings an enemy into his room that threatens to destroy his world. But while death can destroy the webs of life, the poet still retains the walls of memory around Mary (p. 111). The death Peter anticipates is exotic-he is an "island of rich and miraculous plants" (p. 112). He thinks of submersion in the watery sounds of Rhianon's dress. When he says, "Water," he has Rhianon hold a glass of water before his eyes, for he wishes to become "a green place under [the water], staring around a dizzy cavern" (p. 113). Though his self is more passive than the wild self in "How shall my animal," a poem about creativity, the image shows him descending to the deepest level of his being. When Callaghan carries him into the valley, the frost is falling. He sees apocalyptic horrors before all life on the earth dissipates and fresh life springs up (p. 117). This dwindling and renewing of life in the valley anticipates the structure of the spiritual journey in "A Winter's Tale." Peter cries out in joy at this renewal of 13 The name of the girl troubled Thomas. To Peter the poet it "meant nothing. It was a cool sound" (p. 113). In the fair copy of the Red Notebook it was to be "Millicent," but in two places he copied "Heather" and then changed it in pencil to "Hesther," apparently to support her characterization as like "a maiden out of the Old Testament." These were then corrected in ink to "Millicent," the name used in the version published by Criterion, XV (January 1935), 251-9, and not entirely removed from Skin Trade (p. 111). The final name, "Rhia- non," Mrs. Pratt relates to the muse of poetry and learning by that name in Y Barddas, ed. William Ab Ithel (London, 1862)- Dylan Thomas' Early Prose, p. 93.</page><page sequence="13">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 45 life before it again recedes and he and Callaghan must race away, as all spirits must, before the cocks crow. As the story of a writer for whom words are as tangible as things, it shows the loss of poetic powers.14 At the beginning, Peter tastes the blood of Rhianon's and Callaghan's battling words, but toward the end the words he makes are no longer flesh -they seem empty of life. In another sense, the story is about the microcosm within the macrocosm it implies. Peter's room itself is a world within a world, and within even that lies his inner microcosm (p. 110). Peter perceives this world when he hears the blinded birds singing songs of the world within their eyes. (p. 115; cf. "Because the pleasure-bird whistles.") Though Peter in death is losing his senses as a poet-he can't hear Rhianon's singing any longer (p. 112)-and though he is surprised when she finds him dead, he has experienced a blissful world he created on his journey over the naked hills within him, which are represented by the Jarvis hills. The double movements of "The Visitor"- into and out of both life and death, and out of the world and into the universe of the self-are conveyed symmetrically. The predicament at the beginning, in which Peter is haunted by thoughts of his death, reverses at the end, in which he is filled with life and surprised by the sheet being drawn over his face. Again, an image of day at the beginning-"A man with a brush had drawn a rib of colour under the sun and painted many circles around the circle of the sun. Death was a man with a scythe, but that summer day no living stalk was to be cut down" (p. 110)-is balanced by one of night at the end-"A man with a brush had drawn a red rib down the east. The ghost of a circle around the circle of the moon spun through a cloud.... The cock cried again, and a bird whistled like a scythe through wheat" (pp. 118-119). By juxtaposing such organic and cosmic images as have been used elsewhere in the story, these passages emphasize the concentricity of the microcosm and the macrocosm. There are almost no significant revisions of the Red Notebook version for that in Skin Trade, but the Criterion deleted three passages, perhaps 14Thomas also used "Peter" as the name of the poet in the Criterion version of "The Orchards," and it became "Marlais" for publication in The Map of Love. Thomas might have drawn "Peter" from his part in H. F. Rubinstein's "Peter and Paul," that Miss Ethel Ross says he acted with the Swansea Little Theater in Mumbles during March, 1933-"Dylan Thomas and the Amateur Theater," The Swan, II (March 1958), 15-21. In the play Peter lost his poetic powers as he grew older and became involved in his happy family life. Such is the plight of the fisher-hero in "Ballad of the Long-legged Bait."</page><page sequence="14">46 DONALD TRITSCHLER because an editor thought them too explicit, that were almost entirely restored when the story was collected by Thomas.15 Of those stories in the Red Notebook touching on derangement, "The Vest" (July 20. '34.) is most concerned with probing the sickness itself. The association of experiences that are logically unconnected, such as the boy in "The Tree" imposes and the madman in "The Dress" bliss- fully achieves, and amoral violence, such as Martha uses to escape her servitude, both occur in "The Vest," but this story also investigates the immediate causes of sickness. The sight of a dog crushed by a car has bewildered the protagonist. The violence arouses pity in him, but also a glee upon touching the brain and blood, the inner being, of the animal. His mind then flickers between this violence and the violence he has done to his wife when he felt pain himself (p. 253). The con- fusion of the accident causes a fear in him that is represented by dark- ness, particularly by the large shadow in his house (p. 252). This shadow is a projection of the terrible self that he must release, and he does it blindly, insensitively, when he tears his wife's underclothes off. As he walks out of the house, he notices the shadow is broken into many pieces, in keeping with his character, which is represented by the many faces he sees in the mirror, each of which has "a section of his features" (p. 255). He fears the mortality of the flesh, Women, particularly his wife, have betrayed him with their "blind, corrupted flesh" (p. 34a). When he learned of his mother-in-law's cancer, he felt it was his own face that was eaten by locusts. To avoid such corruption of the flesh, he imagined he lay by his wife's skeleton, but in the morning her flesh bloomed proudly with his love; he also made her skin blush when he beat her. The fantastic orgy of violence he imagines in the bar full of women confirms his perverted horror of the flesh. He seeks rational control of experience, as is suggested in the manuscript by his counting 15 The passages deleted were: He was dead. Now he knew he was dead. (p. 116) He heard Callaghan's laughter like a rattle of thunder that the wind took up and doubled. [p. 118] Dead Peter, cried Callaghan, "I showed you death in the valley. And, Lord, you laughed (p. 32a-punctuation and corrections by Thomas.) There was the old rumour of Callaghan down his brain. From dawn to dark he had talked of death, had seen a moth caught in the candle, had heard the laughter that could not have been his ring in his ears (p. 199).</page><page sequence="15">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 47 of steps and streetlamps and his measured ringing of the bell at the be- ginning of the story. The published version deletes some of these opening details, which were presented in a more personal point of view than Thomas finally adopted. The final version is more consistent with the protagonist's cold formality: instead of "he smacked her face" (p. 34a), Thomas makes it "he struck her cheek." In the manuscript her name was Helen; in the final version, which is presented from his impersonal point of view, no name is mentioned. When he remembers her putting on her frock that morning, she is coldly described as an object, "thin in her nakedness, as a bag of skin and henna drifting out of the light" (p. 253). She has brought light into his life, and normally she would disperse the shadow in the house, she would comfort him, but any comforts he felt, such as heat from the dying fire, were removed from the manuscript. The manuscript is more explicit about his feelings: thoughts of "poor dog" and his judgments of his own cruelty were removed, as were the graphic images of the slaughtered dog.16 His reaction to the dog's accident there was "in the first darkness" (p. 34a). The manu- script also interpreted more explicitly the source of violence as his horror of human corruption. When the protagonist noticed the darken- ing room and tasted his sickness, he thought of man's fallen state, "all the pain of life, the pain of the damned, the pain of man . . ." (p. 34b). In addition to removing many explicit statements, Thomas deleted unnecessary details. The removal of the names of bars, which began with the Duke of Wellington, went through the Rose, the Mason, the Men of Devon, and the Rising Sun, and ended significantly at the Waterloo, increases the anonymity of his lonely surroundings, as does the deletion of crowds seen near his destination. Large sections of the final orgy were transferred to that grotesquely humorous account of the fall of man as poet, "Prologue to an Adventure" (Summer, 1937). The man selling an almanac (a record of the temporal world), the girls dancing in sawdust (glass, in the Red Notebook) in that story's bar, the Seven Sins, and the Negress selling a pound of flesh (p. 212) are close to the passages in the Red Notebook (pp. 36b-37b). 16 In the manuscript Thomas explicated the protagonist's sympathetic reaction to his mother-in-law's cancer: "He felt the locust of the cancer on his own face, in the mouth and the fluttering eyelid. He had knocked Helen over the mouth." (p. 34b-deletion by Thomas).</page><page sequence="16">48 DONALD TRITSCHLER The only unpublished story in the Red Notebook, "Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar" (August 8. '34), is another story of nightmarish violence, but on the grander scale of an island setting, such as England, in a class- conscious world. Since air raids and street fighting were dreadful possibilities in the economic struggles of the Thirties, "Gaspar, Mel- chior, Balthasar" is a reductio ad absurdum of the very real spiritual carnage in a sick society. The class war is a leveler of inequities-all die in the same gutters, all are hungry (p. 38b). The conditions of this world seem the reverse of what they are sup- posed to be. The people starve "ihT he-heest-e*-ft ety" (p. 38b-dele- tion by Thomas) because they lack love, the staff of life. The galvanic wheat, which death drove back into the bone, is bullets, "crow's food [that] sliced about them," and their sustenance, such as God gave to the chosen people, is the bombs they desire, "cupping their hands for the exploding manna. Two lovers, struck by the same shell, fell into bliss" in death, not in their love. The power elite, who slip gas masks onto faces that are used to wearing masks daily, who must even pur- chase sleep in this commercialized society, are surprised from their sybaritic preoccupations and their seedy occupations.17 In their society life is denied (babies are starved), and money, leisure, and love are stolen. (These details were deleted.) In return, the workers to whom they give guns turn them greedily against their former "slave masters," and "the keys of hate [are found in the blood of] the opened pulses" (p. 39a-all deleted by Thomas.). The new life born out of this strife is the ability to hate. The story then shifts to the first person when two ghosts appear to search for something among the dead. All usual activity, such as commerce, travel, communication and ceremony, has halted in this barren world: "The ships were unloaded at the wharves, the engines cold in the stations, the printing presses silent, and the sentries before the island palace stiff, spl4t-4ike-ea-bage&amp;, in their boxes" (p. 39a- deletion by Thomas). The speaker feels out of place in this land that has only the appearance of life; he is "a ghost -t--ia-spfinghir -we, -a 17The Red Notebook reads, "... as they climbed out of a purchased sleep, puffed out of tenement offices, cupping their hands..." (p. 38b-deletion by Thomas.). It is difficult to ignore some of the many deletions in the manuscript. The description of the sky as a hangar was removed, apparently because it was confusing, and the explanatory "hangar of the shadow of death" may have been struck because it was stated too heavily. The trend of corrections on the first two pages removes much obvious sarcasm, but a guess about the corrections is risky because they are sometimes incomplete. The many inks and pencil used indicate Thomas tinkered with the story several times, even considered sending it to Adelphi, before he rejected it.</page><page sequence="17">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 49 se4id-mff-1--an-ww-r4-that--was--as--a-gh4" (pp. 39a-b- deletion by Thomas.). Furthermore, this new world is only "the last of the first revolution" dying away as he enters "the first stages of the night" (p. 39b). The speaker draws nearer to the ghosts as they hunt the ruins and examine the corpses; he begins to take on the garb of a wise man -"I held my scarf to my face for the smell of the flowering dead" (p. 39b). Though these dead "flower," they are black plants, the ominous signs that "the hemlock &amp; the upas sprouted for me from the gutter beds" (p. 39b). Melodramatically, a minute before midnight, he sees a kind of "star of Bethlehem" at the end of the street. It is a lantern that first "was a red rose among the flowers that stank at my side"; this ironically Dantean image was changed to "It was bright &amp; sweet among the flowers . . ." (p. 40a). The ghosts pass him and he follows them toward the lantern, "calling them by name," but revolutionists, "dark-eyed behind their lantern," stop him to ask, "Who are you, comrade?" When he says to let him pass because he is "of the wise men," they want to know where he is going. He knocks the lantern from their hands and runs past, pursued through a maze of alleys by shots from their revolvers. When he reaches the ghosts in a moonlit square, "at their feet lay a dead woman, naked but for her shawl, with a bayonet wound in her breasts" (p. 40a). While he watches, "a miraculous life stirred in her belly, and the arms of the child in her womb broke, lifted, through the flesh" (p. 40b). The two ghosts bow down and offer gold and frankin- cense, and as the speaker kneels, his pursuers shoot him. Originally the ghosts were named Gaspar and Melchior and the speaker learned from them that his name was Balthasar when his ghost rose from him. But the names were deleted, "bitter as myrrh" was changed to "my blood streamed bitterly," and instead of anointing the mother's feet, his blood anoints "the emerging head." Such changes make the story less obvious but more maudlin. This quality and the over-intellectual- ized symbolism may have been among Thomas' reasons for abandon- ing the story, but still it is significant as one of many attempts to consider the Christian myth within a world such as ours, that reverses Christian values. Hate is born into this dark world. Though this bitter allegorical sketch of class warfare was clumsy, Thomas used some of the same imagery years later, in his brilliant elegies for man in World War II. The bitterness is still there, but it becomes more powerful when</page><page sequence="18">50 DONALD TRITSCHLER barely controlled by such understatement as is used in "A Refusal to Mourn." The child born in "The Burning Baby" (September. '34) is imagined by Rhys Rhys to be a Second Coming, but it is a child of the flesh, Vicar Rhy's supposed enemy. Like many Thomas characters in the Red Note- book and elsewhere, Rhys struggles with the flesh because of its mortal weaknesses, but he does not realize he has made it his god, somewhat as man has made God in his own fleshly image. Thomas treats this inverted relationship between God and man literally by suggesting sexuality is the "Word" of an anthropomorphic god when he has Rhys Rhys put the stem of his pipe in a "mouth" between his flybuttons (p. 130). He then casts down the Bible and reads in another book "of the old woman who had deceived the devil. [Since he thinks] the devil is poor flesh" (p. 131), he hopes to deceive it by producing a god from it, and he thereby deceives himself. The woman who bore his daughter saw "the woman witch in his male eyes" and loved him passionately, but she died in child- birth. Then she stole the child of his second love and left a changeling in its place (p. 131), but this child is a shadow "cast by the grave sun," a pun that expresses an idea akin to what Thomas summarized in "Twenty-four years" as the meat-eating sun." When the story opens, only the changeling survives to wander over the fields like a personi- fication of death, "with the motion of a man cutting wheat" (p. 128). Rhys Rhys has been obsessed with this cutting of ripeness. He said in his sermons that the world was "ripe for the second coming of the son of man" (p. 129), but the ripeness was of the flesh, his daughter's flesh. On the morning that the gorse burst into flames, almost as miraculously as when God spoke from the burning bush, and Rhys desired his daugh- ter, the Red Notebook had him thinking, "She was the failure of the flesh, &amp; the skinny field. Poor flesh, he said, and touched her arm. She trembled at the heat in his fingers. Only the poor are beautiful. The poor soil shudders under the sun, he said" (p. 41 b). The purpose of the incest, Rhys seems to rationalize, is to achieve the second coming and re- deem the poor flesh that is burned daily by the "grave sun." But the changeling, that resulted from a death, haunts Rhys with his symbols of death, the skins and skulls that he covets. On the day of the incestuous conception, Rhys takes a rabbit carcass from him and keeps it in his pocket while he seduces his daughter. The section ends with the changeling's words, "I want the little skull," and though it recalls the carcass, it may also refer to the child of the union. During her preg-</page><page sequence="19">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 51 nancy the changeling watches his sister in her daily dying and imagines her skull nailed above his bed. In both cases Rhys attempts to trick death of its due: by burying the dust of his daughter near him, in a "virginal" white coffin, and by burning the body of the baby. The Red Notebook emphasized the paganized import of the ritual by stating, "He stacked the torn heathers in the midst of the druid Bard's Circle where the stones still howled on the witches' sabbaths" (p. 46b). Though Rhys Rhys has enacted a ritual of man's triumph over death, the self-deception is clear when the flesh of the baby screams from the flames. The final story is more obviously autobiographical than any other in the Red Notebook, and it is also one of the more complicated ones. Originally called "Mr Tritas on the Roofs" (October.'34), it became "Anagram," a phantasy about the artist and thereby an anagram of what he does. The name Tritas is itself an anagram, but in the Criterion version he was renamed Peter-the name Thomas used for the poet in "The Visitor"-and for the Map of Love collection he became the more obviously autobiographical Marlais.18 Another change was the setting of the story, which in the short "Anagram" version (five pages) was London, and in the expanded "Orchards" version was Swansea, Wales, and the world beyond. Thomas may have written "Anagram" in Lon- don, where as a free-lance artist he began concentrating on fiction because of its greater commercial value; by publication time he had discovered how deep were his Welsh roots and turned to the notion of the artist as folk-hero adventuring through the land of his being. The additions to the beginning and end of the story (pp. 137-40 and 143-9) were the dream of the burning orchards and the artist's terrible journey through the dying world. Despite these changes, the story remains an anagram of the artist's struggle to unify his "three-cornered life" (pp. 49ab), the worlds of life, death and his own vision. The burning apple orchards in his dream are his anagram of this life. The two scarecrows, "two fruit-trees out of a coal-hill" (p. 140), the sister trees in the vegetable garden, are the tree of knowledge, that is associated with light, and the tree of life (and death), that stands in a circular shadow with crows on her shoulders (p. 137). Marlais tries to write of his vision in which, "under the eyelids, where the inward 18 Criterion, XV (July 1936), 614-22. The Skin Trade version did not excise "Peter" entirely.

The artist looks inward at archetypal experience, from which comes "Marlais's death in life in the circular going down of the day" (p. 140; cf. "Author's Prologue."). When he steps onto the roofs (in a setting sometimes resembling Cwmdonkin Drive), he observes "below him, in a world of words, men on their errands moved to no purpose but the escape of time" (p. 141). As an artist standing halfway between the stars and the toy of the town below the roofs, on the one hand, and building images that touch both death and life,19 on the other, he must involve himself by attempting to achieve a unity of awareness. The unity is possible when, as a folk-hero or, in another part of this dream of man's fallen state, as an apple farmer, he adventures through eleven valleys. The first valley implies a unity of heaven and earth in its hills that are "unbroken walls, taller than the beanstalks that married a story on the roof of the world" (p. 146). Beyond these eleven valleys he realizes his own artistic vision when the orchards of time burst into flame at the edge of the sea. The three levels of the artist's awareness are represented, for example, in the three images of the moon: the shadow of the "mock moon" in the north, the real round moon shining on the earth, and "the half-moon of his thumb-nail rising and setting behind the leaden spire" (pp. 140-41). The struggle for unity of this awareness is stated directly in the final version-"lt is all one, . . ." (p. 142)-and it was the revelation in the concluding lines of the manuscript: ... he moved for the last answer (p. 142). And all was image and was image, but Mr Tritas on the roofs sought a cohesing image of the dead and the quick. So he came at last to a skylight by a chimney side, and leant over the leaded rim. There, in the attic, sitting upright in a dark coffin, a joyful gentleman smiled at the crowds of heaven and played on a violin. Death &amp; life was one image &amp; one anagram. Odd thief in the folds, cried Mr Tritas on the roofs. October.

The last two lines and the change from "some" to "a," as well as the date, are in later pencil.</page><page sequence="21">DYLAN THOMAS' RED NOTEBOOK 53 Thomas removed this ending and added a much more elaborate anagram for "The Orchards." The artist's predicament is that he makes life-he has "five-fingered life" before him (p. 142), but he also kills with words, which are lifeless abstractions. They are words, not flesh, and life intrudes on the death he would put into his story of a woman wailing beside Russian seas in a cold wind from Antarctica (p. 139). What Thomas would later call "the meat-eating sun" defeats his struggles with words (p. 140). The artist's imagination can make people and angels of the chimneys on the roofs, but somewhat like Lot's wife, they turn to stone as he at- tempts to fix their reality with words (p. 138). Though the artist may scramble over the lives in the rooms below, while he watches the images of life and death in the stars (p. 48b), "the word is too much with us." This half humorous parody of Wordsworth keynotes a story that summarizes the predicament of the artist, who lives with insub- stantial words, on the rooftops of the world. The anagram that concludes the story shows the artist, "our virgin Marlais," as his rooftop creations call him, entering life, experiencing first-hand the vision of the burning orchards that he dreamed before. Until now he has been a coward, hesitant to embrace the "unholy" women of Llanasia, romantically willing to settle for his dream of "a life too beautiful to break" (p. 143), but he steps from the rooftops into the falling world. He sees the barren coal-tables that embrace Llanasia like a grave. All life is dominated by the sun that has shown since man fell from innocence, as Marlais is now falling. When he begins his role as a folk-hero, he passes through myths that summarize man's nature: the revolt in Heaven, the Fall from Paradise, the Homeric vision of the "wine-coloured sea," the notion of a single source of the sea, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, even Jack and the beanstalk. When he journeys to the last hour on the last hill down to the sea, he actually witnesses his dream image of burning life and finds the fair girl who possesses the being he has committed to life. At the end of the artist's life, which is all lives, Thomas says the story is more terrible than all those stories of the fictional Jarvis hills. The artist finally loves the world, but he is left with dead objects, in the embrace of a scare- crow, somewhat as the fisherman succumbs in "The furious ox-killing house of love" ("Ballad of the Long-legged Bait," 1. 200). Art and life must both be insufficient at last to survive the dry twig of death. Thomas' obsession with death is as prominent in the Red Notebook as in most of his poetry: processes of time dominate the worlds of</page><page sequence="22">54 DONALD TRITSCHLER "Martha," "The Visitor," "The Vest," "The Burning Baby" and "The Orchards." Because the artist attempts to stop time in art21 he must struggle against life's inevitable self-consummation, and he therefore feels the effects of process acutely. Peter in "The Visitor" and Marlais in "The Orchards" both attempt to preserve their worlds in the artifice of words, but they, like (or as) the dead, are continually surprised by the encroachments of actual life; whether it gives the lie to the abstrac- tions of their medium or it pushes them relentlessly toward death, the process is the odd thief in the fold. (Cf. The Thief of "In Country Sleep.") Others, such as the protagonist of "The Vest," attempt to escape time and decay in violence or, obversely, flee violence in an attempt to recover past innocence, as does the madman of "The Dress." Death is often shown in the other stories as one of the results of man's fallen state. Thomas rarely depicts innocence, as represented by the idiot in "The Tree"; rather, those such as the boy in that story or Martha in "A True Story" commit outrageous acts in their amorality. In other words, they share in the fallen state of man by acting as na've agents of evil when the free-flowing evil in the world fortuitously infests them. Others commit evil acts more pointedly. More knowing than the boy in "The Tree," the vicar Rhys in "The Burning Baby" has perverted Christian values with the narrow nonconformism so traditional in Wales. Another foolish cleric is the Reverend Davies, who wanders into the Jarvis valley, the heart of life forces that the Owens control. Their pagan power is too much for the weak Christian values of Davies. An early theme of Thomas, this weakness is repre- sented in the poetry as the Christian God's indifference-especially in "Incarnate Devil"-or man's perversion of Christian values. He treats the distortion lightly in "Shall gods be said to thump the clouds," seriously in "The spire cranes," and bitterly in the manuscript of "After the funeral,"22 where the insincere mourners stand in contrast to the natural goodness of dead Ann. The treatment in fiction of themes that Thomas used in his poetry is not surprising, nor are the occasional verbal echoes in his works. He quite naturally used motifs in one work that he planned for another. 21 See my "The Metamorphic Stop of Time in 'A Winter's Tale,'" PMLA, LXXVIII (September 1963), 422-30. 22 Held by the Lockwood Library and dated "Feb 10.

Her blood was fluttering as he moved. The lashes of her fingers lifted. He saw the ball under the nail."23 Another passage of the "Orchards" manuscript may have been used for phrases and images of "A grief ago": The sky is a strange land at night, fltINI/d where the.seasons 6di0f pass over in a drift of star &amp; snow, and the dark, scythe-sided grasses in the lunar country drop at the dawn. Wqrkjfl (p. 48b) The Red Notebook reveals much about Thomas' working habits and about his understanding of the artist's work. Though his first idea for a novel about the Jarvis hills and valley, "A Doom on the Sun," was soon abandoned, it is not surprising that several of his stories, as well as his poems, use the Carmarthenshire setting around Fern Hill, the farm where he spent so much of his youth. "The Dress," "The Burning Baby" and "Prospect of the Sea" invoke a comparable setting. "The Enemies," "The Tree," "The Visitor" and "The Holy Six" name the Jarvis setting, and "The Map of Love" shows two children the love that remains of Jarvis himself and his baldheaded wife. His ambitious story "The Orchards" started from a sketch using an urban setting, but it was expanded to show the artist as folk-hero going out to a place even more dreadful than the magical Jarvis hills to encounter reality. Either of these strange places possesses life in its fullest sense and pro- vides a counterpart to the conventionality of Llareggub, which is mentioned in some of these stories. 23 P. 45b) The second sentence, which was not consistent with the changeling's point of view, was removed from the published version.</page><page sequence="24">56 The heroism of the artist in "The Orchards" is his stepping out of a romanticized artistic world, one such as Thomas suspected in "After the Funeral," into the tumult of life among the women of the street to seek the deepest resources of life and death in the last valley. The struggle to enter reality is a sustained theme in Thomas' works about the artist's creativity. The name of the artist in the Criterion version of "The Orchards" and in "The Visitor" evokes slang associations con- sistent with his advice to Charles Fisher (February, 1935): "Poetry... should be as orgiastic and organic as copulation, dividing and unifying ... Men should be two tooled, and a poet's middle leg is his pencil. If his phallic pencil turns into an electric drill, breaking up the tar and the concrete of language worn thin by the tricycles tyres of nature poets and the heavy six wheels of the academic sirs, so much the better."24 Thomas almost identifies creation and procreation, and as the letter implies, violence, or at least violent wrenching of symbols, such as many of the dream-like Red Notebook stories use, is necessary to reach "the first beasts' island" in his map of Love. 24 Selected Letters, p. 151. This association of the phallus with the poet's pen is very likely a reason for his early selection of the name "Peter" for his fictional poets. See also note 14.</page></plain_text>
