<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Striped Goddess from Gilat: Implications for the Chalcolithic Cult* Nili Sacher Fox University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia In 1975, during the first season of excavations at Gilat, a Chalcolithic site in the north western Negev, two elaborately decorated sculptured containers were unearthed: an anthropomorphic vessel in the form of a woman and a zoomorphic vessel shaped like a ram (Figs. 1, 2). There has been much scholarly discussion concerning their identity and function, specifically in a cultic context. The aim of this study is to focus on the painted decorations of the figures, primarily those of the woman, to explore the possibility that some of the markings signify body paint and to investigate the cultic implications of this possibility in surviving contemporary material. As is well known, our understanding of Chalcolithic practices in the Negev region is limited to interpretations of surviving material remains and comparable material from contiguous contemporary cultures. In order to expand the scanty evidence, the search for potential similar scenes will be extended to ethnographic evidence from societies temporally and spacially removed. Although identifying the practice of body painting from decorated artifacts and recreating its functional significance is conjectural, I believe that the archaeological evidence, combined with general anthropological observations, provide sufficient information to reconstruct a tentative picture. THE VESSELS AND THEIR CONTEXT The ceramic vessels shaped as a woman and a ram were uncovered in the centre of a room in the remains of a building complex at Gilat.1 These figures are part of a cache from the same stratum that contained numerous cult-related Chalcolithic * This article would not have come to fruition without Dr. E.D.

The ram is hollow and barrel shaped, and carries on its back three containers, which fit into openings in its body to form a single receptacle (1.: 27.5 cm.; h.: 23 cm., including containers). The animal's mouth, nostrils and horns are modelled, but the eyes are indicated by painted circles with a central dot. The ram's body is decorated with a row of hanging red triangles, a group of three long horizontal stripes and red paint on its underside and legs. The woman's body, like the ram's, is a hollow barrel-shaped vessel (h.: 31 cm.). A container, shaped like a churn or a water skin, rests on her head and forms one tall receptacle with the body. The figure sits on a biconical stool and balances the 2 D. Alon and T.E.

The gender of this nude female is depicted by small knob-like breasts and visible incised genitals. Alon notes that this figure's painted decoration is one of its most outstanding features.3 The details pertinent to the discussion are the following: the stool and churn are entirely red slipped; the miniature chalice is painted with horizontal and vertical lines; the woman's torso, arms and legs are covered with red horizontal stripes painted in groups of twos and threes; her eyes are painted circles with a dot to denote the pupil; her hair is represented by sidelocks painted in front of the ears and eight thick wavy lines painted down to the middle of her back; two long vertical lines extend from her eyes down to her waist; her protruding beak-shaped nose is accentuated with red paint, but, like in other Chalcolithic figures, there is no indication of a mouth. Several scholars have addressed issues concerning the identity of these two vessels, the building in which they were discovered and the organization of the society in which they functioned.4 Levy proposed that chiefdoms characterize the social organization during this period and that priests may have occupied the top-ranking position.5 Based on the architectural plan of the building and the nature and find-spots of the artifacts, it is generally agreed that a sanctuary existed at Gilat. The anthropomorphic vessel (Fig. 1) is thought to represent a deity associated with a fertility cult. Her divine nature is inferred from the artistic rendition of the figure, her posture, the stool she sits upon, the vessels she carries and the fact that she is fashioned as a container.6 The biconical stool is thought to have functioned either as a pedestal, like the Nafral Mishmar 'crowns',7 or as a birthing stool.8 The latter interpretation, which assumes that the woman is pregnant, would explain her sitting position and the emphasis on her genitalia. The receptacle on the woman's head has inspired debate regarding its identity and cultic association. Alon and Levy classify the vessel ? as well as comparable Chalcolithic vessels ? as a butter churn symbolizing fertility, associated with a 3 Alon (above, . 1), pp. 117-118. 4 Ibid.; R.

The ram-shaped vessel would thus also be viewed as a symbol of fertility and milk production, two vital components of a herding economy.9 An alternative explanation, favoured by Amiran, is that the container depicts a goat-skin used to carry water, and that the cult in question is thus a water cult. This is supported by the similarly-shaped vessels carried by a bull figure from the temple at -gedi, which, overlooking two streams, has been identified with a water cult.10 It has also been argued that the need for sufficient water or rain for agriculturalists and pastoralists in this dry region probably surpassed the desire for an abundant milk supply.11 The painted decorations on the ram, which, it has been suggested, represent an ornate leather blanket used to cover the animal on cultic or festive occasions,12 are the only ones to have been considered in detail. Alon has suggested that the stripes on the woman could signify tattooing or merely be decorative,13 but these possibilities and their ramifications have not been pursued. In order to ascertain whether the stripes on the goddess from Gilat could represent body painting, and the implications for the Chalcolithic cult(s) of Palestine, we will first examine the pervasiveness and context of this and related practices in antiquity in general. MARKINGS OF CULTURE Tattooing and Scarification Body marking in the form of paint, tattoo or scarification is a phenomenon found among cultures worldwide since prehistoric times. Ethnographic studies indicate that tattoos or marks of scarification, which entail permanent bodily alterations, symbolize membership in a particular group or may be part of a socialization process associated with life-cycle stages.14 Evidence of tattooing and scarification in the ancient Near East can be traced to the Neolithic period. Three female 'fertility' figurines from 'Ain Ghazal bear marks on their bust, abdomen, buttocks and thighs.15 Similar marks are depicted in several Tassili rock paintings from the Sahara, contemporaneous with the 'Ain Ghazal figurines. One such illustration, called the 'Horned Goddess' or 'White Lady 9 Alon and Levy (above, n. 2), p. 193. 10 D.

The earliest potential example is a female figurine from the fourth millennium B.C.E. marked with geometric patterns on her shoulders, thighs and legs.18 A number of mummies from the Middle Kingdom are tattooed, and a few were buried with figurines bearing identical tattoo designs.19 Several tattoos are preserved on the mummy of a woman named Amunet, who served as a priestess to the goddess Hathor at Thebes, c. 2000 B.C.E.20 Written records from later periods reveal that body marking was employed to designate a status of servitude. Neo-Babylonian texts report that slaves were branded or tattooed, often with their master's name.21 In Israelite society, a slave who wished to remain with his master was marked by ear piercing (Exod. 21:5-6). One may speculate that permanent body marking signified a special role or social status, albeit not necessarily an inferior one, in earlier periods as well. Body Painting and Masking In contrast to tattooing and scarification, body painting and masking involve temporary techniques for altering the body's appearance. Both body painting and masking are prevalent worldwide among societies of varying social complexities, from Paleolithic to modern times. Body painting alone functions in rituals to blur the body's image, replacing it, aesthetically, with something more liminal, but not encompassing secrecy.22 Masking adds the dimension of disguise or transformation, enabling individuals to assume an otherwise impossible role: men can become women, the elderly can be young, humans can be transformed into animals, mortals can become gods.23 Disguise is often incorporated into rituals whose purpose is to placate or regulate deities or spirits. Masking enables the impersonator to identify himself with the very power that he is impersonating, thereby enhancing his own potency.24 Written attestation of the practice from antiquity is inconclusive. A Sumerian poem describes a cultic ceremony performed before the goddess Innana, possibly 16 H. Lhote: The Search for the Tassili Frescoes, London, 1959, pp. 80-81, Fig. 35. 17 A.

Sometimes designs are drawn with the paste, and the figures are often crowned with a horned headdress. Although these texts indicate some type of body painting and perhaps disguise, the purpose of these designs is unclear. Evidence from wall paintings and sculptured forms is more revealing for our purposes. Cave paintings as early as the Paleolithic depict hunters masquerading as animals.27 Thousands of Neolithic and Chalcolithic figurines ? both intact and fragmented ? that appear to be masked are reported from sites in Europe, most notably of the Vinca civilization.28 Several Neolithic and Chalcolithic rock paintings from the Sahara reveal various scenes of masked humans. The body of one masked figure is covered with red paint criss-crossed by white lines; in another scene hunters are masked and painted like animals.29 Lhote observes that a few of the masks resemble those still used in 20th-century African initiation rites.30 Two sites in Anatolia have yielded impressive finds. In the remains of the Neolithic village of ?atal H?y?k several rooms are elaborately decorated with wall paintings, plaster reliefs of animals and deities, horned animal heads and cult statues.31 Adjacent scenes of goddesses in a state of parturition and of vultures preying on corpses suggest that the focus in these chambers was on birth and death. One room, dubbed the 'vulture shrine', is covered with paintings of vultures attacking headless humans. In one such scene the vultures' feet appear to be human. The picture may depict priests or other members of society disguised as vultures, performing a funerary rite.32 Chalcolithic sites in Anatolia (c. 5200-4800 B.C.E.) have yielded elaborately 25 T. Jacobsen: The Harps that Once..., Sumerian Poetry in Translation, New Haven, 1987, p. 116. The precise nature of the ceremony is uncertain, due to two possible readings of the Sumerian term gu-Du-g?n-na. The term gu-Du means 'buttocks' (Akkadian qinnatu) and g?n-na means 'multi-coloured'. The two terms in conjunction, however, signify 'multi coloured cords or threads'. See C.

All three figures are female shaped and are covered in red paint stripes. One of the females from Ha?ilar has small knob-like breasts like the Gilat figure. The eyes are designated with paint, or, in one Ha?ilar female, incised to be inlaid. The ears and noses are modelled, but, noticeably, like the Gilat figurine, not one possesses a mouth. In contrast to the Gilat figure, they are covered entirely with geometric patterns, consisting mainly of long zigzagging lines. Although these painted designs could represent clothing, the markings on their 33 J. Mellaart: Excavations at Ha?ilar I, Edinburgh, 1970, pp. 130-142.</page><page sequence="9">220 NILI SACHER FOX faces can be interpreted as painted disguise. Both are portrayed with ballooning lower torsoes, which, like the barrel shape of the Gilat goddess, may represent a state of pregnancy or may merely be indicative of the shape of the vessels. Some of the attributes of the figures described above are present on a number of Mesopotamian statuettes from the Halaf period (fifth to fourth millennium B.C.E.). These figures are characterized by prominent eyes and detailed decorations. Noses are sometimes indicated, but mouths are rarely present. Painted stripes on the breasts, legs, arms and torsoes are the most common decoration.34 It is unclear whether the markings represent ornaments, tattoos, body paint, or a combination thereof.35 One cannot help but notice the recurrence of the red colour in wall paintings, decorated figures and painted non-sculptural pottery from this period. Anthropologists have observed that in nearly every society red is multi-vocal, possessing both auspicious and inauspicious connotations that symbolize life forces and those forces associated with danger or death.36 These antithetical symbolic aspects of red may already have been conceived in antiquity: red predominates in most of the wall paintings at ?atal H?y?k; several panels are entirely painted in red; a headless female figure from this site, perhaps a fertility goddess, is covered with red floral patterns similar to the designs painted on the walls; several bull's heads have red bands around their horns.37 As noted above, the paint on the anthropomorphic vessels from Ha?ilar and Gilat and on the Gilat ram is red, as are the geometric designs on the pottery from Ha?ilar and the rim bands on bowls, jars and cornets from Chalcolithic Palestine.38 A most intriguing use of red paint is in the form of cruciform marks on clusters of floor pebbles from Abu Matar.39 Red paint was applied to corpses and human models as well. At 'Ain Ghazal, the face of one plaster statue is marked with three vertical red stripes in the brow area and three diagonal red lines on the cheeks.40 At ?atal H?y?k, a disarticulated body of an adult male bears stripes of red ochre on the skull and around the neck.41 Red was probably chosen because of its symbolic association to blood and its 34 G.

This funerary practice perhaps represents the first stage of the body-marking process.42 THE GODDESS FROM GILAT WITHIN THE LOCAL CULT As shown above, there is evidence from assorted sources that body marking, including painting and masking, was practiced in the ancient Near East. In addition, we have noted specific shared characteristics of artifacts from different sites, such as similarities between the anthropomorphic vessels from Ha?ilar and Gilat, the predominance of 'mute statues', without mouths, and the recurrence of the colour red. However, despite data supporting interaction between certain regions, especially Anatolia and Palestine,43 we cannot at present assess the impact, if any, of these conceivable connections on the cult(s) of Palestine. The goddess from Gilat, therefore, must be evaluated primarily within the framework of her immediate world, the region of southern Palestine. Masking and painting in ritual contexts in Palestine can be traced to the Neolithic period. A life-size clay head from Jericho features shell eyes and painted brown stripes extending from the forehead down to the chin. A stone mask was found at Horvat Duma, and stone masks, together with various cult-related objects, were found at Nahal IJemar, among them a life-size mask decorated with red and white lines around the eyes and green marks on the forehead.44 Modelled skulls covered with asphalt cords in net-like patterns and parts of painted clay heads were also uncovered there.45 These embellished masks and heads may represent an attempt to immortalize the individual after death, or may have functioned in the ritual process.46 Attestation of masking in the Chalcolithic period has been preserved in wall paintings from Teleilat Ghassul. Five of the seven paintings illustrate masks or 42 Hambly (above, . 19), pp. 309-310. 43 Some scholars believe that the arsenic copper used to produce the objects from Naljal Mishmar, as well as objects from sites in Palestine, such as the 'mirror' from Kabri, originated in Anatolia. See Tadmor (above, n. 4, Treasures), pp. 85-86; A. Leonard and B. Williams (eds.): The Judean Desert Treasure from Na/?al Mishmar, A Chalcolithic Traders Hoard, in Essays in Ancient Civilizations Presented to Helene J. Kantor, Chicago, 1989, p. 251. Obsidian artifacts from the sanctuary at Gilat were probably also imported from Anatolia, see Alon and Levy (above, n. 2), p. 208. 44 O. Bar-Yosef and D.

Although later, these support the theory that masks are commonly associated with cult rituals. See J. Carter: The Masks of Ortheia, AJA 91 (1987), p. 370.</page><page sequence="11">222 NILI SACHER FOX masked figures, some in a ceremonial context (e.g. Fig. 4). Cameron labels the masks 'spook or death masks', and suggests that they were modelled on the symbol of the vulture for use in funerary rites.47 Like at ?atal H?y?k, the motifs and symbols of the Ghassulian paintings reflect a concern for life, death and rebirth, the vulture being a facilitator of the rebirth process.48 Although the Ghassulian masks cannot be positively identified as depictions of vultures (see above), other material remains suggest that these birds of prey played a role in the cult of this region. The frequency of ossuaries found indicates that Chalcolithic burial practices included entombing the bones of the deceased in decorated ceramic containers after the body was excarnated, presumably by predatory birds.49 Thus, vultures could have become a symbol associated with death. ?. s Fig. 4. Wall painting from Teleilat Ghassul showing masked figures. 47 Cameron posits that the mysterious horn-like shapes on the heads of the masked Ghassulians in procession were originally vulture feathers, but were mistaken for horns in a later reconstruction. See D.O. Cameron: The Ghassulian Wall Paintings, London, 1981, p. 13. 48 Ibid., pp. 16-20. In ancient Egypt the vulture was sacred to most mother goddesses (i.e. Hathor, Nekhebet, Isis) and was considered a purifier. Vultures symbolized fertility, death and immortality.

Porath: Taiyiba, Burial Cave, Excavations and Surveys in Israel 1989/1990 9 (1990), pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="12">STRIPED GODDESS FROM GILAT 223 Furthermore, one of the copper standards from Narval Mishmar in the shape of a bird has been identified with a griffon vulture,50 and may have been carried in ceremonial fashion akin to the procession pictured at Ghassul.51 In addition to displaying cultic masquerade, the paintings from Teleilat Ghassul reveal affinities to the Gilat goddess. The frequency of horizontal and vertical lines in the wall paintings is conspicuous, with stripes, at times wavy, prevalent in all the scenes and apparently bearing some significance. Horizontal bands on several Ghassulian masks are analogous to those on the goddess's forehead. In one painting entire figures are covered in stripes from head to toe.52 Some of these stripes, especially those covering the feet, may, in fact, be body painting. In sum, body painting, in conjunction with masking, may have played a part in costuming officiants of cultic ceremonies. Certain animals conceivably played a part in the ceremonies, perhaps with adornments. The goddess from Gilat, cloaked with bands of red paint, and the decorated ram may mirror that custom. The role of the goddess within the cult may be further elucidated by images on ossuaries, such as the anthropomorphic subjects on the frontons of two ossuaries, one from Ben Shemen (Fig. 5a) and the other from Azor (Fig. 5b). Like the goddess from Gilat, they are decorated with red stripes. Most notable are resemblances between the heads on the ossuaries and that of the goddess, particularly in the striped headdress.53 These images probably belonged to the same artistic tradition, and the same goddess may be the subject of the ossuaries' decor and the Gilat vessel. We have noted the possible interconnection of life, death and rebirth symbols in the cults of ?atal H?y?k and Teleilat Ghassul.54 It is possible that the fertility goddess from Gilat was believed to function in the rebirth process as well. Considering the centrality of the agricultural cycle and the propagation of flocks in the lives of farmers and pastoralists, a religious concept of birth, death and rebirth as cyclical, providing for the revival of the dead, is viable and would explain the images of the goddess on ossuaries. The choice of red for the coloured decorations on the goddess from Gilat may also be revealing in this context. Its death-related allusions are not as clear as its symbolism of life and rebirth, prevalent in the ancient Near East, although 50 Tadmor (above, . 4, Treasures), pp. 80-81. 51 Standards similar to those from Nahal Mishmar, including an eagle standard, are pictured on the stele of Gudea. This and other parallels from Mesopotamia are discussed by P. Beck: Notes on the Style and Iconography of the Chalcolithic Hoard from Nahal Mishmar, in Leonard and Williams (above, n. 43), p. 41. 52 Cameron (above, n. 47), Figs. 1, 37. 53 Tadmor has suggested that the headdress on the Gilat vessel depicts cloth padding for carrying the churn (above, n. 4, Israel Museum Journal), p. 7. Two small churns were found at Azor, although not attached to the ossuary, see Perrot and Ladiray (above, n. *), p. 68. 54 For similar conclusions, see Gimbutas (above, n. 28), pp. 195-196.</page><page sequence="13">224 NILI SACHER FOX Fig. 5. Anthropomorphic subjects on frontons of two ossuaries: a) from Ben Shemen; b) from Azor. the existential connection between the loss of blood and life would have been apparent to the ancients. The life-in-death or death-in-life symbolism of the colour red may be reflected in the stripes on the goddess from Gilat and on other objects. Red may communicate her dual aspects or may represent her perpetual life-endowing powers. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that there are signs of a long tradition of body marking, including body painting, in the ancient Near East. A few isolated texts from later periods, coupled with ethnographic observations, buttress the material evidence drawn from wall paintings, decorated sculpted figures, pottery and human remains. The notion that sculpted figures were decorated by painting to imitate the markings on humans is supported by Egyptian tomb finds and cult statues of present-day African tribes. Identifying the form of body marking, however, is more difficult. The flat stripes of red paint on the Gilat goddess do not resemble the relief character of marks of scarification, but tattooing cannot be entirely ruled out. Her stripes, however, do not conform to typical tattoo designs, which, like those on the Egyptian</page><page sequence="14">STRIPED GODDESS FROM GILAT 225 mummies, bear more definite forms and are localized on the body. Based on these observations and on previous discussions of the costumed figures in the wall paintings from Teleilat Ghassul, we suggest that the goddess's decorations represent body painting. Another aim of this inquiry was to reconstruct some aspects of the Chalcolithic cult of the Negev, albeit tentative, incorporating the material evidence and implications of body painting and masking. We have noted similarities between motifs and style of artifacts from Palestine and non-contiguous sites. It is, however, unclear whether cultic utilization of certain symbols, such as the vulture and fertility figures decorated in red, would have necessitated cultural borrowing or could have been the natural outcome of practices and beliefs shared by different societies. Our reconstruction of the Negev cult is therefore based primarily on interpretations of local cult-related objects and pictorial representations. The wall paintings from Teleilat Ghassul contribute greatly to an understanding of the Negev cult.55 Although the precise nature of the paintings remains elusive, the illustrations preserve symbols and rites that were probably components of the cult. The procession scene, in particular, fits well into Levy's conception of the social structure of Chalcolithic Palestine, in which priests presided, or at least played a prominent role. The goddess from Gilat and her companion, the ram, are outstanding as special cult items within a repertoire of cult-related objects. As discussed, these two sculpted containers appear to be associated with fertility cults, but whether a milk or water cult is unclear. One would expect a fertility goddess affiliated with a milk cult to be portrayed with full breasts, yet the small knob-like breasts on the woman from Gilat seem to be of secondary concern, certainly less highlighted than her genitals. Nevertheless, the vessel on her head probably represents a churn, especially since a number of these containers contain strainers in their necks.56 Her sitting position and swollen abdomen may indeed manifest pregnancy and childbirth. We propose that the goddess and the ram were part of a fertility cult centred around milk and/or water, in which birth, death and rebirth were perceived as cyclical, ensuring the revival of the dead. The prevalence of red on these and other objects reinforces this theory. We can tentatively recreate a colourful picture of individuals costumed to enhance their efficacy, officiating at ceremonies to celebrate the agricultural cycle, the fertility of the herd and human life-cycle events. 55 J.
