<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Pardes: A Talmudic Enigma from a Persian Perspective* Maria E. Subtelny The Talmudic tale of the four sages who entered the pardes has long been considered a classic text of early Jewish esoterica, and despite the many scholarly treatments it has been subjected to, it remains a crux interpretum in the study not only of rabbinic literature, but also of early Jewish mysticism. To do justice to the various interpretations proffered by scholars over the years would require, at the very least, a separate bibliographical study. These range from Gershom Scholem's placement of the tale within the framework of early Gnostic literature {Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition) and David Halperin's analysis of it in the context of rabbinic literature {The Faces of the Chariot), to Peter Schäfer's comparison of it with the story of Paul's heavenly ascent ("New Testament and Hekhalot Literature: The Journey into Heaven in Paul and in Merkavah Mysticism") and Howard Eilberg-Schwartz's daring Freudian analysis {God's Phallus)} Even se- * I would like to acknowledge the kind assistance and invaluable suggestions pro- vided by my colleagues, Jim Diamond, Vincent DeCaen, Walid Saleh, Barry Walfish, Isaac Hollander, Michael Marmura, Tirzah Meacham, Harry Fox, and Douglas Frayne. I am particularly indebted to Elliot Wolfson for his critical comments on several drafts of the article. 1 Gershom Scholem, "The Four who Entered Paradise and Paul's Ascension to Paradise," in his Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition, 2nd rev. ed.

Morray- Jones' analysis of the so-called water illusion, which occurs in an expanded version of the tale (A Transparent Illusion)? The tale has also fueled the imaginations of numerous modern Jewish poets, writers, and storytellers, most notably the great Hebrew poet, Hayyim Nahman Bialik, whose hauntingly beautiful poem, "Peeked and Died," was di- rectly inspired by it.3 The scholarly study of the tale has itself taken on something of a legendary quality, as discussions about the precise nature of the "spiri- tual adventure" to which it alludes show no signs of abating.4 My inten- tion here is to contribute to the broadening of the scope of the inquiry by introducing a new perspective on the analysis and interpretation of the tale. This perspective is a Persian one, which although historically justified in the study of ancient Jewish religio-literary culture, has for the most part been overlooked in favor of internal rabbinic evidence, or Hellenistic and other influences.5 While examining the tale for the first Blum et al.

See most recently the provocative study by James R. Russell, "Ezekiel and Iran," Irano-Judaica 5 (2003): 1-15, in which he draws a parallel between Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones and the Zoroastrian conception of apocalypse and resurrection. 6 See my Le monde est un jardin: Aspects de l'histoire culturelle de l'Iran médiéval (Paris: Association pour l'Avancement des Études Iraniennes, 2002), chapt. 5; and lectures delivered at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington ("Paridaiza and Pardes: The Gar- den in Perso-Islamic and Jewish Mysticism"), Cornell University ("The Four Sages who Entered the Pardes: A Persian Perspective"), and Harvard University ("Metapho- rical Dimensions of the Garden in Medieval Persian and Jewish Mysticism") during 2002-2003. 7 Tosefta, Hagigah, 2: 3-4; P Talmud, Hagigah (Synopse zum Talmud Yerushalmi, 2/ 5-12, ed.

It is, however, used consistently in the various Talmudic versions of the tale, as well as in its elaborations in the Hekhalot literature. For its significance for the interpretation of the tale, see p. 36 below.</page><page sequence="4">6 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 Ben eAzzai peered and died.9 With regard to him Scripture says: "Pre- cious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Ps. 116:15). Ben Zoma peered and lost his mind. With regard to him Scripture says: "If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you be surfeited with it and vomit" (Prov. 25:16). Elishae ben Abuyah (also known as Aher) peered and cut down the sap- lings. With regard to him Scripture says: "Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin" (Eccl. 5:5). Rabbi eAqiva entered and exited (in other versions: ascended and des- cended) in peace.10 Regarding him Scripture says: "Take me away with you, let us make haste!" (Songs l:4).n Like other parabolic accounts in rabbinic literature, the tale must be situated in its literary context, as it is context that opens the way for interpretation.12 In all of the abovementioned sources, the tale is cited as an illustrative commentary on the restrictions imposed on the exposi- tion of certain topics in the Torah that were regarded as esoteric doc- trines, in particular, "the account of the Chariot-throne" (maaseh mer- kavah)P The rabbis stated that this topic, which referred primarily to the anthropomorphic depiction of the divine Glory enthroned, as scrip- turally attested in the first chapter of Ezekiel, could be interpreted by an individual only if he was a sage (hakham) "capable of comprehending on his own."14 The other doctrines on which exegetical activity was re- 9 In some Talmudic variants of the tale, the names of the first two sages, Ben e Azzai and Ben Zoma, are reversed, but this has no bearing either on the flow of the narrative or on the interpretation proffered here. See Halperin, Merkabah, 86 and 92; Rowland, Open Heaven. 320-21; Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 306 n. 48. 10 For a discussion of this alternative expression, see p. 31 below. 1 1 The gist of the tale, as presented here, is closest to the versions in the Tosefta and P Talmud. I do not plan in this study to undertake a literary-critical analysis of the differences between the various versions with a view to determining which represents the earliest or original version. Given the intractability of the problems connected with its dating, this would be a futile exercise, as has been amply demonstrated by the heroic attempts of others. My interest is only in the interpretation of the tale qua metaphor. 12 On the relationship of the tale to its literary context, see Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, "Elisha ben Abuya: Torah and the Sinful Sage," The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosonhv 1 (1998Ì: 206-207. althoueh. somewhat surorisinelv. he does not elaborate. 13 On this point see C.

The restriction is introduced by the phrase, 'eyn doreshin, the verb dar ash referring to exegetical exposition. 14 B Talmud, Hagigah, lib. This was also interpreted to mean that it could not be expounded to another person by a teacher, but this does not appear to conform to the sense, as it would hardly be necessary to expound to someone who was already a hakham. For the rabbinic attitude toward ma'aseh merkavah, see Halperin, Merkabah, esp. 19ff; Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 3ff; also Morray-Jones, "Paradise Revisited"</page><page sequence="5">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 1 stricted were the prohibited sexual relations Çarayot) outlined in Leviti- cus 18 and 20, which were not to be expounded in the presence of more than three people, and "the account of creation" (maeaseh bere'shii) at the beginning of Genesis, which was not to be expounded in the pre- sence of more than two people.15 That the account of the Chariot-throne was considered the most eso- teric of the three doctrines would appear to be supported not only by the small size of the group in which it could be expounded (either by one person, or to one person), but also by the blanket recommendation im- mediately following the restriction on its exposition, which states that people should not engage in speculation about four things: "what is above, what is below, what is in front, and what is behind."16 Anyone who does so is said to exhibit a lack of "respect for the Glory (kavod) of his Creator," and would be better off never having been born - a warning that should be kept in mind for our later discussion of the interpretation of the tale.17 Most scholars are therefore in agreement that the tale is a cautionary one, illustrating the dangerous consequences of unrestricted or unsupervised exegetical study of the scriptural passages dealing with the Chariot-throne vision.18 But what exactly does the doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah refer to? The rendering of this expression as the "account of the Chariot-throne," (Part I), 186-88. The rabbinic restrictions notwithstanding, there were many medieval commentaries on the merkavah vision - see Hanna Liss, '"It is not Permitted to Ponder the Deeper Meaning of the Verse': An Interpretation of the Merkava- Vision in Ezekiel According to the Commentaries of Rabbi Shelomoh Jitzchaqi (Rashi) and Rabbi Eli'e- zer of Beaugency," Jewish Studies Quarterly 7 (2000): 42-64. 15 Again, this was also interpreted to mean exposition to three and two people, respectively. At any rate, these two instances referred to exposition to a larger, public audience. Restrictions on the exposition of esoteric doctrines were well-known both in the Jewish Kabbalistic tradition and in Islamic Sufism. The great ninth-century Muslim mystagogue, Junayd, restricted the number of people to whom he would expound Sufi doctrines to twenty - see Ali Hassan Abdel-Kader, The Life, Personality and Writings of al-Junayd: A Study of a Third/Ninth Century Mystic (London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1962), 35. 16 On this point see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 4; Joseph Dan, The Ancient Jewish Mysticism (Tel- Aviv: MOD Books, 1993), 26; see also Scholem, Jewish Gnosti- cism, 38. 17 For an interpretation of this passage, see p. 43 below. 18 These dangers were underscored by the Talmudic accounts that describe how even those who grasped the meaning of the Chariot-throne vision during exegetical study became surrounded by flames and even consumed by fire - see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 4. A parallel phenomenon is attested in the medieval Islamic tradition in stories told about individuals who died as a result of having grasped the true meaning of the Qur'an while reciting it or hearing it recited - see Walid A. Saleh, The Formation of the Classical Tafsïr Tradition: The Qur'an Commentary of al-ThaclabT ( D. 427/1035) (Leiden-Boston: Brill, 2004), 59-60.</page><page sequence="6">8 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 which alludes primarily to the scriptural account of Ezekiel's visions, does not provide any indication of the actual content of the esoteric teaching it comprised.19 It appears to have been concerned with a con- ception of the divinity, but precisely what aspect of divine ontology did it refer to? It is outside the scope of this study to provide an excursus on the doctrine of maaseh merkavah, which would take into account the impressive body of scholarly literature to which it has given rise.20 The discussions of the doctrine nevertheless remain highly conjectural and largely inconclusive, centering on its esoteric nature, the dangers it posed, and the secrecy that surrounded it, rather than offering a succinct explanation of the theological point it embodied.21 Given that the tale of the four sages was intended to illustrate the rabbinic restrictions on ex- egesis of ma'aseh merkavah, some definition of the doctrine would ap- pear to be in order before embarking upon an interpretation of the tale. 19 The expression has also been rendered as "work of the Chariot(-throne)," "action of the Chariot-throne)," and even "structure of the Chariot-throne," none of which provides an idea of its meaning - see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 4 n. 5; for the term ma'aseh, see below. According to Scholem, the term merkavah, which does not appear in Ezekiel as a designation for the divine Throne (the customary term for which is kisse9), is derived from 1 Chron. 28:18 (although the reference is not particularly con- vincing), and the earliest attestation of its use in this sense is in the apocryphal Wisdom of Ben Sira (Ecclus. 49:8) - see Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (New York: Meridian/ Penguin, 1978), 373. Perhaps the usage was inspired by the image, frequently attested in Scripture, of God's royal or war chariots (merkavot) (e. g., Is. 66:15; Hab. 3:8), which undoubtedly reflected the ideological importance of the chariot in Assyrian and Achae- menid royal ceremonial and iconography - see Pierre Briant, Histoire de l'Empire perse: De Cyrus à Alexandre (Paris: Fayard, 1996), 236. This image would appear to be supported by ancient Midrashic interpretations in which God is depicted as manifest- ing Himself upon His chariot at the time of the Exodus from Egypt - see Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, ed. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, trans. Allan Arkush (Prin- ceton: The Jewish Publication Society and Princeton University Press, 1987), 20-21. 20 The bibliography on the topic of ma'aseh merkavah is even larger than that on the tale of the four sages, and it extends into studies on medieval Kabbalistic literature, in which it figures prominently. The standard works on the topic in rabbinic literature are Halperin, Merkabah, and Halperin, Faces of the Chariot (for full references, see n. 1 above). 21 By way of illustration, see the section entitled "Ma'aseh merkavah defined," in Halperin's Merkabah, 157-62, and his proposal of "a model of the 'real' ma'aseh mer- kabah" which he suggests may even have been a fiction! - see Halperin, Merkabah, 182-83; or Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 30 (where he states that, "the secret doctrine remained so elusive ... that I suspect it never existed."); see also Morray- Jones who defines it simply as "an esoteric, visionary-mystical tradition associated with Ezekiel 1" - Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part II), 265 and (Part I), 182, n. 14. In his entry on "Merkabah Mysticism or Ma'aseh Merkavah" in the Encyclopaedia Judaica (11: 1386), Scholem defined it very broadly as "the complex of speculations, homilies, and visions connected with the Throne of Glory and the chariot (merkavah) which bears it and all that is embodied in this divine world" - see Scholem, Kabbalah, 373.</page><page sequence="7">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 9 I will therefore limit myself to formulating a working definition for the sole purpose of elucidating the meaning of the tale, being mindful of the fact that such a definition cannot possibly do justice to the complexity of the concept or reflect the nuances of theological thinking about it that found expression in the vast corpus of rabbinic writings. It would appear that ma'aseh merkavah referred to what was arguably the single most profound and profoundly troubling theological issue in early Judaism: the seeming contradiction between the notion of the un- likeness of God and the ineffability of His Essence on the one hand, and the depiction of God in Scripture in unmistakably anthropomorphic terms on the other.22 This is the central paradox of divine Presence and Absence that informs the book of Ezekiel, in which the God who cannot be seen is envisioned anthropomorphically as a king seated on a throne, surrounded by His angelic court, and commanding His heavenly armies.23 In this mythopoeic idiom, the motif of the divine Throne, more particularly, the divine Glory (kavod) enthroned, occupies centre stage so to speak, and hence may be construed as alluding metonymically to God Himself in His manifested, theophanic forms.24 The rabbinic ex- 22 See Harry Austryn Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Juda- ism, Christianity, and Islam, 2 vols.

Kutsko, Between Heaven and Earth: Divine Presence and Absence in the Book of Ezekiel (Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 23 and 150-53 (although his approach is more historicizing). On the Biblical image of God as King, see Marc Zvi Brettler, God is King: Understanding an Israelite Metaphor (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1989). For the image in Midrash, see David Stern, Parables in Midrash: Narrative and Exegesis in Rabbinic Literature (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991), 19ff. The paradox is captured in one of the Hekhalot narra- tives {Hekhalot Zutrati) connected with the tale of the four sages, which juxtaposes the well-known scriptural verse, "For no man may see Me and live" (Ex. 33:20), with the verses, "For God speaks to man, and he lives" (Deut. 5:21), and "I saw the Lord seated on a throne" (Is. 6:11) - see Peter Schäfer, ed., Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 4 vols. (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1987-95), 3: 20-21; for the tale in Hekhalot literature, see p. 26 below. 24 Besides the first chapter of Ezekiel, verses in Isaiah and Daniel are notable in this respect: "The heavens are My Throne (kis'i) and the earth is My Footstool (hadom raglai)" (Is. 66:1); "I saw the Lord seated on a throne (kisse9), high and exalted, and the skirt of His robe filled the whole temple" (Is. 6:1); and "As I looked on, thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took His seat" (Dan. 7:9). In the speculative trend within Mu'tazilite philosophy in Islam (eighth-ninth centuries), the motif of the divine</page><page sequence="8">10 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 pression maeaseh merkavah may thus be defined as referring to the theo- logumenon which pertains to the nature of the ontological relationship between God's invisible Essence and His self-manifestation in forms perceptible by man.25 In a nutshell, it is concerned with the concept of divine theophany, and the way in which it was to be understood within the framework of Jewish monotheism.26 Throne Çarsh) was interpreted as denoting the whole of Creation as an emanation of the Godhead - see Gösta Vitestam, "eArsh and Kursi: An Essay on the Throne Tradi- tions in Islam," in Living Waters: Scandinavian Orientalistic Studies Presented to Pro- fessor Dr. Frede Lekkegaard, ed. Egon Keck, S vend Sondergaard, and Ellen Wulff (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1990), 372. 25 Although generally referring to any concept pertaining to God or a system of religious belief, the term theologumenon is more specifically a theological point which does not necessarily represent a dogmatic teaching, but which is nevertheless "the out- come and expression of an endeavour to understand the faith by establishing connec- tions between binding doctrines of faith" - for this definition see Richard N. Soulen and R. Kendall Soulen, Handbook of Biblical Criticism, 3rd rev. ed. (Louisville-London: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001), 196. Since it has also been understood as "histor- icizing" something that was originally a theological statement, theologumenon would appear to be an apt rendering of the term ma'aseh, which refers to a narrative genre in rabbinic literature that has a similar function. For the term ma'aseh, see p. 23 below. It follows, then, that the companion expression, ma'aseh bere'shit, referred to the theolo- gumenon pertaining to divine cosmogony. Hence, taken together, the three abovemen- tioned esoteric doctrines may be understood as referring to the three central theological issues raised by Jewish Scripture, which are presented in the Talmudic narrative in ascending order of importance: sexual-genetic relations; the origins of man and his world; and divine ontology. 26 While the medieval Islamic theosophical tradition elaborated a technical termi- nology for the concept of divine theophany (tajallï ilãhl, zuhür ilahï, mazhar ilahï, etc.), the rabbinic tradition appears to have been more reticent, preferring to refer to it by means of the expression, ma'aseh merkavah (although the Hebrew term, hithgalut, which corresponds to the Arabic tajallï, was used later in the medieval period). Scho- lars in Jewish studies seldom use the word theophany, which appears to be reserved for the recognized Biblical instances of God's self-revelation, employing instead the Chris- tian theological term, hypostasis (also, hypostatic form, hypostatic manifestation, etc.). In my opinion, not only does the term hypostasis not convey quite the same idea, but its use creates an artificial distinction between the theophanies in the Bible and God's manifested forms outside the scriptural record. By not making such a distinction, the entire Jewish angelology, beginning with the Angel of the Lord, including the Shekhi- nah, and ending with the Sefirotic emanations of the medieval Kabbalists, may be interpreted as divine theophanic forms - thus Henry Corbin, Le paradoxe du mono- théisme (Paris: l'Herne, 1981), 8. To this list may be added the divine Attributes (mid- dot), and the divine Name or Tetragrammaton itself- for which see Elliot R. Wolfson, Through a Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), 107-108; also Daniel Abrams, "The Boundaries of Divine Ontology: The Inclusion and Exclusion of Metatron in the God- head," Harvard Theological Review 87.3 (1994): 292.

The dangers inherent in the transmission of the doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah, which could easily be misconstrued or misinterpreted by the uninitiated, and used for polemical purposes by non- Jews, were repeat- edly stressed in the literature.30 For this reason, it was usually shrouded in a veil of secrecy and referred to as a deep religious mys- 27 See B Talmud, Hagigah, 2a. 28 On the problem of the relationship between the Ezekiel reading and the festival, see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 17fF., 262 ff., and 449; also Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part I), 182-83. 29 It is interesting to note that the word used in Hagigah to denote personal "ap- pearance" at the Temple is the verb yir'eh, which may also be read in the passive as yera'eh, that is, in the double sense of "seeing" and "being seen," thus suggesting a full "visionarv" narticination in the celebration of the maior Jewish festivals. 30 See, for example, the responses suggested by Saadia Gaon (d. 942) to attacks, presumably by non- Jews, relating to the problem of Biblical anthropomorphisms - cited in Schäfer, Mirror of His Beauty, 105-106; or the reply provided by Ibn Kammü- na of Baghdad (ca. 1280) to the objection raised by non- Jews to Biblical passages indicative of anthropomorphism and anthropopathy, which figure very high on his list of standard criticisms of the Jewish faith - see Moshe Perlmann, trans., Ibn Kam- müna's Examination of the Three Faiths: A Thirteenth-Century Essay in the Compara- tive Study of Religion (Berkeley-Los Angeles-London: University of California Press, 1971), 54-57. Thus also the unambiguous warning expressed by an anonymous thir- teenth-century Hebrew author against discussion of anthropomorphisms with non- Jews, specifically with respect to the Shekhinah: "But if you think in your thoughts ... that the Shekhinah has a body, [then I say that] we are not permitted to think of this and also not to mention it to a non- Jew." - see Abrams, "Boundaries of Divine Ontology," 320-21. For criticism of the blatantly anthropomorphic literature known as "The measurement of the divine Body" (Shi'ur qomah, on which see p. 48 below), see Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm (Leiden-New York-Cologne: E.

Subtelny JSQ 11 tery (raz).31 It may be surmised that whenever the term raz is used in similar contexts, it is to be understood as an allusion to the theologu- menon denoted by this rabbinic expression.32 The following warning contained in the Lesser Hekhalot (Hekhalot Zutrati), which was ad- dressed to those who had comprehended the meaning of the Char- iot-throne vision, sums up in a dramatic way the attitude toward the esoteric doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah and its disclosure: If you wish to be singled out in the world, so that you will discover the mystery {raz) of the world and the hidden secrets of wisdom (variant read- ing: the Merkavah), learn this teaching (mishnah) and be careful with it until the day of your death: Do not strive to understand what is behind you (i. e., the future), and do not examine the sayings of your lips. What is in your heart - strive to understand it and keep silent [about it], so that you will be worthy of the vision (tsefiyyah) (variant reading: the beauty) of the Merka- vah?2' Be careful with the Glory (kavod) of your Creator, and do not descend to it,34 and if you have descended to it, do not enjoy it, because you will end up being banished from the world. "[With regard to] the Glory (kavod) of God: conceal the matter" (Prov. 25:2, with adaptation), so that you will not be banished from the world.35 31 The Hebrew/ Aramaic word, raz, which represents a borrowing from Middle Per- sian (Pahlavi), denoted the deepest mysteries of religion in Zoroastrian as well as in Manichaean religious texts - see Shaul Shaked, "Esoteric Trends in Zoroastrianism," in his From Zoroastrian Iran to Islam: Studies in Religious History and Intercultural Con- tacts (Aldershot, UK: Variorum, 1995; originally published in Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 3 [1969]: 175-221), I: 206-13; also p. 44 below. It is noteworthy that the term is used in one Middle Persian religious text with specific reference to the Jewish tradition - see Shaked, "Esoteric Trends in Zoroastrianism," 212. 32 This would appear to be corroborated by the reference to the anthropomorphiz- ing literature of the Shïur qomah as "this mystery" (raz zeh) - see Daniel Abrams, "The Dimensions of the Creator - Contradiction or Paradox? Corruptions and Accretions to the Manuscript Witnesses," Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts 5 (2000): 41; and p. 49 below for the connection between the ShVur qomah portrayal and the doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah. 33 The variant, tsefiyyat ha-merkavah, is found only in one manuscript, but it is clearly to be preferred, not only as the lectio difflcilior, but also because it is the tech- nical term for contemplation of the divine Chariot-throne - see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 149; and n. 137 below. 34 For this technical usage of the verb "to descend" (yarad) in connection with contemplation of the divine Chariot-throne, see p. 32 below. 35 Peter Schäfer, ed., Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1981), §335 (Hekhalot Zutrati); and Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 3: 1-2 (§335); for an English translation, see Annalies Kuyt, The 'Descent' to the Chariot: Towards a Description of the Terminology, Place, Function and Nature of the Yeridah in Hekhalot Literature (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1995), 205.

Anas (d. 796), in response to a question about the meaning of the Qur'anic verse, "Then [God] seated Himself upon the Throne Çarsh)":31 The "how" (i. e., of God's seating Himself upon the Throne) cannot be understood [through intellection] (ghayr ma'qüt), but the fact of "[He] seated Himself" cannot be ignored {ghayr majhüt). Belief in [the divine Throne] is incumbent, but it is heresy (bid'ah) to ask about it.38 The concluding words of this statement, which raise the spectre of here- tical thinking, would appear to corroborate the reasons adumbrated above why speculation about this highly sensitive theological doctrine would have been considered dangerous in both religious traditions.39 36 For the throne tradition in Islam, see Josef van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft im 2. und 3. Jahrhundert Hidschra: Eine Geschichte des religiösen Denkens im frühen Islam, 6 vols. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1990-97), 4: 407-11; see also Vitestam, "eArsh and Kursi," 369 ff. Henry Corbin was, to the best of my knowledge, the first scholar to note the correspondence between the merkavah of the Jewish religio-mystical tradition and the divine Throne Çarsh) in Islam - see Corbin, Le paradoxe, 102. For an elaboration of this correspondence and its historical implications, see my "Le motif du Trône et les rapports entre le mysticisme islamique et le mysticisme juif," in Philosophies et sagesses des religions du Livre : Colloque Corbin (Paris, Sorbonne, 6-8 novembre 2003), éd. Pierre Lory and Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi (Brepols, forthcoming). 37 See Qur'an 7:54, 32:4, and 57:4. These correspond to such Biblical verses as Dan. 7:9, Is. 6:1, etc. In the Islamic tradition, the term kursï is also used for the divine Throne, as in the famous "Throne verse" (Qur'an 2:255): "His Throne encompasses the heavens and the earth." There does not appear to be a difference between the terms earsh and kursï (the latter derived from Aramaic kurseya = Hebrew kisse*) as these are used in the Qur'an, but in the prophetic Traditions and in Islamic mystical literature, a differentiation was made between carsh meaning "throne," and kursï meaning "foot- stool," just as in the Jewish scriptural tradition (for which see n. 24 above) - on this point see Vitestam, "eArsh and Kursi," 374. 38 Vitestam, "eArsh and Kursi," 377 (citing the ninth-century theologian, al-Darimï, Kitãb al-Radd ealã al-Jahmiyya, ed. Gösta Vitestam [Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup and Lei- den: E.J. Brill, 1960], 27). 39 In connection with his own interpretation of the tale of the four sages, Moses Maimonides (d. 1204) stated that the "account of the Chariot" (ma'aseh merkavah) was to be understood as alluding metonymically to the "divine science" (al-eilm al-ilãhi), that is, the Aristotelian concept of metaphysics, and he echoed the rabbinic restrictions by warning that to embark upon its study was "very harmful" {mudirrun jiddan) - see Moses Maimonides, Dalãlat al-hairïn, ed.

In the Kabbalistic interpretation,</page><page sequence="12">14 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 A Persian Perspective on the Pardes The tale of the four sages is based on an implicit metaphor, and its interpretation hinges on an understanding of the term pardes, which functions as the metaphorical vehicle. It stands to reason that, if the meaning of the term pardes is unclear, it will not be possible to grasp its figurative application, particularly since the tenor, that is, the subject to which the metaphorical vehicle is applied, is not specified. Yet, it appears that this is precisely what has occurred, as scholars have inter- preted the tale without first arriving at an understanding of this all-im- portant term and its grounds.40 Gershom Scholem appreciated the "highly suggestive" use of the word pardes in the tale, and he stated that it had two connotations - a general one, meaning "orchard," and a specific one, which referred to a "heavenly paradise."41 However, Scholem's translation of pardes as "orchard," which was not based on any philological inquiry and may even have been informed by modern Hebrew usage, did not do justice to the meaning of this ancient Near Eastern cultural term. Moreover, as subsequently noted by many researchers, the way in which the word is used in the rabbinic sources does not support the meaning of "heavenly paradise" at all.42 Nevertheless, on account of Scholem's great authority in the field of Jewish studies, his renderings became so widely accepted the "divine science" was interpreted as "divine wisdom" (hokhmat ha-'elohut), that is, esoteric gnosis, or theosophy - see Elliot R. Wolfson, Abraham Abulafla - Kabbalist and Prophet: Hermeneutics, Theosophy and Theurgy (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 2000), 176 n. 222. The association of the divine science with the Throne of God is a standard feature of Shftte esoteric commentaries on the Qur'anic verse, "And His Throne was upon the waters" (Qur'an 11:7) - see Henry Corbin, "'Et son Trône était porté sur l'eau ...' (Qorân 11/9)," in In Principio: Interprétations des premiers versets de la Genèse (Paris: Études Augustiniennes and CNRS, 1973), 297. 40 The terms vehicle, tenor, and grounds are used here in a technical sense, as they apply to the use of figurative language - see M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms, 7th ed. (Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1999), 97. 41 Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 16. 42 Thus, for example, Ephraim E. Urbach, "Ha-Masorot eal Torat ha-Sod bi-Tequfat ha-Tannaim" [The Traditions about Esoteric Doctrine in the Tannaitic Period], in The World of the Sages: Collected Studies by Ephraim E.

In all fairness to Scholem, it ought to be noted that he was not the first to gloss pardes as heavenly paradise - see Josef Horovitz, Das koranische Paradies (Jerusalem, 1923), 7 (citing Abraham Geiger, Juda- ism and Islam, trans. F. M. Young [1833; New York: Ktav, 1970], 33-34, with specific reference to the tale of the four sages). For the problem of interpreting the tale in terms of a heavenly ascent, see p. 3 1 below.</page><page sequence="13">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 1 5 that the term pardes continues to be glossed as "orchard" or "garden" and/or "heavenly paradise" even in the most meticulous recent scholar- ship.43 It is, in my opinion, the failure to investigate more deeply the meaning of this highly charged term from the realm of ancient Near Eastern realia that has precluded the possibility of interpreting the fig- urative intent of the tale in a way that ventures beyond cautious hy- pothesizing at best.44 The Hebrew term pardes is a loanword from the Old Persian *pari- daida (literally "enclosure"), via the Median form paridaiza, which de- noted a walled garden precinct, although of a very special type.45 It is attested in what are generally considered late books of the Bible, that is, those dating from the Persian period.46 The term paridaiza appears to 43 See, for example, Kuyt, 'Descent' to the Chariot, 216; Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 47 ff. Several scholars surmised that it must have denoted a king's gar- den, and some even noted that the word pardes was derived from the Persian, but without understanding fully its meaning in the imperial Iranian context - see Jacobs, Jewish Mystical Testimonies, 30; Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 240; and Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 3 1 . 44 Perhaps the most far-fetched explanation is that proffered by Samson Levey, who believed that the term pardes should actually be read as parados, the Hebrew form of the Greek paradosis, which refers to the traditions concerning the life of Jesus and the teachings of the early Christian Church. On this basis, he explained that the sages in the tale were engaged in an investigation of the messianic claims of Jesus. See Samson H. Levey, "Akiba: Sage in Search of the Messiah; a Closer Look," Judaism 41.4 (1992): 334-45; and also his "The Best Kept Secret of the Rabbinic Tradition," Judaism 21 .4 (1972): 454-69 in which he suggested that the "secret" is that Ben Zoma converted to Christianity. 45 See W.

Subtelny JSQ 11 have been specific to the Achaemenid Persian historico-cultural context (sixth-fourth centuries BCE).47 It came into Aramaic, and most likely from there into Hebrew, not from the domain of gardening or agricul- ture, as one might expect, but from the realm of government and admin- istration, which represented the chief source of Persian lexical borrow- ings into imperial Aramaic, the official language of Achaemenid admin- istration.48 In Late Babylonian inscriptions from the time of the Achae- menid ruler, Cyrus (ca. 530 BCE), the term occurs in the form pardesu.49 Supporting the fact that the term pardes denoted a very different type of garden enclosure from the more common Hebrew designations for garden (gari) or vineyard (kereni) is the general linguistic principle gov- erning lexical borrowings, which dictates that a new word is usually not borrowed to replace an existing term, but rather, a borrowed word is adopted for a cultural item not otherwise provided for, usually for rea- sons of prestige.50 What distinguished the pardes from the generic Near Eastern garden, which in the economy of irrigation agriculture was ne- cessarily a walled enclosure, was its connection with the imperial Persian palace institution.51 to the warden of the king's pardes (shomer ha-pardes), who was to supply the Jew, Nehemiah, royal cupbearer to the Achaemenid king, Artaxerxes, with timber for the rebuilding of Jerusalem. 47 See Christopher Tuplin, Achaemenid Studies (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1996), 109 ff. and esp. 121, based on a close reading of Greek sources in particular, in which the term is attested in its Greek form, paradeisos. Supporting the contention that the word was borrowed from the Achaemenid cultural sphere is the fact that it is attested in Middle Persian only in the form palïz, which survives in New Persian (i. e., Persian of the Islamic period) as a déclassé term denoting a melon or vegetable patch. The word pãlTz still occurs with the meaning of garden in some early New Persian works, such as Firdawsï's Shãh-nãmah, but it was eventually supplanted by the term bãgh - see 'All Akbar Dihkhudã, Lughat-nãmah, 14 vols.

Subtelny JSQ 11 The connection between kingship and the garden is an ancient one, dating back to the period of neo-Assyrian rule in the ninth century BCE. The Assyrian kings appear to have been the first to detach the garden from the temple, and they utilized the monumental royal garden as an instrument of imperial propaganda and political legitimation, link- ing it not only with the idea of territorial domination, but also with the cosmic role of the ruler as guarantor of the fertility of the land.57 They took great pains to assemble in their royal gardens all the known species of trees and plants, often importing new species from conquered terri- tories,58 and the pomegranate and date palm featured prominently in their royal iconography.59 So closely connected was the garden with As- syrian notions of imperial sovereignty that the Assyrians conducted a systematic policy of destruction of the royal gardens of their conquered enemies.60 The Achaemenids, for whom the notion of the garden as royal space was a central feature of their imperial ideology, linked the garden even more closely with the palace institution by integrating it architecturally in a single complex surrounded by a walled enclosure.61 Like their As- d'Artaxerxès II sur la rive droite du Chaour," Cahiers de la Délégation archéologique française en Iran 10 (1979): 147-48. 57 On this point see David Stronach, "The Garden as a Political Statement: Some Case Studies from the Near East in the First Millennium B.

The palace of Cyrus (mid-sixth century BCE) at Pasargadae, the first Achaemenid royal capital, was situated in a rectangular garden which was traversed by stone-lined irrigation channels and surrounded by a high wall.65 An open audience hall containing a fixed throne seat faced the garden, with the view down the longitudinal axis of the garden. In keeping with the symmetry which characterized Achaemenid architecture as a whole, this "interior" garden appears to have been arranged on a quadripartite plan.66 This same garden ambience is evoked in the description of the 478. A possible connection between neo-Babylonian royal gardens and Persian con- cepts of garden design before the Achaemenid capture of Babylon in 539 BCE would seem to be proffered by the so-called "hanging gardens" of Nebuchadnezzar II (604- 563), who supposedly built them to please his Median consort - see Stronach, "The Garden as a Political Statement," 174 and 173 (for depictions of gardens in neo-Assyr- ian relief oaintinesì. 62 Briant, Histoire de l'Empire perse, 244-45. See also Tuplin, Achaemenid Studies, 118; and Stähler, "Der Gärtner als Herrscher," 1 1 1-12. As the symbol of a flourishing agricultural economy, which represented the basis of the state's political stability, the garden remained an important feature in Perso-Islamic royal iconography - see Sub- telny, Le monde est un jardin, 103-106. 63 See, for example, Richard T. Hallock, "Selected Fortification Texts," Cahiers de la Délégation archéologique française en Iran 8 (1978): 135 (which mentions the very large number of fruit-tree saplings that were planted in the royal garden). On this important point, see Tuplin, Achaemenid Studies, 104-105; and Briant, Histoire de l'Empire perse, 214 and 457. 64 Briant, Histoire de l'Empire perse, 249. 65 It may be noted that the Achaemenids became specialists in hydraulic construc- tion, and subsequent generations of Near Eastern administrators regarded them as models to be emulated in this respect - see Subtelny, Le monde est un jardin, 33. 66 Stronach, "The Royal Garden at Pasargadae," 480-83; and Stronach, "The Gar- den as a Political Statement," 174-76. The basic architectural design and characteristic features of the ancient Persian garden were continued under the Sasanian rulers of western Iran, whose administrative capital at Ctesiphon was located in former Babylo- nia - see Pinder-Wilson, "The Persian Garden," 72-74; and Stronach, "The Royal Garden at Pasargadae," 485.

Macdougall and Ettinghausen, 48-49), as well as in the detailed description of a quad- ripartite architectural garden (termed chahãrbãgh, literally "four gardens") found in the Persian agricultural manual, Irshãd al-zirãeah, which was composed in eastern Iran in the early sixteenth century. To summarize the salient features of the latter description: the garden was rectangular in shape and surrounded by a high wall; irrigation channels ran along the inside perimeter of the wall, as well as along the longitudinal axis of the garden; it was based on a quadripartite plan and divided into four raised terraces, each of which was planted with fruit trees of the same variety; it contained a pavilion Cima- rai) which stood on a raised platform (kursf, literally "throne"), in front of which was a reflecting pool (hawd).

Friedberg, "A New Clue in the Dating of the Composition of the Book of Esther," Vetus Testamentum 50.4 (2000): 561-65.

The term bitan (see n. 61) occurs on two other occa- sions in the Book of Esther (7:7-8), both in connection with the garden; in the latter occurrence, the king is described as returning from the garden of the pavilion {ginnat ha-bitan) to the banquet hall ijbeit mishteh) which was presumably located in the palace proper. 69 Thus in Esther 1:14 (ro'ei pnei ha-melek).

He built a treasury Çotsar) at its entrance and said, "Whoever will labour conscientiously in the work of the pardes may enter the treasury, but palaces. But before the visitor could gain access to the interior, he had to overcome numerous obstacles and pass through many checkpoints."

Subtelny JSQ 11 he who will not show himself worthy in the work of the pardes may not enter it."75 As for the palace itself, this is often alluded to indirectly in the parabolic narratives, as in the following example from Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer (ca. ninth century CE), which refers to the king's upper chambers Çaliyyotho), perhaps a balcony, which overlooked the pardes: A parable - to what is the matter to be compared? To a king who had a pardes and a dog chained at its entrance. The king was sitting in his upper chambers, watching and observing all that transpired in the pardes.16 Other rabbinic parables refer to the pardes as the king's most prized possession; mention the prohibition against entering it without the king's permission; and associate it with the administration of justice.77 Thus, the pardes into which the four sages entered in our tale was not merely a garden or an orchard. To enter into the pardes was equivalent to entering into the palace of the great king, with the express purpose of seeing him enthroned therein in all his royal spendour. By deliberately choosing the ancient Near Eastern cultural term pardes, the rabbinic authors of the tale intended to conjure up the powerful image of the imperial Persian palace precinct, with its associations of awe-inspiring majesty, inaccessibility, and mortal danger.78 75 Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, IX. 9 (cited in Goshen-Gottstein, "Four Entered Para- dise Revisited," 96). For an example where a tower is mentioned: "God was here like a king who had a pardes, wherein he built a tall tower (migdal) and commanded that workmen should be engaged to do his work there." - Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, II. 2 (cited in Goshen-Gottstein, "Four Entered Paradise Revisited," 97 and 98). 76 Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer (Jerusalem: Eshkol, 1972-73), 170; Pirkê de Rabbi Eliezer, trans. Gerald Friedlander (London, 1916), 348; also cited in Goshen-Gottstein, "Four Entered Paradise Revisited," 98 and 99 (who wonders whether these were located inside or outside the "orchard"). The reference to an upper chamber or balcony Çaliyyah) overlooking the royal pardes is also found in Tosefta, Hagigah, 2: 5 and P Talmud, Hagigah, lie, in parables illustrating the entrance of the four sages into the pardes - see Haloerin. Merkabah. 93. 77 See, for example, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, V.7; also Pirkei Rabbi Eli'ezer, 170; Pirkê de Rabbi Eliezer, trans. Friedlander, 348. For references to "the pardes of Justice" in Qumran literature, see Jan N. Bremmer, "The Birth of the Term 'Paradise'," in his The Rise and Fall of the Afterlife (London-New York: Routledge, 2002), 116 (originally published as "Paradise: From Persia, via Greece, into the Septuagint, in Paradise Interpreted: Representations of Biblical Paradise in Judaism and Christianity, ed. Gerard P. Luttikhuizen [Leiden-Boston-Cologne: Brill, 1999], 1-20). 78 This is also confirmed by the parable that immediately follows the versions of the tale in Tosefta and P Talmud, in which the entrance of the four into the pardes is likened to the pardes of a king {pardes shel melek) into which one can look, but not "feast one's eyes" - Tosefta, Hagigah, 2: 2; P Talmud, Hagigah, lie; Schäfer, Synopse zum Talmud Yerushalmi, 323 (according to which one can look but not touch); noted by Jacobs, Jewish Mystical Testimonies, 30; see also Halperin, Merkabah, 93.</page><page sequence="21">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 23 A Classic Persian Frame-Story It has been noted that, unlike most Talmudic parables (mashal), the tale of the four sages lacks an explicit moral teaching or didactic explanation (nimshal); hence, although often referred to as a parabolic account, it is not, properly speaking, a parable.79 Nor does it fit the standard defini- tion of the rabbinic exemplum (ma'aseh), an anecdote that claims to be historical in nature, since it lacks the customary introductory formula.80 Most scholars who have analyzed the tale have noted that it defies cate- gorization according to the traditional rabbinic genres of story-telling.81 It appears to be a purely literary creation, the origins of which remain problematic.82 Perhaps the most convincing suggestion is that of Alon Goshen-Gottstein who argues that it represents a narrative typology or typological listing that is intended to illustrate the distinctions between certain stereotypes or ideal situations.83 I would like to suggest that not only is the metaphor of the pardes taken from the ancient Persian cultural sphere, so too is the structure of the tale, since with its typological listing, fourfold symmetry, and laconic formulation, it bears a striking resemblance to the classic Persian frame- story. The close mutual contacts between Persians and Jews in Achae- menid Babylonia, especially during the period of Sasanian rule when the Talmudic corpus was compiled, point to the very real possibility of Per- sian cultural influence on literary formulations of Jewish religious thought.84 79 Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 30; also Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 49. In an argument too contrived to be convincing, Ephraim Urbach suggested that the version of the tale in P Talmud is the mashal and the version in the Tosefta is the nimshal - see Urbach, "Ha-Masorot eal Torat ha-SodV 498. 80 On this point see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 49. For the ma'aseh, and the difference between it and the mashal, see Stern, Parables in Midrash, 13-16. 81 It is telling that Stern does not even mention the tale of the four sages in his Parables in Midrash. 82 On the literary aspect of Talmudic narratives, see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, esp. 25-28. 83 Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 50-54. By interpreting the tale as an allegory of four types of Torah scholars, Peter Schäfer also implied that it was a typol- ogy - see Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 242-43. Henry Fischel had earlier suggested that it was an Epicurean typology - see Henry A. Fischel, Rab- binic Literature and Greco-Roman Philosophy: A Study of Epicurea and Rhetorica in Early Midrashic Writings (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973), 4^34. 84 See Dandamaev and Lukonin, Culture and Social Institutions of Ancient Iran, 292 ff., esp. 301, 313 (with a reference to Ezra) and 319; also Muhammad A.

Subtelny JSQ 1 1 Shaul Shaked has demonstrated that the fourfold narrative typology is a typical feature of Iranian frame-stories that involve a conference of four kings, four sages, or representatives of four different nationalities.85 The sage-theme, which was particularly well represented, stemmed from the Avestan conception of wisdom, which encompassed both acquired knowledge and spiritual insight, and the ancient Iranian sages, who were equated with the Zoroastrian priesthood, were sources not only of sententious maxims and practical advice, but also of esoteric lore, such as astrology, oneiromancy, and magic.86 The "ordering" power of the number four is attested in many Near Eastern cultures, and it fig- ures prominently in ancient Persian thought, in which it connoted the idea of universality.87 The idea of imperial dominion, for example, was conveyed by reference to the four quarters of the realm, and the tradi- tional hierarchical structuring of society was represented by the four estates.88 Particularly germane to our analysis is the fact that the Persian four- fold typology often takes the form of two extreme positions flanking two moderate or intermediate ones.89 The two extreme positions are crucial to the structure of the typology, for they provide its framework, while the two intermediate positions represent the filler, so to speak, and act as foils for the extremes. This is precisely the typological structure pre- sented by the tale of the four sages, in which R. eAqiva and Elishae 85 See Shaul Shaked, "From Iran to Islam: Notes on Some Themes in Transmis- sion," in his From Zoroastrian Iran to Islam (originally published in Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 4 [1984]: 31-67), VI: 41-49. For a story about four kinds of people, see Shaul Shaked, trans., The Wisdom of the Sasanian Sages (Dënkard VI) (Boulder: Westview Press, 1979), 71 § 178. This fourfold structure has no affinity with the rabbinic enumeration of examples, which rarely involves the number four, preferring instead the odd numbers three, five, seven, etc. - see Wayne Sibley Towner, The Rabbinic "Enu- meration of Scriptural Examples": A Study of a Rabbinic Pattern of Discourse with Special Reference to Mekhilta d'R. Ishmael (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973), 14 ff.; and Louis Jacobs, "The Numbered Sequence as a Literary Device in the Babylonian Talmud," Hebrew Annual Review 1 (1983): 148; but see also Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Am- nesiac, 51-52 (where he provides some rare examples of the fourfold typology in rab- binic literature). 86 See James R. Russell, "The Sage in Ancient Iranian Literature," in The Sage in Israel and the Ancient Near East, ed. John G. Gammie and Leo G. Perdue (Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 1990), 82-92. The model of the ancient Iranian sage was the prophet Zoroaster himself who was perceived as being endowed with every kind of wisdom. 87 See Annemarie Schimmel, The Mystery of Numbers (New York-Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 86 ff. 88 See Louise Marlow, Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 67-70 and n. 13. 89 Shaked, "From Iran to Islam," 43.</page><page sequence="23">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 25 ben Abuyah represent the two extremes, while Ben e Azzai and Ben Zoma occupy the two intermediate positions.90 It is not my contention that the content of the tale of the four sages was taken from the Persian literary tradition - only the fourfold typo- logical structure based on the sage-theme, which appears to have been loosely adapted to the rabbinic exemplum (maeaseh). Sage stories abound in rabbinic literature and form a separate category of the maca- seh, which deals with the lives and deeds of known rabbis from the Pharisaic period on.91 Significantly, the oldest preserved version of the four sages theme in Jewish literature has been traced to the story of the imperial bodyguards at the court of the Achaemenid king, Darius I, in the apocryphal third book of Ezra (1 Esdras),92 to which may be added the tale about the king's four wise servitors in the biblical Book of Da- niel (Dan. 2:4-48), which likewise originated from the same Perso-Baby- lonian cultural matrix.93 Although the ostensible historicity of the rabbinic figures mentioned in the tale is used as proof of its truth, this is a rhetorical claim only, which is entirely in keeping with the strategy of the narrative typology. Moreover, the hyperbolic nature of the tale, a characteristic feature of the exemplum, militates against any kind of a literal or historical inter- pretation.94 There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is not a historical anecdote, but a hybrid literary creation to which the names of the sages, in particular that of the great Tannaitic sage, R. eAqiva,95 90 See Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 51-53. 91 See Stern, Parables in Midrash, 241-42. 92 Thus Shaked, "From Iran to Islam," 48-49. The story involves three members of the imperial bodyguard, each of whom proposes an answer to the question, what is the strongest thing? Although only three bodyguards are mentioned, they in fact provide four answers - wine, the king, women, and truth. See 1 Esdras 3:1-10, The Holy Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments with the Apocryphal/ Deuter ocanonical Books, new rev. standard version (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Pubi., 1989). A thematic and structural parallel between this story and the narrative of the Book of Esther, which also takes place at the Persian court, has been suggested by James Russell - see his "Zoroastrian Elements in the Book of Esther," 33 n. 2. 93 The story is related in imperial Aramaic, the official language of the Achaemenid empire. The number four also figures in Daniel's dream vision about the four world empires (Dan. 7), an idea that is attested in late Iranian sources. See Shaul Shaked, "Ir- anian Influence on Judaism: First Century B. C. E. to Second Century C. E.," in The Cambridge History of Judaism, vol. 1 : Introduction; The Persian Period, ed. W. D. Davies and Louis Finkelstein (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), esp. 314 and 324. 94 As noted by Stern, Parables in Midrash, 13: "One of the more striking character- istics of the ma'aseh is that the more improbable and fantastic its narratives, the stron- ger are its claims to historicity, and the more effective its exemplariness." 95 Rabbi eAqiva ben Joseph (ca. 110-35 CE), probably the most important of the Tannaitic sages, was a Midrashist who developed his own school of scriptural inter-</page><page sequence="24">26 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 were added pseudepigraphically in order to underscore the significance of its message, which was to illustrate a certain type of behavior or understanding as exemplified by each.96 Since, as is customary in the case of the ma'aseh, the teaching is not stated directly, the scriptural proof-texts which are cited in the tale as commentary on the experiences of each of the four sages may be construed as the epimythium, the concluding statement of the exemplum that alludes to a didactic mes- sage.97 It goes without saying that the message would have reflected the theological concerns of the world of the sages and would have related to scriptural interpretation, the raison d'être of rabbinic culture.98 The Tale in Hekhalot Literature Before proceeding to an interpretation of the tale, it is necessary to dis- cuss another literary context in which it is attested, the so-called Hekha- lot narratives, which are generally acknowledged as representing one of the earliest forms of Jewish mysticism.99 The tale figures prominently in some of the Hekhalot texts, especially the Greater and Lesser Hekhalot, which expand on the Talmudic versions of the tale (particularly the ver- sion in the Babylonian Talmud), or which simply allude to some aspect of the tale, usually in connection with the name of one of the sages mentioned in it.100 Scholem characterized Hekhalot mysticism, which pretation, some of whose members were R. Meir, R. Shim'on b. Yohai, and R. Yose. Virtually nothing is known about the historical Elisha* ben Abuyah - see Goshen- Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 228-29. As for Ben eAzzai and Ben Zoma, it is not even clear whether the two were contemporaries - see Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusa- lem: Keter, 1971), 4: 471 and 575. 96 See Stern, Parables in Midrash, 242; also Goshen-Gottstein, "Four Entered Para- dise Revisited," 106-107; and Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 36 (for his in- sightful observation that the historical veracity of a text is inversely proportional to the presence in it of ideological concerns). 97 See Stern, Parables in Midrash, 14-15. For the idea that the proof- texts function as a commentary on the fates of the four sages, see Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 242; Rowland, Open Heaven, 320; also Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 50-5 1 . 98 On this point, see Rowland, Open Heaven, 318-19; Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 242-43; and Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, esp. 226 and 268-69. 99 For the tale in Hekhalot literature, see Kuyt, 'Descent' to the Chariot, esp. 214ff.; also Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part I), 195ff. loo por example, the so-called water illusion in B Talmud, Hagigah, 14b, and the encounter with the angel Metatron in B Talmud, Hagigah, 15a, are both expanded in the Hekhalot literature - see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §345/§672.

Ishmael - must pass through seven palaces or palace halls, the entrances to which are guarded by angelic officials who require of him seals and secret pass- words before he can be admitted and proceed on to the next palace.104 Only after successfully passing through all the checkpoints is he per- mitted to enter into the seventh palace, where the divine Throne is lo- cated and where he is vouchsafed a vision of God enthroned "in His sode, see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot- Literatur, §408-410; for an allusion to the incident involving Elishae ben Abuyah, see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §597; as for R. eAqiva, he is frequently mentioned as one of the "heroes" of the narra- tives. 101 Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books, 1941; repr. ed., 1995), 44 and 54-55 (citing H.

S. Alexander, "Comparing Merkavah Mysticism and Gnosticism: An Essay in Method," Journal of Jewish Studies 35.1 (1984): 13-14. 102 For the idea that God is imagined after the model of the ancient Persian ruler, the king of kings of the Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sasanians - see Geo Widengren, Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and his Ascension (King and Saviour V), Uppsala Universitets Àrsskrift (1955: 1), 213. While it is possible that the Assyrian model may also have played a role, given the fact that the term pardes was specific to the Achae- menid cultural milieu, the model would sooner appear to be Persian. Although Alex- ander identified the model of kingship presented in the Hekhalot texts with the Roman emperor, he also noted that the evidence pointed to an "oriental complexion" - see Alexander, "Comparing Merkavah Mysticism and Gnosticism," 14-15. In this connec- tion, a feature that deserves to be mentioned, in view of its prominence in the Hekhalot narratives, is the focus on God's "beauty," which may have derived from the emphasis placed on the physical beauty of the king in the ancient Persian conception of kingship - see Briant. Histoire de l'Empire verse, 237-38. 103 See Scholem, Major Trends, 40 ff.; Scholem, Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 20; also Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekahlot Literature," 243-46. 104 The use of seals was particularly widespread in the Persian bureaucratic tradi- tion, which continued into the Sasanian period - see Richard N.

The fact that the tale of the four sages is attested both in rabbinic literature and in the Hekhalot texts has raised the question of the nature of the relationship between rabbinic culture and early mystical currents in Judaism. Some scholars have argued that the Talmudic tale represents a separate tradition altogether from Hekhalot mysticism, while others have opined that it attests to the presence of a mystical strain in rabbinic culture.107 As I will attempt to demonstrate, the tale calls for an esoteric interpretation rather than a mystical one, and it serves to reinforce the notion that rabbinic thought was not unmarked by esotericism.108 The distinction between esotericism and mysticism is a crucial one, which 105 The allusion is to Is. 33:17, "Your eyes will see the king in His beauty (beyofyo)." For the concept of God's beauty, see Rachel Elior, "The Concept of God in Hekhalot Literature," in Binah, vol. 2: Studies in Jewish Thought, ed. Joseph Dan (New York: Praeger, 1989), 101 and 106-107.

Scholem, for example, referred to the experience of the four sages as a mystical one - see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 16; also Scholem, Major Trends, 52. While Halperin argues against the idea of a mystical current, he nevertheless refers to the rabbinic texts that incorporate the tale as "the mystical collection" - see his Merkabah, 65 ff. Joseph Dan interpreted the tale of the four sages as marking the "historical point for the beginning of Jewish mysticism" - see Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 38 and 29-30; this idea appears to have become an accepted fact - see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 219; Ira Chernus, Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism: Studies in the History of Midrash (Berlin-New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1982); and Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part I), 183-85 and (Part II), 268 (where he states that the tale is "rooted in an apocalyptic and visionary-mystical tradition"). For a contrary opinion, see Rubenstein, "Elisha ben Abuya," 210-11 (the article includes a critique of Yehuda Liebes' Het'o shel Elisha', 2nd ed. [Jerusalem: Academon, 1990]). In the view of Schäfer, Hekhalot literature is a post-rabbinic creation which sought to link itself pseudepigra- phically with rabbinic literature - see Peter Schäfer, "The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism," in his Hekhalot-Studien, 293. 108 As Guy Stroumsa has pointed out, doctrinal esotericism did not disappear in Judaism, as it did in early Christianity - see Guy G. Stroumsa, "From Esotericism to Mysticism in Early Christianity," in Secrecy and Concealment: Studies in the History of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Religions, ed. Hans G. Kippenberg and Guy G. Stroumsa (Leiden-New York-Cologne: E. J. Brill, 1995), 293 ff.

Wewers, Geheimnis und Geheimhaltung im rabbinischen Judentum (Berlin-New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1975), 234-35 and 201-202. Relevant to an understanding of the context of Jewish doctrinal esotericism are the comments of Guy Stroumsa regarding the Christian concept of mysterion - see Stroumsa, "From Esotericism to Mysticism," 304 (citing John Chrysostom): "The most characteristic trait of mystery is that it is announced everywhere, and nonetheless remains unknown from those who do not think correctly: since it is not through wisdom that it is re- vealed, but through the Spirit, inasmuch as we can receive it. One would not err in calling the mystery ineffable, since even to us the believers, it is not possible to under- stand such things in full light and with an exact knowledge." 111 For a succint formulation of this equivocal position, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 124. On the nature of rabbinic culture, which was never a homogeneous phenomenon, see Moshe Idei, "Rabbinism versus Kabbalism: On G. Scholem's Phe- nomenology of Judaism," Modern Judaism 11 (1991): 289-93; also Moshe Idei, Kabba- lah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), 156-57. 112 It is impossible to determine which is the "oldest" or "original" version of the tale, whether it is to be found in the Tosefta, as some scholars believe, or in the He- khalot literature, specifically in the Lesser Hekhalot (Hekhalot Zutrati) - for a discus- sion of the various views on the topic, see Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 35; and more recently Morray-Jones, Transparent Illusion, 86. The Hekhalot texts represent an ex- tremely complex redactional process of transmission. While scholars have ascribed the tradition they represent to the third century CE and even earlier, the texts themselves do not date from before the ninth century, that is, the Islamic period. For a discussion of the problem of dating and the complex nature of this literature, see Peter Schäfer, "Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature," in his Hekhalot-Studien (originally published in Journal for the Study of Judaism 14 [1983]: 172-81), 15-16; Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 74-75; and most recently Kuyt, 'Descent' to the Chariot, 3.</page><page sequence="28">30 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 However, given that the goal of the Hekhalot itineraries is a vision of the divine Chariot-throne, the role of the tale in the Hekhalot narratives appears to be similar to the one it plays in rabbinic literature, since both are concerned with the esoteric doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah. The Hekhalot texts thus represent an invaluable supplementary source for elucidating the meaning of the tale, and not to consider the tale in its Hekhalot setting alongside its rabbinic one is to make artificial distinc- tions, since its function in both is one and the same - to illustrate the theologumenon pertaining to divine theophany, symbolically repre- sented by the motif of the divine Chariot-throne. Besides serving as a link between rabbinic and Hekhalot literature, the tale of the four sages also provides an explanation for the motif of the palaces, which is so central to the imagery of the Hekhalot narra- tives. The explanation lies in the metaphorical term pardes on which the tale is based, which occurs in the Hekhalot literature only in connection with the tale or in allusions to it.113 As established earlier, the entrance of the four sages into the pardes was equivalent to their having entered into the palace-garden precinct of the great king, in which the royal throne was located.114 The palaces or palace chambers {hekhalot), as well as the Chariot-throne (merkavah), which represented the objects of visionary activity in the Hekhalot narratives, are thus to be under- stood as intrinsic components of the royal pardes complex.115 This was also the understanding of the medieval Jewish commentators, whose in- sights appear to have been overlooked by modern scholarship. Thus, in a responsum to a question regarding the interpretation of the tale, Hai ben Sherira Gaon (d. 1038), the head of a Babylonian (i. e., Iraqi) rab- binic academy, provided the following explanation of the relationship of the hekhalot and the merkavah to the pardes:116 113 For the occurrences in the Hekhalot literature, see Peter Schäfer, ed., Konkor- danz zur Hekhalot-Literatur, 2 vols. (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1986-87), 2: 557 (= Syn- opse zur Hekhalot- Literatur, §597, §338, §344-345, §671-672). 114 See p. 22 above. 115 Failure to grasp this fundamental point has given rise to much far-fetched spec- ulation in the scholarly literature. Thus, for example, Urbach stated that there was no concrete connection between the pardes and the merkavah, but he nevertheless insisted that what the sages saw was a vision of the merkavah. His argument was based on the fact that the term pardes is not mentioned in that version of the tale which he construed as the explanatory nimshal - see Urbach, "Ha-Masorot 'al Tor at ha- Sod" 498; see also Halperin, Merkabah, 91. 116 The question was framed in the following way: "What is this pardes^. And what did he peer at and was afflicted? And what is this affliction? And what is [the meaning of] 'he cut down the saplings' (qitsets bi-netVotJt And what are those saplings? R. eAqiva entered - what place did he enter, and from whence did he enter and exit in</page><page sequence="29">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 3 1 Regarding these envisionings (tsefiyyot), the Tannaitic sage taught [the tale], "Four [sages] entered the pardes" He compared those palaces (hekha- lot) to a pardes, and he applied this very term [pardes] to them. As for the analogy of those four [who entered the pardes], he thought that they peered (hetsitsu) at the divine Chariot-throne (merkavah).111 Hai Gaon thus equated the hekhalot-palaces with the royal palace pre- cinct denoted by the term pardes, and he associated entry into the pardes with contemplation of the divine Throne. What then of the problem of heavenly ascent? In keeping with the traditional interpretation of the Hekhalot narratives as journeys through celestial palaces, the Talmudic tale of the four sages has fre- quently been interpreted by scholars as a heavenly ascent.118 But as has already been indicated, the Hebrew term pardes does not denote a heavenly paradise in rabbinic literature, and in all versions of the tale, the entrance of the sages into the pardes is denoted simply by the verb "to enter" (nikhnas) rather than "to ascend."119 Moreover, as Peter Schäfer has demonstrated, the idea of heavenly ascent hardly figures in the Hekhalot texts as a whole.120 At the same time, however, R. eAqiva's having "entered and exited in peace" is in some versions and/or manu- script witnesses alternatively expressed as his having "ascended and des- cended [in peace]."121 It appears that a complicated process was at work in the redaction of the tale, whereby the alternative expression, "ascended and descended," represented a later editorial hypercorrection that reversed the original sequence, which was in fact, "descended and ascended."122 The Hebrew peace?" - see 'Otsar ha-geonim, ed. B. M. Lewin, vol. 4 (Jerusalem: Hebrew University Press Association, 1931), (Tractate Hagigah, Responsa): 13-14. 117 'Otsar ha-geonim, 4 (Tractate Hagigah, Responsa): 14 (the translation is mine). For an interpretation of this passage, although with the omission of the last sentence which would appear to be crucial to its understanding, see Idei, Kabbalah, 90. 118 For a more nuanced view of the problem of ascent, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 108 ("Ascent to the Throne: imagined or real?"). 119 Seen. 14 above. 120 Schäfer, "Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism," 282. 121 See p. 6 above. The first pair is attested in B Talmud (14b, only yatsà), P Tal- mud, Song of Songs Rabbah, and in some of the Hekhalot narratives - see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §671-672 (§344). The second pair is attested in B Talmud (15b), Tosefta, and in some of the Hekhalot narratives - see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §345/§672. On this point see, among others, Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 36. 122 This contradicts Scholem's view that the original terminology employed in the Hekhalot texts was that of ascent Çalah), while that of descent (yarad) represented a later tradition - see Scholem, Major Trends, 46-47 (where he even states that the change took place "probably around 500 [CE]"); see also Scholem's comments in his Jewish Gnosticism, 20 n. 1. My contention is supported by the semantic studies of</page><page sequence="30">32 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 verb yarad ("to descend") was regularly used in a technical sense in early Jewish mysticism of the Hekhalot variety in connection with merkavah- Throne speculation.123 It did not, however, denote a descent, either real or imagined. Rather, the expression yeridah la-merkavah, which is usual- ly rendered as "descent to the Chariot-throne," but also as "entry to the Chariot-throne," and even "entry into the Throne-world," referred to imaginai envisioning of the divine Throne, and those who practiced this visionary technique in the context of Merkavah mysticism were re- ferred to as yordei ha-merkavah ("those who descend to/enter into the Chariot-throne world").124 Thus, R. eAqiva's having "descended and ascended," which appears to have been later redactionally corrected to "ascended and descended," did not refer to any physical ascent or descent, but rather to his con- templation of the Chariot-throne vision and his emergence from that contemplative state. This was clearly the understanding of such medieval commentators as Hananel ben Hushi'el, who summed up the experience of the four sages in the tale by stating that, "They did not ascend to the heavens, but rather they [imaginally] envisioned (tsofìm) [the divine Chariot-throne] ...,"125 In order to understand why the yarad-terminoì- ogy was later replaced by a vocabulary of ascent, it would be necessary to investigate not only the murky process by which the Hebrew term pardes, which did not denote a heavenly paradise either in the early rabbinic literature or in the Hekhalot texts, came to assume this mean- ing, particularly in the Kabbalistic interpretations of the tale, but also the reasons why the meaning of the original technical expression was Annalies Kuyt, "Once Again: Yarad in Hekhalot Literature," Frankfurter Judaistische Beiträge 18 (1990): 67-69; and her 'Descent' to the Chariot, 370-71. 123 For the technical use of the verb yarad in connection with Merkavah speculation, see Wolfson, " Yeridah la-Merkavah" 13-14, and esp. n. 17 (for a survey of the different views on the problem); and Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 82 n. 39; see also Kuyt, 'Descent' to the Chariot, 3ff; and Kuyt, "Once Again: Yarad," 45-69. 124 For the latter renderings, see Wolfson, "Yeridah la-Merkavah," 15 and 26. For a new interpretation of the locution, yeridah la-merkavah, see my forthcoming article, "The Role of Merkavah Mysticism in the Development of the Speculative Trend in Islam." 125 'Otsar ha-geonim, 4 (Tractate Hagigah, Commentaries): 61; see also p. 47 below. Note the use of the technical term, tsofeh (pl. tsofìm), from the verb tsafah, to denote the one who imaginally envisions the merkavah - for which see n. 137 below. Those exegetes and Talmudic commentators who lived outside the Near Eastern cultural sphere, and to whom such Near Eastern realia as the pardes were foreign, clearly did not comprehend the pardes metaphor. Most notable in this respect is the eleventh-century French exegete, R. Solomon ben Isaac (Rashi) of Troyes, who interpreted the tale as an ascent to heaven - for a discussion of his views on the tale and those of later commentators who disagreed with him, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 111-12 and 146.</page><page sequence="31">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 33 lost or perhaps even suppressed.126 At any rate, while certainly not un- important, these considerations have little bearing on my interpretation of the tale, to which we now turn. A Typology of the Theophanic Imagination Adonoi Echad! It is not One, but Two, not two but Infinite - the universe be born and die in endless series in the mind! Allen Ginsberg127 Since the goal of the sages' entrance into the pardes was to obtain a vision of the divine Glory enthroned, we may expand the horizon of figurative meaning further by interpreting the metaphorical pardes as the realm in which imaginai envisioning of theophanic forms takes place, these being symbolically represented by the Throne motif.128 126 As already indicated, the term pardes did not denote a heavenly paradise in early rabbinic literature, nor was it used as an equivalent oigan 'Eden (Garden of Eden) - see p. 14 above. The Greek term paradeisos was used to denote a heavenly paradise, how- ever, both in New Testament Scripture and in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible. For a discussion of Paul's claim to have ascended to paradeisos (2 Corinthians 12:4), see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 14 ff.; Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 234 ff; and Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part II), 265 ff. For the translation of Hebrew gan eEden as paradeisos in the Septuagint, see Bremmer, Rise and Fall of the Afterlife, 118-19, where he argues that the translators opted for the term paradeisos instead of the Greek kepos because of its royal associations, and he hypothesizes that the immediate models were the Persian-inspired royal gardens of the Ptolemies in Alexandria. Scholem also noted that the term pardes was used as a tech- nical term for the heavenly paradise in the Aramaic/Syriac phrase, pardes qushta - see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 16. 127 Allen Ginsberg, Kaddish and Other Poems 1958-1960 (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1961), 69. 128 Following Ricoeur's tensional conception of what he referred to as "metapho- rical truth" - see Paul Ricoeur, The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language, trans. Robert Czerny (Toronto-Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1977), esp. 247 ff. Many scholars have interpreted the pardes as a meta- phor for the celestial or cosmic Temple, or the holy of holies of the Temple - see most recently Morray- Jones, Transparent Illusion, 20, where he states categorically that the term pardes is "a technical term for the holy of holies of the heavenly temple," a thesis proposed already by Andé Neher, "Le voyage mystique des quatre," Revue de l'histoire des religions 140.1 (1951): esp. 77-79. This idea has been echoed by many others, who have misunderstood the meaning of the term pardes - for example, in a disappointing study devoted to the image of the garden in rabbinic literature, Sandra Shimoff con- cludes that, "the Pardes, the Temple, the Holy of Holies, are all one" - see Sandra R.</page><page sequence="32">34 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 The metaphorical pardes thus denotes the imaginai world, the mundus imaginalis in Henry Corbin's formulation of the medieval Islamic theo- sophical concept of the cãlam al-mithãl (the world of Ideal or Archetypal forms), which the medieval Jewish Kabbalists rendered as eolam ha-de- mut - the realm of the active or creative imagination.129 This is the intermediary realm that mediates between the physical and spiritual worlds, where spiritual forms assume corporeity and corporeal forms are spiritualized through the agency of the imaginative faculty, which, mirror-like, reflects the theophanic forms that are manifested in it.130 In this visionary geography, which is not defined by time or space, the pardes is not just a privileged space, but a place that privileges the ima- gination.131 By relating our expanded interpretation of the pardes metaphor to the esoteric doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah, which the tale of the four sages was intended to illustrate both in the Talmudic and Hekhalot contexts, we can reasonably infer that to enter the pardes of the imaginai realm signified to speculate about the theologumenon pertaining to divine theophany through imaginai envisioning of the divine Glory en- Shimoff, "Gardens: From Eden to Jerusalem," Journal for the Study of Judaism 26.2 (1995): 155. While I do not dispute that the intent of the imago templi, as conceived by Henry Corbin, is ultimately the same as that of the imago regiae in the tale of the four sages, the images themselves are different and ought not to be conflated, as this results in a distortion of the pardes metaphor.

My interpretation of the tale is largely informed by what Corbin tell- ingly referred to as the paradox of monotheism: that God's unlikeness and absolute transcendence can only be comprehended through the mediation of His theophanies, but these are not to be understood as representations, because what is represented cannot be conceived of as a representation. Alternatively expressed, the theophanic manifestation of the divine Glory (kavod) in the Chariot-throne vision is but the exo- teric form of monotheism, which can meaningfully be understood only in its esoteric form, for God's essence is essentially hidden and con- cealed.133 The paradoxical nature of the concept of divine theophany, which was captured by the medieval Islamic theosophists in the formula, "He is hidden in His manifestation, manifest in His concealing," was summed up by Corbin as, "The simultaneous refusal and attestation of the vision [of God]."134 God's Unicity and His theophanic manifesta- 132 Most scholars accept that the pardes metaphor stands for some sort of esoteric speculation, but without specifying the nature of that speculation. In fact, so accepted has the metaphorical meaning of the term pardes become in post-Biblical Hebrew that it is even given as a dictionary definition - see Klein, Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Lammave. 523 ("esoteric DhilosoDhv"i. 133 The term kavod is regularly used as a technical term for the theophanic mani- festation in the Chariot-throne vision - see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 135. In Scholem's formulation, the numinous concept of the divine Glory is that aspect of God that is revealed and manifest - see Scholem, Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 21. It is not, however, ontically distinct from God's essence - see Wolfson, "Sacred Space," 610.

Subtelny JSQ 11 tions together form part of what he termed an integral ontology, in which the mirror of the One and that of its multiple theophanies are reflected in each other. But it is divine Unicity that constitutes the basis of the epiphanic forms and makes them possible. Corbin referred to this not as monotheism, which in its exoteric form was in constant danger of lapsing into "metaphysical idolatry," but as theomonism, and he argued for the necessity of a theophanic imagination that is able to envision simultaneously the One in multiplicity and multiplicity in divine Uni- city.135 The four sages who entered the metaphorical pardes were tested on their ability to grasp this fundamental concept which constitutes the mysterium tremendum at the heart of Jewish monotheism, and their sev- eral fates were commensurate with their levels of understanding.136 As indicated by the repeated use of the verb hetsits ("to peer"), which is the leading element in the tale's narrative strategy, the epistemic mode op- erative in the tale is that of visionary perception. Supporting this con- tention is the fact that hetsits is regularly used in a technical sense in the Hekhalot narratives for contemplation of the Chariot-throne vision.137 135 See Corbin, "Le paradoxe du monothéisme," in his Le paradoxe, esp. 8-11; also Corbin, L'imagination créatrice, 211. In Islamic theosophical thought, this is the con- cept of the unicity of Being (wahdat al-wujüd), as formulated primarily by the Spanish- Arab theosophist, Ibn eArabï (d. 1240), and elaborated on by his Persian interpreters - see Pierre Lory, Les commentaires ésotériques du Coran d'après eAbd al-Razzâq al-Qâ- shânî (Paris: Les Deux Océans, 1980), 46-47. In view of this interpretation of mono- theistic religion, one can scarcely agree with the views expressed by Peter Hayman who opined that the term "monotheism" has been misused in the case of Judaism, since the pattern of Jewish beliefs about God sooner reflected a "cooperative dualism" which presupposed two divine entities, there always being a prominent "number two" in the divine hierarchy: "The results of my observations will lead me to the conclusion that most varieties of Judaism are marked by a dualistic pattern in which two divine entities are presupposed: one the supreme creator God, the other his vizier or prime minister, or some other spiritual agency, who really 'runs the show', or at least provides the point of contact between God and humanity.

Most modern interpreters of the tale have focused on the idea of inappropriate "gazing," which they connect with "pleasure seeking" and even "eroticism," but such explanations fail to take into account the fact that hetsits is used in this technical sense - see, for example, Eilberg-Schwartz, God's Phallus, 175ff.; and Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 55 ff. 138 See in particular Wolfson, Through a Speculum, chapts. 3-4, and esp. 144-48 (with specific reference to medieval interpretations of the tale of the four sages), and 114ff. (for the positioning of his ideas on the topic of vision in the spectrum of Jewish studies scholarship). 139 One of the most lucid descriptions of the different modes of vision in the Islamic theosophical tradition is to be found in Nass al-nusüs, a commentary on the Fusüs al- hikam of Ibn * Arabï, by the fourteenth-century Persian theosophist (writing in Arabic), Sayyed Haydar Amolï- see Corbin, Le paradoxe, esp. 16-17; and also below. The same epistemic/visionary modes are already described, albeit in less elaborate fashion, in the first systematic works on Sufi doctrine, such as al-Risãlah al-Qushayriyyah fì al-tasaw- wuf, by the Persian theosophist (also writing in Arabic), al-Qushayrl (d. 1074) - see Richard Grämlich, trans., Das Sendschreiben al-Qusayrfs über das Sufltum (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlae. 1989). 142 §2.22. 140 For the problem of anthropomorphism in Islam, see van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft, 4: 373 ff. and 408 (for comparisons with Judaism). 141 Nor do I believe that I have succumbed to the disease of "parallelomania" that Samuel Sandmel cautioned against, as I am not suggesting a literary connection be- tween parallel textual passages - see Samuel Sandmel, "Parallelomania," Journal of Biblical Literature 81 (1962): 1.

Subtelny JSQ 11 The first sage, Ben eAzzai, contemplated the theophanic manifestation represented by the divine Chariot-throne, but he was only a man of vision {dhü aWayn in the terminology of Islamic theosophy), who saw the Divine as something visible and manifest, and its theophanies as hidden.142 For him, the theophany was a mirror that reflected the Di- vine, but he did not see the mirror, only the Divine manifested in it.143 His mode of envisioning was inadequate to comprehend the paradox, and the proof- text cited in connection with his fate, "Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Ps. 116:15), with its oblique reference to sight, would appear to support such an interpretation.144 The second sage, Ben Zoma, contemplated the vision of the divine Chariot-throne, but he was only a man of intellect (the equivalent of dhü aWaql in Islamic terminology), who, conversely, saw what was theo- phanically manifested as exoteric, and the Divine as hidden and esoteric. For him, the Divine was a mirror that reflects the theophany, but he too did not see the mirror, for it was veiled by the form manifested in it.145 tian, which has generally, although not exclusively, been the focus of comparative en- deavors in the field of medieval Jewish studies. By the same token, the critical observa- tions of Gil Anidjar regarding the study of Kabbalah could be applied in reverse to the field of Islamic studies, which ignores almost completely comparative possibilities with Judaism, and Jewish mysticism in particular. See Gil Anidjar, "Jewish Mysticism Alter- able and Unalterable: On Orienting Kabbalah Studies and the 'Zohar of Christian Spain'," Jewish Social Studies 3.1 (1996): 89-157; and the response by Moshe Idei, "Orienting, Orientalizing or Disorienting the Study of Kabbalah: 'An Almost Abso- lutely Unique' Case of Occidentalism," Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mys- tical Texts 2 (1997): 13^7. 142 I have rendered the Hebrew verb he t sit s in its technical sense of contemplating or envisioning the merkavah. For this special usage, see p. 36 and n. 137 above. 143 In Haydar Amolï's formulation: "The man of vision sees the Divine as manifest and Creation as hidden. For him, Creation is a mirror that reflects the Divine, by reason of the manifestation for him of the Divine and the concealement of Creation in It, as a mirror is concealed by the form." - Sayyed Haydar Amolï, Le texte des textes (Nass al-nusüs), éd. Henry Corbin and Osman Yahia, vol. 1 (Tehran-Paris, 1975), 360 §790. In al-Qushayrï's terminology, this epistemic mode is referred to as eayn al-yaqin - see Grämlich, Das Sendschreiben al-Qusayrîs, 142 §22.2. 144 It also accords with the interpretation of the scriptural verse attributed to Ben e Azzai in Midrashic sources, who explained that the saint is accorded the divine favor of seeing at the time of his death - see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 56 (citing Genesis Rabbah 62: 2). It is reminiscent of the Kabbalistic notion that the dee- pest meaning of the Torah remains hidden even from the enlightened until the moment of death - see Isaiah Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar: An Anthology of Texts, trans. David Goldstein, 3 vols. (London- Washington: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1994), 3: 1127. 145 According to the formulation of Haydar Amolï: "The man of intellect sees Crea- tion as manifest and the Divine as hidden. For him, the Divine is a mirror that reflects Creation, by reason of the mirror's being veiled by the form that is manifested in it, as the Unlimited is veiled by the delimited." - Haydar Amolï, Nass al-nusüs, 360 §790. In</page><page sequence="37">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 39 His mode of vision, like Ben cAzzai's, also fell short of comprehending the paradox. The proof-text cited in his regard, "If you have found hon- ey, eat only enough for you, lest you be surfeited with it and vomit" (Prov. 25:16), indicates that the "honey" of esoteric knowledge he consumed could not be borne by reason alone, an interpretation which would ap- pear to be supported by the fact that his fate was to lose his mind.146 The modes of vision of Ben eAzzai and Ben Zoma represent the med- ial positions in the typology of the theophanic imagination. Both were not without merit, and Ben eAzzai, the man endowed with vision, was even regarded as a pious saint (hasid).141 But both were inadequate to apprehend the concept of divine theophany.148 al-Qushayrï's terminology, this epistemic mode is referred to as Him al-yaqln - see Grämlich, Das Sendschreiben al-Qusayrïs, 142 §22.2. Haydar Amolï's formulation re- garding delimitation of the Unlimited {al-mutlaq bi'l-muqayyad) is reminiscent of the early Kabbalistic interpretation of the Biblical verse referring to God's Throne: "Know that the Creator has no need for a throne for He has no limit, but the Glory is seen opposite the throne and the throne is limited, as it is written, 'The heavens are My Throne and the earth is My Footstool' (Is. 66:1)." - see Wolfson, "Sacred Space," 621 n. 98 (citing Eleazar of Worms, Sodey Razayya). 146 This interpretation would appear to be supported by a statement attributed to R. Joseph who cited Songs 4:11, "Honey and milk are under your tongue," to under- score the rabbinic restriction on expounding the esoteric account of the Chariot-throne {maaseh merkavah), since "The things that are sweeter than honey and milk should be kept under your tongue," that is, they should be kept hidden and not discussed - see B Talmud, Hagigah, 1 3a. For the equation of knowledge with eating in Maimonides, and with honey in particular, see James A. Diamond, "The Failed Theodicy of a Rabbinic Pariah: A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha Ben Abuyah," Jewish Studies Quarterly 9.4 (2002): 354-55. 147 For the martyrdom of the historical Ben e Azzai, see Rowland, Open Heaven, 322-23. 148 A very similar interpretation of the visionary modes of these two sages is pre- sented in an anonymous thirteenth-century Kabbalistic commentary which drew on the interpretation of the tale of the four sages by Ezra of Gerona. According to the Kab- balistic interpretation, what the sages saw in the pardes was a vision of the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of the divine Presence, which is also equated with the divine Glory (kavod). Both Ben e Azzai and Ben Zoma were overwhelmed by the radiance (ziw) of the Shekhinah, since their modes of vision were inadequate to apprehend it correctly. These modes are explained theosophically, in terms of a unitive experience (devequt): Ben eAzzai (the man of vision in the typology of the theophanic imagination adum- brated above) experienced union with the Shekhinah, but was unable to detach himself from it, and so he died immersed in the divine light. His visionary experience was linked exegetically to the verse, "For no man may see Me and live" (Ex. 33:20). As for Ben Zoma (the man of intellect in the typology), he was unable to detach himself entirely from the material world, and the experience caused him to lose his mind. For the text of this commentary, see Moshe Idei, "Perush eal ha-knisah le-pardes be-re'shit ha-qabbalah" [A Commentary on the Entry into Pardes in Early Kabbalah], Mahanaim 6 (1993): 34; for the same passage interpreted in sexual terms in the case of Ben eAzzai, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 362-63.</page><page sequence="38">40 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 Only the sage endowed with both intellect and vision (the equivalent of the dhü aWaql wa al-eayn), represented in the tale by R. cAqiva, is capable of simultaneously envisioning the Divine in its multiple theo- phanies and the multiplicity of theophanies in the divine Unicity that is being theophanized. His is the perfect theophanic imagination, which apprehends, in Corbin's formulation, "la comprésence du Dieu-Un et des Figures divines multiples."149 R. eAqiva is to be identified with the sage (hakham) who is exempted from the Talmudic restrictions on exposition of the doctrine of maaseh merkavah, for he is "capable of comprehend- ing on his own."150 R. cAqiva was thus able to "enter and exit" in peace, for he envisioned correctly, seeing simultaneously the One in multiplicity and multiplicity in the One, the two mirrors of the Divine and its theo- phanies reflected in each other.151 The proof-text cited in his connection, "Take me away with you, let us make haste!" (Songs 1:4), is followed by the phrase, "The king has brought me into his chambers," which con- 149 See Corbin, Le paradoxe, 13. 150 For the phrase, see p. 6 above. It may be noted that eAqiva's companions are sometimes depicted in the rabbinic literature not as sages, but merely as students of sages - see Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part I), 195; also Morray- Jones, Trans- parent Illusion, 2. This strikes me as avoiding the main issue raised by the tale, which is comprehension of the theologumenon of ma'aseh merkavah at the highest levels of rabbinic learning - see p. 44 below for the interpretation of Elisha"s mode of vision. 151 In Haydar Ãmolfs formulation: "The man of intellect and vision sees the Di- vine in Creation and Creation in the Divine. He is not veiled from either one by the other. Rather, he sees the One Existent in itself: the Divine from one side (or: face of a mirror), and Creation from the other side (or: face of a mirror). He is not veiled by multiplicity from witnessing [the mirror of] the Face of the Unique One; and in his witnessing, the multiplicity of theophanic manifestations does not compete with the Unicity of the divine Essence that is being theophanized. [At the same time] he is not veiled by the Unicity of [the mirror of] the Face of God from witnessing the multi- plicity represented by Creation; in his witnessing, the multiplicity [of Creation] does not compete with the Unicity of the divine Essence that is theophanically manifested in it." - Haydar Amolï, Nass al-nusüs, 360 §790. This is Ibn 'Arabfs "seeing with both eyes," that is, with rational understanding and imaginai unveiling - see William C. Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge: Ibn al- Arabi' s Metaphysics of Imagination (Al- bany: State University of New York Press, 1989), 225 ff. In Qushayrfs terminology, this epistemic mode, which he says is characteristic of "those who possess intuitive knowl- edge" {ashãb al-ma'arij), is referred to as haqq al-yaqïn - see Grämlich, Das Send- schreiben al-Qusayrîs, 142 §22.2. This same idea was expressed in a very similar fashion by the Kabbalist, Abraham Herrera (ca. 1620), with regard to the Sefirotic emanations (cited in Scholem, Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 40-41): "The Sefiroth are emana- tions from the primal simple unity . . . mirrors of His truth, which share in His nature and essence .... The supreme unities, to whom all the initial multiplicities return, by its intermediacy, to the simple unity; and above all the simple unities is the Infinite, blessed be He."</page><page sequence="39">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 41 firms the acceptability of his mode of imaginai envisioning of the divine Chariot-throne.152 As for Elishae ben Abuyah, also known as Aher ("the Other"), he possessed neither intellect nor vision.153 Not only did he fail to grasp the paradox through any of the visionary modes, but he mistook the theophanic manifestation and the Divine that was being theophanized as representing two separate entities. For this reason he was described as "cutting the shoots" {qitsets bi-netiof), an expression that became the standard rabbinic euphemism for heresy.154 His transgression, which is explained in the Talmudic accounts as well as in the Hekhalot narratives, was to raise the question of the existence of "two powers" (shtei re- shuyyot) when he encountered the angel Metatron before the curtain which veils the divine Chariot-throne in the seventh palace.155 Since 152 For the use of an entire verse in rabbinical exegesis even when only a portion is cited, see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 320 n. 4. In a Talmudic elaboration of the tale, God is reported as stating to the ministering angels who had attempted to keep R. 'Aqiva away from the divine Throne, "Let this elder be, for he is deemed [worthy] of availing himself of My Glory (kavodi)." - B Talmud, Hagigah, 15b; for a discussion of the passage, see Ithamar Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysti- cism (Leiden-Cologne: E. J. Brill, 1980), 147; also Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amne- siac, 160. The medieval interpreters also confirmed the correctness of R. eAqiva's mode of vision: "R. Akiva was more excellent than others, for he peered properly and beheld fitly, and his mind encompassed the frightening visions, and God granted him life .... Everything he saw he interpreted correctly with honest wisdom." - see Elior, "The Concept of God," 1 1 3 (italics in the original; citing 'Otsar ha-geonim). In rabbinic tradition, R. eAqiva was linked exegetically and theologically with the Song of Songs, which he reputedly characterized as the "Holy of Holies" of all scriptural writings, thus commensurate with the entire Torah. His allegorical interpretation of the erotic ima- gery of Songs as representing the love between God and Israel - hence, the king men- tioned in it as God rather than Solomon - was key to the acceptance of the book into the Biblical canon. On this point see Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 32-34. 153 For the sobriquet, Aher, see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 62-69, who explains it in the context of a typological listing where it originally meant ehad ("one"), which strikes me as the most reasonable explanation given to date. It may be noted that, in his own original interpretation of the tale of the four sages, Maimonides switched the proof-texts that applied to Ben Zoma and Elishae ben Abuyah - on this point see Diamond, "Failed Theodicy," 361 and n. 39. 154 The locution is widely attested in rabbinic literature - see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 82-93. It is an interesting point of comparison that, unlike the rabbinic tradition which "invented" the figure of Elisha' thereby admitting the possi- bility of heretical thinking, the Islamic theosophical tradition did not reserve a separate category for heresy in its visionary typology. 155 Viewed within the Achaemenid context of the pardes metaphor, the functions of the angel Metatron would appear to correspond to those of the royal chamberlain, the most important official of the court, who usually sat before the curtain that veiled the royal throne and vetted those who entered into the king's presence - see Widengren, Muhammad, the Apostle of God, 213 and n. 4; also Shaked, "Two Judaeo-Iranian Con- tributions," 294-96.</page><page sequence="40">42 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 1 1 Metatron was seated on a throne and occupied in the lofty task of not- ing down the merits of Israel, Elishae mistook the theophanic manifesta- tion he represented for a divine being possessing an authority equal to God's.156 The proof-text cited as commentary on Elishae's fate, "Let not your mouth lead your flesh into sin," appropriately concludes with an allusion to the angel - "and do not protest before the angel that, 'It was a mistake'" (Eccl. 5:5).157 Many suggestions have been proffered to explain the bizarre locution, qitsets bi-netïot ("to cut the shoots"), which was applied in the tale to characterize Elishae's heretical behavior.158 The meaning of the expres- sion, which can fruitfully be explained only with reference to the pardes metaphor, is disarmingly simple: it is an allusion to the prohibition against the cutting down of trees in the royal palace garden.159 As in- dicated earlier, the planting of fruit trees was of special concern to the Persian kings, since arboriculture constituted an important element in imperial Achaemenid conceptions of kingship, and the destruction of trees, particularly saplings, in the royal garden-palace was interpreted as an affront to the sovereignty of the great king.160 Hence, the expres- 156 According to the account, in order to prevent future such errors, God sent the angel Anafiel to punish Metatron with sixty lashes of fire, "so that everyone will know who is the master and who is the slave." Metatron was then made to stand upright like the rest of the angels who, according to Jewish legendary belief, are unable to sit because they have no joints. 157 For the episode, see B Talmud, ifagigah, 15a; also Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekha- lot-Literatur, §345/§672; and Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 3: 15 (§345) and 4: 74 (§672). For interpretations of the episode, see Wolfson, "Yeridah la-Merka- vah," 25-26; Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 90 ff.; and Nathaniel Deutsch, Guardians of the Gate: Angelic Vice Regency in Late Antiquity (Leiden: Brill, 1999), 48 ff. For an overview of the many scholarly discussions, see Abrams, "Boundaries of Divine Ontology," 294 ff. For the use of an entire verse in rabbinical exegesis even when only a portion is cited, see n. 152 above. 158 Most explanations suggest his transgressions were of the commandments of the Torah. One of the rabbinic explanations is that whoever studies the Torah and is cog- nizant of its commandments, yet does not fulfill them, will be punished more severely than one who has not studied it at all. It is because Elisha* wilfully transgressed against the Torah that he became the prototype of the heretic. His transgression was also interpreted as leading astray, and even killing young Torah students, who were suppo- sedly represented by the saplings - see Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Litera- ture," 242; see also Kuyt, 'Descent' to the Chariot, 220-21. It does not appear to have anything to do with persecution, as suggested by James R. Davila, "The Hodayot Hymnist and the Four who Entered Paradise," Revue de Qumran 17 (1996): 473. 159 It may be noted that Scholem, who expressed scepticism about the meaning of the expression ("whatever this metaphor may signify"), also suggested that it may have been used in the literal sense - see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 16 n. 6, and Addenda, 127. Schäfer also stated that some sources interpret it in this concrete sense of destroy- ing vegetation - see Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 3: 10 n. 7. 160 See p. 17 above.</page><page sequence="41">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Pardes 43 sion qitsets bi-netiot might more meaningfully be rendered as "to cut down saplings."161 Elishae's questioning the nature of the theophanic manifestation of the divine Chariot-throne was thus compared by the rabbinic authors of the tale to the highly disrespectful action of cutting down saplings in a king's garden, since it represented precisely the lack of "respect for the Glory (kavod) of the Creator" they had cautioned against in their restrictions on exposition of the doctrine of maaseh merkavah.162 By the same token, the Talmudic warning not to speculate about "what is above, what is below, what is in front, and what is be- hind," would appear to refer to the ascription of temporal limits or spatial boundaries to God's Essence, and it is highly reminiscent of the formulations of the Muslim theosophers who stated that such deli- miting expressions as "before" and "after," "behind" and "in front," "under" and "above," could not be applied to the concept of God's unicity (tawhfd).163 Although Elishae was, like his companions, a rabbinic sage, well versed in Torah and with respected students of his own, rabbinic tradi- tion constructed a stereotypical image of him as an arch-heretic, and the locution "to cut down the saplings," which has its roots in our tale, remained a euphemism for heresy throughout the medieval period.164 161 Echoes of the cutting down of trees in the royal Persian pardes are found in a tale in the Midrash which tells of a king who leased part of his garden to two tenants, one of whom planted saplings and then cut them down, while the other neither planted saplings nor cut them down. The rabbis posed the question, "With whom is the king angry?" the answer to which was, "Surely with the one who planted saplings and cut them down." - see Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, VII. 4. Significantly, the Hebrew terms used in the text are the same as those in the euphemistic locution, qitsets bi- netiot, "to cut down saplings," which I read without the definite article. The verb qitsets (in the pi'el form) is frequently attested in rabbinic sources with the meaning "to fell trees" - see Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (New York: Judaica Press, 1971; repr. ed., 1996), 1406 and esp. 1407; netiot denotes young trees or saplings - see Jastrow, Dic- tionary of the Targumim, 899. 162 See a 7 above. 163 Thus, for example, al-Hallãj (d. 922), whose eloquent excursus may be inter- preted as an expansion of the more succint rabbinic formulation: "'Before' does not outstrip Him, 'after' does not interrupt Him, 'of does not vie with Him for precedence, 'from' does not accord with Him, 'to' does not join with Him, 'in' does not inhabit Him, 'when' does not stop Him, 'if does not consult with Him, 'above' does not over- shadow Him, 'under' does not support Him, 'opposite' does not face Him, 'with' does not press Him, 'behind' does not take hold of Him, 'in front of does not limit Him, 'previous' does not display Him, 'after' does not cause Him to pass away, etc." - cited in al-Kalâbadhï, al-Taearruf li-madhhab ahi al-tasawwuf ed.

Subtelny JSQ 11 Notwithstanding the efforts by modern scholarship to paint a more sym- pathetic portrait of Elishae and thereby "rehabilitate" him, perhaps to suit the sensibilities of postmodern Jewish thinking, the seriousness of his transgression is not only borne out by the rabbinic elaboration of his image as an unrepentent sinner and apostate whose "merits" were erased by divine decree, but it is also supported by the logic of the typological framework of the tale, which demands an extreme position to counter R. eAqiva's.165 Elisha"s role in the tale is therefore a cautionary one, pointing to the fact that even profound knowledge of the Torah does not by itself guarantee an understanding of its esoteric teachings {torat ha-sod).166 The views on heresy in ancient Iranian religions might serve to illu- minate further the nature of Elishac's transgression. The Iranian sages were particularly sensitive to the possibility that the Zoroastrian Scrip- ture, the Avesta, and its commentary, the Zand, might be interpreted in ways that did not conform to the received orthodox understanding. They too restricted access to key esoteric doctrines that were regarded as religious mysteries (designated by the term rãz), and they warned of the danger of the heretic who threatened religion not from without, but from within by misinterpreting them.167 Describing religion as consisting of seven walls, they observed that the heretic is the only one who, "wear- ing the garment of a carrier of the sacred word," is capable of penetrat- ing from the outermost wall right up to the very essence of religion.168 rabbis, see Rowland, Open Heaven, 314; also Morray- Jones, "Paradise Revisited" (Part I), 195. 165 On the elaboration of Elisha"s image as a sinner, see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, esp. 226. It is hardly possible to agree with Jeffrey Rubenstein's opinion that Elishae's transgression was merely a "peccadillo, saying the wrong thing at the wrong place at the wrong time" - see Rubenstein, "Elisha ben Abuya," esp. 159, 186 and 190-91; and Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 71; or with Goshen- Gottstein who states that Elishae's error was only "fleeting" and "inadvertent" - see Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 91, 106 and 204. For the episode connected with the striking out of Elisha"s merits, see below. 166 It seems to me that to interpret the role of Elisha' in the tale simply in terms of the relationship of Torah to sin, as many scholars have done, does not address the crux of the problem - see for example, Rubenstein, "Elisha ben Abuya," 139-225; also Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, esp. 8 Iff I do, however, agree with Goshen-Gottstein's statement that Elishae's transgression "must make sense in relation to the Torah" - see his conclusions in Sinner and Amnesiac, 197. 167 On this point see James R. Russell, "On Mysticism and Esotericism among the Zoroastrians," Iranian Studies 26 (1993): esp. 73 n. 1 and 87.

Most scholars have interpreted the Metatron incident in the tale as referring to some form of gnostic dualism, in which the concept of the "two powers" was based on two opposing deities, and they have sought to identify Metatron with the gnostic demiurge or demiurgical angel.169 This does not appear to be the case, however, as it was not the angelic manifestation per se, but rather Elishae's misinterpretation of it that constituted the heresy. The entire incident should thus be understood as an illustration of the problem of angelophany, which bears directly on the esoteric doctrine of maeaseh merkavah. The angel Metatron figures prominently in the Hekhalot narratives where he functions not only as the head of the angels and as God's vicegerent, but also as the mediator and messenger between the divine and human realms.170 As the symbolic representative of the divine Pre- sence, Metatron is not a separate ontic entity, and the scriptural verse which is often applied to him in the Hekhalot texts, "My Name is in him" (Ex. 23:21), points to his angelophanic function, for the angel who is invested by God with the divine Name is not ontically distinct from God's formless and invisible Essence.171 Moreover, his multiple names, 169 See Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 9ff.; Scholem, Major Trends, 65; and more recently, Goshen-Gottstein, Sinner and Amnesiac, 103-11; also Deutsch, Guardians of the Gate, 44.

Subtelny JSQ 11 including "chief/prince of the Presence" (sar ha-panim), "chief of the Torah" (sar ha-torah), "lesser God" (yah qatan), and especially "the lesser Tetragrammaton" (YHWH ha-qatan), all point to the same med- iating, theophanic function.172 Corbin articulated this idea on innumer- able occasions, as it was a basic theme in his oeuvre, but perhaps no- where more succinctly than in the following passage in which he summed up his all too brief observations about the problem of angelol- ogy in the Jewish tradition:173 The investiture of the divine Name in the person of the angel best ex- presses the secret of the necessity for his mediation, which results in the fact that every theophany is essentially an angelophany.174 Corroborating such an interpretation was the blurring of boundaries which occurred in the pre-Kabbalistic esoteric tradition between Meta- tron and the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of the divine Presence, which resulted in an anthropomorphic depiction of the divine Presence in angelic form.175 The Talmudic accounts that follow up on the Metatron incident extol R. cAqiva for not mistaking, as Elishae did, God's theophanic manifesta- tions for His Essence, and they cite a number of scriptural proof-texts, including the verses, "But the Lord was not in the wind, etc." (1 Kings 19:11-12), to illustrate the acceptability of his mode of envisioning the Invisible.176 R. eAqiva's ability to grasp the meaning of the Chariot- throne vision was the result of an inner vision or intuitive perception, which the medieval commentators, both rabbinic and Kabbalistic, re- ferred to as a "vision of the heart" (reHyat ha-lev) or an "understanding of the heart" Çovanta de-libbá)}11 Thus, in his interpretation of the tale, Through a Speculum, 90.

In another variant of the Elisha£ episode in the He- khalot narratives, God rebukes Elisha* for "imagining" or "trying to form a conception of My [divine] attributes" - see Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §597. My understanding of the key phrase, "le-harher 'al/ahar middotai" differs markedly from such renderings as "to ponder My secrets" - see Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot- Literatur, 3: 339 (§597), or "to find fault with My attributes" - see Deutsch, Guardians of the Gate, 57. 177 For the notion of the "understanding of the heart" in the rabbinic and Jewish mystical traditions, see Wewers, Geheimnis und Geheimhaltung, 141; Idei, Kabbalah,</page><page sequence="45">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 47 the early eleventh-century commentator and follower of Hai Gaon, Ha- nanel ben Hushi'el, stated that: They did not ascend to the heavens, but rather they [imaginally] envi- sioned (tsofim) [the divine Chariot-throne] and saw [it] by means of an un- derstanding of the heart (be-'ovanta de-libba), like a person who gazes into a mirror that does not shine.178 This intuitive understanding was tantamount to a revelation that was intextricably linked to the experience of an inspired interpretation of Scripture by the contemplative exegete.179 In the Muslim theosophical view, this kind of "imaginai unveiling," which represented the only true way to knowledge of God's Unicity, could not be obtained through a process of ratiocination; rather, it was a gnosis that came to one through spiritual practice and as a result of divine self-disclosure.180 Later med- ieval perceptions of R. eAqiva as having approached the level of pro- phesy in his mode of envisioning the theophanic manifestation of the Chariot-thone were a logical consequence of this notion of the creative convergence of scriptural interpretation and personal revelation.181 88 ff.; and Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 1 1 1-12 and 145-47. On the identical concept and formulation in medieval Muslim mystical sources, see Corbin, L 'imagination créa- trice, 167 ff. Both the Jewish and Muslim theosophists frequently employed the trope of "the eye of the heart" (Heb. 'ein ha-lev; Ar. cayn al-qalb; Per. chashm-i dit) for this intuitive or inner perception, which they identified with the cognitive imagination - see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 171; also Subtelny, Le monde est un jardin, 137-44. 178 'O tsar ha-geonim, 4 (Tractate Hagigah, Commentaries): 61 (the translation is mine). Note the use of the technical term, tsafah, for envisioning the merkavah - for which see n. 137 above. For a discussion of this passage, see Wolfson, Through a Spec- ulum, 147-48. The image is that of a brass or metal mirror which had to be burnished before it could reflect an image clearly - see also p. 53 below. According to rabbinic tradition, of all the prophets only Moses was vouchsafed a clear vision of God's splen- dour, seeing it as a reflection in a shining mirror, whereas the others saw it only as in a mirror that does not shine. 179 On this point, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 120-24, esp. 123: "The vision- ary is, first and foremost, an exegete, whose visions are primarily, not secondarily, informed by visionary accounts in canonical texts." 180 por tne concept of intuitive or imaginai "unveiling" (kashf), see Chittick, Sufi Path of Knowledge, 168. According to Ibn 'Arabï, this kind of knowledge is "an incon- trovertible knowledge which is actualized through unveiling/revelation and which man finds in himself. He receives no obfuscations along with it and is not able to repel it. He knows no proof for it by which it is supported except what he finds in himself." - cited in Chittick, Sufi Path of Knowledge, 169. 181 On this point see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 172.</page><page sequence="46">48 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 An Extreme Expression of the Theophanic Imagination Further insights into the concept of the theophanic imagination may be gleaned from a remarkable genre of early Jewish esoteric literature re- ferred to as Shi'ur qomah ("Measurement of the divine Body"). In con- trast to the muted anthropomorphism expressed in the tale of the four sages and in the Hekhalot narratives in general, these writings, which assigned mythic proportions to each of God's limbs (provided, inciden- tally, in Persian parsangs), represented a blatantly anthropomorphic por- trayal of the vision of the divine Glory enthroned.182 This literature was not, as some have argued, simply a polemic against anthropomorphic representation of the divine Form. Rather, it militated against the very possibility of conceiving of the divine Form which remained, paradoxi- cally, without measurement, since it was said to "fill the entire world."183 The Shïur qomah portrayal, which could only have been inspired by a monotheistic frame of reference, represents yet another instance of the imaginai encounter with the concept of divine theophany, and it may be viewed as an extreme expression of the Jewish theophanic imagina- tion.184 As such, it refers to the theologumenon represented by the rab- binic expression ma'aseh merkavah, and rather than taking us further afield from our stated topic, this seemingly tangential discussion leads us back to its very heart. 182 For an overview of opinions on this literature, see Martin Samuel Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah: Liturgy and Theurgy in Pre-Kabbalistic Jewish Mysticism (Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1983), 13 ff.; on its relationship to Hekhalot literature, see Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 96-90. 183 An allusion to Is. 6:1 ("The whole earth is filled with His Glory [kavodo]"). For the paradoxical nature of the Shi'ur qomah portrayal, see Wolfson, Through a Specu- lum, 90 ff.; also Scholem, Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 25.

Howard Eilberg-Schwartz (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), 142 ff. The mythical conception of the divine Body may have been inspired by Assyrian and Achaemenid imperial iconographie traditions in which the king was usually depicted in superhuman proportions - see Irene J. Winter, "Art in Empire: The Royal Image and the Visual Dimensions of Assyrian Ideology," in Assyria 1995, ed. S. Parpóla and R. M.

The first three, Ben cAzzai, Ben Zoma and Elishae ben Abuyah, represented those topics on which the rabbinic restrictions had been imposed, namely, incestuous sexual relations Çarayot), the ac- count of Creation (ma'aseh bere'shit), and the account of the Chariot- throne (jnaaseh merkavah), respectively. As for R. eAqiva, he represented the correct understanding of the esoteric doctrine of shiur qomah.1*5 While it is difficult to discern any allusions in the narrative to the first two topics, Idel's identification of R. eAqiva with shiur qomah serves to support my interpretation of the tale as an illustration of the esoteric doctrine of ma'aseh merkavah. As I have attempted to demonstrate, the paradoxical nature of the anthropomorphic portrayal of the divine Form in the Shïur qomah literature relates it directly to the theologume- non alluded to by the rabbinic expression, ma'aseh merkavah. Both are concerned with the concept of divine theophany and its relationship to God's formless Essence. Shiur qomah is therefore not to be understood as a separate theological doctrine, but rather as an extreme interpreta- tion of the esoteric doctrine of maaseh merkavah, which found expres- sion in independent literary form. The richly elaborated images of the angel Metatron in early or pre- Kabbalistic literature, which depict him in terms of the same monumen- tal proportions ascribed to the divine Body in the Shiur qomah litera- ture, while at the same time identifying him with the Shekhinah, provide further evidence of the theophanic function of these anthropomorphic and angelomorphic figurations of the divine Presence.186 Not surpris- ingly, the highly sensitive nature of the theological dilemma presented by the Shiur qomah writings, and the potential danger of misinterpreta- tion they posed, often led the medieval transmitters of the tradition to alter the manuscript witnesses in subtle ways in order to portray the paradoxical concept of the embodied vision of the transcendent God of Judaism in an ideologically more palatable fashion.187 185 See Idei, Absorbing Perfections, 219. In his interpretation, Idei stresses the "ex- periential" dimension of the tale over the visionary, and even suggests that these ex- periences were "paranormal" in nature. 186 The identification of Metatron with the shiur qomah on the one hand, and with the Shekhinah on the other is often buttressed by abstruse numerical equivalencies - see Wolfson, "Metatron and Shi'ur Qomah," 64 ft and esp. 81 (where he sums up the paradoxical attitude of the Pietists to the problem of anthropomorphism). 187 These have been ably documented in Abrams, "Dimensions of the Creator," 35- 53 (although I am arguing here against his conclusions on p. 50); see also Abrams, "Boundaries of Divine Ontology," 320, for the dangers inherent in the transmission of the doctrine.</page><page sequence="48">50 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 The Water Illusion: A Virtual Image Do not say water when you reach the stones of pure marble. As if there were syllables for the sound of light. Shirley Kaufman, Four Entered the Pardesm A brief narrative episode, often referred to as the "water illusion," which occurs in the expanded version of the tale in the Babylonian Talmud, serves to reinforce our understanding of the pardes metaphor, and further supports the foregoing interpretation of the tale.189 In this epi- sode, R. eAqiva, the sage endowed with the perfect theophanic imagina- tion, warns his companions after they have entered the royal pardes: "When you reach the pure marble stones Çavnei shayish tahor), do not say, 'Water! Water!' for Scripture says, The one who speaks lies shall not endure before my eyes' (Ps. 101 :7)."190 This same episode occurs in the versions of the tale in the Hekhalot literature, particularly in the Lesser Hekhalot (Hekhalot Zutrat i) where it appears in its fullest form and in fact constitutes the nucleus of the narrative.191 In the latter version, the episode occurs in the description of the sixth palace, where the sages face the crucial test of their worthiness to proceed to the seventh palace, in which the divine Chariot-throne is located:192 And these are they who entered into the pardes: Ben eAzzai, Ben Zoma, Aher (i. e., Elishae ben Abuyah), and R. eAqiva. Ben eAzzai peered at the sixth palace, and saw the radiant aura (ziw hwir) of the marble stones ('avnei shayish) with which it was paved, and his body did not endure it. He opened his mouth, and asked them, "This water, what is its nature?" And he died. About him Scripture says, "Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Ps. 116:15). Ben Zoma peered at the radiance (ziw) of the marble stones, and he imagined that it was water. His body endured it, so that he did not ask 188 Shirley Kaufman, Rivers of Salt (Port Townsend: Copper Canyon Press, 1993), 7. 189 These belong to the grounds of the pardes metaphor, that is, those aspects of the metaphorical vehicle that apply to the tenor, the royal pardes of God the king, includ- ing the encounter with the angel Metatron; the testing by the angelic guards at the gates to the palaces or palace chambers; and the function of the royal curtain (pargod) before the throne. As will be demonstrated, the water episode cannot be considered to be "outside the context of the pardes story," as maintained by Morray- Jones, Transpar- ent Illusion, 16, since it belongs to the grounds of the pardes metaphor. 190 B Talmud, Hagigah, 14b. 191 On this point see Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot- Literatur, 3: 9 n. 1; also Dan, Ancient Jewish Mysticism, 140; and Morray- Jones, Transparent Illusion, 86. 192 For the significance of the sixth palace or gate, see Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 147.</page><page sequence="49">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 51 them, but his mind did not endure it, and he became afflicted (i. e., he lost his mind). About him Scripture says, "If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you be surfeited with it and vomit" (Prov. 25:16). Elishae ben Abuyah descended (in other versions: peered) and cut down the saplings.193 How did he cut down the saplings? They said that at the moment when he came into synagogues and houses of study, and he saw there children being successful with the Torah, he would say [something] about them, and they would be silenced. About him Scripture says, "Let not your mouth lead your flesh into sin" (Eccl. 5:5). R. eAqiva entered and exited (in other versions: ascended and descended) in peace. About him Scripture says, "Take me away with you, let us make haste! The king has brought me into his chambers" (Songs 1:4).194 At the entrance to the sixth palace, the sages are confronted with the sight of the highly polished marble tiles with which the floor of the royal palace was paved, which were so reflective that they created the illusion of water.195 Both marble and water belong to the grounds of the par des metaphor. Achaemenid palaces were tiled with marble or limestone, and the same term, shayish (= shesh), occurs in the description of the marble floor of the throne room of the Achaemenid palace in the Book of Esther (1:6).196 Water was an essential element of the Near Eastern ar- chitectural garden, and besides irrigation canals, a reservoir or reflecting pool, which also had a decorative function, was invariably located in front of a pavilion or other structure that gave out onto the garden.197 The area around the pool was tiled, and the tiling usually extended all the way to the pavilion, thereby linking the two. While the precise nature of these architectural details remains conjectural, the confusion between marble and water, which derives from the reflective qualities of both, 193 It is noteworthy that some of the Hekhalot versions of the tale preserve this technical usage of yarad in connection with merkavah speculation - see Schäfer, Syn- opse zur Hekhalot- Literatur, §345; and Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 3: 14 (§345); for discussion of the term, see p. 32. This does not contradict Schäfer's observation that the verb yarad does not appear together with the term pardes in Hekhalot literature, since it is used here in its purely technical sense, and not with reference to the pardes - see Schäfer, "New Testament and Hekhalot Literature," 241. 194 Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §345/§672; and Schäfer, Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur, 3: 11-14 (§345/§672). 195 It may be noted that the same term, ziw, was used in the anonymous thirteenth- century Kabbalistic commentary on the tale to refer to the radiance of the Shekhinah, which was compared to the blinding light of the sun - see n. 148 above. 196 The expression, 'avnei shayish (marble stones/tiles), also occurs in 1 Chron. 29:2, with reference to the building materials of the temple, as noted by Morray- Jones, Transparent Illusion, 89. For the use of stone in Achaemenid palaces, see Stronach, "From Cyrus to Darius," 98. 197 See p. 19 above.</page><page sequence="50">52 Maria E. Subtelny JSQ 11 refers to an important visual effect that was exploited, often with stun- ning results, in Persian landscape architecture.198 The water illusion in the sixth palace is an anticipatory image which heralds the theophanic manifestation of the Chariot-throne in the se- venth. If we relate it to the various modes of vision discussed in the interpretation of the tale, it represents only a virtual image that is re- flected in the theophanic mirror of the Divine.199 To question the "nat- ure" of this image as if it were a veridical one, is thus to see only the theophanic form reflected in the mirror of the Divine (as Ben Zoma did), or conversely, only the Divine reflected in the mirror of theophany (as Ben e Azzai did). Both of these visionary modes were inadequate and illusory, and corresponded to the "lies" referred to in the Scriptural proof-text cited in the abovementioned version of the tale in the Baby- lonian Talmud.200 Further support for this understanding may be adduced from a ver- sion of the water episode in the Hekhalot narratives in which it is stated that anyone who questions the "nature" of the water illusion is to be compared to a worshipper of the Biblical golden calf, that is, to an idolator.201 This charge is highly reminiscent of the "metaphysical ido- latry" of Corbin's formulation, since to reify God's ineffable Essence by apprehending the virtual image of the theophanic manifestation as if it were the divine Reality that is being theophanized, is tantamount to worshipping an idol in place of God Himself.202 Similar polemical state- ments were frequently made by the medieval Muslim theosophists. Al- luding to the prophetic Tradition, "You shall see your Lord just as you 198 See Mehdi Khansari et al., The Persian Garden: Echoes of Paradise (Washington, D. C: Mage Publishers, 1998), 97 and 162 (for the example of the Chihil Sutun palace pavilion in Isfahan, where the twenty columns of the pavilion are reflected in the pool in front of it, thereby creating the illusion of forty columns). In his analysis of the episode, Morray- Jones argues that the water illusion represents the transparent pave- ment of the celestial temple - see Morray- Jones, Transparent Illusion, esp. 92 and 96. It is for this reason that had to consider the episode as being "outside the context of the pardes story," since his interpretation makes no sense with regard to the pardes meta- phor - see n. 189 above. 199 To cite Corbin's formulation of the problem: "Si les formes apparaissent dans les miroirs, elles ne sont pourtant pas dans les miroirs." - Corbin, L'imagination créatrice, 168 (italics in the original). 200 See n. 190 above. 201 See Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekahlot-Literatur, §408; Schäfer, Übersetzung der He- khalot- Literatur, 3: 147-48 (§408).

His theophanic manifestation), When the matter is misapprehended, that praise becomes idolatry.203 The meaning of the water illusion was rendered transparent by the more perceptive among the medieval Jewish commentators on the tale.204 Drawing on the versions of the tale both in the Talmudic accounts and in the Hekhalot narratives, Hananel b. Hushi'el explained that the water illusion represents only a virtual image that is reflected in this world (demut ba-eolam)9 and not a veridical reality.205 This virtual image belongs to the eolam ha-demut, the imaginai world, hence it is a purely mental image produced by the cognitive imagination, which the medie- val theosophists, Jewish and Muslim alike, identified with the heart.206 Thus, the thirteenth-century Judaeo- Arabic author, eObadyah ben Abra- ham Maimonides, who compared the sediment at the bottom of a re- flecting pool in a garden to the residue of carnal desire in the mystic's heart, which prevented it from reflecting the supernal Tablet, stated that it was the residual impurity on the face of the mirror of the creative imagination that caused the sages in the tale not to heed R. eAqiva's warning and to mistake the virtual image they saw for a veridical one.207 As the organ of visionary perception, the heart was often com- 203 The Mathnawi of Jalálu'ddín Rumi, ed.

PaRDeS in the Kabbalistic Imagination The tale of the four sages continued to exercise the exegetical imagina- tions of the medieval Jewish Kabbalists, and although it passed through the filter of their particular phenomenology, it retained its essential meaning as an illustration of the esoteric doctrine pertaining to the con- cept of divine theophany. It seems that it was primarily this aspect of the tale, with its allusion to imaginai envisioning of divine theophanic forms, now interpreted in terms of the Sefirotic emanations, that re- tained its relevance for the Kabbalists, although the motif of ascent, heavenly or otherwise, also played an important role.208 Lending support to this contention was the Kabbalistic application of the rabbinic euphemism, "to cut down the saplings" {qitsets bi-netioi), which had been used to characterize Elishac ben Abuyah's faulty mode of vision in the tale, to instances where there was a danger of drawing the same sort of ontological distinctions with regard to the Sefirot as he had made in his encounter with the angel Metatron.209 According to an anonymous thirteenth-century commentator who took as his starting point the interpretation of the tale by Ezra of Gerona (ca. 1230), the expression, "to cut down the saplings," meant that by mistaking "one thing for two" Elishac separated the sapling {neta') of the Sefirotic tree from its root (shoresh), that is, from its divine ontic source, with the result that it withered and died.210 The Kabbalistic commentator con- cluded from this explanation that, by making an ontological distinction ("The Treatise of the Well") distorts the metaphor by rendering incorrectly the term hawd, which in medieval Arabo-Persian garden design denoted a reservoir or reflecting pool, for which see n. 66 above. 208 In his forthcoming article, "On Paradise in Jewish Mysticism," which he gener- ously made available to me, Moshe Idei has developed a typology of the paradise motif in Kabbalistic literature, based on interpretations of the tale of the four sages as para- dise visits. 209 See, for example, Abrams, "Boundaries of Divine Ontology," 310 and 316. 210 The Sefirotic tree is depicted upside-down, with the roots above, in the supernal world, and the branches below, in the phenomenal world - see Schäfer, Mirror of His Beauty, 120.

It is outside the scope of this article to survey the full range of inter- pretations of the tale at the hands of the medieval Jewish Kabbalists, and I will confine myself here to focusing briefly on one aspect of its legacy, namely the ingenious application of the term PaRDeS as an acronym for the fourfold interpretation of Scripture: the literal or con- textual (peshat), the philosophical-allegorical (remez), the homiletical (derashah), and the esoteric or mystical (sod).212 Apparently introduced by the late thirteenth-century Spanish Kabbalist, Moses de León, in a lost work entitled Sefer ha-Pardes (ca. 1290),213 the acronym was in- 211 See Idei, "Perush eal ha-knisah le-pardes," 35 (with a play on the word 'iqqar, meaning "essence" and "root," which relates it to the shoresh or "root" of the Sefirotic tree). The term 'emunah here refers to the inner or mystical truth of religion, which in the Kabbalistic tradition relates specifically to the unity of the Sefirot - see Scholem, Kabbalah, 1. 212 See Gershom Scholem, On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, trans. Ralph Man- heim (New York: Schocken Books, 1996), 57-59. Scholem and others have sought the source of the fourfold model represented by the acronym in Christian scriptural exeg- esis, to which it never really corresponded - see A. van der Heide, "PARDES: Meth- odological Reflections on the Theory of the Four Senses," Journal of Jewish Studies 34.2 (1983): 148-59; and Frank E. Talmage, "Apples of Gold: The Inner Meaning of Sacred Texts in Medieval Judaism," in Frank E. Talmage, Apples of Gold in Settings of Silver: Studies in Medieval Jewish Exegesis and Polemics, ed. Barry Dov Walfish (Tor- onto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1999), 114-16. A more obvious source would appear to be the fourfold method of Qur'anic exegesis in Sufi hermeneutics - see Gerhard Böwering, "The Scriptural 'Senses' in Medieval Süfi Qur'än Exegesis," in With Reverence for the Word: Medieval Scriptural Exegesis in Judaism, Christianity, and Is- lam, ed. Jane Dämmen McAuliffe, Barry D. Walfish, and Joseph W. Goering (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 350-53; see also the comments of Barry Walfish in his introduction to the volume (p. 7). 213 According to Moses de León: "I called [the book] by the name Pardes in virtue of the matter that is known, for I composed it in accordance with the secret of the four ways [of interpretation], according to its very name [as alluded to in the saying] 'Four entered the pardes,' i.e., peshat, remez, derashah, sod - this is the matter of PaRDeS. I explained there these matters pertaining to the secret of the narrative and literal sense written in the Torah, to show that everything is the eternal life and the true Torah, and there is nothing in all the Torah that is not contained in the secret of His name, may He be elevated." - Cited and discussed in Elliot R.

Subtelny JSQ 11 tended not so much to demonstrate the exegetical viability of each of the four modes, conceived hierarchically as progressing from an exoteric to an esoteric understanding, as it was to prove that all modes of scriptural interpretation, including the plain or literal sense, pointed to a "secret" or esoteric meaning, which, according to the hermeneutical formula of the Kabbalists, represented "the way of truth" {derekh ha-'emet).2XA According to some interpretations, the four exegetical modes repre- sented by the acronym were construed as corresponding to the four sages in the tale, with R. eAqiva typologically representing the esoteric, Kabbalistic, mode.215 Reinforcing this identification was the long-stand- ing association of R. eAqiva with the Biblical Song of Songs, which in Kabbalistic hermeneutics epitomized the nexus between eroticism and esotericism.216 R. eAqiva thus came to be regarded as the model Kabb- alist, just as he had been the model of the Merkavah contemplative,217 and the expression, "one who enters and exits," which summed up his correct mode of imaginai envisioning in the tale, came to denote the 214 Moshe Idei has aptly referred to the fourfold method in the Zohar as an "inte- grative exegesis" - see his "The Zohar as Exegesis," in Mysticism and Sacred Scripture, ed. Stephen T. Katz (Oxford-New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), 89; also Idei, "PaRDeS," 249-53; and Idei, Absorbing Perfections, 429-35; on this point see also Wolfson, "Beautiful Maiden Without Eyes," 170-71. For an illustration of the applica- tion of the fourfold scheme in the Zoharic allegory of the beautiful maiden in the palace {Zohar 2: 99a-99b), see Talmage, "Apples of Gold," 111; Idei, "Zohar as Exeg- esis," 91-92; and Wolfson, "Beautiful Maiden Without Eyes," 169-70. The fourfold scheme was not employed to the exclusion of the sevenfold method of interpretation, however, for which see Tishby, Wisdom of the Zohar, 3: 1084 and 1114 n. 47. This too would appear to attest to the influence of esoteric Qur'anic commentary - see Böwer- ing, "The Scriptural 'Senses'," 352; and Moshe Idei, Language, Torah, and Hermeneu- tics in Abraham Abulafia, trans. Menahem Kallus (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), 82-83 and 188 n. 5. 215 See Idei, "PaRDeS," 253-54; Idei, Absorbing Perfections, 433 and 305; and Idei, "Zohar as Exegesis," 90-92. 216 See n. 152 above. The role of Song of Songs in Kabbalistic hermeneutics is dis- cussed by Elliot Wolfson in chapter 8 of his forthcoming book, Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination. I am grateful to the author for shar- ing with me the manuscript of this magisterial work. In the Zoharic exegesis of Songs 1 :4 ("The king has brought me into his chambers") - the scriptural proof-text which was applied to R. 'Aqiva in the tale of the four sages - the "chambers" are interpreted as the Garden of Eden which represents the totality of the Sefirotic emanations, each of which is accorded a separate "chamber" - see Le Zohar: Cantique des Cantiques, trans. Charles Mopsik (Paris: Verdier, 1999), 99 if. Significantly, the relevation of the Song of Songs was attributed in the Zohar to the inspirational figure of the prophet Elijah - the counterpart of Khidr in the Islamic mystical tradition - who plays a prominent role only in this book of the Zoharic corpus - see Cantique des Cantiques, trans. Mopsik, 63 n. 146. 217 See Scholem, Major Trends, 57; and Scholem, Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 21.</page><page sequence="55">(2004) The Tale of the Four Sages who Entered the Fardes 57 Kabbalistic exegete who was able to experience an ecstatic state of illu- mination in the process of textual interpretation, and to emerge from it unscathed.218 The four modes were also compared to the four levels of the cosmos, and in an allusion to the concept of theophany, the esoteric mode was appropriately equated with the world of Emanation ÇAtsilut), the plane on which the Divine manifests itself in its theophanic forms.219 Finally, we may note the Zoharic application of the metaphor "pardes of the Torah" to the Shekhinah, the angelophanic manifestation of the divine Presence, traditionally associated with the Oral Torah, and iden- tified with the last of the ten Sefirotic emanations, since by comprising all levels of scriptural meaning within herself, she was believed to repre- sent the innermost kernel of the nut of meaning in the garden of theo- sophical speculation.220 *** In summation, the ostensible simplicity of the tale of the four sages belies the profundity of this parabolic rabbinic commentary on the eso- teric doctrine of macaseh merkavah, which denoted the theologumenon pertaining to the concept of divine theophany, and the way in which it was to be understood within the framework of Jewish monotheism. It is, in short, a visionary tale concerned with imaginai envisioning of the invisible God of Judaism. The rabbinic sages who entered the metapho- rical pardes of the divine King did so for the purpose of speculating about the nature of the ontological relationship between God's mani- fested forms, as symbolically represented by the divine Chariot-throne, and God's ineffable and transcendent Essence. Their various responses to that vision, presented in the form of a fourfold typology, were com- mensurate with their ability to apprehend the paradoxical concept of divine Self-manifestation by means of what Corbin termed a "theopha- nic imagination." Within the range of typological possibilities, only one of the sages, pseudepigraphically identified with the great Tannaitic scholar-saint, R. eAqiva, was able to envision the correct nature of the 218 "Man de-ealu we nafaq" ("one who enters and exits"), the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew phrase used in the tale of the four sages, occurs in the thirteenth-century Zoharic corpus - see Scholem, Kabbalah, 7; and Elliot R.

R. eAqiva thus emblematized in the Jewish tradition the Torah scholar who comprehends intuitively the mysterium at the heart of monotheistic faith, the contemplative who is capable of imaginally envisioning the divine Chariot-throne, and the inspired Kabbalist who moves freely between the spiritual and phenom- enal worlds.</page></plain_text>
