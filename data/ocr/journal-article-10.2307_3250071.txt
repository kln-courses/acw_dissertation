<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY F. LINDA NARAYANAPURAM: A TENTH CENTURY SITE IN KALINGA Four temples facing east remain standing in differing stages of completion and preservation in the small and remote village of Narayanapuram. These temples are situated near the west bank of the Suvarnamukhi River, about three miles east of Balijipeta on the border of Bobbli and Palakonda taluk (sub-district) in Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh (fig.I &amp; pl. I).I This area was included in the medieval principality of Kalifiga which, from the fifth through tenth centuries, was centered between the Varh-adh-r- and N-gavali Rivers in Srikakulam District, extended north to southern Ganjam District, Orissa, and south to Vizianagaram, in Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh.2 Although Prabhafijanavarman of the Mathara-kula (family), who probably ruled in the sixth century, called himself "Sakalakalifig-dhipati," ruler of all Kalifiga, and stated in one of his grants that Kalifiga extended from the Mahanadi to the Krsna Rivers, Mathara copper-plate grants of land have been found only in the limited area described above.3 The same area, from southern Ganjam District in modern Orissa to Vizianagaram in Vifakhapatnam District in Andhra Pradesh, was ruled and further settled by the Early or Eastern Gafiga dynasty from the seventh century through at least the tenth century.4 Na-rayanapuram seems to have been located on the farthest southwest, or interior, border of this principality. Other temples within the medieval territory of Kalifiga remain at Sdrapalli and Jayati in Visa- khapatnam District, at Mukhalifigam in Srikakulam District, and on Mahendra Mountain in Ganjam District, Orissa. This site is significant for several reasons. First, the temples at Narayanapuram, and the Someivara temple in Mukhalifigam, are the latest extant temples constructed in the early medieval architectural tradition developed in Kalifiga. This tradition began in stone in the mid-seventh century and, although some characteristics were shared with traditions prevalent at the time in the medieval kingdoms of Orissa, it continued with limited influence from those traditions to the north for a period of at least 300oo years. Secondly, except for one image missing on the hall, all images remain on the temple and hall of the largest temple at Narayanapuram, the Nilakantheivara. No other temple in Kalifiga, nor any medieval temple in related traditions to the north in present day Orissa, possesses a sculptural program this complete. The set of nine images which was carved on the Nilakanthesvara temple appears also on the most northern temple at the same site, on the contemporary Somevara temple, on the temple at Sarapalli and on the two extant temples at Jayati.5 Unfortunately, other than foundation stones, the halls of these other ninth and tenth century temples in Kalifiga have completely disappeared, making it impossible at this point to determine if a similar sculptural program was originally present on halls at these sites. The final point of importance is that even though there are only four temples at Nnrnyan.apuram, three temple types are represented (pl. J). The south temple (deul) has a curvilinear tower (gandi) of straight horizontal courses (pidha) uninterrupted except by the central projection (raha); the large Nilakantheivara 1 I am deeply grateful to Mr. N. Mukunda Rao, Assistant Director, Epigraphy, of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Hyderabad for mentioning this site to me. As far as I know, the temples are not published anywhere. 2 The history of the area called Kalifiga from the time of Adoka (3rd century B. C.) through the thirteenth century is summarized in Chapter I of Mary E Linda, "Medieval Hindu Kalifiga Temples," (PhD dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, 1986). The "real" limits, vs. claimed extent, of territory controlled by the kings of Kalifiga of the Mathara and Early Gafiga dynasties from the fifth through tenth centuries is determined by the find-spots of their copper-plate grants. See also pp. 44- 55, supra. 3 For Prabhaiijanavarman's grant, see S.N. Rajaguru, Inscriptions of Orissa, vol. i, pt. ii (Bhubanesvar, 1958), p. 44. 4 See footnote 2. 5 On the Dibbesvara deul at Sarapalli, the southeast image is only partially carved and the image in the south niche on the westis blank; the two deul at Jayati definitely have the same images as the Nilakantheivara deul. Five deul with the same sets of images and close in time to each other would strongly suggest that the Dibbeivara deul would have had the same nine images. 232</page><page sequence="2">temple (deul) and the north deul are rekha deul which have curvilinear gandi of five vertical divisions (pafcaratha) separated by slight recesses (anurahd), and horizontal stories (bhumi) marked by amld (dmldkd); and the fourth deul is the valabhi type which has a khakhard or barrel-vaulted roof.6 All four deul enshrine lihga today but probably, as discussed below, the khdkhard deul originally housed a female deity. Kings of the Early Gafiga dynasty ruled Kalifiga during the tenth century when these deul were constructed at N-r-yanapuram, but there is no inscriptional evidence to associate the site with any particular ruler of the dynasty. Fifty-two inscriptions are carved on the east exterior of the Nilakanthesvara hall (jagamohana) and on the interior pillars, but none refers to the founding of the deul. In fact, all the inscriptions post-date construction of the four deul at the site. The earliest is dated Saka IoI7 (A.D. IO95) during the reign of the Later Gafiga Anantavarman Codagafiga and the latest decipherable date is Saka ii73 (A.D. 127I).7 All the inscrip- tions record gifts of cows or land for perpetual lamps (in one instance, for food offering) or direct gifts of lamps to the temple of Nilesvara at Navapalli, frequently for the merit of Codagafigadeva. The donors are non-royal and include both males and females. North Deul The rekha deul on the north is only nine and one-half feet square and, as is the case with the other two deul with square ground plans, the exterior width of this deul is double the width of the garbha grha (fig. 3 &amp; pl. 3). Walls (bd.a-) are divided vertically into three parts (triratha) and the gandi is pancaratha (five vertical divisions). Two of three moldings (pdbhdga), the top patd and the middle round kumbha, which are the same height around the deul, are visible above ground; both are indented below the central (parivadevatd) niches. Broad bands of plain stone surround all niches (mundi) and a small rectangular panel (dvara-laldta-bimba) hangs from the lintel centers. The subsidiary (dvaranadevatd) niches and the two mundi on the east are surmounted by two horizontal courses while the pdarvadevata- niches are topped by only one pidha course. All mundi terminate beneath the one moulding and recess (baranda) which separate the walls (bada) of the deul from the gandi. Amild on the outer (kanika) and upturned lotus petals on the inner (anaratha) vertical divisions of the padncaratha gandi mark the three horizontal stories (bhumi) of three courses each. Blocked out triangular forms unite the upper two courses and the bottom course is carved with a more oval form. Both the lower and upper medallion motifs (vajramastaka) on the central projection (rdhd) of the gandi are each the height of one story. There is a top stone (skandha) on this deul and the remains of a cylindrical wall (beki) and crowning dimld. Pilasters of the eastern doorway begin above the moldings (pdbhdga) and are carved with dvdrapdla and meandering floral scrolls (pl. 2). The architrave is partially broken but five of probably nine planets (nava- graha) remain. A recessed inner band of lotus petals surrounds the doorway and the lintel carved with floral motifs; the pilasters of this inner band are missing. A complete sculptural program ofpdrivadevatd and dvaranadevatd images is in situ: on the east are Gafiga (south) on a makara and Yamuna (north) on her turtle or kurma; on the south from the east, Lakuliha, Ganesa (pl. 4) and Gafig-dhara; on the west from the south, Ardhanri, K-rttikeya (pl. 5) and Hari-Hara, and on the north from the west, Ekapdda, Mahisisuramardini (pl. 6) and standing Siva. The style and iconography of these images are the same as the sculptures on the Nilakantheivara temple which will be discussed below. South Deul The deul on the south is approximately ten feet square and except for the form of the gandi, is architecturally similar to the northern deul (fig. 2 &amp; pl. 7). On this deul however, the bottom khura molding is still visible. 6 Whenever possible, terms from the Bhubanapradipa are used in this article. See Nirmal Kumar Bose, Canons of Orissan Architecture (New Delhi: Cosmo Publications, 1982). The Bhubanapradipa is not firmly dated but clearly contains information pertinent to early temples, as well as temples as late as the thirteenth century. For a discussion of other texts associated with architecture in this area of India, and the problems with them, see Linda, pp. 83-89- 7 The inscriptions at Na-rayanapuram are interspersed in the Eastern Gafiga grants listed in South Indian Inscriptions X, pp. 351-377. The script used in the text is Telegu. 233</page><page sequence="3">The gand i consists of thirteen pidha which rise directly from the walls (bada) of the deul. In contrast to that of the north deul, which is padncaratha, this gandi is only divided vertically by the central projection (rdha) and is therefore triratha. There are no bhumi marked by dmrd. A cylindrical wall (beki), surmounted by a fluted circular stone (dmld), rests on the top pidha. The covering of the drmld is a flattened curved stone (khapuri) which is topped by a lihga-like stone. This type of lihga, open to the sky and known as dkdahlinga, certainly signifies the Saivite dedication of the temple. Stella Kramrisch thinks the form may be a symbolic representa- tion of the central pillar of the temple which separates heaven and earth: a pillar which is a shaft of light sheathed by the gandi.8 It may also symbolize the fifth head of Siva Maheiamfirti.9 Decorative embellishments of this temple remain incomplete. Triangular shapes above a band along the lower edge of each pidha have been blocked out. Two seventh century deul in Kalinga, the Yuddhisthira on Mahendra Mountain and the Bhimesvara in Mukhalifigam, possess similar simple triangular forms as embell- ishment on gandi pidha. It is possible that the earlier tradition was still maintained at this later date, but it is more probable that the triangular forms were intended to be carved into vertical rows of single candrafalal. The central projections (rdhd) of the gandi would have been carved with a vajramastaka consisting of a lower medallion three pidha high and an upper medallion another three courses tall. Each pidha course remains level across the width of the gandi, even through the central projection (rd~hd). Triangular patterns sometimes flanked by small squares, which undoubtedly would have been carved into a candraadld and flanking animal figures, as on other Kalifiga deul, are repeated on the top base molding, on the pi4dha of the mundi and on the molding of the recess (baranda) separating the walls (bda-) and the gandi. Parivadevata have only been partially carved: Ganela on the south, seated Karttikeya on the west (pl. 7) and Mahisdsuramardini on the north; stones on which subsidiary images (dvaranadevatd) would have been carved remain in situ. At the east entrance, outer pilasters begin above the moldings (pdbhdga) and support an architrave under the gandi rdhd (central projection). The pilasters and inner bands of the doorframe remain unfinished. This type of deul with square ground plan, and a curvilinear gand i composed of pidha without imld to distinguish the bhuimi, is not mentioned in the Bhubanapradipa, a filpa idstra which has been found in Puri and Cuttack Districts, Orissa, or in any other text. A similar type called the bhadra deul which has a gand.i of pidha "piled up in the form of a pyramid" is mentioned in the Bhubanapradipa; the pidha decrease in size with each platform "in such a manner that the sides of the pyramid strike the horizontal at an angle of 45 degrees orless."o1 In other words, the pdi4ha gandi would maintain a consistently decreasing width as height increases. Addition- ally, there would be no curve in the profile of the gandi. This describes well the superstructures of halls (jagamohana) attached to the front of some deul from the tenth century onwards in Orissa, such as that of the Mukteivara in Bhubaneivar (pl. 40). In Kalifiga, however, structures with square ground plans and with gandi ofpidha were deul which enshrined images and not jagamohana. The difference between the superstructure of the Mukteivarajagamohana and that of the south deul at Nardyanapuram is the greater height of the latergandi in relation to the width of the deul, and the pronounced curve of the gand i. The importance of this gandi type in Kalinga is indicated by its construction on the Yuddhisthira deul on Mahendra Mountain, on the Bhimeivara and Madhukeqvara deul in Mukhalitigam and at NMiryanapuram. In the Madhukeivara temple complex and at Narayanapuram, this gandi form is constructed alongside rekha deul whose gandi are clearly paiicaratha and horizontally divided by dmli into bhtmi. Valabhi Deul In contrast to the two deul discussed above and the large deul discussed below which all have square ground plans, the fourth deul at Narayanapuram is rectangular in plan and possesses a barrel-vaulted rather than a 8 Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, 2 vols.

The symbolism of this "pillar" also applies to the pot (kalaia) on top of temples. 9 M.A. Dhaky, "The Akasalifiga Finial," Artibus Asiae XXXVI, 4 (1974): PP- 309-3Io0.

In the Bhubanapradipa, this curved roof is termed khAkhard, and deul with this type of roof are classed as Dravira (Drivida) or Barabhi (valabhi).ll In I960, Debala Mitra identified 12 deul of this type and all enshrined forms of Sakti; now, including this deul, the total number of this type is 20.12 Today, the valabhi deul at Narayanapuram enshrines a ilnga, but it appears to have been recently placed there in the dirt floor. It is most likely that a form of Sakti was originally enshrined there in keeping with other valabhi deul. The valabhi deul at Narayanapuram is approximately 18 /2 feet by 13 feet. It is the least finished of the four deul. No images have been carved in the ii niches, but architecturally it is consistent in detail with the north deul and the Nilakanthegvara. The triratha walls (bdda) have three moldings (pdbhdga) indented below niches; niches (mundi) consist of broad pilasters topped by relief gandi of four pidha courses over the side niches (dvaranadevatd) and three over the pdrivadevatd. The south, west and north sides have three niches; the extra length of the western side is utilized by broad pilasters on either side of the pairvadevatd niche. The superstructure begins above the recess (baranda) on top of the walls (bdda) and consists of two stories (bhutmi) of four courses each and a double barrel-vaulted roof. The bhbmi are pancaratha and are marked by dmld in the outer (kanika) and upturned lotus petals on the inner (anaratha) divisions. The upper roof has fallen in but it appears the crowning element was a single large dmld.13 The central divisions (rdhd) project on the east and west as high as the lower vault and on the north and south, terminate below the vault. The lower design of the vajramastaka is one story (bhumi) high and on the east is partially carved with a rectangular panel above the doorway. The upper design would have extended the height of the second bhumi. Parts of the doorframes around the east entrance are damaged but sufficient stone remains to determine that the outer pilasters rise from the moldings (pdbhdga) to an architrave; this frame surrounds a thin recessed band and another broader inner surface. Nilakantheivara Deul The Nilakantheivara deul and hall (jagamohana) stand in relatively good condition with all major architec- tural elements and images intact even though large portions of the deul decorative embellishments are unfinished. The deul is I7 feet square and the jagamohana attached on the east is 29 feet long (fig. 5 &amp; pls. 8 &amp; Io). Nandi, the mount (vdhana) of Siva, faces the garbha grha from the east. Triratha in plan, the walls (bdda) have four moldings (pdbhdga) indented below all niches but the pdarsvadevatd niche pdbhdga are compressed and lower than the side (dvaranadevatd) niche pdbhdga (pl. 9). Niches are surrounded by a broad band and three inner recessed bands, as are the niches on the three other deul; have small pendant panels (dvdra-laldta-bimba) in the center of the second band; and are surmounted by triratha gandi reliefs composed of six pidha and a top stone (skanda). The six pi4dha courses of the mundi are carved with a band on the lower edge and triangular shapes the height of each pi4dha flanked by two small squares, an embellishment on the niche pi4.ha courses of all the temples. One molding and a recess (baranda) separate the walls (bdda) from the parncaratha, seven bhumi gandi (pl. 8). Each bhumi is three horizontal courses and marked by dmla in the outer vertical (kanika) divisions and by lotus petal courses in the inner (anaratha) divisions and on the flange of the central projection (rahd). On the four rahd, a rectangular panel is carved within the lower, one bhumi high oval and the stones of the upper 11 Ibid., pp. 169-70 and 80. 12 Debala Mitra, "Four Little Known Khikhara Temples in Orissa," Journal of the Asiatic Society ii (196o): pp. I-23. The khdkharda temple at Nirayanapuram, the three shrines at the Madhukeivara temple in Mukhalifigam, the three at the Siva temple at Punjiyama, Puri District and the shrine in the south wall of the Patalesvara temple at Paikapada, Koraput District make the total extant number of this type, 20. The shrines at Mukhalifigam, Punjiyama, and Paikapada are subsidiary in a complex of shrines surrounding a central temple which houses the main image and therefore, are functionally different than the kha-kharda temples listed by Mitra. Also, except for the south shrine at Paikapada, the original images in the other subsidiary shrines are unknown today. 13 The three khdkhard shrines at the Madhukesvara temple in Mukhalifigam, also in Kalifiga, are topped by three pots (kalasa). These temples are much smaller in size than the Narayanapuram temple. 235</page><page sequence="5">medallion extend into two more bhumi. This design (vajramastaka) would have been repeated in miniature on the courses within each bhumi of the gandi: the top two courses remain connected by a triangular form and the bottom course is carved with an oval relief. A figure (beki-bhairava) has been placed at the top of each rdhd; the cylindrical wall (beki), dmld, capping stone (khapuri) and kalaia (pot) continue above. A very narrow and short antarala, which extends from the middle of the inner pilasters of the east mundi to the outer pilasters of the garbha grha doorframe, joins the deul and jagamohana (fig. 5). The jagamohana has entrances with elaborately decorated frames on the north and east, a window in the center of the south wall opposite the north entrance, and eight pillars with simple bases and capitals on the interior; two of the pillars are joined to the antarala wall before the garbha grha doorway. On the exterior, the east doorway is flanked by pilasters with three pidhas above and two mundi (pl. i1); the south side has five mundi (pl. io), the north side, four mundi and a doorway, and on the west, one mundi is placed on the hall at either side of the antarala. The jagamohana is roofed by an eave and single clerestory. Narrative reliefs are carved on the edges of both around the jagamohana. The outer pilasters of the entrances on the north and east, and the center niches on the south, project farther than other niches, stressing the importance of those cardinal directions. All niches are pi4dha mundi of the same form: three indented moldings (pdbhdga), a pendant panel (dvdra-lal'ata-bimba) in the center of the second band and pidha courses with triangular reliefs above. The south center mundi has two courses and all others three. The horizontal emphasis created by moldings (pdbhdga) at equal height around the jagamohana and the repetition of the same size mund.i, balanced by the projections and recesses of thepdbhdga, pilasters andpidha courses, give the structure a sculpted effect. There are three doorways on the Nilakantheivara deul. Even though the reliefs were completed, some of the figures are badly broken or abraded and identification is difficult. On the pilasters of the garbha grha doorway, floral scrolls, rising from pots on the top molding, meander up to capitals which support an architrave decorated with diamond-shaped floral patterns (pl. 12). Within this frame, four inner recessed bands surround the entrance: the first is decorated with a twisted rope pattern and the second with flying celestials (vidhyd- dhara). Rectangular panels with dvdrapdla on the inside and half-human, half-snake figures on the outer side are carved at the base of the inner three bands. A broken dvdra-laldta-bimba panel with Gaja-Laksmi hangs from the bottom of the lintel which is carved with the nine planets (navagraha). The course above this slab is decorated with candraidld; this molding and the recess above, separate the doorframe from the triratha, relief gandi of pidha above. The recess (baranda) above the entire doorway, which separates the bada of the deul from the gandi, is carved with a seated goddess, probably Durgd, who is flanked by two figures.14 At the east jagamohana entrance, the guardians of the eight directions (dikpdla) are carved on the outer pilasters which support the lower eave of the roof (pl. i i). Around the door from the lower left are Indra, Agni and tentatively, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna (missing), Vdyu, Kubera and isna."5 The next inner band is decorated with a diamond and flower pattern, the next with scrolls of human figures and vidhyddhara, and the inner one with a meandering scroll pattern. Gafigd (south) and Yamund (north) with attendants are placed in niches at the base of the inner two bands. The north jagamohana doorframe is architecturally the same as the east door but the sculpture is dissimilar (pl. I3). Here, the outer pilasters are carved with single figures and amorous couples (mithuna) and the top lintel contains representations of ascetics in yogic posture. In the dvara-lalitda-bimba panel is a broken image of Lakullia who holds the lakuta on his left shoulder, and two of his disciples appear on lotuses in the upper corners. The guardian niches at the base contain a lion-faced Saivite figure on the proper right and a female on the left. 14 On the Somesvara temple, seated Durga is represented in the rectangle at the base of the gandion the north side of the temple, the more common side for Durga. 15 K.

The only other figural sculpture on the deul is blocked out in the panel below the south pdrivadevata- niche (pl. 22). The images will be described in the order they are seen doing pradaksina or circumambulation from the east. On the south half of the jagamohana: East side, south niche (pl. 14): SURYA stands totally frontal (sarnbhahga), holding a lotus in each hand. Two attendants, Dandi and Pifigala, stand in the lower corners; before the proper right figure, one of the arrow-shooting goddesses Us- and Pratyusa remains. Below, the charioteer Aruna drives the seven (?) horses. A halo surrounds Surya's head, and two vidhyddhara inhabit the upper corners; the same motifs are repeated in all the sculptures on this deul and jagamohana.16 South side, east niche: (pl. 15): SARASWATI, the goddess of music and learning, sits on a lotus throne playing the vind with her two front hands and holding a white lotus (pundarika) and manuscript (pustaka) in her upper right and left hands. South side, second niche (pl. 16): NATARAJA is eight-armed. He holds a skull cup in his lower right hand, his second hand presents the reassurance gesture or abhaya mudrd, and the third holds a kettle-drum. A snake is held in the upper two hands and then trifila. The third left hand touches Parvati's face as she watches him dance and his lower left hand points to his upraised foot. His vahana Nandi stands behind and a drummer in the lower left accompanies Siva's dance. South side, fourth niche (pl. 17): KALA (?) is eight-armed, urdhvalihga, and seated on a lotus throne with leg pendant. It is an ugra (horrifying) form of Siva with cork-screw curled hair and a sacred thread (yajfopavita) of skulls. He holds in his proper right hands a knife, a sword, a spear and a drum, and in the left hands, a shield, a trident (?) and a bell in the lower hand. A flying figure looks up at the god from below the throne and next to this figure is an owl on the proper left. South side, west niche (pl. 18): DURGA is seated on a lotus throne supported by a stem. The goddess is eight-armed but some of her weapons are indistinct. The lower hands are in gift- giving (varada) and reassurance (abhaya) mudrd and the upper hands on her right hold a short spear (iakti) and on the left, shield and bow. West side, south niche: Empty. On the deul the images are: East side, south niche (pl. I9): GATIGA stands on a broken makara and is adorned with earrings, an elaborate coiffure to her right and is two- armed. Her right hand rests on her thigh and her left holds a water pot. She stands tribhahga under an umbrella held by one of her attendants.

She stands again in the lower proper left after her descent." Ganig-dhara's lower right hand is in the varada mudrd and the left hands hold a pot and trisula. The figure in the lower proper right is undoubtedly Bhagiratha, a king who prayed for Gaiga- to descend and purify the ashes of the sons of King Sagara. West side, south niche (pl. 24): ARDHANARI stands tribhahga and his left half which is Parvati has a short coiffure, breast and garments clinging to the left leg; the upper hand probably held a mirror, as the image on the north deul does, and the lower hand holds a lotus to her lion vdhana. The male half of Ardhanari is urdhvalihiga, and has piled locks; his upper hand holds a trident and the lower is extended in the giftgiving varada mudrd to the anthropomorphic form of his bull vdhana Nandi. West side, central niche (pl. 25): KARTTIKEYA sits with leg pendant and resting on the plumage of his peacock vdhana. His hair is swept back and cascades in three parts down his back; he is bejeweled with a tiger-claw necklace; the folds of his garment hang over the throne.

The eight-armed image on the north deul lacks the short club and thunderbolt but otherwise is exactly the same. North side, east niche (pl. 29): SIVA stands dvibhahiga, wears a yajnopavita, a necklace, earrings and a girdle, which holds a dhoti in place around his hips. His hair is arranged in curls on top of his head. The upper hands hold a lotus and axe; his lower right hand is broken, but the lower left hand extends in the gift-giving varada mudra to a gana (dwarf). Another gana stands on the lower right. East side, north niche (pl. 20): YAMUNA, the second river goddess, is a mirror image of Ganfiga on the south but stands on a kurma or tortoise. On the north half of the jagamohana: West side, north niche (pl. 30): PARVATI is seated on a throne with her right leg pendant; two attendants stand below the throne. Her hair is piled on her head; she wears earrings, a necklace, and a yajiopavita which falls between her breasts and over her abdomen. The upper hands hold a lotus bud and a trifula; her lower left holds a skull cup and her lower right extends in the varada mudrd. Two vidhyddhara fly overhead. North side, west niche (pl. 31): KALI (?), a horrifying (ugra) female figure is seated on a lotus throne with her right leg pendant. Beneath the throne are the flying figure and owl which appear beneath the image of Kila (?) on the south side. She wears a yajiopavita of skulls, earrings and necklace and holds a skull cup and trifula with skull in her left hands, and a spear and drum (?) in her right hands. Her hair is arranged in cork-screw curls with a skull in front. To my knowledge, this is the only image of a horrifying goddess with a youthful body in Kalinga, or in related traditions of Orissa. North side, second niche from west (pl. 32): visNu is seated cross legged (padmasana) on a throne and Garuda, his vdhana, is below. His left hands hold the sankha and gada and the lower right hand is in varada mudra; the other is broken. In addition to earrings, necklaces and the yajfiopavita, Visnu wears a garland of flowers around his body and over both arms. North side, second niche from the east (pl. 33): BRAHMA sits on a lotus throne which rises from a stem. His hair is piled into jatamukta on each of the three heads; the lower proper right hand is in the varada mudra and the upper left holds a noose. The other symbols are indistinct but may have been a rosary (lower left) and water vessel (upper right). North side, east niche (pl. 34): UMA-MAHESVARA sit with right legs resting on their respective bull and lion vahana beneath the throne. Both are elaborately coiffured and wear earrings, necklaces and yajIopavita. Siva's lower right hand is in the reassuring (abhaya) mudrd; the upper holds a trifula while his upper left arm reaches around Parvati to caress her breast. Parvati sits on Siva's knee and faces him; a mirror is in her left hand and her right hand is broken. East side, north niche (pl. 35): The large cresent moon behind the head identifies the frontally standing figure as CANDRA. The narratives on the edges of the eave and clerestory of the jagamohana roof remain unidentified but an image of Ravana in the center of the south upper edge suggests that at least parts of the Rdmdyana epic are represented there (pl. io). There is no question that the four deul at Narayanapuram were constructed at the same time by the same workshop. All the deul have the following characteristics in common: triratha walls (bada); the same 259</page><page sequence="29">moldings (pdbhdga), indented below at least the parivadevata- niches; niches with relief gandi of pidha (pidha mundi); one molding and a recess (baranda) above the deul walls which is uninterrupted by the design on the central projection (rdhd) of the gandi. The gandi of the north and the Nilakantheivara deul (both rekha deul) and that of the kkhdakhard shrine consist of stories marked by dmld and lotus carved courses; the central projections (rdhd) of these three deul gandi are blocked out at the base with rectangular panels within circular patterns coordinated with the story divisions (bhbimi). In addition, a comparison of the pdirvadevata of the Nilakanthesvara and north deul reinforces the conclusion that all work at the site was the production of one workshop. Other than a discrepancy in size between the images on the north deul (45 x70 cm.) and those on the Nilakanthe'vara deul (70 x IIo cm.), and minor iconographic differences, sculptures on both deul are exactly the same in style. The images of Ganesa are alike in form and decorative details such as necklaces, emblems, halo around the head, flying celestials above and lotus throne legs (pl. 4 &amp; pl. 22); the two-armed Karttikeyas only differ in the proper left hand symbols: a bell on the north deul image and cock on the larger deul image (pl. 5 &amp; pl. 25) and the Mahisasuramardini on the Nilakanthegvara deul is ten-armed rather than eight, as on the small deul (pl. 6 &amp; pl. 28). A brief comparison of the architecture and the pairvadevatd of the Nilakantheivara with those of the Someivara deul in Mukhalifigam is necessary to establish the date of the four Narayanapuram deul. A comparison of the two will also indicate what architectural embellishments could have been carved on the four uncompleted Narayanapuram deul. No ninth or tenth century deul in Kalinga has completed decorative details, although almost all sculptures have been carved. The Someivara deul, however, has sufficient embell- ishments finished to make comprehensible the overall program. The Some vara deul is one of three deul in Mukhalifigam, a village on the east bank of the Varhiadh-ar- River in Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh (fig. i). It is 17/2 feet square, which is close to the size of the Nilakantheivara, but in contrast to that deul, faces west and today possesses no jagamohana before the garbha grha entrance, although it is quite likely that a jagamohana was originally constructed here also.19 (fig. 6 &amp; pl. 36) Even though the two deul face opposite cardinal directions, both are oriented to nearby rivers. All the images present on the Nilakantheavara deul are present on the Someivara deul, although those images on the east and west walls are exchanged because the Someivara deul faces west (fig. 7). The western direction of the Some vara deul, the placement of Gang- in the southwest niche and Ganeka as the south pdrivadevatd would seem to indicate that circumambulation of this temple was done counterclockwise. A comparison of the pdarvadevatd of the Nilakanthesvara deul with those of the Someivara deul in Mukhalifigam will reveal striking similarities in sculptural style and iconography at the two sites, even though minor differences exist. The images of Ganesa are the most comparable (pl. 22 &amp; pl. 39). Both figures sit on double lotus petal thrones with the right leg dangling over the cushions; both hold an axe and bowl of sweetmeats in the left hands and a radish in the upper right hand, but the Nilakantheivara image holds a rosary in the lower right hand which is in the varada mudrd while the Someivara image only extends an empty hand. On both images, the head, ears, arms, neck and ankles are adorned with jewels and the yajnopavtta is entwined snakes. Two figures (vidhyddhara or gandharva) fly at the sides of the halos surrounding the heads. The rat vdhana moves toward another dish of sweetmeats below the thrones. The Karttikeya images have much in common: both are seated on thrones with pendant right legs which rest on the plumage of the peacock vahana below (pl. 29 &amp;t pl. 37, center). Folds of their garments hang over the edge of the throne; both wear belts, jeweled sacred threads, tiger-claw necklaces and hair piled on their heads, although in different styles. The Nilakantheivara image holds a spear in the proper right hand and the left covers a cock; the Someivara Karttikeya holds a fruit in his right hand which rests on his knee, but the right hand is broken.20 One other difference between the two is that the Someivara Karttikeya, and the 19 Linda, pp. 216-217. 20 Thomas Donaldson, Hindi Temple Art of Orissa, vol. I (Leiden: E.J. Brill, I985), p. 250 says Klrttikeya held a spear (1akti)but B. Masthanaiah, The Temples of Mukhali7gam (New Delhi: np., 1978), p. 66 claims he held a cock. 260</page><page sequence="30">Mahis-suramardini there, are practically carved in the round. A frame of stone stabilizes the base and arms of the images while the torsos are totally freed from the stone. In form, dramatic stance, anthropormorphic form of Mahisisura and her lion vdhana biting the leg of the demon from the proper left, the Mahisasuramardini of the Nilakanthesvara and Someivara deul are alike (pl. 28). In addition, from the lower proper right, they both hold a wheel, thunderbolt (vajra), trifula (broken at Narayanapuram), long sword overhead, quiver and bow and short club. The image at Narayanapuram, however, then holds a bow, axe, the noose around the demon's neck and an oval arm shield. The Somesvara image in contrast holds a conch in the second right hand from the top. The east wall of the Someivara deul is most useful for indicating methods of construction and progression of carving on deul (pl. 37). Clearly all stones for the deul itself were put in place, and then all images and embellishment of the niche pilasters were completed. Decorative details of the mundi gandi and the gandi ofthe deul itself were left to last. The wall (bdda) is divided into three parts (triratha) by the pdrivadevatd niche, which projects from the badda, and by two subsidiary (dvaranadevatd) niches. A baranda consisting of a molding, recessed area, and top molding, separates the bdda from the gandi of the deul. Four moldings (pdbhdga) support the dvaranadevatd niches, while the pdrivadevatd niche rises above two compressed moldings. Broad pilasters around all mundi are intricately carved with figural and floral reliefs. Two thin bands with floral and geometric designs recede from the outer niche pilasters to the image in the niche. Above the pdrivadevata niche, the gandi consists of an eave and four triratha pidha. The pi.dha are blocked out with a band along the lower edge, and triangles flanked by small squares are repeated in each third of every pid.ha. Only the triangles on the lowest pid.ha course have been partially carved into candrasdald motifs. Above the side niches, three pid.ha, an upturned course carved with lotus petals and a tall pid.ha course rise to the baranda. On the northeast Hari-Hara niche, carving was begun on the two lowest pidha. On the southeast Ardhina-ri niche however, all the motifs have been completed. Floral or geometric patterns were carved along the bottom edge; standing on the band are small candra~dld or animal motifs flanked by even smaller designs: animals flanking the candradlSd motifs and floral designs next to the pairs of animals. At N-arayanapuram, the blocked-out band with triangles flanked by small squares on all thepidha of the Nilakantheivara niches, and on the niches of the other three deul there, indicate that the design partially completed on the Somesvara was possible, but never done (pl. 9). This same decorative pattern is repeated on the horizontal courses of the Some vara gandi (pl. 38). Thegandi is divided vertically into five divisions (paficaratha) by thin recesses, and the seven stories (bhumi) are marked by dmld in the outer divisions (kanika) and lotus-carved courses in the inner (anaratha) divisions. Each bhumi is three horizontal courses, the bottom one blocked out with an incomplete candraidld motif flanked by smaller squares. The upper two courses are joined by a similar candrasdild motif and side squares. These same details might eventually have been added on the gandi of the Nilakantheivara deul, the north deul and the khdkhard shrine at Narayanapuram (pl. 3 &amp; 8). (The south temple with the pid.ha gandi, however, could not have been carved this way.) If this decorative embellishment had been completed on the Someivara and the three Narayanapuram deul, a single line of candraidld in each vertical division, interrupted by dmld or lotus-petal courses, would have been the final pattern, rather than the lattice work (j~dla) pattern seen on tenth century temples in Bhubanervar (pl. 41). The more restrained decorative relief on these deul and the thin, shallow recesses between gandi vertical divisions, both of which emphasize the horizontality of the gandi courses, distinguish temple architecture in Kalinga from that in surrounding areas. The design at the base of the central projections of the two gandi would also have been quite similar (pl. 8 &amp; 38). On the Someivara, the bottom rectangular design has been more completely carved; the rectangle frames two pilasters which enclose an image; above the triangle, a fully circular candraidld with floral sprays on either side at the bottom and humans riding mythical beasts on either side at the top has been carved. On the Nilakantheivara gandi south rdhi, only the pilasters have been carved in the lower, rectangular form. In addition to the striking similarity in sculptural style and iconography, design and architectural embellish- ment, the entrances to the garbha griha of both deul are alike (pl. I2 &amp; pl. 36). Floral scrolls, carved on pilasters, 261</page><page sequence="31">meander from pots above the top molding to capitals which support an architrave carved with diamond-shaped floral patterns. Below these patterns on the Some vara, reliefs of three pidha gandi with amlid on top are carved; on the Nilakanthesvara deul, a single triratha gandi of pidha with one dmld is in relief. Beneath these reliefs on both doorways are the nine planets (navagraha). Pendant from the planet panel on both temples is a dvZdra- laldta-bimba with Gaja-Laksmi bathed by two elephants. Three sculpted recessed bands surround the doorways. At the base of these bands are niches with dvdrapdla. The Someivara deul has been dated from the second half of the ninth century to the mid-eleventh century by various scholars.21 An early tenth century date, based on comparison with the Muktesvara temple in Bhubanes- var, which it precedes, is most appropriate. Therefore, the four Narayanapuram deul, which are so much like the Someivara deul in detail that they could have been done by the same workshop, are also dateable to the early tenth century. As mentioned above, these four deul at Narayanapuram are the latest extant temples in the early medieval Kalifiga tradition. Beginning in the tenth century, Kalifiga was the focus of military activity by the Eastern Calukyas of Vefigi and the Somavariii kings of Daksina Ko6ala which produced political and social upheaval, precluding continued erection of temples. In the early eleventh century, the Colas of the south overran both Vengi and Kalifiga. By A.D. Io03o however, Vajrahasta, the first of the rulers known as the Later Gafigas, descendent of the Early Gafigas or offspring of another branch, rose again in Kalifiga. His grandson, Anantavarman Codagafiga regained all of Kalifiga and extended the territory to include large parts of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa by A.D. i 112. The centuries intervening between the eclipse of the Early Gafigas and the establishment of the Later Gafiga dynasty allowed development of architectural specifications different enough to be termed later Medieval. 21 Douglas Barrett [D. Barrett and M.A. Dikshit, Temples of Mukhalingam, Sirpur and Rajim (Bombay: N.M. Tripathi Private Ltd., I960), p. 5-12] claims it is from the second half of the ninth century; M.Rama Rao, The Temples ofKalinga (Tirupati: Sri Venkatesvara University, I965) provides no date; N.S. Ramaswami, Monograph on Temples ofMukhali~igam (Hyderabad: The Government of Andhra Pradesh, I976), pp. I4-I7 says it is the earliest of the three temples there (pre-tenth century); Masthanaiah, pp. 36-38 claims it is mid-eleventh century and Donaldson, Hindu Temple, pp. 247-253, early tenth century, before the Muktesvara temple in Bhubanesvar to which he compares the Somesvara temple. 262</page></plain_text>
