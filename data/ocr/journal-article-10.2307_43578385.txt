AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI* Abstract: After a brief parallel presentation of the development of the Upper Paleolithic cultures in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Near East we propose a new paradigm for the issue of the process, that is to say, the birth of Neolithization. Instead of a sudden appareance within a few centuries around 9000 BP, we think that the phenomenon is the result of a long and chaotic story which began independently in both continents more than 35,000 years ago. After many attempts which failed one after the other due to the severe and repeated climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene and/or due to the lack of ' understanding ' vegetal and animal species which were 'ready* to 'accept' domestication, the success arrived in very precise environmental and climatic conditions at the beginning of the Holocene in only one of the two regions, the Near East. If Neolithization doesn't appear earlier it's not because 'culture' was not ready, but because 'nature' was not able to give a favourable answer to the request of man. Résumé : Après une brève mise en parallèle du développement des cultures du Paléolithique supérieur en Europe centrale et orientale ainsi qu'au Proche-Orient, nous proposons un nouveau modèle de l'achèvement de ce processus, c'est-à-dire l'apparition de la néolithisation. Plutôt que d'admettre une apparition soudaine en quelques siècles autour de 9000 BP, nous pensons que ce phénomène est l'aboutissement d'une histoire longue et chaotique commencée de manière indépendante sur les deux continents il y a plus de 35 000 ans. Après plusieurs tentatives qui ont échoué à la suite de fluctuations climatiques sévères et répétées à la fin du Pleistocène, et/ ou à la suite du « refus » de certaines espèces végétales ou animales de se laisser alors domestiquer, le succès s'est produit dans des circonstances environnementales et climatiques précises au début de l'Holocène dans l'une des deux régions seulement, le Proche- Orient. Si la néolithisation n'est pas apparue plus tôt, ce n'est pas parce que la ' culture ' n'était pas prête, mais parce que la ' nature ' n'était pas en mesure de donner une réponse favorable à la demande de l'homme.

KOZLOWSKI "Following approximately 15,000 years ago, as the last major phase of the Pleistocene ice age was ending, our species began setting foot in the direction of a new threshold. By that time almost all the habitable parts of the world that could be occupied by people having only hunting-collecting economy - however intensified - had been filled. When fully achieved, the threshold was a way of life that depended on the actual production of the supply of food, through the domestication of plants and, usually, of animals. Had the new threshold not been fully crossed, we would still all be hunter- collectors ; whether happier than we now are or not, I cannot guess." (Braidwood 1978) INTRODUCTION The parallel development of the Upper and Final Paleolithic cultures in Central and Eastern Europe, on the one hand, and in the Near East, on the other hand, has never been studied in details. In the Near East, the succession of those cultures led right there to neolithization, that is, to the transformation from societies of hunter-gatherers to societies of farmers and herd- ers, while in Europe that transformation did only take place with impetus from outside, impetus coming in fact from the Near East. Why was that? A close look at the literature brings forth some sketchy comparisons. For instance, the Natufian of the Near East (12,500-10,300 BP) is set side by side with the epi-Gravettian cultures of Mezin/Mezhirichi (15,000-14,000 BP), which are more than two thousand years older (Edwards 1989; Bar Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 2002). Much more recently, several authors have proposed to compare, in the sphere of art, the art of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe and that of the Neolithic in the Near East (Perlés 2011; Wengrow 2011). On the other hand, not long since, the accent was rather put on a break between the Neolithic and the preceding cultures, in order to justify the Neolithic "Revolution" (Cauvin 2000). Several authors insist now, at least with regard to the Near East, on the continuity between the Epi-Paleolithic, even the Upper Paleolithic, and the Neolithic (Kaufman 1992; Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2002; Verhoeven 2011; Belfer-Cohen and Goring-Morris 2011). In a more general way, the cognitive development of humankind is considered to be complete by the Upper Paleolithic period, meaning that, theoretically, the intellectual or cognitive capacities for Neolithization had been fully acquired (Watkins 2011 and also 2010). With a few rare exceptions we prefer to leave aside the soci- ological implications of that development. At the present state of knowledge they too often seem to be based on speculation. We do not deny that those attempts are of interest, but in our opinion they reveal at least as much of the respective prehisto- rian's personality (or of the school to which he adheres) as of the reality lived by prehistoric man, to whom those hypotheses apply. Hie et nunc , we had much rather hold on to the facts of material culture. We think that the time has come to take up the problem at a more general level, including an effort to overcome separations between disciplines: not all specialists in European prehistory are familiar with Near-Eastern prehistory, and vice versa! The first question that comes to mind is this: since when did Paleolithic societies possess the "technical package" - the only possible approach for the prehistorian - and therewith the intellectual capacities needed for the transformation into Neolithic societies? Looking for an answer to that question one could try to understand why the former (Europe) failed and the latter (Near East) succeeded. We must explain the notion of "failed Neolithization" contained in the subtitle of this article. One can look at the evolution of man from several viewpoints: one may consider this evolution as perfectly linear ; starting from a point A, the Paleolithic civilizations, and reaching a point B, the civi- lizations of the 21st century AD. One might even (and why not?) allow for an intermediary stage, A', representing the Neolithic, which is a 'descendant' of point A and at the same time an 'ancestor' of point B. One could not even deny that, looked at from Sirius, there exists continuity , progression, though not progress... (see for evidence Braidwood's remark cited above). Taking a closer look, one realizes that this continuity does exist but cannot hide all the breaks or setbacks that have accompanied the evolution and that, in any case, the evolu- tion came about neither everywhere, nor at the same time and nor always following the same rhythm. Continuous at first sight, evolution is really the result of a series of suc- cessive discontinuities . In 1919 - a date of some importance for Europe - Paul Valéry, who was not prehistorian but a poet and a philosopher, characterized that situation by the following sentence: «Nous autres, civilisations, nous savons maintenant que nous sommes mortelles». ["We, the civilized Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="3">To be or not to be. . . Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 7 people, know by now that we are mortal."] The "maintenant" (by now) is important: it needs some distance to appreciate the quasi-biological evolution of any civilization: its birth, growth and death. We have since enough distance to appreciate the ways that prehistoric cultures came off and how they were intertwined. To use a comparison, which may be more familiar to prehisto- rians, one might also talk of 'cultural oscillations', just as 'cli- matic oscillations' exist with sometimes beneficent, sometimes dramatic consequences. All along the Quaternary, each one of those cultures has, in its time and at its place, undergone its proper evolution with alternating 'successes' and 'failures' - just as warm and humid climates (the 'successes'?) have alter- nated with cold and dry climates (the 'failures'?). We should like to focus on a particular moment of that evolution - an evo- lution that seems to have had a rougher going than we may have imagined. In order to judge those technical and intellectual capacities of a culture one has to tackle the problem from the end, and, according to Verhoeven's suggestion, to "unwrap the package" (Verhoeven 2011) of those societies that are considered to be Neolithic, and examine its contents. Which elements were at the disposal of the first societies that 'mastered' Neolithization, that is, according to our definition, those that finally mastered agriculture and animal domestication? In the Near East, this result is definitely reached around 9000 BP (Aurenche et al. 2001). Have no attempts been made elsewhere and earlier? There is also the question after the conditions under which that result was achieved. In this text we take into account the whole Near East and Eastern Europe between the middle Danube and the Volga (fig. 1). By convention and in order to facilitate comparisons, dates are given BP without calibration. The time concerned extends from ca 35,000 to 7000 BP. THE NEOLITHIC PACKAGE From all those elements in the 'technical package' the first that comes to mind is the capacity to settle, that is, to stay in the same place for several seasons, or, at least, to come back to the same site in a recurrent and durable manner. This new conduct (see below) seems in fact to be one, if not the only condition needed to get the process of neolithization going, because this process has finally brought about populations whose sedentary character is beyond doubt. Archaeologically, the first sign of sedentism is the con- struction of a stable and permanent habitat , an action that asks for a bigger effort than the erection of a simple temporary shelter. In addition to the traces left by those constructions, the permanence of the habitat is usually indicated by the pres- ence of structures for storage : the most visible are often pits or structures installed inside or near the habitat. When a suf- ficient number of presumably contemporary constructions are found at the same site, one may attempt to study the collective organization of the inhabited place. Another one of those recurring elements is the presence of heavy stone industry , mortars, grinding-stones, pestles, hand- stones which, because of their weight, are difficult to trans- port - other than just once from the place where they were retrieved or made. Wooden objects that may have served the same purposes are seldom preserved. When the group or part of the group went on his seasonal wanderings, those heavy tools were left behind. In a more symbolic manner, we associate settling with the existence of burials in or near the habitat. This 'appropriation' of places seems to fit well the decision to stay at or to return period- ically to the same site, which has become a place of memory. Two of the new techniques for material transformation will be considered: polishing of stone and pyrotechnology . While the former has long been regarded as the unique, quasi universal sign of the appearing Neolithic age, the latter is less often mentioned. At any rate, it is a matter of putting to prac- tice empirical knowledge in the fields of physics and chemistry in order to use fire for the 'burning' of clay - we are not talking about ceramics, which, for a long time, has also been consid- ered an 'absolute' criterion of neolithization - or to produce lime or plaster. As a rule, we will not be concerned with the chipped stone industry: only some tools in use there can help to character- ize the Neolithic more specifically. In a different approach we shall take into consideration techniques that leave fewer traces, such as weaving and basket-making. It is difficult to maintain that those two techniques were only mastered by societies on their way to neolithization, but there they seem to have been well entrenched. In the category of remains that belong a priori rather to the symbolic or spiritual realm than to the utilitarian, objects will be considered that, for lack of a better term, are called 'artistic', namely zoomorphic and especially anthropomorphic statuettes (sculpted and carved) or figurines (modeled). Those representations by man of his own species seem to constitute a decisive stage in the process of neolithization. Finally, the question will be addressed of how those popu- lations were able to manage long distances, including over sea, as is revealed by a increasing number of recent discoveries.

That is what the technical package looks like that charac- terizes the societies whose internal evolution has led to neoli- thization as defined above. Next will be considered the way in which those societies exploited the plants and animals of their environment, because it was in their midst that gathering and hunting very soon (see below) made way for agriculture and the raising of livestock - the point where the process ended which occupies us here. After a review of the evolution of those cultures which in Europe as well as in the Near East have shown such capacities, we shall - in an effort to understand why what has failed here has succeeded elsewhere - come back to the question after the pertinence of the criteria considered. CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (35,000-7000 BP) BEGINNINGS OF NEOLITHIZATION IN THE AURIGNACIAN (34,000-26,000 BP) The first innovations belonging to the Neolithic package appear since the Aurignacian in Greece (fig. 1). Levels IV and III a-g of the Klisoura cave on the Peloponnese (34,000- 32,000 and 26,000 BP) have delivered the first evidence of the use of burned clay to coat the walls of basins with a diameter of 35 to 45 cm and a depth of 5 to 10 cm. The clay derives from the valley floor, from red paleosoils about 1 km away, it was prepared for the purpose and burnt at a tem- perature between 400 and 600°C. The basins are arranged in circles around large low hearths put right on the ground, nei- ther dug in nor built up (Pawlikowski et al. 2000; Karkanas et al. 2004). Those terracotta basins were probably used to cook vegetables, especially grains of Chenopodium sp. or the fruits of Polygonum sp., the phytoliths of which were found in Aurignacian levels. The list of vegetal macro-remains becomes longer (in particular that of graminaceous plants), especially in the upper levels, indicating a more intensive consumption of vegetal food, along with game (especially Lepus , Equus hydrontinus and Dama). The Aurignacians have often come back to the cave, as it is attested by the long sequence of hearths and terracotta basins superimposed one upon the other with, in that part of the cave, a small amount of sedimentation. The perimeter of moves was limited: all lithic material is of local origin. The sea mollusks come from a beach about 10 km away. Probably, stays in the cave took mainly place in the fall. The Aurignacians from Klisoura may be regarded as teth- ered nomads coming from one center, without any system- atic connection with secondary centers (Ingold 1980). They have 'invented' the use of burnt clay for the preparation of vegetal food. This invention precedes the use of burnt clay by Gravettian groups in Central Europe (around 28,000 BP). The Aurignacians in Greece lived during the temperate periods of the Interpleniglacial (GI 6,5; fig. 2) in an environment made of a phytogeographic patchwork. The first Gravettians, on the other hand, lived in the "mammoth steppe" at the time of a decline of temperature corresponding to the Heinrich Event 3.

KOZLOWSKI THE FIRST PRE-PLENIGLACIAL GRAVETTIAN APOGEE: THE BEGINNINGS OF NEOLITHIZATION WITH THE MAMMOTH-HUNTERS Towards the end of the Interpleniglacial, in the classical Gravettian phases of Central Europe, between 28,000 and 24,000 BP, as well as in the Late Gravettian phase of the Russian plain, between 24,000 and 22,000 BP, several innova- tions appear corresponding to the 'attributes' of the Neolithic as they have been presented above: a) semi-sedentism; b) organization of encampments, with 'solid' dwellings, possibly in a predetermined way; c) burials in or near the habitats; d) the importance of vegetal food; e) heavy stone industry; f) the technique of stone-polishing; g) the burning of clay, especially for objects that are not a priori useful; h) artistic expressions, such as the famous 'Venus'; i) the separation of domestic zones from spaces that are considered 'ceremonial'. All those innovations occur especially in two cultural units, the Pavlovian (middle Danube) and the Kostienkian (middle Don). THE PAVLOVIAN (28,000-24,000 BP) The Gravettian appears in Central Europe around 30,000 BP, but the facies on the middle Danube that is called Pavlovian evolves between 28,000 and 24,000 BP. The most important sites, those that show the greatest amount of features associ- ated with that 'neolithization', are situated around the Pavlov Hills, in the vicinity of Mikulov (Czech Republic). They are Dolni Věstonice I (Klíma 1963) and II (Klíma 1983; Svoboda ed. 1991), Pavlov I (Svoboda ed. 1994 and 1997) and II, and Milovice (Oliva ed. 2009). All those sites have been excavated over considerable areas: Dolni Věstonice I, ca 1220 m2; Dolni Věstonice II, ca 1300 m2; Pavlov, 1170 m2. They have yielded consider- able quantities of lithic remains: up to 156 per m2 in Dolni Věstonice I, 140 per m2 in Dolni Věstonice II and ca 300 per m2 in Pavlov I. All sites mentioned have provided impor- tant structures, built with wood, stones, bones, hides and per- haps also with wattle and daub (plecionki ), judging by the impressions in the clay. The structures belong to several, prob- ably contemporary, types: a) circular structures set on the ground and bordered by a rim of stones and bones, sometimes held together with mud. The superstructures were made of wood, which left traces in the form of post-holes. The most elaborate example was found in Dolni Věstonice I (upper site, unit 2: Klíma 1963). In that case, the structure was partly dug into the slope; b) circular structures set on the ground and bordered by a line of bones to which the superstructure made of vegetal ele- ments is fastened. Those structures attain a diameter of 8 m: in Dolni Věstonice I upper site (excavated by K. Absolon in 1938; Oliva 2007: fig. 5; on the plan published by Klíma [1983], the westernmost structure) and in Milovice sector G (Oliva ed. 2009); c) half-buried structures rather oval in plan (4 to 8 m in the major axis), with one or several hearths inside. The super- structure is made of vegetal elements covered with hides or with mud. This type occurs in Dolni Vestonice I, upper site, complexes 1 to 4 (Klíma 1983), in Dolni Vestonice II, middle part (Svoboda et al. 2002: fig. 74 b) and Pavlov 1, structures 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9 (Svoboda ed. 1997). Some of those structures, especially those with several hearths inside, may have just been shelters against the wind; d) hypothetical structures of the yurt type together with hearths that have left no trace of a wall except a few small post- holes: Dolni Vestonice II, middle part, west slope (Svoboda et al. 2002). The agglomerations formed by the most elaborate struc- tures at those sites are sometimes regarded as 'proto-villages'. In that case the structures ought to be contemporary. However, especially in the case of Pavlov I, micro-stratigraphic analyses show that they rather follow one upon the other. The question is the same for Dolni Vestonice I, upper site, where complexes 1 and 2 are far apart - leaving room for discussion. B. Klima's interpretation of 1963 becomes doubtful again: he had attrib- uted different functions to each of the two complexes, consid- ering complex 1 as 'domestic' with a large range of activities, and complex 2, which is closer to the summit, as 'shamanistic', with ceremonial activities such as the modeling and burning of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic clay statuettes. On the other hand, there is no doubt that those sites were occupied over a long period, with periodical returns, as is attested by radiometric datings and by enormous accumu- lations of tools and of lithic and bone waste as well as by impressive quantities of mammoth bones in the shape of kjok- kenmöddings (kitchen middens) like in Dolni Vestonice I and Milovice (Klíma 1963 and 2001). The Pavlovians were attracted by the north slopes of the Pavlov mountains. Certain engravings on ivory have been sup- Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="7">To be or not to be. . . Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 1 1 posed to represent landscapes or even a 'map' of the region (Klíma 1988). This attractiveness was probably due to the diversity of the environment in contrast with the "mammoth steppe", which was considered periglacial. Until recently, the opinion prevailed that the open space underwent important falls in temperature, especially in winter. But it was probably not like that: analyses of the stable isotopes of animal bones from the mammoth steppe show an average of 4 to 8 degrees less than at present, or of 5 to 7 degrees, according to the anal- ysis of fox's teeth, which provide temperature indices over a period of 6 months. Mammoth teeth provide averages over a longer period, with larger differences. Pollen diagrams confirm the existence of a steppe-forest, especially in the lower regions, with conifers and, in protected gorges, even with deciduous trees (Opravil 1994). The gorges of the Pavlov mountains were favorable to hunting the mam- moth and also medium-sized mammals, such as the wolf, or smaller ones, like the hare. Other indications confirm the importance of vegetable-collecting: a) the use of vegetal fibers (stinging nettle) for weaving is attested by impressions in textile, with at least seven different types (Adovasio et al. 1997); b) vegetable remains in micro-morphologic investigations of the hearths confirm that vegetables were part of the food supply, for example in Dolni Věstonice II (Mason et al. 1994); c) grinding-material such as pecked grinding- stones and handstones have been found in Pavlov I, northwest sector (Skrdla 1997: fig. 28; Svoboda ed. 1997: fig. 6 sup.), tools that can also be used to grind colors. At any rate, recent traceo- logical examinations of the Pavlov VI (28-29,000 BP) grind- ers have shown that they were used in the treatment of plants, especially Typha and perhaps Botrichium (Reverdin et al. 2010). Similar results have been obtained for grinders from other sites dated around 28,000 BP: Bilancino in Italy and Kostienki 16 in the Russian plain. Among the vegetal macro- remains from Dolni Vestonice there have been registered eat- able roots ( Asteraceae ) and starch cells. With regard to the importance of collecting, the Pavlovians cannot be considered as hunters practicing "tethered nomad- ism", but, in view of their connection with fixed points, as adherents of "fixed point nomadism" (Ingold 1980). There remains the question of semi-sedentism and of the seasonal occupation of the principal sites. Faunai studies distinctly attest occupation in wintertime, a result confirmed by traceological studies (frozen material, Tomášková 1994). Anthracological studies add evidence of occupation in the fall (Opravil 1994), but we lack indications for occupation in spring or summer. One might suggest that, in those periods, the Pavlovians leave the central sites and move to regions further north. Those moves are confirmed by the ongoing supply with raw mate- rials from South Poland (Kozlowski J.K. ed. 1989). But it is also possible that the sites in the Pavlov mountains were occu- pied all year round and that in spring and summer only 'task groups' moved towards Silesia. The presence of burials in direct relation to the habitats strengthens the hypothesis of sedentism. In Dolni Vestonice I were registered two isolated skulls and two burials (a woman and a child). The two burials in Dolni Vestonice II are more directly linked to the habitat: burial DV16, male, is directly associated with a hearth of the final occupation phase on the west slope; the skull was covered with red ochre (Svoboda et Vlček 1991; Vandiver et al. 1989). The other burial (DV 13-15), a triple one, contained two male sub-adults and a third individual of undetermined sex. The skeletons seem to have been protected by a wooden construction which was consumed by fire. The other known Pavlovian burials were located out- side of any structures (Pavlov I), or even outside of habitats (Brno 2); in that case, the skeletons were covered with mam- moth shoulder blades (Svoboda et al. 2002). A collective grave is also known from Predmosti (Müller- Karpe 1966). The first beginnings of Neolithization are also observable by technological innovations, like the polishing of stone not only to produce grinding material (Skrdla 1997) but also jew- elry such as the large round and pierced pendant in the Brno 2 burial (Oliva 1996). The other technological innovation is the fabrication of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracotta figurines (hippopotamus, mammoth). There are even some specialized workshops (Dolni Vestonice I upper site) with a domed kiln to bake the figurines (Vandiver et al. 1990). Recently, almost complete skeletons of wolves have been identified next to Pavlov I habitats (1952-1956 excavations). At present, they are under study by P. Wojtal and J. Wilczynski (pers. comm.). The changes in anatomy compared to that of current wolf populations of the period could be due either to a sexual dimorphism or to beginning domestication. The new results of analyses of bones from Predmosti confirm also the initial domestication of dogs and the mixing of wild and domestic dogs (Germonpré et al. 2012). In the 'symbolic' and artistic sphere, statuettes of women appear with marked sexual characteristics. This phenomenon is not limited to the Pavlovian, but is characteristic of the whole European Gravettian (Svoboda 2007; Delporte 1993; Verpoorte 2001). Though it comes earlier, this phenomenon evokes the apparition, in the Neolithic period, of the 'mother- goddesses' or 'goddesses of fecundity' in a great part of Europe, but starting in the Near East.

KOZLOWSKI does not fit the interpretation of Paleolithic art which prevails at present, namely the shamanistic hypothesis. There are two possible explications, both applicable to Neolithic symbolism: fertility magic or a social structure which accorded women a particular status. The Gravettian statuettes or zoomorphic figu- rines made of ivory, stone or clay also remind one of Neolithic representations, but their signification - especially in the case of the zoo-anthropomorphic statuettes - would chime in bet- ter with shamanism than with fertility magic. This hypothesis rests on the differences to be observed between represented species and hunted species. In the Pavlovian sites, the works of art represent above all bears, lions and rhinos, species that are very rare among the hunted fauna. Those impressive and dan- gerous animals, that are not part of the subsistence economy, may have played a role in shamanistic ceremonies. The development of Pavlovian societies stops around 24,000 BP, probably because of the climatic decline of the Heinrich Event 2, by which the peak of the last glaciation (LGM, OIS2) announces itself. There is a growing mobil- ity among the Gravettian groups as well as a demographic crisis, which shows in the diminishing number of sites and which perhaps coincides with the emigration of some of those groups - already belonging to the Willendorf-Kostienki hori- zon (Kozlowski J.K. 2008) - towards the Russian plain. That is probably why that first sketchy organization of Pavlovian cultures, that might have resulted in neolithization, has failed. THE KOSTIENKIAN (24,000-20,000 BP) Between 24,000 and 20,000 BP the Gravettians of the Russian plain show on their part several features of "proto- Neolithization". Two important innovations are added to those that have been pointed out for the Pavlovian of Moravia: the organization of large sites according to a predetermined plan and the storing of food. The sites are grouped along the banks of big rivers like the Don. Surrounded by the cold steppe, the valleys provided a woodier environment, also at the outlet of the gorges cut into the plateau. That mosaic of differentiated environments attracted Gravettian groups, as it allowed the establishment of longer-lived sites. In the Kostienkian 'proto-villages' appear built after a pre- conceived plan: Kostienki I on the middle Don (complex 1, Efimenko 1958; complex 2, Praslov and Rogatchev 1982) and Avdeevo on the Seim (Gvozdover 1961). In Kostienki I, com- plex 1, an oval surface of 37 x 22 m was exposed, surrounded by pits three of which - irregular ovals - are considered yami- zemlyanki or 'pit houses'. A dozen smaller, circular pits have diameters of 1-2 m or 2-3 m. In the center of the oval surface nine hearths are aligned along the major axis. The pit houses were covered with domed superstructures resting on mam- moth tusks. The second complex in Kostienki I, an oval of 27 x 22 m, was surrounded by 10 pits, also oval, of 5 x 2 m. Three of them were double ovals, probably also half-buried habitations covered with mammoth bones. Praslov and Rogatchev (1982) estimate their height at 1.80 m, allowing 0.60 m for the subter- ranean part. In Avdeevo only part of the complex has been excavated: 20 m wide and 25 m long, suggesting a total length of close to 50 m. The excavated part yielded seven pit houses, oval, with a length of 4 to 5 m in the major axis, and separated by eight round pits with a diameter of 2 m. The row of central hearths along the longitudinal axis of the complex was badly preserved. The complexes have yielded a very large amount of lithic artefacts: 44,000 from Kostienki complex 1; 11,000 from Kostienki complex 2; 24,000 from Avdeevo, just from the excavated part. The construction of the houses made of tusks and mammoth bones sometimes needed a hundred people to be accomplished (Kostienki I complex 2). One can imagine that such long-term occupations asked for a certain investment on the part of a numerous population. It is difficult to say whether those proto-villages were inhabited all year round: judging by the fauna, an occupation in late spring (young mammoths) and in early winter (fur-bearing animals) may be postulated. Those agglomerations were possibly protected by palisades or similar defenses, as is suggested by the suddenness of the outer boundaries. The food of the populations consisted mainly of meat, as may be derived from the many pits dug into the permafrost and destined for the conservation of meat. Hunting techniques, besides mammoth, which was also used as building material and as fuel, wolf and hare were the main game, must necessar- ily differ from those applied in the Pavlovian. In the Don val- ley the landscape is more monotonous: plateaus covered with tundra steppe dominated by Asteraceae and Chicoriaceae , and by trees (pine, birch, alder) in the bottom of the valley (Praslov and Rogatchev 1982; Spiridonova 1991 and 2002). There is no direct evidence for the collecting and consumption of plants. Noteworthy techniques are the weaving of plant fibers and the burning of clay: non-identifiable fragments (figurines?) made of non-local clay mixed with ashes from bones and plants. In the 'artistic' sphere, the female limestone statuette from Kostienki 13, pregnant, in a sitting position (Kelsevska), reminds one also of the 'mother-goddesses' of the Near East Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="9">To be or not to be. . . Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 13 (Praslov and Rogatchev 1982: fig. 45. 4). The other female statuettes of the Kostienkian correspond to the model of the Gravettian 'Venus', if with regional stylistic peculiarities (Gagarino). Small animal statuettes are also known. The large 'proto-villages' of the Kostienkian disappear around 20,000 BP, along with the climatic deterioration of the LGM (OIS 2), however, the lithic techno-morphological tradition persisted in the Russian plain until ca 18,000 BP. By that time the encampments had become short-lived and unstructured. The site of Zaraysk near Vladimir is an excep- tion, between 21,000 and 19,000 BP, particularly in phase 2 of the main level (Amirkhanov et al. 2009): there are two rows of lengthy pit houses, one comprises 5 to 6 pits, the other one 3, separated by a 7 m wide strip along the axis of which five round hearths lay. The installation brings to mind the big com- plexes of Kostienki I and of Avdeevo. Zaraysk has also yielded a great amount of lithic artefacts (about 35,000) and several anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes made of ivory. A further installation, from ca 21,000 BP, has been found in Kostienki IV / Alexandrovka, lower level: an oval of 20 x 7 m with a central row of nine hearths. This level is rather classi- cal Gravettian and differs from the Kostienkian. At the upper level of the same site two round pit houses were located with a diameter of 6 to 8 m, as well as one of the biggest known collections of polished objects, including ax-shaped items (Rogatchev 1955: pl. XV), and grinding material made of sandstone and of quartzite (Rogatchev 1955: pl. XVI-XXI). With leaf-shaped points, the upper level, although chronologi- cally close to the lower one, shows a different aspect of the Gravettian technocomplex. These examples show that possible abortive attempts at neolithization manifest themselves in various features of the middle Upper Paleolithic, although the most complete ensem- ble of innovations belong to the Pavlovian and the Kostienkian. THE SECOND APOGEE: THE POST-GLACIAL EASTERN EPI-GRAVETTIAN (18,000-14,000 BP) The first beginnings of Neolithization appear again after the peak of the Pleniglacial, in particular in the Russian plain, where after 17-18,000 BP the 'cold mammoth steppe' had returned. The phenomenon of sedentism or semi-seden- tism reappears especially in two regions of the Russian plain, namely in the middle Don area around Kostienki and the mid- dle Dniepr area in Ukraine. In both cases, the stability of the habitat is confirmed by large and very elaborate structures set on the ground and built of mammoth bones. In Russia they are known under the name of "habitations of the Anosovka- Mezine type" (Anikovitch et al. 2008). In the former region the Kostienki- Anosovka culture flour- ishes between 17,000 and 14,000 BP. The best example of structures is to be found at Kostienki 11 layer la (Anosovka 2: Praslov and Rogatchev 1982). It is a round structure with a diameter of 9 m, slightly dug in (0.30-0.50 m) and made of mammoth bones. Every sector uses different parts of the skeleton: 14 scapulas in the SE, 17 skulls in the SW and long bones in the N and the NE. Inside, the ground is covered with carbonized bones. The superstructure was made of branches covered with skins and with soil extracted from the previously excavated pit. The structure was surrounded by five pits with a diameter of 1 to 2 m, meant for the storage of meat. Two further structures were found on the same site but were less well preserved. The site Kostienki 2 (Zamiatninskaya, see Praslov and Rogatchev 1982) belongs to the same chronological hori- zon. The structure is similar, with a diameter of 8 m and a lengthy annex, also built of mammoth bones, that has served as burial place for a male in sitting position (Boriskovski 1963; Anikovich et al. 2008). Those structures attest at least to a semi-sedentism under severer conditions than before the peak of the pleniglacial, with very low temperatures, especially in winter. The situation justified a serious architectural effort. Lacking wood in that period animal bones were the only fuel. In the middle Dniepr area the Mezin culture has pro- vided the most complete ensembles of elaborate structures of the same type, as in Mezin, Dobranitchevka and, especially, Mezhirichi. In particular, they featured walls of a consider- able height. In Mezhirichi four circular structures with a diameter of 4 to 6.5 m are surrounded by 7 to 8 circular pits, by hearths and by working areas, for instance for chipping activities (Pidoplitchko 1976; Soffer et al. 1997). The best pre- served construction, structure 1, contained 95 mamooth jaw- bones fixed by long bones stuck into the ground and building the foundation for a dome formed of several skulls, shoulder blades and pelvises. In Mezin, five circular structures with a diameter of 5 to 6 m were surrounded by 2 to 9 pits (meat reserves), by hearths, by accumulations of bones and by areas for domestic activi- ties (Shovkoplyas 1965). Further similar structures are known from other Epi-Gravettian sites in the region (Dobranitchevka, Gontsy). There remains the problem of the occupation's duration and of the contemporaneousness of the structures. O. Soffer (1985: 348) suggests that "all sites in the study area were seasonally Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="10">14 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI occupied and do not represent permanent settlements inhab- ited for years or decades". A peculiarity that Soffer herself has well observed must, however, be underlined: the sites with dwelling-structures and storage-pits (Mezhirichi, Mezin, Gontsy, Dobranitchevka, but also Suponievo and Yudinovo, Epi-Gravettian sites further north than the preceding ones) show indications of occupation in winter as well as in sum- mer, and that is not the case at sites without either structures or pits but showing indications of occupation during the temper- ate seasons. Evidence of occupation during the cold seasons and the temperate seasons is still no proof of a "round year sedentism" (Soffer 1985: 349). Besides evidence of domestic activities above all linked to subsistence economy, the sites occupied in winter attest ritual activities or ceremonies, as is shown by the presence of objects of a non-utilitarian nature (Mezin, Mezhirichi). The contemporaneousness of the particular dwellings remains an open question: some micro-stratigraphic observa- tions in Mezhirichi rather indicate a diachronic occupation. Nevertheless, if the interpretation of an engraving on a bone is correct, it has to be admitted that at least three or four of the structures have existed simultaneously. Among other hints the domestication of the dog at Mezin must be mentioned, which is still being discussed (Polikarpovich 1968; contra Soffer 1985: 201). The artistic representations are characterized by the dis- appearance of realism in favor of schematization. With the exception of the "Venus of Eliseevichi", all anthropomorphic representations after 17,000 BP are schematic, with an indica- tion of the sexual characteristics, for example by simple tri- angles in the pubic region or sometimes the backside. THE END OF THE ICE AGE AND THE RENEWED DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FIRST BEGINNINGS OF NEOLITHIZATION (14,000-10,000 BP) At the end of the Pleistocene, the "mammoth steppe" with its considerable biomass of animals and plants disap- pears, due to of the extinction of the big mammals, including the mammoth. The process began earlier in the west with the Magdalenian, where the reindeer hunt dominates. The seasonal migrations of the reindeer have brought about the mobility of the hunters, who follow them: a development not favorable to a semi-settled way of life and the construction of elaborate habi- tats. Sites of assemblage exist in the Magdalenian, sometimes called "super sites" (Bahn 1982 and 1983; Clottes 1987); they often are caves, meeting-places for groups that have followed the reindeer herds, places where rituals could be celebrated as well. Signs of a first beginning of Neolithization in Late Ice Age Europe are rare: no traces of semi-sedentism nor of significant plant-collecting. This situation does not only prevail in Europe, but in all of Northern Eurasia (Vasil'ev et al. 2003), where the groups of mobile hunters have wandered north in pursuit of the retreating glaciers. Those communities (Hamburgian, Federmesser) are con- sidered to be Paleolithic, partly contemporaneous with the Epi-Gravettian. The most recent ones (Maglemosian) are Mesolithic. They are of interest here because they have devel- oped tools that, in the Near East, are said to belong to the Neolithic package (see below): microlithisation of the elements arming arrowheads; appearance of monolithic arrowheads, which morphologically resemble the types known as Byblos or Amuq points in the Near East; traces of bipolar debitage even boat-shaped (naviform cores). Composite arrows armed with small blades - retouched or not - also appear in the Eastern Epi-Gravettian (Talitski in Russia), as well as in the Russian and Central European Mesolithic. In the Maglemosian there are also axes and adzes as well as animal representations engraved on elk bone or antlers or sculpted in amber. Around the Baltic Sea, the local Mesolithic cultures have fabricated polished axes. All those elements deserved to be mentioned rather as examples of convergence, however, they do not allow to draw any particular conclusion with regard to a parallel development of Eastern Europe and the Near East. The only symptoms of control over the animals might con- sist in a selective hunt according to age and sex. One could add most doubtful arguments in favor of the control of the horse - the elements adduced by Bahn (1978) for the Eastern Pyrenees need further discussion - and of the dog in the Western Magdalenian (Pionnier-Capitan et al. 2011). This is also the case for the red-deer in Mesolithic time in Europe (Jarman 1976). Post-glacial climatic conditions and more temperate inter- ludes like Alleröd modify the way of life: hunting based on seasonal migrations with a logistic mobility adapted to open environments is replaced by a more opportunistic exploitation of a restricted wooded environment with only local mobility, for the exploitation of food resources in the surroundings of the site. This type of subsistence economy prevailing with the post-glacial hunters of the Mesolithic period was not favorable to the beginnings of Neolithization.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 15 THE APPEARANCE OF NEOLITHIZATION IN THE MESOLITHIC OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE (10,000-7000 BP) Contrary to northern Europe where Neolithization is a result of sedentism called forth by an economy orientating itself towards collecting, which replaces hunting especially in coastal areas, Neolithization in Southeastern Europe in the Mesolithic period rather means contact with the already neoli- thized societies of the Near East or with the first farmers in the Balkans. This is a secondary Neolithization. The contact can have been made by sea, for the Aegean islands, or by land, for the Mesolithic of the Iron Gates. THE MESOLITHIC OF THE AEGEAN BASIN (9600-9350 BP) Recent excavations on the Aegean islands, at sites dating to the Early and Middle Holocene, such as Kythnos, Ikaria, Gioura, Naxos, Chalki (Sampson ed. 2008; Sampson et al 2008; Kozlowski and Kaczanowska 2009) have brought to light the existence of particular features, differing from those on the continent and probably constituting a particular adapta- tion to island conditions; it included significant collecting of coastal products and the establishment of a network of mari- time contacts between the islands, as is attested by the circu- lation of obsidian from Melos or Ghiali. The extensive dig at Maroulas on the isle of Kythnos (Sampson et al. 2010) shows stable habitats, with bases of circular constructions associ- ated with several successive pavements. The constructions are contemporary with circular constructions of the Near Eastern PPNA. The datings at Maroulas range from 9600 to 9350 BP. About 30 structures have been excavated, some associated with burials under the pavements or between the pavements. Grinding material has been found as well, including deep mor- tars that show analogies to the Near East. The mortars may have been used to process vegetables, especially those of the Boraginaceae , Portulaceae and Poaceae families. But their state of preservation and the fact that the remains were not burnt made them impossible to date and to associate undoubt- edly with the habitats (Müller-Bieniek 2010). The presence of suids, certainly imported from the continent, confirms on the other hand - and regardless of their probable semi-domestic state - the beginnings of Neolithization (Trantalidou 2010). The Mesolithic levels of the cave of the Cyclops on the isle of Gioura have even yielded semi-domestic caprids (Sampson et al 2008). Those indications of a Neolithization on the Aegean islands do not derive from a local development but from maritime con- tacts with the Eastern Mediterranean since the PPNA. Traces of the Pre-Neolithic in the early phase of the lithic industry of Cyprus (contacts with the Syro-Palestinian coast) at the same time as techno-morphologic elements harking back to the Aegean Mesolithic (Ammerman 2010; Ammerman et al 2007 and 2008), allow to put forward the hypothesis of maritime contacts between Cyprus and the Aegean. Those contacts have led to the appearance of the elements of the Neolithic pack- age in the Mesolithic of the islands since its early phase. The ultimate phase of the process is represented by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic of Crete. At the bottom of the sequence in Knossos the traditions of the Aegean Mesolithic are to be found with, in addition, the full package , especially in the domain of economy, of Pre-Pottery Neolithic (Kozlowski and Kaczanowska 2009). THE MESOLITHIC AT THE IRON GATES (AROUND 7000 BP) At the Iron Gates (Romania, Serbia) the Mesolithic is known as the 'culture of Lepinski Vir'. It shows well the social and economic adaptation of the inhabitants of the Danube gorges to the changed conditions. In the early phase, the groups remain isolated in that zone, which is characterized by impres- sive geographic features. They adapt a 'Paleolithic' economy to the changes at the beginning Holocene by an increasing exploitation of the water, especially by catching migratory fish, above all salmonoids. The abundance of food - if only seasonal - and the possibility of storing smoked fish permit a certain stability of the habitat, a fact apparent in the erection of permanent stone structures. In the later phase, a growing stability becomes apparent in half dug-in trapezoid structures along with associated buri- als. The main diet of the occupants remains fish, as is shown by the analysis of the faunai remains and of the stable iso- topes (Bonsall et al. 1997). At the same time it is interesting to notice that, in Lepinski Vir and probably also in Padina, the trapezoid houses do not only yield Neolithic sherds (Jovanovič 1967; Garaçanin and Radovanovič 2001), but also tools made of 'Balkan' flint, typical of the early Neolithic in the Balkano- Danubian zone - as are polished axes (Boriò 2002). The hypothesis has been advanced on the fact that the inhabitants of Lepinski Vir were surrounded by Neolithic groups and that their architecture results from the contact with those groups (Jovanovič 1967). However, the AMS dates of Lepinski Vir and Padina - contrary to the old dates published by D. Srejoviò Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="12">16 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZtOWSKI and S.K. KOZtOWSKI (1969) - lie before the Neolithization of that zone (Boric 2002 and 2008; Whittle et al. 2002). The problem of the 'Neolithization' of the Lepinski Vir cul- ture is far from being solved, the more so that the houses do not contain any remains of domestic animals and that there are no equivalents to trapezoid structures in the Balkano-Danubian Neolithic. Neither does the artistic voice of the inhabitants - with numerous motifs that have been interpreted as symbols for water and with anthropomorphic heads featuring 'fish- mouths' - have an analogy in the Neolithic of Southeastern Europe. It is still possible that certain signs of a beginning Neolithization do not result from exchanges between Mesolithic fishermen/hunters and Neolithic farmers - even if the ceramics and the Balkan flint are evidence in favor of contact between the two populations. All this asks for a réévaluation of the sequence of Lepinski Vir phases I-III as proposed by Srejovič and for- merly accepted by Kozlowski and Kozlowski (1984). CONCLUSION The first trace of a beginning Neolithization to arise among the forager populations of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe is the creation of permanent habitats and the appearance of sed- entary or semi-sedentary ways of life. The settling process becomes possible through environments rich in animal as well as vegetal biomass. The best example of this type of environ- ment was the cold steppe appearing towards the close of the Interpleniglacial in the middle latitudes of Europe and known as the 'mammoth steppe'. The first beginnings of Neolithization among the pre-Pleni- glacial groups especially in Central and Eastern Europe, in the domains of material culture and social organization (organi- zation of encampments comparable to proto-villages, burials in the vicinity of the habitats, production of heavy tools, the polishing technique, burning of clay) as well as in the produc- tion of symbolic objects (the female figurines or 'Venus') have been made possible by permanent habitats and by a sedentary or semi-sedentary way of life. The apogee of those innovations lies just before the climatic decline connected with the isotopie stage OIS2, which forced the populations with microlithic industries to leave the 'mam- moth steppe' turned into tundra or even into a polar desert. The new environment heightens the mobility of the hunters, who must adapt to more limited food resources and to migratory game like the reindeer. Some of those innovations reappear after the Glacial Maximum of the OIS2 stage, especially in Eastern Europe where Pre-Pleniglacial populations of the Gravettian tradition have found refuge. The first beginnings of Neolithization appear, indeed, later in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East than in Central and Eastern Europe, namely in the Late Ice Age (Tardiglaciaire). Although more recent, the beginnings in the Near East are manifest in innovations similar to those of the OIS3 stage in Europe, and they are also linked to a sedentary way of life (see below). In the Near East the climatic decline at the end of the Late Ice Age (Dryas III) had no such heavy con- sequences for the Epi-Paleolithic populations as did the peak of the Pleniglacial in Europe. The rapid arrival of the climatic optimum in the postglacial period allowed these populations to develop new economic bases by the domestication of plants and animals. THE NEAR EAST (35,000-8000 BP) THE AURIGNACIAN OF THE LEVANT (35,000-20,000 BP) Other than the preceding (Mousterian) and following (Kebaran) cultures, the Aurignacian of the Levant is not known well at the present stage of research (see the last réévaluation of the Aurignacian levels of Ksar Akil, Lebanon, by Williams and Bergman 2010). The sites, most often caves but also open- air sites, show no traces of a habitat, except hearths (Goring- Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2003). Human remains were found far apart and do not assemble to real burials. The only feature to hold one's attention is the find of a few heavy tools, grinding-stones and handstones, some with traces of ochre. As no vegetable remains are preserved - with the exception of carbonized wood from the pistachio tree, the oak and the olive-tree - we do not know which kinds of food were eventu- ally treated with the help of that material. Only by examin- ing the flora of the present may we gain an idea of the plants that were eatable. The faunai finds resemble the fauna of later periods: fallow deer, gazelles, wild cattle, mouflons, lizards, turtles and mollusks (see in Gilead 1995). Contrary to Europe, this culture does not seem to be a 'can- didate' for the beginnings of Neolithization.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 17 Fig. 3 - Climatic curve for Near East between 16,000 and 6000 BP with position of archaeological cultures (from Sanlaville 1996). KEBARAN (20,000-14,500 BP) AND GEOMETRIC KEBARAN (14,500-12,500 BP) The first combinations characteristic of the Neolithic 'pan- oply' appear later than in Europe. The Kebaran falls into a very cold and dry period towards the end of the Pleistocene, with recurring humid phases and a global sea level 100 to 120 m below the present one (fig. 3). Towards 15,000 BP the climate begins to become warmer again, and more humid than today; it stays this way throughout the geometric Kebaran. Between 13,000 and 12,000 BP, it is followed by another cold and dry period, but definitely not as severe as the preceding spell (Sanlaville 1996 and 1997). Kebaran The respective sites are few but significant. It is difficult to maintain that they are evidence of total and permanent sed- entarization, but they are certainly places of a periodic and repeated return: something new for open-air sites in the Near East. The most characteristic site is Ohalo II, in the Jordan valley on the shores of Lake Huleh, with an 'encampment' comprising six 'huts' shaped like oval or almost oval pits, 4 to 5 m long in the major axis and 20 to 30 cm deep. They were covered with plant materials stemming from Tamarix , Salix and QuercuSy as is shown by the carbonized remains found at the periphery of one of the huts. The ground was covered with remains of carbonized acorns, and a basalt grinding-stone was found there as well (Nadel and Werker 1999). In the west and in the south lay six outside hearths, in the east there was a large dump. East of the first zone, later occupation is attested by a circular hut. One complete and three partial burials are associ- ated with this habitat. Ein Gev I, another open-air site, has yielded the oval 'bot- tom of a huť: standing isolated, it has been dug six times at the same place; with an original depth of 40 cm and a diameter of ca 6 m, the dimensions of those shelters shrank to the degree that their levels rose. The floors had a layer of pebbles, and the walls of the pit were upheld by rows of superimposed stones. In level 4, a big stone mortar, 30 cm deep and 20 cm wide, lay upside down next to the inside hearth. Above, in level 3, a burial had been entrenched (Bar Yosef 1970). Jiita II, in Lebanon, is another example: there, a large hut is dug next to the wall of a rock-shelter: it is 6 to 7 m long, 2 m wide and 0.40 m to 1 m deep, and has also gone through sev- eral stages. Above ground, the walls of the pit were continued by a little stone wall stabilized with clay mortar. On the inner side of the wall two post-holes with wedge-stones were found. In the course of three successive occupations the hearths inside were situated at different places (Melki 2004). Apart from the Mediterranean coast and the Jordan val- ley a more desert-like facies is present in the south, such as the Nizzanian (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1997). More than 18% of the known sites provide heavy tools, mainly mor- tars (Wright 1993). As far as the diet is concerned, Ohalo II is the best docu- mented site. The most important collected resources are wild cereals (emmer, T. dicoccoides , and barley, Hordeum sp.), Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="14">18 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI leguminous plants {Lens sp.) harvested from May to June, and acorns gathered from October to March; there were also figs, pistachios and almonds. Their strong correlation in several contemporary pollen diagrams confirms the associations of those species (Bottema 1992). The Kebarans' choice of which plants to collect has an equivalent among present hunter-gatherers populations in a different climatic context: in Africa groups were observed to know and identify between 200 and 250 plants, they know that 50 to 80 are eatable but, as a rule, consume just about ten. And the preferred plants are not the same from one group to the next (Bahuchet 1997). The major hunted species were gazelles and 'small game' (hares and foxes): the former provided almost a third of the bone finds, the latter more than 70%. Migratory birds and fish (carps, minnows) completed the usual diet. The great amount of rodents in hut 1 - less elsewhere - may have been attracted by stored food. Together, the indications point toward an open forest of oaks, pistachio and almond trees, a good location for wild cereals (Nadel ed. 2002). The Kebarans ate a balanced diet: the acorns gave them lipids, carbohydrates and fibers, the cereals and the legumi- nous plants added proteins. All those products had the advan- tage that they could be stored. As observed by ethnographists in California and in Iran, the treatment of acorns comprises several stages: dried and boiled, they are crunched prefer- ably in stone mortars, but also by grinding-stones and hand- stones (Aurenche 1997). In wooden mortars the cereals are first of all husked before they are crunched by grinding-stones (Olszewski 2004). Experiments have shown that husking on grinding-stone after parching is less effective than husking in a wooden mortar (Meurers-Balke and Lüning 1992). The treatment by hunter-gatherers of meat as food has been observed among two populations in British Columbia: the slaughtered game is disemboweled and the entrails are eaten on the spot. The brain is saved, and the bones are broken in order to extract the marrow, only the metapodials are made into tools. For preservation, the meat and the fish are put to dry (Beyries 1997). The lithic industry is mainly characterized by a significant augmentation of microliths, which existed already in the pre- ceding Aurignacian sequence in the Levant. The bladelets are narrow and thin, sometimes curved. They are used as they are or they are retouched or truncated. Later, fine inverse retouches become more frequent (Goring-Morris 1995). Supposedly, some of those products were provided with handles and used either for cutting (knives) or for piercing (arrows). Do those lithic - mainly microlithic - industries exist as a consequence of the use of the bow, which would then have made its appear- ance in the Near East, with consequences for the kinds of ani- mals that could be hunted? Geometric Kebaran Most of the sites have only been surveyed, soundings are very rare - an explanation for the number of open-air sites with traces of habitats remaining about the same as in the Kebaran. The size and the construction techniques of the habi- tats remain the same, too: oval or circular dug-in pits, with or without a border of stones. Usually, the occupied sites lie in valleys (Ein Gev III; Martin 1979), but further east, some are known to be situated at the edge of - today - dry zones, for example Kharaneh IV in Jordan, where a series of post-holes was found (Muhesen 1988; Maher et al. 2012), or in the oasis at Umm el Tlel 2 in Syria, where a basin of 5 x 2.6 m contained a hearth (Molist et Cauvin 1990). The few traces of occupation that were found are badly documented, but the places seem to have been less 'permanent' or less recurrently occupied than those of the Kebaran, an observation perhaps indicating a return to more mobility. However, on 16% of the cataloged sites heavy stone indus- try (limestone or basalt mortars with pestles, grinding-stones with handstones) was found (Wright 1993). Associated burials are rare (Kharaneh, Neve David: Kaufman 1987). The facies appearing in the south (Negev, Sinai) is called Mushabian, which evolves in its turn into Ramonian (Goring- Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1997). Essentially, the geometric Kebaran is distinguished from the Kebaran by the proportion of microliths in geometric shapes, trapezes, rectangles and triangles. In the Kebaran non-geometrical microliths make up more than 50%, in the geometric Kebaran the proportion is turned around to 20% against 60% of geometric microliths, as may be observed at Neve David as well as at Kharaneh IV. NATUFIAN-ZARZIAN-TRIALETIAN (12,500-10,300 BP) This phase coincides with a climatic amelioration (Alleröd) following upon a cold period. From 10,800 BP it is terminated by a sudden return of coldness and aridity, much more pronounced than in the preceding recurrence. Continuing for about a thousand years, that period cor- responds to the Dryas III. The discussion goes on whether its impact in Europe was as strong as in the Near East.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 19 effects were less intense in the Northern than in the Southern Levant (Sanlaville 1997). Occupied open-air sites multiply, but that does not mean that the habitats in caves are abandoned (El Wad, Hayonim Cave). The construction principles remain the same as in the two preceding periods, several kinds of circular or oval pits are known: small pits (ca 1 m in diameter), inside or outside, are generally interpreted as silos (Bartl 2004), "medium" (2.50- 3.5 m) or "large" (more than 8 m, up to 14 m at Wadi Hammeh) pits are considered as habitats. Some authors confer to the lat- ter (such as Mallaha, Wadi Hammeh, Hallan Çemi) a particu- lar status (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2003). Given the small extent of excavated areas and the difficulty of comparing several structures of differing sizes within the same site, this hypothesis needs yet to be confirmed. The walls of the dwelling-pits are either left raw or, more seldom, they are covered with lime as at Mallaha (Valla 2008) - a technique definitely presupposing the mastery of pyrotechnology - , most often, they are coated with sev- eral courses of stone. The superstructures were supported by wooden posts the traces of which, with post-holes and wedge-stones, are still visible (Abu Hureyra, Mallaha, Wadi Hammeh), but were they made of plant material, of hides, pos- sibly of mud (wattle and daub technique)? Such installations are frequent in the Natufian, especially in the Southern Levant, but in the Northern Levant they are also attested in the Zarzian (Zawi Chemi Shanidar) and the Trialetian (Hallan Çemi). The structures are grouped in different ways: sometimes, medium-sized units agglutinate (Hayonim terrace, Rosh Zin). Most often they are free standing and aligned on terraces at several levels. This arrangement on the slope along the con- tours is made possible by the technique of preliminary partial digging operation into the slope. Habitats are centered around caves and terraces in front of caves, in the south (Hayonim, Shuqbah) as well as in the north, in the Zagros (Shanidar, Zarzi). However, a certain tendency becomes apparent: after occupation by the living, the caves tend to be reserved for the dead (Hayonim Cave, El Wad, Shuqbah, Shanidar), while the dwelling-place is moved to the terraces in front of or near the caves. In the Near East, it is most often the Natufian that brings to the forefront the question of the seden- tism (see the discussion below). During the Kebaran, burials were few and far apart, now they come in dozens: at Shuqbah, eight; Hayonim, more than ten; Kebarah, seventeen; Nahal Oren, about fifty; Mallaha and El Wad, more than one hundred (Weinstein-Evron 2009). Surely, this increase is the result of a demographic development, but it expresses also the will to con- centrate the memory of the family or of the community at spe- cific places, which thus are turned into fixed points of reference. The burials are individual or collective, often grouped in sectors: at Mallaha, in the Early Natufian, they "are assembled in three groups that coincide with the locations of the shelters" (Valla 2008). At that site, just as at Hayonim Cave, several individu- als were buried together with - presumably domestic - dogs: at Mallaha, an elderly woman with a young dog; at Hayonim, two individuals with two dogs, a skull and horns of gazelles. Some skeletons did not have skulls (Hayonim Cave, El Wad). At Erq el Ahmar and Mallaha, skulls were found without the bodies. Human representations are the exception. Three schematic but recognizable ones are known: the famous statuette from Ain Sakhri interpreted as a scene of copulation, a small head coming from El Wad and a small damaged bust from Mallaha (Cauvin 1978). The number of animal representations is hardly larger: heads of small ruminants on bone handles and the statuette without head of a small ruminant lying down. More than 49% of the sites present a heavy stone indus- try, either in the habitat or associated with the burials (Nahal Oren, Hayonim Cave, El Wad, Wadi Hammeh). Mortars are preferred (76% to 78% of the retrieved inventories), they can be 50 to 60 cm deep. The so-called 'stone' pipes have no bot- tom (a result of wear?). They are made of basalt or of limestone and often found far away from the places of fabrication, or at least far away from the locations of the primary material. The respective pestles are cylindrical or have an especially broad base. There are also finds of flat grinding-stones and handstones (18%), but it is impossible to determine exactly their function. The tools were found inside the habitats near the hearths, at Wadi Hammeh even in two 'caches'. Sometimes, the mortars are decorated with "carved meander designs and animal heads" (Wright 2000). In the Late Natufian the percentage of grinding- stones rises (39%), that of mortars falls. In that phase, espe- cially in the Harifian, the 'desert' variant of the Late Natufian, the number of 'bedrock mortars' increases: they appear as series of cupules dug into the virgin rock, inside as well as out- side of the habitats (Wright 1993). Generally, mortars bring to mind fruits with a hard shell (acorns, pistachios, almonds) or cereals with husks that must be stripped off before getting at the grain. One could also imag- ine the grinding of meat products. The presence of stone mor- tars does not exclude that, for the husking of cereals, wooden mortars or pestles were preferred, as the ethnographic examples have already shown. The flat grinding-stones would rather serve to crush grains after the husking in order to make flour or grits. The lithic industries are still characterized by microli- thization, with shapes differing from those of the preceding Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="16">20 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZtOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI cultures: Natufian and Zarzian, for example, are known for tri- angles and for 'crescents' (segments of circles), which, in time, grow ever smaller. In the Trialetian, the geometric elements are larger and thicker. To the assemblage must be added plain blades the cutting edge of which shows a brilliant sheen caused by repeated contact with plants that are rich in silica (reaping- knives), and macrolithic tools of a shape suggesting that they were provided with a handle, like adzes. Tools made of bone showing a straight slot are interpreted as handles. There are pebbles with a wide groove, rounded in profile, on one of their sides. These 'shaft straighteners' are generally regarded as tools used to straighten or polish the shafts of arrows. They will also appear in the following periods. The major part of supplies is still gained by hunting and gathering. A study covering several Natufian sites in the Levant shows that the proportion between 'big' game and 'small' game has developed over time: 'small' game has grown from 8% in the Paleolithic period to 37% in the Kebaran and to 63% in the Natufian (Munro 2004). 'Big' game comprises seven spe- cies: gazelle (Gazella gazella), fallow deer ( Dama mesopota- mica :), wild pig ( Sus scrofa), aurochs (Bos primigenius), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe-deer (Capreolus capreolus), and two Equidae (Equus hemionus and Equus caballus). There are definite preferences in the choice of the species to be hunted: at Hayonim Cave, for example, gazelles alone make up 88% of the 'big' game. The other species appear to a much lesser degree, namely between 1 and 3%. Also this proportion has varied over time: in the Kebaran, gazelles made up only 67% (Munro 2004). There is larger diversity in the Zagros. In several cases, the Ovicaprinae and the Cervidae are in the majority. 'Small' game was hunted, 'quick' (hares, foxes, partridges) as well as 'slow' game (turtles, mollusks) and a great variety of birds. Also here is evolution: while already significant in the Paleolithic (54% of the 'small game'), the hunt after turtles attains its maximum in the Kebaran (83%), falls to 36% in the early Natufian, when hare and partridge are in higher demand. At the end of the Natufian the tendency is turned around again with the percentage of turtles rising to 73% (Munro 2004). Birds are another prey must appreciated: in the Paleolithic they make up 43% of the small game, in the Early Natufian only 33%, but 20% of the total fauna against 8% in the Paleolithic (Munro 2004). Birds of prey are the majority in the Paleolithic. They are not necessarily hunted for food but for their feathers and bones. In the Natufian, partridges are in the majority, but birds of prey are also present. Might it not be possible that some of them were trained for hunting (Dobney 2002)? Whenever the environment was favorable (riverbanks or lake shores), a great amount of fishing took place. As dogs were found in some burials, the hypothesis arose - based rather on 'psychological' than on 'morphological' arguments - that the dog was domesticated in the Natufian. It should then be remembered that also remains of gazelles were found in the tombs. . . If the domestication of the dog was proven, would that also mean that, perhaps, the dog was not just a 'companion' but also a help in hunting (contra, Ronen 2004, see below)? The same plants were collected as in the Kebaran. To the former list chick pea (Vicia sp.) may be added. In the Northern Levant another variety of wheat, (T. boeticum), as well as rye (Secale sp.) became interesting. But one must be careful not to falsify the perspective: it is always the same small number of cereals and leguminous plants that are looked at because they are the ancestors of those that will later be domesticated. In reality and in quantity there exists a much larger variety of other eatable graminaceous plants (Stipa sp.), polygonaceae (Polygonum sp.) or cyperaceae (Bolboschoenus maritimus). Concerning the last plant, experiments in collecting have been conducted in Great Britain and in Tbrkey, and were found to be "profitable" (Wollstonecroft 2009). Towards the end of the Natufian those plants are especially well represented in the fioodplain of the Euphrates (Savard et al 2006; Willcox 2008). At Abu Hureyra, one counts more than 120 species of grain-bearing plants and more than 250 species of plants in general, 157 can be eaten. The proposed domestication of rye has come under debate (Hillman 2000). Another resource ought to be added: it is often underestimated because, other than the graminaceous plants, it leaves few traces; the acorn, which far from being a kind of supplementary food, perhaps able to alleviate a time of famine, constituted an important part of the diet. A "profitability" count - if, in prehistory, that concept makes sense at all - shows that, in calories collected per hour, acorns are at 800 (for the smallest) to 1350 (for the biggest) calories/hour, while einkorn attains 1230, emmer 988 and barley 871 (Olszewski 2004). PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC A (PPNA) 10,200-9500 BP - EARLY PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC B (EARLY PPNB) 9500-9200B 1 Just as the Natufian had profited from the warmer periods Bölling and Alleröd, the beginning of the PPNA coincides 1. The concepts of PPNA and PPNB are taken in their chronological mean- ing. In the Northern as well as in the Southern Levant they comprise numerous local contemporary cultures (Kozlowski and Aurenche 2005).

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 21 with the arrival of the Preboreal period (Byrd 2005). It sets in before the close of the Dryas III, but benefits from a rapid climatic amelioration that will culminate in the middle PPNB before the appearance of a short dry phase from 8000 BP, with an amplitude equivalent to half the amplitude of the Late Dryas. The amelioration seems to have occurred more rapid in the Northern than in the Southern Levant (Sanlaville 1997). The shapes of the habitats inherited from the preceding period are kept, with a tendency to occupy larger surfaces. The biggest sites (Jericho, Mureybet) reach 2 to 3 hectares. A kind of hierarchy establishes itself: besides the largest villages that are regularly situated in the valleys of the biggest rivers (Jordan, Euphrates, Tigris), smaller villages have a size com- parable to that of the agglomerations in the preceding period (0.3-0.5 ha). The building principles remain the same: preparatory pit and circular ground-plan. The building materials are the same, namely stone, earth and wood; the size of the habitations, 3 to 9 m in diameter, most often consisting of just one cell, is comparable. Besides cob (piled-up humid earth), prefabricated molded elements begin to appear (mud bricks), for instance in Jericho, M'lefaat or Nemrik. In the Northern Levant the posts supporting the structures are 'duplicated' or replaced by pillars of stones and earth (Mureybet, Qermez Dere, Nemrik). Major innovations make their appearance. Sometimes two circular, communicating cells are juxtaposed (Jericho, Jerf el Ahmar). In particular, the excavation is substituted by the erection of rising walls, actually the beginnings of real 'construction', in the etymological sense of the term, of walls set on the ground, a development which brings about a rapid modification of the traditional plans: soon they become sub- rectangular, then rectangular, thus allowing a multiplication of adjoining cells, something more difficult to do with circular cells. Two perpendicular walls must be joined, a feat demand- ing the mastery of real techniques in masonry. They were not achieved at once: the first rectangular cells have rounded angles. The different stages can be best observed in the differ- ent occupation phases of the village Jerf el Ahmar (Stordeur 1999). On that site, as well as on others, a diversification of the constructions takes place; beside ca ten small-sized 'ordinary' houses - first circular, then rectangular and built at ground- level - there appears a 'unique' structure, 6 to 8 m in diameter and built in the old fashion: circular and sunk into the ground; its exact function is not ascertained. As far as can be judged it is located sometimes in the center, sometimes on the periph- ery. It is provided with benches and with several cells sepa- rated by low walls. The cells may have been used for storage (Mureybet, Jerf el Ahmar). The access was from the roof via a platform resting on two supporting walls from where one climbed down over wooden stairs (Aurenche 2006a). Regarded as 'community houses', they are compared to the kivas of the pueblos of Central America (Stordeur et al 2000). This type of installation may be found on several sites of the Euphrates valley (Mureybet, Jerf el Ahmar, Tel 'Abr, Dja'de). They show painted decoration, as in Dja'de, or sculpted stone slabs lining the edge of the benches, or monolithic pillars (Jerf el Ahmar, Tel 'Abr). In the Southern Levant, in Jericho, there exists a different version: a massive stone tower with stairs inside that lead up to a platform at the top. It is associated with a mighty retaining wall (Aurenche 2006b). At the present stage of research, with an insufficient extent of excavation on the sites, Banning's hypothesis that they were "simple" houses (Banning 2011) remains to be proven. At the different sites, the change from circular to rectangu- lar plan is either gradual, as on the Euphrates, where it seems to have happened first, then at Nemrik in the east and at Beidha in the south, or sudden (after a short abandonment of the site?), as in Jericho or Çayônû. On the latter site, architectural mas- tery of the construction of rectangular buildings is especially well developed: the floors inside the houses rest on a socle con- sisting, first, of a net of parallel walls very close to each other ( grill plan) and, later, of rows of small square cells (with a length of 1 m and a height of 1 m) (cell plan). Some of the cells were used as silos (Cafer Höyük). Access was possible via stairs on the outside. The second technique (convergence or influence?) also exists in the Southern Levant at Beidha (Byrd 1994). The tradition of community buildings is continued, but even if they become rectangular, they are still sunk in the ground (Çayônû, Nevali Çori). The site of Göbekli comes to mind, with its succession of, exclusively, community buildings: the oldest have a circular ground-plan, the youngest a rectangular one. Their coverings rested on an impressive series of mono- lithic pillars sculpted with animals in low and high relief. The excavations have, till yet, not brought to light any correspond- ing habitat. Contra , the last interpretation by Banning (2011) needs confirmation. There are less burials than in the Natufian, especially if seen in proportion with the size of the PPNA villages. But as very few sites of that period are completely excavated, there remains the possibility that the burials were grouped at places close to the habitat, as for instance at Nemrik in the Iraqian Jezirah (Kozlowski 2002). When the burials are within the habitat, they may be outside as well as inside the houses. The Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="18">22 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI main innovation consists in the separation of the skulls that are then reassembled in groups in a sort of depot (Jericho, Mureybet, Jerf el Ahmar, Qermez Dere). The amount of human representations is rising. From the Southern Levant a series of homogeneous female statuettes is known: very schematic but with a well-defined sexual organ. The representations in Mureybet are less schematic: a clay figurine, without head, and a limestone statuette, both folding their arms under the breasts - an attitude that appears like the archetype of a later tradition spread all over the Near East. In the Northern Levant (Nemrik) human heads are sculpted at the top of cylindrical shafts (pestles?). There are practically no animal figurines at all. At Mureybet, a limestone statuette considered human at the time it was uncovered was later on identified by an archaeozoologist as a "nocturnal bird of prey", then again as human by another archaeozoologist (Stordeur et Lebreton 2008). These hesita- tions point to 'hybrids' invention, that will be found in the fol- lowing period. There is a change in the heavy tools industry: the big Natufian stone mortars disappear and make room for flat grinding-stones. The remaining mortars are much smaller. A new model appears, the grinding-stone-mortar, a flat grinding- stone the central part of which shows one or several cavities. They are found associated with the so called "plats à cupules": round stone dishes, carefully polished and elaborately made, with a marked edge. Those dishes are provided with several cavities, mostly at the rim, not very deep and a few centimeters wide ("cupules": Nierlé 2008). Inside the habitat, the grinding- stones are often let into the floor or into raised benches (Jerf el Ahmar). In the Levant, 71% of the known sites and 81% of the excavated sites have heavy stone industry, and the proportion of grinding-stones and mortars is turned around: 64% of the sites prefer grinding-stones against 59% for mortars, including bedrock mortars (Wright 1993). The technique of polishing is also applied to another cat- egory of objects: the chipped adze that had appeared in the Natufian are gradually replaced - probably for the same kind of work, namely to handle wood and soft stone - by blades of polished celts made from hard stone, which take more time to make (shaping, pecking, polishing) but which live longer. The 'polished ax' or celt, used to be regarded as one of the main signs of Neolithization, today is just one tool among many . . . The lithic industry undergoes a change as well: microliths at the end of arrows are gradually replaced by monolithic arrowheads - one arrowhead per arrow - , first small then ever bigger, due to a new technique, that of bipolar debitage (Cauvin et al. 2008). Mureybet, one of the few sites where the passage from Natufian to PPNA, then to PPNB can be followed in the stratigraphy, is also a good place to observe those changes of techniques. It is also a good place to observe the evolution of subsis- tence strategies. Several tendencies are to be noted in hunt- ing practices: there is a global decline in the hunting of 'small game', essentially hares, which passes from 18% at the begin- ning of occupation to 5% at the close of the PPNA. The gazelle is still the mainly hunted species: from 49% in the Natufian, it rises to 70% in the Khiamian (first phase of the PPNA), before it gradually diminishes down to 22% at the close of the PPNA and disappears almost completely in the early PPNB. The sec- ond hunted species are the Equidae: 23% in the Natufian, 57% in the PPNA and still 44% in the Early PPNB. Gazelles and Equidae were hunted in a collective surround in the course of which the animals were killed regardless of age or sex. The aurochs becomes the 'fashionable animal': from 14% in the PPNA its percentage rises to 26% in the Middle PPNB (Gourichon et Helmer 2008). It seems as if the hunt aimed at more 'profitable' species in terms of biomass. But judging from the attention given to bucrania, in Mureybet, where they are buried in benches made of mud, as well as in Jerf el Ahmar, where they were hung on the walls like trophies, meat and marrow were perhaps not the only attraction. The preserved memory of the accomplished feat may also have been a motivation. Actually, already in the late 1970s, P. Ducos postulated a kind of population control of the aurochs and introduced the concept of "proto-raising" (Ducos 1978). As far as plant food is concerned, like in Natufian site of Abu Hureyra, a place in the same ecological zone as Mureybet, namely at the border of the steppe and the riparian forests on the banks of the Euphrates, the consumption of acorns, pista- chios and - at Jerf el Ahmar - almonds continues. The dimin- ishing collection of species like Stipa and Polygonum goes hand in hand with a rise in barley ( Hordeum spontaneum ), rye (Secale sp.), difficult to distinguish from einkorn (T. boeti- cum), and leguminous plants (Lens sp.). As those latter species belong to a group of plants that will soon be domesticated and as the natural habitat where rye and einkorn could have been collected is 60 to 75 km away from the site, the hypothesis has been put forth that the grains were planted right there so that they would be closer to the place of consumption. Another indication is the presence of non-eatable adventitious plants appearing on 'cultivated' ground, where the soil has been bro- ken up before sowing. Those plants are harvested along with the cereals (Willcox 2012). This is the famous "pre-domestic agriculture" proposed by J. Cauvin (2000).

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 23 But the end of the Dryas III, which coincides with the begin- nings of the PPNA, was certainly not the best season to make successful agricultural experiments. Contrary to the argu- ments brought forth by the determinists, one cannot consider that phase of climatic worsening as stimulus for the 'inven- tion' of agriculture in order to maintain oneself in that time of supposed penury. It seems on the contrary that the Dryas III hindered the first agricultural experiments from arriving more quickly at a morphological domestication of cereals. In that sense one could introduce the notion of an "abortive or 'failed' Neolithization" (see below). For, in fact, no domestication has been morphologically determined in Mureybet (Willcox 2008). Reviewing the vegetable supplies at all sites of the period, regional specialities can be pointed out: of wild cereals, there are barley (H. spontaneum) and emmer (71 dicoccoides) in the Southern Levant (Gilgal), barley and einkorn/rye (T. boe- ticum thaoudar/Secale sp.) on the middle Euphrates and in Iraq, barley, emmer, einkorn and rye in Southeast Anatolia. In the eastern wing of the Fertile Crescent lentils are more often eaten than cereals (Charles 2007). With the exception of rye, all those species are also present in Cyprus (Willcox 2005 and 2012). The facts are important for determining the place where each of the species will be domesticated. The valleys of the Upper Tigris and Upper Euphrates seem to be among the regions where the acknowledged domestica- tion of einkorn and emmer happened first, namely since the Early PPNB. Domesticated barley did not appear before the Middle PPNB. Meanwhile, also leguminous plants ( Lens sp.) are considered to have been 'cultivated' without any percep- tible morphological change, in the Northern (Jerf el Ahmar) as well as the Southern Levant (Netiv Hagdud). It is even sup- posed that the manipulations were not restricted to the annual plants: it is maintained that, at Gilgal, a rare variety of a fig- tree has been selected (references in Zeder 2011b). MIDDLE PPNB (9200-8500 BP) - LATE PPNB (8500-8000 BP) In this period the process of neolithization comes to a close with the appearance of the first vegetable and animal species that are morphologically domestic. From then on the habitat is rectangular throughout. Two elements are kept: the construction techniques and the orga- nization of space. The dwellings are either set on the ground or raised on a stone socle at least part of which was used for storage (see above). Because of the quantity of material needed for the rising walls the prefabricated elements (mud bricks) are even more systematically molded. The floors are covered with lime or with plaster (Southern Levant), in layers that were several times renewed - work demanding a good mastery of pyrotechnology. The dimensions of the interior increase. It consists either of one or two cells or, most often, of three arranged behind each other. The tradition of the "community buildings" con- tinued (Çayônû, Nevali Çori, Göbekli, A§ikli), especially in the Northern Levant. In the Southern Levant, structures that are interpreted as community buildings (Jericho, Beidha, 'Ain Ghazal) need further confirmation. Towards the close of the period, the sites may attain a size of about ten hectares, a big jump in quantity compared to the preceding period. In some cases (Çayônû, Dja'de) those buildings also harbor "houses of the dead", where dozens or hundreds of skeletons in secondary position and separated skulls are concentrated. With the community building at the edge of the agglomera- tion (Nevali Çori, Çayônû, Beidha?), the collective organiza- tion appears to be rather loose. Several villages are surrounded with walls that probably fulfill the double function of defense walls and retaining walls (Nevali Çori (?), Maghzalia, Halula, A§ikli in the north, Beidha, Jericho in the south, Khirokitia, Kalavassos-Tenta in Cyprus) (Bader and Aurenche 2009). In the Southern Levant, some human skulls undergo a special treatment: they are not buried, strictly speaking, but gathered in depots that are either put on the floor or interred. After removal of the flesh, the faces are formed over in lime or in plaster, stones or shells are put in the orbits in place of the eyes (Stordeur et Khawam 2006). The debate about their meaning goes on: are they the skulls of ancestors figuring in a cult (Cauvin J. 2000), or are they trophies taken from enemies (Testart 2008)? As far as human representations are concerned, the period witnesses a considerable jump in quantity: the figurines (ani- mals and 'sitting ladies'), now most often made of clay, multi- ply, and, for the first time, real statues appear, almost life-sized, sometimes even larger. In the Southern Levant, they are mod- elled in lime over an armature made of rushes ('Ain Ghazal, Jericho). There are complete statues, ca 1 m high, there are also busts, some double-headed. Men as well as women are represented (Rollefson 1983 and 1986; Rollefson et al 1992; Thbb 1985). In the Northern Levant, the statues are made of stone in full relief (Nevali Çori, Göbekli). There are separate life-sized human heads, and stylized human silhouettes in low-relief on monolithic pillars more than 2 m high, veritable Atlases, and even a 'totem' composed of birds and a female head (Hauptmann 2009; Hauptmann und Schmidt 2007).

KOZLOWSKI At Göbekli, those pillars were found in great numbers in the community buildings; they are decorated with animals in low- and even in high relief. Animal figurines are popping up almost everywhere. The represented species are not always the same on sculpted pillars and as figurines. Also does neither reflect systematically the hunted fauna or the species about to be domesticated. Among the sculpted or engraved animals are only two car- nivores (one is the panther), four ruminants, one suid, three birds and many representations of snakes; among the hunted animals are at least fifteen carnivores, four Equidae, ten Bovidae (one is the gazelle) and one specimen of Lagomorpha. The cattle is dominant in the representations of all periods, followed in the PPNA by snakes, carnivores and birds. In the Early PPNB the snake is always present, the birds still appear in relatively large numbers. In line with the raising practices in the Middle PPNB, the ruminants dominate. All represen- tations are pretty much the same in Northern Syria and in Southeast Turkey (Helmer et al. 2004). As far as the fauna is concerned, the changes are gradual but significant. A study of three sites in the upper valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates points out distinct evolutions, which allow to explain the gradual passage from hunting to domestication. At Göbekli (end of PPNA), the gazelle makes still up 51% of the retrieved fauna, followed, far behind, by the aurochs (17%), the Equidae (8%), the fox (7%), the Ovicaprinae (6%) and the wild pig (5%). At Nevali Çori (Early and Middle PPNB), the gazelle still dominates (52%), followed by the wild pig (11%), the Ovicaprinae (10%), the aurochs (7%), and finally the fox (3%). But over the length of the occupation, evolutions are observable: the gazelle, for instance, represents 62% at the beginning of the occupation but no more than 40% at the end; the size of the individual animals diminishes constantly. The size of the Ovicaprinae diminishes also, but their proportion within the fauna increases from 10 to 20% and the percentage of young ani- mals from 45% to 70% (Peters et al. 2005). That evolution is put to the account of an increasing control of the herds. At Gürcü Tepe (Late PPNB), the Ovicaprinae, morphologically wild, are, with 58%, definitely dominant, but among them one finds 5% of the sheep and 1% of the goats that are morpho- logically domestic. The gazelle represents no more than 3%, against 19% for the wild pig turned domestic, accompanied by a significant diminution in size, and 12% for the aurochs, which is perhaps not quite a cattle yet but has also undergone an important diminution in size (Peters et al. 2005). Looking at the process on the larger scale of the complete Near East, the results are the following: in the Northern Levant, the domestication of goat and sheep is achieved by the end of the Early PPNB, and widespread in the Middle PPNB (Halula, Abu Hureyra). At Halula, cattle and pig are domesticated by the end of the Middle PPNB. Those four 'major' species, the pillars of the agro-pastoral economy, are, by the Late PPNB, present everywhere (Peters et al. 1999). In the Zagros, the goat was independently domesticated in the Early PPNB, while the sheep arrived later, already domesticated, at the beginning of the Ceramic Neolithic (Zeder 1999 and 2008). Also in the Southern Levant the goat was independently domesticated at the end of the Middle PPNB, while the already domesticated sheep was introduced at the end of the Late PPNB (Horwitz et al. 1999). The status of the cattle is interesting. For Ain Ghazal, A. van den Driesch proposes a local attempt at domestication, which failed, however, for the cattle's size grows again in the Yarmukian. The boar remained wild. The ensuing balance is this: in the Early and Middle PPNB, the focus of the domestication of sheep lay in the upper Euphrates valley, that of the pig in Southeast Anatolia. The ubiquitous sheep had spread over all of the Fertile Crescent by the late PPNB. The goat was independently domesticated, in the Zagros and in the Southern Levant, in the Middle PPNB (Zeder 2005). The aurochs had originally been domesticated in the Middle Euphrates (Peters et al. 2005). While the process of domestication was still under way, all those species were transported over the sea to Cyprus. But some, for instance the goat, turned wild again, while the cat became domestic (Vigne 2009 and 2011). In the course of the preceding period, grains stemming from the collection of wild cereals were probably cultivated. Although impaired by the Late Dryas, this practice leads, under optimal climatic conditions, to the 'morphological' domestica- tion of the wild cereals, perhaps since the end of the Early PPNB, in the upper valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates. That is also the case of einkorn and emmer at Nevali Çori and Çayônii (Nesbitt 2002). The proof of complete domestication does not only lie in the size of the grains (more swollen) byt in the husk, where the difference becomes obvious between the 'solid' rachis of the domestic species and the 'fragile' rachis of the wild species. In the former case, the grains remain attached to the ear till they are ripe - making the harvest easier. In the latter case, the grains disperse, which makes the harvest dif- ficult except when wheat is cut on the ear. At this point, a technical detail becomes significant: the 'sickles', that had since then been provided with straight han- dles (reaping knives), get curved ones and the blades present a denticulated cutting edge.

Assembling and cut- ting several ears at a time is made easier (Ibáñez et al. 1998). Yet another instrument may have made its appearance in that period, the threshing sledge , which performs two func- tions: it separates the grain from the husk and it chops the stems. An indirect hint comes from the kind of temper used in the mud for building: while in the PPNA the temper consisted of husks the impressions of which let distinguish between wild and cultivated cereals, chopped straw appears in bricks of the late PPNB (Anderson 1998). In the Northern Levant the morphological domestication is achieved during the Middle and Late PPNB, when, in Abu Hureyra and Cafer Höyük, there appear even free-threshing kinds of wheat of the second generation (T. durum and T. aestivum ) (Nesbitt 2002). Taking into account the 'natural' reappearance of wild cereals (see above and Willcox 2005), the realization of their domestication right there and indepen- dently is acknowledged: barley and emmer in the Southern Levant, rye, emmer, einkorn and barley in the Northern Levant and in the High Valleys. For einkorn, DNA analyses point out a single origin from a wild stem on the slopes of the Karaca Dag, between Nevali Çori and Çayônii, while barley and emmer derive from multiple stems, at the same time in the north and the south (references in Willcox 2005 and Fuller et al. 2011). But the change is not a total one. The introduction of domestic cereals does not mean that the collect of wild cereals disappears. At Aswad, in the oasis of Damascus, wild barley makes up 62% against 26% for domestic barley (11% are not identified), slightly later at Ramad, the respective proportion is one of 35% to 49% (16% not identified). The fragility of the phenomenon must also be mentioned: several failures are known, such as the rye that, in the Natufian, was considered as domestic at Abu Hureyra but did not live on in the following periods, as well as diploid einkorn, which had disappeared in the Bronze Age (Willcox 2002). DISCUSSION After a look at the general panorama of the evolution of cultures that has shown that all of them possessed - to varying degrees - the complete range of the 'technical attributes' of Neolithization we now come back to the criteria considered, beginning with the concept of sedentism and the arguments brought forth to prove its reality. SEDENTISM / MOBILITY In Europe as well as in the Near East, the question has been raised after a premature sedentism, from 28,000 BP with the Pavlovian and from 20,000 BP with the Kebaran. There are several definitions of sedentism. There is the 'rigid' version by Higgs and Vita-Finzi (1972): "one place all the year round"; or the 'softer' version by Edwards (1989): "the greater part of the population of a community resides perenni- ally at one settlement". Still other softer definitions have been proposed, for example by S. Kent (1989) who considers that sedentism can be clearly put forward whenever a residence of more than 6 months at the same place is attested, but insists on a phenomenon, which, in our opinion, is more important than the duration of the residence, namely the periodic return of the group to the same place. That is also Edwards' view, when he opposes 'Paleolithic' mobility to the Natufian way of occupying space. The move would be from a "circulating settlement pattern characterized by marked lateral shifts in residence location to a system of seasonal oscillation between transient... and fixed residence points" (Edwards 1989). The change is important and characterizes European as well as Near Eastern sites. Recently, doubt has been expressed concerning the rela- tion between sedentism and neolithization, considering it as "an insidious hangover from Morgan and nineteenth-century evolutionary more generally" (Marshall 2006). However, this salutary questioning of a postulate that may have been gener- alized too quickly does not stand an examination of the facts: like it or not, in the Near East, agriculture and the raising of animals have made their appearance in the midst of cul- tures that nobody would describe other than fully sedentary. Whether there is a relation of cause and effect between the two phenomena remains a problem to which we shall return. At the same time it is also acknowledged that sedentism is reversible, meaning that a group that had stayed fixed for a cer- tain time span may, under external or internal pressure, return to temporary or definite mobility (Marshall 2006). Several instances presented above confirm that hypothesis. When, in his time, P.C. Edwards had doubts about the sedentary char- acter of the Natufian sites, he relied on the difficulty of an archaeological identification of the adduced criteria as well as on ethnographic counter-examples (Edwards 1989). The same doubts have been voiced with regard to the European Epi- Gravettian (Soffer 1985). More recently, B. Boyd (2006) has again taken up the prob- lem for the Natufian and has gone back to each of the indicators that are most often mentioned as proofs of that same radical Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="22">26 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI doubt. Observation of the dumps at the site of Wadi Hammeh got him to see a way of life combining "lengthy base-camp stays and intermittent evacuations", a view which - with a look back at the preceding definitions - insists at least implicitly on periodic returns to the same place. It is agreed that 'all-out sedentism' can no longer be sharply opposed to 'all-out mobility', but that there exists an infinite number of intermediate situations. In our view it is important to admit, if not perennial occupation by the whole group, at least a periodical return (of variable length) to the same loca- tion justifying the building of a durable infrastructure that will be used from one stay to the next. This hypothesis does not exclude the following one: perennial occupation by a part of the group, while an other part is on the move for seasonal activities (hunting, fishing, collecting, and why not?, war). Let us now come to the seven criteria considered by Boyd, that fall largely together with those presented above. Habitat As the first criterion of sedentism, Boyd (2006) adduces stone architecture, but there are many other building materials that need a significant investment of energy and time, begin- ning with the timber (cutting and transportation) and the earth: the quantities that had to be handled were considerable, at the least for the digging of the pits intended to hold the installa- tion. And we have in mind the making of lime and plaster (see below). We have seen that this preparatory excavation appears in Europe as well as in the Near East; the sizes are perfectly comparable, from 8 to 10 m in the Pavlovian as well as in the Natufian, with diameters of up to 15 m. The large collective dwellings of the Kostienkian, with a length of several dozens of meters, have no equivalent in the Near East. Another point in common is the circular or oval shape of all those dwellings, which is explicable on technical grounds: it is easier - espe- cially with tools made of wood or bone - to dig sub-circular pits than rectangular ones. As such large quantities of bones were needed for the con- struction of the huts, the location of "mammoth cemeteries" seems to have determined the choice of Kostienkian sites in Europe. In the Near East one might say the same for stone 'quarries'. Only the bases of the walls (mammoth bones in Europe, stone and clay in the Near East) are preserved, the lighter superstructures are left to the interpretation. But even under those conditions, it is difficult to imagine that such an amount of energy was spent for simple temporary shelters to be used in just one season. Even if the sites were not occupied all year round, the structures were probably put to use again from year to year. Between the houses, which come most often in tens, there are hearths, flint workshops, storage pits, sometimes trans- formed into dumps. Whatever the rhythm of removals of those populations, in Europe as well as in the Near East, and even if they remained hunter-gatherers, this new 'mode' of occupying a territory marks a break with the former way of life. In view of the shapes of the habitats, the break must not be put between the Natufian and the following PPNA - as Boyd (2006) would have it for the Near East. Examining the devel- opment in the long run, the limit must, for the Near East, be put between a 'before' and an 'after' the Kebaran, and, for Europe, between a 'before' and an 'after' the Gravettian. In the Near East, the preliminary pit excavation is aban- doned and the construction above the ground of rectangular buildings begins in a period (end of PPNA - beginning of PPNB), for which sedentism is certainly not doubted anymore. And still: this sedentariness is not more 'definitive' than had been the preceding ones, as becomes apparent by the return to mobility at the end of the PPNB. This remark does not invalidate the pioneering postulate by K. Flannery (1972), who associated the hunter-gatherers with a circular habitat and the farmer-herders with a rectangular habitat, exceptions always granted. In the Near East, at any rate, recent discoveries have to a large degree confirmed that intuitive remark, under the condition that a transitional period of variable duration is acknowledged. Heavy stone industry Because of its weight, heavy stone industry (grinding- stones, mortars, cup-holes, pestles and handstones) may be regarded as an obstacle to mobility and rather as a fixture to the soil, or, at least, as a reason for a periodic return to the same site. Finds of stone tools do not exclude the use of wooden mor- tars that may have disappeared without leaving any trace. The wooden "dish" on the floor of a burnt house at PPNA Mureybet (Stordeur et Ibáñez 2008) has few equivalents but was surely no exception. While in Pavlovian Europe only flat grinding-stones seem to be known, the Aegean Mesolithic uses also deep mortars, which, in the Near East, are characteristic of the Kebaran and the Natufian, before they disappear in favor of flat grinding- stones or grinding-stone mortars with a central depression, that may either derive from wear or was planned from the begin- ning - difficult to decide.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 27 grinding-stones are let into the benches meaning that the habi- tat was also the working-place. One must also point to the role of the rows of cupules that were carved out of the bedrock right in situ ('bedrock nortars'). It is difficult to imagine that this material was only used to grind ochre, even if that usage has left traces; one is more inclined to associate it with the treatment of vegetable food, as analyses of material from Pavlov VI and Kostienki 16 (Uglianka) have proven (Reverdin et al. 2010). In a more gen- eral frame, observations by ethnographers confirm that this material is used in the preparation of vegetable food; but use in the treatment of meat products cannot be excluded. That statement does not mean either that populations who did not use those heavy utensils did not know how to treat veg- etables, because wooden mortars could have served the same purpose. One must also take into account - as again ethnogra- phy can teach us - that the treatment of vegetables with stone utensils did not always take place in the habitat but at the very place of harvesting, where the heavy tools remained. That is the case with acorns, for example (Aurenche 1997). For our purpose it is important to insist not only on the strong correlation between heavy tools and constructed habi- tats, but also on the fact that those tools make it possible to treat 'new' varieties of plants - for example all the cereals in the Near East that appear along with the open forest at the beginning of the Holocene - or to treat more efficiently variet- ies that were already 'traditionally' harvested. The stone tools must not only be regarded as a concrete sign of sedentism, but also as features that were essential in the organization of large- scale gathering or even, at the end of the process, of agriculture. Structures for storage The possibility to preserve food supplies - vegetables or meat - for a shorter or longer term is a further corollary of sedentism, even if, as for the heavy stone industry, the pres- ervation does not only take place in the habitat but also at the locations of collection or preparation. Several techniques are possible, for vegetables mainly dry- ing, either by air or by heat; for meat and for fish, drying and smoking. Thanks to the climate during the Würm, a further technique in Europe was freezing in the permafrost. In spite of their differences, all techniques have in common that they leave few traces. . . The most visible signs of storage capacities are usually the pits dug inside or near the habitat: with an average diameter of 1 to 2 m, they are too small to be inhabited but keep the supplies at a relatively constant temperature and protect them from robbers. This technique does not rule out preservation at a raised place in containers made of perishable materials (bas- kets) that have left very few traces. In Europe, such pits are known in the Kostienkian and in the eastern Epi-Gravettian; in the Near East, in the Natufian, then in the PPNA and the PPNB (Bartl 2004). Burials In a more symbolic way, the association of burials with the habitat is also considered as a sign of settling to the soil or, at least, as a possible sign of periodic return to the same 'own' site as a prelude to a durable fixture. The habitat of the dead could then precede that of the living. That would also be a way of assuring the group's cohesion and of appropriating territory. We are here not interested in presenting the different kinds of burials but in stating their relation with the habitat. Also in that respect do Europe and the Near East share some features: although few in number, burials associated with the habitat are known in the Pavlovian and the post-gla- cial Epi-Gravettian, and also in the Late Mesolithic period. In the Near East they are known since the Kebaran, and, as we have seen, their number becomes considerably larger in the Natufian. In the PPNA there are sometimes real 'cemeteries' in the vicinity of the habitat (Nemrik). In Europe, the earliest col- lective burial with ca 20 skeletons was found at the Gravettian site of Predmost in the Czech Republic (Müller-Karpe 1966); another is known from the Late Ice Age at Volosovo, Ukraine. The connection between burials and installations is well estab- lished even if the former are not always found, due to the small extent of the excavated area. The same is attested in the European Mesolithic. There are attempts to go further and to translate the anthro- pological facts into demographical terms - if not absolutely at least relatively by studying the impact on the population of the 'agricultural demographic transition'. J.-P. Bocquet-Appel (2009) presents a number of conclusions on the basis of facts gathered in the Near East, in Europe and in North Africa. Moving from the Epipaleolithic towards the Neolithic in the Near East, a higher number prevails in the Natufian, followed, at the end of the Natufian, by a continual diminution, which corresponds to a "demographically stationary population". In the PPNA the curve "picks up momentum and rises con- tinuously". In Europe, the curve is "relatively flat during the Mesolithic. It goes through a kind of pre-Neolithic depres- sion, as at the end of the Natufian, then the curve rises very rapidly along with the introduction of the agricultural system" (Bocquet-Appel 2009: 308-309). Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="24">28 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZtOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI Those facts can be put in relation with the periods of sed- entism followed by returns to mobility that occurred several times in Europe and in the Near East. Actually, adopting or abandoning sedentism are among the causes of those demo- graphic fluctuations. Sedentism brings with it "an increased gain in energy" as the food based on meat or fish is gradually replaced by vegetable food, which provides more calories; at the same time, less energy is needed because the hunt is given up and for the mothers, the stress caused by the necessity to transport their children disappears (Bocquet-Appel 2009: 311). But there is a corollary to that situation. The sedentary way of life may increase the density of the population, but it also increases the mortality rate of children under five: lack of hygiene, new illnesses caused by the presence of animals in the villages, epidemics, etc. In conclusion: seeking to establish a relation of cause and effect between the demographic change and the economic change - the Neolithization - , one arrives at a strict coinci- dence. This is to say that the population was at the same time both, cause and effect of the cultural change (Bocquet-Appel 2009: 314). Thus, adherents and adversaries of demography as 'motor' of Neolithization come back to a draw. Richness and thickness of the depots This element adduced for measuring the degree of sed- entism is more difficult to quantify but is sometimes brought forth, in Europe as well as in the Near East. Extended external surfaces exist of beaten earth, up to 10 cm thick, deposited in one time as in Mlefa'at or Nemrik (Kozlowski 2002). The quantity of retrieved lithic artefacts is also mentioned, mix- ing tools and waste resulting from the production process (see above). Only a detailed analysis of the depots - which is sel- dom carried out - could tell us whether the accumulation of occupation layers is continuous or whether it is interrupted by phases of abandonment followed by returns to the site. Other arguments To the "archaeological" arguments B. Boyd adds, for the Near East, "biological" arguments, such as the remains of mice and rats at the excavated sites, that were attracted by stored provisions, but also kitchen waste. There have ensued long debates (see the bibliography in Boyd 2006). Another debated matter is the analysis of the cementům increments on the teeth of gazelles allowing to conclude when they were killed, namely winter and summer: a possible hint at longer stays or even year-round hunting (Boyd 2006). We shall come back to the questions of seasonality, for hunting as well as for collecting. Those are the principal criteria that are generally associ- ated with sedentism. It is important to keep in mind that, look- ing at the sites as a whole, the criteria are all there, in Europe as well as in the Near East. And we have seen that the debate about sedentism has been conducted, here and there, in the same manner and almost with the same terms. It is therefore justified to assume that an important break occurred at that time, a prelude to other changes that will happen later but that would probably not have taken place without that modification of a way of life, which the populations did probably not con- ceive either in its importance or in its consequences. That 'event' acquires its meaning in a process that took up much more time than has been imagined before long. Assuming this point of view and thus going back to the source, one begins to realize that Neolithization did not come about rapidly but, above all, that it did not happen in a linear way. Its path was punctuated with failures, with abortive attempts, as is shown by the several 'returns to mobility'. We may now come back to the other 'indicators' or 'fea- tures' of Neolithization. STONE-POLISHING Even if the technique of polishing is practiced on several materials, we are mainly concerned with stone. For a long time, stone-polishing was regarded as the main characteris- tic of the Neolithic period, today it is seen as one 'invention' among others. The polishing of stone has resulted in various realizations: statuettes and 'jewelry', tools (celts) and vessels. We shall later come back to the question of the meaning of the statuettes in the European Gravettian. Here we only men- tion the masterful technique needed for their fabrication as for that of jewelry (pendants from Brno 2). In the Near Eastern Natufian, this technique was also applied to small pendants (Cauvin 1978: 89; Maréchal et al-Harashi 2008), but above all to the fabrication of celts to 'replace' the chipped adzes that had first appeared in the Natufian. The fabrication of celts made of hard stone demands a big- ger investment, but then they live longer. The chosen material is not as easily accessible as is flint, and it is more difficult to work, namely in several stages: shaping, pecking, polish- ing. Ethnographic observations in New Guinea describe in detail the operational phases from getting the primary mate- Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="25">To be or not to be. . .

In the Northern Levant, the celts made of polished stone substitute the adzes made of chipped stone that had appeared in the Natufian. In the Southern Levant, the two kinds of tools exist side by side. On the one hand, their appearance goes together with the need for wood in building - the importance of posts and beams for all kinds of roofs has been mentioned above - or with the fabrication of objects like mortars and dishes (Mureybet), but in fact also with the clearing of wooded areas for eventual cultivation. The needed investment is even bigger for the fabrication of stone containers as they appear in the Natufian: open bowls with rounded bases. In the PPNA, a series of bowls made of chlorite and decorated with incised geometrical motifs seems to have a center of fabrication in the Upper Tigris basin. The productions are to be found all over the Northern Levant. And think back to the "plats à cupules" from Mureybet: polished discs with a low edge provided with a row of cupules at the periphery the function of which is not sure (Nierlé 2008). We have to mention also the flat and plain big stone plates, which are associated with kitchen activities, in Jerf el Ahmar (Stordeur et Willcox 2009) and Nemrik (Kozlowski 2002). Now the following question arises: apart from the celt, first chipped then polished, are there other specific tools in the Neolithic panoply, that are more apt than others to accompany the process of Neolithization? In the Near East, two could be mentioned: the bow and the sickle. SPECIFIC TOOLS Granted, no bow has been found in the Near East, but its existence is indicated by microliths some of which are sup- posed to have armed arrows that needed a bow to shoot them! Microlithics In all of the Near East, the sudden and massive appearance of microlithics coincides with the beginning of the Kebaran. Under the assumption that the microliths armed the arrow, it follows that the new technology corresponds to a customary use of the bow, if not to its first appearance. That hypothesis is confirmed by several discoveries in Europe: at Trou Magritte (Belgian Magdalenian) one microlith was found driven into one reindeer bone, or whole arrows mounted with microliths were found in the Swedish Maglemosian at Loshult (Kozlowski 2009). This new weapon is especially adapted to the hunt in open country, where the game is difficult to approach. In the Kebaran, the first microliths take the shape of backed points or of backed bladelets; in the geometric Kebaran and later in the Natufian, they adopt geometric silhouettes: trian- gles, rectangles, segments of circles (crescents). In the western part of the Fertile Crescent, microliths disap- pear ca 11,000 BP with the arrival of the PPNA (Mureybetian, Sultanian) but stay on in the eastern part (Mlefatian, Nemrikian). The appearance of monolithic arrowheads in the west, at the same time that microliths disappear, and their absence in the east, where microliths persist, is an argument a contrario for the use of microliths in arming the points of projectiles. The first 'small' monolithic points, called "el Khiam points", characteristic of the Levant, are not considered microliths. Monolithic arrowheads In the Near East, composite arrows are, from the PPNA, being replaced by arrows with monolithic heads. Since its first appearance, the arrowhead takes several shapes generally named after sites: el Khiam, Aswad, Byblos, Nevali Çori, Mureybet, Nemrik, etc. Taxonomie subdivisions are usually based on their distribution over space and time (Kozlowski and Aurenche 2005). Often, this new tool is regarded as a major criterion of the Neolithic period. However, in our view the 'invention', since the Kebaran, of the bow is the important element, and not the typology or technology of the projectiles points. At any rate it must be admitted that the monolithic arrowhead is more eas- ily adjusted and more aerodynamic. Nevertheless, the fact that the composite point continued to be used in the east has not obstructed the Neolithization of the eastern part of the Fertile Crescent. In Europe, the process goes the other way round: the mono- lithic arrowheads in the Alleröd and Dryas III (Ahrensburgian, Sviderian) preceded the 'big' microlithism in the Mesolithic period (Schild 1979). Shaft straighteners There is another particular tool which is generally associ- ated with the treatment of arrow-shafts. It looks like an ovoid or rectangular pebble having along the middle of one face a rounded groove of variable depth. The other face is sometimes decorated with incised geometric or animal motifs (Jerf el Ahmar, Cayönü, Göbekli). Supposedly, the tool was used to Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="26">30 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI straighten or polish the shaft at the extreme end of which the composite or monolithic arrow was adjusted (Kozlowski S.K. and Aurenche 2005). Similar objects are known from the European plain (Germany and Poland) in the final Paleolithic period. Sickle elements Other chipped tools may also have played a role in the pro- cess of Neolithization. They are known as "sickle elements" or "sickle inserts". Even with the naked eye the sheen on one of their edges and on a part of the surface is apparent. The sheen derives from repeated contact with matters containing silica, which resides especially in the stems of certain plants such as rushes, reeds and cereals. The origin of the sheen has been confirmed by an experimental traceological analysis carried out on reference items. Those pieces take several shapes: monolithic blades without retouches (Natufian), or, in the Mureybetian and the Mlefatian, with retouches. In the Sultanian they are known as "Beit Taamir knives". In the composite version, several ele- ments are put next to each other in a straight or curved handle made of wood or bone, or of red-deer antler: they are either plain blades that have not undergone any further treatment or they are triangular elements that have been retouched. According to the technique of applying the handle, the cutting edge is straight or denticulated. We have seen above that the change in the shape of the handle corresponds to a probable intensity in harvesting wild, later domestic cereals. With a curved handle and denticulated blades an increasing densification of ears in the field can be mastered. In the period under consideration this type of tool is apparently not known in Europe. None of the other tools, all inherited from the Paleolithic, such as burins, scrapers etc., that are part of the Near Eastern and European panoplies, seem to have played a decisive role in the process of neolithization. PYROTECHNOLOGY It is often neglected that toward the close of the Paleolithic the 'technical' use of fire, not only for cooking, is an integral part in the life of the populations. We have seen above the basins made of burnt clay in the European Aurignacian: they are not the bottoms of hearths hardened by the repeated use of fire. The basins have been coated with clay brought there on purpose and 'burnt' at a temperature of 400-600°C, probably right there and in a single operation. The bottom and the walls should probably be made watertight so that one had fixed 'cooking-pots'. In the Pavlovian, clay was burnt for the fabrication of figu- rines in an oven that was apparently reserved for that use (Dolni Vestonice). The same technique continues in the Kostienkian. Also in the Near East did the burning of clay make pos- sible the fabrication of figurines in the PPNA, although it is uncertain whether the operation was voluntary or accidental (Stordeur et Lebreton 2008). At any rate, by the Natufian the production of lime plaster had been mastered, demanding a series of complex operations: pieces of limestone must be calcined at a temperature of 800-900°C, until one retains a powder (quicklime), which is very aggressive on the skin and which must then be watered to transform it into slaked lime. After drying and renewed watering the mixture has become plastic and can now be worked into shape. It hardens in the drying process. A similar result, but less resistant, is achieved with gypsum plaster gotten by the calcination of gypsum at a lower temperature, that is between 150 and 200°C. There is no oven needed for the burning of limestone or gypsum: it takes place in an open pit. In an example from eth- nography, pieces of smashed limestone are piled on a heap of green wood. The transformation results from the double effect of the heat, the steam and the gases that are "channeled" by the fuel (Schreiner 2004). At Hayonim Cave (Natufian), a pit the bottom of which was covered with a white layer consisting of limestone fragments and round pieces of calcium carbonate is regarded as a 'lime pit'. In one of the habitats at Mallaha the walls were washed with lime (Valla 2008: 48). Oddly, this technique seems to have been abandoned in the PPNA but reappears the more forcefully in the PPNB. Yet another example of a technique that was invented, lost and found again. Lime and plaster are used to coat the floor in the habitat and to make containers ('white ware') before the appearance of ceramics. Here the problem of ceramics is only mentioned in order to state that, in the Near East, ceramics is not the first invention to benefit from a technology that has mastered the fire. It makes its appearance at a time when agri- culture and breeding of livestock have already been completely learned.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 31 THE DOMESTICATION PROCESS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS Not long since, the domestication of plants and animals2 was supposed to have happened rapidly, within a few genera- tions for the plants (Hillman and Davies 1990), in 60 to 80 years for the Ovicaprinae and 150 to 180 years for the Bovidae (Gautier 1990); now we are on the way to reach an agreement about the length of the process leading from the first experi- ments to perceptible morphological changes: more than a mil- lennium for the plants (Tanno and Willcox 2006), even two millennia (Willcox 2003), a millennium and a half for the ani- mals (Vigne 2009). The plants There is also agreement about the fact that the phenom- enon is polycentric, meaning that since the PPNA, if not before, manipulations and experiments have taken place, at about the same time, at several places and with several differ- ent wild stems: for cereals, for example, there is the domestic rye at Natufian site of Abu Hureyra and, much later, after an 'absence' in the traditional procession of domestic cereals on all sites, its 'reappearance' at Can Hassan III; barley in the Southern Levant and in the Zagros; emmer in the Northern (Çayônii) and perhaps also in the Southern Levant, although the latter place is contested; einkorn in the Northern Levant at Nevali Çori (Willcox 2002 and 2005). Today, genetic studies suggest that einkorn and emmer had two different ancestors in the Northern Levant, but none in the South. Barley would have had at least two independent stems in the Southern Levant and in the Zagros, whereas lentils had their origin in the Northern Levant, and, more hypothetically, in the Southern Levant and perhaps in the Zagros (see refer- ences in Zeder 2011a). Just as for the plants, there would be several different stems at the origin of the first domestic animals: up to six for the goats, three for the sheep and the cow, four for the pig (see below and Zeder 2011a). The latest researches suggest that if the first manipulations on plants and animals were undertaken at least since the PPNA and the Early PPNB - among prehistorians a fierce race after the oldest proof of domestication takes place every day - , full- 2. On this subject we now can usefully consult the paper, not yet published at the time the article was written, of Asouti and Fuller (2013) and notably the comments from G. Barker and A.M. Rosen (p. 331 sq.). fledged agriculture and animal-raising are not attested before the middle and late PPNB (Zeder 2011a and b). The rhythm of the process is again put up for discussion. There is no doubt that starting from a point A, namely hunting and gathering, one arrives several millennia later at a point B, animal-breeding and agriculture. At first sight, the pro- cess seems to be linear, but that is not sure at all: we have seen above a certain number of abandonments along the way. Domestication did not happen at once. One must imagine a course strewn with obstacles, failures or changes of direction, according to the model named by Redding the 'evolutionary paradigm' as opposed to the 'normative paradigm' (Redding 2005). Here lies the meaning of the title given to this article. B. Byrd (2005) proposes a slightly different model: he sug- gests two sudden changes in the wake of two favorable climatic ameliorations, one at the beginning of the Natufian with sed- entism, the other in the PPNA with the beginning of "life in villages". The two peaks are separated by a long platform of adaptation, during which the first experiences with cultivation are made before they are intensified in the PPNA. This bumpy rhythm is more plausible than a slow, long, and plain evolution, but the social consequences that he draws are met with more reservation: in the early Natufian, creation of social capital to the profit of the group; in the PPNA, cre- ation of social capital to the profit of the family and the 'lead- ers'. The model of Byrd has the tendency to 'smooth over' too systematically the failures that have occurred along the way. On the other hand, it puts too little weight on the continuity in all domains with the Kebaran (Kaufman 1992). Between the Kebaran and the Natufian there is a difference, not in nature but all the more in degree. It is all a question of scale: either one reasons globally, and in that case the model may, in the long run, appear linear; or one looks at the evolution in detail, and in then the course appears rougher, indeed. In the sphere of agriculture, climatic hazards come to mind. In 'pre-domestic' agriculture, which, a priori, does not know irrigation or fertilizer, the smallest drought may turn out to be fatal. A contemporary example was reported by a newspaper on the occasion of the Cancun conference on climate in December 2010. It is about the Maya community at Tabi in Mexico, where slash-and-burn methods of agriculture were practiced until recently: "For cultivation we used to burn down an area in the forest, clear the ground and sow with the help of a pointed stick; after two harvests we needed to bum down an other area, because the soil was already too poor. . . [But] since three years we have Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="28">32 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI had severer and longer periods of drought. Not only is there not enough rain, but it never falls when expected, and we lose our harvest. And when it is not a drought that destroys our harvests, it is a hurricane." (Allix 2010) Imagine the situation in the Natufian or in the PPNA, because people, other than the Maya peasants, then did not have at their disposal the 'model' of established farmers or the advice from agricultural engineers: "now we choose the best soil and turn it into permanent fields. It is difficult work: we remove all stones and stubs, we make furrows, and we organize a rotation of crops so that the soil will not be leached" (Allix 2010). A nice lesson in 'accelerated Neolithization', that can per- haps not be transposed unaltered to the Near Eastern Neolithic but that can render an idea of the conditions under which the first agricultural experiences took place! If the domestication of plants fails, we have to take also into account a more 'cultural' reason, as related in the today Turkey: "some women in the village of Kizilkaya told me that they made several attempts to cultivate the wild plants in their garden, but have found that the desirable sharp or bitter taste of the wild plants change when they are planted in gardens. This is probably an important reason why so few of the many leafy plants were selected for cultivation" (Ertug 1998). Everyone to his taste! We come back to the climatic conditions as they existed at the time of the presumed start of the domestication process. The Near East 'corresponds' perfectly to the conditions acknowl- edged by most of the observers. In most zones of primary domestication, at whatever period, the climate is warm and dry, with well-defined seasons: a short rainy season and a long dry and warm season. Dryness makes it easier to store the harvest - whether it comes from collection or from cultivation (Blumler 2002). But this general impression needs to be differentiated. Without entering into the details of the climatic hazards, we know by now: "that the diminishing intensity of climatic changes following upon the last cold stage of the Late Ice Age did not mean that the climatic conditions had become stable. The latest research about paleoclimates has demonstrated that climatic changes of the same type and on a planetary scale recur rapidly, that is, within one generation, every thousand or thousand five hundred years" (Berger 2009). That may have disturbed the first agricultural experiments, the example quoted above is a case in point. On a global scale, it is ca 15,000 to 14,000 BP that the wormwood and goosefoot steppe, which delivered a great amount of eatable species, began to be replaced by the for- est - mostly oaks and, subsequently, wild cereals - starting in the Southern Levant and moving northward and eastward (Hillman 1996; Cappers and Bottema eds. 2002). We have seen that the exploitation of such a milieu could begin earlier (see above: Ohalo in the Kebaran). One must take into account the existence of especially favored 'niches', such as the banks of lakes and rivers (Harris 2002). The map of the sites' loca- tion tells a lot in that respect. In Europe as well as in the Near East, the first sedentary sites, where, in the Near East, the first 'agricultural' experi- ments took place, were located in the valleys of the big or medium sized rivers (Don, Dniepr, Jordan, Euphrates, Tigris): there the first attempts were made at cultivating still wild plants. Due to the variability of their landscapes and resources the valleys offered favorable micro-environments. They were also the passage-ways for long-distance communications (see below). The question arises of how the soil was 'prepared' before planting. Some believe that slash-and-burn agriculture was preferred (Hillman 1996; contra Blumler 2002), a technique practiced by many groups of hunter-gatherers all over the world (Keeley 1995). Cultivation on alluvial deposits left by falling water is also imaginable (Sherratt 2007). The location of many sites along the main rivers in Europe as well as in the Near East is in this respect meaningfull. Why then did the process described for the Near East not take place in Europe, where the location of the sites along the rivers was comparable? There is a simple answer: because of the latitude and of the ensuing climate there were no wild spe- cies of plants that would have lent themselves to domestica- tion. Neither inclination nor mental and technical capacities are lacking but just the occasion to put them into practice. It was almost the same with animals, as we shall see. The animals Starting from Hallan Çemi, Redding investigates two pat- terns of controlling wild species, the wild pig and the mou- flon, and concludes that the attempt to domesticate the former was abortive (Redding 2005). He then turns to another, ear- lier attempt, that has already been discussed for a long time (Legge 1972; Cope 1991), namely the failed domestication of the gazelle. Rather than a "catastrophic hunt" he supposes a Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="29">To be or not to be. . . Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 33 form of control by isolating the males in the course of catching complete herds that are driven to enclosures (kites). According to J.-D. Vigne (2009), "the younger age at which gazelles are killed in the Levant, which Davis (2005) interprets as a con- sequence of exaggerated hunting, results in fact from such a 'pre-domestic' control, as suggested by Legge long time ago". Interestingly, the final result of the attempts was not the same for the three species. The first two have finally been domesticated, while the gazelle has always "refused" to be so, even if tamed gazelles do exist (Redding 2005 and personal observ.). Several reasons may be brought forth. Looking at the hunted fauna since the Kebaran, and espe- cially at the ungulates, one notices that their behavior and their territories differ. The social structure of the herds is not the same and most of the domestic species are gregarious. For example, fallow deer and gazelles are not submitted - as are bezoar goats and mouflons - to a dominant male, which man can substitute, in a certain way (Clutton-Brock 1987). As to territory, gazelles - never domesticated - and Equidae, which are not going to be domesticated before the 3rd millennium occupy open plains and migrate over long dis- tances. Mouflons and especially bezoar goats live in a more mountainous ecosystem and manage vertical migrations over short distances. The other two species, Sus and Bos, live in sheltered and humid milieus (riparian forests) and make their habitat closer to that of man, and they transform great quanti- ties of cellulose, which the human stomach cannot assimilate, into meat and fat, which are immediately accessible to man (Peters et al. 2005). For the reasons mentioned above, Europe did not harbor any animal species susceptible to (or that would have accepted!) domestication, with the important exception of the wolf (see below) and, perhaps, the reindeer. Certain Soviet research- ers have indeed suggested that there was control of reindeer herds in the Epi-Gravettian, but without any proof. Jarman had offered the same hypothesis for red deer in the final Paleolithic and the Mesolithic of Southern Europe (Jarman 1972), as Bahn (1978) had done for the horse in the Magdalenian of the Pyrenees. Several stages can be distinguished in the domestication of animals, but every attempt includes a phase of taming which, for certain species (gazelles, fallow deer), is the last one. Two methods are being proposed: either control of the complete herd or isolation of one or several specimens to be "raised" ( taming and rearing) (Clutton-Brock 1987). Uerpmann (1996) acknowledges only the latter hypothesis. Hole (1996) under- lines the role of women and also children in that first stage (see the burials at Mallaha). J.-P. Digard (2009) also lists some principles to be kept in mind: 1) with regard to the number of existing animal species, very few, just about forty, have been completely domes- ticated, but there are many more (more than 200) on whom man has tried to exercise control - unsuccess- fully. A similar remark could be made in view of plants; 2) no species may be considered as definitely domesti- cated, as long as there is still a wild specimen out of reach of domestication; 3) it happens that man knowingly calls forth a kind of controlled 'wildness', for example with birds of prey that are trained for hunting, a hypothesis that cannot be excluded in a Paleolithic or Neolithic context. Digard (2009) also enumerates the "duties" of man toward the domestic animal: protection (enclosures or buildings that serve at the same time as defense and as prison), supply of food and control of reproduction. The special 'status' of certain animals is also indicated by their presence, complete or in parts, in human burials. In the Near East, this is the case since the Paleolithic, for instance, a mandible of a wild pig associated with a human skeleton (Skhul), and the skull of a fallow deer at Qafzeh deposited on the body of an adolescent. In the Early Natufian at Mallaha, a young dog lay under the left hand of an elderly woman. In the late Natufian on the terrace of Hayonim Cave, two adults were buried together with two adult domestic dogs, two turtle cara- paces, and with a skull and the fragmented bones of a gazelle (Le Mort et al. 2008). Later, in the PPNA, one finds animal burials associated with human burials, for instance at Demirköy (an adult dog next to two adults). At Çayônii (Early PPNB) a dog and the skull of a wild pig are interred side by side with an adult. In Cyprus (Shillourokambos) animal remains (fallow deer, Caprinae, pig) were found in the middle of a collective human burial. In another sector of the site, the burial of a cat lay immediately beside the burial of a human individual (Le Mort et al. 2008). All those discoveries have in common that they either show animals that had reached or were close to the domestic stage (dog, cat, pig, goat), or other animals that may have undergone attempts at domestication but without success (fallow deer, gazelle). The fact that the latter were found in human graves or in special graves strengthens the hypothesis of a new relation- ship between man and animal. This 'new' relation between man and part of the animal world is well exemplified by domestication. It coexists with the hunt, the 'old' kind of relation established since dozens of mil- lennia but persisting throughout the Neolithic period. Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="30">34 O. AURENCHE, J.K. KOZLOWSKI and S.K. KOZLOWSKI As far as animal food is concerned, one can, in the Near Eastern context, never put enough stress on the perfectly complementary relation between the first cultivated vegetal species and the first domesticated animal species (with the exception of the dog and the pig, who are rather attracted by the leftovers that man has not consumed): of cereals and legu- minous plants, man consumes a tiny part of the total volume offered by the plant. He eats only the grains, because his stom- ach cannot assimilate the cellulose of the stems, which consti- tute the principal fodder of the ruminants (Weiss and Zohary 2011). Straw and chaff are also important construction mate- rial (temper, mud bricks). On the other hand have animal feces soon been used as manure on the fields. Obviously, there is a reciprocal interest in the presence of the animal, or at least of certain animals, in the neighborhood of man. That comple- mentary relation is not accidental. In that respect one may wonder why, at every site, cereals and leguminous plants are simultaneous. In traditional agri- culture, before the use of chemical fertilizers, the two families of plants were alternated in the same field so that the soil was not exhausted. The question arises whether crop rotation was practiced from the very beginnings of agriculture. Looking at human nourishment there is the same kind of exchange. Think of the 'revolution of secondary products', that could only be brought about by domestication. We talk about "renewable" products, such as milk, wool, bearing and tractive power, as opposed to meat, bones and hide, which the hunted or slaughtered animal can only yield once (Greenfield 2010). For instance, several studies propose that milk was exploited since the beginnings of domestication (see in Vigne 2011). Domestication of the dog This case is interesting, not only because it occurs at about the same time - around 15,000 BP if not earlier at Předmostí (Germonpré et al. 2012) - in Western (Bonn-Oberkassel) and in Eastern Europe (Mezin, Pavlov) as well as in the Near East, perhaps since the Kebaran, at any rate in the Natufian (Mallaha), but also because it is a special case within the pro- cess of domestication (Morey 2010). The phenomenon seems to be connected with sedentism. Possibly it was not man who went 'in pursuit of' the wolf, unique ancestor of the dog, but the wolf approached the habi- tats occupied for a shorter or longer period in the hope to find food among man's kitchen waste. Thus the dog would have domesticated himself (Ronen 2004). His role as a help in the hunt must at first be set aside, because such a task needs long familiarity. Even a tamed wolf is not easily manipulated (contra, Clutton-Brock 1984 and Morey 2010). On the other hand the hypothesis may be put forward of his role as a guardian over a limited territory (habi- tat or "pre-domestic fields") (Ronen 2004). In the Natufian, the dog appears in graves as a compan- ion with complete skeletons, distinct from incomplete animal remains also found in burials, for instance of the gazelle who, in its lifetime and being tamed, may also have fulfilled the role of a companion. The difference in size is certainly not the only argument for burying a whole dog and only parts of gazelle skeletons. Even before the horse, the dog is the first animal to have become 'man's friend', while the gazelle, even if invited, refused (and still refuses!) to play that role. At any rate the fact remains that the domestication of the dog opens up the way to a new relationship man/animal, and that without that first successful experience other 'domestica- tions' would probably not have come to pass. Whatever the direction of the movement - the dog being attracted to man or man's interest in the dog - it symbolizes a new attitude of man vis-à-vis the animal. 'ARTISTIC' PRODUCTIONS Figurines and statuettes Here we are concerned with the capacity to produce objects or realizations that are, at first sight, not useful - useful objects may also be 'decorated' - , in other words, the capacity to 'pro- duce art', more precisely, to represent living creatures - human and animal - in full or bas-relief or as engraving. In Europe that desire becomes manifest before the peak of the Pleniglacial with the female statuettes called "Gravettian Venus". They are either modelled figurines of burnt clay or sculpted statuettes of bone, ivory or stone. They represent women with marked sexual characteristics. Beside those rep- resentations there are schematized statuettes, where only the breasts and the pubic triangle are indicated. There are excep- tions, such as the statuette of a sitting pregnant woman at Kostienki 13, or the male representation in a burial at Brno 2. In the Epi-Gravettian the repertoire changes to exclusively schematized representations with the same sexual symbols. The "Venus of Eliseevichi" is an exception. In the Near East, on the other hand, in that period no 'artistic' production worthy of the name is known. We do not even mention here spectacular 'artistic' manifestations in the caves of Western Europe, such as the wall-paintings.

Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 35 realizations in the Natufian are not very spectacular: sculpted knife-handles with animal head, small statuettes in full relief. The eastern wing of the Fertile Crescent does not know this kind of representations at all. In the PPNA (Khiamian, Mureybetian and Sultanian), they are more frequent, but still few in number, and there are more human representations than animal ones. They are either sculpted statuettes or modelled figurines of women in a standing position. In the Sultanian (Gilgal) the representations remain schematized, and the sex is not as clear. In the Mureybetian, the clearly female representa- tions dominate, they assume an attitude (arms folded under the breasts) that announces a very long tradition in Near Eastern art, including historical periods. Figurines in sitting position are fewer (M'lefaat). In Europe, the representations of animals are either mod- elled or sculpted in the same materials as are human statuettes, and very rarely engraved (Kostienki 21). The repertoire does not consist of the consumed fauna, but mostly of dangerous animals such as mammoths, bears or felines. Those represen- tations disappear after the Pleniglacial. In the Near East the representations are more often engraved, especially on the shaft-straighteners of the Mureybetian. But mutatis mutandis the repertoire is the same: birds of prey, felines, snakes, scorpions, hardly identifiable quadrupeds (Canidae?). It does not reflect the consumed fauna either. Some statuettes in the Mureybetian and the Nemrikian show the same variety (Helmer et al. 2004). We are not concerned here with the 'meaning' of the objects, a topic which has called forth numerous contradictory debates. We just say that they appeared at a certain moment - the Upper Paleolithic - within prehistoric times and we believe that they marked a stage in the cognitive development of the human brain. One can always maintain that such documents existed even before but disappeared without a trace because they were made of 'perishable' materials, but the value of arguments a silentio is well known. Already the desire to make them of durable, if not "eternal", materials constitutes a signifi- cant step. Statuary A similarly important step is restricted to the Near East, because, with the exception of Lepinski Vir in Mesolithic times, such a spectacular change of scale is unknown in Europe. While the fabrication of figurines and statuettes goes on, veritable statues come to be made. The same themes that had before been presented on pillars in low-relief (Göbekli) or in full relief (Jerf el Ahmar, Nevali Cori, Göbekli) appear now in monumental shape. Let us remember that non-figurative art existed also in the shape of very rare - and thus exceptional - polychrome wall-paintings with a geometric pattern (Dja'de: Coqueugniot 2011). The passage from representation en miniature to 'life- sized' representation - or almost, and sometimes even big- ger than life-sized - that one finds all over the Levant, takes place either in cultures on their way to Neolithization in the Northern Levant (Göbekli, Nevali Çori), or, in the Southern Levant, in cultures that have already arrived in the Neolithic age ('Ain Ghazal). This is more than a coincidence, it is like a manifestation of the place from now on occupied by man in a nature that he begins to modify. Finally, the treatment of certain human skulls must be men- tioned: once they are separated from the body, their faces are remodeled and sometimes painted. That practice is not attested in Europe either, except in the German Mesolithic (Ofnet: Müller-Karpe 1966). The skulls were most often found hidden in groups, but at least for a moment they seem to have been exhibited, either as such on little supports of earth (Ramad), or - a hypothesis that remains to be proven - applied to 'dum- mies' made of perishable materials. Again, it is not our aim to broach the debate about the meaning of those practices (skulls of ancestors? skulls of enemies? maybe both!, see Testart 2008), we want to see the relation with the desire of those populations to put themselves on stage by making direct use of elements of the human body. There is an even more pertinent parallel in that the material used to remodel the faces - most often lime - is the same as that used to sculpt the 'statues' of 'Ain Ghazal, for example. This jump in quantity, not in the number but in the size of the representations, appears to us as another indubitable sym- bol of a new status, after the decisive step of the representation of man in the Upper Paleolithic. MOVING BY LAND AND SEA It may seem paradoxical to introduce the notion of long- distance journeys for populations after having made an effort to demonstrate that they had just become settled. . . The para- dox is only an apparent one, as the necessity to get hold of raw materials or simply to travel in search of new countries becomes even more crucial. There is irrefutable proof that materials have come from considerable distances. For the Near East, sea-shells originating from the Mediterranean or from the Red Sea but found far inland are offered as such a proof. Most often they are part of the jewelry found in burials.

KOZLOWSKI Here we will symbolically be concerned with just one material the traceability of which is ascertained by physico- chemical analyses, namely obsidian. The various volcanoes on the Anatolian plateau have supplied regions as far as the Southern Levant (1000 km) or Southern Mesopotamia (1500 km). Two main sources have been identified that divided the market among them: Göllü Dag took care of the western wing of the Near East (Northern and Southern Levant), while Bingöl delivered its products to the eastern wing (Jezirah and Mesopotamia). In either case, the middle Euphrates valley was the distribution zone between east and west as well as the border between the diffusion area from the two main sources. While still rare in the Kebaran, the imports rise in the Natufian and the PPNA, before they later increase considerably and even reach Cyprus (Chataigner 1998; Cauvin et Chataigner 1998). That last destination confirms the existence of exchange by sea between the continent and Cyprus since at least the end of the Epi-Paleolithic (Vigne et al. 2011). Firstly, groups of fisher-foragers approached various points on the coast (Akrotiri-Aetokremnos, Nissi Beach, Akamas-Aspros). Then, in the PPNA and Early PPNB, permanent settlers installed themselves close to the coast (Shillourokambos, Mylouthkia, Tenta), but also inland (Klimonas, Varvara-Asprokremmos, Politiko-Kelaïdhoni, Agrokipia-Paleokamina) (Knapp 2010; McCartney 2010). The provenance of the newcomers is still under debate: paradoxically, while most sites are situated on the south coast of the island, the settlers presumably origi- nate rather from the Anatolian coast than from the Levant (Ammerman 2010). But the white spots on the map probably reflect the present state of research rather than the archaeologi- cal reality. In the Aegean region, obsidian from the isle of Melos has been found on the continent, in the Peloponnese, at Franchti since the Final Paleolithic, as well as on several islands (Gioura, Maroula on Kythnos) since the Mesolithic (Broodbank 2006). With the beginning of the Neolithic it comes to Northern Greece. CONCLUSION With regard to the vestiges found, one can say that the men- tal and technical capacities of the populations in Europe and in the Near East were perfectly comparable and, over many millennia, brought forth a rather similar development. A close examination of the chronology even lays open that, in the Upper Paleolithic period, Europe had the 'lead'. Why then was the process of neolithization not finalized there? The reasons must lie outside of man: for reasons of geog- raphy and climate, Eastern Europe (but also Western Europe) did not offer an environment where plants or animals that would have been susceptible of a change of status were present. The techniques of acquisition, that all Paleolithic groups have in common, namely hunting and collecting, make life possible in almost any physical milieu. In some of those milieus - in the Near East - , successive manipulations have in addition resulted in a progressive modification of certain, but not all, species. Elsewhere - in Europe - ■, attempts may have been made but were not crowned with success. In that case, not the cultures were not ready but the natural milieus were not, to paraphrase R.J. Braidwooďs famous saying! To come back to the Near East, where the process of Neolithization was finally brought to a successful close, the other lesson to be learned is that the installation of the Neolithic was neither sudden nor linear. Of course, on the scale of his- tory since the first appearance of the first hominids, it seems to have come about astonishingly quick. But on the chronological scale of recent prehistory the duration of the phenomenon is not a matter of centuries, as used to be maintained sometimes, but of many millennia. The new time scale helps to correct the impression that the phenomenon was installed with linear regularity. It is agreed by now that the process was, on the con- trary, uneven, with progress followed by failure. Meanwhile it is also agreed that The Neolithization' happened at several points more or less simultaneously and concerning different species. The role of the environment is decisive: the climatic oscilla- tions must have had an impact that is hard to judge today: leaving apart the warm period from 15,000 BP on (end of the Kebaran), that may well have favored a first round of 'manipulations' but was soon interrupted by the cold episode from 13,000 to 12,000 BP, one may take the amelioration of the Alleröd, at least in the Near East (Natufian), as the occasion of another series of 'manipulations' some of which seem to have been crowned with success (the domestication of rye at Abu Hureyra), but were in their turn brutally interrupted by the Dryas III around 10,800 BP. It needs the 'final' amelioration of the PPNA and the PPNB with the climatic optimum for the whole process to be installed. The short cold episode at the end of the PPNB does not endanger it again because domestication was definitely over. It seems as if, begun at a very early hour but several times interrupted, the Neolithization, or rather the Neolithizations, had taken their time to settle. Contrary to the current opinion according to which the Dryas III had "forced" the populations to "invent" agriculture and animal-breeding in order to palliate a supposed famine (Bar Yosef and Meadow 1995; Bar Yosef and Paléorient, vol. 39.2, p. 5-45 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2013</page><page sequence="33">To be or not to be. . . Neolithic: "Failed attempts" at Neolithization in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Near East, and their final success 37 Belfer-Cohen 2002), it is rather that this cold and dry episode had 'deleted' or 'interrupted' the process of the domestication of plants and animals, which had already begun, probably in the Natufian. That hypothesis should be able to reconcile processualists and post-processualists: acquired long since ago, the mental and material capacity to experiment with the natural milieu (neces- sary but unsufficient condition) was in conflict with the possi- bilities that same natural milieu had to offer (quite as necessary conditions but not more sufficient than the preceding one!). In other words, no Neolithization, if man does not conceive of the idea at a certain moment, but no Neolithization either, if the milieu is not able or prepared to offer plants and animals susceptible of 'accepting' the transformation. That is the les- son of the two or three dozens of millennia of human life in Europe as well as in the Near East. A point remains which, intentionally, has not been tack- led here: did the domestication of plants and animals happen by accident or was it brought about deliberately? The ques- tion seems to us secondary, as it is well known that all great inventions are partially accidental, but only partially: without an intelligent man (or woman !), who 'realizes' the value of the transformation that has occurred, the invention does not continue of its own accord. That was perhaps the way already in the Neolithic. The last question - that we are not going to elaborate here but that deserves to be asked - is the following: why did Neolithization not take place in Europe, while 'techni- cally' Europe seemed all prepared, were it not for a secondary Neolithization, which came precisely from the Near East? Part of the answer lies already in the question. We have seen that, in the Paleolithic, Europe seemed to be more 'advanced' than the neighbouring continent - just remember the development of wall painting, in fact more fre- quent in Western Europe - but Europe did not manage to get hold of the resources needed to master the next stage. While, in adverse environments and unfavorable climatic conditions, these cultures had gone far in the techniques of acquisition, they had perhaps exhausted themselves somehow in their quest to perfect the arts of hunting and gathering. It may have been precisely that quest after perfection and its corollary, hyper- specialization, that brought them to (or held them in?) a dead end, at least as far as economy is concerned. A perfect illustra- tion of Paul Valéry 's maxim cited above! ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the four reviewers of that paper. Their stimu- lating remarks made us grasp more sharply some epistemological positions underlying the model that we have presented here.
