<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lette ks the Editors I Dream, Therefore ... To the Editors: When I read Brian Hayes's recent arti cle "Computational Creationism" (Sep tember-October) I had a strong sense of d?j? vu. I had been exposed to these ideas before in a story written by one of the best writers of this century, the Argentinean Jorge Luis Borges. The story titled "The Circular Ruins" is part of a collection called Fictions, published in 1944. It is the story of a wizard who re treats to an old temple in ruins so that he can dream a man so precisely and with so much attention to detail that his dream can be imposed on reality it self. The old temple is dedicated to the god of fire; with help from that god, the wizard succeeds. The process is not easy, however; within the wizard's dreams, each human cell must almost be imagined, one at a time. The simulation was perfect, except for one small detail. Flames could not harm the dreamed man. They "knew" of his simulated nature because of their god's participation in his creation. After creating the man, the wizard's happiness was only marred by his fear that a fire would make his creation aware of his unreality. One day this happened. The dreamed man was ex posed to fire but was unhurt, and he thus became aware of his condition. Borges's story does not end there, however. A few weeks later, a fire raged in the mountain where the wiz ard lived. The wizard himself was not affected either! He was nothing but someone else's dream! As one can see, Borges's story con tains the key elements present in Hayes's article: (1) the magnitude of the task involved in a realistic dream or simulation; (2) the need for this task to proceed from the smallest elements; (3) the fact that the only way a simulat ed being would know of its condition would be from the errors, or glitches, that would cause faulty program exe cution (in Borges's story, the anom alous invulnerability to fire is the "glitch in the Matrix"); and (4) the un nerving possibility that the simulator is nothing but a simulation itself. I want to note that the parallels be tween Hayes and Borges are not only related to substance. The first sentence in Borges's story came from "Through the Looking Glass," a book also cited by Hayes. The "Taoist monk" men tioned by Hayes is Chang Tzu. Borges also tells us about Chang Tzu in "New refutation of time" (Other Inquiries, 1952). According to Borges, "some twenty-four centuries ago [Chang Tzu] dreamed that he was a butterfly, and upon wakening knew not if he were a man who dreamt he was a butterfly or if he were a butterfly who was now dreaming to be a man." "The Circular Ruins" is a good title. These parallels reinforce the idea, pro posed by Hayes himself, that "the fear that the world we know?or think we know?might be nothing but a com puter simulation is a nerdish version of a much older idea." Or, as Borges put it (in "Pascal's Sphere," Other In quiries) "world history is the history of the diverse intonation of some [very few] metaphors." The fact that those metaphors are so very few indeed is another argument in favor of the hy pothesis that reality itself may be noth ing but a simulation!

Stinging Criticism To the Editors: James Nieh's article on stingless bee foraging (September-October) includ ed a one-sentence dismissal of our four decades of research on European hon eybee foraging behavior, as well as our experimental challenge of the famed dance "language" hypothesis. One might well wonder why Dr. Nieh did not include reference to any of our re cent and fully refereed publications so that readers could determine for them selves the validity of his claim. Consider a few relevant facts: (1) In its half-century of existence, the bee language hypothesis has provided no practical benefit to beekeepers; (2) hon ey bees fail to recruit naive bees to a food source that lacks distinctive odor; (3) dance-language proponents appar ently can no longer phrase a concise scientific statement (one with predic tive power) of their favored hypothe sis, a necessary condition for future quality research; and (4) a great body of negative evidence has accumulated that conflicts with Karl von Frisch's original (1946) interpretation. The dance-language controversy thus remains an exciting episode in the nature of scientific inquiry. We classify it with other sidetracks in science, in cluding N-rays, polywater, water with a memory and cold fusion. Proponents in each case relied heavily on "sup portive" evidence and ignored con trary facts as they struggled to keep their belief systems intact. The notion of bee "language" has followed a simi lar path. One can easily conduct a teaching experiment on this topic. First, provide some students with the dance-lan guage hypothesis (in whatever form) and supply supportive evidence of that view. Next, provide contrary evidence about how bees rely on odors of food sources that drift downwind, just as other insects do. Observe, then, how that body of students holds onto the notion of a bee language, despite the negative evidence presented. (Indoctri nation occurs readily with exotic topics such as this.) Then, give another group of stu dents the competing odor-search hy pothesis with its supportive evidence, as first elucidated by von Frisch in 1937. Follow that presentation with an argument for dance language. After completing those preparations, bring all those students together to dis cuss the available evidence and possi ble interpretations. One usually finds two groups of students with irreconcil able viewpoints! At this juncture, one can ask the students: Is it conceivable that honey bees do not have a dance language? Dr. Nieh's answer to that question appears easy to guess from his dismissal of our work. But science students can gain much from debate about the implications of how else that question might (and we would argue, should) be answered. Perhaps a more interesting question is: Why has the anthropomorphic model been so seductive and persis tent? While some observers passion ately invoke purposeful, human-like language to explain the recruitment of honeybee foragers, others see only the simple mechanistic behavior of using odor to conduct a search. The question 2000 January-February 3</page><page sequence="2">thus boils down to one of teleology versus parsimony. This all reminds us of a telling com ment by Charles Darwin, written to Al fred Russel Wallace in 1857: "... it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same fact." Adrian M. Wenner University of California Santa Barbara Patrick H. Wells Occidental College Los Angeles Dr. Nieh replies: In my recent article, I touched on the ability of honey bees to encode and transmit spatial information through the honeybee dance language. I then stated, "although Adrian Wenner later challenged many of these claims, sub sequent research showed that honey bee recruits are able to perceive and use information provided in the wag gle dance to find a food source at the correct distance and direction." I wel come the opportunity to expand on that comment. An experienced honeybee forager returning from a good food source that is at least 100 meters from the nest pro duces a waggle dance containing infor mation about the direction and dis tance to the food source. In Apis mellifera, these dances are normally on the surface of the comb, executed such that the direction to the food source with respect to the sun's azimuth cor responds to the angle of the waggle run with respect to vertical. Increasing duration corresponds to increasing dis tance.The experienced forager also car ries back the food odor through nectar samples that she provides, the pollen loads she carries and the odors cling ing to hairs on her body. In addition, a forager can mark good food sources with a pheromone produced in her Nasanov gland. All of these mechanisms were dis covered and elucidated by Karl von Frisch, and there is essentially no dis agreement about these points, as stated above. However, Adrian Wenner and Patrick Wells argue that honeybee re cruits do not use the direction and dis tance information provided in the wag gle dance and rely solely on odor cues to find advertised food sources. This is their odor-search hypothesis. In order to support that hypothesis, Wenner and Wells formulated a mis leading version of the dance-language hypothesis, one that gives no impor tance to odor cues. In 1990, they wrote in their book Anatomy of a Controversy: The Question of a "Language" among Bees, "we turn now to a formal state ment of the honey bee dance language hypothesis as we feel it was originally in tended by von Frisch" (page 63, italics added). Yet von Frisch consistently stressed the importance and role of odor cues in the recruitment of honeybee for agers. Indeed, the third chapter of his landmark book on the subject, The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees, is largely devoted to how "olfactory cues of two kinds facilitate the finding of the flowers by the newcomer" (page 56). Thus, Wenner and Wells have cre ated a straw man; what they attack is not the hypothesis as understood by Internet Addresses for American Scientist e-mail Letters to the Editors editors@amsci.org Permissions perms@amsci.org World Wide Web (all URLs begin with &lt;http://www.amsci.org/amsci&gt;) Author Guidelines /other/euidel ines.html V * I , Submissions Permissions editors@amsci.org /forms/perm policy.html Subscriptions Subscriptions subs@amsci.org /subscription/su bscriptions.html www.amsci.org/amsci/advertising/advertisers.html Learn more about these organizations; which currently advertise on the American Scientist Web site: Microcal's Origin 6.0 SPSS's SigmaScan Pro Research Software Design's Papyrus Version 8.0 SAS's StatView The Consortium for Plasma Science, LLC 4 American Scientist, Volume 88</page><page sequence="3">von Frisch or by most other scientists. Lacking adequate space here to re count the history of this debate and all its points, I refer readers to excellent re views of the subject by J. L. Gould (Sci ence 189:685-693,1975) and T. D. S. See ley (Nature 349:114,1991). Regarding the enumerated objections presented in Wenner and Well's letter: the first is completely unjustifiable as an approach to falsifying hypotheses and thus should not play any part in the debate; the second is simply not correct, be cause foragers can successfully recruit (although with greater difficulty) to a pure sucrose solution, which lacks an odor; the third is unsupportable, in that the literature contains detailed hypothe ses based upon the predictive power of the honeybee dance language; and the fourth is untrue?there is no "great body" of negative evidence. It is interesting that Wenner and Wells refer to an underlying motiva tion influencing supporters of the dance language hypothesis, the "se ductiveness" of the anthropomorphic model, while championing the cause of rational science. One wonders what subtle influence might be preventing them from truly understanding the hy pothesis they so much oppose. Time for Correction I was delighted that one of Mary Leakey's great contributions to science was recognized in Philip and Phylis Morrison's "The 100 or So Books that Shaped a Century in Science" (Novem ber-December). This delight trancends my disappointment that the Morrisons got their dates wrong (the hominid foot prints at Laetoli were made about 3.5 million years ago, not 2) and omitted the name of Dr. Leakey's co-editor (me). Mary would have been pleased, though, that the monograph was favor ably noted?she considered Laetoli to be her most rewarding project. John M.
