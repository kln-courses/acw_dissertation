<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROSS-CONNECTIONS AMONG PHILOSOPHIES AFFECTING EDUCATIONAL THEORIES J. B. SHOUSE Marshall College, Huntington, W. Va. Naturalism follows two divergent paths, in so far as it affects educa- tional theory. First, there is the stricter naturalism that is bound to the scientific concept. It adheres rigidly to the definition of naturalism as a philosophy which holds that ultimately all phenomena, including the mental, will be explicable in terms of the physical and biological sciences. Its most common current manifestation is in behaviorism. In so far as behaviorism is a philosophy, and not merely a method of investigation in the psychological field, its thesis is that consciousness is an unnecessary term, that consciousness is essentially a by-product of body per- formances, and that (so-called) mind will be accounted for through the explanation of these performances. Taking the conditioned reflex as the simplest term of behavior, behaviorists reduce education to the proportions of habit formation. The laws of learning are fundamentals; teaching is a matter of helping the pupil apply the laws of learning; effective study is a matter of efficiency in the utilization of these laws. These laws are discoverable through scientific experimentation. As natural laws they have universal validity. This is the point to be kept in mind relative to behaviorism. It emphasizes the universality of the essential procedure. That is not to say that the behaviorist makes all people equal or alike in ability. But nevertheless the laws of learning are the core of the behavioristic conception of education. There are laws of use, of disuse, of recency, etc. The pupil must be subject to these laws if he is to learn; direction and control by a teacher are necessary; the pupil has neither the knowledge of this scientific procedure in learning, nor the required self-control, to render him independent. Strange as it may seem, behavioristic education has much in common with education as defined by idealism. It is true that behaviorism denies the very heart of idealism when it abandons consciousness and ideas, for idealism stands for the explanation of all things in terms of mind as ultimate reality. However, idealism's second great characteristic trait is its interest in univer- sals. It is strongly monistic; it leans toward a belief in the objectivity of morality; it conceives of the individual as finding his greatest happiness and his maximum opportunity for development in social participation, in the program of the race; it asserts that the universal in man dominates over the</page><page sequence="2">CROSS-CONNECTIONS AMONG PHILOSOPHIES individual and the particular. An individual is a temporary unit in the age- long procession of human beings working toward a common end, by common processes. One must master at least a portion of the accumulated knowledge of the race, its spiritual heritage. This he must utilize in helping to carry on the process of re-creating the setting for human life. The essentials of human nature must be promoted as against inherited tendencies of lower orders of nature. All of this calls for direction and control from the outside. With totally different conceptions of life, idealism and behaviorism have some common ground in respect to education. Such elements as selection of the socially useful knowledge, of earnest study, of application of scientific information about the learning process, may confidently be advocated by idealists and behaviorists alike; both are concerned with the science of educa- tion. The second phase of naturalism is a sort of pseudo-naturalism. It empha- sizes the force of natural impulses and natural limitations of ability as well as natural capacities. The natural is the right, the correct. Nature's prompt- ings are her revelations. Nature wants her chance to develop the human being. At least in the early period of child development, nature should be free from interference so long as development seems normal. Man's knowl- edge of nature's laws is not sufficient to enable him to prescribe operations. Or there is too great diversity of human nature; there are too many factors in human learning; any law of learning ignores too many other things. This variety of naturalistic doctrine pleads for individuality, for freedom from restraint, from external direction. It emphasizes the value of inner direction. It asks us to observe-the natural tendencies of children. Children naturally love play, stories, etc. Our observations should not yield laws for directing activities so much as warnings against interference with certain activities. This type of naturalism may be called psychological naturalism* to distinguish it from naturalism proper. Psychological naturalism obviously must advocate an educational program materially different from that of behaviorism, one much less easily reconciled with that of idealism. Whereas idealism may readily be conceived as pre- pared to accept some of the methodological suggestions of behaviorism, it is much more difficult to adapt the method of psychological naturalism to the objectives of idealistic education. This is said in full knowledge of the contention of Rusk, in Philosophical Bases of Education, that Rousseau was an idealist. That is, Rusk would evidently have us believe that an idealist can harmonize a naturalistic method *In his Rousseau and Romanticism, Irving Babbitt speaks of "two main forms of naturalism-on the one hand, utilitarian and scientific and, on the other, emotional natur- alisL." By "emotional naturalism," Babbitt evidently means what is here called "psycho- logical naturalism." 1933] 359</page><page sequence="3">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION with his idealism, for surely Rusk cannot contend that Rousseau presents, in the earlier portions of Emile, anything other than a naturalistic method. Indeed it seems much more reasonable to say that Rousseau's philosophy at that point is a frank psychological naturalism. Suppose one were to grant that in other passages Rousseau speaks as an idealist; such inconsistency as being now a naturalist, and again an idealist, would never have bothered Rousseau. Certainly it is easier to think of Rousseau as veering with the wind of circumstances than it would be for a consistent idealist to accept the educational policies of psychological naturalism, free as the idealist may think himself to accept the method'which will most effectively lead him to his objective. Psychological naturalism has at least nominal interrelations with pragrpa- tism. These relate primarily to motivation. For example, the characteristics of the modern school, as set forth by Rugg and Shumaker (in the Child- Centered School) are interest, initiative, freedom, activity on the part of the pupil. So far as the words go, they might characterize either program, that of the psychological naturalists, or that of the pragmatists (the experimen- talists, if that term be preferred). There is, however, a fundamental difference in the connotations of the terms for the two groups. The psychological naturalist sees one thing in "interest"; the pragmatist sees something quite different. There is a cor- responding difference in the meanings of "freedom" to the two groups. To the psychological naturalist the important question about interest is whether nature has established in the pupil interest in this or that particular object. The pragmatist may be little concerned with natural interest; he is concerned with interest as a manifestation of purpose. Bode has pointed out that the correct interpretation of the pragmatist's conception of freedom is the achieve- ment of freedom through the exercise of intelligence, not of intelligence through freedom. To the naturalist, freedom means liberty to "obey that impulse," especially if that impulse was implanted hereditarily. What the pragmatists and the psychological naturalists have in common is the idea of a dynamic psychology, although they do not stress the same dynamic. The relationship between pragmatism and idealism is comparable to the relationship between naturalism and psychological naturalism. Psychological naturalism is a modified naturalism-with reduced attention to metaphysical questions, retaining the general concept of the importance of nature's forces, applying that idea to the problem of the driving power in human activity. It is no far-fetched conclusion which views pragmatism as a modified idealism-with little emphasis on metaphysics, but with high value placed upon thinking as the driving and guiding force in human activity. Calkins, for example, has said that "pragmatism, as an emphasis on the 360 [May</page><page sequence="4">CROSS-CONNECTIONS AMONG PHILOSOPHIES significance of feeling and action, is no independent system of philosophy but a psychological doctrine compatible as well with idealistic as with realistic, with monistic as with pluralistic, systems." Childs notes that the pragmatist accepts the idealist's view of man as exercising the function of "intelligent reorganization and reconstruction of affairs." Again Childs says: "Were we to accept certain.statements of the experimentalists at full face value, we would be led to conclude that as a philosophy it has no interest in a general world view, and is directed exclusively to the development of a philosophic method." Quoting R. B. Perry: "Pragmatism is never far removed from that dogmatic anthropomorphism, that instinctive or arbitrary adoption of the standpoint of practical belief, that is so central a motive in idealism." Horne "holds that idealism conserves all the proper values of pragmatism." The educational program of pragmatism is consequently less at variance with idealistic education than is the program of psychological naturalism. Liberally disposed idealists may discard much of the pragmatic doctrine and retain the method it offers for the achievement of idealistic objectives, and in so doing feel that they have not abandoned their idealism. Thoroughgoing idealists are, however, likely to consider that the method of the pragmatists demands the abandonment of a socially devised educational program for a pupil device. They will insist that they want "the individual to understand social life sufficiently and to be sufficiently adaptable that he can perceive and grasp the chances the social program offers him to pursue and achieve his purposes within and because of this social program." Whatever may be the merits of realism as a philosophy, its bearing upon education is not clearly evident. "A developed realistic philosophy of educa- tion is a real present need," says Home. Of the three major philosophies, then, three assign definite characters to education. If psychological naturalism may be given momentary recognition as a fourth point of view, in addition to naturalism, idealism and pragmatism, we have four more or less independent conceptions of education resulting from the four views of life. However, these four have such interrelations that they reduce in effect to two dominant educational philosophies. The two parent and more complete philosophies present an idealistic- naturalistic (scientific) view of education committed to the idea that learning is work, to be carried on in all seriousness, under direction of skilled, intelli- gent teachers, trained to their calling, informed in the science of education. In this combination idealism contributes the more significant elements. On the other hand, psychological naturalism and pragmatism (both, as here presented, modifications of the parent philosophies) unite in the effort to bring a different spirit into education. Each manifests its characteristic bent, it is true, but they meet at a common point. And here again the con- 1933] 361</page><page sequence="5">362 PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION [May tribution of the offspring of idealism is more significant than the contribution of the offspring of naturalism. On the whole, education in America has been permeated with idealism because our whole habit of thought has been of that temper. As the sternness and severity of pioneer conditions have disappeared there has appeared a liberalizing tendency, but that tendency has, as yet, not offered satisfactory substitute for idealistic objectives and curriculum. Such success as it has had has been limited to the field of method.</page></plain_text>
