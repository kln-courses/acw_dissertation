<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ESTABLISHING OF OSIRIS. By G. D. Hornblower, F.S.A. 38 In a previous article (MAN, 1937, 186, p. 155, col. 2) reference was made to the usually accepted conclusion that Osiris was indeed a king who once ruled in Egypt. This conclusion received sup- port from Egyptian writings and representations of the god in historical times, but there is high likelihood that in far previous ages he was not a definite indi- vidual but had developed with the passage of time, in mythological manner, from the great spirit governing vegetation whom we may conveniently call Asari and who in Assyria and Babylonia was made concrete, in the former country as a definite god, supreme in rank, and in the latter as a form of the god Marduk when his rites were specially directed to the sphere of vegeta- tion: see MAN, 1943, 16, p. 31, col. 2. Details in con- firmation of the equation of Osiris with Asari have been supplied by Sir Ernest Wallis Budge, From Feti8h to God, pp. 188 ff. We are not, in this connexion, to figure 'spirit ' as an actual form. The Greek-derived daimon may be preferred as a general denominatiQn for the class of imaginary being to which Osiris, regarded as above, belonged, because the term 'spirit' is too closely con- nected in modern usage with entities and ideas differ- ing greatly from those being dealt with here, and ' daimon ' has long been made current in the history of ancient religions by the pregnant genius of Jane Harrison. She figured it as a kind of numen born of a psychological 'projection' from human desires and hopes, immediately and without the material basis indispensable in all such matters: her interpretation was thus an affair of strictly subjective psychology (see Themis, chapter viii, p. 168 and passim). This material basis is probably discoverable in the early workings of animism, the original source of a daimon being the spirit of some great departed ancestor who was specially eminent in the branch of life concerned- in this case the care of crops-and was credited with a superabundant endowment of mana; it had become vague and almost impersonal-a fate, be it noted, common to its kind. The ancient daimon here shadowed forth was not the mere intermediary between gods and mortals that was postulated later, as for example, by Hesiod, but was fairly equivalent to the vaguely imagined numen who might be figured as of general character or as controlling a special depart- ment of earthly activities. The latter class multiplied exceedingly in some countries, notably ancient Rome and China; they seem, as exemplified, to a consider- able extent, in the vague beliefs of the Veddas of Ceylon 1 to have been first imagined as the spirits of dead ancestors traditionally pre-eminent, even though their names were forgotten, in the department of life concerned; they would thus become eventually 1 Described by Professor and Mrs. Seligman on pp. 126-176 of their monograph; Bailey's brief summary on p. 160 is recommended by the authors, who have given another in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, XII, pp. 598, ff. The difference between yaku, which may be translated as " spirit," and deyo, or " god " seems quite slight, just as in Homer theos and daimon are often interchangeable. The yaklu became almost departmental gods, for hunting and against disease, but not nearly as developed as in ancient Rome or China, where such beings carried to great extremes man's universal-and most understandable-tendency to anthropo- morphism. [ 59 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 38] MAN [May-June, 1945 ' departmental gods,' with human characteristics, following man's universal-and most understandable -tendency to anthropomorphism. This subject has been handled with great skill in Professor Nilsson's illuminating History of Greek Religion, especially in the fifth chapter; in chapter iv, pp. 108 if., he illustrates the tendency with the case of Demeter who was evolved from the 'luck' or mana of the standing crop which must be preserved by the Last Sheaf or its equivalent (see MAN, 1937, 209, p. 177, col. 2, and the confirmation in Dr. Montell's paper on the Torguts in J.R.A.I., LXX, p. 83). The great advance made in Egypt at the beginning of the Gerzean period (MAN, 1941, 71, p. 97, col. 2) should therefore be attributed to the entry into Egypt, not of ' Osiris ' but rather of ' the Osirians who, as we may well conclude, introduced the system of organ- ized irrigation which established the then unparalleled prosperity of the country. The probability of peace- ful penetration rather than armed invasion is now clear, the more so that the only wars of predynastic times of which traces are left are those between Horus, joined by Osiris, and Set which were of entirely interior order, tribal in origin.2 Osiris, as a concrete deity becoming Egyptian, was intimately absorbed into the native cult, becoming mythologically the father of the great tribal god, the Falcon Horus (MAN, 1937, 186, p. 156, col. 2); he was accordingly figured as having had the chief post in all tribal vicissitudes. His adoption has parallels elsewhere, a curious case being that of Avalokiteshvara, a Buddhist male saint who, when adopted in China, underwent a strange con- version into the madonna-like goddess Kwanyin. This complete adoption of Osiris conferred on him the position of chief actor in the great national hiero- gamy which was, for the people, the supreme rite of their world, surviving strongly from past centuries- perhaps even millenia-and satisfying the emotion- ality accompanying, as it ever does, a really operative religious feeling. Here, if nowhere else, we may find the reason reported by Herodotus (II, 42) why, while the worship of other gods varied in different parts of Egypt, that of Isis and Osiris remained invariable. Here, also, we may find the reason of the very wide extent of the practice of hierogamy, plentifully illus- trated in the second volume of Frazer's Golden Bough; much has been added to his outlook by later writers, such as Miss B. S. Philpotts in The Elder Edda and Ancient Scandinavian Drama (v. p. 119). Regarding the supposition that these fructifying elements entered from the north-east of the Delta, attention must be accorded to the peoples to the west, -known colleetively as 'Libyans.' Sergi, Elliot Smith, and others have shown them to be of the North African branch of the stock to which we may for con- venience sake-and that only-apply the name 'Hamitic.' It extended from Somaliland, the Punt or ' Land of the gods ' of the ancient Egyptians, and Abyssinia, through the Nile Valley, to all the North African region and, according to Elliot Smith in the second edition of his book on The Ancient Egyptian8, much further; it was, of course, a mixed stock, but it is not necessary here to take account of possible ele- ments in its composition, such as the Nordic predi- cated by Professor Raymond Dart in J.R.A.I., LXX, p. 23, Frobenius, in his zeal for the ' Master-folk,' claimed the ancient Egyptians as their ultimate repre- sentatives in Africa, nearer ones being the peoples who gave some of the modern Berbers their blue eyes. Professor Frankfort, in the Griffith Studie8, pp. 450-3, postulates the basing of the Hamitic on an ancient substratum covering all the northern parts of Africa and perceptible not only in beliefs but also in social structure and even in material things. Turning now from the racial to the climatic aspect of the matter, we find strong evidence of a wetter period in predynastic Egypt than in later times. This has been well demonstrated in Professor Newberry's remarkable Presidential Address to the Anthropo- logical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Liverpool, 1923. There the Nile valley of predynastic times is displayed as ex- ceedingly marshy, like the Delta in its later phase. The Delta itself in the earlier times must have been covered almost entirely with marshes, uncanalized and undrained-ven to this day it holds wide expanses of that kmid; it was indeed an exceedingly unlikely birthplace for a high civilization. Herodotus (II, 7) describes it as wide, flat, and muddy, in fact a swamp which was used in the Saitic period as a place of exile (II, 152) ; he holds the view (II, 15), against that of 'the Joniar' (8c., Hecataeus) that the Delta became a place of settled habitation subsequently to Upper Egypt, as the Egyptians, he says, themselves maintained. The tall reeds of the marshland gave Isis concealment for her infant Horus just as they have done in our days-as I have seen-for stolen cattle; a picturesque and accurate account of them and the use of them by robbers has been given by Heliodorus in the early part of his Aethiopica, of the fourth century A.D. The 'Libyan ' Pegions west of Egypt, now desert except for the rain-zone on the north, extending from 40 to 60 miles from the sea-coast, was also, in the times under discussion, wetter, and much of it must have had a steppe-like character suitable for grazing large herds. Sure evidence of this condition is to be seen in the fragment of a votive slate palette of the 2 The fight between Egyptians and foreigners arriving in ships commemorated on the famous knife-handle of hippo- potamus ivory, found at Gebel el 'Araq, is of a much later date, not long, apparently, before the unification of the country.

Sethe dis- covered on the edge of the fragment the hieroglyphic sign for Libya; the Egyptian king, as falcon, lion, and scorpion, is figured breaking down various walled towns which are distinguished hieroglyphically- perhaps the walls are merely symbols registered under the impress of Egyptian features and not actual, though we may note that it is still the custom in desert Arabia to build walls round even small villages as an aid against the inveterate custom of raiding (ghazzu). The strength and pastoral prosperity of the land are clearly proved; they continued several centuries later when, in the Fifth Dynasty, King Sahure's inscriptions record a huge similar booty con- sisting of 123,440 oxen, 233,400 asses, 232,413 goats, and 243,688 sheep; in the Twelfth Dynasty Senusert I recorded the capture there of ' cattle of all kinds with- ' out number : see Newberry's Presidential Address- he also relates to Libya the great votive mace-head of Narmer now in the Ashmolean Museum. The king is represented as holding a sed festival, a kind of recon- secration, in which he has donned the red crown emblematic of the kingship of the Delta; a record of booty is included-120,000 prisoners, 400,000 oxen, and 1,422,000 goats-but in all such enumerations we must presumably recognize the gross exaggeration usual in early records of oriental courts. For the problems raised by these early relics see the C.A.H., I, pp. 244-256 and 268. Much later, in the seventh century B.C., according to Herodotus (IV, 155) the Libyan Cyrenaica was characterized by the Delphic oracle as ' sheep-feeding '-perhaps a kind of stock- epithet of the sort common in Epic poetry; it was also referred to as ' lovely ' or ' beloved ' (id. 159) and glowing accounts of it are strewn through the author's fourth book, extolling it for its healthy men, plentiful harvests, and renowned horse-chariots. In modern times, according to Hogarth (Enc. Brit., 11th ed., VII, 703c) this part of Libya bears millions of sheep; it is to-day an object of the greatest consideration to the Aulad Ali bedouins of the Egyptian western desert, under the name of el Gebel el Akhdar, meaning 'the 'Green Desert' or 'Hill,' gebe meaning either. The ' Libyans ' were not confined to the northern rain-zone of Africa but stretched far southwards, even to the region of the First Cataract and this, in view of their racial connexion, is not surprising. Details establishing this condition have been amply gathered by Oric Bates in The Western Libyans (London, 1914) and W. Holscher in Libyer und Agypter (Gliickstadt, 1937); evidence from rock-drawings also has been provided by D. Newbolt in Antiquity, September, 1928, pp. 261-291, and J. H. Dunbar in The Rock Pictures of Lower Nubia, which contains many appo- site references. Account has always been taken of the Libyan character of the north-western portion of the Delta, proved by the report of Herodotus (II, 18) that the inhabitants claimed to be Libyan and actually did not speak the Egyptian language, but the great probability of the wide extent of Libyan settlement seems to have escaped notice. It is readily discernible in the Fayoum whose patron-god, the crocodile Sebek, was declared by the Pyramid Texts (par. 510) to be the son of Neith who was the Libyan avatar of the divine Great Mother, as Hathor, followed by Isis, was in Egypt; Lanzone has published a representa- tion of her actually suckling two crocodiles (Diz. Mit., P1. 175); Holscher has gone so far as to suggest that Libyans originated in the Fayoum (p. 120). Deductions from records of animal-worship are often valuable and will be useful here in the case of the ram. This creature was worshipped in Libya, as Herodotus has shown in his account of the Oasis of Ammon (II, 42), and the prevalence of the practice in prehistoric times has been proved by the rock-draw- ings of western Libya which display him crowned and, standing before him, a man in the attitude of worship -the buffalo also shared this honour (see Frobenius and Fox, African Genesis, p. 24, fig. 2), not to mention the well-known case in Oran illustrated by Capart (p. 204, fig. 161). Now, Amufn of Thebes was also a ram-god and there were others in Egypt such as Khnum who was god of the district round the First Cataract where traces of Libyans have been discovered by both Bates and H6lscher; at Esna he had as con- sort the great Libyan goddess, Neith: a close likeness between Egyptians and Libyans is established by these two authors from the evidence of weapons, dress, and decoration-including the phallus-sheath (qar- nata)-and it seems nearly certain that the Nile valley was occupied not only by immigrants from the south, but also by settlers from the neighbouring steppe- land; it is indeed most likely that the latter created the settlements of Merimdeh and Beni Salameh as well as of the site in the Fayoum explored by Miss Caton- Thompson. These migrants were all of the same 'Hamitic ' stock and could easily agree together, at least until the increase of population, induced by greatly improved life-conditions, gave rise to mutual aggressiveness. To these we may add the prehistoric 'Saharan civilization' recently discovered in the desert west of Upper Egypt, for which see the report of the Mond-Myers expedition (The Cemeteries of Arment, Vol. I, pp. 267-277; also the J. of Egyptian Archceology, XXV, p. 143). In the Delta they could settle wherever cultivable patches arose from the vast [ 61 ]</page><page sequence="4">No. 38] MAN [May-June, 1945 wilderness of reedy marshes and among them we may well reckon the ram-worshippers of Mendes (8ee MAN, 1937, p. 172, col. 2) who, later, when the cult of Osiris entered their district, welcomed it so warmly that they adopted him as their patron-god in lieu of 'Anjeti and ' made of his image the emblem of their nome ' (see Budge, From Fetish to CTod, pp. 110 and 184); in the Pyramid Texts, par. 614, 'Anjeti is equated with Osiris. In brief summary Osiris may be considered to have originated with a great ' daimon ' introduced to Egypt by peaceful immigrants from Mesopotamian regions where he was known as Asari, or its equiva- lents. They introduced in the late Amratian period the art of skilful irrigational organization; so great were the resulting benefits that the Osirian cult was readily absorbed by the people who had hitherto wor- shipped, besides the Great Mother under various names, merely local deities, largely quasi-totemic. The daimon developed into a concrete god as Osiris, becoming the mighty head of the national fertility- rite with Isis as consort; she was the avatar of the very ancient and most widely venerated Great Mother who was thus conscribed into the Osirian circle just is she had previously been into the tribal Horian system under her name of Hat-hor, who preceded Isis as her avatar-yet she retained her original high status in such epithets as ' Mistress of Heaven,' ' Beautiful ' Queen of the goddesses,' ' Ruling all the gods' and so on (Lanzone, Diz. Mit., pp. 875 and 882, etc.). The tribal Horus, too, was similarly ingested, being made the son of Osiris. The fertility-rite was of very ancient origin and firmly rooted in the people's faith; when, therefore, Osiris appeared as supreme cause of the extraordinarily increased surety in life now enjoyed by them, due, as they would necessarily believe, to divine powers, they naturally made of him the protagonist of the ceremony which, from being formerly a local affair, now became the national one which we see displayed in Seti I's temple at Abydos. The position of Osiris in popular faith and affection was unique despite the supremacy officially accorded to Re; the solemnization of his rites was the occasion of strong public rejoicing and of a special indulgence in lewd songs and antics-commonly relished as they are by human nature (see Herodotus, II, 48, and Plutarch, de 18., sec. 36, who compares them with the Greek phallephoria). In many countries songs and jokes of this class are still customary at wedding-parties- rude epithalamia; they would be more than usually appropriate at this, the most momentous wedding of all-very likely the Turin papyrus known as the 'Obscene, when, after these many years, it is accorded publication, will provide useful additions to present knowledge on the subject. In ancient Greece we may note in this connexion the gephyri8moi, those scanda- lous bridge-jokes thrown at the Eleusinian initiates on their return to Athens from the celebration of their hierogamous mystery; the Dionysiac rites, too, included phallic hymns of which the famous Hera- kleitos scathingly remarked that they would be branded as 'shameless' were they not sung in the service of a god (fragment8 125 and 127). Songs of this character were widespread in Greek festivals, as we learn from Aristotle (Poetic8, Bk. 4, chapter 10), and under official control and in them Professor Cornford found the key to the problem set forth in his work on The Origin of Attic Comedy. Such are the main features of the coming of Osiris and his establishment in Egypt. Once this process was completed, other high functions were attributed to him in natural theological development; he became King of the Dead and also their judge, like Minos or Rhadamanthus in Greece, and as such presided at the Weighing of Souls which was naturally a favourite subject for funerary papyri, intended as they were to ensure magically a happy issue for the souls of their owners. Further, when the divine Pharaoh died he was believed to retain his earthly state in the After- world, a king and consequently an Osiris: later, when the higher courtiers waxed in importance, they too were privileged to attain the same honour, probably with the king's authorization when, as the inscriptions put it, he 'gave' them a tomb. NOTE 1.-At the end of my last article (MAN, 1943, 16, p. 34) reference was made to a version of the maneros which attributed two mothers to Horus. There is an exact parallel in classical mythology, recorded by Ovid in the Metamorphoses (IV, 12): the glowing encomium applied by the Bacchantes to their god- polyonomous like Osiris or Hathor-includes the unique epithet 'twi-mothered' (83olum bimatrem). This epithet was doubtless from the Greek; 8ee Diodorus Siculus, Bk. 4, chapter 4, in which book he also relates that a widespread feature of religious rites was the entry into them of phallic matters, welcomed with laughter and sporting play. A material instance is to be found in the parabasis of Aristophanes' comedy The Cloud8. NOTE 2. -Completion by Marriage is notably exem- plified by the conditions of kingship in Egypt where matrilinear descent was practised; the king, to ensure his complete legitimacy must marry a lady of royal descent. Here, it would seem, we may find the solution of the problem of the personality of Menes, the first king of both Upper and Lower Egypt (see H. R. Hall in the Camb. Ane. Hi8t., I, 267). I would suggest that his two predecessors, the 'Scorpion' and Narmer, were the effectual con- querors of the Delta, but that the conquest was not recognized throughout the country till their suc- cessor, Menes, married a princess of the Delta, [ 62 ]</page><page sequence="5">May-June, 1945] MAN [Nos. 38-39 Neith-hotep. His personal name figures in the list of Seti I's temple at Abydos as Mn' (vowels are often unsure) but his regnant name was 'The 'Warrior Horus' (Hor-aha) as Emery has fairly established in his monograph on the tomb at Saq- qara (pp. 4-7); he doubtless earned it by his final victories. By his marriage he gained recognition as first Unifier of the Two Lands; of this there is an interesting piece of proof in certain toilet articles found in the Queen's tomb, bearing her name with the epithet ' Uniter of the Two Lordships' (Petrie, Royal Tombs, II. P1. ii, no. 11). Menes seems also to have insisted on -his intimate connexion with Horus, for some of his seals bear the epithet ' Son of 'Isis ' (Emery, Hor-aha, pp. 23 ff., and fig. 1 D). It is worthy of remark that nowhere is there mention of Re; the solar cult had not yet risen to its supremacy. Another parallel, referring to the completion of a man by marriage, comes from a more primitive people of modern West Africa. The sorcerers of the Ovim- bundu, the largest tribe of Angola, use a special basket for divining; it is controlled by a spirit which, to ensure its efficacy, muist be provided with a female ' complement.' The sorcerer therefore gets a girl to spend the night with him and then poisons her, thus sending her spirit, properly prepared, to join with that of the basket (Mrs. L. S. Tucker in J.R.A.I., LXX, p. 178).</page></plain_text>
