THIS IS A WELCOME and useful book in a useful series: a brief text by a man engaged directly in ET TU... JACK? And Barbara, Betty, Bill, and Bob will understand ancient Rome better with these two new Latin texts from Lyons &amp; Carnahan. LIVING WITH THE ROMANS, by Irene J. Crabb, is a first-year text, skillfully planned to combine vocab- ulary and historical content. The theme is slanted to include social studies and contains material that compares Roman culture with today's living. Fifty-seven chapters, fully illustrated, relate individual stories of Roman history and mythology, emphasizing the association of Latin and English derivatives. ROME, A WORLD POWER, by Irene J. Crabb and C. Russell Small, the second-year text, gives students a broad view of different types of Roman literature from several authors -Plautus, Vergil, Caesar. Carefully edited to accomplish the transition from first- to second-year Latin, this text affords a deeper in- sight into the study of the origins of Western civilization through classical writers, philosophers and historians.

Its shortcomings are largely inherent in the nature of works like this. The subject matter is too big for thorough treatment within the limits imposed, and is changing faster than any book can be produced. To be sure, we are not faced by problems like those facing the physical scientists, but archaeology is only in part a sci- ence. The other part, historical and humanistic, de- mands a more deliberate pace. The Mycenaeans is dated 1964. Its writing had to be closed be- fore that, and so it contains no mention of the vaulted galleries at Mycenae or the secret tunnels to springs at Tiryns or the Oriental seals and jewelry at Thebes; and before this notice is printed there may be further equally startling discoveries. None the less, many will be glad that it was written. Teachers and students of the Mycenaean field and readers with special knowledge of other fields may turn to it with confidence, provided they are critically aware of the difficulties. A short introductory account of excavations and Mycenaean studies is followed by chapters on texts in Linear B and the Homeric tradition, chronology (based largely still on pottery), reli- gious beliefs and practices, architecture and tombs, daily life and the fine arts, warfare and commerce; and, in a final summary, an attempt to outline the rise and fall of the Mycenaean world. There is a substantial bibliography. Footnotes and spe- cific references are excluded. The author has to state his opinion or to quote that of another, in most cases without argument and with no more than general warnings that there is room for a difference of opinion. Too often he has to say "most scholars agree that. .. " We are not told who disagrees. The reviewer, for one, would question a num- ber of statements: that the invaders of the Troad and of Greece, being makers of gray Minyan pots, were necessarily "one and the same people" (p.23); that horses could more easily be led from the east to Greece through the Caucasus than transported across the Hellespont (p.26): that the Palace Style of decoration originated at Knossos (p.49); that "efficient, albeit bureau- cratic, organization" was learned by Mycenaean Greeks from the Minoans (p.168). On the topic of religion, of course, there is always room for argument. Of the Homeric gods Lord William mentions only the anthropomorphic aspect, that which appears most often in the poems because it fits the characters of the drama, and passes over the wholly impersonal powers that are equally divine; he then contrasts the worship of the Olympian family with the Minoan-Mycenaean "Tree and Pillar cults, religious concepts of almost universal validity" (p.61). Here clearly there is a great deal more to be said. I miss a reference to R. K. Hack's God in Greek philosophy, which ought to be cited whenever Homeric and later Greek religious thought is mentioned. The Mycenaean age is presented as a unit. Per- haps too little is made of its position in history. Perhaps again there was too little room for the larger theme. Is it symptomatic of this concen- tration that the author writes (p.162): "The earliest representation of a ship is found ... on a Middle Helladic vase fragment . . ."? Ships appear much earlier on pottery from the islands. And am I right in thinking that he brings the Mycenaeans to Greece as invaders in the six- teenth century (e.g. on pp.141, 166) ? If so, there is indeed a place for argument; friendly and fruitful argument, let me add, since everything in Lord William's work testifies to his plain honesty, modesty, and seriousness. Two final notes. As an excavator I must correct a not unimportant date: the terra-cotta statues in Keos are not "from the last phase of LH III" (p.224, item 19), but rather from the time of LM IB or even earlier, as ascertained in 1963 and 1964, too late for this book (Hesperia 23 [1964] pp.328, 335). And let me strongly commend to the reader a careful consideration of the sequence of excavations and publications (pp.15-22, 179- 87). Much time may be wasted over apparent contradictions if one fails to recognize the con- tinuity of Mycenaean studies. Apropos of this, Fig. 33, a plan of the Palace of Nestor, is not really "after Wace and Stubbings"; it is after Blegen's excavation records. And Fig. 34, a re- construction of the great court at Mycenae, is not "after Marinatos"; Marinatos gives the credit to Wace's Mycenae, where indeed the picture is reissued after the original excavation report of the 1920's (Annual of the British School at Athens 25). These are not insignificant facts. If publishers do not have time to consider such things, authors will have to take the time to insist. JOHN L. CASKEY University of Cincinnati</page></plain_text>
