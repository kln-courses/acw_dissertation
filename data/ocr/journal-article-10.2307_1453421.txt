<plain_text><page sequence="1">DO NOACHITE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN REVELATION? BY STEVEN S. SCHWARZSCHILD (Continued from JQR April, i962) We shall return later to the question which Mendelssohn discusses what the philosophical reasons may have been because of which Maimonides demanded belief in revelation on the part of Noachites. We quote his touching letter at this point only because it again illustrates the unsuccessful search for his talmudic authority by later Jewish teachers. Jacob Emden, it is true, in his reply offers to Mendelssohn several answers to this question.27 Unlike Mendelssohn's letter which is written in the fluent alnd felicitous Hebrew of a modern Hebraist, Emden's letter is couched in the typical talmudic style of the traditional legal disquisition. And the style also reflects the content, for Emden does not actually cite sources but rather engages in casuistic deductions which in his opinion justify Maimonides' stipulation. Mendelssohn, like the Kesef Mishneh, he declares, is wrong in believing that we are dealing with a novel concept peculiar to the Rambam. In fact he proposes three solutions. i. Psalm 9: i8 states: "The wicked shall return to the netherworld, even all the nations that forget God." Thus not only the sinners but even those gentiles who live moral lives but who forget God or do not believe in Him are condemned to perdition. 28 "Even if they fulfill all the commandments in the world it will not avail them at all because they do not know Him who commands the fulfill- ment of the commandments." This first derivation, whether substantively correct or not, can hardly be regarded as Maimonides' authority. It is, in the first place, a much 27 ib., p. i55, pp. I79-I83, dated Altona, November 1773. 28 Cf. Sanh. io5a. Compare also Sanhed. i07b-IIob; A both deR.

Even a Jew who performs a Mitzvah for an ulterior purpose rather than for its own sake, lishmah, is often condemned by the talmudic rabbis who exclaim that it would have been better had he never been born. They even go so far as to declare that "a sin committed for its own sake is better than a good deed for an ulterior motive." Now, to do a good deed for its own sake means, Emden says, to do it "because it is God's com- mandment, because He instituted it and ordained that His will be obeyed in this fahion." If this is true for a Jew, how much more must it be true for a non-Jew; but a non-Jew who fulfills the Noachite laws without knowing that they constitute the revealed will of God is obviously incapable of complying with this requirement. 3. Those Jewish theologians who hold that "the commandments must always be performed with the proper intention" (kavanah) would clearly have to take the same position which Maimonides represents, for one cannot have the proper intention unless one knows what the goal of the intention is to be, towit God. But even according to the school which believes that "the performance of the commandments does not require the possession of the proper intentions" (operans operandi) a Noachite must be expected to believe in the revealed origin of the Noachite laws, for the rabbinic dispensation for those who fulfill the law without the proper intention only applies to Jews. It applies to them because two good results may be expected to be achieved by the Jew who abides by the law without doing it for the right reason: in the first place, "from fulfilling the law for the wrong reason he may learn to fulfill it for the right reason," and by being punished for fulfilling the law inade- 29 It might be added that R. Jacob picks one of two views to be found in Abodah Zarah 65a quite arbitrarily.</page><page sequence="3">32 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW quately he will learn his lesson and in the future fullfil] it adequately. Neither of these good results can be expected from the unbeliever, for "there is not faith in him." Both these results rest on the premise that he who fulfills the law at least believes in God and His law, though he may not fulfill it for this reason, but a person who does not even believe in divine revelation can hardly be brought to fulfill the law with this fact in mind. He will do it "only for his own advant- age and pleasure ... All the justice and kindness which idolators practice are sinful, because they act in this manner only in order to magnify themselves... and so that their temporal rule may be lengthened." 30 The only credit which Jacob Emden is willing to concede to them is that they may be able to obtain earthly credit, but they are certainly not entitled, he concludes, to "a share in the world to come." Now, whatever one may think of the religious or Jewish validity of R. Jacob's argument, one thing seems clear: the latter two reasons are not in their very nature sources or authorities; they are arguments to buttress Maimonides' position, both revolving around the indispensability of proper intention in the performance of religious law. For all we krnow at this point Maimonides might even have agreed with the reasoning which he follows, but such reasoning does not constitute literary or legal authority. Certainly Mendels- sohn, for example, must have remained completely uncon- vinced by R. Jacob Emden's reply. Their extant correspon- dence ends at this point, but we can easily imagine what Mendelssohn's reaction must have been: in the first place, he will have said to himself that lots of men believe in God and may even act morally for God's sake without necessarily believing in the divine authority of the Torah; in the second place, he will have answered that the very purpose of the Noachite laws as the natural law valid for all human beings 30 Cf. Midr. Prov. XIV, 34 f., 38b. Unless carefully read Mai- monides' letter to R. Hasdai (cf. p. 24a) might seem to support R. Jacob's justification in terms of "the heart's intention."</page><page sequence="4">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 33 is precisely to provide an avenue of salvation for those who do not happen to be heirs to the Jewish tradition, and, therefore, all the deductions made from this tradition cannot -be believed to be valid for them. We must then conclude that also R. Jacob Emden was unable to supply an answer to the question from where Maimonides received the talmudic authority for his statement. We must furthermore conclude, -in the absence of other proposed solutions, that the Kesef .Mishneh was right in the first place: Maimonides added the Noachite requirement of belief in the divine authority of the Torah on his own accord. Or, if one is ready to concede that these sources may after all constitute Maimonides' authority, the problem is merely pushed one step backwards: why did Maimonides use these sources to come to his controversial conclusion when so many other Jewish interpreters who were no less acquainted with them did not utilize them for any such purpose ? If our conclusion is correct, the second question which we must ask of Maimonides gains even further in importance: -what were his reasons for this dictum ? Two reasons which were suggested by Hermann Cohen in -his polemic against Spinoza must be ruled out. He suggested in the first place that we must weigh the two formulations of the principle that "the righteous men of the nations of the world have a share in the world to come" in which the addi- tional requirement is not mentioned against the one place -in which this controversial sentence does occur and implies -that the latter is, therefore, of little if any consequence. 31 This is false reasoning. The two sentences in "The Laws of Repentance" and "The Laws of Testimony" may not expli- citly state the additional requirement, but there is nothing in these two clauses which contradicts the third. In them Maimonides merely repeats that the "righteous of the nations have a share in the world to come," but he does not explain what constitutes such righteous men. It is perfectly consistent 31 IOc. Cit., p. 348. 3</page><page sequence="5">34 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW for him in "The Laws of the Kings" to define what a righteous man of the nations is and then to let the student conclude that it is a person so defined who is referred to in the other two contexts. Furthermore, we must hold in mind the principle which Leo Strauss 32 lays down. Strauss assigns his place to Maimonides in the tradition of esoteric writing in which, during much of antiquity, the Middle Ages, and even in modern times, thinkers who believed that their somewhat unconventional beliefs might draw upon them the wrath of priests, rulers, or mob disguised their views in such a manner that, even while they expressed their doctrines sufficiently clearly for the comprehension of the initiates, the general reader would be oblivious to their true opinions. One of the rules of this kind of Aesopian style is, then, formulated by Strauss thus: "We may establish the rule that of two contra- dictory statements in the Guside or in any other work of Maimonides that statement which occurs least frequently or even which occurs only once was considered by him to be true." Cohen's attempt, then, to justify a virtual omission of the debated clause must be rejected for these two reasons. Cohen's second explanation of Maimonides' disturbing dictum must also be rejected. For he claims that in the two former instances Maimonides speaks generally of Noachites of whom no requirement is made beyond the seven Noachite laws, wvhile in the statement at issue he speaks of a specific kind of Noachite, namely the ger toshav, i.e. the resident stranger-convert who is a citizen of the Jewish state. This type of gentile, now, Cohen goes on to argue, had to give some additional guarantee that he would always remain a loyal and obedient member of the Jewish society. If he agreed to the ethics of the Noachite covenant by virtue of his own reason alone he might at some future time change his mind for to him equally cogent rational reasons and thus become sub- versive of civil obedience and peace. This contingency could be prevented only by ascertaining that his submission to the 32 Persecution and the Art of Writing, Glencoe, Ill., I952, p. 73.</page><page sequence="6">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCIHILD 35 Noachite laws was grounded in a more lasting reason than his own calculations, namely a divine command in whose validity he believed. 33 There is only one thing wrong with this argument of Cohen's: even if his distinction between "the righteous man of the nations of the world" on the one hand and the "resident stranger-convert" on the other is correct, even if his definition of what talmudic law had in mind in the concept of the ger-toshav is valid, 3 the wording of Maimonides' disputed statement makes it indubitably clear that he regards the person who does not believe in the divine origin of the Noachite laws in the Torah not only as no resident convert-stranger but also as no "righteous man of the nations of the world"': "''., then he is not a resident stranger-convert nor one of the righteous men of the nations of the world but one of their sages," and only the righteous men of the gentile nations have their share in the world to come. But this is precisely the point which in Cohen's argu- ment is completely missed: even granting Cohen's ascription of political motives to the refusal to let a man persuaded of the validity of the Noachite laws by his own reason be considered a stranger-convert, Maimonides also refuses to consider him as morally and religiously a righteous member of the gentile nations from the point of view of Jewish law and denies him eternal salvation,-and this latter point is what disturbs so many readers of this passage. 3 33 bOC. cit., p. 349; Religion der Vernunft, p. 386. 34 and Benamozegh, op. cit., p. 6i8 would seem to support him on this point; also the discussion on p. 596. Also Michael Guttmann, Das Judentum und Seine Umwelt, Berlin I927, pp. 52, 59, IIO. 35 How the term "Noachite" differs from the term "resident- convert" Maimonides himself defines and in such a manner as to invalidate this argument of Cohen's: "Who is a resident-convert? A gentile who has taken upon himself not to engage in idolatry together with the other commandments which are obligatory for Noachites, eventhough he is neither circumcized nor baptized; behold, him we accept, and he is one of the righteous men of the nations of the world." (Cf. also A bodah Zara 64b; "Laws of Forbidden Marriages," ch. 14: 7) In other words, a resident-convert is a Noachite who fulfills the obligations of a Noachite.-This passage in Hilchot Issure</page><page sequence="7">36 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Cohen is, of course, an interested party in this dispute. He has three reasons for not wanting to believe that Maimo- nides could possibly have said what clearly he does say. In the first place, Cohen had unbounded admniration for Maimo- nides. He regards him as the by far most outstanding Jewish thinker of all times; he discusses his writings and quotes Bi'ah goes on to make the famous and controversial statement that "resident-converts are accepted only in the time when the law of the Jubilee year is practiced," not now-which is to say, only in messianic times. (Cf. Arakin 29) The Rabad, of course, disputes this view and would restrict the acceptability of resident-converts at the present only to the extent that certain privileges which would devolve upon them in messianic times they could not now enjoy. (ad locum) If Maimonides' original statement were to be left as it first seems to present itself, the clear implication would be that only in messianic times can there be practicing Noachites, and that then the belief in Revelation would also be pre-requisite would presumably be not so much a demand as a self-evident assumption. On the other hand, it is hard to believe that Maimonides could have held that until messianic times no gentile could be "righteous." Perhaps the solution of this problem lies in Maimonides' exact wording. Ch. I4 : 7 declares: "Why is a resident-convert called 'resident?' Because we may settle him among ourselves in the Land of Israel." I4: 8 then immediately goes on: "We do not accept a resident-convert other than in messianic times." It is possible, now, that the acceptance mentioned does not refer to the acceptance of resident-converts as such but rather more limitedly to the acceptance of his full residence-rights in Palestine which is discussed immediately previous to this sentence. (This is also true because conversion in messianic times must be suspected of ulterior, materialistic motives and would, therefore, violate I3: I4.) This would then coincide with what Rabad calls the "strict" of the two-according to him-possible explanations. And this also sounds logical, because the practice of the Jubilee year implies residence in Palestine and economic prosperity, whereas in the conditions of exilic distress and poverty residence in Palestine is impossible by definition, and economic help is difficult. This solution would further seem to be supported by the fact that the legislation concerning Noachites is placed by Maimonides in the "Laws of the Kings" immediately prior to, and, therefore, presumably connected with, the last two chapters (ii and I2) which deal with the definition of the messianic Kingdom. In the very last law of ch. io concerned with Noachites, a few words before the discussion of the Messiah begins, Maimonides re-iterates: "for behold, we are commanded to support the resident- converts." This, then-not the acceptance of resident-converts as such-is the messianic aspect of Noachitism.</page><page sequence="8">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 37 him more often than any other Jewish authority. And Cohen, therefore, is afflicted with the same problem which already Mendelssohn suffered: how could this greatest of all Jewish spokesmen teach a doctrine which neither of them could believe on the basis of their own understanding of Judaism as a rational and thoroughly tolerant faith, on the basis of their own endeavors to bridge the gap between Jews and their non-Jewish fellow-Europeans, and on the basis of their own philosophical systems of ethics and truth? The second reason why Hermann Cohen could not, as it were, believe his eyes when he saw Maimonides' dictum in "The Laws of the Kings," chapter 8, II, is that in his own system of philosophical religious ethics the Jewish concept of the Noachite as the ethical man pleasing to God purely on the basis of natural, rational moral law without religious commitment holds foremost place of pride and glory. The concept of man as possessing inherent dignity and value, regardless of race, nation, creed, or social status,-the uni- versal dignity of human beings as the cornerstone of moral philosophy and social progress-, this concept Cohen rightly believed to have been achieved by Biblical Judaism. Neither the loftiest height of Greek philosophy with its distinction between natural-born slaves and barbarians nor the wide sway of Roman imperial sovereignty over many different nations and religions produced this concept so fundamental to the increasing freedom and welfare of the human race. Only the Bible recognized the dignity of all human beings. "Messianic mankind," Cohen proclaims, "was foreshadowed in the stranger who has equal rights." 36 "This is the great step with which humanity begins, and it begins in the form of law and state, although this state is based on the One God, and although this alien does not profess Him." 37 That Mai- monides should infringe upon this universal concept is incre- dible to Cohen. 36 bOc. cit., P. 345. 37 Religion der Verxnuft, p. I4I.</page><page sequence="9">38 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Finally, Cohen knew very well that Spinoza used this passage in the Mishneh Torah, as we shall see shortly, in one of his most virulent attacks on Judaism. And Spinoza was the arch-enemy to Hermann Cohen. Spinoza taught not only that nature is God rather than that God is the author of morality, he not only libeled Judaism, he identified right with might, denied freedom,- he also advocated submission to rather than conquest of reality. 38 Spinoza's attack on Maimonides and through Maimonides on Judaism as a whole had to be annihilated at all costs. We shall also have to refute Spinoza, but Cohen's refutation by vindicating Maimonides on this score does not succeed. Another reason that has occasionally been adduced for Maimonides' position is that he held not only morality but piety, i.e. religious devotion based on religious belief, to be prerequisite to salvation, for Jews as well as for non-Jews. Though this terminological evidence does not seem to be mentioned in this connection, it is, of course, striking that the word usually translated as "righteous man" (chassid) means more than merely the good man; it is often in other connec- tions translated as saint or pietist and is derived from the divine quality of chesed or grace. Thus, for example, the mediaeval Al-Ashkar 39 interprets the Maimonidean passage to imply that not primarily philosophical wisdom but religious piety is the criterion for divine acceptability. Dr. Sonne similarly expressed himself: Maimonides, he says, held that belief in torat moshe misinai, the divine Mosaic revelation, was indispensable to salvation. This is the religious equivalent of his philosophical tenet that right beliefs are prerequisite to immortality. Now, this is obviously true; it merely re-states what Maimonides says in other words in the passage under 38 Cf. the famous essay "Ueber Staat und Religion, Judentum und Christentum," and many other places throughout Cohen's writings; Ernst Simon, "Zu H. Cohens Spinoza-Au_flassung," MGWdJ, vol. 79, 2, Breslau I935, pp. I8I-I94; Schwarzschild, "The Democratic Socialism of H. Cohen," HUCA, vol. XXVII, pp. 42I f. 39 loc. cit.</page><page sequence="10">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 39 consideration. On the other hand, it does not help us much in understanding why Maimonides held this view. A letter from Maimonides to R. Hasdai LaLevy, the Spaniard (of Egypt), residing in Alexandria, is extant in which the writer also refers to this problem: 40 "As for what you ask about the gentile nations, you must know that God asks for the heart, and things go according to the heart's intent- ion. 41 Therefore, the sages of truth, our rabbis, may they rest in peace, said: 'the righteous of the gentile nations of the world have a share in the world-to-come'-if they have attained to that which it is proper to attain of the knowledge of the Creator, blessed be He. .. There is no doubt that everyone who has improved his soul with the propriety of the virtues and with the propriety of wisdom in the faith in the Creator, blessed be He, is certainly among the children of the world-to-come, and therefore the sages of truth, our rabbis, may they rest in peace, said: 'even a gentile, when he busies himself with the Torah of Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, is like unto the highpriest.' . . . There can also be no doubt that the patriarchs and Noah and Adam, who did not keep any of the words of the Torah, were not children of hell; rather, when they reached and attained to that to which it is proper to progress, they certainly were in the high sphere." 42 40 Iggerot haRambam, Leipzig I859, vol. II, pp. 23 f. Prof. Altmann kindly brought this passage to my attention. Guttmann, op. cit., p. I57 also mentions it, and Mendelssohn refers to it. (cf. note ii) Maimonides, in this letter, refers to the Guide; it must, therefore, have been written later. 41 Cf. Sanhed. io6b; Ber. I5af. Cf. also Bernhard Heller, "'Gott wuenscht das Heyz:' Legenden ueber Einfaeltige A ndacht und ueber den Gefaehrten im Paradies," HUCA IV, I927, pp. 365-404. 42 Comp. the Christian doctrine of the descent into hell to save these very personages: "descendit ad inferos."

He does not say so in so many words, but he clearly leaves room for his doctrine that "the virtues" can be acquired only through revelation. The Historic Qu/estion WVe turn then to, the most important question that arises out of Maimonides' famous statement. Why did he have to make it in the context of his philosophical theology? What is its place in his system ? In the attempt to answer this question we may begin with the observation earlier quoted from Mendelssohn's letter to R. Jacob Emden, that for Maimonides the recognition of good and evil was not a matter of the rational intelligence but rather of convention or statutory enactment. If this is so, Mendelssohn rightly argues, then a man who claims that he believes in the morality of the Noachite laws is not to be taken seriously, is certainly not to be relied on in the long run, for he believes in a morality which he has attained by false and illogical reasoning. And this, of course, correctly represents Maimonides' view of the matter. In his Treatise on Logic 43 he proposes that among the judgments which are known to be true without further evidence are, in the first place, "conventions" (concens'/s gentilil/tm, mefursamot) such as "our knowledge of the fact that sexual unchastity is repulsive and that repaying someone who has benefacted us as much as we can is appropriate and right," and, in the second place, "traditions, that is anything accepted from a chosen person or from many chosen persons." It is to be noted that moral cognition as exemplified in chastity and gratitude is couched in esthetic terminology, as to this day it is commonly held that what is beautiful and ugly is a matter of personal, subjective taste. If there are to be then 43 Ed. Israel Efros, N.Y. I938, ch. 8, PP. 39 f-Hebrew part.</page><page sequence="12">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 4I generally accepted standards of this kind of knowledge, they cannot be arrived at by logical excogitations but rather must be attained by conventions agreed upon by any given society, bequeathed to it by past practices, or imposed by divine or human statutes. And this is exactly what the Rambam in his philosophical ethic teaches. In the Guide to the Perplexed, Part I, the entire second chapter is in effect devoted to this question. Maimonides begins by interpreting the Biblical verse "And you will become like God in that you will know good and evil" (Gen. 3: 5) very discreetly and ingeniously to mean that only God, and anyone who is like God, can discern good and evil. This knowledge, in other words, is a divine prerogative not properly bestowed upon the human intelligence. "With the reason man distinguishes between truth and falsehood, (this is an intellectual operation) . . . but the repulsive and the lovely (and we have already seen that Maimonides identifies moral categories with esthetic ones) are conventions, not rational concepts ... Thus in our lan- guage we speak of that which is right and that which is not right as truth and falsehood, but of that which is ugly or lovely we speak as good or bad." Again later in the same chapter he declares: "For the necessary, intellectual existent there is no goodness or evil, only truth and falsehood." In other words, for God the moral and the immoral are not questions of goodness or evil but of rightness and wrongness; it is only for man, with his limited intelligence, that such problems cannot be resolved with intellectual, scientific finality but rather are dependent on less definite judgments which, just because of their indefiniteness, require positive enjoinments for their completion. This view of Maimonides is, of course, an integral part of his Aristotelian inheritance. Aristotle taught: 44 "Now fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist only by convention and not by nature. 44 Nichomachean Ethics, I, Io94b, I4-23.</page><page sequence="13">42 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW And goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth and others by reason or their courage. We must be content, then, of speaking of such subjects and with such premises to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking about things which are only for the most part true and with premises of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better." This view is shared by Maimonides. He teaches in many places that when it comes to ethics and proper human actions the intelligence can only indicate the general direction, set the broad outline, but the details and specifics which are so important if the general principles are to have any meaning whatsoever must be provided by authorities other than reason. This position is concisely summarized in the very clause which follows immediately upon the controverted clause in the eighth chapter of the "Laws of the Kings" and which strikingly is meant to explain it, though it never seems to have been put together with it by the commentators: 45 So far as the six of the seven Noachite laws are concerned that were given already to Adam, "although the reason inclines toward them, it is from the words of the Torah that we learn that they were commanded to him." 46 An analogy can be drawn between Maimonides' position on this score and his view on the first of the 6I3 command- ments. It is well-known that in his Book of tle Commandments he lists as the first of the positive commandments the one which enjoins belief in God. This enumeration has often been 45 ch. 9: I. 46 And it should perhaps be added that Hermann Cohen who was understandably so put out by the original restriction of the definition of a Noachite, rationalist that he is, does not like this Maimonidean view of the inadequate rationality of ethics any better and exerts himself to comment that this view of Maimonides implies no derogation of the autonomy of morality but a high estimate of the rigorousness of reason. ("Charakteristik der Ethik Maimunis," pp. 8i-88, Moses ben Maimon, Sein Leben, Sein Werk, Und Sein Einfluss, eds. W. Bacher etc., Leipzig I908).</page><page sequence="14">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 43 disputed. For example the Great Book of the Laws (Sefer Halachot Gedolot), Zohar HaRakia (cf. Megillat Esther ad loc.) and Nachmanides take the position that this is not to be counted among the 6I3 commandments; rather that it is the foundation of all the other commandments and cannot, therefore, be regarded as itself one of them. But this is preci- sely why Maimonides does include it. All the other command- ments are dependent for their validity upon this one, and it must, therefore, be put at the very head of the list. Simi- larly, the fulfillment of the seven Noachite laws is in his judgment dependent on belief in he authority and commu- nication of their Author, and Hermann Cohen's objection, that adding this requirement to the Noachite laws is tant- amount to adding an eighth, 47 is no more cogent from Maimonides' point of view than the objection of those who do not wish to see the belief in God included among the total list of 6I3 commandments. Finally this circumstance must be taken cognizance of in this connection: in chapter IO, 9 of the "Laws of the Kings" Maimonides states: "The basic principle of this entire matter is that it is not permitted to create a new religion and to make laws by oneself out of one's own thinking, but rather a gentile must either become a convert (ger tzedek) and take upon himself all the commandments or he may retain his original faith, and then he must neither add to nor detract fromi it." On the basis of the principle implied in this clause the most interesting modern book on Noachitism was written, Elie Benamozegh's Israel et L'Humanite', Paris I9I4, a book, it might be added, which was more than a book in that at least in France it brought about a small but important movement of Christian conversions to Noachism. 48 Funda- mental to this study is the theory that Noachism is the religion of the gentiles taught by Judaism, itself the religion and the laws of the Jews. In the time especially of the birth of Christia- 47 bOc. Cit., P. 350. 48 Cf. the introduction by Aim6 Palliere.</page><page sequence="15">44 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW nity there existed two tendencies each of which contradicted this theory by attempting to overcome the ethnic particu- larism of Judaism in an opposite manner: there was the Paulinian attitude which wanted to broaden the vaJidity of Judaism by abolishing its legal requirements not only for gentiles but also for Jews; and then there was the prose- lytizing attitude among Jews which intended to apply the law not only to Jews but to all men. 49 But the two, Judaism and Noachism, must be kept apart and integral. Only in this way will the truth of Judaism eventually come to benefit all mankind without on the other hand impinging on the sanctity of Judaism or of the Jewish people. Noachism, then, from this perspective is what might be called "the out-patient department" of Judaism, rather than the natural law which exists outside and independent of Judaism. 50 For that reason also belief in God and in the revelation of the Torah to Israel is indispensable to the legitimate Noachite. It has been previously mentioned that Spinoza lets loose a vitriolic attack on Maimonides for several reasons, our passage being one of the most prominent in the Theologico- Political Tractlte. An analysis of Spinoza's polemic against Maimonides' view on this question shall, therefore, represent the last episode in our review of the checkered and agitated history of this controversial clause. That Spinoza should heartily disagree with everything about this dictum in the Mishneh Torah and with all its implications cannot come as a surprise. We have seen, in the first place, that the basic philosophical reason which compelled Maimonides to take this restrictive position toward the 49 Cf. p. 22 f. 50 ib., p. 483. At first glance it might appear that the established doctrine that "he who is commanded to do and does is better than he who is not commanded to do and does" (Tosefta, Abodah Zarah 8 4-8, H. Talmud Torah I: I3) might here explain Maimonides' position, but this is not the case, for the Noachites are, after all, commanded the seven Noachite commandments. (Cf. Isaac Heineman, Ta'ame HaMitzvot BeSafrut Yisrael, Jerusalem I949, vol. I, p. 25 and notes).</page><page sequence="16">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 45 Noachites was the fact that he had learned from his teacher Aristotle and was ready also for religious reasons to believe that ethics are not a purely rational, philosophic or scientific discipline. Only the barest outline of general ethical principles can be defined by logical methods. The substance of the matter which resides in its details can be obtained only through positive statutes, traditions, or divine commands, none of which are produced by conscious, rational processes. This was the reason, as we have seen, that Noachites could not be trusted to adhere to a system of morality at which they had arrived by philosophic considerations. Now, to the con- trary, if Spinoza's system stands for anything it stands for the exactly opposite position, namely that ethics are a purely logical and scientific set of principles which can be elaborated in the smallest details. Indeed, the very title of his major work states as much: "Ethics, demonstrated in a geometric manner;" that is to say, from a small group of fundamental premises, similar to mathematical axioms, by means of logical deductions an entire consistent and adequate system of morality can be developed, even as every mathematical result can be obtained on the basis of the original theses and by means of strictly logical analyses. Thus on the fundamental premise of the very nature of what ethics are Maimonides and Spinoza are worlds apart, and it cannot, therefore, take anyone by surprise that they would violently disagree. This wide divergency also expresses itself, of course, on the level of the more specific aspects of the actual content of ethics. Thus where Maimonides teaches, as we again have seen earlier, that ethics, in order to take on human and livable form, requires a divine addendum in the shape of actual imperatives,-that ethics must necessarily be religious ethics and involve a definite religious commitment, (for all this is clearly involved in the prerequisite of belief in the divine revelation of the Torah)-, Spinoza to the contrary teaches that any rational human being can evolve his own valid moral outlook. Furthermore, according to Spinoza, who</page><page sequence="17">46 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW himself, of course, adhered to neither Judaism nor Christia- nity, submitting to the doctrinal or ethical yoke of a religious communion is by no means indispensable to the moral man. Anyone who practices "the virtues of charity, joy, peace, etc., whether he do so by reason of Scripture or on the basis of his own reason, is in effect taught of God." 51 Thus Spinoza strongly disagrees with Maimonides on the nature of ethics generally and on the indispensability of belief in divine revelation for the validity of ethics in particu- lar. He must, therefore, firmly reject the clause in the "Laws of the Kings" which we have been discussing. And this he does. He goes one step further, however. He writes 52 that "according to Judaism," not just according to Maimonides, a Noachite must accept the authenticity of the Torah, and he then goes on to quote the disputed passage in its entirety and in its unemended formulation. There are two questions which must be considered in this connection: i) Why does Spinoza attribute Maimonides' view on this question to all of Judaism, whereas, as we have seen, many of the most outstanding spokesmen of Judaism them- selves dissented sharply from it? 2) Was he justified and sincere in quoting the text from the Mis/mnel Toralt in its strongest and almost certainly false form? So far as the second question is concerned, Joel 53 points out that Spinoza does not limit himself to quoting Maimonides but also refers to the little booklet Kevod Eloltim in which this Maimonidean doctrine is alluded to and supported. Now it happens that this passage as quoted in this book occurs there not in the corrupt form in which we have it in our extant editions but rather in the correct form, reading "but of their sages" rather than "and not of their sages." It follows then that Spinoza who used this book must have known of the correct text and willfully used the incorrect one in order 51 Theologico-Political Tractate, p. 8o. 52 loc. cit. 53 Spinozas Theologisch-Politisches Traktat-auf seine Quellen ge- prueft, Breslau I870, p. 56.</page><page sequence="18">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 47 to incriminate Judaism more gravely. (Hermann Cohen quotes this argument of Joel's who, incidentally, had been a teacher of his during his student-days and adds that the correct text is also used in the commentary,-he must mean either the Kesef Mishneh or the Lechem Mishneh-,and that, therefore, Spinoza maliciously disregarded two pieces of evidence rather than one, but this is not true; these commen- taries do not contain the original and correct wording.54) This circumstance alone, then, ought to make us suspicious of the cleanliness of Spinoza's motivation and of his methods of argumentation in this controversy. As to the former question, why Spinoza went out of his way in order to give the general non-Jewish public to which his Tractate was addressed the impression that Maimonides' individual and certainly somewhat eccentric view authori- tatively represented the concensus of Jewish opinion on this subject, Leo Strauss believes that this is a piece of what he indulgently calls "amazing rashness." Strauss proceeds to criticize Spinoza for it and ascribes it to the "irrelevant reason that he (Spinoza) had happened to study it closely in his youth." 55 On the other hand, we must hold more with Joel who believed that Spinoza acted in this fashion not just out of sincere though perhaps erroneous rashness and in honest ignorance of his mistake but out of a conscious and intentional desire to identify Judaism publicly with the one man who on this point happened to be the most "dogmatic" thinker. 56 In other words, we are making the claim that Spinoza knowingly and libelously distorted Jewish doctrine. And our reasons for believing this are three: In the first place, we have already seen that Spinoza must be held guilty of consciously having chosen a quotation in a text which he was aware to be corrupt just because it displayed the Jewish view on this question in an even crasser light than would have been the case otherwise. In the second place, 54 Cf. |oc. Cit., p. 347. 55 op. cit., p. I98. 56 op. cit., p.

Thus, for example, he denies to the more highly developed religions the right to engage in Biblical exegesis and insists that the Bible must be either taken literally or not at all. The anthro- pomorphisms which occur in the Bible, therefore, may not be understood in any metaphoric or theological sense but must either be believed ot they must lead to a rejection of the concept of God as it is embodied in the Bible. And it is on the ground that Maimonides is, of course, the most out- standing Jewish interpreter who dissolved all forms of anthropomorphisms in as well as outside of the Bible by his theological exegesis that Spinoza polemicizes against him even much more vitriolically and frequently than on the ground of his statement in the eighth chapter of the "Laws of- the Kings." 57 The point of this entire harangue is not, obviously, that Spinoza wants people to believe that God has anthropomorphic attributes but rather that he wishes them to reject the Bible, and he can accomplish this purpose in no better manner than by insisting on the literal significance of Biblical texts. Thus he reduces the Bible to its most primi- tive level in order on this level the more easily to be able to reject it. This is what we have called reductio ad barbarum, and this is also the willful method which he utilizes in his argument against Maimonides' Noachite legislation: by identifying all of Judaism with its most radical expression he expects people to discard it the more eagerly. The third, last, and most cogent reason for believing that Spinoza intentionally misrepresented Judaism by ascribing 57 Cf. especially Tractate, pp. I I5 f.: "The falsity of such a doctrine is shown, ... for we have shown both by reason and by example that the meaning of Scripture is only made plain through Scripture itself. . . Therefore, the method of Maimonides is clearly useless ... In conclusion, then, we dismiss Maimonides' theory as harmful, useless, and absurd."</page><page sequence="20">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 49 Maimonides' view on this question to all of Jewish law is the fact that a doctrine which would exclude non-Jews from all forms of moral or social approbation fits in perfectly with the thoroughly untrue picture of Judaism which Spinoza is at pains throughout the Tractlte to paint. It is a picture so flagrantly in contrast to the truth that there is even no need to refute it; merely to reproduce it is sufficient for any impartial reader to be convinced of its falsehood. For Spinoza claims that Judaism is profoundly xenophobic. Its religious rites and rituals have been devised primarily in order to distinguish Jews from non-Jews, in order, in this manner, to keep them apart and preserve them as a separate entity, and it is this fact which accounts for the history of anti- semitism, for naturally gentiles have reacted to this Jewish xenophobia by reciprocating Jewish hatred. 58 Although Jewish religious ritual was established exclusively in order through it to mold Jews more tightly together and to strengthen their loyalty to the Jewish state, the Pharisees perpetuated it even after the destruction of the state in order to differen- tiate Jews from Chiistians. 59 "Nurtured by daily rites ... the hatred of other nations ... must have passed into their nature. Such daily reprobation naturally gave rise to a lasting hatred, deeply implanted in the heart: for of all hatreds none are more deep and tenacious than that which springs from extreme devoutness or piety and it is cherished as pious." 60 Again and again he comes back to this theme: Jewish patriotism is strengthened by a religiously indoctrina- ted hatred of others, contempt for all gentile fellowmen and by the singularity of one's own religion. 61 In his more ora- torical moments Spinoza goes one step further. He exclaims that the very God in whose existence he does not believe, a God who can give laws and revelations, imposed religious and ritual laws upon the Jews "in his anger" in order to make sure that Jews would be held in contempt and hatred 58 op. cit., p. 55. 59 ib., p. 72. 60 ib., p. 229. 61 ib., pp. 230 f. 4</page><page sequence="21">50 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW by their neighbors and thus would not be able to preserve their own existence and the existence of their state in the face of the enmity to which they would necessarily be expo- sed. 62 Here he thus discreetly alludes to the Hoseanic passage which states that God gave kings to Israel "in His anger." Indeed, Spinoza continues and now echoes Paul, their laws are a constant reminder to the Jews of their defilement and their divine rejection. 63 How ideally into this mythical picture of Judaism Spinoza's version and interpretation of Maimonides' restrictive legis- lation concerning Noachites fits. It too seems to declare that, Judaism teaches that non-Jews, people who do not believe in the divinity of the Torah, are incapable of salvation,-that indeed, they cannot even be moral. No wonder, then, that Spinoza wants to believe that Maimonides made this point as stringently as possible and that he legitimately represented all of the Judaism which Spinoza wanted so pathetically to reject and to defame. The Systematic Question One important aspect of the problem remains to be studied, and perhaps it is the most important. Having established as far as we could what Maimonides said and why he said it, we must ask ourselves what the philosophic and religious truth is which is, also from our point of view today, embodied in his doctrine on this question. It can fairly be claimed that the fundamental problem clearly involved in the dispute between Maimonides and Spinoza is the problem of the possibility and validity of the concept of natural law. Both philosophers ask themselves within the context of their respective systems whether there is such a thing as a moral law which is known to and applied by all men, regardless of whether they are Jews or gentiles, whether they have been given the special boon of divine 62 ib., p. 232. 63 ib., p. 233.</page><page sequence="22">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 5I guidance or not, and regardless of the time and the place in which they live, merely in their capacity of human beings. The traditional term for such a law is "natural law." That for Maimonides the question of the Noachite laws was synonymous with the question of natural law can be seen, apart from the general considerations which we have just entertained, in several ways. The Noachite laws in Judaism are known by this name precisely because, all men having perished in Noah's flood, all mankind after Noah must have descended from the only survivor of the flood. Thus Noah is, as it were, a second Adam, the forefather of all human beings, and the laws which devolve upon him and his descen- dants, therefore, apply to all nations, races, and religions. Maimonides emphasizes this fact by stressing that actually of the seven so-called Noachite laws six were given to Adam and only the seventh was added in the time of Noah, thus underlining the universal, "adamic" human nature of these laws, 64 although the Talmud records some rabbis who attributed as little as one Noachitic law to Adam. 65 And he inserts the statement that "the reason inclines toward these laws" after enumerating the adamic laws, before pro- ceeding to the Noachite one. The latter and thus all of the fundamental ethical imperatives, he ends with the phrase: "Thus was it in all the world until Abraham came,"-and then, of course, various additional Jewish commandments were issued. The identification of Noachite law with natural law for Maimonides can further be realized when two corrolary sources are compared with him. Also for Averroes, whom, of course, Maimonides knew very well, natural law "corres- ponded roughly to the Second Tablet of the Decalogue but included the command of divine worship," 66 and such a list coincides almost completely with the Noachite list.

For him, too, this is the problem of natural law. All law, indeed all ethics were, of course, nature for him on the grounds of the famous doctrine of deus sive natura. It, therefore, really goes without saying that for him also the issue to be debated was whether there is or there is not such a law which all men, qua men, can know and by which they can attain to the highest good. That Spinoza was concerned with the question of natural law even in the narrower sense of the word can, however, also be demonstrated with historical evidence. We know that he had the work of Hugo Grotius, the acknowledged founder of the modern theory of natural law and an older contemporary and compatriot of his, in his library. 68 Also for Grotius the same distinction between revealed and natural law existed which we have stipulated as differentiating Mosaic from Noachitic law: positive divine (universal) law was embodied in the Decalogue, whereas the gospels, the Christian equivalent of the Torah, were only applicable to their recipients, Christians. 69 If the issue, then, is the issue of natural law, what is it that is described by this term? The simplest and certainly also the worst concept of natural law is that concept according to which moral behaviour should be or is conducted by following the behavior of animate or 67 Summa, I, qu.

This idea has been enunciated at various times in the history of philosophy. To the greco-Roman cynics this was the fundamental criterion of ethics, and since they conceded that by social standards the actions of nature would have to be judged as at best a-moral they concluded that the moral man and moral society should also act in this fashion. Under the influence of the biological doctrine of evolution such a philosophy of ethics became popular again toward the end of the igth century. The advocates of evolutionist ethics proclaimed that even as nature progresses through the processes of the struggle for survival and the survival of the fittest, so also society in its individual as well as its collective aspects would progress toward increased goodness by adhering to these principles. There is more than a little of this belief also to be found in Spinoza. The most characteristic passage in his writings which expresses this point of view is to be found in the Theologico-Political Tract ate: "By the right and ordinance of nature I merely mean those natural laws wherewith we conceive every individual to be conditioned by nature, so as to live and act in a given manner. For instance, fishes are naturally conditioned for swimming and the greater for de- vouring the less; therefore, fish enjoy the water and the greater devour the less by natural right. For it is certain that nature, taken in the abstract, has sovereign right to do anything that she can; i.e. her right is co-extensive with her power. The power of nature is the power of God, which has sovereign right over all things; and inasmuch as the power of nature is simply the aggregate of the powers of all her individual components, it follows that every individual has sovereign right to do all that he can; i.e. the rights of an individual extend to the utmost limits of his power as it has been condi- tioned. Now it is the sovereign right and law of nature that each individual should endeavour to preserve itself as it is, without regard to anything but itself." 70 70 p. 200.</page><page sequence="25">54 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In the second place, there is that view of the law of nature which derives moral law not so much from external nature as rather from "human nature," what the Thomists call natura humana. 71 In classic philosophy this position was represented by the Stoa. It believed that by analyzing the essential nature of man and determining what his highest good is it would be possible to deduce the principles of indi- vidual behavior and of social organization which would best serve this aim. If the cynical-evolutionist interpretation of the doctrine of natural law almost refutes itself by wiping out all differences between brute nature and humanity, by declaring that man ought to do what he is doing, i.e. ethics is not normative but descriptive, then the stoic-Thomist interpretation makes a number of assumptions which in turn cannot be maintained. In the first place, it assumes that human nature is static, determined once and for all everywhere and at all times. "Human nature is the same in all men," postulates Jaques Maritain. 72 But this is not only an unprovable theory; it is the epitome of all moral and social reaction, for it stipulates dogmatically that what man is now he must always remain, and thus it makes itself the philosophical tool of all those who have always resisted human progress by pointing to what they said was the immalleable recalcitrance of human nature. In the second place, this school of thought must always hold that there is such a thing as an essential, permanent, and reliable moral cons- cience in man. Thomas calls it the "synderesis, a natural habitus of the soul" by which good and evil are recognized for what they are, an irradiato divini intellectus. 73 Again, this is at best an unprovable claim. Certainly human ex- perience would seem to demonstrate the contrary. What crimes have not been committed in the name of conscience, 71 Cf. M. E. Schmitt, Recht und Vernunft, Ein Beitrag zu?r Dishussion ueber die Rationalitaet des Naturrechts, Heidelberg i955, p. 8. 72 The Rights of Man and Natuiral Law, N.Y. I943, p. 6o. 73 Cf. Schmitt, op. cit., pp. io5 if.</page><page sequence="26">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 55 and sincerely so! Furthermore, it dogmatically stipulates the existence of a separate moral human faculty which is rationally undeducible. When Cicero identifies the vox naturae with omnium consensus he in effect endorses this stoic position, and here again neither reason nor history justify such trust in majority agreements. The fact of the matter is that universally what people have believed in and wanted they have called "natural law," whatever were the real reasons for their preference. Be it slavery or human freedom, property or selflessness, birth-control or free love, authoritarianism or democracy, they all have at one time or another been identified by their proponents with the very substance of nature and reason. David G. Ritchie amusingly illustrates this truth when he observes that in our language a 'natural child' means a child born out of wedlock; but an 'unnatural child' is not necessarily legitimate." 74 Justice Holmes said the same thing differently: "The jurists who believe in natural law seem to me to be in that naive state of mind that accepts what has been familiar and accepted by all men everywhere." 75 From the point of view of social morality the doctrine of natural law has on balance wrought more harm than good, for it tends to deduce from the fact that something exists that it must also be according to nature,-for otherwise it would not be likely to exist in the first place-, and that it must, therefore, also be good. Thus the doctrine of natural law usually puts its stamp of approval on every given reality, however repulsive it may be. 76 It is essentially a conservative theory. Spinoza himself illustrates such an attitude based on natural law inertia: whatever form of government a nation happens to have, be it good or bad, free or tyrannical, it is 74 Natural Rights, London I895, p. 20. 75 The Holmes Reader, ed.

Keep whatever you have; what you will get through a change can at best be no better and may well be worse. This is so important a principle for him that he would have anyone who violates it punished by death and condemned to eternal infamy. 77 Thus it is that Spinoza, though he opposes monarchy because he believes that it is most likely to lead to tyranny, nonetheless also opposes abolishing monarchy when and where it already exists, 78 and repeatedly he cites Cromwell's Puritan Revo- lution as his case in point. 79 Leo Strauss correctly characte- rizes this attitude: "This is a sharpening of an unpolitical realism based on Spinoza's ultimate premises, an affirmation of the real out of non-political motives with later application to politics." 80 This ramification of the doctrine of natural law is not a peculiarity of Spinoza's; rather it inheres in the very nature of the doctrine. Even one of its ardent latter-day defenders must admit this. He points out that the theory as propounded by Hobbes, from whom Spinoza learned most of his political science, destroys the very possibility of distinguishing between good and bad government because whatever govern- ment is in power it has been brought about by the operation of nature and is, therefore, unobjectionable. It even destroys the theoretical possibility of resisting any sovereign decree whatsoever, regardless of its possible wickedness, because sovereignty is granted unlimited sway. 81 To give only one more example, also Hugo Grotius teaches such unrestricted acquiescence to established power on the basis of the natural law: "The law of nature further teaches that everyone must be content with what is his, not only because it is otherwise 7o7Op. cit., p. 244; Political Tractate, p. 356. 78 Theologico-Political Tractate, p. 242; Political Tractate, pp. 3I7 f . 79 e.g. Theologico-Political Tractate, p. 243. 80 Die Religio'nskritik Spi'nozas, Berlin 1930, p. 22I. 81 Strauss, Natural Right and History, op. cit., pp. I92 if.</page><page sequence="28">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 57 impossible to maintain friendship among men," 82 again an attitude which even by an admirer of Spinoza's is described as using "the ]aw of nature to provide Grotius with a basis for acquiescence to the social status quo." 83 The objections to the concept of natural law are not limited to moral and political ones, however. Also from the philoso- phical and epistemological perspective it has been shown to be untenable. For Kant this was an unjustifiable theory. It stipulated a number of things as given, as dogmatically and metaphysically irreducib]e, which could not defend themselves before the tribunal of human reason. As we have seen previously, natural law assumes the existence of man as an unchangeable reality, conscience as a divine and infallible faculty within man, and the moral law as an entity outside of and obj ectively confronting man. But the moral law, so Kant taught, is self-created and self-impcsed by man; it must be autonomous to be moral. Ethics are never given in any existing reality, be this now man or nature or revelation; they are ideals, "ought's," tasks to be achieved after they have been rationally defined. Man is not a noumenal reality whose permanent character may be assumed to have been formed from its very inception but in turn a perfectible being capable of change and improvement. A competent student of Kant then summarizes his position toward the concept of the natural law in these words: "We have reached the pinnacle of the system with respect to the metaphysical foundation of the philosophy of law. The concept of the natural law is replaced by the a priori, or rather by the reason which expands a priori into principles." 84 Thus, "however much the concepts of freedom and equality (as taught by Kant) seem to coincide with those of the natural 82 The Jurisprude'nce of Hollaznd, transl.

Freedom and equality are ideas which do not designate a "being" but an "ought," not a reality but a task of perfection which is to be attained gradually." 85 The position of Hermann Cohen with regard to the concept of natural law deserves to be stated fully, first]y because he is the outstanding representative of critical philosophy, second]y because it is not sufficiently known, thirdly because in the dispute between Maimonides and Spinoza with which we are concerned he is not only an interested and significant party but also tended, we may now say wrongly, to fear that in principle Spinoza, whom he opposed, might in this case have made a valid point against Maimonides as whose student he regarded himself. "The danger of scientific dogmatism resides in the philosophical, allegedly metaphysical prejudice that the foundation of morality is to be conceived as a natural law, as a law deposited in our bones. From this common starting-out point onward the paths and the directions diverge. Some say that we do everything out of compassion, others out of revenge. The so-called moral sense is blown in all directions. It is discerned in everything, and it is conceived of as being compulsory since it is revealed in all directions and interpretations. This is alleged to be the on]y basis for all human concepts and views of ethics, and this basis is found in human psychology, or rather, to be more exact, in physio- logy, for the senses have always been located within the small confines of these two disciplines ... When the moral law is conceived as a natural law, as is done by the naturalists of the senses, one is forced to revert to the psyche and to the metaphysics of rational psychology. The proper jurisdiction of ethics, which is derived from the ethos, is lost." 86 "Morality is not supposed to constitute a problem of its own but merely 5 ib., p. 287. 86 Ethik des Reinen Willens, Berlin I904, p. 94; cf. also p. 247.</page><page sequence="30">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 59 an exudation of nature,... but we know and understand that this view is a mediaeval error garbed in modern clothes." 87 Thus Cohen's first main objection to the doctrine of natural law is that it identifies ethics with physiology, the "ought" with "being;" it assumes that morality is something that exists rather than something that is to be achieved. A subsidiary weakness of the doctrine which results from this fundamental fault is that it leads to chaos, for all ethical programs have, as we had previously seen, invoked the warrant of nature for their particular theses. A last and even more crucial objection must be raised against the doctrine of the law of nature, Cohen continues. "Only this is here emphasized, that the ethical personality is not given and may not be pre-supposed with certain natural tendencies and conditions ... The ethical subject is not the spirit which so easily becomes a moral ghost. The ethical subj ect is not simply born and hereditarily determined; rather, however much birth and heredity may have to be taken into account, the person still always remains a new and peculiar problem which cannot be dissolved into its given factors and conditions. The method of purity liberates the concept of the ethical subject from prejudices... What meaning could ethics have if the ethical subject could be totally conceived as given, born, and raised in its environ- ment? Ethics would then dissolve in anthropology ... The method of purity, on the other hand, seeks to determine those conditions and concepts which-we may put it so- bring about the concept of the human being in accordance with the fundamental law of truth. Truth does not consider exclusively or even preferably a theoretical interest in the man of nature; it also demands the ethical interest in the man of culture and of universal history." 88 In other words, contrary to the necessary premise of all theories of natural law, man is not a given, permanent reality inaccessible to fundamental change.

Man is a being which, though shaped to somie extent by the con- ditions of his physical origin, can be and should be made in the image of the ethical imperatives which he rationally imposes upon himself. These imperatives are hypotheses in the Kantian sense, ideas produced not by experience but by the reason and thus "purely," though not idealistically in the sense that they either have no relationship to the basic principles of jurisprudence or that they cannot powerfully affect men's real lives. This, contrariwise then, is counsel of hope: man is capable of infinite self-perfection; let no man reject demands for reform on the ground that human nature is opposed to it. Subsidiary to this argument runs Cohen's final point, that natural law always defines man in terms of his most primitive and original estate; this is a scientific, cognitive, historical endeavor, not an ethical one. The truth of ethics is much more concerned not with what man is or was but with what he is and can become under the conditions of culture and history. Contemporary philosophers of law whose intellectual orien- tation was significantly influenced by the fundamental thoughts of Immanuel Kant, of Hermann Cohen and of his Marburg-school of critical philosophy have put their teachers' refutation of the doctrine of natural law into practice. Apply- ing it to the concrete reality of jurisprudence they have shown that the idea of natural law is both irrational and injurious and have replaced it with a more persuasive and constructive doctrine. Hans Kelsen is in some ways their most representa- tive spokesman. The law of nature, he declares, is the legal equivalent of the philosophical concept of the noumenon: it is supposed to "lie behind" the phenomenon of the actual, empirical law as its true, substantial, and permanent reality without in human experience ever being capable of being reached or even understood. But, like the idea of the nou- menon as such, this is an irrational idea, for, by definition, it cannot be grasped by human comprehension, and it cannot</page><page sequence="32">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 6i be made or shown to operate in the only universe which men inhabit, the universe of phenomena. 89 Furthermore, the philosophers of natural law, whenever they wish to bring their theory down into reality, necessarily and uselessly duplicate the principles of the law, for they must "positivize" the ideal law before it can become effective law. 90 If there were such a thing as a noumenal, "real," natural law it would be uncognizable anyway, and an uncognizable reality is, for human reality which is the only reality that can meaning- fully be considered in philosophic discourse, no reality at all. 91 Then again, as we have previously noted, whenever the natural law is brought down from its ethereal speculative heights into the arena of human experience, in other words when an attempt is made to spell out what it presumably commands, it turns out to impose on men precisely those obligations which the positive law, the law defined and enforced by existing human powers, commands anyway. Thus it justifies and perpetuates positive law and, far from having the revolutionary and rejuvenating effects which are sometimes ascribed to it, it is actually a profoundly con- servative force. 92 In this connection Kelsen alludes to Rousseau and claims that his social doctrine of man's nature was much less progressive than is generally believed. 93 In the context he cannot take the space to prove his point, but it is a point well worth understanding and affirming, it only because the historical connection between Rousseau and Spinoza has often been made. Whatever use the theoreticians of the French Revolution may have made of his writings, the fact remains that by the time Rousseau finishes defining "the 89 Die Philosophischen Grundlagen der Naturrechtslehre und des Rechtspositivismus, Berlin 1928, p. 62.

The individual may at most preserve his sense of freedom and righteousness in the privacy of his heart, but any and every public action, even in the sphere of religion, must be unquestioningly subordinated to the dictates of the state. At last Rousseau resorts to the specious freedom which, like Spinoza, defines liberty as resignation into necessity, identifies it with peace of mind, and best summarizes it in the words: "There is no more liberty on earth but in the heart of the righteous man," 94 and one commentator rightly describes this position, then, in this fashion: "The word libertas on the prison-gates (and we to day would add the inscription on the gate into the Dachau concentration camp) and on the chains of the galley slaves in Genoa seems to Rousseau symbolic of the real meaning of liberty in a civil state." 95 Non, Kelsen concludes, the law is human social self-creation according to reason. 96 Thus the concept of the natural law would seem to be disposed of once and for all. And yet, when all is said and done, there is one last consideration which prevents us from discarding it in toto. The philosophical arguments in its favor have not been found to be valid. But the necessities of social morality do impose an ultimate caution upon us. It is not unimportant, for example, that the idea of natural law first seems to have been formulated in the classical age of Greek philosophy as a protest against the positive law of the city with its superstitions and mythologies, its tyranny and unrighteousness. There is a law higher than that of the ruthless rulers, the philosophers declared, and to this law they appealed in the effort to liberate society. Since then it would almost always seem to have been in situations of social 94 Walter Eckstein, "Rousseau and Spinoza," Journal of the History of Ideas, V, 3, pp. 281 if. 95 ib., p. 288. 96 op. cit., p. 63.</page><page sequence="34">NOACHITES-SCHWARZSCHILD 63 stress that the law of nature was brought out again. Grotius expatiates upon it when the Netherlands are locked in combat with England over the freedom of the seas. Erich Cassirer studies it in a book published in Germany in I9I9 after the experience of the First World War. Leo Straus advocates its restoration after the experience of the lawlessness of Nazism and the Second World War. He makes no bones about it that it was this experience which frightened him into feeling the need for some reliable and permanent source of social morality. He refers specifically to Kelsen when he warns that the absence of a belief in natural law is an invita- tion to tyranny. 97 He persists in believing, or rather in hoping, that natural law is a revolutionary force, 98 for it is presumably something which even the dictator cannot set aside. With some justification he points out that, after all, also the historical school of jurisprudential thinking was meant to have a conservative impact on society since it was developed in the igth century largely as a reaction to and defense against the forces of the French Revolution which were, rightly or wrongly, associated with the idea of natural law. 99 That there remains a last necessity for the idea of natural law from this point of view even the neo-Kantians are pre- pared to grant to a certain extent. Hermann Cohen does not reject the idea completely but calls it "ambiguous,"-invalid and injurious for the reasons previously stated, but good in the sense that it expresses the impulse to rebellion against legal arbitrariness. 100 In his sense, however, the law of nature must be understood not as a law to be found in nature or even in human nature but rather as a law created by reason in accordance with, if you will, the nature of human ethics. Ernst Cassirer points out that in the thought of Kant and 97 Op. cit., p. 4. 98 ib., p. 93. 9 9 ib., pp. I2 . 100 op.

We ought to have it, and we ought not to have it at the same time. To proclaim it unambiguously, as Spinoza for example did, is to lead us into all sorts of philosophical and moral diffi- culties, and tc reject it completely leads us into grave dangers. This is precisely the point at which Maimonides' doctrine enters. He has been confronted with this kind of problem before: theology seems to require the belief in creation, and philosophy seems to refute it: in such a situation, he declares, the rational position to take is not to rely on the belief more than absolutely necessary,-if possible actually to do without it,-but then to try to make it as philosophically acceptable, even as likely as the reason is capable of doing. 103 And this is also the position he takes with regard to the problem of the law of nature: "The reason inclines toward it, and in Reve- lation it is confirmed;" 104 in other words, it is rationally likely and even necessary but also undemonstrable and dangerous. What in a modern Kantian like Cohen the self- legislating reason had to do to assure the benefits of natural 101 Rousseau, Kant, Goethe, Princeton 1945, p. 34: "Je cherche le droit et la raison et ne dispute pas des faits." 102 op. cit., p. 67; cf. also Schmitt, op.cit., pp. 103 f. 103 Cf.

This is by no means the same thing, nor is here the place to discuss the merits of the two positions and to weigh them against one another, but Maimonides' view may at least be said to have broken the stranglehold of a doctrine of natural law which regarded itself as being certain, immo- vable, and irresistible. His view proclaims that for effective law men need more than natural law, and this itself has proved itself to be an important philosophic achievement and a valuable contribution to the history of philosophic progress. In terms of his own philosophy Maimonides held the balance between the doctrine of natural law and the doctrine of positive (be this now divine or human) law, and this, it would seem, is also today as far as the human reason can go. 105 Centuries later Locke expressed the same belief: there is natural law, but it must be assured and affirmed by revelation, and to be able to do this revelation must be preceded by the knowledge of God. 106 And this is exactly what Maimonides said to the Noachite: the fulfillment of the moral law insures you of God's approval: the law of nature provides you with an inkling of the moral law, but by itself it is neither enough nor reliable; to know the moral law you also have to submit to Revelation, and you have to know God. To us he says: the law of nature must be preserved if only so that we will -not always be restricted to the fallibilities of the positive law, but this natural law cannot be relied on to reside in the nature -around man or in the nature within man; it must come from -a higher source. To Maimonides this source was, of course, divine revelation; to Cohen it was reason, or the nature which man will in the future make for himself. It is another question, perhaps the most important one, whether on this last score Maimonides or Cohen has more to teach us. 105 Compare Guide, II, 40: "Though the Torah is not natural, nonetheless it has a natural access." 106 Strauss, Natural Right and History, op. cit., pp. 203-205. 5</page></plain_text>
