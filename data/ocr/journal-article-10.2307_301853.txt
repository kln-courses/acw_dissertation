PREFACE (I) The present paper is a part of an historical work in which the present writer has been keenly interested for quite a long while. Trained in modern entomology, he wants to find out what his countrymen know about their insects. It is not easy to choose a proper title for different groups of insects. The findings presented here would not be of much interest to other entomologists except perhaps to certain special groups. But it seems to him that, for those who are interested in the history of science in China or in Chinese culture, it may serve some useful purpose. It is essentially a history of Chinese insects but, to study the Chinese people, this history of insects may be more helpful than a history of Chinese emperors. The term, " cicadas," is used here in a broad sense. It includes not only the true cicadas but also the plant lice, scale insects, (I) The cicada section is a part of the writer's doctorate thesis submitted to the Division of Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.</page><page sequence="3">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 277 leaf-hoppers, and some other homopterous insects. This grouping represents our modern conception of the relation of insects and should be understood as such only. The silver-fish forms a group by itself and is included here for the sake of convenience. The writer wants to take this chance to thank those who have shown keen interest in his work, particularly Dr. J. C. BEQUAERT for reading the manuscript, and Mr. T. Y. HSIAO for the proof-reading. He is also deeply obliged to his wife, Foo CHI- WEN, for her courageous sacrifice under the present Japanese invasion to let him pursue his scientific work. I. - CICADIDAE i. Since the publication of the Monograph of Oriental Cicadidae (I892) and especially during the last few years, a number of important papers have appeared on the Chinese Cicadidae. Thus we have the two papers by KATO (1930 and I934) and the three catalogues by CHEN (1932), SCHMIDT (1932), and Wu (I935), respectively. But they are all more or less of a taxonomical nature. Excepting MYERS' Insect Singers (I929) where Chinese references were assiduously collected by the author, no one seems to care what the Chinese have written on these insects. 2. The cicadas as a group, on account of their natural endowment, are among the most popular insects everywhere. They may be known under different names during different periods in history or in different parts of the world. But they are catholic. They will sing any time, any place, and for any people. To them there is no East, no West, no past, and no present. It is perhaps because of this catholicism that they have given rise to so many customs common among different peoples of the globe. 3. In China, as in Europe, they are among those insects known from the earliest records, such as the Shih Ching, the Erh Yak, the Li Chi, and the Chou Li. But these classical references, quantitatively speaking, are really trivial when compared with what has been written during the later periods. For instance, as early as the i8th century, the Tu Su Chi Chen (1725) had to allow sixty full pages to the collection of extracts of literature on these insects.</page><page sequence="4">278 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 4. With our modern standards, of course, not all thesereferences can be considered as of equal value; some are good and some bad. Nevertheless, the present writer will not exercise any discrimination and whatever is known to him will be presented to the reader for him to judge. This attitude is adopted for the simple reason that, historically speaking, the bad ones are just as instructive as the good ones. At least, their authors were just as honest in what they wrote as we are today, and hence the bad ones will tend to show that even so-called scientific truth is not necessarily final. For the sake of convenience, the presentation wil be divided into three main headings, namely; biological, economic, and aesthetic. Readers are requested to notice particu- larly those points which the Chinese share with other peoples of the world. A. - BIOLOGICAL TETTIGOLOGY IN CHINA 5. As the title indicates, this section will include only those materials which are related to the morphology, classification, life history, ecology, and various other biological phases of the cicadas. The main idea is to find out what the ancient Chinese knew or thought they knew about the insects themselves. In this connection it may be pointed out that the progress in China, as shown in the following pages, is somewhat similar to that in the West; namely, there was a long period of intellectual somnolence, which extended from a few centuries after Christ to as late as the i8th century. I- Morphology 6. Morphologically speaking, the cicadas were well understood by the ancient Chinese. The insect itself has been figured in many books, such as the Cheng Lei Pentsao (iio8), the Pentsao Kang Mu (0578), the San Tsai Tu Hui (i609), and the Tu Su Chi Chen. In Cheng Lei Pentsaoo, besides the adult insect itself, both the exuvia and the infected nymph are also included. 7. Before the i6th century no structural characters were mentioned except the wei in the Record of Rites, the strings in</page><page sequence="5">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 279 Fu SHIEN'SfU, the head in the Book of Odes, and the wings in TUAN CHEN-SHIH'S notes. The strings are interpreted as the antennae. But the wei has been variously interpreted. While some regard it as the rostrum, others think of it as referring to the antennae. It was Li SHIH-CHEN, the author of the famous Pentsao Kang Mu, who first defined the family as insects with head truncated in front, vertex broad, two (?) wings, six legs, and with the sound produced from the flanks. The number of the wings must be a mistake; for with insects so large as the cicadas there should be no chance for miscounting. Otherwise the definition is a good one. Li SHIH-CHEN also makes some remarks about the habits and the life history of these insects, which will be brought up later. 8. It is, however, from a study of the Chinese character for the insect itself that one sees the morphology at its best. It tends to show that the ancient Chinese were very ingenious in achieving the highest economy in their philology, simple and systematic in their nomenclature, and even made morphology a part of the daily life of the common people. 9. In the Chinese language, the cicada is known as " tchen." This term is evidently a later supersession. Except one case in Li Chi, diau, not tchen, is the name commonly used in all the Classics. According to YANG SHIUNG (53 B.C.-i8 A.D.), " tchen " is a local name used in Shansi and Shensi. But after the beginning of the Christian era, it gradually became nationwide. io. This change was probably brought about by the political and military achievements of the Ch'in dynasty (225-2o6 B.C.) which began in Shansi and Shensi. i i. According to general interpretation, " tchen " is connected with the term " san," which is colored more or less with Buddhism. Thus Lu DIEN writes in his Pai Yah that " tchen " means transformation, referring to the habit of these insects in emerging from a dark and subterranean life to that of a pure and celestial one. The same idea was also ascribed to the amulets used during the Shang dynasty (1766-iI22 B.C.). To a certain extent, this interpretation may be correct. But the Buddhist conception evidently is imposed on the idea of " tchen," because " tchen was long in use before this religion came to China. I2. It appears that an etymological explanation of this term would be more logical and reasonable. The character " tchen "</page><page sequence="6">280 G. KAN-CHIH LIU is made up of two parts, the " tchang " and the " dan." The former is a symbol commonly used to denote the class to which the animal belongs and its function in the Chinese language corresponds exactly to the -idae or other endings as employed today in taxonomy. The symbol is found practically in all the names the Chinese have for insects, worms, snakes, and other animals of the -same standing. The " dan " here is the cicada itself and, as it stands, should not fail to impress the reader with the likeness of this character to the insect which it represents. In this character, the prominent eyes and the massive thorax of the cicada are all vividly depicted. In short, the Chinese character is a true pictograph. For further comparison, the reader is -referred to Figure 4. As to the pronunciation, " tchen " is probably a philological variation of the character " tan," which means vibration and refers probably to the vibration of the sound produced by the insect in singing. I 3. This etymological interpretation is in strict accord with two of the six basic principles employed by the Chinese for the coinage of their words, namely the shiang-shing or hieroglyphism, and the hui-sun or description of sound. Thus interpreted, it shows that the ancient Chinese were really ingenious in achieving economy in their language. In addition to a picture of the insect itself, its classification and one of its main characters were simul- taneously indicated in the same place. A " tchen," therefore, to a Chinese means much more than a cicada to an Englishman. 2. - The sound-producing organ I4. The sound-producing organ was also well understood by the earlier Chinese but, just as in Europe, it was not definitely located until a much later period. It is true that the way in which the sound of a cicada differs from that of other insects was recognized before the Christian era and that the female cannot sing was noticed by TAO HUNG-CHING during the sixth century. But where the sound of the male is produced was not explicitly stated until the Ming dynasty (I368-i644). I 5. In Europe, it may be recalled, the first record for the sound of cicada came from the work of HESIOD who thought</page><page sequence="7">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 28i that the sound was produced from under the wings. In China the earliest record was included in the Chou Li where the cicadas were classified as insects which produce their sound from the flanks or armpits. Both statements probably mean the same thing with the Chinese expression a little more definite. i6. But since the beginning of the Christian era, the opinion gradually gained in China that the sound was produced from the wings. This was not so bad as the Egyptian theory that the sound was produced by rubbing the rostrum against the under surface of the thorax, but was certainly no better than the European explanation that cicadas could not sing unless their membranes were dry, an explanation which, according to MYERS, was repeated by CARUS as late as i829. It must have appeared quite strange to LIu AN (died I22 B.C.) when he made the remark that cicadas could sing even without a mouth. I7. This wing theory was allowed to persist until the early part of the i 6th century when it was first denounced by Hu SHIH, the author of Tseng Chu Chuan (The Boat of Pearls). Hu SHIH lived during the reign of Emperor TSIH CHUNG of the Ming dynasty. In the book just mentioned, he writes, " I saw two holes in the armpits and the sound is produced by vibration. It is wrong to say that the sound is produced by the wings." i8. Hu SHIH, however, was not the only one to make this discovery. The same fact was also discovered by WANG KWEI. In his Lai Hai Lu (To Measure the Sea with an Oyster-shell), he writes: Cicadas love sunshine. They live among trees but, unlike the crickets, sing from the underside of the body. Their sound is produced from the fupan (abdominal plates). The crickets love shade. They live on the ground but sing from the upperside of their body. Their sound is produced from the wings. The cicadas are of a sunny nature and so they sing in chorus and like to relay their sound from one to another. The crickets are of a shady nature and jealous and so they fight whenever they encounter one another. i9. It is not certain when this author lived. While one source places him in the Sung dynasty (960-II27), another says that he lived during the Ming. His comparison is very interesting because it shows how anthropomorphism was introduced by the ancient Chinese into the psychic world of the insects. The Chinese apparently made no attempt to explain the mechanism of the</page><page sequence="8">282 G. KAN-CHIH LIU sound-production. In Europe, it may be recalled, the sound mechanism of the cicadas was thought by ARISTOTLE to lie in the agitation of air inside the body of the insects. 3. - Classification 20. In classification the ancient Chinese seemed to have done fairly well, too. True, the work was more or less limited to terminological definitions and little had been done towards a working hypothesis or a general system. But this is not surprising. Either the growth of their mind had not reached such a stage or- the number of insects they knew was so small that they had no need for such a hypothesis or system. What is surprising is that taxonomical interest should appear to be well maintained throughout the whole history. 21. There were a few important attempts at classification. The first and perhaps also the earliest one was what one may call the catalogue of cicadas in the Erh Yah. This book is one of the thirteen Classics and, so far as entomology is concerned, is remarkable in many respects. It contains a chapter on insects, where the author showed that his conception of this class was more or less in agreement with ours. But who the author was and when the book was published have been topics of long controversy. Some modern scholars, both Chinese and Europeans, are inclined to consider it as a work of Pu SHIANG (born 507 B.C.) who was a disciple of CONFUCIus. But it seems to be much better to admit that we do not know. 22. The list of cicadas in this book is made up of fifteen epithets without any description. This method is very unsatis- factory. It is possible that with the exception of the first one each of these epithets may stand for a distinct species. But the lack of description leaves the whole field free for individual speculation and today one can hardly find two persons who would agree on the interpretation. The number of species of this classical catalogue has been variously determined from five to eight. 23. After Erh Yah the next important step in classification was the principle proposed in the Chou Li. This book is also a Classic and its origin is also debatable. The principle it advances</page><page sequence="9">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 283 is the way the sound is produced by insects. On this principle the insects are divided into six groups and the cidadas, as mentioned before, are classified with those which produce their sound from the flanks. In the original text, no example is given; the author simply gives a list of the ways by which the sound of insects may be produced and proposes that this difference be employed as one of the criteria for classification. The different insects, including the cicadas, are first introduced by TSENG SHUAN in his Exegesis. There is no question that the specificity of the sound of insects has been recognized and employed by the Chinese as one of the chief means to separate these creatures. This is shown by the fact that most of the names the Chinese have for cicadas are nothing but description of the sound these insects produce. 24. During the first century another important attempt was made by YANG SHIUNG in his Fang Yen (Local Dialect). Here, besides pointing out how some of the common species are called by different names in different localities, the author for the first time introduces a brief description for some of the insects he lists. Besides two female forms, his knowledge of the cicada fauna consists of seven species; one of which is described for the first time. His type of work was continued by CHANG YI, the author of Poh Yah, who lived during the latter part of the fifth century. 25. The work of Li SHIH-CHEN, who was the author of the famous Pentsao Kang Mu, marks another epoch. As mentioned before, Li SHIH-CHEN was the first one to give a definition for the Cicadidae. True, his knowledge of these insects was limited to what had been known before his time. No new species could be credited to him. True also that his type of work was preceded by TAO HUNG-CHING (452-536). But Li SHIH-CHEN was the first one to advocate the necessity of clear definition. He deplored the confusion existing in literature about these insects and he defined, either on the basis of his own observation or descriptions from other sources, each of the eight species he recognized. In short, he was essentially a revisionist and revision was badly needed by his time. 26. When one comes to the Erh Yah Yen Yi, or the Exegesis of Erh Yah, one finds oneself faced with an author who, while</page><page sequence="10">284 G. KAN-CHIH LIU still displaying a strong color of scholasticism, was nevertheless modern in his treatment of biological problems. The author was Ho YI-SHING (1757-i825) who was born in Chishia, Shantung, and was known more as scholar than a high government official. As the title of his book indicates, his activity was confined to the explanation of the contents of the Erh Yah and consequently he had no new species to introduce. In other words, he was still a slave to the scholastic doctrine. On the other hand, he was scientific in many ways. For each of the cicadas in the Erh Yah, not only did he give all references known to him, but he would also sum up, as a rule, his annotations with a detailed description, mostly based upon his own observation, of the insect in point. In many cases, sounds, habits, and habitats were also included. In short, he did in the Erh Yah more or less what would be expected of a good systematist in our time. 27. Besides these five important works on classification, there are many fragmentary statements on the same topic, especially in medical writings. But their importance on the whole is over- shadowed by the five works just mentioned. In this connection, it may be pointed out that it is unfair to make any comparison between the East and the West. True, according to MYERS, in Europe only three cicadas were known to RE1AUMUR (i683-1757) as late as the i8th century. But this disparity is due obviously to the intrinsic disparity of the fauna of these two regions. In other words, the cicada fauna in Europe is not so rich as it is in China. 4. - Cicadas in Chinese literature 28. This section is a purely systematic discussion. It is included here because it is deemed more advisable to try to determine as much as we can the kinds of cicadas mentioned in Chinese literature so that we may have some idea what they are when they are met in the following discussions. The task is not an easy one and what is identified here may have to be revised with the increase of our knowledge. 29. There are thirty-three names given for cicadas in the Chinese Encyclopedia. Most of them were supposed to be synonyms. But it is more likely that they represent more than</page><page sequence="11">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 285 the number of species listed below. The following identification is done in general by checking the Chinese description against the specimens the writer has on hand. In some cases the deter- mination seems to be fairly certain. However, when the descrip- tion is too short, it should not be taken for more than guesswork. a) TSAR-TCHEN-Cryptotympanus pustulatus FAB. 30. The tsar-tchen is the name generally used by the physicians. In classical literature it is known as mien, madiau, or simply tchen. It is the cicada menitoned as food in the Li Chi, the diau of the Book of Odes, the fourth species recognized by Ho YI-SHING in the Erh Yah, and the medicinal cicada of the Chinese physicians. It was first described by TAO HUNG-CHING as " black and the largest of its kind." It appears to be fairly certain that this is the C. pustulatus of FABRICIUS. The color, size, and the distribution of this species as we know it today would fit in with the description and records in Chinese literature. It should be understood, however, that the term, " largest," can only be applied to the case of TAO HUNG-CHING who was a native of Nan- king. It may be mentioned that the Japanese also identify this species with tsar-tchen. b) TANG-DIAU-Oncotympana maculaticollis MOTSCHULSKY 31. The tang-diau has undergone many changes. In the Book of Odes, the tang appears to refer to a species which is different from the diau. It was in the Local Dialect where the author stated that tang-diau was a local name used in Sungwei (Honan) for the cicada. In this case it appears to be a common term. But since Kou Pu (276-324) first defined it as " smaller than the tchen and with a clear sound," its application has been gradually restricted to a particular species. Kou Pu also made the remark that it is the tang-yi of the Kiangnan. During the i6th century its hua-kuan (flower cap) was first pointed out and employed by LI SHIH-CHEN as the main character to separate it from the tchen. Ho YI-SHING also had something to add. He described it as " smaller than ma-diau with its back greenish-yellow and with a flower cap on its head." It may be recalled that both tchen and ma-diau are synonyms of tsar-tchen.</page><page sequence="12">286 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 32. It appears that this tang-diau might be what we know in science as 0. maculaticollis. In form, size, and distribution, this insect is somewhat similar to C. pustulatus. The " flower cap " might refer to the yellow band across the vertex between the eyes, a character which is absent in pustulatus. The " back " evidently refers to the thorax and the " greenish-yellow" would also fit in with the " back " of maculaticollis. This description, however, can only be applied to the typical form. In some of the varieties of this species, the back may be entirely black. According to Ho YI-SHING the insect loves to sing and the sound is somewhat like " wuyu... wuyu... wuyu." 33. This is also a medicinal cicada but was not mentioned until the i6th century when it first appeared in the Pentsao Kang Mu. However, it is quite possible that, on account of its close resemblance to pustulatus, it might have been confused and used accordingly before the difference was first recognized by Li SHIH-CHEN. In the latter case, it might have been also used as food. c) LIANG-DIAU- ?Graptopsaltria tienta KARSCH 34. The determination of this species is quite doubtful. It is the second name in the Erh Yah and, according to the Local Dialect, a common name for cicadas in the Chentseng region (Honan). The difficulty lies in the fact that, while Ho YI-SHING refused to recognize it as a distinct species, it was admitted by Li SHIH-CHEN as one of the three cicadas used as drugs in his time. Furthermore, the only positive character given is the "five-colored" which, unfortunately, is a common term with a wide range of application. It appears that Li SHIH-CHEN had not seen the insect himself because his description was borrowed from others. 35. According to our present knowledge, Lyristes sinensis, G. tienta, and the various species of Platypleura can all be described as " five-colored." Among the species of Platypleura, kaempferi is quite common in China and may be taken for this liang-diau. But the fact that it had not been seen by Li SHIH-CHEN, a native of Hupeh, makes this suggestion doubtful. Furthermore the size of all the species of Platypleura is also not in its favor. 36. The distribution of the other two, G. tienta and L. sinensis,</page><page sequence="13">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 287 so far as we know today, is very much localized; the former has not been known outside Mt. Omei and the latter only from Szechuan. Szechuan is a big place. Where DISTANT found his sinensis is not known. But the specimen the writer has came from Ta-tsien-lu. Both Mt. Omei and Ta-tsien-lu are famed in China for the drugs they produce. Mt. Omei is much better known because it is one of the four Sacred Mountains in China and is visited during summer by thousands of pilgrims from near and far. G. tienta is a large and attractive cicada which is very abundant in Mt. Omei. It is with these considerations that the present writer is inclined to think that LI SHIH-CHEN'S liang-diau might be KARSCH'S species. 37. In Japan liang-diau is used for Melampsalta radiator UHLER. Hitherto this insect has not been reported from China although the writer has a specimen from Manchuria. But if the Japanese uses liang-diau in the original Chinese sense, this identification does not seem to be justified because UHLER'S species can hardly be described as " five-colored." d) TsING-TsING-Lyristes sinensis DISTANT 38. Tsing-tsing is used here in YANG SHIUNG'S sense. In the Erh Yah, it appears as the fifth species and is regarded by Ho YI-SHING as a synonym for the fourth one, tsar. But Ho YI-SHING's species appears to be a different one. 39. YANG SHIUNG regards tsing-tsing and meh-tsar as two separate species and describes the former as variegated and the latter as much smaller than the tchen. As just mentioned, L. sinensis was described by DISTANT from Szechuan which is the native province of YANG SHIUNG. It appears to the writer that tsing-tsing might be L. sinensis and meh-tsar, Meimuna operlifera. The latter has not been reported from Szechuan but is already known to occur from Peiping, Chekiang, Canton, and Japan. This wide distribution indicates that it might be found in Szechuan. e) SHIANG-CHO-LIAO-Platypleura kaempferi FAB. 40. Shiang-cho-liao is used in Ho YI-SHING'S sense, who considers it as a synonym for the tsing-tsing and the tsar in the</page><page sequence="14">288 G. KAN-CHIH LIU Erh Yah. In his Exegesis he writes, " These insects are called shiang-cho-liao in Chishia and tse-tse in Fengtien. They are stout with the vertex broad and the head truncated. The body is variegated and the sound is clear and soft as when we say ' tse... tse... tse '" The wide distribution, the stout form, and the variegated coloration suggest that this shiang-cho-liao might be the P. kaempferi. Ho YI-SHING even considers the tsing-tsing of Erh Yah as the tseng of the Book of Odes. But the tseng, as it is figured in the Chinese Encyclopedia, looks like an Aphrophora, not like a cicada. The tseng is shown in Figure 7. f) MAO-DIAU-Mogannia hebes WALKER 4I. The mao-diau appears in the Erh Yah as the seventh cicada and is regarded by all writers as a synonym for the sixth one, tcho. It is described as a small green cicada which begins to sing in the fifth month and lives among grasses. It might be some of the Cicadatra which are usually small and live among grasses. But the color and the wide distribution suggest that it might be M. hebes which has a wide distribution from Canton to Manchuria. The one described by TSENG CHIAO (I I04-I i62) as reddish is perhaps a color variation. Among specimens the writer has from Peibay, Szechuan, some are definitely reddish. g) ER-Huechys sanguinea DEGEER 42. Er appears in the Erh Yah as the tenth cicada and is considered by a number of writers as a synonym for the eleventh one, han-diau. But han-diau, as shown in the next paragraph, appears to be a different species which is somewhat superficially related to the er. Er is used here in YANG SHIUNG'S sense, who describes it in his Local Dialect as black and red. The combination of these two colors suggests that it might be the famous medicinal cicada, H. sanguinea. Its complication with the Fulgorid, Lycorma delicatula in the Pentsao, as appeared in European literature, will be discussed elsewhere. h) HAN-CHIANG-Scieroptera splendidula FAB. 43. Han-chiang is first introduced by Kou Pu and is generally considered by most writers as the han-diau of the Erh Yah and</page><page sequence="15">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 289 the han-tchen of the Book of Odes. Both Kou Pu and LI SHIH- CHEN describe it as greenish-red but Ho YI-SHING states that it is greenish-yellow. The latter also makes the remark that it is the chu-liang of the common people and that the sound it produces is somewhat " yuyi... yuyi... yuyi." It appears to the present writer that the han-chiang of Kou Pu might be S. splendidula and Ho YI-SHING'S chu-liang might be simply a variety. In Japan, han-chiang is taken as Meimuna operlifera. But the Chinese description, as given by different writers, does not seem to agree with this species. i) HuI-Ku-Mogannia cyanea WALKER. 44. The hui-ku has a long list of synonyms and is generally considered as the ting-shiu or shilu of the Erh Yah. Hui-ku, however, is the one best known in literature and, according to the Local Dialect, a local name used in Hunan and Hupeh. It was first described by TAO HUNG-CHING as purplish-blue and begins to sing in the fourth and the fifth month. Further details were given by Ho YI-SHING who wrote: " The deh-lao begins to sing in the seventh month by calling its own name. It is a small and slender cicada with a bluish-green color and is known as fu-de-fu-liang in Fengtien." The discrepancy about the time of appearance is due perhaps to the fact that TAO HUNG-CHING was a native of Nanking while Ho YI-SHING was born in Shantung. The color and the size suggest that this hui-ku might be what we know in science as M. cyanea. In Japan, hui-ku is identified with P. kaempferi, a species which can hardly be said to agree with the Chinese description. j) TSAN-Gaeana sp. 45. This insect made its first appearance with H. sanguinea and M. operlifera in the Local Dialect and was described by YANG SHIUNG as large and black. Ho YI-SHING considered it as the pi-diau or wang-fu of the Erh Yah. The fact that it was compared with sanguinea and operlifera suggests that this large black cicada might refer to some species of the genus Gaeana. 46. According to Wu's catalogue, several species of this genus are known to occur in China. No records have been reported '9</page><page sequence="16">290 G. KAN-CHIH LIU from Szechuan. Specimens the writer has all came from Kwangsi while those in the Harvard collection bear no definite locality. The genus is essentially Oriental and, Szechuan being definitely Oriental in its zoological affinity, may extend its range to this region. k) LING-MENG 47. This insect was first mentioned by TAO HUNG-CHING who made the remark that it is smaller than the han-chiang and begins to sing in the second month. At present it is difficult to ascertain its systematic position. In Japan ling-meng is identifiedas Terpnosia pryeri DISTANT. But hitherto this species has not been reporten from China. 1) TSING-FU. 48. This is the Chinese money-cicada. It was first introduced into medicine by CHEN CHANG-CHI and figured by Li SHIH-CHEN in his Pentsao Kang Mu. But it is very difficult to formulate any idea what species it is. Its social implication will be discussed later. 5. - The life history of cicadas 49. Concerning the life history of cicadas, we have a large amount of literature, both good and bad. On the one hand, we find it recognized very early that the different species of cicadas have different periods of emergence. For instance, in the Li Chi the tchen was taken as herald of midsummer and the han-tchen of late autumn. The reader should notice that this Classic did not put emphasis on any particular date of appearance. 50. Furthermore the life history of this family in general appears to be also more or less understood as early as the first century after Christ. WANG TSUNG (born 27 A.D.), the author of Lun Heng (Criticism), in his Essay on Death, writes, " Before transformation, the cicadas are fuyu (nymphs) but after trans- formation they give up the form of fuyu and take up the form of the adult." Again on Formlessness, " Chitsao (grubs) change to fuyu and fuyu change to tchen (adult). But the adult with</page><page sequence="17">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 291 its two ( ?) wings does not look like the grub." Still in another place he makes the remark that the imago emerges from a slit on the back of the nymph. All these references from one person, scattered as they are, when put together, indicate that the life history of cicadas was more or less understood. It is really more than one can expect that the difference of the nymphal stages of these insects should be recognized and distinguished in such early times. 5P. But there is cause for even greater surprise, namely the detailed description of the ecdysis of these insects made before the tenth century. There are two such papers from the Tang dynasty. Both were presented in the form of fu, a form of Chinese poems generally used for descriptive purposes. It is difficult to reproduce the text in the original style but, judging from our present knowledge on this process, both papers appear to be fairly faithful records of close observation. The following piece is the earlier one. 52. There may be many kinds of transformation but that of the cicadas is always the same. These insects will always give up their useless armor and leave it kneeling on the branch in order to save the body that can produce sound, and fly away to a safe place to sing all day. 53. When they live underground in the garden, no one knows where they are. When the first sign of a hole appears where it was never suspected before, it is a sign that they are coming out for transformation. They crawl stealthily towards a secluded bush, moving as if they had a great weight on their minds. All the time they appear to be very anxious to climb up something as soon as they can. However, when they do find some object, they ascend cautiously as if they were afraid of falling. 54. They know their time to appear and their time to disappear. What they want to avoid are the chilly autumn and the torrid summer. When the right moment arrives, as they suspend themselves on the tree, there is nothing to do under the hazy moon except waiting for the body to separate. After feeling around for a firm grasp, they begin to twist, to shrink, and to try to get the body out. Gradually the armor gives way and soon there appears a different thing. 55. This fu was the work of Tso LAO. The later one by Li YUAN is essentially the same except that this author explicitly stated that the process starts from the back. It is possible that these two scholars happened to make their observations on the same species. Li YUAN was evidently a keen observer because some of his poems on other insects contains also much scientific truth. Both Li YUAN and Tso LAO lived during the Tang dynasty</page><page sequence="18">292 G. KAN-CHIH LIU (607-9i8) but this fact is all we know about their life. These two papers are found in the Chinese Encyclopedia. 56. The species on which Ko TSUNG-PI made his observations appears to be C. pustulatus. Ko TSUNG-PI was a physician who wrote in his Pentsao Yen Yi: " The sound of the tsar-tchen is monotonous. The insects generally emerge from underground in the evening, climb up to a high place, burst on the back, and come out from the armor. The reason why emergence always occurs before sunrise appears to be due to the fact that, besides being afraid of human disturbances, the heat of the sun may desiccate the armor and, as a consequence, the insect may not be able to extract itself. When winter comes, the insects generally drop to the ground." 57. Ko TSUNG-PI was one of those few scholars who seldom allowed fancy to enter their observation. The remark he made on the life history of this cicada is more or less accurate. Occasionally, however, he made some mistake in accepting popular beliefs without sufficient scrutiny. For instance, concerning the cicada, he made the remark that the size and the sound of the adult insects increase as the time goes on. This statement, of course, is wrong. 58. The remark made by Li Su on the life history of M. cyanea may be also regarded as good. Li Su wrote in his Chien Wu (See Things), which is dated I582, "After the ninth month the weather is too cold for further transformation. The insect makes an earthen ball and passes the winter underground. When spring comes, it emerges as an adult. This is the hui-ku. It lives until summer and then dies. In the northwest where the winter is too severe, it cannot live." 59. Li Su was one of the best entomologists China has ever produced. Upon the basis of his own observation, he denounced the theory of spontaneous generation for a number of insects. But with the cicada his statement appears to be confusing. After reading one gets the impression that he had all the cicadas mixed up and considered them all as one species. We shall have occasion to mention his work again. 6o. There are some other good papers to be mentioned later. From these references, it appears that the main facts of the life history of cicadas were more or less well understood by the</page><page sequence="19">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 293 ancient Chinese. It is with this knowledge that we are surprised to find that side by side with these factual records, there should be so many speculations evidently received with equal en- couragement. The " queen theory " is extremely interesting. It deals with the origin of the cicada and is more or less analogous to the one in Europe. It was supposed to be advanced by TUNG TSUNG-SHU (I34 B.C.-87 A.D.) as an explanation for the " chinue " which is a local name for cicada in Shantung. In responding to a question asked by LIu HUN why cicadas were called " chinue," TUNG TSUNG-SHU said: 6i. In ancient time the queen of the Kingdom of Ch'i had a serious mis- understanding with the king. Finally she died from grief. But after her death she changed into a cicada, climbed up a tree in the courtyard, and complained to the king of the wrong he had done her. The king repented deeply and it was for this reason that the cicadas were called " chinue," or the girl of Ch'i. 62. It may be mentioned that " chinue " means the girl of Ch'i. This story is found in the Ku Ching Chu (Notes on Things Past and Present) which is the work of TS'UI PAO who lived during the fourth century. It was denounced by LI SHIH-CHEN who, basing his argument upon a verse in the Book of Odes, suggested that cicadas were called " chinue " because the face of these insects had been compared by a poet with the face of a beautiful princess of the Kingdom of Ch'i. So far as the Chinese story is concerned, this historical explanation seems to be quite logical. But certainly it cannot be applied to the Muse story of PLATO and the lady story of the Romagna Toscana in Italy; stories very similar to the Chinese one. It is possible that TS'uI PAO just recorded one of the popular stories of his time but cloaked it under the authority of a great scholar. It is interesting to notice that the Chinese, just as the Europeans, should consider the singing of these insects also as a form of complaints (vide MYERS' Insect Singers, p. i6). 63. Another story, appearing about the same time, attributed the origin of the cicadas to two aquatic plants. This theory was put forward by Kou HUNG, a mystic naturalist of the fourth century, who asserted that there were two kinds of cicadas: the natural one and the one transformed from the stems of shing (Limnanthemun) and the roots of chin (Panicum?). This theory, however, was not very well known.</page><page sequence="20">294 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 64. During the Tang dynasty, through a number of curious coincidences, another theory was destined to hold sway for a long time to come. This was the belief that the cicada larva came from the dung-beetle. This idea was first recorded in the U Yang Tsa Chou by TUAN CHEN-SHIH and was further elaborated by Su KOoN, Li SHIH-CHEN, and a host of others to mean that the larva of the former came from the dung balls made by the beetle. 65. This fallacy, in confining itself to the nymphal stage, is still more or less excusable because both in form and in habit, as we know, the nymphal stages of these two insects do show some close resemblance to each other. But the fallacy did not stop here. It went further to assume that the adult cicada was transmuted from the beetle. 66. This belief seemed to have become very strong during the sixteenth century, and it must have caused considerable perplexity to Li Su when he tried to reconcile this cicada-beetle relation with his knowledge on the life history of other insects in general. Li Su, as pointed out before, had condemned a number of fallacies on the spontaneous generation of insects. This transmutation must have appeared to him to be inconsistent. But it must be understood that he lived at the zenith of the scholastic period and furthermore the fact that this cicada-beetle relation was mentioned by WANG TSUNG and TUAN CHEN-SHIH must also have had its influence on his opinion. It may be mentioned that the works of these two men are admired even today for their originality. So Li Su tried to explain, away this strange relation by assuming a transitional stage between the Scarabaeidae and the Cicadidae through a beetle and a cicada which show more resemblance to each other. In other words, according to his idea, the transmutation from the beetle to the cicada was accomplished by having the sacred beetle (Catharsius molossus L.) first changed into tsar-tchen (C. pustulatus) and from the tsar-tchen later changed into other cicadas. 67. As mentioned before, this fallacy was the result of a number of curious coincidences. But perhaps it would not have arisen were it not for the fact that the Chinese term for the white- grub, or chitsao, had undergone definitely but unconsciously a gradual change in its application. About the beginning of the</page><page sequence="21">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 295 Christian era, it was apparently used for the earlier stages of the cicada or for both the Cicadidae and the Scarabaeidae. Even as late as the Tang dynasty, one finds that CHEN CHANG-CHI still employed it for the larva of cicada; but later it appeared to have been gradually restricted to that of the beetle alone. This change and the superficial resemblance of the nymphal stages of these two insects were perhaps responsible for this theory. 68. TUAN CHEN-SHIH was responsible for the spread of another fallacy, namely the rotten-wood theory. Unfortunately here we have another coincidence as shown in the following account: 69. WE FAN lived in Duchue. He had a degree from the government, namely shiu-tsai. One day in winter, while digging some firewood, he was surprised to find some fuyu clinging to the rotten portion of the roots. On learning from the villager that the cicadas were transmuted from rotten wood, he was tempted to see for himself. He picked one up and opened it. He found that the inside of the nymph was still full of rotten wood. 70. Judging from his work as a whole, TUAN CHEN-SHIH was a man who enjoyed seeing things for himself. Observations made by himself were always vividly and accurately described and many of them could be easily checked today, if one would like to take the trouble. But he seemed to be ready to accept whatever he heard and his reports on such hearsays, as a rule, were of a fantastic nature. In this case of cicada, it is really unfortunate because here the truth is turned to support a falsehood. 7I. But these are not all. During the latter part of the sixteenth century another fallacy made its appearance. The following account is what one finds in the Liu Tsing Yi Chi (Diary From Tsing) of TIEN YI-HENG: People are used to think that the han-tchen, as mentioned in the essay of Tsou YAO, is a tse-liao. This assumption, however, is a mistake. The han-tchen is a small green cicada which sings intermittently with a gee... gee... gee sound. In most cases, these insects are transformed from the aquatic black-shelled worms which are commonly called shio-pechung (naiad) and come from the eggs of the dragonfly. The dragonfly lays its eggs on aquatic plants by dipping its tails into water. The eggs are devoured by a fish, called tsingshio, develop in the latter's stomach, later eat their way out, and look like cicadas but smaller. After moulting they become real cicadas. 72. Obviously here we have a mass of entirely unrelated facts woven naively into a simple story. Part of the statements would</page><page sequence="22">296 G. KAN-CHIH LIU apply very well to the life history of the dragonfly. But how the cicada and the dragonfly should have ever become involved is something beyond one's understanding. It is perhaps another case of philological derivations. In Chinese the dragonfly is known as tsing-ting and, as shown before, tsing-tsing is the name of a cicada. This accidental connection might have become the basis for this theory. Or it might have originited from Kou HUNG'S theory of aquatic plants. 73. All these fallacies were allowed to persist until the early part of the nineteenth century when Ho YI-SHING first sounded the death knell. Under the section on cicadas in his Exegesis. this scholar writes: The statement that cicadas were transmuted from rotten wood or dung-beetle and the statement made by WANG TSUNG that cicadas came from chitsao are all erroneous. According to my own observation, the female cicada cannot sing. They lay the eggs which after hatching migrate underground and later change into cicadas. 74. The criticism made by Ho YI-SHING on the chitsao of WANG TSUNG seems to be unfair. So far as one can see today, WANG TSUNG did not imply that his chitsao is the grub of the beetle. All he did was to show that there is some difference between the earlier and the later stage of the nymph of cicada. He should not be held responsible if posterity elects to use chitsao for the grub of the beetle alone. As pointed out before, WANG TSUNG was the first one to point out that the ecdysis of these insects starts on the back. One has good reason to believe that his statement was based upon his own observation and that, when he made his statement, he had no beetle in mind. 75. If the origin of cicadas found all kinds of connections with various objects, both animate and inanimate, the time of their emergence, a simple and normal phenomenon in nature, was even carried to the sphere of national affairs. As mentioned before, cicadas were employed in the Li Chi as a symbol for certain seasons but this Classic never insists that they must appear on any particular date. Liu AN appeared to be the first one to make the remark that cicadas begin to sing on lishia (approximately June 21) and hence he might be regarded as stressing the im- portance of some particular date. But even in this case he did not say what would happen if the emergence should fail on this</page><page sequence="23">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 297 date. Furthermore he might be right for the particular region he had in mind. 76. But it was perhaps in these earlier statements that the later assumptions took their roots. The following statement is found in the Gee Chung Chou Su (Books from the Grave of GEE): Five days after Cancer, the diau should begin to sing: If the diau does not sing on this day, it indicates that the nobles of the court are neglecting their duty. The han-diau should sing on the day of Leo. If the han-diau does not sing on this day, it indicates that the officials do not care much for the welfare of the state. 77. The author here did not explain why the nobles and the officials should be held responsible for the abnormality of these insects. TSENG SHUAN, a great scholar of the Han dynasty, gave us some hint as to the way of reasoning in his Yi Tung Kwa Lien. He wrote: Under the variation of the upper nine of goh (one of the variations in the Book of Change), the seasonal cicada should begin to sing. If it fails to sing, the whole country will be full of supersitious rumors. The reason is that the cicadas are the symbols of language; for they always sing on time. Now suppose that when the right time approaches, they do not sing. That means that when they sing, they will be out of time. Consequently this abnormality will give rise to these rumors. 78. To those who are acquainted with logic, such reasoning, of course, would appear childish. But it may be pointed out that this type of insect fallacy was evidently very prevalent during the Han dynasty and that it was not limited to the cicadas alone. Government officials were held responsible for the outbreak of any insects. It was during this period that WANG TSUNG wrote his famous Essay on Insect Fallacy. 79. The relation between the emergence of the cicadas and the weather conditions seems to be much better understood by the common people. There is a saying among the farmers that if the cicadas sing before Cancer, the heat of the coming summer will become intolerable. Another one in Soochow states that, when the cicadas begin to sing, it is time for the paddy rice to show awns. These rural sayings, based upon the observation of generations, do seem to contain some grain of truth. Another saying, also common in Kiangsu, asserts that if the cicadas did not sing during the fifth month, there would be many ills for the babies. To a certain extent, this assertion may be also true. If</page><page sequence="24">298 G. KAN-CHIH LIU an insect fails to appear at the time when it should, the fact indicates that the weather must be somehow abnormal and abnormal weather is in general detrimental to health, especially that of the children. 8o. In addition to all these references on the life history of cicadas, there is another point which should be mentioned in this connection. This is the popular belief that the cicadas were more numerous in a leap year than in a normal one. How this belief came into being is not clear. It was first recorded by Lu JIN in his Lien Peh Tsa Chi (Miscellaneous Notes of LIEN PEH). This author went so far as to say that he had checked it and found it correct. However, since the way of his checking is not known, one may assume that his conclusion was perhaps drawn more from his own impression than from anything else and that his impression might be influenced by his belief in this popular assumption. Of course, as we know today, the number of insects varies somewhat from year to year but it is difficult to conceive that this variation should have anything to do with the leap year. 8i. From this brief review of the Chinese literature on the life history of cicadas, one sees a parallel development of the human mind both in the East and in the West. Although long before Christ the fact was known to ARISTOTLE that cicadas arose only by the breeding of antecedent cicadas and not by spontaneous generation, yet people in Europe still continue to believe that they are born again in the spring of the cuckoo's saliva and in the morning of the dew of aurora. 6.- The feeding habits of cicadas 82. In Things Chinese (I904) J. D. BALL describes a female cicada as eating voraciously of the green leaves and then laying their eggs on the branches, whence the newly hatched young bore into the substance of the tree until they reach the ground (vide MYERS' Insect Singers, p. 37). BALL'S version is not known to the present wvriter. It is possible that this American author reverses the American popular habit of using the term " locust " for the cicada. BALL'S story reminds the present writer of a</page><page sequence="25">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 299 figure for locust in the San Tsai Tu Hui, or Book of Nature as it is known in English. 83. To the ancient Chinese, cicadas drank only dew and ate only wind. Thus Liu AN wrote, " Silkworms eat but do not drink; cicadas drink but do not eat; and mayflies neither drink nor eat." Why cicadas could not eat was even explained as due to their lack of strength. Ko TSUNG-PI went further to say, " the fact that the cicadas excrete only liquid, not solid, should serve to prove that the ancient people were right when they asserted that these insects lived on dew and wind only." This argument, however, rather tends to show that this opinion was probably not universal. Otherwise, Ko TSUNG-PI would not produce this liquid excretion to prove it. It is interesting to notice that Ho YI-SHING did not say anything on this subject. On the other hand, most of the ancient Chinese perhaps never suspected that these insects could cause them much damage both by feeding and by egg-laying. 7. - Distribution 84. The problem of distribution of cicadas evidently also offered some curiosity for the ancient Chinese. This is shown by the fact that the range of some of the commoner ones, like the tsar-tchen and the hui-ku, was fairly well known. Furthermore, books, like the Local Dialect, where the author usually pointed out how the same insect was known under different names in different localities, may be regarded as records of distribution. 85. What is especially interesting to us is that the absence of cicadas in certain localities was also discussed. Thus Li Su, as mentioned before, stated that there were no cicadas in the northwest because the winter there was too severe. Before Li Su, Li MENG-YANG also made the remark that there were no fireflies and cicadas in Daliang but stated that these insects were found in Peking. The reason for their presence in one place and their absence in another, according to the opinion of this author, was either climatic or geological. 86. There are two localities which were formerly known as Daliang; one is the capital of the Honan province and the other a town about ten miles northwest of Tien Tseng Shien in Shansi.</page><page sequence="26">300 G. KAN-CHIH LIU It appears to be more likely that the Daliang of Li MENG-YANG was the former, namely Kaifeng, which was the capital of the Sung dynasty. This city is on the south bank of the Yellow River and is situated in a region which is covered with the well-known loess and, so far as the present writer is aware, the insect fauna in its neighborhood is rather sparse. But the present writer was there during the early part of spring and might have been out of season. It is hoped that those who have the opportunity to visit this famous historical city during the summer will check whether Li MENG-YANG was right in his remark. 8. - Cicadas and other organisms 87. Records on the relation between cicadas and other organisms are also found in Chinese literature. Among the lower plants, the tchen-hua (cicada flower), the nymphs infected with the fungus Cordyceps, was first recorded about the sixth century and later illustrated in a number of works, like the Cheng Lei Pentsao. The best description of this infected nymph is given by SUNG CHI (998-i06i) who, in his Yi Tu Fang Wu Chi (Native Products of Szechuan), writes: " When autumn comes, those cicadas which fail to transform will become flowered. The head is about one or two inches long and the color is bluish-yellow." SU SUNG, the author of the Illustrated Pentsao, appears to be more specific. He makes the remark that these tchen-hua are produced in Szechuan and that they are cicadas with a horn on the head which looks like a flowery hat. 88. Tchen-hua, however, is only a local name and used mostly only in the medical world. The name by which it is much better known in classical literature is the tung-tchang-shia-tsao which means " insects in winter but grasses in summer." The present writer has some specimens from Mt. Omei and the fungus was identified by Dr. D. H. LINDER of the Harvard University as probably Cordyceps sabolifera Hill. 89. Among the vascular plants, willow is the best known because it is the tree mentioned to be haunted by the tchen both in the Herbal and in the Book of Odes. But elms, locusts, mul- berry, and cherry were also reported to be visited by these insects. During the sixteenth century Li MENG-YANG made the remark</page><page sequence="27">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 30I that pines were purposely avoided by the cicadas. This remark is rather at variance with what we know today for cicadas in other countries. For instance, Terpnosia vacau OLIVIER was reported to be so restricted to the pine in Japan that it has earned the Japanese name, " mutsummushi." But Li MENG-YANG might be right for the particular region he spoke of. He was a native of Chingyang, Kansu. go. The so-called " flea locust," mentioned by DONOVAN, is not known to the present writer. DONOVAN was the first European entomologist to write a book on Chinese insects. Ac- cording to MYERS (Insect Singers, p. i6o), DONOVAN stated that this cicada had been observed to fly among the ash trees, bore many holes in them, and, when the manna had oozed out, returned and carried it off. 9I. For the relation with animals, TSCHOU CHI (I92-23 2) gave a good account in his fu, of which the following is an extract I (cicada) hide myself among the dense leaves of the mulberry tree but I am always anxious for my safety from the birds and the mantis. If I fly away and hover around in the open air, then there is danger of the spider's web. If I fly low and try to take refuge in the underbrush, I am open to the attack at any moment by the vermin among the grasses. With the purpose of avoiding all these dangers, I thought it safer to betake myself to live near the human abode. Alas, the urchins are always hot on my heels. 92. Here one finds an excellent case showing how the scho- lasticists in China would twist a good paper with their fanciful ideas. TSCHOU CHI had many fu on insects. He was evidently keenly interested in nature. But the fact that he was known not to be on good terms with his brother, the emperor of the Wei dynasty, led some Chinese to believe that this fu on cicada was only a description of his own situation. This fu is one of the important papers on Chinese tettigology and we shall have occasion to refer to it again. 93. In addition to this fu on the relation between the cicada and animals, a scene showing a mantis attempting to kill a cicada was indirectly described in an anecdote of TSAI YI (I33-I92). The following is the story as it appears in the Chin Shu, or Annals of the Chin dynasty: 94. While TSAI YI was in Chenliu, he was invited to a dinner party. He went there accordingly and, on arrival, heard somebody playing the lyre inside. TSAI Yi was an expert on this musical instrument and so he stopped outside and listened.</page><page sequence="28">302 G. KAN-CHIH LIU To his great surprise, he read from the music that there was murder in it. He could not understand why such a thing should be connected with a dinner party but he decided better not to enter the house. So he went away again. As soon as the host was informed of the strange action of his famed guest, he went after him and wanted to find out why. TSAI Yi told him frankly what he had heard. All the guests were alarmed. Then the lyre player came forward and said, " When I was playing, I happened to see a scene in which a mantis was attempting to kill a cicada. The cicada was about to fly away while the mantis was moving its head forward and backward and hesitating. I was anxious lest the cicada might escape before the mantis struck. Is that what you call murder? " 95. To appreciate this story, one has to be acquainted with the Chinese theory on music. The Chinese believe that whatever one has in mind is always expressed in his music and hence a real musician can always tell the mental state of a player. As will be shown later the relation between the cicada and the mantis has become almost a biblical case in China. 96. The way in which a huge cicada was besieged by ants was recorded by CHUNG SHING who lived during the Ming dynasty. This author related that the cicada was simply helpless among a swarm of these marauders and was rescued only after one of his friends decided to take side with the poor victim. 97. Both the chameleon and the frog were also mentioned as predators on the cicadas. The former was observed during the fourth century by Ts'ui PAO who stated that this reptile is very skilful in ascending trees to catch these insects. It may be of interest to notice that in a recent paper on " Some Insects accepted by the American Chameleon," the cicada was not mentioned by MCCLURE in his list (Ent. News, XLIX, p. z52). 98. The frog as a predator on cicadas was mentioned in Pai Su Lu (Notes from a Summer Resort) by YEH MENG-DEH (1076-i184). The following is the story: YEN YUAN-SHIEN was the mayor of Hio Chou (a district in Anhwei). One day during an excursion to the River Wo, he saw a frog climbing up a tree and attempting to catch a cicada. The amphibian did succeed in its attempt. But the insect was too big for the opening of its mouth and could not be swallowed all at once. They struggled and, as a result, both fell in to the river. 9. - The aquatic environment of cicadas 99. The Cicadidae are decidedly adaptive, but they have in no degree accom- plished that conquest of freshwater stations credited to them by an enthusiastic if somewhat uncritical student of the group (BUCKTON). The Australian " aquatic</page><page sequence="29">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 303 cicada " mentioned by him as exhibited at the Entomological Society of London is an orthopteron, Tettix australia WALKER. ioo. The above is a statement made by J. C. MYERS about the aquatic relation of the cicadas. In Chinese literature one finds several references on this subject. One of them may be explained as due to terminological confusion. WEN Tzu, a contemporary of CoNFucius, during the course of a philosophical discussion, made the remark that everything returns whence it comes. To support his thesis, he pointed out that the birds will return to their nests, the rabbits to their dens, the foxes die with their heads towards the mountain, and the han-chiang always hover over the water. Han-chiang, as mentioned before, was generally understood to be a cicada. But in this case, it was probably a dragonfly. ioi. The statement made by Su SHIH (1036-iioi) on the aquatic relation of the cicadas was obviously the result of his own confusion. He wrote: " According to my observation, there are many aquatic worms which climb up the bank where there are big trees. Some of these worms emerge as cicadas." This statement was made in support of Kou HUNG'S theory of spontaneous generation of cicadas. But in this case, SU SHIH'S observation was evidently confused. He might have actually observed a cicada emerging in the same place as other worms and thought that the nymph of these terrestial insects also comes from the water. But the following account is rather difficult to explain: 1o2. A fisherman near Tsing Lung Tseng caught a crab from the river. It had all the looks of a crab with legs and pincers and there was nothing strange about it. It was duly prepared and served. When the carapace was removed, however, the inside of the crab was found to be ready to transmute into a cicada. I have not seen the object myself. According to what I know, the head and the abdomen of a crab do show some close resemblance to those of a cicada. It is possible that such thing might happen. 103. This remark was included by Fu HUNG in his Monographs on Crabs (1059). Judging by its contents, this author was not the fantastic type. Moreover, his comparison between the crustacean and the cicada shows that he did have some under- standing of the morphology of both. The only possible explan- ation for his account of this strange transmutation lies in the fact that he had not seen the object himself and it is pos-</page><page sequence="30">304 G. KAN-CHIH LIU sible that what he heard might not have been the literal truth. 104. With the aquatic environment of the cicadas, we approach the end of the biological tettigology in China. From the above review, one sees what the early Chinese knew or thought they knew about the various biological phases of these insects. By comparing the general situation with that in Europe, one cannot fail to notice the parallelism of the intellectual development in these two cases. Why the outline of the growth curve should be similar is an interesting topic for speculation but it does not come within the scope of the present work. In the next section we will discuss the uses of cicadas as found by the Chinese. B. - ECONOMIC TETTIGOLOGY IN CHINA Io5. In Chinese cosmology man is always the lord of the universe. As shown in the common expression, " san tsai" (heaven, earth, and man), his position is next only to that of heaven and earth and it is for his benefit, so it is generally believed, that all other things in the universe are created. With this cosmology, let us see what part the cicadas play in Chinese economy. io6. There are four uses the Chinese have found for the cicadas. Not all of these are monopolized by the Chinese. The uses made of cicadas as a food, as a drug, and for entertainment seem to be universal. What appears to be purely Chinese is the utilization of cicadas in the process of ginger pickling. All these points will be discussed below. I.- Cicadas as food 107. The utilization of cicadas as food is perhaps one of the oldest customs in China, and it is possible that it may still exist in certain sections of the country, especially in the south. There is reason to believe that as food these insects were probably highly esteemed in CONFUCIUS' time (551-479 B.C.) and that the custom was more common than it is now. This assumption can be inferred from the fact that the custom was frankly put in black and white in the Record of Rites which is one of the most respected Classics.</page><page sequence="31">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 305 io8. The particular food-species mentioned in this Classic, according to the opinion of later scholars, is the tsar-tchen, or what we know in science C. pustulatus, the same species used in medicine. But the book does not say how these insects were prepared and which part of the body was especially favored when they were served as food. The only reference on the way of cooking was baking which was mentioned by TSCHOU CHI in his fu. The part of the body of the insect specially favored by the Chinese Epicureans was not recorded. According to present custom with other insects, such as the well-known pickled aquatic beetles of Canton, Kwangsi, and Fukien, the part that is actually consumed is the musculature of the thoracic section. By analogy, one may assume that the thoracic section of the cicada was also the part favored because the musculature of these insects is even better developed than that of the beetle. i09. This food custom appeared to be gradually abandoned and was perhaps nearly forgotten by the sixth century; for TAO HUNG-CHING of this century referred to it as an ancient custom. Nevertheless, it might still exist in the south where, as the present writer found in 1933, a great variety of insects, even the mole- crickets, are commonly accepted as food by the native Chinese. i10. The nymphs of the cicadas were known to be used as food in Europe. There is no reference in Chinese literature whether or not the same custom also occurred in China. The only case known is that of the tchen-hua of Mt. Omei where these infected nymphs are eagerly sought by the native Chinese and are generally used as an ingredient of meat broth. These tchen-hua are believed to be very nutritious and are collected by poor people, strung like beads on a grass stalk, and sold to the pilgrims and travellers for a few cents a dozen. The nymphs and the fungi are generally stewed together. i i I. It is quite possible, however, that the cicada nymphs also entered the diet of the ancient Chinese. This possibility may be assumed from the fact that the white grubs are known to be enjoyed by some Chinese even today and that, in early times, no strict distinction was made between the nymphal stages of the Cicadidae and the Scarabaeidae. It may be mentioned here that the so-called " kwei-hua-tchen " or " cassia cicada," a pickled insect food sold on the market in Canton and some other 20</page><page sequence="32">306 G. KAN-CHIH LIU southern cities, is not a cicada but a Nepa which is one of the aquatic Hemiptera. 2. - Cicadas in ginger pickling 112. This peculiar formula was mentioned by Su SHIH in his Wu Lei Shiang Kan Chi (On the Reactions between Different Objects). The formula is simple. The author writes: " In pickling ginger, put some cicada exuvia in the vessel: Treated this way, even the old ginger will not be fibrous." Ii3. There are many such formulae among the Chinese rural folks who have to find some way for the preservation of their perishable agricultural products. Some of them are really inge- nious but are beyond the scope of the present work. In regard to this one for ginger pickling, it is possible that the consistency of the roots might be affected by the chemical contents of the exuviae as the formula claims. But this method does not seem to be very well known. 3. - Cicadas for entertainments 114. The cicadas are essentially a toy for the children. Time and place do not seem to make any difference. They provide one of the best entertainments for the schoolboys today as they did in the past. The hunting for these insects by children two thousand years ago, as described by TsCHOU CHI in hisfu, remains unchanged until today and what Fu SHIEN (239-294) did for his son during the third century would not be unusual for a father of our own time. Fu SHIEN wrote a number of fu on insects. In his fu on cicadas, he made the remark in the preface: " I have two reasons for planting cherry trees in my courtyard. They have more shade than any other tree and the fruits they bear always ripen earlier than any other fruits. During the summer cicadas frequently come to sing among their branches. One day I saw one and, with the purpose of amusing our little boy, I had it glued down." That the children in the past were just as enthusiastic about catching cicadas as they are today may be inferred from the fact that WANG TSUNG was marked out as unusual when he, as a boy, did not attempt to catch these insects.</page><page sequence="33">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 307 It5. But there is some difference in the degree of interest shown on these insects in different localities. In south China, as in Nanhai, Kwangtung, and in the Yangtze valley, as in Wu- chang, Hupeh, the insects are actually commercialized for their musical accomplishment. So far as the present writer is aware, no such custom is known in the north except a record in the Ching Yi Lu. TAO Ku, the author of this delightful book, writes: During the Tang dynasty (6i8-907), when summer came, those who were unemployed would make a living by collecting cicadas and selling them on the street of Changan under the name of tsing-ling-loo (Music from the green woods). These insects were eagerly bought by women and children who put them in cages and hung the cages in the window. Later there developed a special game called " shuan-tchang-sheh " (Fairy Insect Game), in which the insects were brought together and allowed to sing. The winner was the one whose insect outsang all others. i i6. Changan was the capital of the Tang dynasty and is now called Sian, the capital of Shensi province. The present writer was there for a whole summer in 1934 but no such custom came to his notice. It is possible that this cicada game was gradually replaced during the Sung dynasty (960-I127) by the cricket game which is more exciting and appears to be very popular today in this capital of the Tang dynasty. The cicadas are not known to be commercialized in north China where the custom apparently has died out. 4. - Cicadas as drugs 117. If the economic value of our insects has depreciated in other respects as mentioned above, the case in the medical world is entirely different. Here its usage is not only well preserved but has been developed far beyond its original scope both in regard to the number of species employed and to the kinds of maladies for which it is applied. This development can be easily brought to light with a little comparative study of the medical writings from different periods. i i8. As we know today, the imago, the exuvia, and the nymph infected with fungus are all acceptable to the Chinese physicians. The preference, however, is always given to the exuvia. Those who are not familiar with the historical uses of this insect in medicine may be led to think that the exuvia is the original form.</page><page sequence="34">308 G. KAN-CHIH LIU This, however, is not the case, for the original form is the imago. In the Shen Nung Pentsao Ching, one of the oldest materia medica in China generally known to the English world as the Herbal, only the imago was mentioned as one of the twenty-five insects used in medicine. It may be mentioned that there are 365 drugs in this Herbal and that these are grouped into three grades: the superior, like the honey; the medium, like the cicadas; and the inferior, like the fireflies. 19. The cicada is known in this book under the name of tsar-tchen. The author states that it is to be found among the willows but does not give any description as to the insect itself. It is as late as the sixth century when it is first described by TAO HUNG-CHING as black and the largest of its kind. This description is brief but the combination of the size and the color is enough for us to identify it as C. pustulatus. TAO HUNG-CHING also states that this is the food cicada of the Li Chi. 120. From the time it was first known down to the twelfth century, this tsar-tchen was the only cicada used in medicine. But there seems to have been a gradual but unconscious change of preference from the female to the male sex. This may be inferred from an argument between Su KOoN and TAO HUNG- CHING. In his annotation, TAO HUNG-CHING stated that the tsar-tchen of the Herbal was a mute female. Su KOoN was also a famed physician who lived during the seventh century. He considered TAo HUNG-CHING'S interpretation as wrong. Accord- ing to his opinion, with all insects used in medicine, the males were always preferred and the tsar-tchen in the Herbal was simply a cicada without any implication that it was a female. It appears to the present writer that in this case each was probably speaking for the custom of his own time. 121 . Except for this unconscious shifting of preference, the tsar-tchen remained the only medicinal cicada for many centuries. As shown by the remark made by Su SUNG in his Illustrated Pentsao, it was so even during the twelfth century. But by the sixteenth century, the situation had changed. Accord- ing to Li SHIH-CHEN, in addition to this tsar-tchen, two other cicadas were also included in the apothecary supply, namely the liang-diau and the tang-diau. It is possible, however, as mentioned before, that tang-diau (0. maculaticollis), especially</page><page sequence="35">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 309 some of its varieties, might have been confused with the tsar- tchen and used accordingly before the specific differences between these two were recognized by LI SHIH-CHEN. 122. It may be mentioned here that the famous Chinese medicinal cicada, H. sanguinea, of the European scholars was not- even mentioned in any of the Chinese medical writings. This is rather an unfortunate case. There are several points peculiar about this insect. But it is probably due to the vesicating proper- ties of its tissue that it has become one of the best known in this family. A large number of eminent specialists, including DISTANT, SCHUMACHER, and MYERS, have built up a fairly large amount of literature on this insect. 123. There seems to be no question that this insect is used by the Chinese as a drug. Otherwise, this misunderstanding would not have arisen. But unfortunately it was wrongly identi- fied with a fulgorid in the Pentsao. Accordingly European scholars wrongly assumed that the cicada they knew was the cicada used by the Chinese physicians. From AMYOT (i843) down to MYERS (1929) no one has suspected that this cicada was not even mentioned in Chinese medical writings. 124. This omission may be explained in either of two ways. It might be that the medical value of this cicada is a recent discovery and consequently unknown to the earlier writers, or that it has been used in the south as a substitute for the fulgorid which is rather rare in that region. Both explanations are possible. But, as this insect appeared rather recently in European literature, there is no way to tell which of them is nearer to the truth. For further elucidation, the reader is referred to the section on Lycorma in the next family. 125. As mentioned before, in present day practice, among Chinese physicians, the preference in prescription is always given to the exuvia. MYERS wonders why this form was not included in the Pentsao Kang Mu. The reason is that he has taken over a Japanese mistake of taking the tchen-touy as the nymph and did not realize that the ch'an-t'ui is but a different Romanization of the same term in Chinese. 126. The exuvia is known in the Pentsao under the name of tchen-touy and is generally listed immediately after the imago. It did not appear in the Herbal and was mentioned during the</page><page sequence="36">310 G. KAN-CHIH LIU sixth century by TAO HUNG-CHING in his Ming I Pel Lu. Its popularity, however, grew very rapidly. By the next century, it had already reached the front and the imago was relegated to the second place. Li SHIH-CHEN made the remark that, " while people in ancient times used the imago, we today would recommend only the exuvia." Li SHIH-CHEN lived during the sixteenth century and his statement is amply borne out by the fact that, in his book, while sixteen recipes were given for the latter, the imago had only three. 127. According to the opinion in the medical world, there is no fundamental difference between these two forms. Both were said to taste salty-sweet and to be non-poisonous and inter- changeable for cases in which they were applied. The preference appears to be simply due to the ease with which the exuvia can be secured. Li SHIH-CHEN seemed to be the only one to suggest that the imago should be prescribed for internal ailments while the exuvia for dermatological treatment. Other physicians, however, did not agree with this discrimination and would gener- ally recommend the latter whenever this insect was needed. I28. In application the way of preparation is simple. The mago, according to TAO HUNG-CHING, who first paid attention to this point, should be collected during the fifth month, steamed, dried, and then kept free from dermestid infestation. For exuvia, Li SHIH-CHEN explained that it should be washed with boiled water to remove the soil and, after the appendages were removed, boiled in chiang-shiu (water which has been used for washing rice) and then kept in a dry condition. It may be mentioned that the exuviae were supposed to belong to the same species as the imago. I29. Concerning the application, evidently there was also a tremendous change. In the Herbal the insects were employed chiefly in paediatrics, namely convulsions and noctural wailing. Later in the sixth century, it was extended to the field of gynae- cology and was supposed to produce good effect in removing the congestion of mammalian glands and in hastening the dropping of the placenta in childbirth. It was even recommended for abortion. But the list still continued to grow. By the sixteenth century, the application was further expanded to cover chronic dysentery, loss of voice, inflammation of eyes, measles, abscesses,</page><page sequence="37">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 311 and other skin troubles in general. It may be pointed out, as another proof that H. sanguinea of the European scholars is not the medician cicada of the Chinese physicians, that in no case has this insect been known to be recommended for hydrophobia as maintained by European scholars. I30. Concerning the underlying principle, it is interesting to notice how the East differs from the West. In Europe these insects were used for diuretic purposes and the underlying prin- ciple, according to FABRE, was said to be the fact that these insects, when seized, would eject their urine. It was believed that this ability might be conveyed to the human system. I31. This was the European story. The Chinese used these insects for a different set of maladies and hence it is interesting to notice what they had to say for their application. On paediatrics, TAO HUNG-CHING explained: " The cicadas always begin to sing when the fifth month comes. It is popularly believed that, should these insects fail to sing on time, there will be many ailments among the babies. It is on account of this reason that the insects are employed chiefly for paediatric troubles." As mentioned before, the popular belief in the connection between the health of the children and the time of emergence of these insects does seem to contain some truth. But it is absurd to assume that these insects are the cause for ills as implied in TAO HUNG-CHING'S explanation. On noctural wailing, Li SHIH-CHEN stated: " These insects make noise only during the day time but are always silent at night. Hence they should have the ability to stop a child from crying in the evening." Thus the Chinese explanation was equally " merveilleuse de naivete." I32. For other cases, Li SHIH-CHEN also offered some general elucidation. But most of the Chinese medical terms, like the " air," the ' fire," and the " wind," are unintelligible to those who are not in their profession. In case of obstetric and dermato- logical troubles, the underlying principle seems to lie in the fact of ecdysis. It was believed that this ability of the cicada to extract itself from its old skin may be conveyed to the human system. I33. It would not serve any useful purpose to introduce here all those prescriptions for these insects as given in the Pentsao Kang Mu. Both the imago and the exuvia are used either in- dependently or in combination. As an illustration, we may cite</page><page sequence="38">312 G. KAN-CHIH LIU the one on nocturnal wailing, which, according to its author, appears to be actually efficacious: 134. For nocturnal wailing in which the child appears as if he was haunted by some evil spirit, powder the lower half of the exuvia (probably the abdominal section), mix it with wine and some mentha decoction and let the child take it. 135. In this case, it might appear that the appeasing effect is due to the wine or the mentha or both. But the author explicitly made it understood that, " if the upper half of the exuvia is taken either intentionally or by mistake, the remedy would not produce the desired effect and the child would continue to cry." If these statements are true, it appears that the effect is actually due to the insect, or that the insect at least plays an important part. I36. The last cicada drug to be mentioned is the tchen-hua, or cicada nymph infected with fungus. This nymph was figured in Cheng Lei Pentsao (i io8). According to the author of this book, these infected nymphs may be found anywhere, but in medicine those which come from the grooves of bitter bamboo are always considered as the best and should by collected during the seventh month. It may be pointed out that this fungus, as we know today, has a much wider distribution in China than was formerly supposed. But the " anywhere " in the above case probably refers only to Szechuan where the author, TANG SHEN- WEI, was born. I37. The way of preparation was given by LEI KUNG, who lived during the fifth century. According to this physician, only those nymphs with the fungus full grown but still white are acceptable. These are hung to dry on the east corner under the roof. Then, after removing the soil and the " shell," boil in chiang-shui for a whole day. In the evening, bake and powder it for future use. I38. It is not clear whether this " shell " refers to the fungus, to the nymph, or to some other thing. The medical value of this material is accredited to be the same as that of the other two forms, namely the exuvia and the imago. But, in addition, the infected nymph was also recommended for malaria.</page><page sequence="39">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 3I3 5. - Methods of collection 139. The various methods for collecting cicadas, as they are used by the Chinese, may be classified as either physical or mecha- nical. Both have a long history. But, while the mechanical methods have developed into various forms in different localities; the physical ones seem to have disappeared, or at least they are not very common today. I40. The light-trapping, according to Loo YUAN, the author of Erh Yah Yi (I I74), was called yao-tchen in south China. But he did not explain how this was done. The term, " yao," further- more, as it is used in Chinese, is rather ambiguous. It may mean " flashing " or a " fixed light, " as used today in light- traps; or a " portable light " as used by the Chinese in eel-hunting. SUN CHING, a contemporary of MENCIUS (372-289 B.C.), gave us some hint how this yao-tchen was done. He stated that, " in yao-tchen the light should be made as bright as possible and the tree should be shaken as much as one can. However, if the light is not bright enough, there is no use in shaking the tree." I4I. Light trappings are known to be still practiced in some parts in the Orient. In Malay, according to MYERS, cicadas are caught at night like moths. Judging from our present-day know- ledge on the habits of these insects in general, how profitable this method will be is open to question because, as a rule, the cicadas do not come to light readily. The light-trap used by the ancient Chinese does not appear to be similar to this one. I42. The light-trap used in the lower part of Siam is different. According to W. W. SKEAT, " Two or three natives gather to- gether at night round a brightly burning woodfire, one of them holding a light torch. The others clap their hands at regular intervals, and the cicadas, attracted by the noise and guided by the light, fly down and settle upon the people as they stand by the fire." I43. This method is also practiced in the northern part of the Malaysian Peninsula and appears to be very close to the one mentioned by the Chinese philosopher. The Siamese seem to have a special liking for the cicadas. According to MYERS, they even have a " cicada clapper," which is made of a split piece of</page><page sequence="40">314 G. KAN-CHIH LIU bamboo for catching these insects. It is interesting to compare the statement of SUN CHING with the experiment made by AN- NANDALE (I9oo). According to MYERS (Insect Singers, p. I99), " ANNANDALE was at pains to ascertain whether possibly it was only the light which drew them (cicadas), but upon his ceasing to clap, only one settled on his own coat, and ten on that of his friend who kept up the noise." I44. The present writer is inclined to think that the light- trap used in Siam was derived perhaps from the one used in ancient China or it was the one referred to by SUN CHING and Loo YUAN because Siam was formerly considered as a part of China. Otherwise, this method, so far as the present writer is aware, is not known to be practiced by the Chinese today. The case with the mechanical methods is different. Many forms are known to be in use. The one described by BUCKTON may be called tickling. According to this author, boys in Foochow use a bamboo pole with a cleft at the tip and the cicadas are tickled until a leg is entangled in the slit. This method evidently takes some patience and skill. I45. One of the methods used by children in Shingtien, Hunan, may be called netting. The net is about the size of an ordinary hair-net and is generally made by sisters or mothers at the special request of the children. It is flat, fastened to a pole, and closed by a noose running around the border. As soon as the cicada is caught inside the net, the net is closed by pulling the noose. It is not clear, however, how the net is attached to the pole, I46. These methods of tickling and netting are more or less localized. The form that is most common is what we may call sticking, a method in which the insect is caught by touching with some sticky material on a pole. This is an old method which was even connected with a few prominent figures in Chinese history. The following account involving CoNFucius is found in the work of CHUANG CHOU: 147. One day while CONFUCIUS was in the Kingdom of Tscho (Hunan and Hupeh), he took a stroll in the woods with his disciples. He saw a hunchback who was so skilful in collecting cicadas that he caught these insects as if he was simply picking. CONFUCIUS was very much impressed and asked the old man whether he was simply skilful or he had his own way. To this inquiry, the old man said, " Yes, I have my own way. During the fifth and the sixth month,</page><page sequence="41">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 315 if I can hold two pellets on the top of my pole, frequently I miss a few; if three, about one-tenth; but if I can hold five pellets, I do not miss anything. I hold my arm like a dead branch and I stand as firm and motionless as that citrous tree. The attraction in the universe may be great. But I see only the wings of my cicada. I do not look to the right, nor to the left, and I would not exchange the whole world for the wings of my insect. How can I miss? " On hearing this, CoNFUcius turned to his disciples and told them that by concentration one can always achieve wonder. 148. The moral aspect of this anecdote does not concern us here. What is of particular interest to us is the detailed account of how the catching is carried out, especially how the adhesion is applied. The only thing to be regretted is that the author did not mention what material these adhesives were made of. So far as the present writer is aware, this art seems to have been lost. 149. The method described by TSCHOU CHI during the third century was probably not much different from what is generally used today. The following account is an extract from his fu mentioned before: I (cicada) hide myself among the branches of a tall tree and think I am safe. Then there is always the danger from those tricky boys, whose sight is keen and who can climb like monkeys. They walk softly towards me as if they dare not disturb my peace. Then I feel a light touch of their long and slender pole. I am scared and I try to free myself. But the more I struggle, the more I am entangled. I5o. This extract tells us vividly how the whole procedure was carried out. It differs from the one just mentioned in many important respects but is very similar to those which are known to be in use today in many parts of China except perhaps in the kinds of materials used as adhesives. I51. The one reported by BALL for south China is said to be a kind of bird-lime which is said to be made from the ashes of some " Chinese fir," mixed with glutinous cooked rice and water. BALL did not specify where he noticed this method. The glutinous rice, after being cooked and pounded, is very sticky. But there is no way to identify this " Chinese fir," unless it is known where this term is in use. In Kwangtung and Kwangsi, the term " tsung," which is generally taken for the English " fir," is common- ly applied by the native Chinese to various species of pines. 152. In most localities, the adhesive used for gluing is some kind of resinous secretion. In Wuchang, Hupeh, the one com- monly employed is either the common turpentine or peach gum;</page><page sequence="42">3I6 G. KAN-CHIH LIU the latter is also employed in Shingtien, Hunan. In Nanhai, Kwangtung, where the cicadas are collected, caged, and sold on markets for their musical performance, liupikiau, an adhesive made from the hides of cattle by cooking, is the one commonly employed; in Soochow, tung oil is sometimes used; while in Wusih, even the mienking, or wheat gluten, is frequently employed by the children as a sticky material for catching these insects. Thus it appears that any kind of sticky material can be used for gluing purposes. 153. Now we have discussed how the Chinese with their cosmology try to make the cicadas fill their stomachs, cure their ailments, help preserve their agricultural products, and even entertain them with their acoustic accomplishments. Furthermore, how some of these various attempts have been successful and some unsuccessful, how the art of collection was professionalized and how the insects were even commercialized. The materials in the next section are quite diversified. They range from the aesthetic in its strictest sense to pure superstition. Although a few of *them are instructive, as they tend to show what under- standing the Chinese have of nature, most of them possess no scientific value. They are placed under one heading for the simple reason that they all may be regarded as reflections of some emotional disturbances. In other words, we are going to see what the Chinese thought or felt about the cicadas. C. - AESTHETIC TETTIGOLOGY IN CHINA I54. In the last two sections we have discussed what the Chinese knew about the cicadas and what uses they have found in them. In this section we will include information tending to show in various respects how the Chinese felt or thought about these insects. Here again we find many points in common between the East and the West. i. - Cicadas in decoration I 55. Similarly symbolic was the widespread occurrence of the tettix as a symbol of autochthony among the nobles of Athens. The cicada came from the tettigo-</page><page sequence="43">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 317 metra which visibly arose from the soil, undeniably " born of the earth. " The symbol took the concrete form of a golden brooch furnished with a spiral portion which served to hold together a braid or lock of hair. Scions of nobility, coiffured thus, were tettigophori. A similar costum prevailed in Ionic Asia Minor. 156. The above quotation is what MYERS writes of the European custom of using cicadas in decoration (Insect Singers, p. I 2). There was also a custom of cicada decoration in China and, in one case, the insect also took the form of a golden image. But, besides some slight variation in the way of wearing, this custom in China differs from that in Europe both in its under- lying principle and in its other developments. I 57. The Chinese custom appeared to be an old one too, but no record is known until the third century. Obviously it had two origins; that among the women, which was indigenous, and that among the men, which was imported. In the case of women, it took various forms such as the " feitchen," the " tchen- ping," and the " mengkiatchen." The tchenping was invented by MO CHUN-SHU, a lady at court during the reign of Emperor WEN of the Wei dynasty (22I-226). It was a kind of tresses or curls on the temples and was said to look like the wings of cicadas. Hence it was called tchenping, or cicada tress. It was not known when this form of coiffure disappeared but the term is still retained in literature for descriptive purposes. i58. The mengkiatchen was a kind of design in the form of cicadas painted according to the style as it was devised by Queen MENG. But the present writer has not been able to ascertain who this queen was. The feitchen, or flying cicada, appeared to be a kind of headwear used by the lady. Judging from the following account, this headwear appeared to be quite popular but perhaps rather expensive during the Tang dynasty: 159. Tu Pu generally presented his wife to his guests when they came to visit him. One day WEI YING-WVU called and he introduced his wife as usual. Later in the evening when WEI YING-WU returned home, he asked his wife to send some feitchen to Mvrs. Tu as a present for her embellishment. i6o. Tu Pu (7I2-770) was one of the best poets China has ever produced. He was rated by the Chinese scholars in general as high as Li PEH, one of his contemporaries, but he was not so successful as the latter in ingratiating himself with the court. Although known as an official in the government, he lived in poverty for most of his life. In introducing his wife to his guests,</page><page sequence="44">3 I8 G. KAN-CHIH LIU he was quite unconventional because this was not the general custom in China. On account of his poverty, however, his wife apparently did not have the same means to satisfy her vanity as other ladies did. WEI YING-WU was also known as a good poet. i6i. In all these feminine decorations, the custom appears to be based entirely upon a pure sense of beauty and probably originated from a verse in the Book of Odes where the head of the cicada was compared to the face of a beautiful princess of the Kingdom of Ch'i. In men the cicada decoration was intro- duced by the Hu, or barbarians, and it is highly possible that the Chinese custom came from the same origin as that of the Greeks. The term, " hu," generally referred to a certain tribe of people in -central Asia; or according to the opinion of some Chinese, the Chinese " hu " is the same as the English " Hun." The Chinese custom was also based upon the idea of nobility, which was, of course, modified and not in the Greek sense of autochthony. In Tseh Foo Chi (Chariots and Garments), Hsu KWANG (352-425) made the remark that " the reason why cicadas were used by courtiers in the decoration of their hats is that these insects are considered as noble. Instead of eating anything, they drink only dew." I62. This was, however, only Hsu KWANG's explanation. The one propounded by Ts'ui PAO, one of his contemporaries, is somewhat different. In his Ku Ching Chu, Ts'ui PAO writes: The reason why the tiau (sable) is used in decoration is that this animal does not display its true virtue. Outwardly it looks as if it were very pliant but in reality it is very firm. The reason for using the tchen as a decoration is that this insect is noble but humble and knows its time. It behooves officials to behave themselves as humble people and to watch always for the right moment to act. No matter how extensive is their knowledge and no matter how great is their valor and their physical strength, they should keep such virtues to themselves and should not make a show of them. I63. The tiau and the tchen were generally mentioned in combination. In the original text of Ts'ui PAO's statement, the character for tiau is a sable but, according to present day usage, its pronunciation is exactly the same as that for the cicada. The fact that these two characters, the tiau and the tchen, were generally mentioned in combination in connection with dressing makes it appear that the tiau originally might refer to the cicada which was replaced later by the sable.</page><page sequence="45">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 319 i64. During the sixth century, the custom seemed to have become very popular, and it is from a record of this period that we learn what these cicadas in decoration were. The story is about the personal idiosyncrasy of Emperor SHUANTI of the Hou Chou, who reigned for only one year (579): The emperor thought that he was a god himself. He wanted to emphasize that he was different and did not like other people to wear the same thing as he did. He was used to carry a ribbon and had a gold cicada on his hat. For this reason, if he saw a gold cicada on the military cap of his warriors or a ribbon carried by the nobles of his court, he generally would have such articles removed. i65. Thus in this case the cicada in the Chinese custom was also a gold image just as in the Greek and was perhaps also some- what in the form of a brooch. What was different, however, is that, instead of being worn directly on the hair, it was carried on the hat or cap. It is not known when this custom died out. No further reference on this custom is found in literature from later ages. 2.- The sound of cicadas i66. With regard to the reactions to the sound of cicadas, MYERS tells us that in Europe the Greeks and the Latins differed. It appears that on this matter it is difficult to make any general statement. How an individual would react depends upon a number of factors. In addition to the specific sounds themselves, some pleasant and some unpleasant, both personal temperament and the mental state of a listener at a particular moment must be also taken into consideration. This is well borne out by the fact that, while one Chinese would think of the sound as sweet, another might condemn it as absolutely raucous. i67. There is no doubt that the Chinese on the whole like the sound of cicadas. Otherwise they would not buy them, cage them, and keep them at home. The large number of poems on these insects is another proof of the Chinese appreciation. In the Book of Odes, one of the poets was so successful in expressing his own appreciation that even today we still share his joy when he was listening to the singing of a cicada in a willow tree. I68. This general appreciation, however, did not prevent others from taking a different view. The noise of hui-ku must</page><page sequence="46">320 G. KAN-CHIH LIU have been especially annoying to CoNFucius when he made the remark that the sound of these insects, even miles away from the mountain, still kept ringing in his ears. He was perhaps attempt- ing some serious thinking and, with the sonorous noise of these insects in his ears, found it difficult to concentrate. But even in the same Book of Odes, the raucous chorus of the diau and the tang was employed by another poet to describe the effect of the diabolical tumult of a mob. These few instances suffice to show that some Chinese did take a different view. But the following case, as given in the Shih Ling Yen Yu (Swallow Jargon from Rock Forest) by YEH MENG-DEH (0I76-I I84) is rather exceptional : 169. When SUNG Su-Yo was the head of the army, he had his subordinates make sure that during summer no cicadas were allowed to sing in his presence. Failure in this duty meant heavy thrashing and many were thus punished. This strange order gradually became intolerable and the complaints began to spread until they reached the emperor. It was generally thought that the general had a strong dislike for the song of these insects. 170. One day when asked by the emperor whether this accusation was true, he frankly admitted it. To the emperor, this order was rather unreasonable. But the general replied, " I know it myself but I have my reasons. The fundamental discipline of an army lies in the strict observance of its order. I am a general in peace and there is no way to make my men see that my order, no matter what it is, must be always strictly obeyed. This is the reason why I resort to this cicada chasing. I know it is very difficult to stop the insect from singing but I can at least have them all driven away. I7i. The explanation, of course, is plausible, especially to an emperor. But it is fairly safe to say that it was beyond the under- standing of the common people. At least, unless the action was explained by the actor himself, no one would ever suspect that the care-free cicada should play a part in Chinese military strategy. But, as will be shown later, there is one more case in which these insects become connected with military affairs in China. 3. - Cicadas in allegory I72. Cicadas provide many allegorical references in Chinese literature. They were frequently referred to in the course of a philosophical discussion to impress the audience with what the speaker had in mind. The sound of the hui-ku and that of the tang-diau, for instance, were used by CoNFucius to illustrate the difference between the hustling in a market and the tumult in the</page><page sequence="47">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 321 government; the latter being much worse than the former. CHUANG CHOU, in showing the impossibility for an ordinary people to believe or understand what is beyond his experience, said that there is no use to tell a hui-ku the difference between spring and autumn; the life of the insect being too short to notice the change. In other words, such differences are beyond their experience. The same idea was differently expressed by HUAN KWAN in his Yen Teh Lun (On Iron and Salt). HUAN KWAN lived about the time of SHUAN-TI (73-49 B.C.) of the Han dynasty. He made the remark that " to refuse to believe what one has not seen is like the cicada refusing to believe that snow is a solid." In order to explain the motive of an honest man, Kou HUNG said: "A cicada prefers to starve to death and be clean rather than to be satiated with the droppings of a dung-beetle." Such allegories are fairly common in Chinese literature. The best known, however, is the following: I73. The king of the Kingdom of Wu was preparing to invade the Kingdom of Ching. He was blind to the danger that might be brought to his own people by this long expedition; for it was higly possible that, while the army was away, the country might be subjected to a surprise attack from some other hostile neighbors. But the king was so adamant in his decision that a penalty of death was put up for those who dared to advise him against it. 174. Among his courtiers, there was a boy who was very loyal to the king but did not dare to risk his own life. Finally he discovered how to approach the subject. Early in the morning he took his bow and went into the garden. The dew was heavy and all his clothes were wet. He went there again next morning and still again on the third. But on the third morning his strange action was discovered and he was summoned to the king who said, " See, your clothes are all wet. Why do you do this? " 175. Then the boy answered: " On a tree in the garden there was a cicada which drank its dew and sang its song. It had not the least suspicion that it was being watched by a voracious mantis which was taking its position, lying close to the branch, keeping its body rigid, and planning how to get at its prey. Meanwhile the mantis did not realize that it was closely watched by a siskin which was stretching its neck and ready to peck. But the bird in its turn was obviously blind to the fact that I was going to shoot it with my arrow. These three crea- tures see the temptation in front of them only but not the danger behind them. This is why I was so interested." 176. This anecdote was given by LIu SHIANG (d. 23 B.C.) in his Shuai Yuan. Evidently it was quite well known because a similar version, with some slight modifications, is found also in the Han Shih Y Tsuan. It appears to the present writer that this story was derived probably from a story as related by CHUANG 21</page><page sequence="48">322 G. KAN-CHIH LIU CHOU, who told us how one day, while roaming in the woods, he happened to see a beautiful bird dashing right over his head, how he followed it and discovered that it was after a mantis, and that the mantis was trying to catch a cicada which sang in the shade. He further related how he himself in following the bird forgot the state ordinance and got himself into trouble with the police. It is said that the revelation of this melodrama caused him to retire into his own study and to remain there for three days without uttering a single word. I 77. CHUANG CHOU, the Taoist, was evidently a keen naturalist. In his essays on various subjects, he frequently made use of his observations on what happens in nature to illustrate his philoso- phical dissertations. The grim concatenation described in his story is familiar to those who are acquainted with the actual conditions in nature. This Chinese simile would compare favor- ably with the European fable of the cicada and the ants. CHUANG CHOU was also the inventor of the following allegory: 178. The peng is a huge bird. When it takes to its wings, which spread like clouds in the sky, it rests only occasionally during a continuous flight of six months, and the distance it covers is nine hundred thousand li. This grandeur looks silly to the cicada and the turtledove. " Why," they say, " we only hop between trees and sometimes we cannot even reach them and have to alight on the ground. What is the use of taking to wings for such a long distance in order to reach the south ? " 179. The moral of this allegory is to show the folly of judging others' conduct by the standard we accept ourselves. These two cases suffice to show how skilful this naturalist handles the facts he observed in nature to demonstrate the strength of his personal philosophy. In connection with these allegories, the " king tchen touy ko " may be also mentioned here. This phrase means the shedding of the shell of the golden cicada and is a technical term in Chinese military science. The manceuvre it implies is to deceive the enemy with some faked sign under which the main army may be safely moved away. It is not a common expression in orthodox literature but is very frequent in novels. 4. - Cicadas in poetry i 8o. China is a country full of poets and one of their favorite insects is the cicada, which has been written about in various</page><page sequence="49">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 323 moods and in all the styles the Chinese have been able to devise, such as the fu, the ts'an, the tzih, and the shik. From a purely literary point of view, some of them are really exquisite. But as the contents are in general more or less sentimental and their literary beauty could not be easily preserved outside their original language, it is deemed advisable to limit the following discussion to those which are of some special interest to us. i8i. The fu on the five virtues of cicada, as mentioned by MYERS, should claim our attention first. The way of thinking, as it is expressed here, is more or less representative of that of the Chinese literary class as a whole. It is written by Lu YUN (262-303) who is introduced by LAFCADIO HEARN to the English world under the Japanese name, RIKU-UN. But the version given by HEARN from the Japanese source is far from being satisfactory. With the author known under a Japanese name, it may be difficult for those who are not familiar with the Chinese literature on these insects, to identify it with the original text. i82. The fit itself is fairly lengthy. In the preface, Lu YUN writes: There is a fu in which the five virtues of the fowl are highly praised. The cicada is just as virtuous as the fowl but nobody has paid any attention to it. This insect is civilized, pure, abstemious, thrifty, and reliable because it carries strings (antennae) on its head, limits its sustenance to dew and air, takes no food, lives under no shelter, and always appears on time. If it were dressed up with a robe and a hat, it might be rated as a gentleman. Its integrity is good enough to be that of a lord in court and that of a man in society. In fact it is the most virtuous of all insects. i83. The main body of the fu is only an elaboration of these five points in rhyme. The motive for writing it, as expressed by the author himself, is rather amusing. But the Chinese poets appear to be quite fond of this kind of work. For instance, there is a fiu on the five virtues of the firefly and a fu on the six virtues of the silkworm. To a certain extent, this type of work may be regarded as an expression of the Chinese appreciation of nature. I 84. Lady writers are comparatively rare in China. Therefore the fu on cicada by Lady TSCHOU is a precious work. Lady TSCHOU was the daughter of the famed historian BAN MONG (3-S4) and her maiden name was BAN TSIAU. But she is better known under her married name TSCHOU DA Ku for her Nu Erh Ching (Bible for Women). Her fu on cicada, although brief,</page><page sequence="50">324 G. KAN-CHIH LIU shows that she had a good appreciation of nature and a general understanding of the main facts of the life of these insects. She says: " Those black insects, trivial as they are, also have their place in nature. During the hot days of summer, they broadcast their music through the air from a tall tree. They visit us when the summer wind comes and depart on the approaching of cold weather." I85. The first sentence is very beautiful and carries with it a profound insight into the core of nature. The cicada in this fu referred probably to the common C. pustulatus. Besides these two fu and those already mentioned before, some of the poems also deserve our attention. Although most of the purely literary works contain nothing but imagination and sentimentality, nonetheless, occasionally one would find that plain facts are presented in beautiful rhymed style. Thus KIANG TSUNG (519- 594), after describing the delightful scene at twilight of listening to the singing of a cicada, produces the following stanza Judging by the sound, You might think it easy to find; But when it was found, It was far from where you divined. i86. Those who have had some experience in collecting these insects would be willing to subscribe to the accuracy of this poet. The same elusive habit of the cicada was also noticed by SHEN CHUN U who lived during the sixth century. The following is an extract of the poem he wrote As the sun starts to go down, From the wild comes the soft wind; Out from among the tranquil woods, Begins the cicada to sing. While I'm list'ning in the open field, The sound seems to come from one location. But look at the confusing branches, Several places are under suspicion. i87. The above two poems are found in the Chinese Encyc- lopedia. Before leaving this topic, mention should also be made of a unique piece of literary work in China, namely the Shih Lei Fu (On Nature) of Wu Su who had participated in the compilation of the famous Tai Ping Yu Lan (987). In this book, the author had a chapter on cicadas, where all the historical references</page><page sequence="51">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 325 known to him on these insects were presented in rhymed style. This work is unique because it was intended to help the schoolboys in their study and in this respect the author certainly did a great service; for Chinese children in those early days were taught to learn everything by heart. The popularity of this work is shown by the fact that it was further amplified and annotated in i699 by another scholar, HUA SHIH-KO. 5. - Cicadas in painting i88. In painting the cicadas are just as popular as the crickets, the dragonflies, and the butterflies. Those who are interested in this field will find plenty of material to work with. In history, one of the best known cicadas was the one painted with a bird on a fan by Ku CHING-SU who lived during the fifth century. The fan was a gift from Emperor SHIAO WU of the Liu Sung dynasty (420-479) to Ho CHIH, the mayor of Wushing, who later presented it to the emperor of the Liang (502-557). It was said that the painting on this fan was greatly admired by Lu TIAN-WEI and Ku PAO-SHIAN, two of Ku CHING-SU'S contemporaries, who were also considered as masters in painting. 6. - Cicadas in love-making i89. What we have discussed so far may be considered more or less as belonging to the aesthetic field in its strictest sense. The present topic and the next two are somewhat different. Although there is still much beauty in them, the color of super- stition is rather strong. The love-maker was reported by Su SHIn to be found in south China and the popular belief still exists today among the rural folks. It represents a romantic superstition sprung evidently from an effort to save unsuccessful marriage. The following is the account: In Lingnan (south China) there is a kind of cicada called mao-tchen. These insects look like cicada. They have perfect wings and a knobbed hat on their head. They always live in pairs, with their heads toward each other, on the roots of mao (a kind of grass). They are collected during the third or the fourth month and can be easily recognized by the fact that the inside of their body always looks like wet powder. By carrying these insects, it is believed that an estranged couple would learn to love each other again.</page><page sequence="52">326 G. KAN-CHIH LIU I90. This account sounds as if these insects were in possession of some magic power. The native Chinese are probably impressed by the sexual attachment of these insects and believe that this attachment may be used to cure the antagonism between husband and wife. This is not a place to discuss the pros and cons of. the Chinese matrimonial system. But from the fact that similar stories are frequently found for other insects, one is inclined to believe that these superstitions rather tend to reflect the sad phase of marriage in China, where divorce is considered too serious for any respectable family. i9i. The love-maker in the present case, according to the brief description, appears to be a fulgorid and perhaps a Fulgora. No cicada is known to have a " knobbed hat." 7. - Cicadas as money-makers 192. The belief in the ability of cicadas to produce money is apparently world-wide. According to MARIAN, as quoted by MYERS in his Insect Singers (p. 34), such a belief was found among the farmers in certain parts of Macedonia where the rural folks thought that cicadas buried in the field would produce money in their place after a sufficient lapse of time. It is not known whether this ability applies to any cicada or to some particular kind. There was also such a belief in China but the Chinese belief appears to be quite refined and specific and arised apparently from a deep appreciation of some of the most remarkable habits of the insects concerned. 193. The Chinese money-makers are generally known under the name tsing-fu. They are figured in the Pentsao Kang Mu (FIG. 5) and reported by various writers to be found in Nanhai (south sea). It is not clear, however, whether this Nanhai is the District of Nanhai in Kwangtung or a fictitious locality. Furthermore, even with the figure and the description, it is not easy to formulate a clear idea of the systematic position of this insect. It appears to the present writer that different species are involved. I94. According to CHEN CHANG-CHI, who first introduced it into medicine as a sexual stimulant, the insect looks like cicada and lays its eggs on a tree (one writer stated that the eggs were</page><page sequence="53">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 327 laid on leaves). The account of YANG Fu, a writer from the Hang dynasty (206 B. C.-2iI A.D.), is more or less similar. In his Yi Wu Chi (Strange Things), he writes: " These insects are found in all mountains in Nanhai. They are golden-green and the two sexes always live together." YANG Fu called his insect teng-yu. But according to NAN KUNG-TSUNG, the insect appears to be subaquatic. In his Ko Lu Sun Su, this author writes: The insects are shining green and about the size of a mong (Tabanidae). They look like cicadas and live generally on the sweetflag. The eggs, similar to the eggs of the silkworm but rounded, are laid in spring on the leaves of this plant, and are arranged in rows of eight or nine. The insects are called pu-meng. According to KAN PAO, the author of Tziao Sun Chi (Looking for Wonders), the insects are as big as cicadas and even eatable. Evidently different authors referred to different species by the same name or attributed the same money-producing ability to different insects which happened to show the same sexual attach- ment or maternal instinct. 195. The Chinese belief seems to be inspired either by this maternal instinct or the sexual attachment observed among these insects. The version given by YANG Fu obviously belongs to the latter. This author makes no reference to the relation between the mother and its offspring but points out that the two sexes always live together. He asserts that if the coins are treated with the blood of these insects, they will come back at night after they were spent in day time. But this is the only case in which the sexual attachment is emphasized. For the rest, the mother instinct seems to be the chief concern. It is reported by various writers that the mother of this insect can locate her children and return to them no matter how far they have been separated and no matter how the separation has been carried out. Thus writes KAO SHIU in his Annotation of Huai Nan Wan Pi Su: The tsing-fu are also known as yu-fu or yu-peh. Put these insects in an urn with the mother and the children in equal numbers. Bury them near the wall on the east side of the house and leave them there for three days. Prepare two sets of coins with 8i in each. Then smear one set with the blood from the mother. Thus treated, if a person spends one set and keeps the other at home, the'set that was spent will come back to the owner again. I96. It is interesting to notice that the Chinese belief also requires subterranean treatment. Whether this similarity is merely a coincidence or indicates some relation between the</page><page sequence="54">328 G. KAN-CHIH LIU Chinese and the European belief is an open question. However, this is the only case where such treatment is defined as a part of the belief. The two versions given by KAN PAO and TUAN CHEN-SHIH respectively vary somewhat in detail but not in prin- ciple. According to that of the former, " If the coins be smeared with the blood from the mother, and the string for holding these coins, with that of the children, the coins will always come back to the owner again." But in the one given by TUAN CHEN-SHIH, the ability for the money to return is limited to those occasions when such money is spent on goods exclusive of gold, silver, pearls, and jewels. If the coins are spent on the latter, they will not return. It is plain that, in all these cases, the underlying idea is the strong maternal instinct of these insects. 197. This Chinese belief is an ancient one. It made its first appearance during the Han dynasty and has become so popular that even today the name of tsing-fu is still adopted as a synonym for cash or money. It is difficult to say whether there is any connection between the belief in China and that in Europe because, although the record for the latter appears very late (i900), with popular belief it is not easy to ascertain how long it may have existed. 8. - Cicadas and the cryptic leaf i98. Another popular belief, which made its first appearance during the Chin dynasty, is that in the cryptic leaf of the cicada. This is the tchen-yi, or cicada shelter. According to this beliet, cicadas are supposed to be in possession of some witchcraft, by virtue of which they can make themselves invisible. It is further believed that the leaves under which these insects have taken shelter will have the same magic power, and that, if a person carries such a leaf with him, he can hide himself from view as well. This belief was evidently originated from the frequent failure of finding these insects when their sound tells where they ought to be. It came down to us throug an anecdote about Ku KAI-TZE (392-467) as given in the Chin Su, or Annals of the Chin dynasty. I99. Ku KAI-TSE was a man who whole-heartedly believed in witchcraft. One day HUAN YUAN offered him a willow leaf and told hitn that it was the so-</page><page sequence="55">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 329 called tchen-yi. HUAN YUAN further asserted that if a person should hide himself behind this leaf, he would not be seen too. 200. Ku KAI-TSE was delighted. Later on he held the leaf in front of himself and tried to test its magic power on its donor. To his great surprise, HUAN YUAN performed a natural function right in his presence. He was thus convinced of the magic power of this tchen-yi. zoi. Ku KAI-TSE was famous for his three features, namely: painting, calligraphy, and stupidity. In these three points, he was said to have no equals in the world. We do not know about his painting and calligraphy. But from the story related above, his stupidity was certainly proved. Apparently he never suspected that he was fooled like a child. 9. - Cicadas in augury 202. Just as in Europe and America, cicadas also appear in the system of omens in China. Similarly too, the Chinese in- terpretation varies also with the occasion. It is said that, among the common people in New England, the appearance of a " locust " in a building is sometimes read as a sign of good luck and some- times as an omen of imminent death. 203. When Queen MENG, the inventor of the style of mengkia- tchen, painted the cicada on her robe, people took this action as a sign of bad luck. They thought that the queen was going to be dethroned because in this case the cicada was read as san which means abdication. But when a cicada happened to alight on his hat on the day of his promotion, CHU YI, an official in the Liang government, was congratulated by all his friends; for here the cicada was read to mean further promotion. In this case, the interpretation is perhaps based upon the custom prevalent then for the officials to wear a cicada on their hat. Both cases were said to turn out true. But it is abstruse to us why it should be misfortune in one case and good luck in another. io. - Cicadas in mythology 204. In Insect Singers, MYERS tells. us how cicadas figured in Chinese mythology (p. 23-25). The tongue amulets (FIG. I4), as used in the funerals, are a case in point. There is no doubt that this field will be also very fruitful. But the present writer</page><page sequence="56">330 G. KAN-CHIH LIU has not made any special attempt to explore along these lines. It appears to him that what is included here is more or less representative of the Chinese conception of this topic. 205. CHU YUAN was an official. His wife was suffering from mental derange- ment and became occasionally delirious. Instead of sympathizing with her and trying to help her to cure her suffering, he suspected that she had an affair. He spied on her and happened to notice one day that his wife, while weaving on the loom, was smiling toward a mulberry tree. He immediately looked in the same direction and saw a boy who, perching among the branches, was 14 or I years old and dressed in green with a green ribbon on his head. CHU YUAN became furious. He took his bow and shot at him. But the boy changed into a cicada about the size of a winnow fan and flew away. 2o6. This story is found in KAN PAO's Tziao Sun Chi and is also included in the Chinese Encyclopedia. It is probably the one referred to by MYERS as the legend of a lover. The following story is probably what MYERS refers to as the hsien of the Taoism: 207. YUAN CHAO, belonging to the sect of Huiling, was the chief priest of the Chin Tzih Temple. In his neighborhood there was a certain Mrs. CHANG who was suffering a recent bereavement of her daughter. One night Mrs. CHANG was told in her dream by her daughter that, on account of a sin she (the daughter) had commited in life, her soul was to become a snake. 208. At first Mrs. CHANG did not believe in her dream. But the next morning, when she saw a snake coiled under the casket of her daughter, she was horrified and deeply grieved. She decided to take the reptile and went to the temple. She told the priest about her dream and implored him to talk charm to the animal. YUAN CHAO did as requested and then told the woman to take the snake home and place it where she first found it. 209. Mrs. CHANG did as she was told. Later the snake disappeared but she saw a black cicada hovering over the coffin. She took a cage and talked to the insect, " If you are my beloved daughter, you may enter this cage and I will take you to the temple again." Strange to say, the insect entered the cage which she took to the priest. That same night Mrs. CHANG saw her daughter again and was told that her sin had been purged and the two forms of the snake and the cicada, which the soul formerly was destined to undergo, had already been passed through. 2io. The above story was found in the Chi Yueh Lu (Notes of Monk CHI YUEH). The conception of future life as embodied here is still common in China. It is generally known under the religious term, " lunhui" (wheel of life), and the kinds of animals, which a sinner is supposed to undergo, are not confined to the two just mentioned but depends upon the kind of sin which one had committed during life time. Any kind of animal is possible and even inanimate objects are also included. The most common one, however, is the dog. The conceptional connection of the</page><page sequence="57">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 331 woman with the snake tends to show that the above story is perhaps not of Chinese origin. 2II. In Buddhist conception, not only a person may change into a cicada but a cicada may also change into a human being. This is shown in the following story: One day Monk FAR KONG happened to see three cicadas caught by a boy. He felt compassion for these insects and decided to buy them in order to set them free again. Years later, as a result of a serious accident, the monk had his skull fractured. His life was in danger and no one seemed to be able to save him. Then suddenly a man came to him with some medicine and announced himself as a certain Mr. TAN. He said to the monk, " Remember, once you saved my life? It is my turn now to save yours. Please take this medicine." The monk did and his wound was immediately healed. 2I2. The idea in this story is also common in China and its application is not limited to insects. The main purpose seems to encourage kindness to animals under the assumption that all animals are grateful. The practice is sometimes carried to extremes by Buddhist, especially women, in the so-called fong-sen (set animals free), by which they would visit the market, buy the animals, and set them free again. i i. - The festival cicadas 2I3. In Sai Shih Tsa Chi (Miscellaneous Notes on Festival Customs), Nu YUAN-MING, a writer of the Sung dynasty, made the remark that on the middle of the first month, people in the capital were used to prepare yi-nan-tchen for celebration. He said that these yi-nan-tchen looked like moths but were bigger. But he did not explain what materials they were made from nor in what the celebration consisted. 214. The capital of the Sung dynasty was the city now called Kaifeng. The middle of the first month is still one of the great festivals in China and is celebrated in some sections of Honan, like Shiangchenshien, for instance, with lanterns and dough animals. The lanterns, made from bamboo, may take the form of all kinds of animals and so are the dough preparations; but, in general, only those which the Chinese consider as propitious are imitated. Yi-nan means good for son and the yi-nan-tchen were perhaps the dough cicadas the Chinese prepared on this occasion for those who were anxious to have children.</page><page sequence="58">332 G. KAN-CHIH LIU D. - DISCUSSION 2I5. On account of their almost universal distribution, cicadas as a group provide an excellent channel for a comparative anthropo- logical study of the different races of human beings on the globe. Keeping in mind what happened in Europe, the Chinese accounts of the cicadas become more interesting and more instructive. If one takes tettigology as a standard for comparison, one would find that the main course of the growth of the human mind is more or less the same in both cases. Before the Christian era, the intellectual outlook in China was more akin to that of the modern period. Many important works, notably the Classics, were produced then. But the next two thousand years showed entirely a different outlook and were characterized by scholasticism more than anything else. What is of particular interest is the fact that in Europe this change might be attributed to the influence of the church. But there was no church in China. Then what was responsible for this change ? 2i6. On the other hand, as pointed out frequently in the text, there are many points in common between the East and the West with regard to customs and superstitions relating to these insects. If there were only a few, they might be dismissed as accidental. But when they occur repeatedly, the situation be- comes tantalizing. Were these customs, superstitions, specul- ations, and so forth derived from a common source or did they arise independently? If they had a common origin, how can we account for their dissemination from one place to another when no records are known to show that there was any connection, or does it mean that there has been a connection between the East and the West long before there were any written records? The last assumption seems to be quite likely. If they arose independently, how shall we account for the fact that there are so many points in common? Is it possible that the human brain, qualitatively made of the same material, would produce the same response when it is subjected to the same stimulation - in this case, the cicada ? All these points are brought out here for those who may be more competent to discuss them. 2I7. This brings us to the end of our discussion of the cicada</page><page sequence="59">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 333 in its strict systematic sense. In the following pages only three more families of homopterous insects will be discussed, namely; the Fulgoridae, the Aphididae, and the Coccidae. These insects are not found in the Classics and hence their history, in the sense of written records, is comparatively short. However, the very fact that they are recent is of special historical interest in our study of the growth of the Chinese mind. II. - FULGORIDAE 2I8. So far as we can ascertain today, only two members of the family, Fulgoridae, are found in the Chinese literature. The mao-tchen, or love-maker, has been discussed in the last section. One is fairly certain that this moa-tchen is not a cicada because, in a modern taxonomic sense, no cicada is known to have a " knobbed hat," a character especially developed in the Fulgori- dae. The other member of this family is the crimson lady. The Chinese name of this insect has been given by AMYOT to a genus in the Cicadidae, namely Huechys. Nevertheless, as will be shown later, all the European literature on the Chinese medicinal cicada, H. sanguinea, refers to the crimson lady here. The crimson lady (Lycorma delicatula WHITE) 2i9. The crimson lady is a pretty and medium-sized fulgorid, one of those homopterous insects chiefly characterized by having the anal area of the hind wings reticulate. The insect is generally better known in Chinese literature under the classical name, huechy (Ailanthus fowl). But unfortunately, as just mentioned, this name has been borrowed by AMYOT and SERVILLE (I843) and given as a generic name to the cicada family. That huechy is what we know in science as L. delicatula, not H. sanguinea, is shown by both the figure and the description as they are given in the original Chinese text. To avoid any possible confusion with what has been long established in systematic work, especially when such change would not cause any serious objection on the Chinese side, it is deemed advisable to supersede the name huechy</page><page sequence="60">334 G. KAN-CHIH LIU with one which is the second oldest and which, in fact, is more descriptive, namely hung-liang-tse (crimson lady). It should be remembered, however, that AMYOT'S Huechys is really a misnomer. The hung-liang-tse is also known under the colloquial name, hui-hua-ao (grey variegated moth) or hua-da-gi (flowery lady). The last is the one commonly used in the southeastern section of Honan. 220. The insect appears to be of medicinal interest only. It was first mentioned in the Herbal where it was classified with the cicada as a drug of medium virtue. Since then it is found practically in most of the Chinese materia medica. Outside the medical world, however, it is generally neglected. 22I. It is perhaps due to this unpopularity that the insect has not been so abused as is the case with the cicada. There are no poems and no eulogies. But neither are there any superstitions, speculations, and misunderstandings. Its distribution, host plant, and life history are more or less carefully observed and recorded as they were without any anthropological complications. The figures (FIG. 8 and 9) are reproduced from the Cheng Lei Pentsao and the Pentsao Kang Mu. 222. The best description of this insect comes from the pen of Li SHIH-CHEN. Before him, it has been described by TAO HUNG-CHING, SU SUNG, and Ko TSUNG-PI, respectively. TAO HUNG-CHING's description is too brief. He states that the insect is found in Liangchow (Shiangchu, Honan) and looks like han-chiang but is smaller. Han-chiang, as mentioned before, is the name of a cicada. But if one does not know this insect, the reference is useless. He further states that the tree, hue, resembles the chi (Rhus vernicifera DC), but has a bad smell. But even with this additional information, the description is too brief to be of any practical use in identification. TAO HUNG- CHING, however, should receive the credit of being the first one to give us some idea of the insect and its host plant. 223. During the seventh century, SU SUNG gives us a fuller account by stating that there are two kinds of Iuechy, that the males are five-colored and are used in medicine, and that the females are blackish-green with white spots and are not used in medicine. This description is still too brief but it includes some positive attributes of the insects themselves. The remark</page><page sequence="61">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 335 about the sexual dimorphism, however, is rather misleading. According to specimens the present writer has on hand, there seem to be some local variations among these insects. But no superficial difference between the two sexes can be detected. 224. Furthermore, SU SUNG appears to have made another sweeping statement about the distribution. In the Herbal, these insects are said to be found in Holei. He considers this locality as wrong and states that they are found in Chichow. As we know today, these insects are rather common in central China and have been actually recorded from Peiping, Nanking, and Soochow; while the present writer has specimens from Taiyuan, Shansi, and Taiping, Anhwei. Both Chichow and Holei are in Honan and are known today as Nanchao and Shingyangshien respectively. Of course, sporadic absence from certain localities is possible. But in this case the denial is apt to be more wrong than right. 225. The record given by Ko TSUNG-PI during the twelfth century is much better than the two just mentioned. This physician in his Pentsao Yen Yi writes: These insects are very common in Kaifeng and Loyang. They look like the moth of silkworm, but with the abdomen much bigger. The head and the legs are slightly blackish. There are two pairs of wings; the outer pair is grey, the inner one deep red with all the five colors present. 226. This description is quite satisfactory and leaves no doubt what insect this author refers to. But this description is still not so complete as the one given by LI SHIH-CHEN during the sixteenth century. After explaining why this insect is called a fowl and pointing out that the hue is the ill-smelling Ailanthus, he continues: During the nymnphal stage, these insects have a depressed and truncated head, a pointed beak directed downward, three pairs of legs, and two pairs of wings. Later when they grow up, they can fly. The adults have two pairs of wings; the outer pair is greyish-yellow and speckled, and the inner one decorated with five colors. They generally arrange themselves in a row on the tree and in late fall deposit their eggs on the bark. 227. One may not agree with this author why the insect is called a fowl but one has to admit that this account is more than one can expect from such early times. With this description one can tell, even without the figure, that the insect is the fulgorid, L. delicatula, and certainly not the cicada, H. sanguinea. The reason why the insect is called a fowl, according to this author,</page><page sequence="62">336 G. KAN-CHIH LIU is because it sings on time as a rooster crows in the morning. This explanation is rather fanciful. It is called a fowl perhaps because it looks more or less like a bird. 228. This fulgorid has a fairly wide distribution in the Orient but its affinity seems to be essentially Palearctic. It is known to occur in Japan, Assam, and is reported from India by ATKINSON but in a doubtful locality. DISTANT believes that there is every probability that it will be found in the confine of British India. In China it is fairly abundant north of the Yangtze valley but the present writer did not have any representative from the south. 229. As mentioned before, this insect is of medical interest only. Outside medicine, the only case known to the present writer is the interest shown in them by children in Shiangcheng- shien, Honan, not far from Hankow. Here the children would place the insect on its back, put some coarse sand on its breast, and watch it turning the sand around with its legs. This acrobatic performance sometimes is turned also into a competitive game among the participants. 230. In medicine the insect appears to be well received. In the Herbal it is regarded somewhat as a sexual stimulant and recommended for impotence. Later it is mentioned as used for rheumatic pains, expulsing of clot, and as an agent for increasing blood circulation. TAO HUNG-CHING is the first one to warn that the insect should not be held too near the eyes, but without giving any reason. During the sixteenth century, the medical value is further extended to hydrophobia, lumps, scrofula, eye cataract, and sterility. In the Pentsao Kang Mu there are several detailed prescriptions. For illustration, we may take the one for hydro- phobia and the one for kidney poisoning. 23 I . For hydrophobia, the preparation consists of two crimson ladies, five pan-mao (Zonabris pustulata THOMS.), three green ladies (Lytta coraganae PALL.), half a seahorse, one fen of sue-sui-tse (Euphorbia lathyris L.), half a fen of frankincense, half fen jekon (Platycodon grandiflorum), half fen tsen-shiang (garoo-wood), and some linseed oil. The legs and the wings of all the insects should be removed. Put all these ingredients together and grind them into powder. Then give the preparation to the patient. The dosage and the amount of some of the insects</page><page sequence="63">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 337 vary with age. In general, the older a patient is, the heavier the dosage. 232. For kidney poisoning and intestinal extrusion, the prescription is much simpler. It is recommended to bake an egg which is wrapped in paper with six crimson ladies. Then remove the insects and take the egg with wine. It is said that as soon as thick blood appears in the urine, the illness is cured. 233. The insect is said to be mildly bitter and slightly poison- ous. It should be prepared by removing the legs and the wings and then baked with glutinous rice or flour until the color becomes yellow. According to TAO HUNG-CHING, the application of this insect in medicine was not very common in early times. But after the sixteenth century, it seems to become fairly popular. The underlying principle, according to LI SHIH-CHEN, is its ability to activate the circulation of blood. 234. The confusion of this insect with the medicinal cicada, in addition to the explanations given in the last section, may be due also to a remark made by Kou Pu in his annotation for the han in the Erh Yah. Concerning this classical term, he states that it is a small black insect with a red head and is called shiachy or huechy. It has never been settled what insect this han is but it was emphatically asserted by Su SUNG that it was not the crimson lady of the medical men. SU SUNG was the man who first intro- duced hung-liang-tse into literature. III. - APHIDIDAE 235. Insects included here are commonly called in English aphides or plant lice. Their history in China, in the sense of written records, is comparatively short. Before the tenth century, nothing was known about them. Since then, however, knowledge has been gradually extended until now seven species can be definitely recognized in Chinese literature. Comparing with what we know today, this number, of course, is small; for by 1937 about I20 species of this family have been reported from China and undoubtedly many more are waiting to be discovered. But, for the ancient Chinese, the fact that they knew seven of these tiny insects is more than we can expect. 22</page><page sequence="64">338 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 236. These aphides do not have any common Chinese name, either in colloquy or in literature. While in certain sections of Hupeh and Szechuan, they are known to the common people as tien-yen-tse (celestial swallow), and in the lower Yangtze as ya-tchang (tooth bug), in north China they are generally referred to as li-tchang (soft brug). These local names also occur in literature but with the difference that, under the same pronunciation, tien-yen-tse appears in the work of Li SHIH-CHEN as god-headache, and li-tchang in that of Li Su as clay bugs. In Kwangtung, they are sometimes even erroneously reported in newspaper as locust which are very rare in that region. 237. It is interesting to notice how these tiny insects happen to appear in Chinese literature. Just as the crimson lady, they have no place in the austere Classics and hence they are generally neglected by the literary class. The main ground from which they clamor for attention appears to be their economic importance. This is clearly shown by the fact that, among the seven species in literature, three were mentioned for their medical value, and the rest more or less for their connections with agriculture. This is perhaps one of the reasons why such remarkable phenomena as the parthenogenesis, discovered by CHARLES BONNET (I 720- I793) in I740, were unknown to the ancient Chinese. Being too much interested in their immediate concern, they nipped any further exploration at its very beginning. I. - The nut-gall aphis (Melaphis chinensis BELL) 238. Insect-galls are produced by galiflies which may belong to different orders, such as the Cynipidae (Hymenoptera), the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera), and the Aphididae (Homoptera). In Chinese literature several references are known to the present writer on such insects. But the only one, the species of which is certain, is the aphides or plant lice which produce the well known Chinese nut-galls of commerce. 239. The nut-galls are illustrated by Li SHIH-CHEN in his Pentsao Kang Mu and more recently by BAKER in the Entomological News (I9I7). It is the latter who proposes that the genus be</page><page sequence="65">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 339 changed from Schlechtendalia to Melaphis. In Chinese the insect is known as meng-tse. 240. Here perhaps a little historical digression may not be out of place That the galls are produced by insects seems to have taken a long time to clarify. In Europe this was not known until the seventeenth century when MARCELLO MALPIGHI (I628-I694) first made the discovery. In Japan it remained a mystery even as late as the nineteenth century. 241. in an important monographic paper on gall-producing aphides and their galls, by Prof. KOTA MONZEN, published in May, 1929, the statement is made that RANZAN ONO described a sumach gall in I8o2 stating that the gall was inhabited by small insects and was utilized by women to dye their teeth. 242. This quotation is a footnote (p. 339) inserted by L. 0. HOWARD in his History of Applied Entomology (I930). This sumach gall described under the Japanese name, mimibushi or fushi, is found to be due to the same insect that produces the Chinese nut-gall. HOWARD was apparently impressed by this discovery in Japan. But it must be admitted that from this footnote it is not certain whether this Japanese gentleman under- stood the deeper meaning of his observation as did the Italian scientist. 243. These European and Japanese discoveries, however, were long antedated in China. The following is the one given by Li SHIH-CHEN in his Pentsao Kang Mu (I578): 244. The wu-pai-tse (nut-galls) were formerly included in the same section with the grasses in the Kai Pao Pentsao (973). In the Chia Yu Pentsao (1057), they were transferred to the section for the trees. Evidently the author of the latter medical work was well aware that they were produced on the fu-meng without realizing, however, that they were produced by insects. The fu-meng (Rhus javanica L.) is the common yen-fu-tse. In early spring during the fifth or sixth month, there appear certain kinds of insects which are ant-like and live on this tree in the forest. They live by feeding on the sap and deposit their young (eggs?) on the leaves. These nymphal insects grow and develop little galls among the leaves just as the wax secretion of the la-tchang (Ericerus pela) and the puparium of the tsan-shih (Cnidocampa flavescens). The galls are at first very small but gradually increase both in size and firmness. They may be long or round and may be as big as a fist or as small as a water-chestnut (Trapa chinensis LoUR.) The color, at first yellowish-green, is somewhat yellow. The walls are solid and brittle and the inside, where the insects live, is hollow. These galls hang among the leaves as if they were born there. They are generally collected by the mountaineers before the frost and the insects are killed by steam- ing. Otherwise, the insects will emerge and the galls will be ruined because, after emergence, the walls will become thinner and putrid.</page><page sequence="66">340 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 245. ONO only remarked that the galls were inhabited by insects. MALPIGHI went further by asserting that the galls were produced by their inhabitants. The former perhaps would not have made his statement and the latter might have saved much of his patience, if both had known that there was such a complete account written long before them. Li SHIH-CHEN made another remarkable discovery, namely the specificity of the galls them- selves. He states that there are galls produced on other trees but, on account of the difference of the trees, such galls are not acceptable in medicine. 246. There is no question that Li SHIH-CHEN produced the best account of this nut-gall. But he cannot be credited as the first one to discover the relation between the galls and their inhabitants. In fact, he was in his turn long antedated by another scholar, Li FONG (925-996), who was one of the chief editors of the Tai Ping Yu Lan. In his Tai Ping Kwang Chi (Reminiscen- ces of a Peaceful Time), he writes: 247. From Chiashan to Szechuan, there is a kind of small and black insects called meng-tse. They can also bite but their bite is not poisonous. They are the insects which live inside a structure, called wu-pai-tse, on the underside of the leaves of the tree, yen-fu-shu. These wu-pai-tse, the nests of these insects, may be as big as a peach or plum and are generally utilized for the treatment of abscesses. They are collected and dried under the sun. Thu3 treated, the insects, which live inside, are killed and will not transform and emerge. Other- wise, they will change into meng-tse, make a hole through the wall, and escape. 248. This account of the wu-pai-tse leaves no doubt that the author had a clear idea of the relation between the galls and the insects. In fact, the main points of the statements as given by Li SHIH-CHEN resemble so closely those mentioned here by Li FONG that, but for his integrity as established elsewhere in his Pentsao Kang Mu, Li SHIH-CHEN may be well suspected of plagiarism. 249. In addition to these two accounts, there are some refer- ences to these nut-galls. MA CHI, a contemporary of Li FONG, also left the remark in the Kai Pao Pentsao that the galls were found everywhere, that they were green and sometimes as big as the fist of a man, and that the inside was inhabited by many insects. In this case, as with the Japanese record, it is not clear, however, whether the author understood the true relation between</page><page sequence="67">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 341 the galls and the insects. If he did, then the discovery made by Li SHIH-CHEN was even antedated in his own medical world. 250. These Chinese nut-galls were known to Europeans very early. According to LICHTENSTEIN (Stett. Ent. Zeit., I883, P. 240), they were introduced into Europe as early as I724. But this date is still not the earliest. The result of BAKER'S exhaustive research shows that these wu-pai-tse must have been known to Europeans long before this because the name, wu-pai-tse, is found in CLEYER'S Specimen Medicinae Sinicae which was dated i682. According to FLUCKIGER and HANBURY, these galls were employed chiefly in Germany for the manufacturing of tannic and gallic acid, which may be as high as 70 %. 25I. In China these galls are used both in medicine and in the tanning industry. In medicine, as shown in the Pentsao Kang Mu, there are as many as 71 prescriptions and the cases for which they are applied range from ordinary cold to abscess and dysentery. Sometimes the galls are powdered and allowed to ferment by mixing with yeast and strong tea. Then they are made into pills and are known as pei-yao-gien and it is in this form that they are generally used for black tanning. The insects themselves are recommended by LI SHIH-CHEN for curing the infection of the eyelids. 2.- The bamboo aphis (? Myzocallis arundicolens CLARKE) 252. Chronologically speaking, the chu-shieh (bamboo lice) were the next ones to appear in Chinese literature. They were first mentioned by SU SHIH (IO36-I ioi) in his Tung Po Chi Ling, where the author wrote: Anything which is motile is a fu-tse (son of Buddha). These bamboo lice, generally living in colonies, look at first like white powder which is smeared on the leaves of bamboo. These white spots later become motile and they are all the sons of Buddha. 253. SU SHIH was a poet and believed in Buddhism. His reference to these insects was made perhaps from a purely religious considerations and from his account alone, as seven species of aphides are already known to attack bamboo in China, it is not</page><page sequence="68">342 G. KAN-CHIH LIU possible to determine what species this is of bamboo louse. But his species is apparently the same as the one used in medicine and described by Li SHIH-CHEN as the following: 254. The chu-shieh are also called chu-fu-tse (son of Buddha) or tien-yen-tse (god headache). They generally live in colonies. At first they look like powdery spots on the leaves of bamboo but later become motile. They are as big as lice, dark grey in color, and are found not only on bamboo but on all kinds of grasses and trees. Some people believe that they are generated from humid and hot weather but others maintain that they are produced from eggs. 255. The last part of this account is of special interest. The author evidently had noticed more species of aphides than the bamboo lice. As we know today, although there are aphides, like the cotton aphis, which enjoy a large number of host plants, as a rule these insects are more or less quite specific in their diet. It is more likely that different plants are infested by different species than that one species of these lice invades different kinds of grasses and trees. Li SHIH-CHEN apparently regarded them all as one. 256. Li SHIH-CHEN himself seemed inclined to believe that these insects were generated from hot and humid weather because in his Pentsaoo Kang Mu these insects are placed in his section on insects of hua-sen (spontaneous generation). It may be pointed out that this opinion seems to be still the common one among the farmers in China. But Li SHIH-CHEN appeared to be also skeptical about his own conclusion because he immediately made the remark that they were also believed by others to be oviparous. On account of the complexity of the life and the form of these tiny insects, this confusion is quite excusable. 257. These bamboo lice were described by NAN KUNG-TSUNG as dark green. Although Li SHIH-CHEN defined his insects as dark grey, both probably referred to the same species. As a matter of fact, the insects of Li SHIH-CHEN ought to be the same as those of NAN KUNG-TSUNG because it was the latter who first reported the medical value of these insects. 258. It is difficult, however, to identify the insect even if one assumes that the insects of these two authors are the same. There is an illustration in the Pentsao Kang Mu but the illustration is very poor. In fact, one cannot even tell from it whether the insects are living on the upperside of the leaves or on the under- side. As mentioned before, seven species of aphis are already</page><page sequence="69">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 343 known to attack bamboo in China and it is possible that many more may still remain to be discovered by the systematist. At present, all one can do is to check the Chinese reports against the species already known. 259. NAN KUNG-TSUNG states that his insects are found all over the whole Yangtze valley from Chekiang to Szechuan. This wide distribution collaborating with the dark green color suggests that this bamboo louse of the Chinese physicians might be CLARKE'S M. arundicolens which was first described from California as " light lemon-yellow to dark yellow " and reported by ESsIG to live on the underside of the leaves. The present writer has not been able to consult the original description of Oregma minuta by VAN DER GOOT (Contrib. Faune Indes Nierlandaises, I, 3, 1917, P. 201) and that of Aphis bambusae by FULLAWAY (Ann. Report Hawaii Agr. Exp. Sta., 1909, P. 35). But it cannot be 0. cantonen- sis and 0. bambusicola because the former attacks the culm and the latter lives on the young shoots. Among the remaining three species known to occur in China, CLARKE'S species is the only one, the color and habit of which are approaching the description given by the Chinese. 26o. In medicine these bamboo lice are recommended for the treatment of paralysis. They are said to be poisonous. For hemiplegia, paralysis in which only one side of the body is affected, the treatment, as quoted by Li SHIH-CHEN from NAN KUNG- TSUNG, is as follows: 26i. Boil the shrubby horsetail and the ephedra until they become thick and paste-like. Spread this preparation on paper and apply it to the whole side of the body which is not affected by the stroke. Ears, eyes, nostrils, and mouth should be left untouched. Bake three chien (a unit of weight) of bamboo lice and grind them into powder. In case of an aged person, add one chien of musk. Swallow the drug with hot wine and then stay in bed. The effect of the medicine is quick. Soon bile water will come out from the mouth and the body will be covered with thick and ill-smelling sweat. Remove the paste from the body immediately and take a bath in horsetail decoction. Rest in bed for ten days and live on plain food. Thus treated, the ailment will be cured and the limbs will move again. 262. Whether the effect is due to the external treatment or to the bamboo lice taken in is a question which cannot be decided here. It might be due to both. What attracts one's attention is the fact that the ancient Chinese, although entirely ignorant of the function of the brain and the cause of the paralysis,</page><page sequence="70">344 G. KAN-CHIH LIU knew that the treatment for hemiplegia should be applied to the opposite side. 3.- The peach aphis (Myzus persicae SULZER) 263. The peach aphis is mentioned by CHOU MI (1232-1308) in his Kwei Shing Tsa Chi. Under the name of Ya-tchang, or tooth bugs, they are described as " small and black insects which are ant-like and live on the twigs." Judging by the color and the feeding habit, this peach aphis might be what we know in science as M. persicae which is known practically all over the world. 264. These aphides were mentioned in connection with the method of control. CHOU MI in his book just mentioned writes: These insects, as they occur on the twigs, are very difficult to remove even with the tung oil. But if an old bamboo lantern, the one generally hung on the wall, be suspended among the branches of the tree, these insects will drop down by themselves. Why should the insects react in this way is difficult to understand. This method is what Mr. TAI CHU-YU learned from the farmers. 265. The so-called bamboo lantern is perhaps the same kind which one may still find in some parts of China, especially in the inland. There is nothing strange about these lanterns. The framework is made from bamboo and the outside is covered with paper. But in order to make it water-proof, the paper coat is generally oiled. These lantern may be used for many years. Why should the aphis react to these ordinary contrivances is really abstruse except that the oiled paper may have something to do with it. This possibility is ruled out, however, when CHOU MI asserted that even tung oil proved ineffective. 4. - The bean aphis (Aphis rumicis MAKI) 266. This aphis and the next two are mentioned under the name of li-tchang (clay bugs) by Li Su in his Chien Wu (See Things) which was dated I582. The remark is very brief and consists of not more than two dozen words. But the knowledge of this author on aphides seems to surpass that of any other Chinese</page><page sequence="71">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 345 in history. He is the first one to recognize three kinds of these insects and also to record that they are at first nit-like but later provided with wings. He was a contemporary of LI SHIH-CHEN, the great Chinese physician, and his book appeared only a few years later than the Pentsao Kang Mu. But, in regard to the Aphididae, he was far superior to the physician. His interpreta- tion of ii as clay referred perhaps to the method of control as practiced by the farmers, which one may see today. This inter- pretation, however, is a mistake. Li should be soft. 267. His bean aphis, described as black, is probably what is known in science as A. rumicis, which is almost universal. It may be mentioned, however, that the color of this aphis, both the adult apterous and the winged female, is variable. It may be entirely black or range from reddish-brown to almost black. 5- The cabbage aphis (Brevicoryne brassicae LINN.) 268. LI Su stated that his green li-tchang live on grass but does not specify what kind of grass. The fact that the name of his aphids appears in his discussion on insects of the garden vegetables suggests that his green grass aphid might be the com- mon green cabbage aphis, or B. brassicae L. as it is known in science. 269. This destructive insect is also almost universal. It is found in India, Japan, Europe, and N. America. But strange to say, it is not included in Wu's catalogue of Chinese insects. This omission is probably due to the fact that, being too common, the presence of this insect is actually overlooked by the general collector. It is difficult to imagine that, being found in all the neighboring countries, it does not occur in Chinese territory. 6. - The tree aphis (? Neophyllaphis podocarpi TAKAHASHI) 270. The species of this tree aphis of LI Su and that of the next one of CHAO SHIAO-MING are difficult to ascertain. LI Su described his insect as " purple and white and are found on trees " but did not mention what tree. In this case, it is even difficult</page><page sequence="72">346 G. KAN-CHIH LIU to suggest what species his aphis might be. The color combin- ation, purple and white, will fit in more or less with N. podocarpi which lives on species of Podocarpus. This species was described from Japan by its author as " purple and slightly pulverulens." This description, however, only applies to the wingless female. Its present distribution includes Formosa, Foochow, Australia, and New Zealand. But whether the aphis of Li Su is this species is uncertain. 7. - The tao shi chu aphis 271. Chronologically speaking, this aphis is the last one to be found in Chinese literature. It is mentioned by CHAO SHIAO- MING for the treatment of abscess. But the author only states that it lives on the tao-shi-chu (peach silk bamboo). There is no positive attribute about the insect itself. 272. Tao-shi-chu is the name used in north China for what is called tao-chu (peach bamboo) in the Chun Fong Pu (I630), or Monograph of Plants. In this Monograph, the plant is described as having " leaves similar to the leaves of palm, and the trunk to that of bamboo but solid inside and with close internodes." The characterization is too brief to be of any use in identification. The plant is reported to be found in Szechuan and Honan. IV. - THE COCCIDAE 273. Among the homopterous insects, besides the Cicadidae, the Fulgoridae, and the Aphididae, references are found in Chinese literature also to the Cicadellidae and the Coccidae. The account of the former is sparse. The only species that appears in litera- ture is the one which lives on barley. This leaf-hopper is described under the name of fong-tu (square head) by Li Su in his See Things as green with a square head. He also reports that it jumps and flies. The term," square head," evidently refers to the truncation of the head in front. But, besides this barley hopper, nothing is known about this family. On the other hand, the literature on the Coccidae, although dealing with only two species, is fairly extensive.</page><page sequence="73">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 347 I.- The tse-kwang coccid 274. The tse-kwang, or purple mineral, is not the insect but its product. According to LI SHIH-CHEN, it looks like a piece of purple mineral which is red inside. It is used in dyeing, in medicine, and in the manufacture of cosmetics. In dyeing, it is employed as an artificial color for furs, jades, and jewels. In medicine, it is generally used as an antiseptic in surgery for wounds, abscesses, and other skin troubles. It is even recom- mended as a sexual drug. 275. This purple mineral made its first appearance in the Pentsao of the Tang dynasty, a medical book from the early part of the seventh century, where it was placed in the same section with the trees. In Pentsao Kang Mu, it was transferred to the section of viviparous insects and was illustrated with a figure (FIG. II). 276. It appears to the present writer that these tse-kwang may include the products of different coccids. The insects evidently occur only in warm regions. Most of the Chinese scholars knew only the product but not the insects themselves and their reports were all from hearsay only. As a consequence, the accounts we have today are conflicting among themselves. This situation existed already during the Tang dynasty. Thus TUAN CHEN-SHIH wrote in his U Yang Tsa Chou: 277. The tse-kwang tree grows in Java where it is called chin-chue. It also occurs in Persia. According to the account given by the Persian minister, the tree in his country is about ten feet high with myriads of branches and leaves which resemble the leaves of a citrous tree and do not fall in winter. The tree produces white flowers in the third month but does not bear fruits. The tse- kwang is produced when the branches and twigs are touched by fog, dew, or rain. But the account given for tse-kwang by the minister from Java is entirely different. According to this report, the tse-kwang is formed as a result of weathering from the ant-soil which is carried by the ants to the top of the tree to build their nest. 278. It appears to the present writer that this tse-kwang from Persia may be the commercial kermes which was universally used before the introduction of the cochineal (Dactylopius coccus) from America by the Spaniards. This kermes was formerly used as a dye by the Greeks, Arabians, and Persians for dyeing cloth blood red or crimson. It comes from the coccid, Kermes ilicis, which</page><page sequence="74">348 G. KAN-CHIH LIU is found in southern Europe, upon a small species of live oak (Quercus coccifera). 279. But the tse-kwang from Java cannot be the same as that from Persia because no kermes is known to be associated with ants, although it is now known that there are other coccids found in Java, which are found in ants' nests. Nor does it appear to be one of the ground pearls (Margarodes) which are associated with ants but known only to form cysts, the ground pearls, in the soil. 280. These tse-kwang seem to be quite popular with the Chinese physicians. Su KOoN, a physician from the seventh century, asserted that the tse-kwang was produced, like honey by- bees, by ants on the bark of trees and creepers by the seashore. SU SUNG, another physician from the eleventh century, made the remark that it was produced from the ant-soil in Kiachow (Annam) and was sent to the court annually as a tribute. 28i. It appears to be quite certain that tse-kwang is produced by some kind of coccids. This opinion is supported by the statement made by Ko TSUNG-PI and by Li SHIH-CHEN. The former stated that they were dark purple but red on crushing and look like sugar frost scattering all over the branches. Li SHIH-CHEN described them as " like the white wax produced by the pe-la insects, and are produced by tiny insects which look like ants or lice on the twigs." 282. The statement made by Liu SHUN is apparently wrong. This scholar lived during the Tang dynasty. In his Kwangchow Chi (Notes from Kwangchow) he writes: The tse-kwang is produced in the valley of Nanhai. It is the resinous secretion of a purple tree and is used for the manufacturing of cosmetics. The residue is used in the jade-carving industry. 283. Li SHIH-CHEN was probably right in considering the ant-lacquer of CHANG Pu as the tse-kwang of Java. CHANG PU lived during the Chin dynasty (265-420). In his Wu Lu (Notes from Wu), he gives us the following account: In the district of Yifeng, Kiucheng (Annam), there is a kind of clay which is red and resin-like. This clay usually indicates that there are ants living below. When this clay is discovered, the natives will clear the spot and plant a twig therein. Then the ants will climb up the twig and produce a kind of lacquer which looks like the egg-mass of the mantis. This is the ant-lacquer which is used for dyeing cloth deep red.</page><page sequence="75">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 349 284. It appears to be fairly certain that this ant-lacquer is the same as the tse-kwang. But what is the species of this coccid that produces this material, the present writer has not been able to ascertain. It does not seem to be likely that this coccid is still unknown to science, although the present writer did not find any clue in any of the standard works on ants or coccids he had consulted. It is hoped that those who are more competent may tell us the species of this interesting coccid. 2.- The white-wax coccid (Ericerus pela SIGNORET) 285. Of Chinese homopterous insects, besides the H. sanguinea and the Melaphis aphzis, a third species, also well known in European literature, is the Ericerus pela. This insect became known to European entomologists through the work of Du HALDE (I735). But since then there has been gradually built up a fairly large amount of literature, especially in French. Among the more important ones are the correspondance of JULIEN ( I840), the work of WESTWOOD (i853), and the Essay of SIGNORET (i874). In the first one, some of the Chinese accounts were translated into French and, in the latter two, the insect itself was subjected to careful study by these two eminent entomologists. There is also a large amount of literature in Chinese. But before going further it may be time now to correct some of the misunderstandings found in European writings. a) Phromnia pallida and Ericerus pela. 286. The first misunderstanding is that the white wax, or pela, of China is supposed to be produced, besides by E. pela, by another insect, P. pallida. This assumption is wrong. In I 893, KUNZE, in his Entomological Materia Medica, made the following statement: A small Chinese cicada, called Flata limbata, forms a sort of grease, adhering to the branches of trees, which hardens into a kind of wax. It is scraped off the trees, melted and purified, when it becomes white and glossy in appearance. Mixed with oil, it is made into candles. Chinese physicians also employed it in several diseases and used it as a preventive against palpitation and swoonings. (page 13). If this American physician stops here, one may suspect that his</page><page sequence="76">350 G. KAN-CHIH LIU Flata limbata might refer to the insect which is now known as E. pela. But on page i5 he continued: Coccus pela WESTWOOD is the species which furnishes the pela wax of China, found largely on Fraxinus chinensis and other trees of that country. The insect coats large surfaces of the branches with this substance, called in China, Shih- keue-ming, and collected for medicinal and other uses. This species of ash-tree is largely cultivated for the purpose of obtaining this wax in quantity, which is an important article of commerce. 287. It may be mentioned that the generic names of these two insects are replaced today by Phromnia and Ericerus respectively and the species limbata is now pallida. P. limbata was described by FABRICIUS (1794) as an Ethiopian species. In modern classifi- cation, it is regarded as one of the Fulgoridae and not a cicada. Before tracing the origin of this misunderstanding, we may as well point out another erroneous statement which was made by BURMEISTER and quoted by MELICHAR. It shows that even specialists of the highest rank are not always infallible. Under Flata pallida in his Monograph of Acanaloniidae and Flatidae (I90I-I902), MELICHAR writes : 288. Two specimens in the Hofmuseum are designated on a label as from East India. It is not certain whether this location is correct. The one given by FABRICIUS as America is corrected by BURMEISTER (i835) to China. According to the latter, the larvae of these insects are covered with white bristles (Flau) and live on Stillingia sebifera. They produce the Chinese wax, Tschang pe-la. The Chinese collect the wax from the leaves, melt it, and pour it into cold water where the wax coagulates into white lumps. The larvae are called tong-tcin. 289. Stillingia is now known as Sapium. Here, besides taking P. pallida as the insect which produces the white wax, BURMEISTER introduced two other mistakes, namely: the statement that the wax is collected from the leaves of the host plant and that the tong-tcin is the Chinese name for the larva. As will be shown later, tong-tcin is the Chinese name for the tree on which the pela insects live and not the name of the larvae of these insects. P. pallida is included in Wu's catalogue of Chinese insects. But it is still a question whether this fulgorid occurs in China. But even if it does, it may be stated that the Chinese wax is produced by the coccid, E. pela, and is not known to be produced by any other insect. 290. So far as the present writer is aware, DONOVAN seemed to be responsible for the spread of this misunderstanding. Of course he was innocent and the only mistake he made was to</page><page sequence="77">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 351 connect the white wax of China with the Flatidae. But by virtue of his authoritative position as an entomologist and the popularity of his Epitome of Insects of China (1798), the little mistake he made was greatly amplified. The following is his account on the white wax 291. This singular insect, and the plant on which it is represented, have equal claim to attention, both as object of natural curiosity, and importance in domestic economy. The larva is an elegant and beautiful creature, and China is indebted to its labor for the fine white wax so much esteemed in the East Indies. The plant is not less interesting, as it produces the vegetable tallow, in general use throughout the Chinese empire. 292. The novelty of these productions could not fail attracting the notice of those learned Europeans who were first allowed to reside in China, and whose object was to promote sciences and arts, as well as the Christian knowledge. Both the wax insects and the tallow-tree, are spoken of in their writings, as extraordinary and peculiar advantage to that country. Du HALDE, especially in his splendid work, L'Histoire de Chine, treats largely on these productions, in the section Cire blanches d'Insectes et l'Arbre qui porte le Suif. His relations are perhaps too prolix, but they are evidently the result of attentive observation and serve to illustrate the Natural History, and economical purpose, of the subjects we are noticing. They are briefly these: The white wax of China is called Tchang pe-la, it is not the same as the white wax of the bees, but is the produce of a sort of insects, forms a kind of white grease which attaches to the branches of the trees, hardens and becomes wax. It is scraped from the branches of the tree in autumn, melted on the fire, strained, then poured into cold water, where it coagulates and forms itself into cakes. This wax is very white and glossy, it is mixed with oil and made into candles, and is much superior to the wax of the bee for that purpose. 293. CHI TCHIN (Li SHIH CHEN), a Chinese writer, says, it was not till the Dynasty of YUAN that the wax made by these insects began to be known, the custom then became very general to employ it both in medicine and making candles. Its medicinal virtues are highly extolled by the Chinese physicians, and particularly by TCHI HEN (CHU TSENG-HENG). It is said to be a drug absolutely necessary to surgeons, that it makes the flesh close, stops bleeding, appeases pain, unites the nerves, rejoins the bones, and taken in pills, kills the worms that occasion consumption. It is found in most of the southeast provinces of China, but the best is brought from Se tchuen and Yunnan, and from the territories of Hen tcheou and Yung tcheou. 294. DONOVAN'S Epitome evidently was very popular. It was translated into German and published in Leipzig from i805 to i8ii. Later, in i842, it was re-edited by WESTWOOD with all the plates numbered and most of the names of the insects corrected. In WESTWOOD's edition, DONOVAN'S Cicada limbata was changed to Flata nigricornis. 295. From the above quotation, it is plain that to DONOVAN, so far as the Chinese wax is concerned, there is no E. pela, but</page><page sequence="78">352 G. KAN-CHIH LIU the cicada limbata, which opinion was accepted by KUNZE' and perhaps many others. The mistake made by BURMEISTER in taking the Croton or tallow-tree as the natural food of P. pallida and tong-tcin as the name of the larva is evidently due to confusion or a bold assumption. DONOVAN made a special remark that " the tallow-tree is not the natural food of the wax insects but as they mutually illustrate the same inquiry, they are represented in the same plate." This remark was apparently overlooked by BURMEISTER or misinterpreted. 296. There is another mistake in DONOVAN'S statement, which will be discussed later. KUNZEI also contributed a mistake of his own. He stated that Shih-keue-ming was the secretion of the wax insects. As we know, Shih-keue-ming is one of the Mollusca, known in science as Haliotes, and has nothing to do with the white wax. b) An historical correction. 297. As shown in DONOVAN'S account, it was Li SHIH-CHEN (CHI TCHIN) who first made the statement in his Pentsao Kang Mu that the white wax was not known till the Yuan dynasty. This opinion was maintained and further strengthened by Hsu KWANG- CHI (I562-i633) who was the author of the famous Nung Cheng Chuan Shu (i639), or General Agriculture. Concerning the white wax, he writes: 298. Concerning the culture of the white wax insects on the tong-tcin tree, so far as I know, there was hardly any record before our dynasty (Ming I368- i644). Today the pela-culture is a common industry in all the south-eastern provinces. At first I was rather skeptical and thought that this lack of written records should not be taken to mean that there was no such industry in ancient times. It may mean that the ancient scholars, when they wrote their books, had no time to make an exhaustive research into all the documents. Hence we have no records today. 299. However, now my opinion has changed. According to the information I have, the history of the pela-culture in Wuchow (Kinhua, Chekiang) is not more than twenty years old and that in Wushing only about ten years. In my native town (Shanghai) it is even shorter. It was in i6io, only five years ago, in which I first planted a few hundred of the tong-tcin trees in the graveyard of my ancestors. Now many farmers have taken up the cultivation. The insects may be indigenous or imported from Wushing, and, according to the opinion of the farmers, the former are much better than the latter. From these facts, it appears that the white wax industry is an innovation and was not known to the ancient people. 300. It is probably true that, before the thirteenth century,</page><page sequence="79">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 353 this white wax was not used in making candles and that its utiliz- ation was not so general as it was during the Ming dynasty. But it is certainly wrong to assume that the culture of these insects was not known to the Chinese before the time of these two Chinese writers. As a matter of fact, according to the records we know today, the industry was known as early as the fifth century, a thousand years earlier. Thus one finds in Shu Yi Chi (Accounts of Wonders), a book by JEN FONG (460-508), the following statement: 301. CHANG Kwu was a poor but kind and honest man who lived in the region of Tscho (Hunan and Hupeh). One day an old man came to his house. CHANG Kiu was very hospitable to him and offered him all he had. As a token of appre- ciation, the old man, on departing, gave him some la-woong (seeds of wax insects), explaining to him the method of cultivation, and told him that they would bring him some profit to relieve his poverty. 302. CHANG Kiu followed his instructions. But for three years he did not suc- ceed. One day the old man came back again. He was surprised to find that his for- mer host was still as poor as he left him and, on learning his failure, asked CHANG Kiu to show him the woodlot. CHANG Kiu did. The next morning all the trees were coverd with pei-hua (white flower). Then the old man said, " These seeds and the method to raise them should be made known to the world at large and to be shared with those who are kind and honest." After this exhortation, he suddenly disappeared. 303. As it is the case with most of the ancient writings, such accounts are generally cloaked with mystery. But in this account, the mystery does not conceal the fact that the wax insects were already known during the Liang dynasty (502-557). It may be pointed out that the scale-agglomeration on the branches of the tree is technically still known as " hua." LI SHIH-CHEN was a native of Tscho and it is interesting that this earliest record of the wax insect should come from people of his region. The same curious coincidence happens to Hsu KWANG-CHI. In his Kwei Shing Tsa Chi, CHOU MI (I232-IP38) writes : 304. Formerly there was no pela-culture in Chekiang. About ten years ago, an old Taoist brought some seeds of these insects from Huainan (south of the Huai River) and tried to sell them there. The seeds look like the small seeds of the ch'ien (Euryale ferox SALISB.) and are sold by the sheng (about a pint). The leaves of the tree, on which the insects live, resemble the leaves of the chu-yu (Cornus officinalis S.Z.) and the trees can be propagated by cuttings. They grow near water and can be utilized at the end of the third year. These trees can be also obtained from seeds but the seeds must be first raised in pots. 305. Before meng-tsung (June 6), the seeds of the insects, about a dozen in a small bag, are suspended among the branches. By the fifth month, each of these 23</page><page sequence="80">354 G. KAN-CHIH LIU seeds will give rise to myriads of insects which are as tiny as midges. They deposit their white faeces on the twigs and then disappear. The white faeces are the white wax which is&amp; scraped from the twigs by the early part of the eighth month and, after being boiled, change into wax. 306. These insects leave their seeds on the branches. These seeds are at first very small but grow bigger by the next spring. By the second or the third month, they are collected and distributed as before. The industry is as profitable as sericulture. It is said that the tree, tong-tcin, can be also used as a food plant for the insects. 307. Hsu KWANG-CHI maintained that the pela-culture in Chekiang was started within his life-time. But from the above quotation, it is plain that his statement was wrong. Historically speaking, CHOU MI's record is especially interesting. One learns, for instance, that the tree tong-tcin was not the original food plant, that the secretion of the insect was regarded as faeces, and that the seeds formerly were produced locally and not imported from other districts. c) The biology of the wax insects. 308. The wax insect is the only species of the genus and belongs to a large subfamily, Lecaniinae, or tortoise scales, of the family, Coccidae. It is indigenous to China. The larva is oval and yellowish-brown, with long beak. The antennae consist of six segments with the last one the longest. The tarsi are as long as the tibiae. The adult female is spherical, globulose, and possesses an indentation by which it attaches itself to the branch. The adult male (FIG. i5) is remarkable for its large size, with long and transparent wings and long and slender tails. It is tawny with the thorax as long as, but broader than, the abdomen. The head is provided with six ocelli and four facetted eyes. The legs and antennae are long and pubescent and each of the two halters on the thorax has two bristles at the tip. The most remark- able point of this wax insect is that, instead of the female, the male is the one that produces the wax. 309. Morphologically speaking, very little references on these insects could be found in Chinese literature. True, the insect and its host-plant are figured in the Pentsao Kang Mu but the illustration is very poor. The account given in the last paragraph is the result of modern study. But the habits of these insects seem to be fairly well known to the early Chinese. Thus Li SHIH-CHEN writes:</page><page sequence="81">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 355 3io. The wax insects are about the size of lice. After ment-tsung, they spread over the branches, feed on the sap, and excrete a sort of saliva which is attached to the twigs, changes into white grease, and finally condenses into wax, like frost. 3'i. The insects are at first white but become reddish black when they produce wax. The scales they form on the branch are at first about the size of a grain, but after spring, grow as big as the chi-tu-chi (Euryaleferox). These scales, purplish-red in color, are the houses, like the egg-mass of the mantis, built by the insects to deposit their eggs. They are the so-called la-tchang or la-tse (seeds of wax insects) and are full of hundreds of white eggs which look like tiny lice. They are collected next year on li-shia (May 6), wrapped up with bamboo leaves, and suspended among the branches. After meng-tsung, the eggs will hatch, the insects come out from the wrap, climb first to the underside of the leaves, and then ascend the twigs to produce the wax again. 312. Li SHIH-CHEN may be regarded as the first one to make a careful observation on the habits of these insects. But his opinion, in taking the wax secretion for a kind of saliva, was not accepted by others. In fact, no Chinese seem to have a clear idea what this secretion is. As mentioned before, it was considered by CHOU Mi as faeces. This opinion was shared by Li Su and most probably by the common people as a whole. But this fecal theory was denounced by WANG CHI, who, it may be pointed out, was generally considered as the first one to introduce the wax into medicine in his Pentsao Lei Pien. The following account is the one given by this physician: 313. The wax produced by the pela insect is different from the wax produced by the honey bee. The pela insect feeds on the sap of tong tcin and later changes into white grease which adheres to the branch. This white wax is not the feces of the insect, as assumed by the common people. 314. WANG CHI recognized that the wax was produced by the insect and pointed out that it was not its faeces. But he did not explain how the wax was produced. On this point he was followed by Hsu KWANG-CHI who states: As the warm weather approaches, the insects gradually come out from their cradles. They wander at first up and down the trunk of the tree and, if there ares grasses near the tree, they will migrate to the grasses without returning to the tree again. Hence the neighborhood of the tree must be kept clean. After this wandering, they will go to the underside of the leaves and stay there for a few days. Then they come out to the twigs where they thrust their beaks beneath the bark, suck the sap, and produce the hua (flower). 315. Here it may be pointed out that the observation made by this agriculturist more or less confirms the one made by the physician, Li SHIH-CHEN, about a century earlier. But there are several points of important difference. Li SHIH-CHEN also made</page><page sequence="82">356 G. KAN-CHIH LIU the remark that the neighborhood of the tree should be kept clean but the reason he gave was the presence of ants which might attack the wax insects. On the other hand, Hsu KWANG-CHI was perhaps the only one to discover that the sucking was done by piercing through the bark. 3 i6. Hsu KWANG-CHI also left some notes on the physiology of the wax insects. There was a popular belief that, if the tree produces wax, it could not produce the scales that are going to be used as seeds for the next season and vice versa. Hsu KWANG-CHI asserted that this assumption is not true. According to him, both the wax and the seed-scales can be produced at the same time. He also made the remark that, during the vigorous growth of the scale-insects, there appeared a kind of waxy material which looked like honey, and that, if this waxy material were removed, the insects would dry up. There is no doubt that Hsu KWANG-CHI, as an agriculturist, knew more about the life of this wax insect than Li SHIH-CHEN, the physician. 317. Besides these records on the habit and the physiology of the wax insect, no one seems to have paid any attention to the sex of this coccid. As mentioned before, one of the most peculiar characteristics of this E. pela is the fact that, while in most other coccids, the male is active and the female sessile, the opposite is true in this species. In this insect, the female is more or less free while the male is sessile and produces the wax. This fact perhaps has never occurred to the ancient Chinese. True, this insect is placed by Li SHIH-CHEN among his lan-sen (oviparous insects) but it is not clear how much he understood by this term. 3i8. On the whole, it may be safe to say that the insect re- mained more or less a mystery to the ancient Chinese. This is clearly shown in a statement made by CHANG TSUNG-FA as given below: 319. Small insects are generally believed to be generated from humidity. Some one asks me to what class should the wax insect belong? I cannot answer this question. According to Huai Nan Tse, there are animals which butt with their horns, or bite with their teeth, or sting with their poisons, or kick with their hoofs. They play when they are happy and they fight when they are angry. But the wax insect does not have any emotion. According to Chou Li, small insects may be grouped according to the way of their sound-production, the position of their skeleton, or the way of their movement. Under the first criterion, insects are divided into those producing sound from the mouth (?), from th? flanks, from the wings, or from the legs. But the wax insect does not produce</page><page sequence="83">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 357 any sound. Under the second criterion, insects are classified by having either an exo-skeleton or an endo-skeleton. But the wax insect does not have any bones. Under the third criterion, insects may be arranged into such that move backward, sidewise, continuously forward, or by wriggling. But the wax insect does not move. In short, one cannot understand the mystery of creation and this wax insect may be regarded as an insect of wonder. 320. To one who is baptized with modern scientific spirit, this loss in finding facts not agreeing with authority can be easily recovered by studying the facts themselves and discarding the authority. But this courage is not to be expected from those who were brought up under the influence of scholasticism. The pitiful puzzling of this author may be regarded as representative of the general mental atmosphere of the Chinese, especially during the last thousand years. Furthermore, there are many cases on record where the insects suddenly appear by themselves on trees where they were not suspected. Such occurrence, to the simple-minded people, must be always a mystery. 321. The distribution of this wax insect was fairly well under- stood by the ancient Chinese. Li SHIH-CHEN reports that it is found in Szechuan, Yunnan, Fukien, Kwangtung, and the south- eastern section of Kiangsu and Chekiang. This report is supported by later records made by various writers, both Chinese and Eu- ropean. Hsu KWANG-CHI has a long list of detailed locality in his Nung Cheng Chuan Shu. It is interesting to notice that, in Wu's Catalogue of Chinese Insects (I935), only Honan, Nanking, Chinan, and Mokanshan are given. These localities are evidently based upon reports from modern scholars. d) The host plants of the wax insects. 322. Concerning the host plants of the wax insects, Hsu KWANG-CHI made the following statement: These (six) are the food plants I know. But I think there may be many more. Take the food plants of the silkworm for instance. Ordinarily these insects are known to feed on the mulberry and the Cudrania only. But in Tunglai (in Shantung), where the mountain cocoons are produced, they feed on any tree except the yang (Salix gracilistyla MIQ.) Of course, the quality of the silk is not the same. Among all the food plants, it is found that the silk from worms which feed on the mulberry and the Cudrania is not so good as the silk from those which feed on the chiao (Zanthoxylum piperitum DC), while the silk from those which feed on the chun (Cedrela chinensis Jus.) or the hue (Ailanthus altissima SWINGLE) is the worst. But it is plain that there are many things we do not know and still remain to be discovered. It is foolish to limit to what we see only.</page><page sequence="84">358 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 323. The main theme of this agriculturist is to show that there may be many more plants, which may be used as food for the pela insect, than the six he had listed. His opinion might be correct. But there seems to be much confusion in literature, both Chinese and European, on the food plant of this wax insect. In recent publications, it is generally reported that the insect feeds on species of Rhus, Hibiscus, Ligustrum, and Fraxinus. But it should be remembered that the modern reports are usually based upon those earlier documents which do not always come from reliable authority. There is probably no question about Ligustrum and Fraxinus being used as the food plant. But the same should be stated with reservation for Hibiscus and Rhus until some competent scientists have made their reports. 324. The list of BLANCHARD, as shown below, is a hopeless medley of Chinese and Latinized terms. This French gentleman reports that the food plants of the wax insects include i. Tong-tcin (Ligustrum glabrum). 2. Niu-tching (Rhus succedanus). 3. Shoui-tong-tcin (a variety of tong-tcin). 4. Shoui-kin (Hibiscus syriacus). 5. Tcha-la. 6. Kan-la-shou. 7. Shoui-la-shou. 8. Ligustrum lucidum. 9. Celastrus ceriferus. i o. Fraxinus sinensis. 325. It is difficult to check this list because it is compiled from various sources not of equal reliability. But it is fairly certain that the same plant may be repeated under different names. This can be inferred from the confusion which already exists in the original Chinese literature. There seem to be only six kinds of trees reported as food plants for this wax insect. Tong- tcin, niu-tching, shoui-la-shou, and tien-tsu-tse (Quercus myrsinae- folia BL.) are the ones first listed by Li SHIH-CHEN. The last one did not appear in any European report. Shou-kin was mentioned in the Sung Shih Tsa Pu, a book quoted by Hsu KWANG-CHI but the author of which the present writer has not been able to ascertain. Tcha-la was introduced by Hsu KWANG-CHI. The confusion begins when Hsu KWANG-CHI tries to explain that the</page><page sequence="85">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 359 niu-tching of Li SHIH-CHEN is the tong-tcin of the Wu region and that the tree called shoui-tong-tcin or shih-yeh-tong-tcin in the region of Wu, is the tong-tcin of Li SHIH-CHEN. He further states that the shoui-la-shou of Li SHIH-CHEN is a synonym of shoui-kin of the Sung Shih Tsa Pu. If the opinion of this Chinese agriculturist is correct, then the shoui-la-shou and the shoui-tong-tcin have to be dropped from BLANCHARD'S list. 326. There is no use to dwell any longer on this verbal dis- cussion. For the time being, it is perhaps more advisable to see what one of the best dendrologists in China has to say on this subject. Dr. W. Y. CHUN, another Chinese from Harvard, writes in his Chinese Economic Trees (192I): Insect white wax is produced on Fraxinus chinensis and F. mariesii. The insect, Coccus pela, is bred on the Ligustrum lucidum and other species of privets. According to his opinion, F. chinensis is the pela-shu (p. 279) and L. lucidum, the tong-tcin (p. 285 tung-ching). Unfortunately he does not include the Chinese names for his F. mariesii, L. ibot, L. sinense, and L. amurense. The last three are said to be " some of the most common shrubby privets in China." Dr. CHUN also makes the remark that F. chinensis is very variable as regards the shape and serration of the leaves and that five varieties of this species have been recognized. In view of these statements, it appears that most of the plants, mentioned in the old Chinese literature as food plants for the wax insects, may belong to either of the two genera, Fraxinus and Ligustrum. The problem, how- ever, cannot be so easily settled unless all the old Chinese names for the food plants of this insect are carefully checked by the cooperation of competent entomologists and dendrologists. e) The white wax. 327. The white wax, which one often sees in the store of an apothecary in Szechuan, is sold in the form of a large lump which is somewhat bowl-shaped, about half a foot in diameter, and about two inches thick. It is perfectly white, shining, tasteless, odorless, and not greasy in touch. The general appearance somewhat resembles that of spermaceti, or the waxy substance found in the head of the sperm whale, but it is more brittle and of a more fibrous texture. It is harder than the honey-bee wax, insoluble in water, hardly attacked by alcohol, acids, and bases,</page><page sequence="86">360 G. KAN-CHIH LIU but dissolves in essential oils. According to SILLIMAN, it melts at I i80 F. (47.70 C.). But the melting point has not been definitely settled; some report it as 380 C., others place it at 840 C. 328. Chemically speaking, the wax has a definite composition with the formula C52H1O402 and is known as cerotate of ceryl. It does not completely saponify by boiling in potash water but does completely decompose when melted with potash. One of the Chinese physicians, WANG CHI, asserts that it is different from the honey-bee wax. But, according to SILLIMAN, the physical and chemical properties of the wax of these two insects are more or less analogous. 329. In China this insect wax is used in medicine, in candle industry, and occasionally also in jade industry. Recently some Chinese histologists even attempt to employ it in place of paraffin. But in France, Japan, and Annam, where this wax is still in demand, it is used for making toys and cosmetics. 330. In the candle industry, it is said to be much preferred to other materials because, on account of its high melting point, it does not melt so easily when the candle is lighted. According to Hsu KWANG-CHI, candles containing even one percent of this wax will stand the heat of burning much better. It is probably due to this firmness that the pela-candle is generally preferred in sacrificial ceremonies. 33i. In medicine its usage was not known until the later part of the Yuan dynasty. It was first mentioned by CHU TSENG- HENG (128i-I358) but was not formally introduced into medical writings until WANG CHI during the Ming dynasty. According to the former, it can be used for stopping bleeding, appeasing pains, repairing broken bones and tendons, and stimulating the growth of muscles. Later it was pointed out by Li SHIH-CHEN that it was used for coating pills and for killing the worms of the chee, or consumption. It is even said to be able to stimulate the growth of hairs again after the head has become bald as a result of some scabby infection. But, in the main, it is used chiefly in surgery. 332. There are two theories for its function in surgical treat- ment. One proposed by CHU TSENG-HENG emphasizes its contracting property. According to this theory, it is regarded as of the nature of a metal with great contracting ability and hence forms an important article in surgery. The other theory is</page><page sequence="87">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 361 advanced by LI SHIH-CHEN who reasons from the fact that the tree on which the insects feed, namely tong-tcin, is known to be effective for healing wounds and swellings and he deduces that the wax produced therefrom ought to have the same property. In this case, LI SHIH-CHEN'S conception is quite modern. f) The pela-culture. 333. Concerning pela-culture, the best account in a European language, so far as the present writer is aware, is the one given by COOPER in his Travels of a Pioneer of Commerce (i871). For those who may not have easy access to this interesting book, it is reproduced here in full. 334. On the third day we entered the white wax country, so named from its producing the famous white wax of Szechuan, which has been erroneously called vegetable wax. This district was less undulating than that of the tea gardens, and presented to the eye a view of extensive plains surrounded by low hills. The plains were all under wax and rice cultivation; the wax trees being planted round the embankments of the small paddy fields which were at most thirty yards square. The country thus presents to the passing traveller the appearance of extensive grooves of tree stumps each as thick as a man's thigh and all uniformly cut down to a height of about eight feet, without a single branch. 335. The cultivation of wax is a source of great wealth to the province of Szechuan, and ranks in importance only to that of silk. Its production is not atten- ded with much labor or risk to the cultivator. The eggs of the insects which produce the wax are generally imported from the districts of Ho-chin or Ho- king, and Why-li-tzow, in Yunnan (where the culture of eggs forms a special occupation) by merchants who deal in nothing else but pe-la-tan, " white-wax eggs." The egg-clusters, which were described to me as about the size of a pea, are transported carefully packed in baskets of the leaves of the pelashu, " white-wax tree," which resembles a privet shrub; and arrive in Szechuan in March, where they are pur- chased at about twenty taels per basket. The trees by the middle of March have thrown out a number of long, tender shoots and leaves, and then the clusters of eggs, enclosed in the wvall of the young leaves, are suspended to the shoots by string. About the end of the month the larvae make their appearance, feed on the branches and leaves, and soon attain the size of a small caterpillar, or that of a wingless housefly, apparently covered with white down, and with a delicate plum-like appendage, curving from the tail over the back. So numerous are they, that, as seen by me in Yunnan, the branches of the trees are whitened by them, and appear as if covered with feathery snow. The grub proceeds in July to take the chrysalis form, burying itself in a white wax secretion, just as a silkworm wraps itself in its cocoon of silk. All the branches of the trees are thus completely coated with wax an inch thick, and in the beginning of August are lopped off to the close trunk and cut into small lengths which are tied up in bundles and taken to the boiling house, where they are transferred, without further preparation, to large cauldrons of water, and boiled until every particle of the waxy substance rises to the surface; the wax is then skimmed off and run into moulds, in which shape it is exported to all parts of the empire.</page><page sequence="88">362 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 336. It would seem that the wax-growers find that it does not pay them to reserve any of the insects for their reproductive state, and hence the necessity of importing the eggs from Yunnan. 337. Today Szechuan is still the center of the production of this white wax. COOPER'S account gives one some general idea about the part this culture plays in the economy of the native Chinese. In Kuanshien, Szechuan, which the present writer visited in 1932, for miles one will find that the embankments of the paddy fields are surrounded with the white-wax trees which make the whole district look almost like a park. The trees here, however, are not in stumps as described by COOPER. 338. The chief advantage of pela-culture, as pointed out by COOPER, lies in its safety. "It is not attended with much labor and risk to the cultivator." As early as the thirteenth century, it was pointed out by CHOU MI to be as profitable as sericulture. At present there is no way to make an estimate about the total production for the whole country. According to the Chinese Custom Report for 1934, the total amount exported is about 3,000 piculs with a value about 300,000 silver dollars. But this amount also includes the wax from the honey bee. Moreover, this custom report leaves out the large amount retained for home consumption. 339. There are some old data, in European literature, on the price of this wax. The total industry in Szechuan, according to RECLUSE (I882), was estimated by RICHTHOFEN to be about fourteen million francs. EUG. SIMON, the French consul in China, reports that by I863 the wax costs about 200-250 francs for 6o kilograms; a little later, it is sold at the place of production in Szechuan, Honan, and Shansi, about 140-150 francs but on account of transportation, the price in Shanghai, is almost doubled. MACGOWAN writes in i850 that it costs about I.50 to I.75 francs per pound. According to the estimate of a Japanese anthor, SASSAKI, the total production of this wax in China is about 200,ooo dollars. No one seems to have made any estimate how much wax an ordinary tree will produce under normal conditions. 340. Now when one comes to the cultivation of the insect and the wax itself, one finds that the process, although quite simple, offers many interesting problems. The whole procedure</page><page sequence="89">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 363 may be divided into three steps or stages, namely: propagating, harvesting, and extracting. In some cases, the first stage may be omitted, for the coccids may suddenly appear by themselves. But this natural propagation cannot be depended upon because, without human interference, the food plant, as a consequence of continuous drain on its vitality, will eventually perish. 341. Among the three stages, the work involved in the last two is comparatively simple. Harvesting means the collection of the scales from the tree. It is generally done in fall or after the chufen (September 23). However, it depends more or less on the condition of the scales on the tree. If it is done too early, the scales will be premature and will not bear much wax. On the other hand, if it is done too late, the scales will. be so hardened that it will be difficult to remove them from their attachment. The approximate date, as given by Li SHIH-CHEN, is between the chufen and the peilu (September 8). 342. There are two ways of collecting the scales from the tree; one is to collect them with the twigs which are lopped off the trunk, as described by COOPER, and the other is to remove them from the tree without cutting the twigs. After a rain or early in the morning while the dew is still on, the scales can be easily removed from the twigs. Otherwise, they have to be moistened with water first before they can be scraped off. At this stage, the scales are called la-tsa, or raw wax. 343. The operation of extraction is also more or less simple. The fundamental principle is to separate the wax from ingredients of the scales by melting. But there are a few variations in detail. According to Hsu KWANG-CHI, the scales are melted in boiling water. The wax will float to the surface where it can be skimmed off. This process is repeated until no more wax is left. The wax while still warm is poured into a sort of a loop-mould in which it forms the typical lump after cooling and can be easily pulled up by means of a cord. This method is essentially the same as the one described by COOPER. 344. The method mentioned by CHANG TSUNG-FA is some- what different. According to this method, the scales are melted as before, but, instead of waiting for the wax to come up to the surface, the melted material is transferred to a strainer, a piece of cloth, where the wax is allowed to drip into another vessel</page><page sequence="90">364 G. KAN-CHIH LIU where the water is kept boiling. A third method, mentioned in the Sung Shih Tsa Pu, differs even more from others. It may be called steaming. According to this method, the scales are first dried in the sun and then placed on a piece of cloth over the mouth of a large urn which contains water. A receptacle is placed in the urn. After the water is heated, the wax will melt and drip into the receptacle. 345. The work involved in propagation is more complicated; the scale-seeds may have to be brought in from a distant country and the amount of insects to be distributed on each tree has to be determined by the condition of the tree concerned. Both factors present many practical problems and need sound judgment. 346. Where the scale-seeds can be produced locally, the operation usually starts in May. The twigs with the scales are cut off from the tree, chopped into small sections, each bearing some scales; the scales are soaked and loosened, removed from the twigs, placed in lots of three or four, (six or seven in each lot for the smaller ones), and then wrapped up in bamboo leaves. Each lot forms a bundle by itself. These are stored in a clean vessel. It is said that, if the weather is rainy, they can be kept for several days. Otherwise, the insect will hatch and should be transferred to the tree as soon as possible. This is in general the practice in Wuchow, or Kinhua as it is called today. 347. The practice in Wushing is even simpler. Here the scales are not removed from the twigs and hence the soaking becomes unnecessary. The twigs are cut into small lengths, each bearing some scales, and then wrapped up. The practice in Szechuan is essentially the same as that in Kinhua except that the twig-cuttings bearing scales are stored under shelter for about a week before they are soaked in water. 348. The date for collecting these scale-seeds is in general three days before lishia (May 5). But it depends more or less on the weather conditions. For Wushing and Shanghai, Hsu KWANG-CHI recommends that it should be done after lishia. In fact, many people in Shanghai, according to this author, start their work entirely at their own discretion. 349. This collection and propagation of the scale-seeds, however, applies only where these seeds are produced locally. But this is not always so, especially where the cultivation of these</page><page sequence="91">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 365 wax insects assumes an important role in rural economy. In Chekiang, the main center of pela-culture is Kinhua where the scale-seeds have to be imported from Shiaoshing, Taichow, and Huchow. In Szechuan, the industry centers in Shitsung and Kiating in the southern part and Kuanshien in the western part. All the scale-seeds have to be brought in from outside. In Kuanshien, according to what the present writer learned in I932, such seeds are imported annually from Kweichow. 350. To supply the demand of thousands of cultivators, the production of the scale-seeds has to become an industry by itself. This is what actually happens. As mentioned before, COOPER found that the eggs of the insect are annually imported from Yunnan where such culture forms a special occupation by itself. According to a recent report, thousands of people in Chuanwei and Yahan in Szechuan, and Huili on the border between Szechuan and Yunnan, depend for their living on this industry of raising scale-seeds. 35I. This specialization creates many practical problems and interesting speculations. The place where the scale-seeds are produced is usually hundreds of miles away from the place where the wax is produced, and moreover the region that separates these two is usually covered with high mountains. The scale- seeds cannot be separated from their host plants too early and should not hatch before reaching their destination. With primi- tive means of transportation over hundreds of miles of rugged and hazardous paths, how to make both ends meet is a difficulty that can be easily imagined. On this point, RECLUSE writes: 352. The insect which produces the wax lives on the leaves of Ligustrum lucidum in the region of Kientchang near Ningyuen. At the end of April, the cultivator collects carefully the eggs of these insects and send them to Kiating, a journey of two weeks on the other side of the mountain chain. The journey is very difficult and it has to be done by night in order to protect the eggs from the heat of the sun. The lights, which one sees from a distance on the zigzag mountain path, are very picturesque. By a unique exception in China, all the gates of Kiatingfu remain constantly open, day and night, during the rush season of the egg-trading. 353. This account explains how the people and the govern- ment cooperate to solve a practical problem. In short, this difficulty is solved, to use a Chinese expression for this occasion, by " selling pela on horseback." But why are not the scale-seeds</page><page sequence="92">366 G. KAN-CHIIH LIU produced in the wax region, but have to be imported under such precarious conditions? COOPER offers an economic explanation. But it is interesting to see what the Chinese have to say on this point. In his Nung Cheng Chuan Shu, Hsu KWANG-CHI writes: 354. People in Kinhua have to procure their scale-seeds from Huchow as people in Kiating obtain theirs from Tungchuan. This is done every year. In answer to my inquiry, it is said that in Kinhua and Kiating, these coccids produce only wax but not seeds. In Kinhua there are still some native seeds which cost only about half as much as the imported ones. But in Kiating, no scale-seeds are produced at all and consequently the price is almost about ten times as high as it is in Tungchuan. Why scale-seeds cannot be produced from the wax country is difficult to understand. 355. This problem has been in my mind for a long time. It seems to me that many factors are involved. The age and the height of the tree, the number of insects on each tree, and the country from where the scale-seeds come-all appear to play a part in this strange situation. In general, more wax is produced on the younger and the lower trees while more seeds are produced on the older and the taller ones. Trees with less insects will produce more seeds and less wax and trees with more insects will produce more wax and less seeds. Furthermore, scale-seeds from the north will produce more wax in the south and seeds from the south will produce more seeds in the north. 356. This is shown by the fact that the seeds from Huchow will produce only wax in Kinhua and the seeds from Kinhua will produce only wax in Fukien. It is for this reason that the seeds from Kinhua are shipped to Fukien and from Fukien further transferred to Wushing. But if the seeds from Kinhua were shipped to Huchow, they will produce only seeds again. This is evidently due to the location of Kinhua in relation to Wushing and Fukien; the former being to its north and the latter to its south. 357. The same is true in Szechuan. The seeds from Tungchuan will produce only wax in Kiating. But if the seeds in Kiating were shipped to Tung- chuan, then they will produce seed again. This is because Tungchuan is in the north while Kiating is in the south. The basic principle seems to me to be the fact that wax will be produced where it is warmer and the seeds where it is colder. The difference caused by the age and the height of the tree are fundamentally the same as those caused by location. 358. This statement is very interesting because the author evidently tried to view this situation from a physiological basis. It may be pointed out that elsewhere the same author made the remark that both the wax and the seeds can be produced at the same time in the same locality. In the above quotation, he seems also to imply that either one must be produced at the expense of the other. 359. The next problem of propagation arises from the food plant. The tree cannot be subjected to an incessant drain on its vitality. It must have its term of rest during which to recuperate.</page><page sequence="93">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 367 Otherwise, it will be so weakened as to undermine its own existence and will not be able to provide subsistence for its parasites. 360. There are two systems in practice to protect the trees: one may be called one-year fallow, and the other, three-years fallow. According to Hsu KWANG-CHI, the tree can be used as a food plant as long as it remains healthy and vigorous. But as soon as it shows sign of depletion, it must be left alone and well fertilized until it recovers. This is the one-year fallow mentioned in the Sung Shih Tsa Pu. As to the three-years fallow, this agriculturist writes: 36I. The three-years fallow starts with the saplings. These are used as food plants when they are about an inch in diameter. After each crop, they are cut back about three or four feet from the ground. Fertilizers are applied both immediately after cutting and during winter. This practice is followed for the next two years. At the end of this period, they are employed as food plants for the next three years consecutively without any other treatment. 362. Hsu KWANG-CHI maintains that his systems are the same as those given in the Sung Shih Tsa Pu. But from what we see today, the recommendation in this book appears to be more liberal. According to this book, " The trees should be allowed to rest for three years after three consecutive crops of wax." In another place, it says: " After the scales are collected, the tree should be cut above the ground. Next year raise the insects on the new shoots. But there should be a fallow every other year. If the tree is pruned after each crop, there will not be any old trunk." It is plain that the recommendation of this book is different from those given by Hsu KWANG-CHI. 363. The actual distribution of the scale-seeds among the host plants is a fairly simple operation. As mentioned before, these coccids are all wrapped into small bundles. With one of the corners of these bundles cut open as an exit for the young insects to escape, these bundles are simply suspended, by means of string, among the twigs. However, some judgment is also necessary. The twigs under which these bundles are suspended should not be too big (or too old) or too small (or too young). The right thickness is that of a finger. On the other hand, the amount of scale-seeds to be assigned to each tree must be deter- mined by the size of the tree. According to CHANG TSUNG-FA, for a tree with a diameter of about one foot, one cup will be the</page><page sequence="94">368 G. KAN-CHIH LIU right amount. This " cup " probably refers to the ordinary teacup used in China. After the scale-seeds are distributed among their food plants, the only work left is to watch out for the birds which may destroy the insects before they emerge from the bundles. 364. From the above account it is plain that the pela-culture, although a fairly simple operation, still takes a certain amount of intuition. How the utilization of these insects was discovered, who first invented the melting process of extraction, and how the industry became so specialized as to require a different region for the production of scale-seeds, are all interesting problems for future study. It appears to the present writer that this is perhaps another case in which an insect is found to force its service on the Chinese (the first case is the silkworm). The profuse multi- plication of these wax insects on the tree covering it with their secretion about an inch thick, as described by COOPER, cannot fail to appeal to the utilitarian imagination of the practical Chinese Once the process of extracting the wax was discovered, and the discovery ought to be easy for a people who knew how to extract silk, the application of the wax to the candle industry needs no p romotion. V. - CONCLUSIONS 365. The late LAUFER of the Field Museum in Chicago was the first one to make a study of the Chinese insects from a cultural point of view. LAUFER's study is confined to the cricket. Our present review of these homopterous insects shows that they are also deeply embedded in Chinese life, although somewhat in a less conspicuous way. 366. It is interesting to notice that the Chinese seem to take more interest in developing the beneficial insects than in trying to prevent the damage caused by the destructive ones. Taking the homopterous group as a whole, probably very few Chinese ever suspect that these insects are injurious. The reason for this ignorance is evidently due to the fact that the damage caused by these insects is elusive and gradual and also due to the fact that,</page><page sequence="95">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 369 on account of the lack of magnifying power, the morphological structure of these insects is little understood. But it is more interesting to notice that the utilization of the Chinese galls and the white-wax are discoveries made long after written history has begun. In view of the enormous amount of energy and money spent on insect control in our modern times all over the world, these facts cannot fail to attract one's attention. Whether the modern scientific spirit will change the outlook of the Chinese is a good topic for speculation. VI. - THE SILVER-FISH (Lepisma saccharina LINN.) 367. According to our modern conception, the silver-fish, or swifts as they are sometimes called in English, are generally considered as one of the most primitive insects. Agile and small, they lead generally a secluded life. Nevertheless, through their close association with such personal effects as clothes and books, their history in China is almost as old as Chinese civilization; at least they can claim their record is as old as that of any other insect in the East. What is of particular interest to us is the fact that this long history provides us with another instance where we see an outline of the development of the Chinese mind, broadly speaking, more or less similar to the one projected by the history of the homopterous insects. These silver-fish have poems written on them, and their habits and habitats recorded for them. But they have also built on them stories of mis- conceptions and superstitions, which are, in turn, condemned and discarded. The only difference seems to be that they are definitely recognized as nuisance and many methods have been devised for their control. All these points will be discussed below under the following headings: i. Biology of the silver-fish. 2. Misconceptions and superstitions. 3. Methods of control. 4. Uses in medicine. 24</page><page sequence="96">370 G. KAN-CHIH LIU i. - BIOLOGY OF THE SILVER-FISH 368. The silver-fish, known in science as L. saccharina, are cosmopolitan. Being associated. with man, they are found all over the world. But it seems to be only in China where they have the longest record. It may be mentioned here, however, that the so-called " Yin Shih,"' or History of the Silverfish, a book by MENG SHIH-WEN, who lived during the Ming dynasty (1368- I644), is rather misleading. The book does include notes on insects and some of these notes may be even regarded as original; but it by no means limits itself to the treatment of the silver-fish alone, as the name would have us believe. The " silver-fish" here corresponds exactly to the English " bookworm," which the author employs to describe his modesty. 369. Since the Erh Yah, where the insect is known under the name, yin, and defined as " pei-yu," or white-fish, the Chinese have built up a fairly large amount of literature on the silver-fish. The figures (FIGS. i6-x8) included here are reproduced from the Cheng Lei Pentsao (iio8), the Pentsao Kang Mu (1578), and the Tu Su Chi Chen (I 725). So far as accuracy is concerned, the first one is the best. Here the insects are correctly represented with three pairs of legs. On account of the small size of these insects and the lack of magnifying power then, this accuracy should claim the credit it deserves. The third one also has its merit in showing the environment. But the one given in the Pentsao Kang Mu is nothing but a sketch. The author here does not seem to care whether the insects have two pairs of legs or four. 370. Before the Tang dynasty (6i8-907), the general habits of these insects appear to be also well understood. WANG TSUNG (born 27 A.D.) is the first one to point out that, if clothes and books were left in storage too long, they might be ruined by these insects. Kou Pu (276-324), the annotator of the Erh Yah, did not have much to add except the name, bin-yu, he introduced. But the poet, LI YUAN, gave us another surprise. The reader may recall that this poet had a fu on the ecdysis of cicadas. In his poem on the pi-yu (wall-fish), he writes: These powdery insects with minute scales may cause great damage to books where they live. They are very common in a study where they may be found on the window sill which does not seem to form any barrier to their passage</page><page sequence="97">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 371 to the outside and they may be caught in an inkstand where they seem to be able to swim. They move very fast when they are disturbed. This free translation loses all the beauty of the original text. That the minute scales of these insects should be recognized so early is remarkable. 37I. The Sung dynasty also has its contribution. Besides pointing out the branched tails, Ko TSUNG-PI in his Pentsao Yen Yi (i ii6) reports that these insects attack not only books, papers, and clothes but also silk. He also makes the remark that they are called fish because they look like fish. Loo YUAN, who seems to have studied these insects quite carefully, makes a different contribution. In his Erh Yah Yi (II74), he states that "they are at first yellow but later become white with powder." Besides thesz two, the poem by SHAO YUNG, also from this period, will be discussed under the methods of control. 372. From a scientific point of view, however, the contribution of the Ming dynasty seems to surpass all these earlier ones. The work of LI Su is especially important and will be discussed in connection with the misconceptions and superstitions. LI SHIH- CHEN, the great physician, presents to us rather a confusing picture. In his Pentsao Kang Mu, the insects are figured but these figures are far from being accurate. Furthermore, the fact that these insects are classified under hua-sen (spontaneous generation) indicates that the author does not know the insect enough. These objections, however, should not make one to overlook his contri- bution. The following is his account: The clothes-fish are called white-fish because they are white; wall-fish because they are also commonly found on the wall; silver-fish because they look like silver; handle-fish because of the form of their tails. They live among clothes, silk, books, and paintings. At first they are bluish but later become white with powder which can be used to mark paper and stationery. The popular belief that one can become an immortal by swallowing these insects is perhaps wrong and should be corrected. 373. It may be pointed out that in medical writings it is customary to call these insects " clothes-fish." True, this physician does not have much to add to our knowledge of these insects; what he states here has been practically mentioned before. But so far as the present writer is aware, his account is the most complete. Furthermore, we owe to him the record that these insects were used to mark papers and stationery.</page><page sequence="98">372 G. KAN-CHIH LIU 2. - MISCONCEPTIONS AND SUPERSTITIONS 374. Facts and fancies, just like right and might, seem always to compete for supremacy in the world; at least one does not seem to be able to check the growth of the other. True, the Chinese had not made any exhaustive study on the morphology and life history of these insects. But the few facts mentioned in the last section indicate that the insects were more or less well understood by the ancient Chinese. It is strange, therefore, that misconceptions and superstitions still find chance to flourish. What is especially curious is the fact that both suddenly occur during the Tang dynasty. The following is the misconception one finds in the U Yang Tsa Chou: LEITSE once made the remark that rotten melon changes into fish. This state- ment was abstruse to me until one day CHANG CHOU, who was a puchueh in the government, told me that he had seen the transmutation of the white melon seeds on the wall into white-fish. LEITSE might refer to this fact. 375. Those who are not familiar with rural conditions in China may not know what these " white melon seeds on the wall mean. This, is a practice, still common to-day, which the farmers employ for the preservation of the seeds intended for propagation. The seeds are mixed with ashes and water, kneaded into a cake, pasted on the wall, and left there till the next season. 376. The fallacy of the above quotation appears to lie not in the observation but in the interpretation. On account of the shelter provided by this cake and the crevices offered by the uneven surface of the ordinary mud wall, it would not be strange if the insects should take a temporary lodging under this seed- cake. CHANG CHOU might have actually observed their emergence therefrom. But if one takes this emergence to mean that the insects are transmuted from the seeds, the interpretation, of course, is erroneous. 377. This misconception does not seem to be of much con- sequence. It might be just one of those academic speculations which are generally neglected by the public. But the effect of the superstition appears to be quite serious. Ho FENG was a scholar. In the last year of CHIEN TSUNG (780-783), he bought a rare book which was printed on yellow paper. In examining the book, he found</page><page sequence="99">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 373 a curious object which is as thin as a hair but with the ends connected to form a ring. He picked it up and cut it and to his surprise, about a pine of water dripped out from each end. Then he burned it and it smelt like hair. Years late r he met a Taoist and told him his experience. On hearing his account, the Taoist felt very sorry for Ho FENG and told him: " You are born a mortal and you missed your chance to become an immortal. The hair- thread you found in that book is what is known as ' meh-wong ' and is transformed from the silver-fish which has eaten three 'sunshuan' in the book. If one holds this meh-zwong against the star in the dark, the messenger of the star will im- mediately descend from the sky to wait on the order of the holder. From this messenger one can obtain immortal pills. On the other hand, if one swallows this meh-zwong with water, his bones will be changed from those of a mortal to those of an immortal." At first Ho FENG was rather incredulous about the truth of this statement. But when he discovered, on examining the book again, that the words which disappeared from the passage were actually the words of "sunshuan," he saw the chance he had missed. He regretted so much that he suddenly burst into tears. 378. This account is found also in the U Yang Tsa Chou. Here the superstition ends perhaps only with the disappointment which was expressed in a loud wailing. But in the next case, one sees what harm it may do. The following account is the one given by SUN KWANG-SHIEN in his Pei Meng Sio Yen: CHANG YANG, once a shangshu (president of a certain board) in the government, had five sons. The first four were well famed as scholars but I forgot the name of the youngest one. There was a popular belief that if a silver-fish happened to find its way into the Tao Ching (Classics of the Taoism) and devour the words, " sunshuan," it will show five colors on its body, and that if one caught this silver- fish and swallowed it, one would become an immortal and would ascend from the earth to live in the celestial kingdom. This belief appealled strongly to the imagination of this youngster. He wrote down on a piece of paper a number of the words, " sunshuan," cut the paper into small pieces, and put them into a vase in which he released a number of silver-fish he had collected. In so doing, he hoped that the insects will eat the " sunshuan " and he would swallow the insects in order to become an immortal. He was so intent on his experiment, which evidently did not turn out as he had expected, that finally he became insane. For months he would refuse to eat and would not hesitate to use the most profane language. Under such circum- stances his familv found it necessary to lock him up. But when such fits were over, he was normal again and would make up for the amount of food he had missed. This insanity was continued to the end of his life, which occurred many years later. 379. SUN KWANG-SHIEN lived during the Five Dynasties (907-960). This superstition appeared to be quite popular during the Tang dynasty. In addition to the two accounts given above, a similar version is also found in the work of Tu Pu (7I2-770). That its fallacy was known even during this period is shown by</page><page sequence="100">374 G. KAN-CHIH LIU the fact that it was deplored by SUN KWANG-SHIEN himself Later Su SUNG, the physician, also denounced it in strong terms as shown in the following account: The clothes-fish are found everywhere but they are more common in books than in clothes. They are covered with powder which can be rubbed off. The account given by TUAN CHEN-SHIH on the transmutation and the one given by SUN KWANG-SHIEN on the superstition are all humbug and should be corrected. 380. It is LU Su, however, who gave us the best statement. In his Chien Wu (i582), he writes: There are insects which are known to live on paste. The ;hiang, now commonly called " da-loo-tchang," are among them. They look like pillbugs but are very small. They live on paper paste or in crevices of bamboo and wood. They can jump and this jumping, when taken in unison by a number of them at the same time, produces a rhythmic sound. The statement made by TUAN CHEN- CHIH on the transmutation is entirely wrong. These insects are produced by antecedent insects of their kind. They are very small and live on paste. The melon seeds are probably one of their provisions. I have seen myself that they even attack furs and candles. Those that live in clothes are called clothes-fish. When people hear the sound of the shiang but cannot see the insects themselves, they think that they are ghost and assert that it would be unlucky to see them. They also believe that if the silver-fish eat the " sunshuan " in the book, they would form a ring and that if a person should swallow such an insect, he could become an immortal. But who has ever seen a person haunted by the shiang, or become an immortal by taking the silver-fish? 38i. This account is very interesting. The author knew evidently more species of these primitive insects than the classical silver-fish but regarded them all as one. Judging by the small size, the pillbug form, and the jumping habit, his shiang is probably what we know in English as the spring-tail which is also considered nowadays as one of the primitive insects but belongs to a different order, the Collembola. The author's attitude is particularly acceptable to us. He raised no objection to the belief but asked only for facts to substantiate it. 382. How this superstition should have ever arisen is difficult to understand, especially its sudden appearance during the Tang dynasty. Its association with Taoism appears to be quite plain. But the reverence the Chinese have for their books and the fact that these insects dare to attack such revered objects perhaps may contribute to its general acceptance. This assump- tion may be inferred from the attitude taken by Ho YI-SHING (I757-i825) towards these insects. In his Erh Yah Yen Yi, he writes:</page><page sequence="101">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 375 According to my observation, the silver-fish are about half an inch long. With their tails branched, they are strongly suggestive of a fish with pleasing powdery appearance. They are also called wall-fish or goh-yu (borer-fish); the last name is because of the fact that formerly books were not printed on paper but carved on bamboo. These insects have been known for a long time and, because of the fact that they live on the essence and flower of the book, they are different from ordinary insects. Ho YI-SHING made no reference to the superstition and miscon- ception but his last statement indicates clearly what he thought of these insects. So far as the present writer is aware, the only case which may approach the Chinese superstition is the English " silver-witch." But what story the English have for this name is not known. 383. Concerning the misconceptions, the statement found in the Yuan Gien Lei Han (1710) should also be mentioned. This voluminous book is more or less of an encyclopedic nature and was compiled under the imperial edict of Emperor KONGSI. Here the silver-fish are asserted to be originated (sen) from warm humid weather. But the original " sen " may be also inter- preted as " live in." It is not certain which of these two the author had in mind when he made the statement. 384. Before conclusion, it may be interesting perhaps to see what the early Europeans had to say about these insects. As the scientific name indicates, these insects were known to LINNAEUS whose account consists of less than a dozen words and is no better than those given by those early scholars in China. Of particular interest is the one given by R. HOOKE, who first examined the insects under magnification. In his Micrographia (i66S), he writes: It is a small white Silver-shining Worm or Moth, which I found much conversant among Books and Papers, and is suppos'd to be that which corrodes and eats holes through leaves and covers; it appears to the naked eye a small glittering Pearl-coloured Moth, which, upon the removing of Books and Papers in summer, is often observ'd very nimbly to scud, and pack away to some lurking cranney where it may the better protect itself from any appearing dangers. Its head appears big and blunt and its body tapers from it towards the tail smaller and smaller, being shap'd almost like a carrot. 385. HOOKE gave a huge figure in the work just mentioned. Although he had examined the insect under magnification, his report is also not much better than those found in Chinese litera- ture. It is interesting to notice the terms, worm and moth,</page><page sequence="102">376 G. KAN-CHIH LIU he employed. According to modern conception, these insects, of course, are neither worm nor moth. 3. - THE METHODS OF CONTROL 386. No entomologist today would question that the silver- fish are pests. Too many cases are on record of the damage they have done. In the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University, 700 labels on a collection of paleontological specimens were known to be all injured by them. But if the statement of BUTLER is true, these insects were not finally condem- ned in Europe until the end of the nineteenth century. In his Household Insects (i893), BUTLER writes: This curious little creature has had a varying reputation; at one time being regarded as harmless, and at others accused of causing serious damage. There is abundant evidence to show that the latter is the true view. Why the Europeans were slow to pass the sentence is rather dif- ficult to understand. On the other hand, the Chinese have recognized these insects as pests a long, long time ago and have known that they attack not only books, papers, clothes, and silk but also furs and candles. As will be shown later, this knowledge was even employed by the emperors as one of the means to win and to cultivate the fidelity of their followers. 387. The methods of control as practiced by the Chinese may be grouped into repelling, drying, and appeasing. Chrono- logically speaking, the last one is the latest; at least so far as records are concerned. It is adopted evidently as a result of the failure of the other two. The procedure is rather simple. Accord- ing to the Bi Ko Shian Hua, " If one offers a sacrifice to the insect on New Year's Eve, calls them by name, and says one's pray, one will not be bothered by them for the coming year." How effective this method will be, of course, is open to question. But it may achieve its psychological comfort. The author of this book is lost. When it was published is not known; but it is found in the Shai Fu, a work by TAO KIU-CHEN who lived during the later part of the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). 388. The drying method is much earlier. It was first men- tioned by SHIAO YUNG (0I0I-I077) in his poem on the wall-fish and consists of exposing the books and clothes to the sun during</page><page sequence="103">CICADAS IN CHINESE CULTURE 377 summer. Thus Loo YUAN, in his Erh Yah Yi (I174) states that, if books and clothes are left too long in storage, they will be damaged by these insects; and that, as a remedy, it is customary in Ching-tscho (Hunan and Hupeh) to expose them during the seventh month. But the time of exposure recommended by the Chiu Chia Yi Chi (Home Almanac) is different from ordinary practice. This book is included in the Shai Fu but its author is also lost. It states that furs should be exposed on the Human' Day (the seventh of the first month), if one intends to prevent them from the attack of these insects. In this case the heat of the sun does not seem to play any important part because the weather is usually still too cold. 389. The repelling method, still commonly employed today, is making use of the effect of some strongly scented substances to keep the insects away. It is not only the oldest of all but has shown the greatest development. In his Annotation of the Shih Ching, LU CHI (26i-303) writes: The chi-lan is the plant which the emperor used to give as a special gift to the nobles for them to place it among their clothes and books to keep the insects away. Formerly the yun, also a kind of scented plant, was used as a repellent against the insects. Later books were printed on yellow paper which has a bitter taste and hence will be avoided by the insects themselves. 390. According to the Chen Hwai Lu, one of the works of CHOU MI (I232-I308), yun, also known as chi-li-shiang (scented for two miles), is a plant which grows in small bundles. Its leaves look like those of the pea (Pisum sativum L.). It is perhaps what is known today as yun-shiang, or Ruta graveolens. But what this chi-lan is, is not certain. It might be one of those orchidaceous plants. Other scented plants, like the lan-shiang (Ocimum basilicum) and ko-hou (Incarvillea sinensis), are also mentioned by various writers to be used for the same purpose. In one of the medical writings, both meng-tsao (Illicium anisatum) and hwo-chue (Lactuca sativa) are also reported to be hostile to the clothes-fish. 39I. Besides these scented plants, yu-shi-tse (fish stone), a mineral from Lungchow, is known to be used also as a repellent. According to Hu SHIH (0506-i644), if this fish-stone is placed among books, it will keep the silver-fish away. What this fish- stone is, is not clear. Furthermore, there are two places which</page><page sequence="104">378 G. KAN-CHIH LIU formerly were known as Lungchow; one in Shensi and the other in Kansu. At present it is not certain which one the author referred to. But there seems to be no question that the yu-shi-tse is a kind of mineral. 4. - USES IN MEDICINE 392. Although the silver-fish are generally considered as a nuisance, they are well received in the medical world. Not only are they mentioned in the Herbal, one of the oldest medical writings known today; but their utilization has been extended far beyond its original scope. This progress is clearly shown by the fact that, among the twelve prescriptions in the Pentsao Kang Mu, five are reported as old and seven as new. So far as the present writer is aware, the Chinese seem to be the only people who have made use of these insects in medicine. 393. The insects are mentioned practically in all Chinese materia medica. In the Herbal, they are considered as a drug of inferior virtue and recommended for asthmatic troubles in woman, infantile paralysis, and urinary disturbances. TAO HIUNG- CHING first reports their application to moles on the face and recommends it for abortion. By the time of Li SHIH-CHEN, the insects seem to have become a panacea and are applied to a host of ills, both internal and external. Li SHIH-CHEN even advances some theory to explain their function in medicine. But un- fortunately the terms he employs are unintelligible to those who are not in his profession. The insects are said to be mildly salty and non-poisonous. 394. It appears that formerly the insects were even more highly regarded by the medical men and that some of their old formulae had been lost to posterity. This is the opinion enter- tained at least by Li SHIH-CHEN, the great physician. Harvard University. GAINES KAN-CHIH Liu.
