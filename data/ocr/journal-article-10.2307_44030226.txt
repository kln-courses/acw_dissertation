<plain_text><page sequence="1">By examining the relationship between sovereignty and the unconditional in several of Derrida's works from Speech and Phenomenon to Glas, "Faith and Knowledge" to Sovereignties in Question , this paper asks whether a deconstructive thinking of sovereignty can help determine and change for the better the deconstructive processes already at work in ourselves, our political systems, and our religious institutions. Comme si, comme ça: Phantasms of Self, State, and a Sovereign God MICHAEL NAAS It of "Following is coming hard not after Derrida." to him, wonder following For what those Jacques after of us him, here Derrida or who continuing follow would Derrida, have to read done and either with study in a the title him, sense like we "Following Derrida." For those of us here who follow Derrida, either in the sense of coming after him, following after him, or continuing to read and study him, we have no doubt all asked ourselves on several occasions over the past two years what Jacques Derrida would have done or thought about this or that, how he would have responded to some discourse or event. Though we speculate and, I think, should con- tinue to speculate, since that is part of following him, we will never know - and must not claim to know. How would Jacques Derrida have responded to a title like "Following Derrida"? We simply do not know, we cannot know, though were I to speculate, and I think we must speculate, I believe he would have tried to turn us away from thinking of ourselves as either the heirs of a bygone past, those who simply come after him, or those who tag along after him as his followers or, worse, his disciples. He would have turned us instead, I would like to believe, toward a promise of the future that we Mosaic 40/2 0027-1276-07/001026$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) would in fact be following or trying to follow after, a promise that goes by the name "Derrida" even if he himself, Jacques Derrida himself, was always following it. In short, he would have turned us toward following the future as the best way of refusing to make of him a father or a master or an icon, the best way of keeping us from think- ing that he himself embodied the promise that he in fact was following, the best way, in the end, of dispelling any phantasm about him.1 I like to think, therefore, that Jacques Derrida would have seen in the title "Following Derrida" not simply an act of memory or remembrance but an invitation to think, from out of this memory, about the future - and about this memory as the future. Before trying to continue to follow him in this way, then, let me take this occasion to thank those responsible for this invitation, the journal Mosaic , and especially Dawne McCance and her assistant Lisa Muirhead, for the boundless creativity, energy, kind- ness, and hospitality they have shown in the organization of this conference, indeed, for the invitation they have extended to each of us to think about how we might fol- low Derrida today in the future. It is a pleasure, an honour, and a daunting responsi- bility - especially since, in a room such as this, so many of you know so much about the work of Derrida, for example, to name just one, my former teacher Hugh Silverman, the person with whom I took my first class on Derrida a couple of decades back at Stony Brook. It was in large part thanks to that class that I myself began fol- lowing Silverman following Derrida. Let me thank him here publicly for that. Now, I said a moment ago that while we cannot know how Derrida would have responded to this conference, I wager that he would have done what he could to dis- pel any phantasm of being a father or a master or an icon for us, a sovereign gaze that would watch over and determine everything we say and do, that would run all our words and deeds through a Derridean censor that perpetually makes us ask in that popular idiom, "what would Jacques do?" Such an inflexible law, such a sovereign power, would have the effect of submitting everything we say and do not simply to the memory or specter of Jacques Derrida, to his living on in us, but to our phantasm of him. As I will try to argue in what follows, to treat the memory of Jacques Derrida in this way, to treat him as if he were here, watching and judging us, passing judgment in advance over what we do, would be the beginning of a phantasm, the beginning of an as if a comme si, that tries to pass itself off as an as so, a like so or a like that, a comme ça. From comme si to comme ça, from the comme si of a speculative fiction to the comme ça of an inflexible law - that is the nature, the conventional but seemingly natural nature, of a phantasm - the kind that Jacques Derrida spent so much of his work warning us against by calling into question and submitting to a vigilant cri- tique - and right up to the end.</page><page sequence="3">Michael Naas 3 I will thus look at three such fictions or phantasms - the sovereignties of the self, the nation-state, and God - in order to understand Derrida's insistence that we must ultimately relinquish sovereignty, the phantasm of sovereignty and the sovereignty of the phantasm, in the name of the very thing that has traditionally been identified with it, that is, in the name of the unconditional. The fictions and phantasmatic powers of sovereignty must be given up, Derrida suggests, in the name of the unconditionality of the event or the unconditional coming of the other, since, without such a renunci- ation, there can be no ethics and there will be no future. Though sovereignty - be it the sovereignty of a self-determining or self-legislating individual, of a self-sufficient or self-founding nation-state, or of a single, all-powerful God - is today undergoing critique or deconstruction of its own accord, so to speak (in accordance with what Derrida has called an ineluctable "autoimmune process"), this deconstruction nonetheless remains for us an essential task. Following Derrida's thinking about the phantasms of self, state, and a sovereign God, I will inevitably conclude that at a time such as ours when the power of the phantasm shows no signs of abating, a thought like Derrida's - the haunting thought of Derrida - becomes all the more vital. Though the 1970s and 1980s will continue to be characterized by the theory textbooks as the "heyday of deconstruction," I would like to suggest that now may really be the time to be "following Derrida." I say this, I hope, without phantasm or illusion. Specter, words are, ghost, as phantom, we know, at spectrality, the centre fantomaticity, of Derrida's hauntology, work, and already phantasm: from these the words are, as we know, at the centre of Derrida's work, and already from the beginning, even if they have the appearance of becoming more explicit and central in the final two decades of his life. I will not rehearse here the relationship between what Derrida calls dissemination, différance, or iterability and spectrality or hauntology. Some of you right here, in fact, such as my friend Kas Saghafi, have already done this work, and done it in an exemplary fashion (see Sagafi, "The Ghost o/Jacques Derrida"). It thus no longer needs to be shown how Derrida, almost from the beginning, spoke of the "spectral errancy of words," of the "ineluctable originarity of the specter," of a reve- nance of the mark that "does not befall words by accident" but conditions them "from their first emergence," of the trace as being related from its first inscription to an orig- inary mourning and a certain kind of living on ("Shibboleth" 53). Though the notion of the phantasm undoubtedly belongs to this same set of words or quasi-concepts, I would like to try to reserve for it a rather special use and status in Derrida's work. I will try to situate this special status by asking, first, just what a phantasm is, what contexts it emerges in, what problems - of individual iden- tity formation, nation-station identification, or religious understanding - it helps us</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) to diagnose and, finally, what promises a critique of the phantasm at the level of the individual, the nation-state, and religion can hold for us today.2 Though the notion of the "phantasm" appears in many earlier works, from Speech and Phenomenon to Glas , to name just two, I would like to begin this reading of Derrida's phantasms in one of Derrida's most autobiographical works, Monolin- gualism of the Other. Appearing, then, in a genre of writing that typically assumes a coincidence or identity between the one writing and the one being written about, this text introduces, it seems, a certain non-coincidence, non-simultaneity, or de-identifi- cation between the self and itself, the self that is writing and the self being written about. This should come as little surprise, of course, since one of the very first lessons of deconstruction is that a certain difference or distance is necessary to the produc- tion of what would seem to come before it, the living presence of a self in absolute proximity to itself, the immediate presence of a self hearing itself speak and so assum- ing within itself the meaning of a vouloir dire. But in Monolingualism of the Other, this classic Derridean theme is cast in a slightly different light, that is, in the light of the phantasm. Speaking of the fact that the language one speaks is always the other's and that there is, thus, an inalienable alienation within one's own speech, Derrida writes: "This structure of alienation without alienation, this inalienable alienation, is not only the origin of our responsibility, it also structures the peculiarity and property of lan- guage. It institutes the phenomenon of hearing-oneself-speak in order to mean-to-say [pour vouloir dire] . But here, we must say the phenomenon as phantasm . Let us refer for the moment to the semantic and etymological affinity that associates the phantasm to the phainesthaiy to phenomenality, but also to the spectrality of the phenomenon. Phantasma is also the phantom, the double, or the ghost" (25). Here we have, bundled into one tight paragraph, many of the words I mentioned earlier: phantasm, phantom, ghost, spectrality. But are these all quasi-synonyms or non-substitutable synonyms for the same phenomenon? Derrida ends the passage I just cited by speaking of the spec- trality of the phenomenon, that is, I take it, the intrinsic possibility of doubling and iter- ation that makes any phenomenal appearance possible. Spectrality would be one of those non-synonymous substitutes for what was once called iterability or différance. As for phantasm, it comes, as Derrida points out, from the same semantic "family" as phe- nomenon, namely phainesthaiy meaning to appear, become apparent, become phenom- enal. The point would seem to be that iterability or spectrality is the condition, so to speak, of every coming to appear, including the coming to appear of oneself to oneself or the coming to hear oneself speak in a meaning-to-say or a vouloir dire. But this spec- trality or "inalienable alienation" then "institutes," Derrida says, "the phenomenon of hearing-oneself-speak in order to mean-to-say [pour vouloir dire]? that is, it institutes</page><page sequence="5">Michael Naas 5 "the phenomenon as phantasm ." Spectrality would seem to be the condition of phe- nomenality as well as of that particular kind of phenomenon called the phantasm. Without having, at this point, to circumscribe the field of the phantasm in relation to other kinds of phenomena, we can see coming to light one defining characteristic of the phantasm: the phantasm suggests or leads us to believe in a non-alienation of the self from itself in language, it leads us to believe in a coincidence of the self that speaks and the self that hears itself speak in a vouloir dire, the immediate apprehension of a self by itself in a vouloir dire. The very first phenomenon as phantasm would thus seem to be the phantasm of hearing oneself speak in order to mean-to-say. Though the phan- tasm as phenomenon, as an appearing to the self, always introduces appearance, iter- ability, and, thus, difference into every self-relation, the phenomenon of the phantasm suggests an expulsion, repression, or purification of this phenomenon. The phantasm is thus both the phenomenon of the phantasm and the suppression or repression of the phantasm as phenomenon, the lure of a phantasm, then, beyond the phenome- non - the lure of a phantasm purified of the phenomenon and, as we shall see in a moment, the lure of a phantasm of purity. Just a few pages later in Monolingualism of the Other, Derrida explicitly relates the phantasm to purity and to deconstruction. In the midst of those pages where Derrida avows that the only purity he ever loved and ever sought in himself was the purity of the French language, he writes: "I have never ceased calling into question the motif of 'purity' in all its forms," and then he opens a parenthesis to add, "the first impulse of what is called 'deconstruction' carries it toward this 'critique' of the phantasm or of the axiom of purity, or toward the analytical decomposition of a purification that would lead back to the indecomposable simplicity of the origin" (46). Deconstruction would thus be, first and foremost, a deconstruction of the phantasm, a deconstruction of any putatively pure origin, indeed, of any phantasm of purity and of a simple, seemingly self-evident or axiomatic, origin, any indivisible, inviolable center.3 If one returns to Speech and Phenomena and to the critique of pure auto-affec- tion in a meaning to say, one will find, I think, all the premises for Derrida's later thinking about the phantasm. While Derrida is careful to point out that Husserl him- self distinguishes the transcendental ego from the "formal or metaphysical phantom I fantôme] of the empirical ego," Derrida will, through an analysis of language and expression in Husserl, displace the transcendental ego within a more general structure of différance or of what will later come to be known as spectrality (12). The purity and indivisibility of self-presence will be compromised not by the phantom of an empirical ego within the transcendental ego, but by a transcendental ego that is shown to be the effect of the phenomenon of expression. By demonstrating, in effect,</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) that the purity of auto-affection, the purity of a self speaking to itself in a vouloir dire, is compromised both by the relation to others who first give me my language and by a structure of différance that opens the purity of meaning to repetition and difference, Derrida can argue that "this movement of difference is not something that happens to a transcendental subject; it produces a subject. Auto-affection is not a modality of expe- rience that characterizes a being that would already be itself (autos). It produces same- ness as self-relation within self-difference; it produces sameness as the nonidentical" (82). The critique or deconstruction of auto-affection, of the putative purity of auto- affection, is thus, one would be tempted to say using a later language, a critique of the phantasm of auto-affection by means of a general theory of spectrality or iterability. But what produces this phantasm exactly? Derrida gives us some clue in a passage right before the one I just cited: "Even while repressing [tout en refoulant] difference by assigning it to the exteriority of the signifiers, Husserl could not fail to recognize its work at the origin of sense and presence. Taking auto-affection as the exercise of the voice, auto-affection supposed that a pure difference comes to divide self-presence. In this pure difference is rooted the possibility of everything we think we can exclude [tout ce qu'on croit pouvoir exclure] from auto-affection: space, the outside, the world, the body, etc." (82, emph. mine). Two phrases need to be underscored here: "even while repressing" and "everything we think [or believe] we can exclude." Repression and belief - we will want to follow the relationship between these and the phantasm in everything that follows. For only these - and especially the latter - will allow us to take into account the force and tenacity of a phantasm that, metaphysically speaking, does not exist but that we believe exists, a phantasm that would be nothing other than a belief in a phenomenon that transcends itself, that spontaneously gives rise to itself - like an Immaculate Conception. For, in any consideration of the phantasm, one must be interested less in the ontological status of the phantasm than in its staying power, its returning power, I would be tempted to say its regenerative power. In a word, one must be interested in the fact that, to cite an English idiom, the phantasm has "legs." Auto-affection is thus an effect of difference, not that which precedes and com- mands it. As Derrida puts it in Speech and Phenomena , "Hearing oneself speak is not the inwardness of an inside that is closed in upon itself; it is the irreducible openness in the inside; it is the eye and the world within speech" (86). The eye and the world - and, I would add, the possibility of the phantasm - are thus now displaced or inscribed within language. The "phenomenon of language" is, hence, the starting point for Derrida to question, critique, or deconstruct the phenomenon of the phantasm, the phenomenon of a phantasm that makes us believe in a phenomenon that can do without phenomenality, iterabilty, or spectrality. Just after invoking on the final page</page><page sequence="7">Michael Naas 7 of Speech and Phenomena the flight of Icarus who, like the phone , rises up toward the "sun of presence" and, thus, is fated to fall, Derrida writes: "And contrary to what phe- nomenology - which is always phenomenology of perception - has tried to make us believe, contrary to what our desire cannot fail to be tempted into believing , the thing itself always escapes" (104, emph. mine). Even if the thing thus always escapes, the phenomenon of the phantasm cannot fail to be sustained by the temptation of a desire that leads, once again, to belief. The first phantasm would thus appear to be the phantasm of a self purely pres- ent to itself, a self able to hear and coincide with itself in the immediacy of a vouloir dire , through signs that are understood immediately and without delay - that is, through signs that go beyond the sign. Beyond or just beyond this first phantasm would be a self that believes - that desires - that it can bring what it engenders back into its orbit. In "Passions" - a text written three years before Monolingualism of the Other - Derrida writes: "The infinite paradoxes of what is so calmly called narcissism are outlined here: suppose that X, something or someone (a trace, a work, an institu- tion, a child) bears your name, that is to say your title. The naïve rendering or com- mon phantasm [fantasme courant: common illusion] is that you have given your name to X, thus all that returns to X, in a direct or indirect way, in a straight or an oblique line, returns to you, as a profit for your narcissism" (11-12). Though such narcissism, such a "common phantasm" or "illusion," is, in the end, always frustrated by the paradoxes of narcissism, it nonetheless remains. Though "narcissism is frustrated a priori by that from which it profits or hopes to profit" (12), though it is forever and a priori frustrated by the phenomenon of narcissism, since we are not our name or our title or our children, it remains a common phantasm - and a common theoretical phantasm, as Pleshette DeArmitt has shown in some of her recent work.4 Though there are a million signs every day to counter this narcissism and this naïve theory, they nonetheless resist, and only a thinking of the phantasm can help explain this resistance. Indeed, what interests me here is the persistence of a "common phantasm" despite its frustration, the effects, affects, and attachments of a phantasm that is "in truth" always frustrated. Derrida makes this perfectly clear in Paper Machine. In the context of a passage on the putative intimacy and self-proxim- ity of handwriting, Derrida speaks of the " fantasies [phantasmes] of contact, of caress, of intimacy, proximity, resistance, or promise." He continues: "These are certainly fan- tasies. The word condenses all together image, spectrality, and simulacrum - and the weight of desire, the libidinal investment of affect, the motions of an appropriation extended toward that which remains inappropriable, called forth by the inappropri- ate itself, the desperate attempt to turn affection into auto-affection. These fantasies and affects are effectiveness itself . . ." (63).</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) The cidence phenomenon with itself of and the phantasm its affective thus appropriation first arises in of the everything self's phantasmatic it engenders coin- or cidence with itself and its affective appropriation of everything it engenders or believes it engenders. But in the work of Derrida, it is perhaps most powerfully in the form of the political that the phantasm holds our fascination and accounts for our attachment. In an address delivered in Athens in 1999 under the title Unconditionality or Sovereignty: The University on the Borders of Europe, Derrida makes several enlight- ening remarks about the phantasm. He argues in this work, as he did in several others in the following five years, that one must oppose "two close but heterogeneous repre- sentations of freedom," namely, sovereignty and unconditionality (44; all translations of this text are mine). While sovereignty would name the freedom or seeming free- dom of a sovereign or sovereign state to act and exercise its power, unconditionality would have to do with the unlimited freedom to pursue the truth and to question, to deconstruct, in a word, every form of sovereign power, for example, "the sovereignty of a state, people, monarch, or God" (46-48), the "phantasm of sovereignty that inspires the politics of all state-nationalisms" (48). Though this second freedom, this unconditional freedom to critique, runs the risk of looking like the sovereign power of another sovereign subject, the counter-sovereignty of, say, a critical subject who can contest the sovereignty of the nation-state, the unconditional is, properly speaking, powerless, not a counter-sovereignty with its own power but a force that can disrupt the power of any sovereign phantasm. It was no doubt this risk of unconditional free- dom looking like a counter-sovereignty, let me add in passing, that eventually led Derrida to relate this unconditionality not to the power of a critical performative but to an event that undoes the power of any kind of subject, even a critical or decon- structive subject. Every form of sovereignty thus appears to be a phantasm, and every phantasm a phantasm of sovereignty, the phantasm, for example, of a nation-state that has power, in possession of an origin that is self-grounding, and so on. The principle of sovereignty is thus a principle of the phantasm, what Derrida calls an "archaic principle-phantasm of sovereignty," archaic, as we will see, because it is an arche and because it comes in response to the most archaic impulses or desires for identification and exclusion, the most primitive or archaic expressions of violence. This principle of sovereignty is an archaic phantasm, and it is, Derrida adds, of a "theological origin." "Religion, ethnicity, and the nation-state are bound together," writes Derrida, "in the same sovereignist dis- course" (50). What thus distinguishes "in principle an unconditional freedom of thought" as it is found, for example, at least in principle, in the university, and the sovereignty of the nation-state, is ultimately, Derrida argues, the ideological origin of the concept of sovereignty and the "theologico-political history of power" (58), a history that always</page><page sequence="9">Michael Naas 9 conjoins sovereign power and the notion of an indivisible and all-powerful God. As Derrida writes in "Ulysses Gramophone," "omnipotence remains phantasmatic, it opens and defines the dimensions of phantasm" (293). From the self to the state to a sovereign God: it appears that we are moving up levels on the totem pole of the phantasm. And yet it seems that, in Derrida, the theo- logical principle of sovereignty is at work already in the phantasms of the nation-state if not, perhaps, already in the self. For the principle or phantasm of sovereignty is, in the end, always haunted by the phantasm of a divine sovereignty at the heart of polit- ical power, not only as it once was found in the monarch but in modern democracies in the form of the people - which is held, like every sovereign, to be inviolable and indivisible. Derrida writes: "I continue to believe that the theological filiation of sov- ereignty remains even there where one speaks of popular freedom and self-determi- nation" ( Unconditionality 60). "All 'bellicose' state-nationalisms are the result of this filiation" (62). Derridas prescriptive message in Unconditionality or Sovereignty and many sim- ilar texts, including Rogues, is, it seems, pretty clear: we must continue the "decon- struction in progress of sovereignism, of the phantasms of political theology." We must continue - through what looks like a kind of sovereignty, a kind of power and freedom - to help with the deconstruction in progress, a deconstruction that is hap- pening in spite of or through us and thus beyond all sovereignty ( Unconditionality 52). New forms of shared or limited sovereignty must thus be found at the same time as we try to think an unconditionality without sovereignty and, thus, without power and without phantasm. The counter-sovereignty of the university must then, through an appeal to the unconditional and therefore powerless freedom of thought, question the phantasm of sovereignty and, first of all, the phantasm of sovereignty's indivisi- bility. Derrida writes in "The University Without Condition": "It would be necessary to dissociate a certain unconditional independence of thought, of deconstruction, of justice, of the Humanities, of the University, and so forth, from any phantasm of indi- visible sovereignty and sovereign mastery" (235). The phantasm needs to be exposed and denounced not because it is untrue, false, or merely apparent, but because it is so powerful and because it threatens the very freedom that makes it possible. Derrida writes again in Unconditionality and Sovereignty: "The unconditionality of thought must put into question, in the name of freedom itself, the principle of sovereignty as a principle of power" (62). Hence, Derrida opposes the power of sovereignty to an "unconditionality without sovereignty," to a "freedom without power" but not with- out "force" (64). Only such a force, such a "weak force," will allow one to resist, says Derrida, the "laws of the city," the phantasm, we might say, of the city's sovereignty, as</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) well as the temptation to turn this critical force into a new power and, thus, a new phantasm of sovereignty. The weak, unconditional force of the university must thus not allow itself to be transformed into or taken for a new power; it must organize its resistance to sovereign power without becoming itself just one more reactive, sover- eign power. Hence, the university must not, writes Derrida, "enclose itself and recon- stitute the abstract phantasm of sovereignty, whose theological or humanist heritage it will perhaps have begun to deconstruct"; it must instead ally itself "with extra-aca- demic forces, in order to organize an inventive resistance [. . .] to all attempts at reap- propriation [. . .] to all the other figures of sovereignty" ("University" 236). But here is perhaps another trait of the phantasm. In resisting different kinds of sovereign power both inside and outside the university, the weak force of thought must not become another reactive sovereign power, or, rather, must not become another power in general since all power is, it seems, reactive. To return to our reading of Speech and Phenomena, the phenomenon of the phantasm was, in some sense, a reaction to the phantasm as phenonomon , to the fact that différance, iterability - indeed spectrality - is the condition of all hearing oneself speak. The phantasm is not simply conditioned by spectrality but is a reaction to it, a reaction to an original disappropriation, to an original non-identity to self that happens first of all through the giving of language to the self by the other. Speaking in his last published interview, entitled Learning to Live Finally ; of his own history as he tells it in Monolingualism of the Other ; Derrida says: "I have only one language, and, at the same time, in an at once singular and exemplary fashion, this language does not belong to me. I explain this better in Monolingualism of the Other. A singular history has exacerbated in me this universal law: a language is not something that belongs. Not naturally and in its essence. Whence the phantasms of property, appropriation, and colonialist imposition" (n.p.).5 The phantasm would thus be a reaction , a phenomenological reaction, to an originary spectrality. It should thus come as no surprise that an originary contamination of presence or impurity of roots would lead to the reactive phantasms of purity at the level of ethnicity or the nation- state. Indeed, as Derrida demonstrated in many texts and in his seminars on "Philosophical Nationalisms," phantasms of the nation-state often involve claims about purity, health, or salvation, along with related calls to purge, heal, or save the state from an offending or dangerous invasion. Derrida spoke, to give just a single example, in 1993 of the way in which Jean-Marie Le Pen, as head of the right-wing party the Front National frequently evoked the "quasi-biological image of the health of the nation's body" in order to speak of the threats posed to the French nation by immigration. As Derrida remarks, "the nationalist phantasm, as with its politicking rhetoric, often passes by way of these organicist analogies" ("Deconstruction" 102).</page><page sequence="11">Michael Naas 11 As a critique "of the phantasm or of the axiom of purity," deconstruction would call into question such organicist analogies, such attempts to purify the body politic by purging it of what threatens its putatively natural health and integrity. In his pref- ace to Alain David's Racisme et antisémitisme , Derrida speaks in this way of the origins of racism and anti-Semitism: "There where, beyond the artifact, there is no race in and of itself, no 'the Semite' or 'the Jew,' how can one speak of racism or anti-Semitism without taking seriously the effects of the artifact, of the phantasm, of the imaginary - and, before all else, of affect?" ("La forme" 24). 6 Anti-Semitism would thus be born of the phantasm, an artifact that - through a certain fascination - has "real" effects and powerful affects. But in this preface Derrida goes even further, relating a fascination for form not simply to the phantasm of race but to nothing less than the fascination for an organ- izing form, for an eidos, and thus to the very impulse of a metaphysics of presence. Derrida speaks of a "fascination for form, that is, for the visibility of a certain organ- ic or organizing contour, an eidos , if you will, and thus an idealization, an idealism as that which institutes philosophy itself, philosophy or metaphysics as such" (10). It is as if metaphysics itself, then, were a reaction to an original deformation of form, quite literally a reactive formation that transforms an original spectrality where presence is determined by absence and difference into what is assumed to be an original and non- contaminated presence. Metaphysics would be a reactive formation whose entire work would be the production of phantasms of form, form as phantasm and as fasci- nation. The phantasm as such, then, would be the phantasm of the "as such " of form. Though Derrida does not state it in precisely this way, it would seem from what he has argued that deconstruction is always a deconstruction of the phantasm. While the phantasm is, on the one hand, continuous with other terms in Derrida's work such as the phantom, the ghost, and the specter, it appears to be a particularly pow- erful or tenacious form of metaphysical phenomenality, that is, a phenomenality that attempts to conceal or repress the iterability of the phenomenon in order to give rise to a "phenomenon" that goes beyond the phenomena, a vouloir dire that would pre- cede and exceed all phenomenal expression, that would even exceed, as we will see, all life. Though the deconstruction of a metaphysics of the phantasm demonstrates that the phantasm does not, metaphysically speaking, exist or exist beyond its appearance, it is perpetually resurrected because of this non-existence, because of its promise of a life beyond the phenomenon of life, a beyond of immanence, perhaps, in the sense that Len Lawlor has been developing this notion in a couple of recent works (see, for example, The Implications of Immanence). This tendency of the phantasm to promise a beyond of the phenomenon and a</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) beyond of life can be seen in an exemplary fashion in "Faith and Knowledge," one of Derrida's most fascinating, important, and challenging texts of the 1990s. The phan- tasm there plays a role on a number of levels in Derrida's investigation of the relation- ship between religion and science - a relationship that is arguably even more crucial today than it was a decade ago to our geopolitical situation because, it seems, the phan- tasm in general simply will not go away. But before turning to this essential text, let me briefly review the characteristics we have already seen attached to the phantasm. First, the phantasm involves the coincidence or the assumed coincidence of the self with itself, a self that would be, then, indivisible and, ultimately, inviolable. This self- coincidence or self-identity, what Derrida called in several later texts "ipseity," leads to the phantasm of a self-same self that can act, that has power, in a word, that is sover- eign - a second characteristic of the phantasm. The phantasm is thus always a phan- tasm of power and power - as opposed to force - is always a phantasm. Third, the phantasm of sovereignty tends to present itself as natural or as organic, as excluding the machine or the artifact, even if, as Derrida shows, it is always the effect of an artifact. It thus always presents itself as pure or as a call to purity. Fourth, and this is a related point, the phantasm, though always historically conditioned, linguistically coded, appears as ahistorical and non-linguistic, as having a non-conventional origin. The phantasm thus tends - a fifth characteristic - to try to pass off what is always a historically conditioned performative fiction as a constative or objective observation. The power of sovereignty lies precisely in this elision of a fictional origin and its real effects, the elision of a per- formative fiction (an "as if," a comme si) and a constative observation (an "as this" or a "like that," a comme ça). From comme si to comme ça: that is the movement of every sov- ereign fiction and the constitution of every sovereign power. It is in the nature of the phantasm that it not appear as what it "is," that this projection appears natural or in nature, that the comme si of the phantasm be conflated with a comme ça.7 Though not all fictions become sovereign, all sovereignties are fictions or phan- tasms. This is, I think, the central lesson of Derrida's essay on the "Declaration of Independence," where a performative or prescriptive ought is shown to be conflated or elided with a constative is or are in the crucial phrase "there states are and ought to be free and independent states" ("Declarations" 46-54). That fiction or fable or phantasm is at the origin of political power is also the central lesson of an essay such as "Force of Law" - a phrase, "force of law," that in and of itself gives voice to this conflation or eli- sion of nomos and physis, the speech act or, as Derrida liked to put it, the juridical per- formative of law, and the illocutionary and perlocutionary effects of that law.8 Sixth and finally, the phantasm as artifact cannot be confused with a fallen, inferior, or mimetic image of the truth; it is not to be understood simply in terms of truth and</page><page sequence="13">Michael Naas 1 3 falsity, or image and reality, but in terms of power and affect. Even more, the power of the phantasm comes precisely from the way in which the "subjective" projection of a putatively pure, original, or pre-original sovereign is seen, read, or understood as an "objective" reality, as a kind of truth. While the phantasm is not true, it is not enough to say that it is simply false, for it presents to us not the way things are or are not but, like a Freudian illusion, the way we would wish them to be and, thus, the way we then take them to be. The phantasm, thus, cannot be dispelled simply by pointing out the truth, since this notion of truth as objectively determined and independent of me is one of the effects of the phantasm. In "Faith and Knowledge," a couple more important traits are added to the above list. First, the phantasm - the result, as always, of the machine and the artifact - promises to offer a surplus or abundance of life, a life beyond both life and death, a life beyond the mechanisms of life and beyond the machine. In this respect, the phantasm will be something like the metaphysical shadow of Derrida's concept of living on, one of the reasons, I would suggest, why Derrida retained it, since by never shaking com- pletely free of its metaphysical double the Derridean phantasm exerts a critical force against this powerful metaphysical phantasm. While the phantasm promises a life beyond life, a pure life without technique or the machine, a life beyond history and time, a life that can no longer be separated from a certain death drive, or a certain conception of the death drive, the concept of living on or of survival acknowledges history and convention and promises an intensification of life, a life in death, but never any immortality. Finally, the phantasm in "Faith and Knowledge" appears to be a decidedly "masculine" formation, even if, obviously, it is not simply the phantasm of men. It is phantasm that helps explain both violence against women, according to Derrida, and - through this violence or through the exclusion of women - their phantasmatic and symptomatic return through phantasms of purity, inviolability, and superabundant life. In nurtured "Faith and by religion Knowledge," for the Derrida safe and argues sound, that the an immune, absolute for respect a life that for life, goes a beyond respect nurtured by religion for the safe and sound, the immune, for a life that goes beyond life, is not unrelated to the mechanisms of death, to repetition, iterability, virtuality, and teletechnology. Indeed, such an absolute respect for life is actually pursued through this virtuality and teletechnology, that is, through the very things that threaten the purity, sanctity, and indemnity of life. Hence, religion is, as Derrida puts it, autoimmune, the pursuit of an indemnified life that is always pursued by means of that which compromises such life. Today's religious "manifestations" of the Pope or of religious fundamentalists or other groups would be impossible without an appropriation of</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) teletechnoscience, a science that is then eschewed in the name, precisely, of life. While this autoimmune appropriation of digital culture and cyberspace appears new and is most certainly taking place at an unprecedented rate today, religion has never done without it. As Derrida succinctly puts it, "the ether of religion will have always been hospitable to a certain spectral virtuality" (70nl7), a spectral virtuality, Derrida will go on to show, that is put in the service of a hyperbolization of the value of life. That is why religion appears always related to questions of health and salvation, to a restoration of health, a healing of the sick and a reconstitution of the healthy body - to what might be characterized as a phantasmatic immunity, a self or state that appears and wishes itself to be indemnified, safe and sound, but that is, in fact, always open to a spectral autoimmunity. Now, at the same time that Derrida's text speaks clearly and forcefully about this autoimmunity, it also enacts it, for in the midst of a discussion between Derrida and other European men on the subject of religion, in a discussion of religion that has - and this was not Derrida's choice - excluded women, Derrida will let two phantasmat- ic figures of the feminine appear in his text, as if to demonstrate that when women are excluded they tend to return - as phantasms. These two figures, one Greek and one Roman, Persephone and Gradiva, would need to be read in conjunction with a third figure, that is, with Khôra , whom Derrida treats explicitly and in great detail in this text since Khôra is that which or the one who, while opening up the space for all phantasm, for the phenomena of the phantasm, constantly eludes and interrupts the phantasm of phenomena, including every anthropomorphic or theological phantasm. It is in the context, then, of religion's attempt to indemnify life through the teletechnological machine that Derrida first uses the word phantasm in "Faith and Knowledge" - and uses it, as in Speech and Phenomenay in reference to a certain repres- sion. Speaking of how the stakes of today's "cyberspatialized or cyberspaced wars of reli- gion" have been repressed, "dissimulated or displaced," Derrida claims that this repres- sion "never occurs without symptoms and fantasies [phantasmes], without specters (phantasmata) to be investigated" ("Faith" 24). This is the first clue, it seems to me, about how we are to interpret the later appearance of Gradiva in Derrida's text, Gradiva who is not only explicitly called a phantasm or illusion and a symptom in Freud's famous text but whose name in psychoanalysis is almost synonymous for repressed desire that surfaces as a phantasm and symptom - as the male delusion that results from a repression of women or, perhaps, from the transformation of sexual difference into sexual opposition. For, as we know from Freud, repression leads not to effacement but displacement, to the transformation of desire into dreams, into art, into religion, or into delusions or phantasms to be read as the symptoms - as the reactions - to desire.</page><page sequence="15">Michael Naas 1 5 A second clue to understanding the appearance of Gradiva in "Faith and Know- ledge" can be found in section 39, where Derrida continues his argument about the double origin or source of religion, namely, faith and belief, revealability and revelation, along with the originary faith that is at the origin of both religion and science. Derrida marshals all his arguments together in this section in order to explain an ultimate phan- tasm in religion, what he calls the phallus effect - at once the phenomenality, the phainesthai, of the phallus and, because of the law of iterability, its detachment from its own pure, proper presence. The phallus is, in essence, detachable, its own phantasm, double, specter, or fetish, a supplement or artifact that comes after the original but presents itself as coming before , as having greater value, greater power, as having - as we will see with Gradiva - a surplus of life, a capacity to live on after life and in defi- ance of death. The phallus, as opposed to the penis, thus brings together life and the machine; it is the technical supplement or detachable marionette that presents itself as that which is most productive of life and most able to protect or indemnify life. It is that which, through the colossal automaticity of erection, promises a maximum of life through an automatic reflexivity that runs counter to that life. The phallus is a virtuality that appears to bring together the calculable and the incalculable, putting the calculability of teletechnoscience into relation with the incal- culable source of religion in a life beyond life. Derrida speaks of "faith in the most liv- ing as dead and automatically sur-vivingy resuscitated in its spectral phantasma, the holy, safe and sound, unscathed, the immune, sacred [. . .] the spectral fantasy [phan- tasme spectral] of the dead as the principle of life and of sur- vivai [sur-vie]. This mechanical principle is apparently very simple: life has absolute value only if it is worth more than life" (48, 50). Everything Derrida goes on to say about sacrifice and circumcision can be related to this movement: the penis is transformed, resuscitated, automatically raised up into the phallus through the circumcisional cut, the unde- tachable organ being thereby transformed into the detachable fetish, a respect for life transformed into a vocation to sacrifice. While this vocation to sacrifice, this "princi- ple of sacrificial self-destruction," this auto-immunity that opens the community to contamination and to a compromising of its self-protection, is always carried out "in view of some sort of invisible and spectral sur- vivai," this survival wavers between an openness to "something other and more than itself: the other, the future, death, free- dom, the coming or the love of the other, the space and time of a specializing mes- sianicity beyond all messianism," and, I would like to emphasize, all that and more , namely, the hyperbolic phantasm - the absolute phantasm - of an absolute life or a pure life, the phantasm of a life beyond life (50-51).</page><page sequence="16">16 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007 ) Now, it is just after this invocation of the phallus as phantasm or fetish, this invoca- tion of what we might call a "masculine" phantasm, that Derrida turns, almost automat- ically, to what might be called a "feminine" phantasm or a phantasm of the feminine. He goes on to argue that the force of life, the swelling of life, the automaticity that can be transformed into a fetish, can be related to the spontaneity of erection or, indeed, of pregnancy. Derrida then appends at precisely this point a long footnote on Beneveniste, who relates the Greek kurios - meaning sovereign - to the sacred and to its origin in the word kuien, meaning to grow or "to swell." The identification we have seen from the beginning between the phantasm and sovereignty is here confirmed, but this time on the side of the mother as well as the father. The sacred or the holy is related not just to sovereign power but to an exuberant, fecund force capable of bringing to Ufe in a spontaneous and automatic way. The phallus effect or the fecund belly rises up of its own accord, self-seeding and self-bearing - like an Immaculate Conception. It is just after this note, which is just after the reference to the phantasm and the fetish, to the supplemental cut that attempts to restore the original indemnified state, that Derrida asks why the privileged victims of ethico-religious violence are so often women, and often by rape and mutilation. Derrida's answer to this question becomes clear in what follows: violence against women and the sacralization and protection, the indemnification, of them, go hand in hand. When real women are forgotten or excluded, their phantoms emerge, their purity made into the object of fetishized desire. When life or life-death is forgotten, when the relationship between life and the technical sup- plement is forgotten or repressed, life or life-death becomes replaced by a hyper- bolization of life, the colossal phallus or the spontaneously swollen, pregnant belly. In an autoimmune reaction to the uprooting or deracination of the phallus effect, to the move beyond life into living on through media and technology, one turns against this deracination by turning against the living, proper body. Hence, Derrida, in section 42, argues that todays "religious wars" - and Derrida was no doubt thinking of what was going on in the former Yugoslavia at the time - have two ages, and thus two forms of violence: one contemporary, which makes use of hyper-sophisticated military tele- technology, digital culture, and the other a new archaic violence. This second, archaic violence thus takes revenge on the first violence through the teletechnological means of the first - an archaic violence that, as Derrida analyzed the destruction of the World Trade Towers on 9/11, feeds on the techno-science it turns against. Indeed Derrida speaks in the 9/11 interview of the "phantasms - both conscious and unconscious - of those who decided and then put into action, in their heads and in their airplanes, right up to suicide, the slashing open and collapse of this double tower": "Archaic and forever puerile, terribly childish, these masculine phantasms were in fact fed by an</page><page sequence="17">Michael Naas 1 7 entire techno-cinematographic culture, and not only the genre of science fiction" ("Autoimmunity" 187n6). In an autoimmune reaction, the second, archaic violence thus turns against the first in order to return, says Derrida in "Faith and Knowledge," to the living, proper body - or, rather, says Derrida, to its phantasm (52). By turning against the expropri- ating, decorporalizing machine, one turns to the bare hand: to decapitation, to the mutilation of both women and men, to rape, to the exposure of bodies, and all this - and even when it is recorded, filmed, and distributed by teletechnology - in order to return to the phantasm of the living body. When the relationship between the proper body and the machine, another name for death, is forgotten, the living body tends to return as phantasm , as a body that offers a surplus of life, a phenomenon of the phan- tasm that promises a beyond of the phenomenon. I said above that it is not only Gradiva who is invoked in "Faith and Knowledge" but Persephone, the figure who is so central to "Tympan," or so central at least to the right hand column of that text, though also, as Tom Dutoit has argued in the recent issue of Mosaic we are celebrating here, to many other Derrida texts.9 A symbol of vio- lence against women because of her rape by Hades, a symbol of both life and death, fertility and barrenness, insofar as she divides her time between Hades and earth, Persephone is evoked by Derrida without being explicitly named in two places in "Faith and Knowledge." In both cases, it is a single word that raises her specter, a word that is almost a synecdoche for her: that word is "pomegranates." In the final lines of section 51, the next to last section of this great text on religion, Derrida writes: "Ontotheology encrypts faith and destines it to the condition of a sort of Spanish Marrano who would have lost - in truth, dispersed, multiplied - everything up to and including the memory of his unique secret. Emblem of a still life [nature morte]: an opened pomegranate [la grenade entamée ], one Easter [Pâques: Passover] evening, on a tray" (66). With almost nothing to contextualize this line, the secret of what seems to be a memory for Jacques Derrida risks being, after his death, forever forgotten, definitively lost. And yet this word "pomegranate" or, in French, grenade, can still be read, its semantic kernel split open, both in the passage I just read and, some 15 sec- tions earlier in "Faith and Knowledge," between sections 37 and 38, where Derrida once again drops this word without context and without warning to introduce the remaining sections of the text. After section 37, Derrida thus writes in French "et grenades" and then comments: "(Having posed these premises or general definitions, and given the diminishing space available, we shall cast [satellisons] the fifteen final propositions in a form that is even more granulated [égrenée], grainy [grenadée], dis- seminated, aphoristic, discontinuous, juxtapositional, dogmatic, indicative or virtual,</page><page sequence="18">18 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007) economic; in a word, more then ever telegraphic.)" (47). While the latter context jus- tifies the translation of grenades by "pomegranates," its context here, in the midst of a text on religion and science, faith and violence, is not so determined as to exclude the other meaning of grenades in French, namely, "grenades." Indeed, Derrida appears to have lobbed this word into the middle of the fifty-two sections of "Faith and Knowledge" in order to gather or, rather, disperse many of the themes of the phantasm we have been following throughout this essay, in order to evoke all the tensions between, precisely, faith and knowledge, nature and culture, the pomegranate of reli- gion and the grenade of techno-science, a symbol of female fertility, of life-giving seed, on the one hand, and an image of masculine violence, of shrapnel casting death, on the other, the blood-red pomegranate of Persephone and the army-green hand-held machine of technoscience.10 Et grenades: this would appear to be the perfect still life, the perfect nature morte, a life that is always already opened, compromised, exposed, entamée. If the phantasm is always the reaction of form and meaning to a deforma- tion of form and an ambivalence that exceeds controllable meaning, then it just might be that the first form of the phantasm in "Faith and Knowledge" is the belief that we can handle this word grenade, this techno-religious pharmakon, so as to turn it in one direction or another, disarm its ambivalence by reducing it to polysemy, and turn its fundamental difference into a system of oppositions (male-female, death-life, technē- physis, and so on).11 It is in precisely this context, with these values in the background, that I would like to read the phantasmatic appearance of yet another figure in "Faith and Knowledge," one who is much more explicitly evoked than Persephone and so less liable to be the object of my own hermeneutic phantasms. That figure is Gradiva, the delusion or phan- tasm of Wilhelm Jensen's archaeologist in the novella "Gradiva: A Pompeiian Fancy," to which Freud devotes a close reading in Delusion and Dream [Der Wahn und die Traiime]. The reason for Gradiva's appearance in "Faith and Knowledge" (38, 66) is in some sense determined by the context, namely, a meeting in February 1994 on the island of Capri, so close to Pompeii, indeed within eyeshot of it, that brought together a number of thinkers, all European, or at least all Judeo-Christian, and all men, to dis- cuss religion. Derrida thus recalls in section 5 of "Faith and Knowledge," "not a single woman!" just after remarking "No Muslim is among us, alas," and just before recalling that one of the reasons for the meeting in the first place was everything "that is hastily grouped under the reference to 'Islam,"' which seems "today to retain some sort of geopolitical or global prerogative, as a result of the nature of its physical violences, of certain of its declared violations of the democratic model and of international law" (5). No Muslims and no women, then, in a dialogue about religion. It is as if Derrida</page><page sequence="19">Michael Naas 19 wished to remind us that when women are forgotten in the context of religion, or when, in religion, they are exalted beyond life, they tend to return - like Gradiva - as symp- toms, as delusions or phantasms to replace living women. That is why, I would like to believe, Derrida refers to Khôra, to Persephone, to Gradiva, and, perhaps especially, to the unnamed women who are, says Derrida, the privileged victims of religious violence. What is repressed, to use the word we've been tracking since Speech and Phenomena , pushed into the unconscious or into the underworld, returns - as phantom, as delu- sion, as symptom. With no women present in Capri, what Derrida makes a place for in his discourse are not the voices of absent women, as if he could speak for them - since that would be the worst phantasm - but, instead, female figures of male phantasm, Gradiva being first among these as the phantasm of a Ufe in excess of life, the phantasm of a life resurrected from the ashes of Vesuvius. Yes, life: for in the story of Gradiva by Wilhelm Jensen and interpreted by Freud it is precisely life in the form of Zoe Bertgang that is forgotten, life that is abandoned, repressed by the protagonist archaeologist, so that what takes its or her place in this repression, through this repression, is the dangerous delusion or phantasm of a woman who would seem to go beyond life, beyond Zoe, in the figure of the once ashen and dead but now ivory-cheeked and resurrected Gradiva. Overcoming death and time, this phantasm holds us in its power, in its spell, and risks destroying us with the illusion of an exuberance and a life purely present to itself, a proper body that goes beyond life and death, endlessly resuscitated or resurrected, immaculately conceived at midday from the ashes of Pompeii. Though there is no reading of Freud's Gradiva essay in "Faith and Knowledge," everything Derrida writes about violence and women in relation to the phantasm seems to support this view.12 Again, the phantasm is not an error to be measured in relation to truth; it is not some imitation, image, or representation to be measured against the real, but is akin to what Freud in The Future of an Illusion and elsewhere terms an "illusion." Not a rep- resentation or misrepresentation of the way things are but a projection on the part of a subject or nation-state of the way one would wish them to be - and, thus, in some sense, the way they become, with all their real, attendant effects.13 "Faith and Know- ledge" thus speaks explicitly of the phantasms - the sovereign phantasms - of the phallus and the inviolable mother as source of all life and it brings these phantasms on the scene in a more discreet way, male phantasms of women and then, in the case of Khôra , the figure of what resists all figuration and all phantasm. From tasm Speech comes and to light: Phenomena the phantasm to Learning is what to Live always Finally, presents a certain itself as figure emanating of the phan- from tasm comes to light: the phantasm is what always presents itself as emanating from</page><page sequence="20">20 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007) a self coincident with itself, an ipseity with power, that is supported through metaphors of the natural and the organic, that, in its sovereignty, offers a life beyond life, a con- flation of the technical and the natural, a spontaneous and automatic growth and abundance in the form of either the phallus or the swollen belly, and so, in the end, the phantasm of either a father or a mother who can generate all by itself through an Immaculate Conception. It is time, since I am close to the end, to deploy what has been for me an almost failsafe hermeneutic principle when trying to check any hypoth- esis or thesis regarding the work of Jacques Derrida. The principle runs something like this: make your case by ranging widely throughout Derrida's corpus, from early to later texts; for example, in trying to understand the nature of phantasm, piece together remarks in texts as different as Speech and Phenomena, Monolingualism of the Other, "Faith and Knowledge," "Ulysses Gramophone," and so on, but then turn at the end to Glas to see whether the whole thing was not already laid out for you, from start to fin- ish, in 1974. Once again, this principle will not have failed me. Though it is impossible to do justice here to the development of the phantasm in this work, it is equally impossible to ignore the way Derrida's reading of the phantasm in relation to Hegel confirms each and every one of the moves we have followed. Let me take just a moment to demonstrate this. As we have seen, the phantasm is related to a self-coincidence or self-possession, to what Derrida calls ipseity. We read in Glas, "that" - ça, a little word that is written like the ça of comme ça but is pronounced like Sa, Savoir Absolu, or absolute knowl- edge - "That (ça) is called a colossal compensation. The absolute phantasm as an absolute self-having [s'avoir absolu]" (198bi). So much for self-possession or self- coincidence; as for this self-possession or self-identity being not originary but, as we have seen, already a reaction, Derrida in Glas relates the phantasm to the formation and reaction of a system of oppositions to an original difference. "As soon as the dif- ference is determined as opposition, no longer can the phantasm (a word to be deter- mined) of the IC be avoided: to wit, a phantasm of infinite mastery of the two sides of the oppositional relation." This mastery is nothing less, as we saw, than the history of metaphysics as the reduction of all ambivalence to polysemy, all deformation to form and figure, all difference to opposition, oppositions that "have as cause and effect the immaculate maintenance of each of the terms, their independence, and con- sequently their absolute mastery. Absolute mastery that they see conferred on them- selves phantasmatically the very moment they are reversed and subordinated" (223a). This determination of difference as opposition then appears to give rise, as the reference to the Immaculate Conception makes clear, to phantasms of purity and to</page><page sequence="21">Michael Naas 2 1 the opposition - the opposition as opposed to the difference - between the sexes, that is, to the opposition between two sexes that can now generate on their own, sponta- neously, automatically, like the erect phallus or the swollen belly. "The virgin-mother does without the actual father, both in order to come and to conceive" (223a). And then: "phantasmatic would be the effect of mastery produced by the determination of difference as opposition (and up to the value of mastery itself), of sexual difference as sexual opposition in which each term would secure itself the domination and absolute autonomy in the IC: the effect - the son (rather than the daughter) comes back to me all by myself" (224a). This, recall, was already the phantasm of narcissism, the phan- tasm of a narcissism that is always undone by its phenomenon. As we have also seen throughout, it is precisely the phantasm as phenomenon that checks the power of the phenomenon of the phantasm - and so it is in Glas. "The check of such a desire of the return to self, or the circle of double virginity, that would be the limit of the phantasm [...]. The phantasm is the phenomenon. The names indicate this." And yet, as we have also seen, it is the nature of the sovereign phantasm to tend toward hyperbole, that is, toward the absolute phantasm - and, in Glas , toward the phantasm of the absolute. Once the phantasm is thus seen not simply in terms of truth and reality but power and affect, indeed as that which produces the truth, it is difficult to see what could possibly check it. Derrida asks in Glas: "In front of what would the phantasm of the IC have failed? In front of 'reality'? [. . .] Who would dare say that the phantasm of the IC has not succeeded? Two thousand years, at least, of Europe, from Christ to Sa" (224a). Yes, from Christ to Sa, from Christ to savoir absolu or absolute knowledge: in Derrida's reading of Hegel in Glas, the phantasm moves not just from comme si to comme ça but to ç a, to Say an absolute phantasm that would risk having no check at all were it not for the fact, perhaps, that ça and 5a, homophones differently written, are enough to suggest that expression will always compromise the self-possession of a vouloir dire. "Will it be said, to determine the IC as phantasm, that the IC is not true, that that (ça) does not happen like that (comme ça), that this is only a myth? That would indeed be silly [. . .] the (absolute) phantasm of the IC as (absolute) phantasm is (absolute) truth. Truth is the phantasm itself" (224a).14 The phantasm is indeed produced in the move from comme si to comme ça, from the performative fiction of writing to the phantasm of hearing oneself speak like that. From comme si to comme ça and then ultimately to 5a as savoir absolu : "5a is the final accomplishment of the phantasm: Sa. But do not conclude from this: Sa, that is nothing but - the phantasm [...]. No longer can it be said of an infinite phantasm that it is nothing but. Says dis- course disqualifies the nothing-buť (224a-225a). If deconstruction is always a deconstruction of the phantasm, then it must take</page><page sequence="22">22 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007) on both the father and the mother without opposition; it must tender the hypothesis that not only the father but the mother - the seemingly natural, organic mother, the one who conceives and gives birth beyond phenomena and beyond every speech act - is also a legal fiction, the result of a comme si that always tends toward a comme ça. The phantasm of the mother after the father, the phantasm of an Immaculate Conception - that would be, in the end, something like the ultimate phantasm. It is worth recalling in this regard, as a way of concluding, Derrida's preface to Jacques Trilling's book James Joyce ou l'écriture matricide , where Derrida recalls yet again Joyce's famous line concerning paternity as a legal fiction, paternity, we might say, as a phantasm, in order, this time, to apply it to the mother. For Derrida argues in this preface that we must go beyond the "commonplace" view, shared by Joyce, Freud, and others, that while the father is always the result of inference, speculation, calcula- tion, and so on, the mother is not since we can see the mother give birth with our own two eyes. In an age of frozen embryos, in vitro fertilization, and surrogate mother- hood, we must today acknowledge, argues Derrida, what has in fact always been the case: the mother, like the father, is subject to "substitution, rational inference, phan- tasmatic or symbolic construction, speculation, and so on." In a word, the mother, like the father, is a legal fiction that risks becoming a sovereign phantasm, a legitimate phantasm and a phantasm of legitimation. Arguing, in effect, that this evidence of the eyes has never been trustworthy, that, to cite the end of Speech and Phenomena , "the eye and the world [are] within language," Derrida writes in the preface to Trilling's book on Joyce: If today the unicity of the mother is no longer the sensible object of a perceptual certitude, if maternities can no longer be reduced to, indeed if they carry us beyond, the carrying mother, if there can be, in a word, more than one mother, if "the" mother is the object of calculation and supposition, of projection and phantasm, if the "womb" is no longer out- side all phantasm, the assured place of birth, this "new" situation simply illuminates in return an ageless truth. The mother was never only, never uniquely, never indubitably the one who gives birth - and whom one sees, with one's own eyes, give birth [. . .] The mother is also a speculative object and even a "legal fiction." ("La Veilleuse" n.p.) 15 Subject to phantasm, the mother, then, is not natural but inscribed in history, in con- ventions, subject to symbolization, speculation, and replacement. Once again, the mother as phenomenon compromises the phenomenon of the mother as phantasm, that is, as an essentially "masculine" phantasm, the mother as unique, natural, organic, sovereign, beyond history, the source of a life beyond life, a divinity, the source of a priceless dignity of life, a life to be sacrificed, then, in the name of what goes beyond</page><page sequence="23">Michael Naas 23 it. It is this phantasm that deconstruction calls into question so as to think not exactly the mother but, perhaps, maternity - another name, here, for the event - anew, mater- nity without sovereignty and thus without phantasm, if such a thing were possible. I would like to believe that that is what Derrida was suggesting in the movie Derrida by Amy Kofman and Kirby Dick when he refused to name a philosopher who would have been his mother. The question, you might recall, is asked by a male voice off-screen, "if you had a choice, what philosopher would you like to be your mother?" Obviously amused and intrigued by the question, Derrida says after a very long pause that he could not have a philosopher as a mother because, for him, philosophy, the phi- losophy he has tried to deconstruct, is a phallogocentric enterprise whose figures are always masculine and paternal - an enterprise, I think we could say, of phantasmatic fathers whose phantasms Derrida tried always and everywhere to expose. Were he to have a mother, he says, it could not be a philosopher but - since he distinguishes between these - a thinker, and it would not be someone from the past but from the future, someone post-deconstructive - his son, he first suggests, or else his grand- daughter. Turning us toward the future of thought rather than toward some phantasm of the past, he says, finally, "my mother as philosopher would be my granddaughter." It is, I believe, in this direction that we must turn in following Derrida today, though it is hard not to wonder whether we are able to do so without phantasm, without some him or her, without even the "phantasm of a signature" ("Ulysses" 304). NOTES 1/ See Derrida's comments about a similar situation in "As if I were Dead: An Interview with Jacques Derrida," 212-26. 2/ Though I do not believe that the notion of the "phantasm" can be completely separated from its others, from its "doubles," such as phantom, specter, ghost, and so on, I would be tempted to say that while these latter tend to emphasize iterability, otherness, dissemination, difference, and so on, the former tends - though this tendency is always frustrated - to emphasize uniqueness, sameness, self-generation, identity, and so on. 3/ "But is not the desire for a center, as a function of play itself, the indestructible itself? And in the repeti- tion or return of play, how could the phantom of the center not call to us? ("Ellipsis" 297). 4/ DeArmitt does this in her as yet unpublished dissertation at DePaul University, Echoes of Narcissus. 5/ The interview, Learning to Live Finally, translated by Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, is forth- coming from Hoboken, NJ: Melville House. 6/ In "Abraham, the Other," Derrida says that in order to speak of "the Jew," of the name "Jew" or "Jewish," one would need the "art or genius for an archeology of the phantasm, the courage of a child as well" (in Judéités [Paris: Editions Galilée, 2003], 20). 7/ In Taking on the Tradition, I tried to demonstrate that the tradition is always, m effect, the effect of its reception, of a comme si that tries to pass itself off as a comme ça. Though I did not put it this way at the time, it could be said that the tradition itself, taken as something determined and fixed, inviolable and inalienable, safe and sound in its original intent, is itself a phantasm.</page><page sequence="24">24 Mosaic 40/2 (June 2007) 8/ Derrida writes in Sovereignties in Question: "If I insist so much on the fable and the fabulous, it is no doubt and too evidently because of fables, like those of La Fontaine, that politically or anthropomorphically stage animals who play a role in civil society or in the State, often the statutory roles of the subject or the sovereign. But there is another reason for my insistence on the fabulous. It is because, as the fables them- selves show, political force or power, in laying down the law, in laying down its own law, in appropriating legitimate violence and legitimating its own arbitrary violence, is in essence such that this unleashing and restraining of power passes by way of the fable, in other words, by way of a language that is both fictional and performative. [. . .] In the fable, within a narrative that is itself fabulous, power is shown to be an effect of the fable, of fiction and fictive language, of the simulacrum. Just like the law, like the force of law, which Montaigne and Pascal said is, in essence, fictional" (109). The fiction or phantasm of the sovereign as a "living law," as at once inside and outside the law, as Agamben has demonstrated, would thus be yet another figure for the theologico-political phantasm. 9/ See Dutoit's "Mythic Derrida" in Mosaic 39.3 (Sept 2006): 103-32 as well as his "Upearthing the Field of English Studies: Discoursing Pensées in Jacques Derrida" in European Journal of English Studies 6.3 (2002): 327-42. 10/ The pomegranate is an important image for Greek, Christian, and Jewish culture and, perhaps espe- cially, for Sephardic Jews, who, living in the Mediterranean, often use the pomegranate during Passover and other religious celebrations. 1 1/ "If one translates 'all-powerfulness' by sovereignty, or rather by the phantasm of sovereignty, one will conclude from this that the dénégation of sexual difference is part of the program of sovereignty itself, of sovereignty in general" (in "La Veilleuse," Derrida's preface to Jacques Trilling's James Joyce ou l'écriture matricide, 17. The translation of Pascale- Anne Brault and Michael Naas is forthcoming in James Joyce Quarterly). 12/ Gradiva's appearance in "Faith and Knowledge" is, of course, not her only one in Derrida's corpus. In Archive Fever, trans. Eric Prenowitz (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1996), written during almost exactly the same time period as "Faith and Knowledge," Derrida looks not only at Freud's analyses of the phantasm in the Gradiva essay and elsewhere but at Freud's own belief in phantasms and his attempt to conjure them away, his belief in his ability to conjure them up so as to conjure them away. Though I cannot do this here, it would be interesting to relate everything argued below about Gradiva as a male phantasm to the phan- tasm of the archive (see 95-101). Derrida writes in the opening lines of the Postscript: "For more than twenty years, each time I've returned to Naples, I've thought of her. Who better than Gradiva, I said to myself this time . . ." (97). 13/ The phantasm is, thus, in some sense, a projection on the part of the subject that is then taken to be something external to the subject, a projection that then has real effects in the world, effects and affects that then reinforce the phantasm. Derrida gives a rather banal example of this in the interview first pub- lished in Le monde in August 2004 and subsequently published as Learning to Live Finally. In that inter- view, Derrida speaks of refusing to give in to the pressures of an intimidating readership - or, rather, to the pressures of the "phantasm" of such a readership - that would require him to simplify his writing, to give up on paradox on aporia in the name of accessibility. This illusion or phantasm of such a readership thus ends up contributing to the production of it. As Derrida says of his own writing, "Each book is a pedagogy aimed at forming its reader," a reader who, Derrida would say, remains unpredictable and unforeseen. But "the mass productions that today inundate the press and publishing houses do not form their readers; they presuppose in a phantasmatic and rudimentary fashion a reader who has already been programmed. They thus end up preformatting this very mediocre addressee whom they had postulated in advance." 14/ The passage continues: "Will it be said, to determine the IC as phantasm, that the IC is not true, that that (ça) does not happen like that (comme ça), that this is only a myth? That would indeed be silly, and the silliness would again claim 'sexual experience' as its authority. But yes, that (ça) happens like that (comme ça), and what the greater logic impeccably - this is the right word - demonstrates is that not only is this myth true, but it gives the measure of truth itself, the revelation of truth, the truth of truth. Then the (absolute) phantasm of the IC as (absolute) phantasm is (absolute) truth. Truth is the phantasm itself" (Glas 224a).</page><page sequence="25">Michael Naas 25 15/ Whereas "maternity" resists replacement insofar as it marks simply the ineluctability of birth, the mother can always be replaced - or killed, giving way to substitution, fiction, and phantasmatic specula- tion. Such a thought of the mother can also be found in Archive Fever, the same text in which Derrida speaks at such length of Gradiva: "[Freud] makes a mistake in affirming that there can be no doubt about the identity of the mother, insofar as it depends on the witness of the senses, while the identity of the father always remains doubtful since it depends, and it alone, on a rational inference, as that "legal fiction" of which Stephen speaks in Joyce's Ulysses. However, better than ever today, if only with the possibility of surrogate mothers, prosthetic maternities, sperm banks, and all the artificial inseminations, as they are secured for us already and will be secured still more for us in the future by bio-genetic techno-science, we know that maternity is as inferred, constructed, and interpreted as paternity. And as paternal law. In truth, it has always been thus, for the one and for the other" (47-48). WORKS CITED Jacques Derrida. "As if I were Dead: An Interview with Jacques Derrida."
