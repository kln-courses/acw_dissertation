It is lacking in wealth, so it is not seen in the high places. A creature with a white head and Negro feet struts the Metropolitan boards. The real Negro theatre is in the looks and the cabarets. Self-conscious individuals may turn away the eye and say, 'Let us search elsewhere for our dramatic art.' Let 'em search. They certainly won't find it.

One play in particular, Cold Keener (1930), offers an invaluable glimpse into Hurston's creativity, as well as an unparalleled insight into this never performed and largely invisible aspect of Hurston's life's work. Cold Keener innovatively fuses the collections of folklore that made Hurston famous and made her novels possible.4 The play consists of nine disparate skits: "Filling Sta tion," "Cock Robin," "Heaven," "Mr. Frog," "Lenox Avenue," "House that Jack Built," "Bahamas," "Railroad Camp," and "Jook." Taking the form of a revue, gamblers, urban pimps, a version of Eugene O'Neill's Emperor Jones, and an adulterous bird share one stage. Likewise, the settings range from a gas station, a Florida swamp, and a Southern schoolhouse to Harlem's Lenox Avenue, a bar-cabaret, and even the gates of heaven. Read on their own, half of the skits?including "Mr. Frog," "House that Jack Built," "Railroad Camp," and "Jook"?seem to present straightforward renditions of children's songs, blues ballads, and work- or folksongs. The others?"Filling Sta tion," "Cock Robin," "Heaven," "Lenox Avenue," and "Bahamas"?are brief scenes, sometimes including song bits, that dramatize such incidents as a heated conflict between gas-station patrons or the inter-related dialogues and performances on a busy urban street corner. Taken together, their diverse themes, spaces, and shifting audience orientation offer a significant insight into how Hurston conceived of the singular potential of theatre and live performance in relation to her more well-known works of folklore and fiction. Hurston's commitment to making a life in theatre is evident. In biographical narratives and in letter after letter to friends, she expressed her dream of spearheading a theatre in New York City. In fact, her move to New York in 1925 and entr?e into the Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists with which she is identified can be attributed to a play, Color Struck?one of only two plays published during her lifetime, which won second prize in Opportunity Magazine's 1925 contest for best play.5 In her biography of Hurston, Valerie Boyd describes the awards dinner as a watershed moment: "All the present and future luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance were there."6 From that point forward, Hurston strove to make a name for herself, as well as a living, from the theatre. When Hurston enrolled at Barnard College in 1925, she listed "dramatics" as her principal extracurricular activity.7 She wrote plays from about 1925 until 1944, worked in a variety of theatrical capacities throughout her life, was invited to begin and run drama departments in two Southern colleges, wrote skits for the Broadway revue Fast and Furious in 1931, and managed to stage several successful incarnations of a revue of her own, The Great Day.8 Hurston was certainly not alone in her desire 4 The apt title means "abrupt change of setting, mood, and language"; see Barbara Speisman, "From Spears to The Great Day: Zora Neale Hurston's Vision of a Real Negro Theater," Southern Quarterly 36, no. 3 (1998): 41. 5 The other was a one-act play, The First One, first published in Ebony and Topaz (1927). Hurston's short story "Spunk" also won that year.

The popularity of the minstrel show since the 1840s and the prevalence of black performers on the white stage during the 1920s left the New Negro theatre artist and playwright with the precarious task of remaking the image of African Americans within a long history of white audience expectations.10 This task, and the position of the black theatre artist, was further complicated by the financial difficulties of making and sustaining a life in the theatre. Although there were many prizes available for talented black artists like Hurston, oftentimes "the rewards and responsibilities of full cultural participation were not among them."11 While versions of Hurston's original revue were often well received from New York to Florida, they never managed to bring her the financial success that she so desperately needed. Nevertheless, Hurston remained devoted to the theatre and made special efforts to preserve her unperformed scripts. Hurston frequently wrote about what she believed to be the "authentic" or "real" in the theatre. In her short, seminal essay "Characteristics of Negro Expression" (1934), Hurston is clear about the significance of theatre to black expression: "Every phase of Negro life is highly dramatized. . . . Everything is acted out."12 In addition to as serting the theatricality of everyday black expression, Hurston proposed a dramatic structure derived from African visual art, specifically sculpture: "I depart for the South to chisel out a figure in art. I want it to have all the rhythm, harmony, asymmetry of an African sculpted figure."13 Additionally, in "Characteristics," Hurston discussed what she identified as the distinctive asymmetry and angularity in black styles of literature, art, and, most notably, dance. According to her, angularity was an inherent feature of black expression: "After adornment, the next most striking manifestation of the Ne gro is Angularity. Everything that he touches becomes angular."14 Hurston devotes a brief section to the topic of angularity following a section titled "Adornment," where she discusses how black culture adorns language through the oral uses of metaphor (for example, "that's a lynch"), double-descriptives ("low-down"), and verbal nouns ("funeralize," "jook some").15 Although Hurston analyzes angularity in terms of home d?cor and dance, I argue that the roots of her distinct dramaturgy?as it relates to her prescient conceptions of the links between race and performance?are articulated in these few pages about angularity. In "Characteristics," Hurston makes it clear that race is constituted by particular per formance styles and is, in itself, theatrical; in other words, race is performed everyday, on the streets and in the fields. Hurston's hope was to make this performance explicit by bringing it onto the stage and by forcing the audience to reckon with race in the lived and present moment of the theatre. Taken one step further, to where I believe 9 Ann Douglas, Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1995), 55. 10 See both ibid, and Krasner, A Beautiful Pageant, for lengthier discussions of the predicament of black theatre artists and performers vis-?-vis the minstrel tradition. 11 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 99. 12 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression/' 31. 13 Hurston, letter, 28 February 1932, in Zora Neale Hurston, 274. 14 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 34. 15 Ibid., 33.</page><page sequence="4">40 / Jennifer A. Cayer her plays lead us, theatre is the space where racial, cultural, and social imaginaries can be enacted. In contrast to the prevalent cultural models of her day, which sought to taxonomize the static features of a unified and coherent cultural group, in Culture, 1922, Hurston was, according to Marc Manganaro, "a participant in the formation of the modern concept of culture . . . that would come to predominate in the late part of the 20th century . . . that is culture as porous, as fluid, as mobile."16 Manganaro's description of a porous and mobile culture could also describe Hurston's field work practice; in the collection and study of black folklore that made her famous, she strove for a fluidity between herself as an ethnographer and her informants. Performance was thus an important methodology for Hurston to bring to life the unpredictable colli sion of human energies that was the bedrock of culture. And in her interpretation of angularity, she found a distinctly black aesthetic structure that best suited the creation of this type of theatrical encounter. In several letters to her friend and one-time collaborator Langston Hughes, she makes the connection between angularity and theatre more directly: "Did I tell you before I left about the new, the real Negro art theatre I plan? Well, I shall, or rather we shall act out the folk tales, however short, with the abrupt angularity and naivete of the primitive 'bama [Alabama] nigger."17 The play Cold Keener, when read alongside her various writings on performance and lifelong work in the theatre, emerges as the dramatic embodiment of her truncated and opaque statements about an angular theatre. For Hurston, the angularity that she observed in the arrangement of home furnishings and dance styles was a way to avoid the "simple straight line."18 The linear, for her, is associated with a certain set of "European" aesthetic conventions and expectations. In Cold Keener, Hurston applies her notion of angularity to drama on multiple levels: from abrupt shifts in theme and dramatic space, to how the audience gains access and is situated in relation to each performed skit. Hurston's angular structure allowed her to present a great deal of material?from the deep South to Harlem's Lenox Avenue?in the length of a standard play and at the expense of developing centralized, individual, and linear plot-lines. In her discussion of Hurston's collaboration with Langston Hughes, Rachel Rosenberg writes that for Hurston, "There is no need to settle on a single ver sion of a story, as there is in the linear dramatic plots that dominate Broadway, or on a final written version of a script that will displace other possible versions."19 This aversion to the straight line is perhaps one reason why many of her plays have been criticized or dismissed. John Lowe, among others, criticizes both The Mule-Bone and Polk County for lacking "a compelling story line."20 But this absence is precisely what Hurston articulates in her "Characteristics" es say as one of the key features of black expression. In Cold Keener, she is deliberately creating a nonlinear dramatic form by drawing her dramaturgy from a broader rep ertoire of visual art and dance. This breadth of inspiration gives rise to what she calls 16 Marc Manganaro, Culture, 1922: The Emergence of a Concept (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002), 198. 17 Hurston, letter, 12 April 1928, in Zora Neale Hurston, 116. 18 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 34. 19 Rachel A.

In "Characteristics," she suggests how the "abrupt and unexpected changes" in the dance movements of Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips serve to provoke the spectator: "That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt. He is participating in the performance himself?carrying out the suggestions of the performer."22 Likewise, some skits in Cold Keener collapse the distance between performer and spectator as if creating a more collective experience; others emphasize this gap, reminding the spectators that they are not, and perhaps cannot, be part of the staged experience. These oscillating moments of inclusion and exclusion are linked to Hurston's negotiation of the expectations of white and black audiences alike within a single play. The way she abruptly shifts audience access to the spectacle among the skits in Cold Keener is the most striking and distinguishing feature of her angular dra maturgy, and one that is the most difficult to account for in a printed script. Because Cold Keener was never performed, there are no reviews, audience testimonials, or any record of spectatorial experience. There are clues, however, in the script that suggest the kind of collective encounter that only theatre could offer. The organization of the skits and the implications of certain stage directions suggest that Hurston is playing with degrees of audience involvement and identification by offering different levels of spectatorial experience, from the distanced and solely visual to the embodied and enmeshed. And yet, despite the uniqueness of her vision and the rediscovered cache of plays and skits now widely available both online and in published form, Hurston's work as a playwright and producer has received scant critical attention.23 Shortly after the discovery of the manuscripts, Barbara Speisman, in a 1998 article, included a compre hensive plot summary of Cold Keener, emphasizing thematic links to Hurston's other nondramatic works and its place within her theatre career. This is reproduced as the sole introduction to the 2005 collection. John Lowe also revisited his earlier research on Hurston as a dramatist upon the discovery of the unpublished plays. And yet, like Speisman's, his well-researched 2002 article offers little more than plot summaries for Polk County, Cold Keener, and Spunk. Building on these studies, I would like to offer an account of why these plays have been neglected, and suggest a new way of thinking about and reading angularity in them. I believe there is much more work to be done, and much more we can learn from the particulars of Hurston's theatricality and the political stakes of her dramatic pursuits. Bodies between the Lines In "Characteristics," Hurston writes: "The white man thinks in written language and the Negro thinks in hieroglyphics."24 Whereas the alphabet is meant to transfer an idea to the eye or the mind, hieroglyphics, Ann Douglas suggests, "were meant to convey more to the senses."25 This distinction between seeing and feeling resonates with the 21 Hurston, letter, 1 May 1928, in Zora Neale Hurston, 117. 22 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 35. 23A notable and recent exception is Diamond, "Deploying/Destroying the Primitivist Body," 112-32. 24 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 32. 25 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 423. It is also important to note that Hurston is not alone in referencing the hieroglyphic in relation to performance, the body, language, and subjectivity. Antonin Artaud re</page><page sequence="6">42 / Jennifer A. Cay er heart of how Hurston imagined the theatre as a place for an embodied and collective encounter, rather than a purely visual spectacle or display. Embedded in Hurston's theatrical vision are ideal spectators who will be moved to rise from their seats and join in. It is through the theatre that Hurston strove to galvanize her sociopolitical belief in the potential for black expressive arts and demonstrated her commitment to the collective experience of the theatre. This was Hurston's distinct and controversial response to the ubiquity of popular performances by black artists for white audiences and what Douglas calls the well recognized phenomenon of the "Negroization of American culture" during the 1920s.26 For Hurston, the prospect of a song, dance, or collective scene inciting a spectator to sing along, dance along, or feel a part of the crowd was a tantalizing alternative to reifying black expressive forms in a written text or artificial folk performance. Barbara Johnson writes of Hurston that she deplored the appropriation, dilution and commodification of black culture (through spirituals, jazz, etc.) by the pre-Depression white world, and she constantly tried to explain the difference between a reified "art" and a living culture in which the distinctions between spectator and spectacle, rehearsal and performance, experience and representation, are not fixed.27 Hurston's angular theatrical structure aimed for precisely this kind of embodied and spontaneous encounter. Cold Keener is less a play, as it is often understood, than a template for the collective encounter that Hurston desired. Manganaro, writing about Hurston's literary anthro pology, suggests that "[h]er work, in other words, is not about 'grasping the native's point of view' but about inhabiting it."28 Angularity in dramatic performance was a structural means for Hurston to present the manifold aspects of black song, dance, and storytelling. And the oral, collective, performative, and participatory potential of the theatre meant that each audience member could have an individual and embod ied encounter with the work. Rather than merely representing folkloric material as a static spectacle, her mission is captured in the exuberant call in the final skit, "Jook," to "Roll yo' hips." Hurston took this call seriously. In an article on Mules and Men, Cheryl Wall praises Hurston for anticipating "the work of current-day anthropologists by several decades," because during the 1930s, she "both theorized and put into practice the concept of per formance."29 Although multiple critics like Manganaro and Wall have lauded Hurston for her prescient ethnographic practices, drawing upon the rhetoric of performance, few fers to the "new physical language, based upon signs and no longer upon words" of Balinese actors, who he describes as "animated hieroglyphs." In another important line of comparison that I will not follow up here, relating to the popularity of angularity and primitivism, Artaud refers to their vocal movements as "angular and abruptly abandoned attitudes"; see Artaud, The Theater and Its Double, trans. Mary Caroline Richards (New York: Grove Press, 1958), 54. 26 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 77. 27 Barbara Johnson, A World of Difference (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), 159. 28 Manganaro, Culture, 1922, 185. 29 Cheryl Wall uses folklorist Richard Bauman's definition of performance as "the enactment of a poetic function, the essence of spoken artistry"; see Wall, "Mules and Men and Women: Zora Neale Hurston's Strategies of Narration and Visions of Female Empowerment," in Critical Essays on Zora Neale Hurston, ed. Gloria L. Cronin (New York: G. K. Hall, 1998), 56.</page><page sequence="7">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 43 have looked closely at how her plays?as undeveloped performance templates?func tion to this end.30 Manganaro and others have pointed to how language functioned as action for Hurston: "Hurston essentially holds that words can do things in the world, that they have real human agency."31 Similarly, John Edgar Wideman asserts that "[a]uthenticity of character, of experience are related by Hurston to the connection between word and act."32 For Hurston, the distinctiveness of the black character and ethos comes into being through specific oral styles and interactions. And, the accom panying implication?that words hold real power in an everyday way to alter social realities?is especially relevant for Hurston's conception of the collective and authentic theatrical encounter.33 The performed word is not representative or informative, but constitutive of identity and community.34 Elin Diamond's definition of performance in Modern Drama is particularly apt: "Performance is that messy historicizing moment that interrupts the integrity of the written document."35 Hurston's privileging of supposedly nonliterary or oral realms in performance is a way of staging in real and present time a new recognition of an invisible history. The time and space of the theatre enforced the idea that black folkloric forms are not of the past, but the present in the making. I argue that Hurston's continual reworking of the relationship between the performer and spectator, via her own use of an angular dramatic structure, was an attempt to solve a growing uneasiness with the authoritative elements of her developing ethno graphic practice. For Hurston, anxieties about how it is, or isn't, possible to "read" black culture could be resolved in the domain of seeing, hearing, feeling, and performance. Performance, or the embodiment of the word and the live action of the encounter, was the powerful medium and an antidote to a reifying written document. During her lifetime and today, Hurston's dramatic vision has been either cast aside or altered to fit current concerns. To date, only one of the found plays?Polk County, co-written with Dorothy Waring?has been performed. It premiered in 2002 at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC, followed by short runs on the regional-theatre circuit, including performances at the McCarter Theatre Center and the Berkeley Repertory.36 30 Interestingly, the recent critical language employed to describe Hurston's fictional and ethnographic works is often theatrical. Henry Louis Gates Jr., who has written extensively on Hurston, describes Their Eyes Were Watching God as "the speakerly text" and asserts: "The language of her characters dances; her texts seem to come alive as veritable 'talking books'"; see Gates and K. A. Appiah, eds., Zora Neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past and Present (New York: Amistad, 1993), xii, 154. Additionally, for Gates, her short stories are "dress rehearsals for scenes that she would develop in her novels"; see Gates and Sieglinde Lenke, eds., Zora Neale Hurston: The Complete Stories (New York: Harper Collins, 1995), xiii. 31 Manganaro, Culture, 1922, 194. 32 John Edgar Wideman, "Defining the Black Voice in Fiction," Black American Literature Forum 11, no. 3 (1977): 82. 33 To be sure, British philosopher and linguist J. L. Austin's formulation in the 1950s of the performa tive or speech act, later published in How to Do Things with Words (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1962), haunts much of this writing on Hurston. Austin's work has also become a foundational text for the discipline of performance studies. 34 For example, in "Story in Harlem Slang," one of the stories adapted and dramatized in Spunk (1990) and directed by George C. Wolfe, the main character renames himself upon his move to Harlem from the South, thus inaugurating a new identity. 35Elin Diamond, "Modern Drama/Modernity's Drama," in Modern Drama: Defining the Field, eds.

Cay er The majority have been critically ignored. And so we must ask: What is it about Hurston's script that belies live performance? As Carla Kaplan, editor of a recent col lection of Hurston's letters, astutely writes with regard to the nature of canonization: "We have probably created the Hurston that we need and want, bracketing whatever does not fit."37 The plays certainly did not fit during her lifetime, and the question remains: What is it about Cold Keener that still doesn't fit? Is it something inherent to the themes of the play? Or is it because it is a play? How is it that the dramatic output of one of the most celebrated literary artists of the twentieth century was lost, and remains doubly lost in its recovery? Hurston's dramatic work clearly strikes a strange note. It inspires dismissal, confu sion, and a hard-to-identify discomfort?just a few of the reasons it doesn't fall easily into upcoming theatre seasons or existing scholarship, not to mention theoretical or political interests. At odds with the majority of her Harlem Renaissance peers, the controversial issues that Hurston raises?about the aims and sources for black theatre; the uses of dialect and the vernacular; and the relationships among performance, race, and politics?persist in contemporary cultural debates. Rather than dismissing the plays for being out-of-sync both in her own time and today, there is a revealing con tinuum between the reasons her work was not well received then as now. The essay that follows will provide a brief history of Hurston's theatrical aspirations and actual work in the New York theatre, explore her relationship to both Harlem Renaissance and contemporary critical interlocutors, and suggest the ways in which theatre is a natural outgrowth of her work as a folklorist and a significant aesthetic intervention. I will then analyze how Hurston's angularity operates on the levels of theme, staged space, and perspective in Cold Keener. Hurston's Life in the Theatre The few assessments of Hurston's impact as a dramatist have been eclipsed by her notorious collaboration with Langston Hughes on the play, The Mule-Bone (1931). Prior to their infamous disagreement, Hurston wrote often to Hughes with regard to play writing and collaborating. In one letter she wrote: Do you want to look over what I have on our show? Let's call it "JOOK" that is the word for bawdy house in its general sense. It is the club house on these saw mills and terpentine stills. Then we can bring in all the songs and gags I have. Shall we work on it at once? I am willing if you are. I know that G. [Charlotte Osgood Mason] would never consent for me to do so, so you will have to take it all in your name.38 Hurston's Tolk County' you're going to be asking yourself how this lively piece of African-Americana could have been allowed to sit out the last half-century unpublished and unproduced on a dusty shelf," in Bob Mondello, "Beautiful South: Polk County; Directed by Kyle Donnelly," Washington City Paper, 12-18 April 2002; and "The production could contradict?or stoke?the criticism that Hurston was perpetuating negative stereotypes," in William Triplett, "The Undiscovered Country: Zora Neale Hurston's Tolk County,' Lost for Decades, Finally Gets its World Premiere This Week at Arena Stage," Washington Post, 7 April 2002. 37 Kaplan, Zora Neale Hurston, 31. 38 Ibid., letter, spring/summer 1929,143. Hurston's theatrical output was both fostered and hindered by Mason, often referred to as "Godmother" in her letters. Mason also served as a patron to Alain Locke and Langston Hughes, among other Harlem Renaissance figures. Hurston's letters often portray Mason as a spiritual and generous benefactor.</page><page sequence="9">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 45 Hurston's desire to call the play "Jook" illustrates the centrality of the bar-cabaret dance space to the entirety of her theatrical work. Consequently, "Jook" is the title of the final skit in Cold Keener. As she wrote elsewhere, echoing a common refrain of hers, "[t]he Negro theatre, as built up by the Negro is based on Jook situations, with women, gambling, fighting, and drinking."39 Hurston considered the jook to be the birthplace of secular blues music and jazz, and as such, she considered it "the most important place in America."40 Later that same year, she wrote to Hughes announcing seven skits that she had ready for their collaboration. But at least five, including "Jook," appear to end up in Cold Keener, suggesting that it is perhaps closer to how she imagined a longstanding collaboration with Hughes, rather than what eventually became the contested The Mule-Bone. The result of this collaboration was a grave disappointment and the end of a powerful friendship for both artists. In the end, the piece was finished though never performed until its resurrection in 1991.41 The failed collaboration with Hughes on The Mule-Bone can be attributed, among other things, to Hughes's and Hurston's conflicting views of the relationship between folk material and the theatre. Rachel Rosenberg offers a perceptive analysis of the col laboration and controversy, attributing the fallout to Hughes's and Hurston's radically different views of authorship. In brief, Hurston considered the play her own, because she collected and performed the material firsthand, whereas Hughes, who lent the structure and plot-line, considered himself to be the primary author. Through her read ing of archival documents and versions of the play, Rosenberg asserts that Hurston "may have expected Hughes to perform as well, participating in a creative process like vernacular folk performance, with its permeable boundary between artists and audi ence who swap roles frequently so that all are potentially artists themselves."42 This insight is central for Cold Keener, because in it Hurston fosters this kind of permeable boundary and encourages the audience to participate and become involved. Rosenberg continues: "Hurston claimed sole authorship using the vocabulary of performance."43 Hurston often performed in her revues as a dancer, singer, or member of the crowd; she loved acting and actors. It follows, then, that the authenticity of representation had to be found for Hurston in the performance of the play, as opposed to its written, structured, and permanent text. But The Mule-Bone, like all of Hurston's work in the theatre, was complicated by something much more tangible than clashing visions of performance: white patronage. Hurston's reliance on a benevolent if complex patron most certainly impinged on her work in the theatre. As a contractual "agent" for Charlotte Osgood Mason from 1927 until 1932, Hurston was forced to marginalize her own interests in the theatre in order to satisfy her patron's avowed primitivism, not to mention financial control. Mason, a wealthy Fifth Avenue widow and devotee of the black arts, gave Hurston $200 per 39 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 41. 40 Ibid., 40. 41 For fuller discussions of the The Mule-Bone controversy and the play script, see George Houston Bass and Henry Louis Gates Jr., eds., Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life (New York: Harper Collins, 1991), and Rosenberg, "Looking for Zora's Mule Bone," 79-105. 42 Rosenberg, "Looking for Zora's Mule Bone," 82. 43 Ibid., 83.</page><page sequence="10">46 / Jennifer A. Cayer month and granted access to a car and a camera for the express purposes of collecting "music, folk-lore, poetry, hoodoo, conjure, manifestations of art, and kindred matters existing among the American Negroes."44 Aside from lending Hurston the funds for her revue, The Great Day, which premiered at the John Golden Theater on 10 January 1932 and played at the New School in March of that same year, Mason "refused to let Hurston ever again put on a play as written and also forbade the theatrical use of other portions of Mules and Men."45 Mason felt that the venture would be too commercial and almost guaranteed "a prostitution of Hurston's authentic black material."46 Also, because Hurston's revue was not picked up by a producer and only earned $261 at the box office ($88 of which was from tickets purchased by Mason), Hurston could not afford to pay her performers. Mason paid them, and again Hurston was in debted.47 Her relationship with Mason cannot be underestimated as we try to untangle Hurston's vision of the theatre from the desires of white producers and audiences. Mason was just one of many cultural figures who influenced the creation of black art; in fact, two of the most well-known and established "black theaters in Harlem were white-owned and run."48 Dependency on white patronage further complicated the position of the black theatre artist. Douglas writes that "they were forced to negotiate white control in ways that helped to clarify and intensify as well as obscure the modern black enterprise."49 Negotiating the palpable legacies of the minstrel tradition, along with the power of white audience demands and producers, was no doubt a tricky endeavor. The parameters on what types of representations in the theatre could be called "authentic" was complicated by the history of white minstrelsy, followed by black minstrel performers claiming to be ex-slaves and thus even more "genuine."50 Given this history, Hurston's own constellation of primitivism, angularity, and a particular version of authenticity was often condemned. Both her work and Hurston herself were criticized for pandering to a white audience?whether it was a wealthy benefactor or in the theatre. Douglas further maintains: "The New Negro was a figure with few claims on mainline America's attention, interest, or sympathy. If he insulted or displeased, he could be cut off, erased, without a thought or regret."51 Hurston's published works are most certainly the product of such careful negotiations between patronage and audience expectations. In light of these difficulties, I believe that the archived plays, many written away from Mason's view and with greater autonomy, offer integral clues to Hurston's own ideas about angularity and the theatre. The challenges before Hurston were profuse. Perhaps even more painful to her than the specter of white money controlling the theatre was the difficulty she faced from her fellow black peers. Langston Hughes was not the only one who disagreed with her; many intellectuals and artists felt that her work was artificial at best, and detri mental to black progress at worst. Blacks in the theatre could not ignore the shadow of minstrelsy over their efforts to refashion the black stage.

In his scathing review of Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Richard Wright ac cused Hurston of voluntarily continuing] in her novel the tradition which was forced upon the Negro in the theater, that is, the minstrel technique that makes the "white folks" laugh. Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work and kill; they swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.54 Years later, in what appears to be a direct response to Wright's criticism, Hurston at tempted to clarify her oftentimes controversial and contradictory views in a feature interview in the New York Amsterdam News: "There is an oversimplification of the Negro. He is either pictured by the conservatives as happy, picking his banjo, or by the so called liberals as low, miserable, and crying. The Negro's life is neither of these. Rather it is in between and above and below these pictures."55 Hurston aims in these plays to write "in between." Far from what Wright calls a "narrow orbit," the in-between space for Hurston was the generative and authentic space that theatre could open up between a static representation and a live audience. Despite Hurston's aim, the use of dialect on the page and on the stage was a fiercely debated topic. Because of this, featuring "folk" material in the theatre was plagued from the start. In a brief history of American literary dialect, Lisa Cohen Minnick points to how, at the time of Hurston's writing, the dialect performed in minstrel shows was still inextricably connected to "negative, stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans."56 Later, in a 1977 essay on black dialect, Wideman reiterates this association; he argues that black speech as written is at once arbitrary, emasculating, immature, and deprived of "the spontaneity of improvisation, gesture, intonation, song, dance, mime, effects, metrical and rhythmical structures"?in short, performance.57 From Wideman's per spective, the theatre enables Hurston to restore to dialect its performative elements. Minnick goes on directly to address the fallacies of Wright's oft-cited criticism of Their Eyes: "Labeling Hurston an upholder of the minstrel tradition in terms of what is ac tually contained in the text is not accurate and seems to be designed more to punish her for failing to toe the party line."58 No doubt, Hurston's at turns vague, extreme, 52 Ibid., 75. 53 See in-depth studies of minstrelsy, including: Eric Lott, Theft and Love: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993); and Joseph Buskin, Sambo: The Rise and Fall of an American Jester (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). Ann Douglas provides a brief definition of the minstrel show: "Dating back to the 1840s as a specialty act, the minstrel show was a medley of purportedly Negro jokes, tall tales, song-and-dance routines, and spoofs of elite art and con temporary manners that had its roots in Southern Negro plantation culture"; see Terrible Honesty, 75. 54 In New Masses (5 October 1937), reprinted in Gates and Appiah, Zora Neale Hurston, 17. 55 In an interview with Constance Curtis, "Zora Neale Hurston Reveals Key to Her Literary Success," New York Amsterdam News, 18 November 1944. 56 Lisa Cohen Minnick, Dialect and Dichotomy: Literary Representations of African American Speech (Tus caloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2004), xiv.

Cayer and changeable political views undermined perceptions of her aims in writing and performing in dialect. She had to develop a dramaturgy that could mitigate the threat of re-representing stereotypical images of black life. Upon first sight, because of the play's revue structure and drastic shifts in emotional register, Wright's criticism might be applied to Cold Keener. To be sure, Hurston's angular structure gives way to dramatic shifts, from murder to a happy-go-lucky children's song, but these are not meant to obscure the social realities of black life in America. Hurston's angularity was strategic. Fully aware of the pitfalls of representing South ern black life for a white audience, she sought to resolve the problem of authenticity through a fractured, contrasting, and angular structure. She located authenticity not in the solo skill of the performer or the veracity of the folk performance, but in the space of encounter that she could both foster and control between the spectacle and spectator. Hurston's faith in this encounter girded all she did in the theatre. She believed deeply in the potential for an authentic experience, and with it, a deeper understanding. Not surprisingly, her conviction also made her furious at the creative black people around her who she didn't see as sharing that belief. Hurston openly derided what she viewed as the hypocrisy of black intellectuals: "I am on fire about my people. I need not con cern myself with the few individuals who have quit the race via the tea table."59 In her vocal denigration of propaganda and commitment to using dialect, she risked being perceived as lacking a political agenda, or even being detrimental to black progress; at the same time, in her pursuit of authenticity she risked being dubbed stereotypical. These factors directly hindered her work in the theatre. In 1925, even though Hurston was involved with a theatre group founded by W. E. B. DuBois under the auspices of the NAACP, none of her dramatic contributions were performed.60 Although Hurston was in agreement with DuBois's requirements for a real Negro theatre?that it be "About us, By us, For us and Near us"61?they disagreed with what constituted the "real" or "authentic." For DuBois, the real, as Paul Carter Harrison asserts, was synonymous with "respectable";62 conversely, Hurston's real was synonymous with the everyday, from the gritty to the grandiose and everything in between. Hurston's dramatic output is an attempt to create an authentic, politically advantageous art form, albeit without the use of propaganda. She disdained race prejudice of any variety, and expressed impatience with any extremist view that leaned toward glossing over the everyday in favor of advancing a political cause. This is not to say, however, that her work was apolitical or that her political views were always consistent.63 Most Harlem Renaissance artists represented middle-class, urban black culture, whereas Hurston's subjects included rural Southern blacks.64 At once intimately familiar 59 Hurston, letter, 15 October 1931, in Zora Neale Hurston, 235. 60 Boyd, Wrapped in Rainbows, 118. 61W.

In his analysis of one of Hurston's few published plays, Color Struck, David Krasner emphasizes how Hurston's project was one of writing about the invisible side of the great migration: "For Hurston, rural black people were being forgotten, disappearing amidst the heady enthusiasm of the urban New Negro movement."66 Those who did not migrate threatened to become invisible, and Hurston was committed to giving them a presence on the New York stage.67 One explanation for the neglect of Hurston's theatrical work, and the difficul ties she faced getting her work produced, is that her favored themes?what she saw as vital black expressive forms?troubled many people's definitions of progressive, racially advantageous, and representative art. In a 1944 article, Hurston claimed that "I'm sick of the race problem because it makes us pamphleteers rather than artists."68 It is hardly surprising that such themes, along with her bold proclamations, did not curry favor with many of her Harlem Renaissance peers. The poet Sterling Brown, for example, criticized Mules and Men outright for not including references to lynching or race riots and, in effect, whitewashing reality.69 Hurston's personal ties and academic interests in the South were largely received as incompatible with political progress. Hurston was committed to representing Southern culture, but she approached both Harlem and Florida as a folklorist. In Cold Keener, two skits take place in New York, while six are in the South. As a way to negotiate her commitment to Southern styles of expression with her observations of life in New York, Hurston's conception of an angular theatre also became an apt venue for representing both urban and rural life on the same stage. Based on the series of home addresses from the North to the South in Kaplan's collection of correspondence, it can be said that Hurston called neither and both home. As a result, both the streets of Harlem and the South provided her with rich theatrical material. In turn, her writing has been described as both "agrarian modernism" by Michael Denning and "urban pastoralism" by Deirdre Egan.70 These contrasting sets of terms provide keys to Hurston's complex negotiations between the urban and rural, the North and the South. Egan suggests how Hurston functions as a kind of conduit for cultural exchange, and discusses the way that both the rural and the urban come to constitute the "modern" in her work. Hurston's emphasis on rural spaces is not a nostalgic enterprise at all, but one committed to understanding how shifts in location and language serve to produce the modern identity. In a section of her "Characteristics" essay titled "Negro Folklore," Hurston asserts that folklore is current?in fact, modern: "Negro folklore is not a thing of the past. It is still in the 65 Ibid., letter, 15 October 1931, 234. 66Krasner, A Beautiful Pageant, 114. 67 450,000 blacks left the South between 1910 and 1920, and 749,000 more did during the following decade. Between 1900 and 1930, the black population in the North increased by almost 300 percent.

Cayer making."71 Her project is much more than one of recovery and preservation; it seeks to create an ongoing engagement with a multiplicity of folkloric forms and communities, not only those of the rural South. Black expressive forms, we learn, are not isolated to the South, but played out equally on the Northern city streets. Moreover, because folk material is contemporary, living, and evolving, it is not without political relevance and resonance. As a peripatetic artist herself, Hurston was keenly aware of how place and, in turn, community influenced language style and the expressive potentials and limits on personal character. One of the most interesting results of staging the North and the South together in Cold Keener is how Hurston reveals the distinct contours of public space. Her theatre represents the relationship between the individual and the community in both urban Harlem and rural Florida, and the restrictions and possibilities of personal and collec tive expression in public space. Although configured differently in her urban spaces, community is a key theme for Hurston; her casts are often quite large. In a section of "Characteristics" titled "Absence of the Concept of Privacy," she refers to the com munal, "all-permeating drama" of everyday demonstrations of verbal acumen, sex appeal, and swagger in black culture.72 Contemporary scholars, including Minnick, have suggested that Hurston portrays the black community in relation to itself, rather than as a product of outside pressures or influences.73 Hurston's focus in these plays on communal rather than individual character or psychological expression also did not appeal to her so-called modernist peers. Perhaps it was inevitable that her relationship to the theatre would be complex, for such was her relationship with so many of the black artists of her day. Her deep desire for a particular kind of authenticity and her fearlessness about depicting essential ele ments of black life?elements that made many of her peers cringe?would guarantee that her vision of theatre remained unpopular. Hurston's idea of the theatre relied on a different kind of authenticity, which could ultimately only be derived from her own firsthand arrangements of music, dance, and dramatic material. In September 1928, she wrote to Hughes: "It makes me sick to see how those cheap white folks are grabbing our stuff and ruining it. I am almost sick?my one consolation being that they never do it right and so there is still a chance for us."74 As Kaplan explains: "While white reviewers lauded her for opening an 'authentic' window on an exotic and fascinating 'different world,' her black contemporaries attacked her as an apolitical opportunist complicit with racist stereotypes of blacks as simple, rural, uncultured folk."75 Hurston's use of folk material was uniformly subject to criticism and she continu ally struggled with white producers, who were typically the gatekeepers for most of the arts in New York. Rosenberg writes of white producers: "Their formula prevented any frequent departures from the use of minstrel-like malapropisms and chicanery as the basis of the shows' comedy."76 The existence of Hurston's many unproduced plays certainly attests to the difficulty, financial and otherwise, she must have encountered in producing her material independently. 71 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 36. 72 Ibid., 39. 73 Minnick, Dialect and Dichotomy, 26-27. 74 Hurston, letter, 20 September 1928, in Zora Neale Hurston, 126. 75 Ibid., Kaplan, 26. 76 Rosenberg, "Looking for Zora's Mule Bone," 84.</page><page sequence="15">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 51 Linking Folklore and Theatre Hurston's theatre practice was directly linked to her development as a folklorist and ethnographer. As an anthropology undergraduate at Barnard (from 1925 to 1928) and working under Franz Boas, she began augmenting her ongoing efforts to produce authentic black spirituals and theatre for New York audiences with her growing col lection of folkloric material. Hurston wrote to her friend, the photographer Carl Van Vechten, about finding a troupe of singers for her revue, declaring: "You will hear a spiritual done SPIRITUALLY/'77 Negro spirituals sung in concert by black artists like Paul Robeson "became a vogue in the 1920s for white Americans/'78 In "Character istics," Hurston refers to the inadequacy of the "bleached chorus" and the ways in which black folk culture was interpreted for the demand of white audiences.79 Often invited to add "color"?or the veneer of authenticity?to productions, she consistently struggled against the misinterpretation, appropriation, and misuse of her own mate rial in the theatre. Indeed, following the success of the all-black musical revue Shuffle Along by songwriters Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle in 1921, "black musicals appeared regularly on Broadway but the profitability of Shuffle Along soon led white producers to take control of the form."80 In the following decade, surely due to the proliferation of such folk revues, intellectuals began to debate the relationship between theatre and folklore. Manganaro further states that in the early 1930s, "anthropology . . . was as changeable and changing as art."81 As both an artist and anthropologist, Hurston would be intimately, though at times awkwardly, involved in this debate. Seemingly comfortable in liminal positions throughout her life?as a proto-liter ary anthropologist, hoodoo initiate, fiction writer, memoirist, and folklore collec tor?Hurston's work as a playwright is the product of a strategic negotiation between the perspectives afforded by both anthropology and theatre. In his analysis of Mules and Men through comparisons with Hurston's anthropological contemporaries and influences, Manganaro asserts that "through cultural performance, [Hurston] fused the 'social' (or anthropological) and the 'aesthetic,'" and Mules and Men is "actually about the very transmutations between art and ethnography."82 Manganaro further asserts, echoing Wall's sentiment, that Hurston, "in her attention to the setting and style of telling, effectively anticipated contemporary performative or contexualist folkloristics."83 Given that, her work in the theatre is the necessary flip-side of the argument and only furthers the understanding of her prescient ideas about ethnography, folk culture, and performance. Her life's work was one of negotiation and mediation among her folkloric material, the concomitant political expectations she faced, and the risks of presenting this material in writing or in the theatre. It must be noted that theatre was not simply another generic receptacle for the presentation of folkloric material; the theme of mediation is central to approaching a more comprehensive understanding of Hurston's life work that includes her plays as crucial works alongside her essays, folklore, and fiction. 77 Hurston, letter, 5 January 1926?library dated, in Zora Neale Hurston, 76. 78 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 96. 79 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 41. 80 Rosenberg, "Looking for Zora's Mule Bone," 84. 81 Manganaro, Culture, 1922, 179. 82 Ibid., 179, 197. 83Ibid., 178.</page><page sequence="16">52 / Jennifer A. Cay er Hurston was forever figuring out how best to mediate her own role: where she should situate herself in her creations. Critics, including Susan Willis and Barbara Johnson, have emphasized the subtle shifts in point of view and positionality in Hurston's memoir, Dust Tracks on a Road, and in her ethnography Mules and Men. Willis suggests that these signal "Hurston's inevitable turmoil and ambivalence over being in the middle and being a mediator."84 However, what became Mules and Men and thus provided critics like Willis and Johnson with grist to examine Hurston's self-reflexivity was far from what Hurston initially envisioned. Originally titled Negro Folktales from the Gulf States, it appears that she wanted to present the collection on its own, without her mediating voice.85 The different structure and the insertion of Hurston as character and collector were added at the insistence of her publisher. As she wrote in 1931 to her patron Ma son, "Covici Friede has asked for the story book [Mules and Men] and suggested that the stories be put in a framework."86 Closely analyzing the nature of this framework, Graciela Hern?ndez concludes that "Hurston casts doubt on the ethnographer's abil ity to adequately represent these different communities and criticizes a discipline that offers people up for view through the lens of the spyglass."87 Disavowing the spyglass altogether, in Dust Tracks on a Road, Hurston writes: "Nothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one person. That is natural. There is no single face in nature because every eye that looks upon it, sees it from its own angle."88 In addition to providing a structure and rationale for the abrupt thematic and spatial shifts in Cold Keener, angularity is also a matter of perspective for Hurston. In theatre, she could apply the idea of angularity to dramatic structure and enact her understanding of black culture. In 1928, two years prior to the copyright registry date for Cold Keener, she wrote effusively to Hughes: "I am getting inside of Negro art and lore. I am beginning to see really and when you join me I shall point things out and see if you see them as I do."89 Here, Hurston reveals what many scholars have pointed to in her ethnographic work as a preoccupation with her own positionality and subjective stance. In the theatre, she could do precisely what she was never able to do with Hughes: sharing things without one set vantage point and exploring how he or an audience may perceive them. The significance of an angular theatre becomes even clearer in light of this history. Rosenberg, discussing the collaborative writing process with Langston Hughes, suggests: "Initially, having just returned from field work where she and her informants improvised on each others' contributions, Hurston would have viewed these performances as an excellent way to bridge the gap between group vernacular folk performances and solitary writing?and among her identities as 'anthropologist,' 'raconteur,' and 'author.'"90 84In Gates and Appiah, Zora Neale Hurston, 111. 85 This version of the collected tales was recently published under a slightly altered title; see Carla Kaplan, ed., Every Tongue Got to Confess: Negro Folk-Tales from the Gulf States (New York: Harper Col lins, 2001). ^Hurston, letter, 25 September 1931, in Zora Neale Hurston, 228. 87 Graciela Hern?ndez, "Multiple Subjectivities and Strategic Positionality: Zora Neale Hurston's Experimental Ethnographies," in Women Writing Culture, eds.

These negotiations and the multiple versions of her collected folklore attest to the power that theatre held for her. Theatre, perhaps more than other genres or art forms, had the capacity to approximate more closely Hurston's own creative process and allowed her to mitigate this anxiety over a single representative perspective. It was only in the theatre?through an angular structure operating on the levels of theme, space, and audience perspective?that Hurston was able both to represent and enact the necessary tension between static performance and the dynamics of collaboration. It was only onstage that she was able to bring to life the conflicting and prismatic facets required to create a truly "authentic" representation. This challenge was only deepened by the realities of the stage, where exploitation by white performers was "part of the ethos of the day," and it was "understood on Broadway: you started black or ethnic and got whiter and more Wasp as, and if, success came your way."91 It is no wonder that in this malleable performative world, where race was a central element of performance, appropriation, and audience interest, that theatre held for Hurston a supremely risky and absolutely inevitable appeal. Hurston was certainly not alone in linking folklore with theatre, as folkloric per formances under the auspices of cultural groups were prevalent during this era. At a folklore panel in 1938 attended by Alain Locke and Hurston and dedicated to debates on the relationship among folk art, modern art, and the nature of folkloric research, playwright Paul Green explicitly linked folklore to what he foresaw as a rise of regional theatre. Later that same year, Green invited Hurston to join a playwriting seminar, and they began discussing a potential collaboration. At the same panel discussion, Locke asserted that despite the seeming popularity of black folk culture in America, representations had been subject to serious distortions and dilutions.92 Again, Hurston's own commitment to folkloric forms seemed to overshadow her theatrical aims. Be cause Hurston was a trained anthropologist, Rosemary Hathaway has suggested that her fictional writings, and I would add her plays, were expected to be scholarly and provide nothing more than accurate representations.93 A review by Charles Collins in the Chicago Daily Tribune of her original revue, Singing Steel (also called The Great Day and From Sun to Sun), as it was presented under her direction at the Chicago Women's Club in 1934, attests to this: "She is a folk-lorist and anthropologist who has specialized in the Afro-American field and this stage arrangement of songs and dances represents intensive research and a contribution to scholarship.... it contains a certain amount of theatrical amusement."94 The current dearth of scholarship on Hurston's dramaturgy echoes this sentiment; theatre, it seems, is either an unsuitable or peripheral repository for folkloric material. In an unpublished set of notes, black arts poet and critic Larry Neal reproduces a quote from someone named Carolyn: "Create the literature, let it be, let it be, let it all hang out, leap out." Neal responds: "I can dig that. But it will be weird sometimes. It 91 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 360. 92 Washington Post, "Folklore Panel Warned to Stick to Amateurism," 8 May 1938. 93 Rosemary V.

Hatha way has suggested that "[w]e need to regard the uses of folklore and other traditional cultural materials in texts not as static sites of pure representation . . . but as places where culture and identity are actively constructed and contested."96 This is even more true in the context of performance. In an article on Hurston's work with the Federal Writers Project, David Kadlec focuses on how folklorics for Hurston was not "something to be documented but something to be done."97 The theatre was the space for this active project of making, doing, and constructing culture. Unfortu nately, the aims of folklore and theatre in the popular imagination were simply too dissimilar to accommodate Hurston's enterprise. According to Manganaro, "Hurston's version of 'traveling culture' would have been viewed as out of sync with the emer gent conception of culture, promoted by [Ruth] Benedict, as stationary, integrated, and configurational."98 In the few times when they were produced, Hurston's more or less straightforward reproductions of work songs?for example, as in the Cold Keener skit "Railroad Camp"?were often perceived as scholarly exercise rather than theatrical intervention; on the other hand, her staging of a Bahamanian fire dance became a signature and well-received finale to her original revue. Hurston's emphasis on theatre as a collective encounter with permeable boundaries was distinctive.99 It was so unusual, as we have seen, that it hindered Hurston's critical approval, then as now. Consequently, in 1940, despite his early interest in collaborating with her, Green ended up working with Richard Wright on a stage version of Wright's highly acclaimed novel, Native Son.100 And although Hurston contributed to producer Forbes Randolph's 1931 revue Fast and Furious, she was not surprised that it folded within a week and was poorly reviewed.101 In her quest to portray the range of black expression, Hurston was wary of false depictions or static representations. When she did manage to have her material or arrangements produced, it is difficult to discern how much control she actually had over the arrangements of her material. A version of the short skit, "Lawing and Jawing" (1931, from the collection of lost works), seems to have appeared in altered form in Randolph's Broadway revue. After its weeklong run Hurston wrote to Mason: "Godmother, they take all the life and soul out of everything and make it fit what their idea of Broadway should be like."102 Hurston 95 "Larry Neal Papers, 1961-1985/' in Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Division, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York City.

"This is not to say that Hurston's notion was purely original and without relation to other modern ist aesthetic projects; however, the way race played into this blurring of boundaries and the collective enterprise of the theatre were crucial variables that hindered Hurston's approval. 100 Boyd, Wrapped in Rainbows, 345. 101 Ibid., 225. 102 Hurston, letter, 14 August 1931, in Zora Neale Hurston, 224.</page><page sequence="19">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 55 claimed to have written the majority of the material for the revue, although a derisive review from the Wall Street Journal makes no mention of her; it does, however, say that the production was "more appropriate in a bygone day, [with] outworn minstrel comedy scenes including a typical courtroom sketch which certainly has never been surpassed for dullness."103 Nonetheless, Hurston continued to struggle for what she viewed as an authentic representation of black culture, made all the more potent by her idealized expectations for a participatory, embodied encounter between performer and spectator. It seems clear why Hurston's plays weren't performed during her lifetime, given the difficulties of a restrictive patron, associations between dialect and minstrelsy, the fraught reception of folklore and its vexed relationship to theatre, and the outright misappropriation of her materials. Despite these obstacles, she continued to pursue a career in the theatre by tapping into the connections she saw between her collected folklore and the radical potentials of the theatrical encounter. Hurston was indefati gable in her understanding of black expression as theatrical in and of itself and her commitment to presenting it as theatre. Theatre was the charged space within which Hurston sought to challenge what she viewed as a lack of authenticity in black aes thetic forms on Broadway. Reckoning with Cold Keener Cold Keener can be seen as a direct response to Hurston's struggles with fellow black artists and intellectuals. As a whole, this strange play reflects her belief that the the atre can provide an alternative, oral, and empowering encounter with black folkloric material. To this end, it includes dramatizations of work songs as in the eighth skit, "Railroad Camp," and everyday exchanges and incidents that take place everywhere, from a Southern gas station to a Harlem street corner.104 Upon first sight, because it is comprised of such assorted skits, Cold Keener seems to adhere to the familiar revue format. The relationships among the themes, the transitions between the skits, and, most importantly, the perspectival shifts between skits indicate that although it may look like a revue, it is most certainly one with unfamiliar, uncommon, and unrealized implications. In Cold Keener, Hurston addresses the following themes: the vitality and diversity of both ritual and everyday performance; the changing limits on verbal and sexual expres sion in the North and South, and in rural and urban environments; adult and childhood sexuality; relationships among artifice, truth, and lies; and, finally, the autonomy of black expressive forms coupled with the participatory potential for audience involve ment. I will address each of these themes below. Ultimately, Hurston's angular sense of drama amplifies key thematic and spatial contrasts, and, most importantly, allows for a fascinating possibility that could not be realized in any of her written works: in Cold Keener, she invites an audience of blacks and whites alike to inhabit and quite literally be embodied participants in the space of black performance. 103 Wall Street Journal, "The Theatre: A New Negro Revue," 17 September 1931. The free-standing skit "Lawing and Jawing" (1931) may be a version of the courtroom scene. A closer look reveals that it is hardly as dull or complicit with minstrel stereotypes as the reviewer suggests. 104 "Railroad Camp" is the one skit in Cold Keener that I do not analyze; it entails a straightforward rendition of a work song and is one such moment where Hurston privileges the autonomous repre sentation of black song.</page><page sequence="20">56 / Jennifer A. Cayer The first skit of Cold Keener, "Filling Station," announces Hurston's aim throughout: to privilege black expressive forms and ultimately create a space for a more fluid interaction between spectator and performer, without disavowing the limits of racial difference. Although "'representing the Negro race for whites' was in many ways the program of the Harlem Renaissance," Hurston's opening skit makes clear that this was not always the case.105 She boldly mixes both "insider" moments?with references clearly intended for a Southern or Northern, urban or rural black audience?with mo ments equally comprehensible to an audience unfamiliar with the songs, tales, and dialects of black folklore. The skit plays to both sides from the beginning, as it is literally set on the border between Alabama and Georgia at the appropriately named "State Line Filling Station." In these few pages of dialogue, Hurston dramatizes the divide between Chevy versus Ford owners, the kindness of Alabama versus Georgia residents toward blacks, and the status of lies versus the truth. Although discussing Hurston's memoir Dust Tracks on a Road, the critic Susan Willis could have been talking about this skit when she de scribes Hurston's efforts to "mediate two deeply polarized worlds whose terms include South /North, black/white, rural/urban, folk tradition/intellectual scholarship."106 Two customers drive up to the station and proceed to spar verbally along these binary divides. Through their argument, Hurston disrupts the fixity of these opposing terms altogether; specifically, a monolithic vision of the South is immediately disrupted by the highly charged state rivalry between the two patrons: Chevrolet Driver: (peaved) Lemme tell you something, coon. We got nice white folks in Georgy! But them Alabama red-necks is too mean to give God a honest prayer without snatchin' back amen! Ford Driver: Who mean? I know you ain't talkin' 'bout them white folks in my state. Alabama is the best state in de world. If you can't git along there, you can't get along nowhere. But in Georgy they hates niggers so bad till one day they lynched a black mule for kickin' a white one.107 Unlike Sterling Brown's accusation of "whitewashing" reality, the violent social con ditions of black life in both states are at once subsumed in humor and made plainly evident in the patrons' hyperbolic verbal competition.108 Even more disturbing, perhaps, is how the characters have internalized racism, so much so that they can only see it operating in the extreme, away and apart from their own everyday realities. Also in this opening skit we see a subtle indictment of artifice: it both acknowledges Hurston's notion of the "will to adorn" as "the second most notable characteristic in Negro expression," and rather slyly addresses many of the issues that Hurston faced as a struggling New York playwright.109 The Ford driver's car is described as dilapidated, except for a "very expensive and ornate cap on the radiator."110 After looking at it "from 105 Barbara Johnson, 'Thresholds of Difference: Structures of Address in Zora Neale Hurston/7 Critical Inquiry 12, no. 1 (1985): 278-89.

The indignant Ford driver insists that the car is good?conflating cap and car?and refuses the necessary overhaul. In addition to a humorous display of playing the dozens?from which car is fastest to which car God procured for his angels?upon closer look, the following passage reveals that Hurston is doing something incisive and quite political here.111 Within the more conventional and humorous riffs on the merits of Chevies or Fords, Alabama or Georgia, there is a serious commentary on the limits of black expression and the theatre: Ford Driver: Well, they tell me they don't 'low y'all niggers to laugh on de streets in Georgy. They got laughin' barrels on certain corners for niggers, and when you gets tickled you got to hold it till you can make it to one of them barrels and stick yo' head in. Then you can cut loose. Laughin' any old place just ain't allowed. Chevrolet Driver: Well, over in Alabama, if they tell a funny joke in the theatre, y'all ain't allowed to laugh till the white folks git through. Then a white man way down front turns 'round and look way up in the peanut gallery and say, "All right, niggers, y'all kin laugh now." Then y'all just "kah, kah"! Ford Driver: That's all right. They don't 'low y'all to ride no faster than ten miles an hour. If you ride any faster?you liable to get in front of some white folks.112 Whether on the streets or in the theatre, black laughter is transgressive and threat ening. It must be hidden from the public by the imaginative judicial institution of the laughing barrel; only a mediated form of laughter, sanctioned by the white audience, is acceptable in the theatre. Although the two men are comparing experiences in two Southern states, Hurston's own experiences in the New York theatre world are certainly echoed here. Even when she did manage to present her materials autono mously, it seems that Hurston often presented to segregated or all-white audiences.113 Purposefully targeting and taking the risk of alienating white audience members in this skit, she offers a pointed comment on the limits of black expression in the white dominated realm of the public arts. If played to a mixed audience, it is conceivable that this skit could elicit the reverse response: inviting, and thus allowing, the blacks in the audience to laugh first at the joke, while the white audience might bristle at the implications. This is possible, given Hurston's commitment to creating a space for black performance?on the part of both the performers and within the collectivity of the theatrical audience. "Filling Station" ends with the Chevy and Ford drivers threatening to kill each other, while the following skit, "Cock Robin," opens with the murder of its title character. As Hurston's stage directions state: "There is a sudden turmoil in the shack and three shots are heard. The door flies open and Cock Robin staggers out with three arrows sticking in him and falls dead on his back on the sidewalk. Crowds pour out of the doors."114 In turn, "Cock Robin" ends just as a funeral parade builds momentum, and 111 See Henry Louis Gates, The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of Afro-American Literary Criticism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), for a more detailed discussion of signifying and playing the dozens in the black tradition. 112 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 48. 113 For the 1932 performance of From Sun to Sun at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, the school's president stipulated that no blacks be allowed to occupy any of the 1,800 seats; see Boyd, Wrapped in Rainbows, 243. 114 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 55.</page><page sequence="22">58 / lennifer A. Cayer the following skit, "Heaven," opens at the closed pearly gates of heaven, aptly located at the intersection of Hallelujah Avenue and Amen Street. These abrupt thematic tran sitions between skits are not coincidental: the "angular" turns?from near murder to actual murder, from funeral rite to heaven's gates?form a productive dramatic tension between skits that lends Cold Keener coherence and scope. Whereas these transitions serve to provide dramatic continuity between the skits, the thematic relationship be tween two other skits proposes something quite different?and more subversive. Two skits in Cold Keener offer humorous indictments of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, which was in its heyday during the mid-1920s. In "Cock Robin," based on the eighteenth-century folk ballad, a community of ani mals?owls, beetles, jaybirds, flies, crows, wrens, blackbirds, and a bull, each a parody of a human behavior?all convene to decide how the funeral arrangements will be made for an adulterous and much-maligned bird. Crow suggests that the procession end conveniently at Speckled Hen's barbecue and fish-fry: "Why not let's have one grand consolidated, amalgamated fraternal parade down to her place and enjoy the consequences?"115 Bull, however, insists on leading the parade: Bull: I don't keer who gits the funeral. I'm going to march in front. Owl: How come, Brother Bull? You don't belong to none of these lodges. Bull: I know it, but, Brother Owl, you know very well that Bull goes in front of every thing. Owl: Dat's de truth . . .116 Bull "sets his hat at a reckless angle, seizes an elaborate baton and begins to line up the lodges. Then he places himself at the head. The owl brings up the rear."117 Bull's character, as self-proclaimed parade leader, is the animal embodiment of the US slang meaning of bull: a show of bravado, nonsense, or shallow self-aggrandizing fast-talk ing. And Owl, associated in the popular imagination with wisdom or the slow accrual of knowledge through learned experience, follows well behind. Although it is by no means explicit, Hurston may be offering a playful critique of Garvey's popular parades and spectacles. The self-appointed and ceremoniously adorned Bull is elided with Garvey's charismatic and carefully constructed public persona. In a chapter dedicated to Garvey's use of spectacle to garner mass appeal and mobilize his commercial and political interests, Krasner cites the ubiquity of the parade in 1920s Manhattan: "James Weldon Johnson called Harlem a 'parade ground,' in which parades were almost a constant presence."118 The theatricality of the parade "meant that everyone could watch as well as participate."119 In a sense, Garvey's mission for full participation seems similar to Hurston's; but the critical difference, and perhaps the source of Hurston's disdain, was his use of the theatrical as propaganda to bolster his own economic plans. Krasner suggests that "Garvey was seeking to manufacture symbols that would take hold in the minds and hearts of black people."120 Conversely, 115 Ibid., 59. 116 Ibid. 117 Ibid., 60. 118Krasner, A Beautiful Pageant, 172. 119 Ibid., 174. 120 Ibid., 186.</page><page sequence="23">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 59 Hurston was seeking to make visible the already existing symbols, rituals, myths, and oral traditions of a living and politically relevant folk culture that she saw as becoming invisible, even as they remained critical to her aspirations for a new theatrical form. In another of the lost plays, Hurston more directly challenges the promise of the back-to-Africa movement. Meet the Mamma, an experimental musical, stages the journey of a well-to-do Harlem hotel proprietor to Africa, with the hopes of reuniting with a rich uncle who has discovered a diamond mine in West Africa. It turns out that the hotel proprietor's pesky mother-in-law, who disapproves of her daughter's marriage, has come aboard the ocean liner with them and is the uncle's long-lost lover. Through out Hurston spoofs the promise of Africa versus that of the United States and New York City. Similar to Garvey, she acknowledged the primacy of an African heritage; however, she sought to integrate the African aesthetic tradition with the American and thus celebrate their co-presence in black language, styles, and song. This methodology resonates with her beliefs in a traveling and fluid culture, and sets her use of perfor mance apart from Garvey's. The skit "Cock Robin," recast from the old ballad and performed in the black South, is also a direct commentary on miscegenation. The cuckolded Sparrow begins to put two-and-two together: "When me and my wife first started to nestin' she never laid nothin' but plain white eggs. But since Cock Robin been hanging 'round our place every time I go out on a worm hunt, when I come back, she'll done laid another blue egg."121 Cock Robin is ultimately killed, not for committing adultery on an individual or familial level, but for communal reasons. Crow puts it most clearly: "When they get so they kin lay mo' eggs in my nest than I kin?they's got to be some changes made."122 Cock Robin dies because of his ambiguous status as the "Superior Subordinate Exalted Contaminator."123 Likewise, Hurston's personal views on Jim Crow laws in the South were, to say the least, contradictory. In the mid-1940s, her published views encouraged the repeal of separatist laws, but in the 1950s, she was adamantly opposed to public school desegregation. Because of this, the political commentary within "Cock Robin" could be read either way, both raising white anxieties about the threats of so-called black virility and acknowledging the brutal realities of rape in black slave history. This ambiguity may also speak to Hurston's desire to appeal to both white and black audiences and to not alienate any potential ticket-buyer. In either case, the Garveyesque Bull in "Cock Robin" heads up an ideologically empty parade, mobilized for pure entertainment and personal gain, neither to commemorate the death of a community member nor to celebrate the enactment of community justice. Given Hurston's strong views against the use of art as propaganda, Garvey's level of pomp for the purposes of self-promotion invites criticism. Another skit later in the play also offers a surreptitious political critique. The seventh skit, "Bahamas," offers a strange, vague, and incomplete riff on O'Neill's The Emperor Jones. Here, the figure of the Emperor Jones, as a pompous culture hero ready to embark on a re-colonization of Africa, is also likened to Garvey. The first three pages of Hurston's archived manuscript are marked with vague pencil cross-outs, making it even more difficult to discern whether this is truly a criticism or something else 121 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 56. 122 Ibid. 123 Ibid., 58.</page><page sequence="24">60 / Jennifer A. Cay er entirely. Characters, Joe and Good Black, are invited to join the emperor as he sets off for the Bahamas, and then onward to Africa. When they arrive in the Bahamas, the emperor?in all his regalia?is making a spirited and well-received speech. Although much of the latter part of the speech (beginning with "France") is scribbled over, here it is in its entirety: Emperor Jones: To Africa! When I get there with my conquering black legions I am not going to ask Great Britain what they are doing there. I'm just going to say "get out!" (Ap plause) I'm not going to ask France what are you doing here? I'm going to say "get out!" [...] Ninety days from now I shall have an ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburg. ("Hurrahl") Ninety days from now I shall have an ambassador at the court of Moscow. {Applause) And ninety days from now I shall have a Black House, side by side with the White House in Washington. {Great storm of applause) Board the fleet, let us sail for Africa and freedom!124 Unlike O'Neill's emperor, Hurston's is a regaled and celebrated guest, suggesting her complicity with the controversial notion promoted by Garvey and others of a separate country governed by and for African Americans. At the same time, there is also a satirical tone to the speech, indicative of an anti-colonialist critique. "Bahamas" ends with a rendition of Hurston's fire dance?an audience favorite made famous as the finale of her revue The Great Day. Here, she provides a commentary on the vitality and diversity of folk performance, as opposed to its invisibility or static representation on the "white" stage. In scene 1 of The Emperor Jones, O'Neill's emperor is confused by the distant drumming sounds and asks Smithers to explain: Smithers: [With a mean grin] For you. That means the bleedin' ceremony 'as started. I've 'eard it before and I knows. Jones: Cer'mony? What cer'mony? Smithers: The blacks is 'oldin' a bloody meetin', 'avin' a war dance, gettin' their courage worked up b'fore they starts after you.125 Similarly, in Hurston's version, a chorus of seamen sing and drum and a fire dance begins in honor of the emperor's arrival. The remainder of the scene, however, consists of detailed descriptions of singing, the dance itself, and fragments of Bahamanian songs from Hurston's own collections. The level of detail points to a critical distinc tion between the drums in O'Neill and in "Bahamas" that resonates with Hurston's relationship to folklore. In Hurston's version, the drummers begin, tune their drums, and change rhythms to go along with the song pieces and the emperor's accompanying bluesy ballads?far from the steadily pulsing, slowly accelerating "tom-tom" that O'Neill describes.126 Instead of a generalized and "primitive" account of tom-tom drums and a "'eathen religious service?makin' no end of devil spells and charms," Hurston situates the event within a particular time and place, revealing that it is the dynamic Bahamanian ritual performance of the fire dance. This skit offers a rendition of a specific cultural 124 Ibid., 90. 125 Eugene O'Neill, The Emperor Jones (New York: Modern Library, 1937), 23. 126 Ibid., 22.</page><page sequence="25">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 61 performance as an alternative to O'Neill's inauthentic, generic treatment of a primi tive ceremony.127 Here, Hurston also raises the question of participation. Early in the skit, before the drumming begins, a parade passes by. The character Good Black asks the emperor, "Can I get in it or is it just private?"128 The emperor encourages him to "Save it for tonight.... When night comes, we are holding a fire dance."129 Here, Hurston is again highlighting the emptiness of the parade (as in "Cock Robin") against the authenticity of participation in the fire dance. Good Black, she implies, should just sit back and watch the parade, but when night falls and the real event takes place, that is when it is time for Good Black?and, by extension, the audience?to join in. Let us now return to Cold Keener's third skit, "Heaven." Here, Hurston counters earthly justice, which seemingly favors the white man or woman, with a spiritual jus tice: unlike on Earth, in heaven the black man is regaled with angel wings and respect. She recasts in racial terms the biblical parable of the rich man getting into heaven as if through the eye of a needle. The use of biblical material was not unusual; during the 1920s, the Bible as a source of literary and theatrical material was a contested origin text for blacks and whites; for blacks, it was "the book of books" in which "Negroes found consolation for their pain and a hope for a better future."130 Conversely, it could also be interpreted to legitimize the existence of slavery, and "as Euro-America used it, exemplified as no other text did the planned divide between white power and black powerlessness, the engineered split between white literacy and black illiteracy."131 Hurston's skit offers the black man a promise of redemption in heaven, and again exemplifies her hyperbolic style. Whereas a benevolent white man is refused entry, his charity refunded, and the gates of heaven shut, the main character, Jim, a victim of the Johnstown Flood, meets Noah and dares to fly a bit too soon with his new angel wings and is gently admonished: Black Angel 1: Unh-hunh, I told you you was gointer git yo'self into all kinds of trouble flyuY so fast! Jim: Aw, I don't keer. Black Angel 2: Yeah, and now you ain't go no mo' wings neither. Jim: (Making ready to strike his harp) I don't keer. I was a flyin' fool when I had 'em. (Starts to play and sing)131 Similar to how "Cock Robin" explores domestic and social law, "Heaven" provides an alternate conception of the function of divine law. The limits and racial lines in public space are inverted in heaven; the suffering of the black man trumps the charitable benevolence of the white man when it comes to salvation. 127 These observations relating O'Neill to Hurston began in Martin Harries's graduate seminar, "Mod ern Drama" (2005) at New York University. I am grateful to Martin Harries for this and for subsequent conversations, recommendations, and editorial suggestions. 128 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 91. 129 Ibid. 130 Douglas, Terrible Honesty, 404. 131 Ibid. 132 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 65.</page><page sequence="26">62 / Jennifer A. Cayer The stage directions and style of the first three skits?"Filling Station," "Cock Robin," and "Heaven"?as well as in the seventh, "Bahamas," seem to require a conventional stage. These skits imply a clear distinction between the performance and the distanced spectators. Conversely, the fourth and sixth skits at the heart of the play, "Mr. Frog" and "House that Jack Built," offer provocative keys into the collective and embodied aspects of Hurston's angular vision of performance. I would like to foreground my analysis of the four remaining, and most central, skits with Hurston's description of her own participant-observer process of collecting songs. In audio recordings from the WPA Florida Folklife collection, Hurston per forms nearly twenty segments of workers', blues, children's, and Bahamanian songs. After her rendition of the jook song "Halimuhfack," she is asked to describe how she learned the song: I don't remember. I was in a big crowd. I learned it from the crowd. I just set in the crowd with the people if they singin' and I listen as best I can and I start to joinin' in with a phrase or two. Finally I got so I can sing a verse then I keep on till I learn all the songs and all the verses and then I sing 'em back to the people until they tell me that I can sing 'em just like them. Then I take part and I try it out on different people who already know the song until they are quite satisfied that I know it. Then I carry it in my memory.133 In "Characteristics," Hurston explains how mimicry is in and of itself an art form that is done for the love of it, rather than to be like the one imitated.134 There is a pleasure in repetition and, as evident in Hurston's description, in being a part of a crowd and in the shift from observation to participation. Mimicry for Hurston is not a challenge to originality: riffs on a theme and "the modification of ideas" constitute the original.135 Indeed, mimicry was one of her own ethnographic strategies for not only learning tunes, but also for blurring the line between observer and informer and rendering a song anew. In the following skits, she may be tapping into the inherent pleasures of mimicry by presenting songs that are familiar for some audience members, inviting them to sing along. The fourth skit, "Mr. Frog," is an enchanted musical reenactment of the children's song "Froggy-Went-a-Courtin.'" Humorously set in the time "when animals talked," Mr. Frog literally rides onto the stage atop a tortoise and marries Miss Mousie.136 The Florida swamp setting is alive with a young dancer who plays a pine tree, an anthropomorphic wind dance, a cake lit with fireflies, and a frog chorus. As the song progresses, the guests begin to approach the tree slowly, everybody throws rice, and the collective chorus continues singing and dancing to a slow curtain as the primary actors exit. Barbara Speisman equates Hurston's portrayal with a Disney movie: "Although Hurston portrays the scene with a child's whimsical imagination, 'Mr. Frog' could not possibly be staged in a practical way. The animal characters might be at home in a Walt Disney film, but a director would have a difficult challenge staging the skit."137 A large 133 Hurston's rendition of "Halimuhfack" can be found online in the Florida Folklife from the WPA Collections, Library of Congress, American Memory, http://memory.loc.gov, and on the CD accom panying Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Nellie Y. McKay, eds., The Norton Anthology of African American Literature (New York: W. W. Norton, 1997). 134 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 38. 135 Ibid. 136 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 66. 137 Speisman, "From Spears to The Great Day," 41.</page><page sequence="27">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 63 cast size, dancing trees, and actors dressed as frogs are certainly practical concerns that have hindered the play's production. But I argue that something else is at work here, having to do with the possibilities of embodiment. In the archival copy of the script, Hurston's first note states: "All action is seen from actors' viewpoint. Full Stage."1381 interpret this to mean that the audience is to experi ence the piece as participants, from the perspective of wedding guests. The other pos sibility is that the actors are part of the audience; in performance, the audience would be physically located together with the emerging, and ultimately gathered, chorus. The slow drawing of the curtain, also replicated at the finale of "Jook," indicates a delayed re-separation of the actors from the audience. Speisman diminishes the possibilities of performance altogether by suggesting that the skit would work better if adapted as a children's story. The difficulty of staging the skit according to Hurston's direction is tantamount to an infantile impossibility, one better relegated to the confines of the printed page. The potential of the audience being subsumed in the celebratory swamp song is dismissed as simple child's play. But the other possibility is far more intrigu ing: Hurston aimed to make the audience a living part of the play in all of its chaos. The anxieties of translating this skit from page to stage, compounded with the strange omission of this stage direction in the recent publication, are suggestive of Hurston's unique and difficult vision for the audience's encounter. Her unconventional staging in "Mr. Frog" suggests a desire to provoke a more embodied theatrical encounter with folkloric forms, akin to her own experience of learning "Halimuhfack." Whereas performer and spectator are conflated in "Mr. Frog," in "House that Jack Built," Hurston goes even further and the performer and the performed are provoca tively merged. Separated by one skit from "Mr. Frog," "House that Jack Built" suggests that Hurston's portrayals of childhood were not always fit for Disney. Here, the child characters are quite literally mimicking their adult counterparts. The skit opens with a Friday afternoon recitation session in a "Deep South" schoolhouse.139 The "aging man" teacher continuously flirts with, and inappropriately ogles his primary school students. The children, described as "large" and "pretty," also behave in overtly sexual ways.140 Asked to spell "cat," one student writes "pussy" on the blackboard.141 Another student performs a recitation: "When I was a lil boy the girls all call me cousin?now I'm a big man, I love 'em by the dozen."142 The students are learning how to spell, but ultimately they are learning what it means to be adults and thus to perform as men and women. After each of these awkward moments the teacher immediately turns his attention to the class scapegoat, DeOtis Blunt. The other students who don't opt out in fear or shyness perform their recited poems or song lyrics "stiffly."143 When it is finally DeOtis's 138 It is strange that this clear stage direction, unlike the other more vague cross-outs that riddle the archived scripts, is cut from the recently published collection. Given the editors' "Note on the Text," in From Luababa to Polk County, we can assume that this stage direction was eliminated in order for the skit "to conform to modern usage and production practices in order to facilitate their use in the classroom and the stage" (xvii). But this is especially odd, since the collection as a whole does not seem to take many editorial liberties. 139 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 80. 140 Ibid. 141 Ibid., 82. 142 Ibid. 143 Ibid.</page><page sequence="28">64 / Jennifer A. Cayer turn, he also tries to wriggle out of it by saying that somebody already performed his. After the teacher threatens him with a "real good killin,'" DeOtis approaches the platform somewhat uncomfortably.144 But soon after, he puts his hand on his hip and "is walking back and forth across the platform and gesturing."145 He performs the title song in its entirety, and soon all of the students and the teacher have left their seats and are dancing in unison. In a 1934 article, Hurston wrote that "who knows what fabulous cities of artistic concepts lie within the mind and language of some humble Negro boy or girl who has never heard of Ibsen."146 DeOtis's strange and unsettling performance offers a celebration of black performance on its own terms and most certainly exemplifies Hurston's claim. By the end of the skit, "DeOtis dances till he shudders down to the floor and lies there shivering in rhythm. Curtain."147 A reluctant performer, he is ultimately possessed by the rhythm of his own performance, which taps into and explodes the repressed sexual impulses that emerge and are squashed throughout the scene. He is at once the performer and, by the end, the performed. The successive progression of the song and the enthusiasm of his fellow classmates completely overcome him. The escalating and repressed sexual performances of both teacher and students culminate with DeOtis's quivering child body, collapsed after embodying the scene's taboo sexuality. Ultimately, instead of an innocent reenactment of a children's song, the young schoolboy performs a highly sexualized rendition of "House that Jack Built." These two opposed images of childhood, from the innocent to the erotic, occupy a single stage. In "House that Jack Built," Hurston shows how a performance can ignite a con tagious, and perhaps uncomfortable, shift from passivity to activity. Likewise, the theatre audience is not simply asked to watch and empathize or to accept the scene as mere representation. In her portrayal of the reluctant performer turned virtuoso performer, Hurston puts forward the hope for collective participation, as in her own participant-observer process of learning "Halimuhfack." Rather than presenting a static scene, Hurston's script holds the promise of recreating an encounter and the feeling of being a part of a singing, dancing, and performing crowd. Initially hesitant and disinterested, DeOtis becomes the center of attention because of his long, escalat ing, and rhythmic recitation in song. At the beginning he sulks, saying "Everybody is talkin' but me," but by the end he is a skilled solo performer who has everyone's rapt attention.148 His startling performance is in some sense a reclamation of sexual power: what begins as a routine recitation session becomes a sexually charged and contagious collective event. Hurston represents a spirited and powerful performance, collapsing the boundaries between performer and spectator and instigating another performance in the body of the audience. In between these two opposed performances of childhood is the skit "Lenox Avenue." With regard to staging, "Lenox Avenue" reestablishes a conventional stage, complete with a backdrop depicting an urban intersection and houses. The audience is once again reoriented outside of the staged action. In "Characteristics," Hurston describes 144 Ibid., 84. 145 Ibid. 146 In Robert E. Hemenway, Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1977), 206. 147 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 87. 148 Ibid., 81.</page><page sequence="29">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 65 the phenomenon of what might now be called cruising, or the subtle movements, body language, and acting-out that occur in public between mutually interested passersby; as she puts it, "These little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities."149 "Lenox Avenue" is a series of these everyday, miniature city plays. When a street preacher mounts the soapbox and begins to sing and sermonize on the sidewalk, an officer steps in and forces his followers to leave. A jilted young woman with a suitcase, followed by her husband, then enters in mid-argument. Despite the husband's attempts to ameliorate the situation, the young woman asserts: Lois: When you get home tonight, brother, I'll be spreading my jenk in another town. Man: Who with? Lois: You wouldn't know, but, baby, I'm going to throw him some waves the ocean ain't never seen.150 This interchange is bawdy and in full public view, without apology. Earlier in the skit, a middle-aged couple enters, arguing over the man's most recent infidelity: Woman: You big old evil mule you! You so evil till one drop of yo' spit would poison all the fish in the ocean. Hold on, I ain't through wid you yet! Man: You might as well be through. I'm through with you. I got a brand new costume that you don't fit. I'm playin' a brand new game and you ain't it. Bye, bye mama, you can't snore in my ear no more. Woman: (Slurringly) Don't put dat lie out, papa. You ain't near through wid me! Man: Woman, I'm just too through. You gimme the close up cramps every time I look at you.151 Amidst these impressive outbursts, there is still anxiety about what should and should not be performed in the public space; Man soon curtails their public argument: "Aw, come on and let's go home, woman. I hates to hear folks fussin' on the streets. [They exit right]/'152 Somewhat reminiscent of the laughing barrel in "Filling Station," Man feels ashamed of fighting in public and thus self-regulates his behavior. In this skit, Hurston shows how urban space is a kind of stage where individuals like the preacher perform, while others censor their individual expression. In contrast to DeOtis Blunt's disturbing yet commanding expression of child sexu ality, "Lenox Avenue" considers themes of adult gender and sex roles and how they are expressed and controlled in the streets of New York City, as opposed to the "Deep South" schoolhouse. Control comes in the form of the police officer, who repeatedly enters the scene as the urban symbol of orderliness. In his first entry, Officer calls out to a "very effeminate young man" carrying a bag: 149 Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," 32. 150 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 78-79. 151 Ibid., 75-76. 152 Ibid., 76.</page><page sequence="30">66 / Jennifer A. Cay er Officer: Come here. Young Man: (Looks all about himself) Are you speaking to me? Officer: Who else but you? Make it snappy!153 Officer proceeds to interrogate the man intrusively, but to no avail. Young Man has little more than knitting in his bag, and is heading into the army of all places: "Oh, well, the boys must have their sox, you know. [Waves a fluffy goodbye] Toodle-oo, old cabbage, I must try to get the boys out of the trenches before Christmas."154 Later in the same scene, two women enter arm-in-arm after two men comment on the scantiness of current clothing styles: First Man: Man, if these new styles keep on the way they're going, we'll find out that the snake's got hips. (She keeps right on off right) (Enter right two women. One is small and doll-like and the other is tall and masculine. They stroll across, arm in arm. At center they pause and whisper a moment, then stroll on across stage to exit at left. The two men glare behind them, then look at each other.) Second Man: Well, Bo, I still got this consolation?ain't nobody but a man and the Holy Ghost been the father of a family yet.155 In a quick beat, shock over revealing clothing styles is immediately escalated to shock at the female couple who literally perform a mutual "secret," via a deliberate whisper at center stage. Both of these mini-scenes, in an over-determined way, seem to describe in coded terms a gay male and lesbian couple. Similar to "House that Jack Built," these two segments imply that hetero-normative power, as embodied by the officer and the male onlookers, is useless against the urban flexibility to perform gender roles and relations.156 Sequentially juxtaposed in Cold Keener, "Lenox Avenue" and "House that Jack Built" provide a complex commentary on the limits and excesses of sexual expres sion across the divides of urban/rural, North/South, public/private, and adult/child. Prefaced by "Lenox Avenue," DeOtis's performance?and the fact that it is watched by his fellow classmates, who are stand-ins for Hurston's embedded spectator?is even more transgressive and sexually charged. Similar to the political commentary couched in the humor of "Filling Station," Lois, the young wife who is leaving her husband in the last scenario of "Lenox Avenue," humorously acknowledges the racial lines within the urban law. Hurston also shows how both sexuality and race can be performed. The scene closes with Lois further re jecting her husband and threatening to send him to jail if he continues to harass her: Man: How come I'm goin' to jail? Lois: Cause there's a cop right there on the corner and I'm going to holler like a pretty white woman!157 153 Ibid., 74. 154 Ibid., 75. 155 Ibid., 77. 156 See Boyd, Wrapped in Rainbows, for an account of the sexual licentiousness that characterized much of the Harlem Renaissance social scene in which Hurston took part. 157 Hurston, in From Luababa to Polk County, 79.</page><page sequence="31">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 67 In order to receive protection from the authorities, Lois must perform as if white, and perform she will. Here, Hurston's idea that race is at once theatrical and constituted by and in performance is made clear: by performing "as if" white, Lois is assured of getting the cop's attention right away. This could also be an insider moment, reflective of the fate of black performers on the white stage who seem to become whiter and whiter. Lois's proclaimed ability to perform as an "other" is directly related to Hurston's vision of the theatre as a space of encounter where boundaries between performer and spectator or the self and other are at turns confirmed, tested, and blurred. The final skit of Cold Keener, "Jook," is probably comprised of Hurston's shorter, less-developed, and lost skits, "Poker" and "Woofing"; similarly, Nunkie, the main character in "Jook," is also in the play Spunk. This kind of overlap occurs throughout Hurston's work and exemplifies her continual efforts to find the most appropriate venue or genre for a given story or situation. In "Jook," a card game starts up, along with escalating bets and death threats. Couples "slow-drag" on the dance floor and verses of "Let the Deal Go Down" are sung between segments of dialogue: Black Boy: Oh, wha evil have I done: Roll yo' hips?don't roll yo' eyes. Sack Daddy: Turn it on and let de bad luck happen?Shake yo' hips mama. Stack: Ten dollars for a whoop, six bits for a squall! If you can't shimmy, shake yo' head. Bunk: I hear you cacklin', mama, I know yo nest ain't far. Don't you vip another vop till I get in there.158 "Jook" consists of a folk performance built loosely around an atmospheric plot. The skit opens and closes with music; Nunkie is playing the piano, singing. Without a de finitive beginning or end, the skit's spontaneous, erotic, and celebratory event seems perpetually to unfold. Explicit about her curtain speeds?"John Henry and Ella Ward grabs a guitar . . . walks to the center of the stage . . . and begins to sing the verses to a slow curtain"?Hurston is keenly interested in the relationship between the audience and the spectacle. As in "Mr. Frog," the slow curtain speed indicates Hurston's desire for the audience to feel part of the collective character of the scene as possible onlookers and actual bodies in this living, breathing performance space. Then at another point within the scene, the singing becomes less spontaneous and more stylized, requiring the audience to withhold participation and simply watch. These sequential oscillations, from including to excluding the audience, enact the dynamics of her own ethnologic encounters. After all, Hurston herself constantly moved between observing folk culture and immersing herself in it. These perspectival shifts also illuminate her thematic concerns with the communal limits imposed on individual sexual and racial expression in spaces both urban and rural, domestic and divine. The audience cannot choose at any given moment to stand up and dance?Hurston must invite them. Here, as at other moments, she seems to want to remind the audience of the autonomy and artfulness of black expressive forms. We can participate, it seems, but we must also acknowledge the seriousness of the artistic endeavor. As the final skit, "Jook" provides the most complex example of Hurston's desire to both collapse and reestablish the boundaries among performer, performance, and spectator. Within 158Ibid., 111.</page><page sequence="32">68 / Jennifer A. Cayer this single skit, she conveys both the solo virtuosity of performance and invites the audience to participate in the collective, collaborative energy of the scene. It is through a truly distinctive angular structure?in terms of theme, space, and perspective?that Hurston is able to evoke and enact the subtleties of racial identity, difference, and performativity. Hurston's dramatic texts continue to elude deep critical engagement, and they still have not found their way to the stage.159 Perhaps the increased access that the published collection promises will inspire future performances: embodied engagements with her dramatic works that leap beyond the surface of the page toward the unknown, as yet unrealized theatrical encounter she sought to instigate. But before this day comes, there is still much we can learn from reading these plays. They offer an important historical site to examine how the politics and debates of representing African Americans during the 1920s persist in contemporary debates on the definition, cultural role, and stakes of black theatre and performance. Indeed, the 1991 world premiere of The Mule-Bone at the Ethel Barrymore The atre?belated by sixty years!?was surrounded by such heated debates. What is most interesting about the play's reviews is how similar their preoccupations and criticisms are to those of Hurston's own day. Gates states that the exclusive use of black ver nacular is the main reason why "a folk comedy about the residents of a small Florida town in the 1920s cause[s] such anxiety."160 This was also true for Spunk, George C. Wolfe's acclaimed 1990 adaptation of Hurston's short stories "Sweat," "Story in Harlem Slang," and "The Gilded Six Bits." In notes on the acting style for Spunk, he writes: "It is suggested that the rhythms of the dialect be played, instead of the dialect itself. A subtle but important distinction. The former will give you Zora. The latter, Amos and Andy."161 Attempts to mitigate the association between dialect and stereotypical images of black life persist. In other reviews of The Mule-Bone, critics wrote that the play is an "entertaining dip into African-Americana" and is "more folksy than folk," and much of the commentary declares Hurston to be an anthropologist first and fore most rather than a theatre practitioner.162 Many of the latter comments could easily have been pulled from either the 1930s or the 1990s and are indicative of how a more comprehensive assessment of Hurston's dramatic pursuits has been stalled, rather than integrated into such long-standing cultural debates.

Similar questions flared in the playwright August Wilson's 1996 speech, "The Ground on Which I Stand," and Robert Brustein's rebuttal in the New Republic, "Subsidized Separatism" vol. 215, no. 8-9 (August 1996): 39-42. Wilson, a self-identified "race man," passionately called for a r??valuation of the funding and commitment to black theatre. Echoing Hurston in the 1920s, Wilson said: "I will tell you that Black Theater in America is alive ... it is vibrant ... it is vital ... it just isn't funded"; see Wilson, "The Ground on Which I Stand," Callaloo 20, no. 3 (1997): 493-503. Although Hurston is not directly aligned with Wilson, the uncanny contemporary reiteration of her ideas speak to how Hurston's work in the theatre must be included as a vital progenitor to our consideration of the possibilities that her theater holds for explor ing the evolving relationship between race and representation.</page><page sequence="33">ANGULARITY AND EMBODIED SPECTATORSHIP IN COLD KEENER / 69 served professional titles Hurston must be considered a playwright as well; given her lifelong commitment to working in the theatre, the special care she took to preserve her collection of plays, and their innovative theatrical interventions. In these pages, I have proposed a few ways to think about Hurston's theatrical work in relation to her novels, folklore collections, and essays. Theatre is an under-acknowl edged yet entirely compatible realm of Hurston's life work. Many of the scholarly insights raised in relation to her works of folklore and fiction resonate in compelling ways with Cold Keener. In particular, Cold Keener exemplifies Hurston's under-explored and crucial use of the concept of angularity. This structure accommodated multiple and fractured glimpses of urban and rural space along with an array of folk themes. Most importantly, the angular structure also operated on the level of the spectator's engagement with and within the performance. Addressing her work to black and white audiences alike, Hurston both features autonomous performance and invites the audience to become an embodied and engaged part of the communal drama. Theatre, as the space of performance, was the premier genre for Hurston to showcase contem porary folkloric forms, and even more importantly, to recreate a participant-observer dynamic. Embodiment operates on two levels in Hurston's work: as the embodiment in performance of "authentic" black expression on the part of performers (as in DeOtis's possessed and commanding performance), and as the incorporation or embodiment by the audience of the communal aspects of black song and performance (as including spectators as wedding guests in "Mr. Frog"). Hurston plays with precarious issues of identification in the theatre, thus making the desires, problems, risks, and challenges of identifying as it relates to race a shifting and overt part of the theatrical encounter. These issues were certainly at the forefront of her work as an anthropologist. Theatrical performance was the methodology that best suited Hurston's burgeoning ideas and explorations of race as performative and culture as a fluid process of engagement. It would seem that then as now, the affirma tion of racial boundaries and the potential momentary traversal of such boundaries within the theatrical encounter are fraught and charged possibilities. It is no wonder that Hurston, as the so-called lightening rod of the Harlem Renaissance, pursued such risky territory in her dramatic endeavors. For this reason alone, her innovative work as a theatre artist merits inclusion, even if it is an uncomfortable fit, in contemporary genealogies of race, performance, and US theatre history.</page></plain_text>
