ISLE seeks to encourage such scholarship, writing, and teaching, while facilitating the development of a theoretical foundation for these activities. It also seeks to bridge the gaps between scholars, artists, students, and the public.

Chelly it Rock of Strom have is the a Reflections on Canyon de Chelly Text by Laura Tohe Photographs by Stephen E. Strom To visitors it is Canyon de Chelly, a scenic wonder of the Southwest, but to the Dine, it is Tséyi', "the place deep in the rock," a site that many have long called home. Now from deep in the heart of the Dine homeland comes an extraordinary book, a sensitive merging of words and images that reflects the sublime spirit of Canyon de Chelly. Dine poet Laura Tohe draws deeply on her heritage to create lyrical writings that are rooted in the canyon but universal in spirit, while photographer Stephen Strom captures images that reveal the very soul of this ancient place. "Reading this book is like being taken on a journey through a beautiful place by a friend who shows us the significance of each stone or river bend. . . . Poems and photos work together to become a portrait not just of place but of human connec- tion to the land." - Lisa D.

Susan Tweit describes the Valley's natural features and traces its human history, while photographer Glenn Oakley portrays not only the subtle beauty of this high-desert sanctuary but also the grandeur of the cranes in flight.

John Stilgoe is a wonderful writer, and here he distills a lifetime of insights based on his acute observations of and passionate caring for North America 's land- scapes, and the vast changes we have made in them over the past few cen- turies.

The result is an insightful and thoughtful narrative that takes the reader on a historical, geographical, idea-filled excursion, a journey that reaps rich rewards because of Vale's ability to think about things in fresh, clear ways."- William Wyckoff $45.00 cloth Design with Culture Claiming America's Landscape Heritage Edited by Charles A. Birnbaum and Mary V. Hughes "This anthology, written by a number of distinguished schol- ars, breaks new ground in focusing on a major, yet generally neglected, chapter in the legacy of landscape architectural practice in the United States. Equally important, the content addresses a long overlooked aspect of the historic preservation movement, bringing home the importance of knowing that movement's past in the pursuit of high professional standards today.
