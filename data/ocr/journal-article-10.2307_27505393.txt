<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 16, No. 2, 1977 Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth LUCY BREGMAN I must maintain my . . . ideas of God's incapacity to understand the living human being as an organism in the circumstances contrary to the Order of the World which arose from nerve-contact being established with one single human being, namely myself. . . God, who under normal circumstances maintained contact only with souls and with corpses? in order to draw up their nerves?completely misunderstands the needs of an actually living body . . . and thinks He can force upon me the souls' mode of thinking and feeling, their language etc. and demand from me a continual enjoyment or continual thinking.1 The author of these words is Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud read his autobiogra phy, Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, from which this passage was taken, and from it developed a psychoanalytic theory of paranoia. Due to Freud's prestige, his "Psychoanalytic Notes upon an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)" has influenced generations of psychoanalysts and others attempting to understand severe mental illness. Recently, certain critics of Freud have used the Schreber case to present alternative theories about the genesis and nature of paranoid schizophrenia, while others have sought to defend Freud's view through additional historical research on Schre ber and his family. But Daniel Paul Schreber's autobiography has often been overlooked in these efforts. Schreber's own motive for describing his experiences was not to become a famous case history, but?as might be guessed from the quoted passage?to inform the world of new and important religious truths. His more immediate goal was to regain his lost civil rights, and eventually secure his release from Sonnenstein Asylum. Starting with Freud, psychoanalysts and psychiatrists have translated the language of God in the Memoirs into language of father and Oedipus complex. It has thus been an important addition to the psychology of religion. As Philip Rieff comments, "To be religious, as Freud sees it in telling exaggeration here, is to be passive, compliant, dependent?all are essentially feminine traits."2 This particular formulation holds only if one reads Freud's case study without referring back to the Memoirs, which is exactly what many Lucy Bregman, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Religion at Temple University, Philadelphia. Articles of hers have appeared in the Journal of Religion, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, and Review of Religious Research. 119</page><page sequence="2">120 Journal of Religion and Health followers of Freud have done. Even the anti-Freudians have continued to read "father" for "God," and to assume that the "religious" language is a code that conceals something more basic and authentic. I feel that the automatic reduction of religious to psychological language is unjustified as a method of interpreting religious texts. Schreber's Memoirs was a religious text before it became a case history, and the ground gained by Otto and Eliade in marking out a space for religious language ought to be solid and broad enough to allow Schreber to stand on it, too. Few of Schreber's inter preters and none of his turn-of-the-century contemporaries doubted that he was mad, insane, mentally ill, or whatever other term their conceptual schemes supplied. In other words, he was quite as crazy as he was religious. But I think both these perspectives on his Memoirs should be taken seriously. My first reason is that the religious ideas of the Memoirs are extremely interesting, in contrast to ordinary late nineteenth century religious beliefs and ordinary atheism from the same period. Schreber, whose case is unique, does not speak for "all schizophrenics," nor should he be made to do so. His religious system is therefore not simply an instance of some general category of "schizo phrenic religious delusions." As a religious system, it is on one level bizarre, gloomy, and utterly unbelievable; on another level it can be seen as a compelling expression of weakness inherent in God as Authority and salvation attributed to God as Eros. Of the interpreters, only Anthony Wilden seems to have discovered this side of Schreber; his superb treatment of the case makes the present analysis much easier. Someone else at least has seen Schreber as standing among "the great mystics and great Utopian socialist philosophers" ?or at least standing in some other relation to us than as schizophrenic and case history. One suspects that other interpreters, including Macalpine and Hunter, who carefully translated the Memoirs into English, may have experienced the same fascination with Schreber, but transformed it into new observations on his case. A second reason for exploring the Schreber autobiography as a religious document is to shed some light on the category of "personal myth" or "personal religion," which has received a good deal of attention lately through the notion of "story." This perspective sees "religion" as the emergent meaning system in one's own life history. The psychologist Carl Jung used the term "personal myth" to describe what he had written into his autobiography. Rather, "per sonal myth" was what had expressed itself throughout Jung's life, including his postumously-published autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections.3 Auto biography writing is storytelling. Yet writing one's personal experiences in some sense creates the past and thus the storyteller as well. If this was true for Jung's "personal myth," it may well have been true for the author of Memoirs of My Nervous Illness. If Schreber's book is indeed a "personal myth," then the Schreber volume can add to what is currently being done to explore autobiogra phy as a vehicle for theological reflection. Or perhaps one can, through Schre ber's work, discover the idiosyncratic limit of "personal myth." Is "personal myth" meant to be the subjective, life history side of anyone's religion, however conventional? Or should one make "personal religion" synonymous with "unaffi</page><page sequence="3">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 121 liated with any religious institution or tradition"? In other words, people who believe in God send religious greeting cards, but don't go to church any more? It is an interesting sociological fact that there are probably a large number of people currently in this situation, but is this all that the concept of "personal myth" intends? At the very least, "personal myth" seems to imply a potential for creativity at the individual level, even if this may be developed in bizarre directions. Current use of "story" and "personal narrative" does not seem to deal with this question. My third reason for looking at Schreber is to say something about the vitality and possibility of religious language itself. From Freud's point of view, reading "father" for "god" in deciphering the Memoirs may have been justified. But Schreber did not write a book about his love and hate for his father, and (for whatever reasons) did write a book about God and the Order of the World. He received from his culture a certain set of categories for thinking and speaking about God, but these were not adequate for his experiencing God. The Schreber ian theology, which fills the Memoirs, is a mixture of traditional religious language, terms he claims to have learned from the "root language" used by dead souls who constitute God's substance, and ideas that seem to come from what Schreber knew of comparative religion. But the result is most definitely not schizophrenic "word salad." Nor, from our point of view 75 years later, does the work sound terribly "paranoid," although Freud focused on Schreber's sense of persecution. The cosmic plot against Schreber's manhood and sanity is not the final word in the Memoirs. Perhaps, too, we are now so used to plots and conspiracies revealed by reputable sources that this aspect of Schreber's myth seems mild in contrast, or much less striking than it did to Freud. What remains central to the Memoirs is the importance of the theological material, without which the life history cannot be ordered by its author. Paul Ricoeur refers to Schreber's God as a "caricature" of God, and asks if the genesis of this caricature "reveals the complete secret of 'the forces that con struct religions' "4 as Freud expected it would. Certainly, Schreber's religious system may not tell us everything about mainstream religion, but there is little reason to call it a caricature of the latter. Freud himself knew better, when he used Schreber's own notion of God's nerve fibers to illustrate the process that he, Freud, wrote about as "libidinal cathexes." As Freud put it: It remains for the future to decide whether there is more delusion in my theory than I should like to admit, or whether there is more truth in Schreber's delusion than other people are as yet prepared to believe.5 No one has definitively closed off either of these possibilities. Freud on Schreber: desire for the father Freud's interpretation of the Schreber material is probably the best starting point for our investigation, if only because it has dominated all other ap proaches. As I have already indicated, Freud was struck by the persecution</page><page sequence="4">122 Journal of Religion and Health theme of the Memoirs. During his illness, which began in 1890, Schreber was convinced that the soul of his first doctor, Dr. Flechsig, was engaged in exploit ing and tormenting him. He traced the problem back to an original case of "soul murder" perpetrated by the ancestors of Dr. Flechsig. He explained "soul murder" in reference to the idea found in folklore that "it is somehow possible to take possession of another person's soul in order to prolong one's life at another soul's expense,"6 but the concept remains obscure. Schreber included a chapter on his family as evidence for the presumed soul murder, but this chapter was omitted as "unfit for publication" and has never been recovered. Dr. Flechsig had been Schreber's physician during a previous illness in 1885, which had lasted only about six months. It was during his second and major illness that Flechsig became a persecutor and "supernatural" events occurred. By the time Schreber had completed his Memoirs (in 1901), he had already recognized that Flechsig the man may not have been the persecutor; it was the "Flechsig-soul," divided into 60 or so parts, that had been responsible. Schreber admits that ordinarily "souls" act autonomously only after the death of the person whose identity they preserve, yet Flechsig is still very much alive. This knowledge made it possible for Schreber, by 1901, to write in good conscience, "I do not harbor any personal grievance against any person. My aim is solely to further knowledge of truth in a vital field, that of religion."7 And by this time, "God" had taken over some of the role assigned to Flechsig, at least according to Freud. The nature of the persecution and its relation to Schreber's sexuality were far more interesting to Freud. Schreber believed he was to be "unmanned," trans formed into a woman. This change was necessary in order to restore the Order of the World. Now according to Freud, The idea of being transformed into a woman (that is, of being emasculated) was the primary delusion, that he began by regarding that act as a piece of persecution and a serious injury. . . . There can be no doubt, moreover, that originally he believed that the emasculation was to be effected for the purpose of sexual abuse and not so as to serve some higher design.8 In the next sentence, Freud has already relegated the religious delusion to the realm of the secondary; he gives primacy to the sexual delusion. We should notice three things about this presentation of Schreber's belief. First, Freud separates the "Redeemer" fantasy from the sex-change theme, seeing the former as conventional, the latter as really interesting. Thus two ideas that for Schreber belonged together were split apart by Freud. Second, Schreber's term "unmanning" has been translated into "emasculation;" the difference between becoming a woman-^ for Schreber, a positive goal ?and being castrated has been overlooked. This is where several alternative inter preters begin to demolish Freud's explanation of the delusion. The third point is that Freud has some evidence for his belief in the primacy of the sexual delusion. Schreber remembered that shortly before his second illness he was lying in bed half awake when he had the idea "that it really must be rather pleasant to be a woman succumbing to intercourse."9 He interprets this in the context of the Memoirs as evidence that "some external influences" were already</page><page sequence="5">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 123 at work in him. Freud sees this memory as evidence that the delusional system in its various stages was a defense against the wish to engage in passive homosexual relations. Freud's interpretation suggests that Flechsig the physician was the object of their desire, but was replaced by God who demands the "unmanning" of Schre ber. Only because God so orders it does Schreber comply. He felt his body gradually being changed into a female body and believed it his duty to aid and accelerate this process. The consequence of the unmanning was to be "fertiliza tion by divine rays for the purpose of creating new human beings." Recognizing the divine rather than human purpose to his transformation, Schreber wrote: Since then, I have wholeheartedly inscribed the cultivation of femininity on my banner, and I will continue to do so as far as consideration of my environment allows, whatever other people who are ignorant of the supernatural reasons may think of me.10 Freud noted that the only action Schreber took in regard to any of his beliefs was a modified kind of transvestitism, in private. For Freud, the important question was, to whom was this wish to be a woman originally directed? He sought the answer in Schreber's childhood fantasy of homosexual yearning for his father, the "passive Oedipus Complex." Both Dr. Flechsig and God are substitutes for the father, and the "same mixture of reverent submission and mutinous insub ordination"11 that characterizes Schreber's relationships with Flechsig and God is typical of the attitude of small boys toward their fathers. Freud notes that Schreber's father, Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber, was a distinguished physi cian and a suitable subject for transformation into a God.12 Since Freud was limiting himself to the text of the Memoirs, it remained for other researchers, particularly Niederland, to rediscover the truth about this distinguished father and potential God. Freud notices that although Dr. Flechsig is almost purely persecutor, "God" in the Memoirs is not the all-powerful, all-beneficent Being of traditional religion. "Mutinous insubordination" does account for some of the peculiarities of Schre ber's God; for instance, God is not only ignorant of living human beings, but "Every attempt at an educative influence directed outwards must be given up as hopeless."13 God was competent only when dealing with the dead, with corpses (quite a criticism if one's father was a physician, as Freud noted). Nevertheless in their final form, Schreber upholds God's desires and the Order of the World. In his discussion of paranoia, Freud describes the collapse of the world for the paranoid, signifying that an internal catastrophe has been projected onto exter nal reality. He quotes from Faust lines that go: Woe! Woe! Thou hast destroyed it, The beautiful world . . . Mighty among the sons of earth, More splendid Build it again, Build it up in thy bosom</page><page sequence="6">124 Journal of Religion and Health And then he says: And the paranoid builds it up again, not more splendid, it is true, but at least so that he can once more live in it. He builds it up by the work of his delusions. The delusion formation, which we take to be a pathological product, is in reality an attempt at recovery, a process of reconstruction.14 But there Freud stops. The reconstruction is only for Schreber, not for us. With the exception of Freud's hint at the end of the essay about "delusion" in his own theory, Schreber's recovery made sense only to Schreber and therefore says nothing to anyone else. Niederland and Schatzman: the persecuting father We know very little about Daniel Paul Schreber except what the Memoirs tell us. He had a distinguished career as a jurist until his illness. His post of Senatespr?sident meant that he presided over a panel of judges in the Supreme Court of Saxony. We also know that he came from a distinguished family, including the father-physician whom Freud mentioned. William Niederland learned that Schreber was released from the asylum in 1903, was readmitted in November 1907, and died in an asylum in 1911, aged 68.15 Schreber was born in 1842, and so of the first 50 years of his life we have little direct information. He was happily married, he tells us in the Memoirs, but his marriage was childless. We can only assume that Daniel Paul Schreber, when sane, was intelligent, morally upright, hard working and thoroughly uninteresting in contrast to the author of the Memoirs. But fortunately, there is another source of information about him, not hidden away in old documents but public, in print. Schreber's father, Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber, was an author as well as a physician, having published many works on health, raising children, exercise, diet, etc. In these works he outlined an entire system of child-raising that he claimed to have tried out (successfully) in his own family. How "successful" was this method? One son, Schreber's older brother, committed suicide; one of his sisters became "mentally not quite right" toward the end of her life; and the father himself may have spent the last few years of his life in the same condition. Daniel Paul Schreber, the second son, went on to become a famous psychotic. There is no doubt that the father's system of education as presented in his books had something to contribute to this grim record. And yet these books were mid-nineteenth century best sellers, running into many editions. It is this contrast between the psychotic son, famous as a case-history, and the respected father that drove Morton Schatzman, an advocate of Bateson's and Laing's views on schizophrenia, to write Soul Murder. In this ideological diatribe on "persecution in the family," Schatzman presents Schreber the son as the innocent victim of a bizarre and sadistic set of procedures perpetrated on him in childhood by a man whose ideas found their natural fulfillment among twentieth-century Nazis. Schreber Senior believed in discipline, obedience to</page><page sequence="7">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 125 authority, and rooting out and destroying the "weeds" from "the noble seeds of human nature." This weeding was done "ruthlessly and vigorously," beginning as soon as the child was born.16 These beliefs may have been shared by most of Dr. Schreber's contemporaries, but his own edition of them was thorough and took extreme forms. Describing children of one year and under, Dr. Schreber wrote: Our entire effect on the direction of the child's will at this time will consist in accustoming it to absolute obedience. The thought should never even occur to the child that his will could be in control. . . There is then joined to the feeling of law a feeling of impossibility of struggling against the law; a child's obedience, the basic condition for all further education, is thus solidly founded for the time to come.17 And so on. Dr. Schreber the educator sounds something like Hans Luther, Martin's father, in Erikson's Young Man Luther; Hans's principle characteristic is moralistic brutality. The difference is that Erikson's Hans is a mythic con struction; Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber speaks for himself, and his brutality was systematic and disguised by the terms "scientific" and "educational." Schreber's father's educational system included the use of a number of devices invented by him: belts to keep children from twisting and turning while in bed; metal rods to keep them from slouching; and a helmet to keep the skull and jaws straight. As Niederland puts it: Although the authoritarian regimentation of children with its emphasis on coercive disciplinary measures was probably typical of the country and era in which Dr. Schreber lived, it is a matter of record that the straps, belts and other forms of mechanical restraint were his personal inventions.18 The physical sensations of these restraints and the intolerable pressure caused by the devices were augmented by the detailed, omnipresent observation of his body and his behavior by his father. This information on Schreber's childhood training helps interpret the most bizarre part of the Memoirs, the "miracles." The author of the Memoirs experi enced many "miracles" worked by God on his body. Most of these are unpleasant and almost all of them are pointless, demonstrating the inability of God to cope with living beings. Only those miracles connected to his unmanning were in consonance with the Order of the World. The other, more threatening and unpleasant, miracles included the absorption of his lungs into his chest, the "compression-of-the-chest" miracle, putrefaction of his abdomen, and attacks on his head, "the effect of which was that my skull was repeatedly sawn asunder in various directions."19 Sometimes his stomach would be removed by miracle, and so, "food and drink taken simply poured into the abdominal cavity and into the thighs, a process which however unbelievable it may sound, was beyond all doubt for me as I distinctly remember the sensation."20 Niederlande and Schatz man's researches show that some of these "miracles" may well be disguised memories of real occurrences, namely, the sufferings experienced under his</page><page sequence="8">126 Journal of Religion and Health father's mechanical devices. In the Memoirs, souls and "rays" listen to, and write down, everything the author says and thinks. There is also the remark about God being impossible to educate?an interesting comment from a victim of the father's system. For Schatzman, Schreber is not only the victim; he is a victim who cannot name his persecutor. The child, in Dr. Schreber's system, is systematically persuaded to accept the parent's definition of reality, and so the very possibility of outright disobedience is never considered. Yet somehow the child knows he is being coerced, that something is being done to him. Schreber the son never connected the "miracles" and the "unmanning" with his father. Flechsig and God exploited and abused him, and he could eloquently describe his sufferings at their hands. But the father remains unnamed, although Schatzman is convinced that he was the true persecutor. As he states it, "A feature of 'soul murder,' it seems, was forbidding the victim to identify his murderer correctly."21 Incidentally, the reader may have wondered why a view that sees the schizo phrenic as a labelled victim rather than as "mentally ill" (the Bateson-Laing position) ends up producing a full-fledged villain who is labelled "persecutor." Niederland, no more approving of Dr. Schreber's educational philosophy, is also willing to allow that the father himself suffered, as well as inflicted suffering on others. Toward the end of the father's life, he received a blow on the head that produced strange changes in his character,22 and so, in the end, his family saw him vulnerable rather than omnipotent. To complicate the picture, there is no direct evidence that his children hated him. One of his daughters remembered how everything in the Schreber home was "oriented toward God" (Gottwarts gerichted) and how "All this was finished with the sudden death of our beloved father . . . our childhood Paradise was destroyed."23 If we allow for the same mystification that confused her brother, and also for family solidarity, it still seems as if Schreber, Senior, left a more complex legacy than Schatzman's portrait would allow. This complexity means that Schreber's relations with God and the Order of the World may be equally complex. Schatzman closes his book with an impassioned plea to the reader to: Presume in all cases of "paranoia" in which no intoxication or organic disease is present, that the person who feels persecuted is responding to behavior, past or present, of other people who are or have been near him. Starting from this point, invite everyone in his social situation to search for the origins of his feelings of persecution.24 However challenging the result may be, Schatzman ignores the substance of Schreber's own solution to the persecutions he undergoes. Schatzman is not concerned with God or the Order of the World; he is concerned with the right order betwen parents and children. Schreber becomes an occasion for examining this order when it is wrong, but Schatzman does not take Schreber's own answer seriously. This is unsettling, since the view Schatzman holds would seem to be ideal for listening to the mad, labelled "ill" person to find out how the world looks to him.</page><page sequence="9">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 127 Macalpine and Hunter: creatix and new birth It was not until 1955 that an English translation of the Memoirs appeared. Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter not only translated, but provided commentary and an interpretation of their own. They also included the legal documents from Schreber's battle to regain his civil rights as a competent adult citizen. They question Freud's interpretation of the case. First, they stress Freud's unfamil iarity with psychotics, saying that hence his analysis of Schreber's conflicts is based on material borrowed from the psychopathology of neurotic patients. Allowing that "neurosis" and "psychosis" may not be absolutely different, the "repressed homosexuality" Freud attributed to Schreber took a far different form from that seen in Freud's own patients, none of whom ever doubted his gender identity in a conscious way. Schreber, according to his translators, had conflicts so severe that a "genital level" approach to them is inadequate. Secondly, they insist that turning into a woman is not the same as castration. For Freud, "unmanning" meant "emasculation;" for Freudian theory there is no difference, in the child's eyes, between a woman and a castrated man. But his negative definition of "woman" is unsatisfactory to Macalpine and Hunter, who see "woman" as the being with the womb, the creatrix. This, they say, is what the childless, middle-aged Schreber was attempting to become; ** not a castrated man, but a woman who could be fertilized and give birth to "a new race of human beings from the spirit of Schreber."26 The Memoirs are indeed filled with references to birth and creation, from the creation by God of worlds and planets to the spontaneous generation of insects. But the ultimate creation is, in this view, the "new birth" of Schreber himself, whose entire personality structure must be recreated out of the ruins of his previous identity. What Macalpine and Hunter term "pregnancy fantasies" are linked by them to Schreber's experiences of "miraculous" damage to his stomach, lungs, etc.27 Both sets of phenomena show the fundamental threat to his ego and the preoccupation with themes of death and rebirth. These themes, which appear often in the fantasies of pro foundly disturbed persons, seem to point toward some universal and drastic process that Freud's level of analysis leaves in the dark. We should mention here that the acrimony generated by Freud's notion of women as penisless men seems to play only a minor role in Macalpine's and Hunter's view. Following Juliet Mitchell, we can say that Freud may have tried to describe what, in Western culture, a little boy's and a little girl's ideas about a woman are. He was not trying to establish what ought to be the case or even what women "naturall/' were predisposed to be. At this level, it looks as if writers such as Macalpine and Hunter are suggesting that another set of ideas about woman exists and that it may be more important than the idea that woman is a castrated man. This second set of ideas, centered on woman-as womb, gives rise to all sorts of repressed envious fantasies in men not nearly so psychotic as Schreber. However, the dead-end search for what is "natural" to womanhood has confused the level at which both sets of answers apply. Besides it is still relevant to ask if Schreber's own notion of becoming a woman really corresponds to either castration or pregnancy.</page><page sequence="10">128 Journal of Religion and Health What Macalpine and Hunter suggest is that Schreber's over-all vision of destruction and renewal is the most important theme of the Memoirs. This links Schreber's religious thought with a rich background of mythological representa tions of death and renewal, of chaos and cosmos. To say that these themes are common among certain types of schizophrenics is to suggest, as others have done, that schizophrenia can occasionally be a religious process. Anton Boisen's Exploration of the Inner World argues this position.28 This position does full justice to the "cosmic" scope of the Afemo?rs,which is evenly divided between accounts of Schreber's personal experiences and their theological, universal meanings. Whatever the differences between such a view and Schreber's own standpoint, we may also see both as challenging the simple equation of feminin ity, passivity, and religion suggested by Rieff, Freud's champion. Wilden: Schreber as social philosopher of liberation All of the interpreters whose thoughts on Schreber I have reviewed were fascinated by the man, his book, and his history. But all of them listened to him as a case history whose significance lay in his sufferings, not in his solution. This, says Anthony Wilden, is a mistake, because Schreber has something more to say if only we can listen. In this view, "the alienated 'patient' often makes greater contributions than do his commentators."29 According to Wilden, Schre ber discovered a new way to be a human being, so overcoming the culturally determined "opposition" between male and female in a sense that Freud and his revisionist critics did not. If we can present Wilden's view and make it credible, then we can go on to suggest that Schreber also discovered a way to be religious that was just as far beyond the kind of religiousness that his contemporaries and interpreters understood. Wilden's particular interest in the Schreber material is fairly clear: how has psychoanalysis incorporated Western culture and its exploitations into its dis course? To what extent has the "phallus," a symbolic relation, been confused with the physical sex organ, an entity?30 His answer is that even in a sophisti cated reinterpreting of Freud, such as Lacan's structural-linguistic one, this confusion is perpetuated. To stop talking about "castration" and start talking about "womb-envy" is to continue the confusion of levels of discourse, the confusion between the psychic or societal individual and the biological orga nism.31 What can Schreber, considered as "social philosopher," not as mental patient, contribute to this issue? Wilden relies on Bateson's notion of communication and metacommunication. The latter is a message about other messages, a commen tary (often obscure) on the language that is being used by the speaker. Schreber as a madman communicates messages of a consistently Manichean pattern. Male and female, pure and impure souls are carefully distinguished. Even God is split into a lower God, Ariman, and an upper God, Ormuzd,32 as well as into "posterior" and "anterior" realms of God. Human beings are divided by races: Germans, Persians, etc., following oppositions current in Schreber's culture. But, says Wilden, Schreber is also engaged in "metacommunication" about</page><page sequence="11">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 129 these same oppositions and is trying desperately to speak a language that overcomes them. This is particularly true of Schreber's own account of what it means to turn into a woman. The key to this is Schreber's own view of "woman," which hinges on the term Wollust, used profusely throughout the book. Freud and others understood this as "voluptuousness." Schreber cultivated Wollust in order to hasten his transfor mation and also wrote of "soul-voluptuousness." Schreber believed that a woman's body is covered with "nerves of voluptuousness," in contrast to the male body, in which these nerves are restricted to the genitals.33 Thus turning into a woman meant becoming a totally "voluptuous" being, which can mean a sensually aroused being. For example, Schreber wrote "As soon as I am alone with God... I must continually or at least at certain times, strive to give divine rays the impression of a woman in the height of sexual delight."34 This view of woman, which is a major theme of the Memoirs, has nothing to do with pregnancy and cannot be reduced to "woman as womb" without serious distor tion. But Wollust means more than sensuality; it can be used without reference to sex, as in Wollust des Lebens, "lust for life." Macalpine and Hunter note this35 and Wilden explores it. For Schreber, the divine rays would enjoy "voluptuous ness" because the state of Blessedness enjoyed by God and the dead souls was itself a kind of "voluptuousness." "Voluptuousness can be considered as part of everlasting Blessedness and is in a sense inherent in man and other living beings." Then Schreber reverts to Manicheism. Voluptuous enjoyment or Blessedness is granted to souls in perpetuity and as an end in itself, but to human beings and other living creatures solely as a means for the preserva tion of the species. Herein lie the moral limitations of voluptuousness for human beings.36 Then we have an attempt at "metacommunication," or at least an attempt to break through a dichotomy. For me, such moral limits to voluptuousness no longer exist, indeed in a certain sense the reverse applies ... I must point out that when I speak of my duty to cultivate voluptuous ness, / never mean any sexual desires toward other human beings . . . 37 Schreber seeks Blessedness and the overcoming of oppositions; in Wilden's words, "To be a woman means in fact nothing less than to be a human being"38 who lives "consonant with the Order of the World." The basic fear is that he will be turned into a woman within the exploitative structures of this world, turned over to others for sexual abuse. Wilden's reading of this vision is that it prefigures the radical Eros of Marcuse (and Norman O. Brown, perhaps), the force that culture has repressed and distorted. [Schreber's philosophy] describes a conflict between the way the world is and the way it ought to be ... . The world to come is a world of lust, not for objects, but for life; of voluptuousness not for the dreary mechanisms of genital sexuality, but for all the dimensions of being human. The condition of voluptuousness he seeks is neither male nor</page><page sequence="12">130 Journal of Religion and Health female, but rather a state of BLESSEDNESS, an Order of the World in which "all legitimate interests are in harmony." With that sentence Schreber deserves a place among the great mystics and the great Utopian socialist philosophers. His psychological idiosyncracies remain interesting, but . . . they are in essence irrelevant to the articulation of his philosophical discourse.39 Without wishing to undermine Wilden's eloquence, I would like to note that Schreber's "philosophical discourse" is irrevocably bound up with his personal history. Although the Memoirs contains many highly abstract accounts of the nature of God and the created universe, it is essentially an autobiography. He has to tell his own story in order to speak of the renewal of the Order of the World. Thus Schreber himself sees "personal idiosyncracies" and "philosophical discourse" as bound together. However, Wilden's point ought to be that these two aspects are present in Schreber just as they are in Freud and in any other thinkers. This is the truth behind the notion of personal myth, at least as I understand it. Nevertheless, Wilden's claim dramatically valorizes Schreber's Memoirs, undermining the force of categories such as "health and pathology." It is interesting that Schreber spoke his vision of Blessedness from an asylum, but it is not necessarily religiously relevant. More relevant is the systematic misreading of Schreber's ultimate goal, which says a good deal about the meanings of "woman" for Western culture and the immersion of psychology in these meanings. The next step will be to ask if a similar misreading may have occurred in the interpreta tion of Schreber's religious notions. Preoccupied with reading "father" for God, have the interpreters missed something crucial in the theology of the Memoirs? Schreber's God and the Order of the World By now, it should be apparent that there is no one correct or comprehensive interpretation of the material in the Memoirs. Each of the interpreters I have discussed drew on certain themes from Schreber's work; there are many ideas in the Memoirs that remain uninterpreted. Therefore,the goal of this section will not be to provide the definitive account of Schreber as religious person, but to take a close and serious look at two central religious ideas in the Memoirs: God and the Order of the World. The important fact to notice is that these are two separate concepts, both necessary to Schreber's system. Freud saw "God" as the remembered fantasy father of childhood, but said nothing about the second theme. Psychoanalysts looking at religion have looked for anthropomorphic deities or symbolic parents (totem animals) but far less at the impersonal, or seemingly impersonal concep tions. But for Schreber it is the Order of the World that takes precedence over God Himself. For the sake of acting in consonance with the Order of the World, Schreber will forgive God for His obtuseness and His torments. The Order of the World reveals its very grandeur and magnificence by denying even God Himself in so irregular a case as mine the means of achieving a purpose contrary to the Order of the World. All attempts at committing soul murder, at unmanning me for</page><page sequence="13">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 131 purposes contrary to the Order of the World . . . have failed. From this apparently so unequal battle between one weak human being and God Himself, I emerge . . . victo rious, because the Order of the World is on my side.40 In a footnote to this passage, Schreber defines "the Order of the World" not as an impersonal entity "higher than God," but as "the lawful relation which, resting on God's nature and attributes, exists between God and the creation called to life by Him." In other words, this relationship binds God Himself to act on behalf of the created order or to suffer the consequences of arbitrariness and discord. We today might refer to this as an "ecological" theology, in sharp contrast to the traditional stress on God's transcendence and dominance over the world. Schreber can and does appeal to this relationship, this Order against God the persecutor and master of corpses. God Himself, Schreber learned, is not omniscient or omnipotent; His igno rance of human organisms has already been mentioned. But more significantly, God is vulnerable to the force of human beings and to moral temptation. The rays (nerve-substance) of God became irresistibly attracted to Schreber himself, thus causing a "rent" in the sublime and miraculous Order of the World. Who was responsible for this? In my case, moral obliquity lay in God placing Himself outside the Order of the World by which He Himself must be guided; although not exactly forced, He was nevertheless induced to do this by a temptation very difficult for souls to resist.41 Is this charge completely reduceable to "mutinous insubordination" as Freud thought? Schreber is not raging against the ultimate moral order; he is accusing God of acting arbitrarily, of breaking his trust with lesser beings. God-as authority reveals Himself in the abuse of power, as morally culpable and then as stupidly punitive. One might say that God, not Schreber, acts on the basis of mutinous insubordination?insubordination against an Order of which He is part. At this level, the relation between God and Schreber is one of mutual recrimination. However majectic God may be, He is simultaneously a petty tyrant. On the one occasion when God spoke directly to Schreber, His voice was mighty and terrifying. "Also, what was spoken did not sound friendly by any means: everything seemed calculated to instill fright and terror into me, and the word 'wretch' was frequently heard."42 Schreber interprets "wretch" not as an ordinary insult, but as an expression meaning "a human being destined to be destroyed by God and to feel God's power and wrath." But God does not destroy Schreber and triumph, for God is composed of nerves, which seek voluptuousness. Through the "cultivation of voluptuous ness" Schreber hoped to restore those nerves of God that became attracted to his body, to their lost state of Blessedness ("soul-voluptuousness"). God Himself will exist once again in harmony with his creation. The purpose of the World Order will be realized: "For God eternal joy at His creation, for human beings the joy of life during their earthly existence, and after death the greatest happiness, the state of Blessedness."48 This eschatological, erotic vision uses strange and idiosyncratic language. But the message may be less strange to us: a God deeply</page><page sequence="14">132 Journal of Religion and Health implicated in oppression and exploitation, is doomed. Such a God is culpable, for in siding with power and dominion, He has lost all claim on our loyalties. Yet instead of angry protest against the God-of-authority, Schreber insists that God cannot betray His own creation, for "the Order of the World carries its own remedies for healing the wounds inflicted upon it." We may say that Schreber learned about both God and the abuse of authority from his father. But the God Schreber discovered in his childhood, mediated by Dr. Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber, was the God of Western Christian culture, of the Protestant era and of patriarchy. For Schreber's culture, this God was the good father. Theologian Albrecht Ritschl summed up the official, public view: The real analogy for the Kingdom of God should be sought, not in the national state, but in the family ... the forgiveness of sins by God as Father finds no real standard of comparison in the right of pardon which belongs to the head of the state.44 But what of sins committed by the Father against His children? Can these be forgiven, or even mentioned? The head of state is?theoretically?subject to law (Schreber was a judge), but to what law must the Father be answerable? This, we believe, is the religious problem that faced Schreber's culture and, in another form, may be facing us still. At what Wilden calls the "metacommunicative" level, Schreber is saying something about the moral/religious inadequacy of God-as-authority, of God in the image of the father. He is trying to speak of a transcendent Eros that includes all creation, but the God-language he knew was not fitted for this. The only language of "God" he knew was the language of paternal authority, just as the only language of "woman" he knew was of sensuality and exploitation. Few of Schreber's contemporaries were aware of the moral threat of such language, its religious and psychological consequences. Freud did not publish Totem and Taboo, with its myth of the primal patriarch and his murder, until 10 years after the appearance of the Memoirs. Unlike Schreber, another victim of German patriarchal culture recovered sufficiently to begin an enquiry into the origins of it: Max Weber on The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.^ Nietzsche, like Schreber, died mad. But Schreber's doctors were men of sense and reason. They understood "mental illness" and did not see why the worst phase of his illness was called by Schreber "my holy time." Personal myth I had hoped to conclude this inquiry into Schreber as religious person by pointing out the relevance of the Memoirs as a "limiting case" of private religion. It appeared to me that taking an idiosyncratic extreme might be a way to ask, "How much plurality and individualism can we stand in our myths?" Recent interest in personal narrative as a vehicle for theology made this question sound proper. As a book reviewer faced with one more religionist's autobiography put it, God's story having become very nearly unintelligible, the attempts of such as Keen, Rubenstein, Dunne, Novak and Cox to supplement (or supplant) traditional theologizing with stories of themselves have so far proven salutary.46</page><page sequence="15">Religion and Madness: Schreber's Memoirs as Personal Myth 133 Schreber tells both his own story and God's, but in such a way that few will be able to recognize themselves in this tale. Or so I thought. But this "idiosyncratic" extreme turned out to be only a beginning. From this point, it would have been possible to raise the same kind of question Ricoeur did: Now that we know something about the "caricature" of religion, have we really learned anything about religion itself? The answer still could have been "yes," but it would have missed the point. Schreber's theology is not a "caricature"; it is a radical attempt at a new religious insight. Blessedness comes not through authority, but in erotic, ecological harmony. To read Schreber this way is to put him in a historical context, an older contemporary of Freud, Weber, Jung, and others who saw the limits of their Protestant culture's vision. Jung's own attempt to recover "the Feminine" seems?in contrast to Schreber's?hopelessly romantic, disembodied, and timid. It was Jung who asked himself the question, since the Christian myth is no longer livable, "But then, what is your myth?the myth in which you do live?"47 The notion of "personal myth" starts here, with the recognition that a culturally shared universe of meaning no longer works, and that the search for myth must be carried out by each individual. James Hillman has seen an implication of this that Jung himself fought against: from now on, we have a plurality of myths.48 Thus the problem of "personal myth" is its isolation from community and culture. This is an isolation built into Jung's psychology and presupposed by those who tell their own stories instead of God's. It is an isolation experienced in its intensest form by Schreber, convinced as he was that never in the history of the world had one person been the locus of so much divine activity. But then the roots of this loss of shared meanings lie in the religious situation of our era, not solely in Schreber's personal eccentricities. Obviously there is a difference between Jung dictating his autobiography (however weird its contents) to a faithful disciple, and Schreber writing from an asylum. But this difference may be a measure of what the world at large learned in the 60 years or so between the publication of the two documents. Moreover, one might also see Jung, for all his resentment of Protestantism, as considerably more "safe" theologically than Schreber. One final comparison is in order. Other autobiographies of mental patients have been published, many of which can also be described as "personal myths." I am thinking particularly of the writings of Anton Boisen, a schizophrenic minister who suggested that his own "exploration of the inner world" retraced a journey taken by George Fox and other religious figures of the past. Why not then begin with Boisen, who went on to become the first mental hospital chaplain and one of the founders of the pastoral counseling movement? Surely Boisen would be a more promising example of the mad person as religious thinker, since his influence was so much greater in theology than Schreber's. However, the title of Boisen's autobiography is Out of the Depths, and although he never in actuality completely "recovered," he orders his "personal myth" as a journey into a "little-known country" from which he managed to return.49 Another example of the same metaphor is the autobiography of R. D. Laing's patient, Mary Barnes: Two Accounts of a Journey through Madness.50 In other</page><page sequence="16">134 Journal of Religion and Health words, these are the accounts of those who went "through" terrifying and meaningfiil experience and recovered sufficiently to write about "what it was like." The vast majority of mental patients' autobiographies take that form, for obvious reasons. The "I made it" theme is rarely smug, and I have never read one of these documents that does not show a tremendous amount of compassion for those who lost their way in the little-known country. Whether in fact the authors were "sane" or "cured" when they wrote, the point of view is retrospec tive: "I was there, now I'm here." Schreber's Memoirs does not have this plot. He is not going "through" mad ness, he is in it. He is never going to relinquish his religion or his transforma tion into a woman, as Boisen relinquished many of his "bizarre" ideas and returned to liberal Protestant theology. It is with Schreber, then, that we can begin to think about a "dialogue" with madness rather than a new interpreta tion of it. But this may be the wrong route to take: both Schreber and Boisen were thoroughly atypical schizophrenics, and to romanticize their "outsider" status may not be helpful to us or to their contemporary fellow-patients. Schre ber's religious vision claims our interest not because he was an "outsider" but because he was inside the religious dilemma of his era and attempting to transcend it. That he did so from an asylum may be, as Wilden says, irrelevant. Schreber himself hoped that "my 'Memoirs'?the present work will one day become an important source of information about the structure of an entirely new religious system."51 His work has already served as a source for psychiatric system-building. Perhaps we are now ready to listen to its author's original intention more closely, as we today have experienced the collapse of the old religious structure. References 1. Schreber, D.
