<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARK: THE FORMATION, CHARACTERISTICS, AND USES OF BARK AROUND THE WORLD. By Ghillean Tolmie Prance and Anne E. Prance; photo- graphs by Kjell B. Sandved. Published in association with The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, by Timber Press, Portland(Oregon). $49.95.174 p.; ill.; index of scientific names and general index. ISBN: 0-88192-262-5. 1993. This book could be titled "Everything You Wanted to Know about Bark but Were Afraid to Ask." The text and stunning photographs are an aesthetically pleasing and botanically correct compilation of facts and images of bark. This topic has historically been overlooked in most botany and forestry textbooks, which is puzzling, given the obvious importance of bark in tree structure and function, and for hu- man uses. The book relies heavily on photographs taken by a renowned nature photographer. Each chapter has only 1 to 2 pages of text sandwiched among 5 to 8 pages of gorgeously textured color photo- graphs. The topics covered include some botanical aspects of bark; latexes, tannins and resins in bark; uses of bark (e.g., medicines, hallucinogens, poi- sons, flavors, canoes, cork, cloth, and fuel); and bark as habitat (e.g., camouflage, flora and fauna). An index of scientific names is given. No glossary is presented, but technical terms are clearly de- fined in the text. The emphasis of the book is definitely on the multiple ethnobotanical uses of bark by a variety of cultures, from Amazonian Indian use of bark for hallucinogenic drugs to the harvest of oak bark for wine corks. The authors present a wealth of well-documented examples of bark use that would be extremely helpful for presentations in courses on ethnobotany or general botany. The writing style is aimed at the well-read lay- person rather than the botanist. Many personal examples of the authors are given, and the reading flows easily. Although some technical terms are used (e.g., chlorenchyma, monoterpenes), the text can be easily understood by undergraduates. Only a few chapters had references to scientific papers at the end. Certain anthropomorphic phrases may stick in the craw of the academic audience: for example, "[photosynthetic bark] is one of the inge- nious ways by which plants grow in the hostile, dry environment of semideserts" (p. 39). As a bota-</page><page sequence="2">DECEMBER 1994 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 529 nist, I also wished that the identity of the plant family of each example had been presented. In summary, this is a good (though moderately pricey) book to have on one's shelf (or coffee table) to learn about an interesting and important facet of plant biology. The book provides a trove of in- formation for developing a robust lecture or two on the subject of bark. The images renew a sense of wonder at the beauty and complexity of trees. NALINI M.
