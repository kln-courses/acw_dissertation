<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beastly Love: Gottfried Benn/Else Lasker-Schüler DOROTHEE OSTMEIER University of Washington The 25 June 1913 issue of the expressionist journal Die Aktion presents Else Lasker-Schüler's essayistic prose poem «Doktor Benn» in a column preceded by her drawing of the poet-physician. Opposite Lasker-Schüler's text, the parallel column presents Gottfried Benn's poem «Drohungen.» In the fol lowing pages of the journal the remainder of Benn's poetic cycle Alaska ap pears.1 Lasker-Schüler describes her attraction to Benn with a wide range of metaphors: «Wenn ich mich vertanzt habe, weiß nicht, wo ich hin soll, dann wollte ich, ich wäre ein grauer Samtmaulwurf und würfe seine Achselhöhle auf und vergrübe mich in ihr. Eine Mücke bin ich und spiele immerzu vor sei nem Gesicht. Aber eine Biene möchte ich sein, dann schwirrte ich um seinen Nabel» (3.1:277). Benn counters such desires for physical and emotional at tachment with his poem «Drohungen,» which warns the beloved of the risks of sexual encounter: «Aber wisse: / Ich lebe Tiertage» (G 49). In the context of Die Aktion the conjunction «aber» functions as a marker of response to Lasker-Schüler's prose text. It establishes a dialogue with the beloved and with her imagery. With these references to their biographical encounter Lasker-Schüler and Benn ground their poetry in the experience of their intimate relationship and oppose any perception of the poems as mere aestheticism.2 Their dialogue turns into a public and poetic discourse on love, sexuality and gender. We do not know the details of their actual romance, but the corresponding fiction alizations of their passion demonstrate how each grappled with the interper sonal attractions, aggressions and frustrations of their relationship. As reflec tions on the personal encounter the poetry offers insights into two distinct perceptions of sexual partnership.3 The following analysis will examine the poets' debate about sexuality and explore the psychological and philosophi cal implications of the images they exchanged. The poems of Benn's Alaska and Söhne cycles and Lasker-Schüler's Gottfried Benn cycle describe poetic processes which lead in Benn's case from the jarring estrangement of the part ners to the euphoric unity of their association and in Lasker-Schüler's case from bold attempts at assimilation to despairing alienation. This reversal centers around the possibility of a poetically constructed «we» as a unity</page><page sequence="2">44 Dorothee Ostmeier based on the deconstruction of individual identities, of «I» and «you.» At stake is the relationship between the expressive functions of poetic imagery and the authors' perception of its limits: Lasker-Schiiler refers to the prelin guistic experience of the encounter while Benn retreats into poetic euphoria at the end of his cycle. Before analyzing individual poems I will outline the larger contexts of the debate between the two poets as these are suggested by the dedications of their cycles and by corresponding prose texts. The juxtaposed publication of Lasker-Schüler's and Benn's texts in Die Aktion provides the first explicit public evidence of a love relationship of the poets which apparently ended a few months later. In a public letter to Franz Marc published in the the 1 November 1913 issue of Die Aktion, Lasker Schiiler - in the guise of Prince Jussuf of Thebes - describes her pain about the end of her love relationship with Benn. She distinguishes between Benn as the poetic figure «Giselheer» and the prosaic figure «Doktor Benn»: Seit ich Giselheer verlor, kann ich nicht mehr weinen und nicht mehr lachen. Er hat ein Loch in mein Herz gebohrt. [...] Ich schrieb ihm: «Gisel, König, ich weiß nicht, ob ich schlafe oder wache» [...] So ein Barbar! [...] Den Doktor Benn rief ich, der meinte, das Loch im meinem Herzen könnte man mit einem einzigen Faden zunähen. Ich vertraute ihm die Geschichte meiner Liebe an, zeigte ihm Giselheers Briefe und sagte ihm alles. Ich habe Vertrauen zum Doktor Benn; was er sagt, ist gesagt. Er behauptet, ich habe meine Welt in G. hineingelegt, denn der habe keine Ahnung von mir. Wenn ich daran denke, wie er einen Strich zog unter meinem Mantel wie unter die Lackschuhe einer Puppe [...] Ich habe dem Doktor Benn ehrenwörtlich versprochen, nicht mehr an den armen König zu denken, der noch nicht einmal ein Herz besitzt zum Verschwenden.» (3.1:312-13) Lasker-Schiiler writes to «Giselheer,» but she speaks to «Doktor Benn» and thus she distinguishes between fictions of writing and of speaking. In her ren dering of the conversation, the figure «Doktor Benn» identifies the speaker's relationship with Giselheer as a projection without references to any external reality. «Doktor Benn» implicitly concedes his familiarity with Giselheer but rejects responsibility for her wound when he tells her, «der [Giselheer] habe keine Ahnung von mir [Lasker-Schüler].» He sharply distinguishes between Doktor Benn and Giselheer, the two figures which merge in Prince Jussuf's perspective. The reference of the personal pronoun «er» remains undefined in the sentence «Wenn ich daran denke, wie er einen Strich zog.» Despite her persona Jussuf's promise to Doktor Benn to think no longer about Giselheer, Lasker-Schiiler continued writing poetry about her relation</page><page sequence="3">Beastly Love 45 ship with Benn and included a cycle of poems bearing the poet-physician's name in Die gesammelten Gedichte published in 1917 (cf. 1.2:193-94). The three-line poem that serves as the motto of this cycle and appears under its name clearly links Gottfried Benn with Giselheer: «Der hehre König Gisel heer / Stieß mit seinem Lanzenspeer / Mitten in mein Herz» (1.1:200). Las ker-Schüler plays with the mythological connotations of the name Giselheer: on one hand she militarizes the name Giselher by adding an additional «e» to the syllable «her,» but on the other she stresses his erotic potency by invoking the image of the God Amor.4 The fascination with the bond between violence and eroticism underlies the poems of the Gottfried Benn cycle of 1917. Ironi cally and playfully the first two lines rhyme the adjective «hehr» with the nouns «Heer» and «Speer,» associating the sublime with the cruel. The poem promotes Benn as the exotic personification of paradoxes. The cycle's title and its motto are in apposition, signaling the painful tensions between literal and fictional reality, between authentic, poetic and mythological figurations of Benn. The «Giselheer» figure evokes Lasker-Schüler's personal pain and vulnerability in the context of the relationship, but his association with Amor recalls also his poetic and erotic attractiveness. Some poems of the cycle were composed at different moments of the per sonal affair between 1912 and 1913. But Lasker-Schiiler also included poems dating from 1904-05 and 1910—11, before the start of the relationship, and from 1914 and 1917, after its end.5 Viewed as a whole, the cycle reflects and actualizes the complexity of issues involved without restricting their relev ance to the time of their composition or first publication. By collecting and publishing these texts in 1917, Lasker-Schiiler seems to take a retrospective glance at these issues. A few months after the first publication of Alaska Benn republished six of the poems in the cycle Söhne in October 1913. This cycle of ten formally numbered poems is part of a volume also named Söhne which contains eight additional poems composed between 1912 and 1913.6 The dedication of the volume quotes from Lasker-Schüler's epistolary series Briefe nach Norwe gen: «Ich grüße Else Lasker-Schüler: ziellose Hand aus Spiel und Blut» (3.1:233, cf. 3.2:223 and 273)7 Thus the cycle not only functions as a docu ment of the sons' «expressionistischen Aufstand gegen die Welt der Väter»8 but also as a further reflection on the relationship to Lasker-Schüler. In her letter Lasker-Schüler contrasts her poetic self-characterization with a portrayal of Karl Kraus in a painting which the editors of the Kritische Aus gabe attribute to Oskar Kokoschka (3.2:223). In Lasker-Schüler's meditation about this painting the hand functions as synecdoche for two different life styles. She describes Karl Kraus' hand as «eine sichere Ministerhand, eine</page><page sequence="4">46 Dorotbee Ostmeier gütige Diplomatenhand, eine züngelnde Hand, sie kann eine Stadt anstek ken» (3.1:233), and a few sentences later she links the hand with the directed paths of his life: «Des Minsters Hand, eine ernste, mongolische Dolde, eine Hand, jeder seiner Pfade endet» (3.1:233). Consistent with her fictionaliza tions of Karl Kraus as «Papst» (3.1:143—44) and «Dalai Lama» (3.1:233), his hand is self-controlled and has the potential to exercise great influence. Thus she asks, «Was er wohl von meiner ziellosen Hand aus Spiel and Blut denkt?» (3.1:233). She knows that her life is full of risks; it does not follow one goal and allows chance to participate. In the beginning of the paragraph she asks, soll ich wachen oder schlafen. Lohnt es sich zu leben oder zu versäumen. Alles sollte sich lohnen, auch das Nichtvorhandene. Ich weiß, irgendwo sehnt sich ein Hadrian oder ein Pharao nach mir. Ist das nun wahr oder ist das nicht wahr? Aber ich finde so ein Gedanke lohnt sich. Allerdings, der Bürger verliert nie etwas, mich kostet vielleicht so einen Gedanken zu haben das Leben. (3.1:232) There are no stable criteria to distinguish between truth and fiction. At stake is the decision to accept fictions - «das Nichtvorhandene» and «nicht Wahre» - as reality and to risk the security of a bourgeois lifestyle. By quoting Lasker-Schüler's question as a factual characterization in the dedication of his «Söhne» volume, Gottfried Benn answers the question orig inally addressed to Karl Kraus and affirms Lasker-Schüler's poetic self-port rayal, honoring her as an exotic poetic figure.9 This perspective towards her is still evident forty years later. Benn concedes in a letter to his friend Fried rich Wilhelm Oelze on 16 February 1952 that Else Lasker-Schüler «war ja mal meine Freundin, 1912, - ach wie Sie mich verachten wegen aller meiner Affären!»10 In a publ ic talk at the British Centre in Berlin a week later Benn refers to the Berlin expressionist journals as a backdrop of the relationship: «Es war 1912, als ich sie kennenlernte. Es waren die Jahre des «Sturms» und der «Aktion,» deren Erscheinen wir jeden Monat oder jede Woche mit Unge duld erwarteten» (E 541). He remembers his former lover as a manifestation of attractive eccentricity: Sie war klein, damals knabenhaft schlank, hatte pechschwarze Haare, kurzgeschnitten, was zu der Zeit noch selten war, große rabenschwarze bewegliche Augen [...] Sie aß nie regelmäßig, sie aß sehr wenig, oft lebte sie wochenlang von Nüssen und Obst. Sie schlief oft auf Bänken, und sie war immer arm in allen Lebenslagen und zu allen Zeiten. Das war der Prinz von Theben, Jussuf, Tino von Bagdad, der schwarze Schwan. Und dies war die größte Lyrikerin, die Deutschland je hatte. (E 541-42)</page><page sequence="5">Beastly Love 47 Benn identifies Lasker-Schüler with the personae of her prose texts and refers to her self-portrayals in the public letters. She had regularly signed them with one of these poetic names, blurring the boundaries between poetic fiction and biography.11 With descriptions of her as «unerklärlich,» «unmöglich,» «auf fallend,» «geheimnisvoll» he continues to idealize her, fascinated by her extraordinary ability to diverge from conventional life styles, but he fails to thematize her suffering under fascism.12 Quoting her poem «Höre» from the Gottfried Benn cycle, Benn responds to the last lines of the poetic question - «Fühlst du mein Lebtum / Uberall / Wie ferner Saum?» (1.1:173) - person ally: «Dieses Lebtum als fernen Saum hab ich immer gefühlt, alle Jahre, bei aller Verschiedenheit der Lebenswege und Lebensirrungen» (E 543). He in terprets «Lebtum» as an ahistorical entity which outlasts the critical dif ferences of the poets' actual biographies. In fact, by not specifying these dif ferences he avoids speaking straightforwardly about his sympathy for and support of the National Socialist movement in 1933 and the first half of 193413 at the very time that Else Lasker-Schüler was apparently roughed up or even beaten in Berlin and decided to leave Germany.14 He praises the radi cal unity of Lasker-Schüler's personality, her «Lebtum»: «Immer unbeirrbar sie selbst, fanatisch sich selbst verschworen, feindlich allem Satten, Sicheren, Netten [...] sie nahm sich die großartige und rücksichtslose Freiheit, über sich allein zu verfügen, ohne die es ja Kunst nicht gibt» (E 542). She represents for him the absolutely integrated lifestyle of an artist which he - according to the second part of his autobiographical essay Doppelleben (1950) - had given up by splitting his bourgeois life as a physician from his life as an artist. He ad mits, «wir denken etwas anderes als wir sind» (P 448), and presents Lasker Schüler as a counterexample two years later: she resisted such schizophrenic splits and presented publically the artistic lifestyle which he had excluded from his bourgeois life. Benn's poem «Mann» appeared in the 26 June 1912 issue of Die Aktion (cf. G 514), a year before the publication of Alaska. It introduces the complex issues raised by sexual encounters in general, which the Alaska cycle later ela borates and modifies. Structured as a Rollengedicht in which two lovers en gage in a conversation about their «love,» it presents «Mann» and «Frau» as independent speakers. Whereas the stage directions restrict the male speaker to his linguistic presence, they call for physical transformations of the «Frau.» She expands her speech by dancing and disrobing: «Kleid fort von meinen Hüften» (G 31). In the end she sinks into the sand, inviting her lover to join her. The man addresses his beloved as attractive and offensive at the same time. Rejecting her animalistic features, he describes her as «Halbdurchflossenes, /</page><page sequence="6">48 Dorothee Ostmeier Vom Tier getränkt, und wie im Fell der Tiere» (G 31). He cannot identify her eroticised body with the «you» of his address and postulates a split between the physical and nonphysical identity of the partner. He observes: «Ja, du warst es gar nicht, / An dessen Fleisch ich faßte. Es ist anders» (G 31). And later he asks, «Was soll behaarte Brust, behaarte Schenkel / Auf Haut voll Schweiss und Talg, blutflüssigem Schoß?» (G 32). Highlighted by the image of the menstruating uterus, her carnal presence contradicts the attraction which he expresses through his metaphoric apostrophe of her as «Flieder» and «stiller Garten» (G 32).15 He calls these metaphors the language of his dreams - «so sang mein Traum» (G 32) - and identifies her eroticised body as «Spiel der Träume» (G 31). But this metaphoric perception is separated from literal realities. The lover rejects the beloved harshly when she ignores his frustrations. Her dance celebrates her gradual integration into nature: her body merges with flowers, ocean and clouds and her euphoria leads to the transgression of genuine borders: ... Die Beete bluten wie aus breiten Wunden Ihr Scharlach um mein Knie. Es röchelt Vom Meer um meine Hüften. In die Wolken Stäubt mein Gelock - (G 32) The anthropomorphic description of flower beds and ocean and the trans figuration of the hair fuse her body with its surroundings. This integration climaxes in a poetic, i.e., synesthetic, unification with the sun: - In langen Lauten singt das Licht An mir entlang. O Sonne, Du Rosenmutter - komm, du, wir wollen nieder Auf diesen warm vom Meer besamten Strand (sinkt hin). (G 32) Her sexually aroused body gains a universal harmony with nature. Whereas she ties her literal seduction to its metaphoric description, her lover separates the literal and metaphoric perception of sexuality. With a shrewd parallelism the last stanza lists several questions calling the partner's body a piece of meat: Was liegst du nun im Sand, du weisses Fleisch, Was rinnst du nicht und sickerst in das Meer? Was kommen keine Vögel über dich Wie über anderes Fleisch? (G 32) In the very last lines the «I» abstracts further from all traces of individuality and animalistic vitality and reduces the partner to a barren landscape. The conventional metaphors for the erotic body, lilac and garden, are de-aesthe ticized and mortified:</page><page sequence="7">Beastly Love 49 Heimkehr! Nun grüss ich euch, zerfressene Steine, Und dich, mein Blut, von Leichen aller Meere beworfen, du zerklüftet Gelände ohne Frucht, das taumelnd Am Rand der Erde steht. (G 32) As inanimate territory the «you» turns into an absolute metaphor which can not be paraphrased or translated into realistic imagery.16 Depersonalized, freed from conventional semantic references, the «you» is exposed as shock ingly barren in its essence. The man confines her imagery when he reduces the «Meer» to «Leichen aller Meere,» «Beete» to «Gelände ohne Frucht,» and «stäuben» to «taumelnd stehen.» He also identifies the woman with natural images by turning her into a rugged landscape and identifying her with bar renness. The woman inscribes herself into his dream of a prolific garden and summer scene. Thus the woman's self-perception differs radically from the man's perception of her. Depicting the beloved as a coast with cliffs separated from the sea, he presents her as threshold and abyss. Projecting his own fatal ism onto her - he speaks about his «verstossenes Blut» (G 32) - he petrifies her exhilarating trance. She views the ocean as the life-enabling fertilizer of the sand («besamten Strand») into which she sinks, he calls the ocean «Leiche.» One might view this feminization of a landscape as a poetic rene wal of the tradition of Landschaftslegenden, the most familiar example of which is the German Lorelei legend. In the beginning of the poem a stone functions as simile for the closeness of «Du» and «ich:» «Nun aber ist dies alles festgefügt, / Geschlossen wie ein Stein und unentrinnbar: Du und ich» (G 31). In the end the partners are separated: the «Steine zerfressen», the «Ge lände zerklüftet.» Emile Benveniste has described personal pronouns as «empty» signs that are nonreferential with respect to «reality.» These signs always become «full» as soon as a speaker introduces them into an instance of discourse.17 «Mann» demonstrates how individual discourses design the partner. The perceptions of «I» and «you» change according to the different agendas of their users: the woman inscribes herself into the dream of the man, while he separates this dream from the reality of the sexual encounter. Portraying the woman as rugged landscape, he designs the perfect desolate «home» for himself as the male beast, welcoming it with the exclamation «Heimkehr!»18 This imagery might have been inspired by Benn's familiarity with the coast around Rügen. In Lehensweg eines Intellekte allsten he describes this area of his childhood as «unendlich geliebtes Land» (P 310). The connotations of the imaginary landscape are quite ambiguous however: as female it is attractive, but as marked by an abyss, by death and infertility, it is terrifying.19 The title</page><page sequence="8">50 Dorothee Ostmeier Alaska for the poems published in February and June 1913 and especially the poems' elaboration of the motifs «Schluchten» (G 51), «Abgrund»(G 44,50), «Bucht» (G 47) refer to some elements of this landscape. Alaska may cer tainly be associated with «Rand der Erde,» the description of the feminized landscape in «Mann.» As an exotic and primitive site of vitality it promises to become a new home for the male beast. The first lines of the initial poem ridicule Europe as nasty physical waste produced by ill-bred confirmands. This critique moves the «I» to distance himself from his cultural heritage:20 Europa, dieser Nasenpopel Aus einer Konfirmandennase, Wir wollen nach Alaska gehn. Der Mensch: der Urwaldmensch: Der alles aus seinem Bauch gebiert, Der Robben frisst, der Bären totschlägt, Der den Weibern manchmal was reinstösst: Der Mann. (G 42) The excursion to Alaska offers the possibility to explore man's animalistic in stincts and to free them from cultural constraints. While the Judeo-Christian tradition devastates Europe, the wanderers - driven by physical and sexual appetites - retreat to an earlier time and culture, committed to reviving their primitive heritage. The twelve poems of this cycle are loosely connected by this voyage and offer a broad panorama of male concepts of sexuality. In «Drohungen,» the eighth poem of the cycle, the male lover scrutinizes his self-portrayal as «Meermensch» and «Urwaldmensch» in the cycle's opening poem. Being engaged in brutish love, «Tierliebe,» he identifies him self as «Affen-Adam.» The poem is not only called «Drohungen,» it also starts with a warning about the connotations of its imagery: «Aber wisse: / Ich lebe Tiertage» (G 49). Love has lost its sublime connotations. Although the «I» invites the beloved for the night in the beginning, he ultimately warns her against accepting the invitation: «Sieh: Abgrund über tausend Sternen naht / Sieh: Schlund, in den du es ergiessen sollst. / Sieh: Ich. -» (G 50). The insistent anaphora «Sieh» stresses the risk of the contact: the results of the nocturnal encounter cannot be predicted. This image of the rugged landscape is analogous to the closing imagery for the woman in «Mann.» There her fea tures pose a threat to the man; here it is the man who poses the threat and warns her of an «abyss.» Poem IX is more specific: «Ich bringe Pest. Ich bin Gestank. / Vom Rand der Erde komm ich her» (G 51). Quoting from the last line of «Mann,» the poem's speaker here associates the edge of the earth with intercourse as a sickening experience. The man is infected by whores: «Das</page><page sequence="9">Beastly Love 51 bißchen Seuche / Aus Hurenschleim in mein Blut gesickert?» (G 51). The word «Hure» does not suggest a social issue here; all sexual relationships are characterized as prostitution. He also insults his mother and father as «ausge borene Schluchten» (G 51), and includes their marital sexuality in this in fectious cycle. As a sexual being he portrays himself in «Drohungen» with prehuman features - «meine Vorderflossen sind schon lang und haarig» (G 49) - and beastly sexual practices: «In der ersten Nacht ist alles ent schieden. / Man faßt mit den Zähnen, wonach man sich sehnt. / Hyänen, Tiger, Geier sind meine Wappen. -» (G 49). His love withdraws from any civ ilized interaction and his bestiality frees the term «love» from all idealistic connotations, from conventional, emotional, and ethical constraints. Love is depersonalized and implies no personal commitments. As spontaneous sex uality it serves solely the fulfillment of animalistic desires: «Es ist so schön an deinem Blut. -» (G 49). Sexual pleasure rejects the emotional bond with the beloved: «Du, daß wir nicht an einem Ufer landen! / Du machst mir Liebe: blutigelhaft: / Ich will von dir. -» (G 49). Obsessed with the love encounter but at the same time desiring to escape from it, he experiences a schizoid split. He refutes any association of the lovers as a unity of the «wir» and insists on separation. The lover knows that the beloved keeps ties to her humanness. On the one hand, he calls her «schweifende Hyäne»( G 49) and views her as a partner for his «Affen-Adam» (G 49). On the other, he associates her with major Biblical figures and their «happy-end» love stories. He calls her «königlicher Becher,» referring perhaps to the uterine shape of the «Becher» but also to Lasker Schiiler's self-portrayal as Joseph.21 And he identifies her as «Ruth,» the Bib lical archetype of matrimonal faith, patience, and love.22 The partner's sexual attractiveness contradicts her human features and the cultural inscriptions of her body. With the introduction of male and female images for his partner, he abstracts from gender and focusses on sexuality in general. Thus the image of the beloved is semantically polyvalent, and it contradicts the clear-cut beastly features of the male partner. He goes so far as to describe his body in Darwi nian terms with the features of prt-homo sapiens men. This relationship to prehistorical and precultural roots is further explored and specified in the Alaska poems. After sharp polemics against Judeo-Chri stian culture, poem VI dreams about a regression into undifferentiated, an cient, and prehuman lifeforms: Oh, dass wir unsere Ur-ur-ahnen wären. Ein Klümpchen Schleim in einem warmen Moor. Leben und Tod, Befruchten und Gebären Glitte aus unseren stummen Säften vor. (G 47)</page><page sequence="10">52 Dorothee Ostmeier These lines link ethnological and biological ideas; in fact, the «I» traces his cultural origins not only in early stages of the evolution of human culture but also in biological roots.23 He either desires to trace plasmatic life forms in the present body or he wishes to undo the evolutionary process. Benn modifies Ernst Haeckel's biogenetic law - which views ontogeny as a short and quick repetition of phylogeny - by switching its progressive mode into a regressive mode. The last poem of the cycle fulfills the desire of the sixth poem, the subjunc tive mode now replaced by past and present indicative. The adventure fo cusses on the search for the unknown territory of the beloved, more specifi cally on the sexual encounter with her, and on the celebration of the unity of the «we.» It depicts the effort of the male speaker to overcome his conflicts with female sexuality. Whereas the eighth poem in the cycle - «Drohungen» - confronts sexuality as bestial threat, the last poem, «Uber Gräber,» over comes its anguish.24 Sexuality instigates bodily warming and liquefaction: «Wir aber wehn: ägäisch sind die Fluten» (G 54). The last lines image this physiological warmth as present Greek summer and ocean landscape. The ex cursion does not end in Alaska - clearly the travellers never reach Alaska - but in the seascapes of Greece. The snow and ice evoked by the title are never actualized, but are replaced by summer, rocks, tides, waves, and dances. The last stanza euphorically celebrates the creation of a «wir.» As sequel to the poem «Madonna» - and the man's declaration «Ich bin so hingesunken / An dich. Und bin so trunken / Von dir. Oh! Glück!» (G 53) - the «wir» in «Über Gräber» is clearly not the male «wir» of the opening poems: Wir aber wehn: ägäisch sind die Fluten. O was in Lauben unseres Fleischs geschah! Verwirrt im Haar, in Meer. Die Brüste bluten Vor Tanz, vor Sommer, Strand und Ithaka. (G 54) The alliteration of the first verse stresses the fluidity of the union between «I» and «you.» Bodies and landscape merge and contrast radically with the earlier images of stony and rocky landscapes in the poem «Mann.» There the union is described first as «festgefügt» and «unentrinnbar» before it breaks apart, here it turns into a vibrant and dynamic delirium. In the search for the Alas kan landscape of the «you,» the «I» loses sight of his destination, he loses control, subjecting himself to the experience of the «we.» The search takes the «I» by surprise; he is overwhelmed by the erotic and sexual adventure: «O was in den Lauben unseres Fleisches geschah!» The «I» no longer splits the present from the past, literal from metaphoric language, but mediates be tween them. The «Laube,» familar from 18th- and 19th-century literature,</page><page sequence="11">Beastly Love 53 here functions as a hiding place for lovers; the body itself takes over its func tions and turns into the locus amoenus. The «we» is created under the skin. Benn focuses on invisible physiological processes that unify the partners. By shifting into past tense, the speaker with his emphatic «O» implies more than he actually says. He refers to the unrepresentable creation of the «we» and of «our flesh.» Benn deviates here from conventional, medical, psychoanalytical and other descriptions of the pleasures of intercourse. Genitalia are secondary to the physiological processes, and intercourse is no longer tied to procreation. It creates the «we» by dissolving the differences between «I» and «you» and founding a new physiological unity. The seductive dance of the woman in the poem «Mann» turns now into a metaphor for the vital dynamics of bodily liquids: «die Brüste bluten / vor Tanz» (G 54). The water images of the Alaska cycle associate intercourse with moving water. Inner floods correspond to the external bleeding, and sexual arousal is associated with inner liquefactions and identified as arousal of an ancient life form which predates advanced sex ual reproduction. Thus sexuality reverses and transcends the evolutionary process while establishing a bond between the partners. The differentiated «I» and «you» are no longer present, but merge into the new poetic, abstract category «we.» The last poem contrasts this exhilarating sexual experience of the «we» with a physically violent sexuality. Here, conventional sexuality, portrayed in terms of baking and as beastly, leads to physical destruction: «Schließlich zer brach das Schwein ihm noch die Knochen» (G 54). This sadism is short-lived: «Das Fell wird ranzig und hat ausgepaart» (G 54). The last poem separates the literal and beastly reality of the sexual encounter from its poetic and meta phoric perception. In the context of matter-of-fact sexuality, one partner al ways subjugates the other; it is violent. The poetic «we,» in contrast, is freed from spatial, temporal and ethical conditions. The title «Über Gräber» recalls Christian motifs of transfigura tion and compares the «we» with the Christian afterlife of soul and spirit. Popular Protestant hymns - familiar to Benn through his religious upbring ing - honor the spiritual afterlife as rising from the «Todesnacht.»25 Here, however, it is not the individual soul that survives physical materiality; the poetically engendered «we» revives pre-individual physiological processes in the partners. In Christian theology nature has only a signifying function,26 while for Benn salvation is found in natural processes. Benn applies his knowledge of evolutionary theory to actualize this memory of common physiological roots. The search for an exotic Alaska leads to the confronta tion with the body's physiology and its association with prehistoric plasmatic</page><page sequence="12">54 Dorotbee Ostmeier processes. Sexuality surpasses individual and sexual differences, and the con cept of the «we» is abstracted from all ethical implications. As noted earlier the poem «Drohungen» was published side by side with Lasker-Schüler's prose text «Gottfried Benn» in the 25 June 1913 issue of Die Aktion. Since Alaska can be read as a pun on the name Lasker, the very title of the poetic cycle has autobiographical connotations. The search for the exotic country is related to Benn's attempt to come to terms with the attrac tions of his exotic beloved. Through the extensive poetic elaboration on the Alaska theme, Benn moves from rejecting a metaphoric perception of sex uality in «Mann» to accepting it in the last of the Alaska poems. But in this process he bypasses Alaska and arrives in «Ithaka.» He misses his original goal. «Ithaka» - the last word of the Alaska cycle - is also the title of a dramatic scene originally published in the March 1914 issue of Die weißen Blatter (cf. S 353). The young physician Rönne, modelled after Benn himself, sharply at tacks the scientific stance of a professor of pathology, his mathematical intel lectualism and positivism: «ich weiß! ich weiß! Feldherrntum des Intellekts! Jahrtausend aus Optik and Chemie! Ich weiß, ich weiß [...] Ich habe den gan zen Kosmos mit meinem Schädel zerkaut! Ich habe gedacht, bis mir der Speichel floß. Ich war logisch bis zum Koterbrechen» (S 24-25). Nauseated by his overindulgence in rational logic Rönne distances himself from science and argues: «Aber wegen meiner hätten wir Quallen bleiben sollen. Ich lege auf die ganze Entwicklungsgeschichte keinen Wert. Das Gehirn ist ein Irr weg» (S 25). Ironically, Rönne polemizes against evolutionary theory while his mindset is still controlled by the Darwinian logic of evolution versus re gression. Later he exchanges logical argument for association and evokes a poetic counterworld. He knows that he has to give up rational control in order to empower the associative process induced by an anonymous «es»: «Es assoziiert sich etwas in einem» (S 26). This initiation of free association inspires his heretofore silent fellow stu dent Kautski to engage in this alternative mode of speech. Kautski provides the key words for Rönne's later «Ithaka» fantasy.27 Whereas Kautski still refers to the evolutionary past - «Aber wir sind älter. Wir sind das Blut; aus den warmen Meeren, den Müttern, die das Leben gaben» (S 26) - Rönne ac tualizes an associative process which leads to a gradual transformation of the physical into an imaginary reality. He turns into a poet: ... Gehirne: kleine, runde, matt und weiß. Sonne, rosenschößig, und die Haine blau durchrauscht. Blühend und weich die Stirn. Entspannt an Strände. In Oleander</page><page sequence="13">Beastly Love 55 die Ufer hoch, in weiche Buchten süß vergangen... - ... Das Blut, als bräche es auf. Die Schläfen, als erhofften sie. Die Stirn, ein Rinnen wie von flüggen Wassern. O es rauscht wie eine Taube an mein Herz: lacht - lacht - Ithaka! - Ithaka!... - O, bleibe! Bleibe! Gib mich noch nicht zurück! (S 27-28) The first two lines contrast the narrowly confined human brain with a sunlit nature scene romanticized by synesthesia. The subsequent lines dissolve this contrast by fusing «Stirn» and «Strände» which results in the disintegration of physical confinements: «Die Stirn, ein Rinnen wie von flüggen Wassern.» This liquefaction corresponds to the spiritualization of the body: «... Die Schläfen, als erhofften sie» (S 27). The revision of the «Gehirn» from a con fined body part to an unbound source of inspiration is also marked by the use of the verb «rauschen» which describes the «Ithaka» imagination as a natural event: «O es rauscht wie eine Taube an mein Herz: lacht - / lacht - Ithaka! — Ithaka!... -» In fact, Rönne's last sentence calls this fantasy «Rausch,» an enchantment which is «stärker als der Tod» (S 28). Describing the poetic process he has just experienced, he abstracts it from all physical laws and declares it autonomous. Logical functions of the brain are replaced by creativity and imagination. The «Ithaka» fantasy allows Rönne to forget the laboratory and to immerse him self in poetic euphoria. This euphoria replaces the sexual partner in the «Ma donna» poem which starts with Rönne's line: «Gib mich noch nicht zurück» (G 53). In this case the actual euphoria originates in Rönne's poetic associ ation, whereas it is based on sexual ecstasy in the Alaska cycle published eight months earlier. The later short novels which also center on the Rönne figure, the so-called Rönne Novellen, tie poetic ecstasy to sexuality. They associate the two motifs separated in the earlier texts. In «Der Geburtstag,» for example, Rönne as a modern Pygmalion creates his sexual partner according to his own poetic fantasy, naming her «Edmee Denso» (P 44). In contrast, the phantasmic part ner in the Alaska poems has no name. The individual name Alaska or «Las ker» has only a mediating function. The poems do not focus on individual partners, but on the poetics of sexual arousal in general. The sexual partner is used as a vehicle for activating physiological processes and for reconnecting with ancient prehuman life forms. The poetically designed sexuality trans gresses individual borders, topographies, and gender differences and shifts the biographical connotations of «I» and «you» to the abstract poetic identity of a «we.» But this means that the «I» never reaches Alaska/Lasker and that</page><page sequence="14">56 Dorotbee Ostmeier he does not reconcile the literal and metaphoric reality of sex. As an actual individual Else Lasker remains isolated from her lover. Else Lasker-Schüler initially portrays Benn in her essayistic prose poem «Doktor Benn» as a down-to-earth representative of the medical profession who dispassionately examines the corpses at the morgue as part of the mech anical everyday routine of a physician: «Er steigt hinunter ins Gewölbe seines Krankenhauses und schneidet die Toten auf. Ein Nimmersatt, sich zu berei chern an Geheimnis. Er sagt: &lt;tot ist tot.&gt; Dennoch fromm im Nichtglauben liebt er die Häuser der Gebete» (3.1:277). The «Gewölbe seines Kranken hauses» - literally referring to the site at which he performed autopsies as an intern in the «pathologisch-anatomisches Institut des Krankenhauses Char lottenburg-Westend» (Hillebrand, «Biographie» G 594) - are however asso ciated with «Häuser der Gebete, träumende Altäre,» so that the macabre medical scene gains extraordinary devotional qualities. Benn's fascination with the enigma («Geheimnis») links his pragmatic and poetic reality, and the poems collected in Morgue that document this link are subsequently charac terized as «Grauenvolle Kunstwunder, Todesträumerei, die Kontur annahm» (3.1:277). Lasker-Schüler describes Benn as a mythological figure, as «Christ mit dem Götzenhaupt, mit der Habichtnase und dem Leopardenherzen. Sein Herz ist fellgefleckt.» In turning the physician into a poetic figure, she unveils the beastly features normally hidden by the conventions of civilization. She endows these features with religious connotations and adds landscape images to them when she calls him «lauter Fels, rauhe Ebene, auch Waldfrieden ... Oder Sie sind, Erde mit Wurzeln und Jagd und Höhenrauch und Löwenzahn und Brennesseln und Donner» (3.1:277). The paradoxical fusion of «Wald frieden» and «Donner,» of the serene and austere elements of a sublime ro mantic tableau,28 characterizes her further poetic portrayals of Benn. The cycle Gottfried Benn features the physician and poet as lover, his eyes as «Tigeraugen» (1.1:145) his face as «Dschungel» (1.1:145) and his body as «Steppe» (1.1:134). This exotic wildness is most attractive, but with his verse - called «Leopardenbiß, ein Wildtierspung» in the prose text - he can also threaten the beloved. In contrast to Lasker-Schüler's major prose texts Briefe nach Norwegen (1911-1912), Briefe und Bilder and its sequel Der Malik (1913-1917), all pub lished in major Berlin journals (cf.3.2:256—63), the poems do not explicitly evoke larger cultural - in this case fictional - contexts, such as her «Berlin» or «Theben.» Instead they eradicate them and focus solely on the relationship between the poetic «I» and «you.» Numerous questions indicate that the «I»</page><page sequence="15">Beastly Love 57 ■■ (Jhtt efom.

The «I» longs to resolve the paradox between intimacy with and dissociation from its partner. The split between «I» and «you» turns into a split between the «I» and its imaginary other. But as a projection of the «I» the «you» remains silent and does not gain an indi vidual voice. He does not respond. In what follows I will examine whether and how the female lover comes to terms with the paradox the male presents. Lasker-Schüler asserts a unity of the «we» only once, as an event of the past in «Das Lied des Spielprinzen»: Wie kann ich dich mehr noch lieben? Ich sehe den Heren und Blumen Bei der Liebe zu. Küssen sich zwei Sterne, Oder bilden Wolken ein Bild - Wir spielten es schon zarter. (1.1:152) These lines mark the difference between poetic imagery and biographical ex perience. The encounter of the «we» is the unrepresentable reference for all images which the poems evoke, but it is also the force which drives all images into existence. This is different in Benn's cycle, which has its climax in the poetic creation of the «wir.» Benn creates poetically what Lasker-Schüler longs for as a personal, pre- or postlinguistic experience. She contemplates a union that her language cannot grasp and that her relationship to Benn entails only erratically. Her poems are poetic efforts to overcome the separateness between the lovers. In the tradition of «Erlebnislyrik» some poems contrast the solitude of the «I» with its desires and dreams to reestablish the lost intimacy. Subjunctive phrases project the «I's» illusions; intentional phrases such as «Ich will» and «Ich möchte» poetically design an imagined new reality, and persuasive ad dresses to the partner crave his response.29 The poem «Giselheer dem Heiden» ends: «Alles ist tot / Nur du und ich nicht.»30 «I» and «you» are the only references, and through their relation ship the two figures protect each other against death. They preserve their in dividual identities although the «I» longs to overcome their separation. After the first eight two-line stanzas which lament her isolation she gives up the dreamlike projection of desires and challenges her partner's perception of her by declaring:</page><page sequence="17">Beastly Love 59 Ich will dich ganz zart mich lehren; Schon weißt du mich zu nennen. Sieh meine Farben, Schwarz und stern Und mag den kühlen Tag nicht, Der hat ein Glasauge. (1.1:149-50) She forbids any comparison of herself with nature, especially with the stars which can be assigned fixed astrological interpretations. By turning the noun of the simile «Meine Augen zeigen nicht den Weg / wie die Sterne» (lines 6-7) into the attributive adjective «Stern» (line 20) she rejects the simile's descrip tive function and instead fuses figurative and literal speech in order to call at tention to her own attractiveness. Her appeal should be read as a response to the lover's request in Benn's poem «Madonna,» published in both Alaska and Söhne: Gib mich noch nicht zurück. Ich bin so hingesunken An dich. Und bin so trunken Von dir. Oh! Glück! Die Welt ist tot. Der Himmel singt Hingestreckt an die Ströme der Sterne Hell und reif. Alles klingt In mein Herz. Tieferlöst und schöngeworden Singt das Raubpack meines Blutes Hallelujah. (G 53) The beloved is summoned as mediator between the lover and his aesthetic ex perience of the night. Sexual exhilaration offers him distance to the mundane world. Instead of turning his attention to the partner, he focusses on his own poetic tranquility, which leads to a transgression of the partnership. «Sing ing» unites the sky with the lover's heart, blood and poetry. Its religious con notations turn his «Tierliebe» into a secularized hymn devoted to the experi ence of sexual arousal. The «Madonna» seems to be out of the spotlight. In her response she redirects his attention towards herself as the repre sentation of the sublime beauty of «schwarz und stern» which he projects onto nature. With these attributes she inscribes herself into the images of Benn's poem. She insists on the authenticity of the aesthetic experience in the sexual encounter and opposes the appropriation of sexuality for his individ ual poetic fantasies. Thus she explores several images and tests their capacities to cultivate a common ground for both partners.</page><page sequence="18">60 Dorotbee Ostmeier In the poem «Giselheer dem Tiger» - first published 28 August 1913 (1.2:193) - the beloved is accepted as a threat, as a tiger with the face of a jungle and as Indian chief. With his menacing beauty - as a kind of homme fatale - he continues to attract and enchant his lover. This poem functions as a response to Benn's «Drohungen.» The lover in Benn's poem rejects the ad vances of the beloved. But what he interprets as repulsive sexuality she, in contrast, presents as attractive: Über dein Gesicht schleichen die Dschungeln. O, wie du bist! Deine Tigeraugen sind süß geworden In der Sonne. Ich trag dich immer herum Zwischen den Zähnen. Du mein Indianerbuch, Wild West, Siouxhäuptling! Im Zwielicht schmachte ich Gebunden am Buxbaumstamm - Ich kann nicht mehr sein Ohne das Scalpspiel. Rote Küsse malen deine Messer Auf meine Brust — Bis mein Haar an deinem Gürtel flattert. (1.1:145,146) The «I» adjusts to the perception of the lover as tiger and presents itself as a dam taking care of her cub. The jeopardy implicit in Benn's line «Man faßt mit Zähnen, wonach man sich sehnt» is turned into a positive and caring image. Ultimately, however, female domination is transformed into sexual submission. This issue of changing sexual attitudes is linked to changing per spectives. «Gesicht» can be read as face, but also as vision. Lasker-Schiiler redesigns the lover's poetic vision when her «I» identifies him as «Indianer buch» in which both of them function as central figures: he as Indian chief and she as his victim. His massacre maims her body and he takes her hair as trophy. The association of «Messer» and «Küsse» ties this enactment of domination and submission to erotic pleasure. The «I» accepts its depend ence on torture. «Ich kann nicht mehr sein / Ohne das Scalpspiel.» Masoch ism here is perhaps not a form of psychic disorder, as Freud describes it, but an accepted part of sexual play. By setting up this consensual sadomasochistic scenario, Lasker-Schüler frees the terms masochism and sadism from solely pejorative connotations.31</page><page sequence="19">Beastly Love 61 In other poems, too, Lasker-Schüler redesigns conventional sexual concep tions and practices by blending traditional erotic metaphors with antirealis tic, bold and abstruse32 imagery. «Das Lied des Spielprinzen,»33 for example, ends with grotesque images of physical invasion and consumption: Und in deines Kinnes Grube Bau ich mir ein Raubnest - Bis du mich aufgefressen hast. Find dann einmal morgens Nur noch meine Kniee, Zwei gelbe Skarabäen für eines Kaisers Ring. (1.1:153) Here Lasker-Schüler rewrites an image of the poem «Schöne Jugend» from Benn's Morgue cycle, where the decaying corpse of a young girl serves as nourishment for young rats that are later killed by the physicians. Benn de scribes the rotting corpse in detail as «Laube,» as an ideal home for the young rats, and irritates the expectations of the readers by applying the term «schöne Jugend» to the rats instead of to the «Mädchen.» With self-irony Lasker-Schüler's «I» assigns the role of the rats to itself and her lover. The last stanza ends with an enigmatic catachresis. The beloved can scarcely wait for her demolition and for her transformation into sacred relics - into Scarabaeuses - symbolizing her love. The play of tender love turns into a carnivorous rendezvous in which the partners feed on each other. The «I» engages in a sadomasochistic relationship when it invades the body of its partner on one hand and allows itself to by consumed by the partner on the other. Lasker-Schüler explores the «Raub»-metaphor further in the poem «Hö re!:»34 Ich raube in den Nächten Die Rosen deines Mundes, Daß keine Weibin Trinken findet. Die dich umarmt, Stiehlt mir von meinen Schauern, Die ich um deine Glieder malte. Ich bin dein Wegrand. Die dich streift, Stürzt ab. Fühlst du mein Lebtum Überall Wie ferner Saum? (1.1:172)</page><page sequence="20">62 Dorothee Ostmeier The «I» designs new aesthetic contours of the partner's «Glieder»; thus the love encounter enhances the partner's body. The metaphoric conver sion of the body into a topographical terrain fashions the transient into a per manent encounter. For her the sexual encounter has lasting consequences. Enshrining herself into his existence, she insists that his appeal is due to her and that other lovers have no right to it. By loving him, others would ex ploit her. In «Hinter Bäumen berg ich mich» (December 1913) the «I» re calls, «Ich schenkte dir die Levkoje / Meines Leibes, / Alle meine Schmet terlinge scheuchte ich / In deinen Garten» (1.1:151). Love beautifies the life of the partner but also entitles the lover to exercise her power to seize and victimize her partner: «Ich raube in den Nächten / Die Rosen deines Mundes» - Lasker-Schüler breaks here with a one-sided view of women as masochistic and introduces a dominating and scheming female as well. In «Lauter Diamant» - first published 9 May 1914 and later in 1917 with the dedication «An Gisel,» a reference to Benn (1.2:208) - the female lover re veals that she also utilized his «Herzfleisch» for fashioning her own identity: «Da ich mich schnitzte / Aus Deinem Herzfleisch» (1.1:173). Thus the ident ity, charm and attraction of each partner are tied to the appropriation of the other. Lasker-Schüler adds homoeroticism to the sadomasochistic sexual scena rio. At times the play of domination and submission obscures gender duality when the female «I» presents itself as male. In the poem «Giselheer dem Kna ben» — first published August 1913 - she suggests: «Wir spielen König und Prinz» (1.1:150). Here she utilizes a motif which she had already explored be fore her relationship to Benn. In «Dem Barbaren» she had introduced herself as «Joseph,» who wears a cute («süßen») belt (1.1:135), suggesting a ho moerotic relationship between the two Biblical figures Pharaoh and Joseph. In another poem entitled «Pharao und Joseph» - first published in 1910 and dedicated to Benn in publications between 1917 and 1920 (cf. 1.2:158) - Jo seph takes over the position of Pharaoh's wives and replaces their garden fra grances with «Korngeruch.» This poem views homosexual unity as the basis for joint poetic production and presents a rare example of harmony between the «I» and the «you.» The dedication to Benn should perhaps be viewed as an accusation that he violated this early ideal of harmony. Joseph and Pharaoh are synesthetically linked: Joseph «strömt Korngeruch aus,» and «Pharao ist von Gold.» They are also united physically (stanza 4), ethically (stanza 5, 6) and by their poetic inspiration (7, 8). The physical integration turns into poetic inspiration:</page><page sequence="21">Beastly Love 63 Sein Herz aber liegt in meinem Blut. Zehn Wölfe gingen an meine Tränke. Immer denkt Pharao An meine Brüder, Die mich in die Grube warfen. Säulen werden im Schlafe seine Arme Und drohen. Aber sein träumerisch Herz Rauscht auf meinem Grund. Darum dichten meine Lippen Große Süßigkeiten, Im Weizen unseres Morgens. (1.1:120) Pharaoh's defense of Joseph marks the transition from the literal to the me taphoric connotations of «Herz» und «Blut.» Pharaoh's «träumerisches Herz rauscht» and provides the inspiration for Joseph's articulation of the «Rausch.» Lasker-Schüler emphasizes the causal relation between the last two stanzas. The demonstrative particle «darum» marks Pharaoh's dream as the cause for Joseph's poetry. The poetic voice is a shared voice. Joseph gives up control over the poetic process without surrendering to free association, as Benn's Rönne does. Instead he credits the partner's dream for the inspiration. With her poetic conceptualizations of sexual practices Lasker-Schüler chal lenges and perhaps parodies stereotypical roles of contemporary patriarchal discourses. She at times portrays sexuality as sadomasochistic pleasure and frees it from gender constructs. Whereas Benn in the last Alaska poem separ ates sadistic love from a very poetic - i.e., abstract — love, Lasker-Schüler poe tically redesigns standard sexual practices. Interested in solving the tensions between the lovers, her poetic «I» adjusts to the implications of the male threat and models its actions accordingly. Instead of embracing the partner, the «I» exhausts his body («Bau ich mir ein Raubnest»). She responds to the male threat by adopting a threatening pose. The reconfigurations of gender roles and sexual practices are poetic attempts to end the separateness between the partners; her poems mediate between the literal and poetic realities of sex. Benn, in contrast, designs two different concepts of sexuality and opposes its literal violence through its poetic transcendence. The first poem of Benn's Söhne cycle, «Der junge Hebbel,»35 sharply re futes Lasker-Schüler's poetic concept of a personal symbiosis as well as his own concept of sexuality as poetic transcendence. The «I» declares: Ich bin mir noch sehr fern. Aber ich will Ich werden!</page><page sequence="22">64 Dorothee Ostmeier Ich trage einen tief im Blut, der schreit nach seinen selbsterschaffenen Götterhimmeln und Menschenerden. - (G 59) All interpersonal alliances are dismissed and the attention shifts to an intra personal split between the actual «I» and its idealistic future prospect. The blood gains a voice and longs for its own authentic creativity and inde pendence. The «I» in the poem «Hier ist kein Trost» insists on its seclusion: «Keiner wird mein Wegrand sein. / Laß deine Blüten nur verblühen. / Mein Weg flutet und geht allein» (G 70).36 Both poets scrutinize eroticism and sex uality in terms of physical landscapes, nature and animalistic features but use these images for different ends. Benn considers not the beauty of the «Blüten» but their decay. Further on in his journey to an ideal Homeric landscape Benn's poetic «I» leaves other human beings behind: [...] Ich schluchze immer vorbei an Brüsten und Gebeinen den tyrrhenischen Inseln zu: Dämmert ein Tal mit weißen Pappeln ein Illyssos mit Wiesenufern Eden und Adam und eine Erde aus Nihilismus und Musik. — (G 70) He literally passes the exhausted and devoured bodies which recall the dis torted bodies of the morgue, the body of the beloved, and mythological figures of the inferno. This journey is also a search for a distance from his partner and her images. The new envisioned landscape is clearly marked «male,» representing the «I's» cultural roots in Greek37 and Christian myth ology and nihilism, poetry and music. This poetic alternative favors the cul tural domain over the personal; in fact, it is conceived as an escape from the personal. The last poem of the volume Söhne, «Schnellzug,» goes a step fur ther. Disillusioned with the idealistic and Utopian conception of the «I» in «Der junge Hebbel,» it focusses on the transience of personal and cultural ex periences, on «Das Gleitende, das in den Fenstern steht» (G 71). The dynamic movement of the train is analogous to the son's maturation, his departure from everything familiar, from the home landscape, from home villages and from parents. The son's nakedness, indeed, not his alone but that of a gener ation, marks this departure from the past: Von meinen Schultern blättern die Gefilde, die Lauben und die zugewachsenen Dörfer; verschollene Mütter; das ganze Land</page><page sequence="23">Beastly Love 65 ein Grab voll Väter: - nun sind die Söhne groß und prunken mit der roten Götterstirne, nackt und im Taumel des entbundenen Bluts. - (G 71) Nakedness here denotes freedom from civilization through a glamorized di vine identity and its delirious vitality. But the last stanza calms the sons' ex uberance and presents this freedom itself as transitory. The present tense of «nun sind die Söhne groß» shifts to the past: «Die Söhne wurden groß.» The last stanza revises the last image of the first stanza: «Die Söhne gehn / nackt und im Grame des entbundenen Bluts, / die Stirn aufrötet fern ein Abgrund glück» (G 71). «Taumel» is replaced by «Grame,» and «Glück» is paradoxi cally based on the experience of the risks of the abyss. «Rot,» an adjective which describes the forehead of the sons in the first stanza, turns into a verb in the last. As a verb it is doubly energized through its inchoate action on one hand and the intensifying particle «auf» on the other. Subject and object of the action are not defined; grammatically the subject can function as object and the object as subject. Thus the sons lose their divine position of control. This abyss, previously identified as a chasm between the lovers, is now seen as part of the sons' own constitution. Their nakedness takes on a different connotation: the sons are vulnerable while they are exposed to the paradox of «Abgrund-glück.» The multidirectional adverb «fern» designs a lasting fu ture perspective for this situation. Yet the longing for a lover, the focus of stanza 3, is only a transitional desire. Lasker-Schüler's poem «Hinter Bäumen berg' ich mich,» first published December 25,1913, casts a retrospective glance at the relationship, contrast ing the «I's» lament and anguish about the loss of the partner with the optim istic images of the past. Her weeping is described as a physical and figurative process of negotiation between the present and the past. The lover's image is inscribed into the «I's» glances and views. The poem was republished with the title «Dem Abtrünnigen» in April 1914 (1.2:199-200). The constant shift between past and present tenses indicates the struggle to redesign her percep tions of the partnership. In stanzas 3 to 8 the beloved is depicted as a prosper ing garden, and later attacked in stanza 11 as «falscher Gaukler.» The exten sively elaborated garden metaphor is suspended and replaced by a series of abrupt singular images: Ich schlang meine Arme um dich Wie Gerank; Bin doch mit dir verwachsen, Warum reißt du mich von dir? Ich schenkte dir die Levkoje Meines Leibes,</page><page sequence="24">66 Dorothee Ostmeier Alle meine Schmetterlinge scheuchte ich In deinen Garten. Immer ging ich durch Granaten, Sah durch mein Blut Die Welt überall brennen Vor Liebe. Schlage mit der Stirn nun Meine Tempelwände düster. (1.1:151-52) The fantasies of the past link the sexual encounter between the lovers to an aesthetically pleasing garden scene. «Arme» are compared with «Gerank,» and the female body is equated with a «Levkoje.» The images are charged with literal meaning. This harmonious perception of the partnership is bru tally subverted by its transformation into a battlefield. Beauty turns into threat, but for a while the «I» ignores the dangers and interprets the most de structive moments idealistically as most comforting. Lasker-Schüler quotes 17th- and 18th-century pansophic models of harmonia mundi, positing sym pathy among all beings: «Sah durch mein Blut / Die Welt überall brennen / Vor Liebe.» But she contrasts the aesthetically pleasing play of the rhyme «Garten» and «Granaten»38 with its disturbing connotations and inscribes absurd tensions between poetic form and meaning, between garden and war imagery, into the partnership. The «du» is associated with shellfire. It viol ently disrupts the sympathetic images of the «I.» The «I» asks, «Warum reißt du mich von dir?» The harmonious ambitions of the «I» are smashed, and Lasker-Schüler gives up images informed by the tradition of «Erlebnislyrik.» She ceases her exploration of one metaphoric context and exposes disjointed perspectives citing different poetic conventions. She jumps from the personal attack to sentimental and expressionist phrases («Mein rot Fahrzeug / Pocht grausig») and concludes with the familiar nautical metaphor of sailing for the new insecurity of her life: «Bin immer auf See / O, ich fühl, ich lande nie» (1.1:152).39 Contrasting the erotic closeness of the past partnership, the poetic garden scene, with the isolation of the poet, she resists reviving the ear lier poetry based on such similes as «Ich schlang meine Arme um dich / Wie Gerank.» Erotic frustration is here intimately linked to a crisis with the poetic functions of language. The last lines point to the horror of having lost the partner, of losing his image and one's own poetic ability to perceive. She introduces the temple as an image for harmonious fantasies about the sexual partnership which blend literal and metaphoric associations. The destruction of this sacred sanctuary sabotages the poetic approach towards love. The poem «O ich möcht aus der Welt!,» dedicated to Benn in the Gesammelte</page><page sequence="25">Beastly Love 67 Gedichte editions from 1917 to 1920 (1.1:190; 1.2:230), explicitly links Las ker-Schüler's disillusionment with the partnership to a crisis with the poetic functions of language. Posing a death wish, the «I» longs for an ultimate re sponse from Benn her former lover. She recognizes his presence as a wishful fantasy - «Träume kriegerisch» - that threatens her own composure and inte grity: O ich möcht aus der Welt! Dann weinst du um mich Blutbuchen schüren Meine Träume kriegerisch Durch finster Gestrüpp Muß ich Und Gräben und Wasser Immer schlägt wilde Welle An mein Herz, Innerer Feind. O ich möcht aus der Welt! [...] (1.1:190-91) Her heart is vulnerable to her own fantasies, and by not being able to restrain the inner turmoil, she is subjected to an inner war. The war imagery connects the furor of the dreams with their visions of «finster Gestrüpp,» «wilde Welle» and «innerer Feind.» Lasker-Schüler's dedication addresses the «Dok tor Benn» of her dreams («Meinem Doktor Benn») and thus of her poetry al though she is haunted by these dreams and longs to escape from them. Whereas the «Söhne» in Benn's «Schnellzug» surpass their erotic desires, re vealing them as transitional, for Lasker-Schüler's «I» the loss of the dreams and their images have a lasting effect, marking the psyche with a death wish. With the transition from the real to the fictional Benn she thematizes the un settling and disturbing tensions between the real and the imagined «du.» In searching for a poetic dialogue and a shared imagery with her lover, Lasker Schüler faces personal, poetic and metaphysical isolation: Ich möchte aus der Welt! Aber auch fern von ihr Irr ich ein Flackerlicht Um Gottes Grab. (1.1:191) Lasker-Schüler refers the experience of the «we» to a prelinguistic encounter, while Benn's Alaska cycle climaxes in the celebration of a poetic «we.» In the last poem Benn abstracts the encounter from «I» and «You.» He contrasts</page><page sequence="26">68 Dorothee Ostmeier two concepts of sexuality: physically destructive and violent intercourse with the passionate delirium of the «we.» But here the «I» is radically excluded. This distinction between the two sexualities is analogous to the differentia tion of poetic languages. Benn distinguishes metaphoric and literal speech while Lasker-Schüler unifies both modes. Benn identifies and celebrates the conception of the «we.» Lasker-Schüler, in contrast, describes the intentions of the «I» and projects the «I's» percep tions on the partner. Emptying «you» and «I» of fixed references, Benn ex plores the beastly features of the «I,» its threat and enigma, and the contradic tory attractions of the «you.» He fashions both partners as abysses and empty signs, while Lasker-Schüler insists on the continuing identity of both. The poem «Drohungen» already identifies this difference when the lover no tices that the beloved keeps ties to her humanness, to the differentiation of «I» and «you.» For Lasker-Schüler the «and» has a different meaning. She imagines physical incorporation or the merging of «I» and «you,» whereas Benn traces common prehistorical roots in the sexual act. The inscription of preindividual and paléontologie life forms onto the sexual encounter de-ani mates and de-individualizes sexuality. As a prelinguistic reference, the «we» remains the desired unspoken center of the poems of both authors. Thus memory and its poetic reflection distract from the actual encounter. In Lasker-Schüler's case it is the memory of a per sonal experience and the attempt to recapture it, in Benn's case this memory actualizes and stimulates a scientifically mediated memory of prehistoric roots. It detects the most individual as the most physically collective relation ship. Benn retreats into poetic fantasy which allows him to leave the beloved in «Mann» and to replace her with the fantasy of a secularized «Madonna» who pleases and fulfills his desires. The last poem of the volume Söhne ex presses disillusionment also with this pleasure. This poetic controversy between the two poets might illuminate the dis tinction between Lasker-Schüler as the «New Woman»40 of the avantgarde and Benn's patriarchal aestheticsm. Lasker-Schüler divorced Bertholt Lasker in November 1903 and her second husband, Herwarth Waiden, the founder of the leading expressionist journal, Der Sturm, in November 1912, during the time of her intimate encounter with Benn. She did not remarry. She fled the patriarchal bourgeois milieu and immersed herself in bohemian life. Benn left the avant-garde scene, married three times and retreated into a bourgeois lifestyle, separating his artistic from his professional and private interests.41 Such radical separation is perhaps most clearly expressed in a letter to Oelze written five months after his marriage to his second wife, Herta von Wede meyer: «Meine Frau ist zart, verfeinert, sehr degeneriert, was mir sehr ange</page><page sequence="27">Beastly Love 69 nehm ist.

Gesammelte Werke in der Fassung der Erstdrucke, ed. Bruno Hillebrand, 4 vols. (Frankfun: Fischer, 1984-1986) and Else Lasker-Schüler, Werke und Briefe. Kritische Ausgabe, ed. Norben Oellers, Heinz Rölleke und Itta Shedletzky, vols. 1.1,1.2,3.1 and 3.2 (Frankfurt: Jüdischer Verlag, 1996 and 1998.). The four volumes of the Benn edition are cited as G (= Gedichte), P (= Prosa und Autobiographie), S (= Szenen und Schriften) and E (= Essays und Reden). The four volumes of the Lasker-Schüler edition used here are cited by volume number: 1.1 (= Gedichte), 1.2 (= Gedichte. Anmerkungen), 3.1 (= Prosa 1903-1920), 3.2 (= Prosa 1903 1920. Anmerkungen). 1 Die Aktion 25 June 1913: 639-642. The first part of Benn's cycle had been published in the same journal four months earlier on 26 February 1913:269-270. 2 In the absence of more specific information, biographers of both authors pragmatically adhere to 1912 as an approximate date for the beginning of the relationship. See Hille brand, «Werkbiographie zur Lyrik» (G 594); Sigrid Bauschinger, «Zeittafel,» Else Las ker-Schüler. Ihr Werk und ihre Zeit (Heidelberg: Lothar Stiehm, 1980) 356. There are different views about the exact beginning of the love encounter. The dates given by the commentators of Else Lasker-Schüler Werke und Briefe differ slightly: Ricarda Dick dates the friendship between the two poets «um 1911/1912» (3.2:246) and Karl Jürgen Skrodzki and Norbert Oellers speak about 1912 (1.2:193). Bauschinger interprets some of Lasker-Schüler's texts as allusions to Benn. When Lasker-Schüler writes in her epi stolary series Briefe nach Norwegen in February 1912 - «Ich bin verliebt. - Herwarth, Kurthchen, er sagt, er hätte breite Hände. Ich finde seine Hände wundervoll und rührend, kleine Kinderhände [...] Ich spiele den ganzen Tag mit seinen Händen» (3.1:249) - Bauschinger identifies the beloved as Benn. See Else Lasker-Schüler, Werke, ed. Sigrid Bauschinger (München: Artemis &amp;C Winkler, 1991) 501. However, she ignores Lasker-Schüler's references to the chronology of the relationship in «Doktor Benn» in dating the start of the relationship prior to the appearance of Benn's Morgue. In «Doktor Benn» Lasker-Schüler writes, «Lang bevor ich ihn kannte, war ich seine Leserin, sein Gedichtbuch - Morgue - lag auf meiner Decke: Grauenvolle Kunstwunder, Todes träumerei, die Kontur annahm» (3.1:277). Hermann J. Fohsel, Im Wartesaal der Poesie. Zeit- und Sittenbilder aus dem Cafe des Westens und dem Romanischen Cafe (Berlin: Das Arsenal, 1996) 50, claims that Benn and Lasker-Schüler met at the end of 1912 in Berlin's famous Cafe des Westens, a vibrant center of modernist avant-garde art, lit erature and journalism. In their detailed chronology Else Lasker-Schüler 1869-1945 (Marbach: Deutsche Schillergesellschaft, 1995; 3rd revised ed. 1997), Erika Klüsener and Friedrich Pfäfflin date the intimate relationship from ca. August 1912 to Fall 1913 fol lowing a most disappointing meeting in Hiddensee in September 1913 (92 and 112). Klüsener and Pfäfflin record further sporadic but cordial contacts between the poets in January 1918 (141), December 1927 (209), September and November 1931 (219) and De cember 1932 (232).</page><page sequence="28">70 Dorothee Ostmeier 3 Recent secondary literature has discussed the parallel imagery of the two poets. Cf. Wer ner Dürrson, «Der Seltsamsaft. Zu Else Lasker-Schülers Einfluß auf die Lyrik von Gott fried Benn,» Denken in Widersprüchen. Korrelarien zur Gottfried-Benn-Forschung, ed. Wolfgang Peitz (Freiburg: Universitätsverlag Becksmann, n.d.) 184-204; Bauschinger, Else Lasker-Schüler 130-134; Klaus Theweleit, «The Politics of Orpheus Between Women, Hades, Political Power and the Media: Gottfried Benn or: What Happens to Eurydice?» NGC 36 (1985): 133-156; Helma Sanders-Brahms, Gottfried Benn und Else Lasker-Schüler: Giselheer und Prinz Jussuf (Berlin: Rowolt, 1997). Dürrson's study of Benn's reception of Lasker-Schüler elucidates his innovations based on her work but simplifies and essentializes gender issues by distinguishing the «feminine» sensitive tone of Lasker-Schüler's work from the «masculine» parodistic character of Benn's (186,188, 194). Bauschinger rightly cautions against relating poetry and biography directly (132). Sanders-Brahms speculates suggestively about Benn's psyche, his obsession with his mother (102), his abuse of Lasker-Schüler's imagery for his own poetry (116), his prag matic conservatism and egocentrism (100), and his ostensible homoerotic tendencies (59). Nevertheless she notes that until Lasker-Schüler's death in her exile in Palestine, Benn remained for her «die Personifikation dessen, was sie in ihrer ersten Heimat, Deutschland, geliebt und gehaßt hat» (179). Sanders-Brahms phrases must be read criti cally. By means of adverbs such as «sicher,» «wahrscheinlich,» and «womöglich» she shifts all too readily from factual descriptions and quotations to unfounded speculations, and her dating of materials and events is at times unreliable. 4 Sanders-Brahms refers to the etymology of the syllable «gisel» when she explains: «Gisel - das ist für sie der Gespiele, das Kind, der Knabe - Giselher, das ist der im germanischen Sinne Zerstörerische und Selbstzerstörerische» (64-65). 5 The schematic overview of the volume in 1.2:30 lists twenty-seven poems following the prose text «Doktor Benn.» In the 1917 edition of Die gesammelten Gedichte as well as in Die Kuppel of 1920 there are no formal markers that support the editors of the Kriti sche Ausgabe in their tacit assumption that the cycle encompasses only the first eleven poems (1.2:194). Sigrid Bauschinger expands the list on semantic criteria alone to include five poems («Wo mag der Tod mein Herz lassen,» «Von weit,» «Palmenlied» and two distinct poems with the title «Dem Barbaren») written before 1912. Four of them were included in the Gottfried Benn cycle in both Die gesammelten Gedichte and Die Kuppel (Else Lasker-Schüler, Werke [München: Artemis Winkler, 1991] 453. The fifth poem «Palmenlied» was only included in the 1919 and 1920 editions of Die gesammelten Ge dichte and in Die Kuppel; it is missing in the edition of 1917.1 discuss mostly poems first published during Lasker-Schüler's romantic involvement with Gottfried Benn between 1912 and 1913, which reflect on, elaborate, and revise images or motifs both authors ex changed. Although we can identify the publication dates of the poems, we do not know which poems and images the poets might have exchanged beforehand. Few examples from the time before and after their relationship - «Pharao und Joseph» (1910), «Lauter Diamant» (1914), «O ich möcht aus der Welt» (1917) - indicate changes and shifts in the conceptualization of the images. However I do not see any reason for limiting the Gott fried Benn cycle to these poems. The poems which were composed before and after the love affair establish a larger, more general context for the debate between the lovers. Their topics - artistic and poetic production, love, leave taking and mourning - are also relevant for Lasker-Schüler's specific Gottfried Benn poems. 6 The Alaska and Söhne cycles both contain the following poems: «Wir gerieten in ein Mohnfeld» (G 43, 60), «Don Juan gesellte sich zu uns» (G 45,63), «Vor einem Kornfeld</page><page sequence="29">Beastly Love 71 sagte einer» (G 46,64), «Drohungen» (Söhne contains only the first stanza, and the poem is called «Drohung») (G 49, 66), «Der Räuber - Schiller» with the new title «Räuber Schiller» in Söhne (G 51,68), «Madonna» (G 53,69). The cycle Söhne includes also «Der junge Hebbel» (G 59), «Ein Trupp hergelaufener Söhne schrie» (G 61), «Mutter» (65), «Ein Mann spricht: / Hier ist kein Trost» (67). Gerhard Schuster lists eight additional poems as belonging to the volume Söhne in Gottfried Benn, Sämtliche Werke, Stuttgar ter Ausgabe in Verbindung mit Ilse Benn, ed. Gerhard Schuster (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1986) 1.1:346-47. This information corresponds to Benn's original volume Söhne: Neue Gedichte (Berlin-Wilmersdorf: A.R. Meyer, 1913) and demonstrates that Hillebrand's republication and commentary is incomplete when he identifies only two of these poems as part of the Söhne volume (G 518). 7 The individual letters (3.1:179-261) were originally published between September 1911 and June 1912 in Der Sturm and then republished in Mein Herz, the book version of these «Briefe» which appeared in early November 1912 (cf. 3.2:177). The commentary mistakenly relates Benn's dedication to Morgue, his first volume of poetry, rather than Söhne, his second (3.2:223). 8 Jürgen Schröder, «&lt;Der junge Hebbeb. Die Sozio- und Psychogenese des Künstlers,» Gottfried Benn: Poesie und Sozialisation (Stuttgart, Berlin, Köln, Mainz: Kohlhammer, 1978) 48-62, here 57. 9 Lasker-Schüler euphorically celebrates his dedication in public letters to Franz Marc published October 1913 in Die Aktion (cf. 3.2:256). «Franz, du! Gestern hatte ich eine große Freude, der Cyclop Dr. Gottfried Benn hat mir seine neuen Verse: Söhne, gewid met, die sind mondrot, erdhart, wilder Dämmer, Gehämmer im Blut» (3.1:311). This portrayal of his poetry takes up images she introduced earlier in the essayistic prose poem «Doktor Benn» (3.1:277). 10 Gottfried Benn, Briefe an F.W.Oelze 1950-1956, Briefe!Gottfried Benn, Vol.2 pt.2, ed. Harald Steinhagen and Jürgen Schröder (Wiesbaden, München: Limes, 1980) 128. 11 In her epistolary series Briefe nach Norwegen Lasker-Schüler's signature shifts from her authentic name to «Tino von Bagdad» (3.1:227,249), «Der Prinz» (3.1:256), «Euer Prinz von Theben»(3.1:261) and «Jussuf-Prinz» (3.2:191). In the subsequent series Briefe und Bilder she regularly signed the letters to Franz Marc with various versions of the fic tional name Prinz Jussuf (3.1:299-359). 12 Jakob Hessing, Die Heimkehr einer jüdischen Emigrantin: Else Lasker-Schülers mythi sierende Rezeption (Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1993) 28-35, critically examines this speech and views it as an attempt by Benn to distance himself from his past Nazi associations. 13 For more details see Bruno Hillebrand, «Biographie» (E 723—44, esp. 728-30) and «Zum essayistischen Werk von Gottfried Benn» (E 745-85, esp. 762-65) 14 See Bauschinger, Else Lasker-Schüler 251-52. 15 Werner Dürrson suggests that some lines of this metaphoric speech allude to rhythm, sound and motifs of Lasker-Schüler's poems. He speaks of Benn's feminine style (185-86). 16 Cf. Dieter Lamping, Moderne Lyrik. (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1991) 28 37. Lamping defines here «absolute Metapher» and refers to more detailed discussions of the term by Hendrik Birus/Anna Fuchs, Hans Blumenberg and Wolfgang Preisendanz. 17 Emile Benveniste, «The Nature of Pronouns,» Problems in General Linguistics (Coral Gables: Miami UP, 1971) 219. 18 This reading of the last stanza stresses its ongoing dialogic function. Grammatically the last part of the stanza is ambiguous. «Mein Blut» and «du» could also be read as self-ref erential, i.e., the speaker withdraws from the dialogue and turns to a poetic soliloquy in</page><page sequence="30">72 Dorothee Ostmeier which he presents himself as the barren landscape. This radical isolation would stress the separation from the partner but undermines his assertion of dominance over the partner. 19 These physical and sexual connotations contrast strikingly with Caspar David Fried rich's romanticized Kreidefelsen auf Rügen which introduces the meditative perspecti ves of three figures towards the boundless grandeur of immense natural thresholds as the supernatural. Cf. Robert Rosenblum, «Friedrichs From Russia: An Introduction,» The Romantic Vision of Caspar David Friedrich: Paintings and Drawings from the U.S.S.R., ed. Sabine Rewald (New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1990) 3-16, esp. 8. 20 Poem II polemically quotes and associates two Biblical texts (Gen. 11, Exod. 32) which describe Israel's rejection of God. Benn universalizes these Biblical revolts. Even bricks announce their opposition against forms of divine authority: «Baut uns mit in den Turm des Feuers / Für alles, was vor Göttern kniet» (G 43). They want to be added to the fire in order to destroy all kinds of religious devotion. The Bacchanal celebrations liberate death from its threatening functions and associate poppy field, death and rainbow as im ages for ecstasy and enchantment. These images undermine the Western abstract ca tegories of reason, purpose and meaning. Poems V and X expose female sexuality as the only route for a man. The course to Alaska leads to intercourse between lovers. Poppy motifs relate the female sexual body to the scene of the destruction of Judeo-Christian ideology in poem II. «Wir gerieten in ein Mohnfeld» could be read as «we entered femi ninity.» From this perspective - considering the dance and poppy motifs in poems II, V and XII - the dance of the «rote Heiden» (G 43) turns into an image for the dance of inner bodily liquids. Sexual arousal and warmth call Judeo-Christian values, concepts of sin, meaning and purpose, radically into question. 21 He focusses on the motif of the cup which mediates the anagnorisis between Joseph and his brothers. In such poems as «Dem Barbaren» (1.1:134—135) and «Pharao and Joseph» (1.1:120) Lasker-Schüler presents the lyrical «I» in the role of Joseph. Lasker-Schüler's general fascination with the Orient and its fashion were also stimulated by such cultural events in Berlin as Max Reinhardts staging of Sumurün: Eine Pantomime nach orientali schen Märchenmotiven (premiere on 24 April 1910 in Kammerspiele des Deutschen Theaters) and archeological discoveries in Egypt and their exhibition in Berlin. Serge Di aghilev and his «Ballets Russes'» premiered the one-act ballet Josephslegende with music by Richard Strauss and the libretto by Harry Kessler and Hugo von Hofmannsthal in 1914. (Sanders-Brahms 60, 63; Heinrich Huesmann, «Inszenierungen,» Welttheater Reinhardt: Bauten, Spielstätten, Inszenierungen (München: Prestel, 1983) 161-415, esp. entries 476, 477; Militsa Pozharskaya, Tatiana Volodina, The Art of The Ballets Russes: The Russian Seasons in Paris 1908-29 (London: Aurum Press, 1990) 19-20,266. 22 Cf. Sanders-Brahms 86. 23 There is no systematic study of Benn's specific knowledge of ethnological and evol utionary theories. Benn mentions Darwin once in his radio presentation «Die neue lite rarische Saison» (1931). Peter Schüneman, Gottfried Benn (München: C.H. Beck, edi tion + kritik, 1977) 62, points to Benn's study of Edgar Dacque's work Urwelt, Sage und Menschheit which was published in the early Twenties. In German Expressionism: Primitivism and Modernity (New Haven, London: Yale UP, 1991) Jill Lloyd gives a thorough overview of the reception of primitive cultures by expressionist writers and artists, but she does not mention Gottfried Benn. I would argue that Benn in his early poetry superficially associates various ideas of origin without referring to specific theories.</page><page sequence="31">Beastly Love 73 24 The twelve Alaska poems do not always express directly the deliberations of the «I.» They are designed as songs and quote remarks of anonymous (poem III and V) or leg endary companions (Don Juan in poem IV, and Schiller's «Räuber» in poem IX), or de scribe a scenery (poem II). Thus the «I» is exposed to various male perspectives towards women and sexuality before he himself engages in a dialogue with his beloved in poems VIII, XI and XII. 25 Cf. «Ich steh an deiner Krippen hier,» a Christmas hymn by Paul Gerhardt and set to music by Johann Sebastian Bach. Stanza 4 stresses the theology of salvation: «Ich lag in tiefer Todesnacht, du wurdest meine Sonne.» Another example is the religious folk song and lullaby «Der Mond ist aufgegangen» by Matthias Claudius, especially stanza 6: «Wollst endlich sonder Grämen aus dieser Welt uns nehmen durch einen sanften Tod: und wenn du uns genommen, laß uns in Himmel kommen, du unser Herr und Gott.» Evangelisches Gesangbuch für Rheinland und Westfalen (Dortmund: Verlag W. Crü well, 1950) 353-54, *12. 26 Cf. Volker Meid, «Das 17. Jahrhundert,» Geschichte der deutschen Lyrik vom Mittlealter bis zur Gegenwart, ed. Walter Hinderer (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1983) 74-138, here 103. 27 Kautski introduces here the images of the «southern complex» which has often been dis cussed in relation to Benn's later work. For a general overview of the secondary lit erature see Hugh Ridley, Gottfried Benn (Opladen: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1990) 76ff. 28 Cf. For the sublime connotations of «Wald» and «Frieden» motifs see Josepf von Ei chendorff's poems «Waldeinsamkeit,» «Der Einsiedler,» «Abschied,» Gedichte und Ver sepen, ed. Hartwig Schultz (Frankfurt a.M.: Deutscher Klassiker Verlag, 1987) 313, 322, 346,383. «Frieden» can be associated with the motifs «stiller Wald,» «Waldeinsamkeit,» «Sternenkleid» (313-14), «Trost,» «stille Nacht,» «stiller Wald» (322), and with «an dächtger Aufenthalt,» «stilles ernstes Wort» (346). 29 Cf. Dieter Lamping's short review of the theoretical debate over «Erlebnislyrik» in Das lyrische Gedicht (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1989) 102-10. 30 This last stanza was added to the poem - first published in August 1913 - in the 1917 edition of the Gottfried Benn cycle (1.2:204). 31 Cf. Jessica Benjamin's theory as it is paraphrased by Carol Siegel, Male Masochism: Modern Revisions of the Story of Love, (Bloomington, Indianapolis: Indiana UP, 1995) 5. Siegel points to an interesting paradox: in general, masochism is portrayed as unnatural for members of a culturally dominant group, but as essential for members of oppressed groups, for women, homosexual men, etc. It is her goal to free the term masochism from the pejorative connotations and to clarify «how erotic submission has come to be seen as un natural in one particular situation, the very one in which it once signified love» (22). 32 Lamping, Das lyrische Gedicht, identifies Lasker-Schüler's poetry as the earliest manifes tations of formal and semantic modernism in the German tradition (191). 33 First published July 1913 in Die Neue Kunst (ci. 1.2:200). 34 Cf. Sanders-Brahms 106, Bauschinger 134, Dürrson 200. All authors point to the corre spondences between this poem and Benn's poem «Hier ist kein Trost.» 35 Published first in Das neue Pathos 1 (January/May 1913). Cf. G 518. 36 It is unclear whether Benn's poem responds to Lasker-Schiiler's poem «Höre!» which was first published in the 8 April 1914 issue of Die weißen Blätter (cf. 1.2:207) some even months after his poem appeared in the volume Söhne, or whether her poem, given its insistence on being «Wegrand,» responds to his. For my reading it is not necessary to decide who responds to whom since I focus generally on the differences in the use of poetic imagery in regard to the partnership.</page><page sequence="32">74 Dorothee Ostmeier 37 These references to Greek mythology demonstrate that Benn's «geschichtsphilosophi sche Orientierung» does not begin only after WWI, as Paul Requadt argues in «Gott fried Benn und das &lt;südliche Wort&gt;,» Gottfried Benn, ed. Bruno Hillebrand (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1979) 153-76, here 164. 38 This interpretation of the word «Granaten» differs from the commentary in 1.2:103 which ignores the connotations of war and focuses on the gemstone used as a jewel in the earlier poem «Der gefallene Engel» from 1902 (1.1:55). 39 For an insightful analysis of the complex connotations of this metaphor see Hans Blu menberg, Schiffbruch mit Zuschauer (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp 1988). 40 Elaine Showalter introduces this term in Sexual Anarchy. Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siècle (New York: Viking, 1990) 38-58. 41 Cf. biographical overviews by Hillebrand in G 593-615 and Bauschinger, Else Lasker Schüler 355-57. 42 Benn, Briefe an Oelze 194. In the final stages of work on this essay I have benefitted from the detailed responses of Theodore Fiedler and enjoyed our stimulating discussion of issues raised by my analyses of the poetic texts. I would like to thank him for his intense and challenging interest in my work.</page></plain_text>
