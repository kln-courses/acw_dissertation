<plain_text><page sequence="1">R.C. AGRAWALA, M.A. TWO INTERESTING SAIVA TERRACOTTAS IN THE BIKANER MUSEUM THE REGION ROUND ABOUT RANGAMAHAL, SURATGARH, HANUMANGARH, Badopol, Mundi and Pir-Sultan has yielded quite a large number of Late-Kusana or early -Gupta terracotta-plaques which have now been preserved in the Gaiiga Golden Jubilee Museum at Bikaner. All these unique representatives of the early art of Rajasthana have been described2 and illustrated by various Indian and foreign scholars. They are able to throw a flood of light on the social and religious history of this area which was watered by the sacred rivers (the Drisadvati and the Saraswati) in ancient days. It is proposed to present here a critical account of two interesting Saiva terracottas from the above lot. It is of course regretted that their iconographic details have not been pointed out by anybody so far. They may be described as follows: ( ) Siva-Parvati Relief: Most interesting, from iconographic point of view, is the piece which depicts Siva and Parvati seated side by side. It was recovered from Rafigamahal, situated about 3 miles from Suratgarh.3 The existing relief has been published by H. Goetz (op. cit., figure 4) and also in 1 In the form of baked moulded bricks. Similar finds have also been recovered from other sites of India such as from Bhita, Paharapur, Achicchatra etc. 2 Consult H. Goetz, Art and Architecture of the Bikaner State, Oxford, 1950, pp. 26-7, figures on plates I-III; Progress Report of Arch. Surv. Western Circle, Poona, 1921, pp. I 114-15; Arch.

Srivastava, Rajasthana BhdratZ, Hindi, Bikaner, IV (2-3), pp. II-I4. It is no longer possible to assign them to the first century B. C. for they appear to have been prepared somewhere in the late-Kusana or the early-Gupta period. 3 The archaeological excavations in this region have brought to light sufficient material pertaining to the Indus Valley and the Rangamahal (Kusana period) cultures. For details consult A. Ghosh's paper in the Bulletin of the National Institute of Sciences, I, 1952, pp. 37-42; Cf. also H. D. Sankalia, ibid, pp. 43-47. The ruins of Raingamahal are very extensive indeed.</page><page sequence="2">the Arch. Survey of India, Annual Report 1917- 18, Pt. I, plate XIII, 2. In this plaque, Siva has been en- dowed with two hands. The third eye on his fore- s . S,ahead can well be compared with that depicted on the contemporary Siva sculpture from Mandasora (ancient Dasapura). Besides this, the male deity here is seated on his vahana the bull, as usual. The fingers of his right hand are touching the right side portion of his chest. Besides this, a long-necked pot5 can be seen in the left hand. This vessel has been placed on his left thigh. Just above the central head of the three-headed6 Siva appears a gana7 (attendant) perhaps holding something in both the hands (or the river Gafiga jutting out of the hair Fig. I locks of Siva) while a male devotee can be seen Siva-Parvati Terracotta from Rafigamahal eated r S ght ee he hee e Bikaner Museurn seated near Siva's right knee. The three faces of Siva (one in the centre and one each on both the sides) have enhanced the grace and beauty of the relief. The dress of Siva and his afore- said male devotee also deserves reference here. Both of them wear a small dhotz which does not even come up to the knees while the side-ends of this dhotz hang between the two legs. Still more, the necklaces, the bangles... etc., on their body are in no way less attractive. As regards ParvatI (the consort of Siva), she is seated to the left of her husband. Her right For this relief from Mandasor, consult The Annual Report of Archaeology, Gwalior State, Samvat I982, p. I 2; Ancient India, Bulletin of the Archeological Survey of India, New Delhi, VI, p. 54 plate XIX B. 5 The Kosam relief (of the Gupta period) too depicts a water-vessel in the left hand of Siva.

The blending of this form and the third eye on the forehead of Siva is quite unique indeed. It is essential to search for more images of this nature. 7 A flying person can be seen even above this attendant. 62</page><page sequence="3">hand remains broken at the present moment while she is holding the typical mirror' in her left hand. This mirror is prominent because of its long handle. Uma here wears a petticoat which resembles the modern Indian ghaghara or lahanga. The vertical folds of this nether- garment are clearly visible and it hangs down to the feet of Parvati. Dr. H. Goetz (op. cit., p. 26) has remarked that this is a specimen of some 'Hellenistic costume'. But this view does not seem to carry any tangible weight. Similar type of nether-garments 9 are used by the Indian ladies even now-a-days and there is nothing foreign in this dress. A female devotee appears (to the left of Prvati) in a mood of adoration and having her hands folded and the knees bent. The dress of this female-devotee too resembles that of Parvati. Their hair decoration, ornaments... etc., are equally attractive. A pearl-necklace, in addition to the ekavalz, is hanging between the breasts of Parvati; the breast-portion being quite prominent. The importance of the relief lies mainly in the blending of the trimiirtibhava and the tminetra of Siva at so early an age. As a matter of fact, the discovery of early Uma-Maheswara images is very meagre. Reference to the Kosam relief (now preserved in the Indian Museum, Calcutta and belonging to the Gupta period), has already been made above. Besides this, there is a very early Saiva sculpture in red sand-stone which has been preserved in the Mathura Museum. It belongs to the late-Kusana period and shows Siva and Parvati standing against Nandi; Siva is ithyphallic and both he and his consort hold the rnlotpala buds in their hands (The Age of the Imperial Unity, 1951, Bombay, p. 461). But the details, as represented by the terracotta relief from Bikaner, perhaps do not appear to have been furnished by any other early piece so far published or illustrated in any of the art books or journals. (2) Siva-lihga: Another terracotta relief, to be discussed here, also hails from Raiigamahal (near Suiratgarh) and depicts the Ekamukhi form of the Sivalingas. Only a photograph of this piece has been 8 Similar type of mirror has also been depicted in another Gupta sculpture from Kaman (Bharatpur) and now preserved in the Rajputana Museum at Ajmer. Consult Prog. Report Arch. Surv. W. Circle, Poona, I919, p. 65, plate XXV, upper photograph for this sculpture from Kaman. 9 Dr. Moti Chand (Praczna Bhiaratya Vesabhisa4, Prayaga, p. 2 5) has even remarked that the lahanga first of all appears in the sculptures and art of the Kusana period in India. This carries the use of the lahahngac to very early times indeed. 63</page><page sequence="4">published by Dr. Goetz (op. it., fig. 6) who has even marked the figure as representing a "Siva-lihga under a canopy". A careful study of the image suggests that it presents something more. We have, here, a very clear depiction of the yone (female organ) symbol just above the lihga. The existing relief comes within the range of the Ekamukhi .ivali~gas.'0 The typical topknot hair and the bust of Siva have been worked out in a traditional manner. Still more inter- esting, to be noticed here, is the de- Fig. 2 * piction ofa third eye marked vertically1l iva-liiga Terracotta from Rafingamahal n Bikaner Museum on Siva's head as also in the previous plaque. The existing relief too was found at Raigamahal and not at Badopol as stated by Dr. Goetz. It depicts a female chowri - bearer to the right and some male gana (attendant) to the left. Dr. Goetz (op. cit., p. 26) remarks that "the linga of Siva was venerated mainly in the south though a number of early lingas can also be traced in Northern India but none so far to the west as the above-mentioned unique terracotta-relief." No doubt the terracotta from Raingamahal is very interesting but we have recently noticed another antiquity of this type from Western India. A huge ekamukh/liiga, probably from Kheda-Brahma, now transferred to Baroda from the Himatnagar Museum, "shows affinities with the Kusana art so far 10 In the words of Dr. V. S. Agrawala (The Gupta Vikaiaka Age, 1946, Lahore, pp. 448), "both lihga form and the anthropomorphic image of Siva existed in the Kusana period, but their combination as evolved in the ekamukhi and the caturmukhZ Sivalingas was a characteristic feature of the Gupta iconography". Cf. also The Classical Age, op. cit., pp. 433 ff.; The Age of Imperial Unity, 195 , Bombay, pp. 460-61. 1 In both the terracottas, the eye mark is vertical and not horizontal. 64</page><page sequence="5">the modelling of the face is concerned" (U. P. Shah, Yournal of Indian Museums, Bombay, IX, 1953, pp. 102-03, plate XVIII, figure 39). The discovery of this early sculpturel2 from Gujrat too is very interesting indeed. The above terracottas of the Bikaner Museum deserve to catch the rapt attention of the art critics and experts of ancient Indian sculpture and iconography. In fact they go a long way in bearing testimony to the highly developed aesthetic sense of the people and their sound knowledge of iconography details as early as the Gupta period. The archaeological Museums at Amber (Jaipur), Bharatpur, Kota, Jhalawara, Jodhpur, Ajmer and various ancient sites of Rajputana preserve for us a veritable feast of fine antiquities pertaining to the Sunga, the Kusana and the Gupta periods. Most of these sculptures and terracottas have not been studied by the Indian scholars and it is essential to present their critical account at an early date. That will enable us to form an idea of the contribution of Rajputana to ancient Indian iconography and sculpture. 3 As a matter of fact this part of the country has to play an important role in this direction too. Let us await the discovery of more material in this field and also the publication of critical notes of appreciation of the antiquities now preserved in the local museums and those lying in situ on the sites. 12 This sculpture has been carved out of a huge block of greenish blue schist. The terracotta-relief from Rafigamahal is another antiquity of this type from Western India. Future discoveries, by way of archae- ological excavations, may enable us to bring to light some material on this point. Cf. Prog. Report. Archz. Surv. W.
