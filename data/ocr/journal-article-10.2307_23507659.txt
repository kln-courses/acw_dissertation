<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Worship of the Golden Calf: A Literary Analysis of a Fable on Idolatry HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO Hebrew Union College — Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati The worship of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32 and the aftermath of that offense described in Chapters 33 and 34, presenting innumerable problems in terms of form and content, coherence and consistency, has been analyzed in terms of documentary sources on dubious grounds and with results reflecting little credit on the editor of this pasdche. This essay approaches the three chapters as one integral narrative and, employing the tools of literary criticism, discloses the episodic narrative technique of its construction and the string on which the episodic elements are strung together. The result is an exegesis, a minimalistic interpretation of an exemplary rhetorical achieve ment. The final part of this essay attempts a broader interpretation of the biblical rhetorician's object in terms of a philosophical fable addressing the offense of "idolatry" in the context of religious iconoplasm or iconoclasm. A. Introduction History is commonly understood as a narrative of events which have actually taken place. The stuff of history is facts; that is to say, events to which we may apply the attributes of existence or of reality. Fiction, by contrast, is a term for a narrative whose events are inventions, imagina tive fashionings. The events of fictional narrative are therefore denied the attributes of existence or reality. Fiction, indeed, is the most common antonym for fact. This is why religionists uphold the historicity of bibli cal narrative and generally bridle at the suggestion that such narrative may be Fiction. Interestingly enough, adversaries of such religionists who themselves regard biblical narrative as being fiction for the most part are prone to assume that the authors of those narratives regarded themselves as presenting fact, not fiction. A characteristic — perhaps a peculiar characteristic — of the modern mature (or adult) mind is its disposition to distinguish between the objec tive and the subjective, assigning the attribute of truth or reality to the former and denying it to the latter altogether or conceding to it a lesser degree of whatever it is we mean by the true or the real. Things are, or</page><page sequence="2">HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [2] happen — objectively. The things which are or which happen are expe rienced — needless to say, subjectively. The experience of things or hap penings external to us is somehow a warrant of their existence, their reality, their truth. But purely internal experiences — say, of dreams or the wakeful imagination — independent of external reality, private not public, hence, publicly unverifiable, are not really real or really true or truly real. The Greek word onta, "the things which exist," has given rise to the philosophic category ontology, "the science of being or reality." Another Greek word, axios "worthy, valuable" has similarly eventuated in another category axiology, "the science of values." Whatever the defensibility of these two as separate and independent categories in technical philosophy, they are absurd in the world of normal everyday discourse. For the very words real and true are inescapably terms of value, i.e., human judgments on the worthiness of the things or occurrences which are supposedly the onta. Language, the medium for communication of human experience, reveals our essential incapacity to divorce our sense of what is from some attachment of value. Thus, for example, the word thing applies both to an object, a fact or artifact, on the one hand — all things which are; and, on the other, to an idea, a thought or a project — which may be or which may yet be, but is not yet, except in the mind. When a number of things are brought together in a span of time and related in some kind of activ ity we have a phenomenon for which a number of synonyms are availa ble: occurrence, incident, happening, event, episode. Synonyms, however, are almost never absolute, which is to say that they have not the same, but rather a similar, essential meaning. And in the case of our series of synonyms it is clear that what distinguishes them from one another is the degree of value, importance, or significance inhering in them. Closest to being neutral in value is occurrence, a something taking place, ÇTypographical error is a rare occurrence). Greater import attaches to incident.incident. An incident is an occurrence worthy of only brief remark, because its significance is slight in the larger context. A happening, until the last decade or so, was indistinguishable from an occurrence. Now it is used for a planned activity, one worth attending because it promises edi fication or delectation. How far it has been promoted from its older senses of happenstance or circumstance! It has indeed achieved the value of an event. The value inhering in this last word can be gauged by considering how even a minor event overshadows a major incident. The focus of our interest in this essay is the word episode. Like event it may be minor or major in context. A single act of adultery may be just an</page><page sequence="3">[3] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 3 episode in the life of a faithful spouse; one of many events in a war may turn out to have been the fateful episode. Such uses of episode illustrate the third meaning given this word in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: "A set of events that stand out or apart from others as of particular moment." What distinguishes this word from its synonyms is its origin in artistic context. It is a term borrowed from classical Greek drama where it is a label for the part of a tragedy between two choric songs. Episode, like chapter, is essentially a literary term, marking off a section of a narra tive. Hence the second definition: "A separate but not unrelated inci dent introduced in narration, for variety or artistic effect; also, a similar digression in a musical composition." The novel, normally, is featured by a plot, which is developed in sue ceeding chapters. In a melodramatic novel, plot is central and character ization minimal. In a psychological novel, plot is subservient to charac terization. A philosophical novel may advance (or deny) an underlying thesis, such as: character is fate. The modern short story, by contrast, may dispense with plot altogether; it may constitute an isolated episode, altogether without incident, evocative merely of a mood or a change of mood. Time-flow, the sequence of events, is the hallmark of the early novel. In the modern short story time-flow may, even when events are featured, be of little or no importance. And with the increasing incorpo ration of short-story techniques in novel-writing, time-flow may be delib erately blurred, distorted or involuted — even as, in William Faulkner's As As I Lay Dying, the narrator (not, be it noted, the author!) changes identities, flitting or shading like a dybbuk from one host-mind to another. The foregoing is by way of introduction to the interpretation of a eel ebrated narrative in the Book of Exodus, the worship of the Golden Calf and its aftermath. Even in the most accurate and felicitous of transla tions the narrative seems to make little sense, both as to form and con tent. In terms of content, supposedly responsible adults behave like idi ots; one hero is cast as villainous and escapes scot-free, other villains are exterminated only to leave associate criminals in the dock; these surviv ing accused are alternately punished, acquitted, punished again, and again acquitted. In terms of form, time-flow is involuted — at best; dia logues are repetitious and contradictory; and a drama — which for all its confusion reaches peaks of power — is interrupted by a self contradictory notice of cult-procedure and dribbles off into a finale which is a masterpiece of non-sequitur. Little wonder then that modern scholars have discerned the hands of</page><page sequence="4">4 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [4] two or three different authors, fragments of whose creativity have been pieced together by an editor determined on leaving to posterity a single whole, constructed out of the pieces remaining from different jig-saw puzzles.1 It is our contention in this essay that chapters 32-34 of Exodus make up a carefully crafted narrative in the service of a single theme, that every discrepancy is deliberate, that a single author made use of an epi sodic narrative technique to weave a tapestry-like presentation of a theo logical principle. And in the process of our interpretation there will be exposed a deployment of sophisticated literary devices which will seem to have resurfaced in modern literary art after floating, barely sub merged and unrecognized, for some two millennia and a half. B. Exegesis Part One: The Golden Calf Chapter 32 Episode Episode A 1) When the people realized how long overdue Moses was in coming down from the mountain, the people ganged up on Aaron. They said to him, "Come, make us a god, one which will go ahead of us. For that Moses — the Man who led us up from the land of (1) One of the less ponderous treatments of this narrative, applying the literary historical method of Wellhausen, is S.R. Driver's in The Book of Exodus, Cambridge. While it is not our object to mount a full-scale attack on the Documentary Hypothesis nor on any of the schools it has spawned (such as "tradition history"), we must confess that our approach bespeaks a judgment of failure on a once noble and daring enterprise. It is not merely that the literary-historical approaches have ended in a cul-de-sac (and have lured their Scandi navian opponents into blind alleys of their own). The fixing of initials on corpora or strands of isolated pentateuchal or hexateuchal narrative material, the marrying of these J, JE, P and D strings of narrational beads to halakhic (legal or cultic prescriptive) "codes," and the chaining of these strands to one or another relative chronology or geographic pro venience — all this has served to discourage a holistic approach to Scripture as a whole, or to such sections of it as have come down to us as integral (in some significant sense) units, such as tetrateuch or pentateuch. ... In this present study, we clearly have a narrative — incorporating halakhic elements — set within a cultic halakhic framework (the divinely ordained tabernacle), which cultic framework succeeds the moral or theological frame work of the Decalogue whose First and Second Commandments provide the key to the interpretation of the narrative. Assuming one authorship or provenience for the halakhic material and another for the narrative core, we should be confronted with choosing between two conclusions. The farrago makes little sense, in which case the editor was a monument of incompetence; or, the medley is a subtly successful blend, in which case the editor was a literary genius. And if the latter, why not credit him with authorship for the entirety — much as Shakespeare is accounted the author of The Tragedy of Julius Caesar despite his debt to Plutarch?</page><page sequence="5">[5] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF Egypt — we know not what has become of him." 2) Aaron said to them, "Snap off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me." 3) All the people snapped off the gold rings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron. 4) He took [this] from them and engraved it with a stylus. Thus he made it into a casting of a bull. They then exclaimed, "This now is your God, O Israel, which led you up from the land of Egypt." 5) When Aaron saw — he set up an altar before it. Aaron proclaimed, "Tomorrow — a feast to YHWH!" 6) Promptly on the morrow they offered up burnt offerings, près ented sacrifices of well-being. They sat down to dine and wine; then they arose to make merry. The Bible everywhere and tirelessly proscribes idolatry. Just what did the biblical writers understand by this term? A thoroughgoing address to this question must wait upon our analysis of this narrative in all its tortu ous complexities. For the present let us note that the people's demand of Aaron is that he make them an indeterminate "god" (Hebrew 0elohim), the necessity of which is somehow associated with the disappearance of Moses, the man. We have capitalized this last word in our translation to convey the force of the Hebrew word °ish. Here, as in other contexts, it distinguishes not as between male and female or the one against the many, but rather illustrious or paramount status. The function of this manufactured "god" is clear: to go in the lead of the Israelite host. But its form is unspecified. Neither the people who make the requisition nor Aaron who complies seem to have any idea — if they did, we are not told — of the shape which this god is to take. And the silence of the text on this point is only less baffling than the silence of Aaron on receiving the request. He makes no attempt to dissuade or remonstrate. He does not appear to remember, he certainly does not remind his petitioners or challengers, that the second command of the Decalogue proscribes the making of images, be they cast or sculpted, for use in worship. A single hint of reproof may be present in the repeated notice that the gold for the idol is to come from rings which adorn not the fingers, wrists, necks or noses, but the ears — the oft-attested symbol for obedience. The production of the god is shrouded in mystery. The account of its making is — in six words in the Hebrew — both specific and elliptical. Literally rendered, verse 4 reads, "He took from their hand, engraved it with a stylus and made it a cast bull."2 What is the "it" which he took and (2) Our translation "engraved it with a stylus" for wayyâçar *ôtô baheret is closest to AV's "fashioned it with a graving tool." The engraving tool heret is attested in Isaiah 8:1 with the</page><page sequence="6">6 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [6] engraved? Clearly, the gold, but not in the original form of earrings. We are left to infer that the rings have been melted down into a single ingot. What did Aaron engrave on the gold ingot? A word? A phrase? An image? We are not told. And what was the point of any engraving, if the ingot was then to be melted down and poured into the mold of a bull? The response of the people to the completion of the bull is perplexing on two counts. One, are we really asked to believe that mature adults would hail as their liberator from Egypt a man-made image which had not come into existence until that very moment? Two, would they have greeted the newly-produced artifact with such confidence in its authen ticity if Aaron had poured the molten gold into the mold, say, of an ass or an ape? Aaron's reaction is equally problematic. He proclaims the appearance of the bull as an occasion for a festival to YHWH, the invisi ble God of Israel, and this — "when he saw. . . ." Saw what? The flawlessness of the cast-image whose mold he had himself designed? Episode Episode B ך(ך) YHWH addressed Moses, "Leave! Go down! How corrupt the behavior of this people of yours whom you led up from the land of Egypt! 8) They have lost no time in departing from the path I charged them with. They have made themselves a cast bull, payed it worship, offered sacrifices to it, proclaiming, 'This is your god, O Israel, who led you up from the land of Egypt!'" This two-verse episode is limited to YHWH's address to Moses. Like the people in Episode A who first identified Moses as the man who led them up from Egypt — and then credited with the very same role the hitherto nonexistent bull image — YHWH assigns the historic role of leadership to Moses, and then cites the credit for that role which the idolaters assign to the bull. Unlike Aaron, He censures the manufacture of the bull as contrary to a prohibition which He has made explicit to Israel. As in Epi verb ktb "to write." The verb ysr "to fashion, shape," inappropriate with an etching instrument, would be vocalized as wayyiser; hence our rendering the verb along the sense of Akkadian esêru "to draw, make a mark." Such translations as "cast the metal in a mold" (NEB), "in a mould, melted the metal down" (Jerusalem Bible), "cast in a mould" (NJPS), represent total departures from the Hebrew text. Of interest, however, is the note in NJPS of a suggested rendering "tied it in a bag." This last would assume the verb srr "to tie up" with the identical vocalization as here in II Kings 5:23 with a noun hârit meaning "bag, purse" (also in Isa. 3:22). A play on two multivalent roots, one for verb and one for noun, would not be beyond the sophistication of our author who — as we shall show — has an artistic purpose, to keep us in the dark at this point of the narrative as to what Aaron did do. An analogous word-play is featured at least three times in Ps. 2: nôsdû &lt; swd/ysd; nâsakhtï &lt; verb "to pour" and noun "chieftain"; t'rôcem &lt; rch/ rcc.</page><page sequence="7">[7] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF sode A, there is no condemnation of Aaron for his central role in the incident. Not only this, Aaron's role is totally ignored. Here it is not Aaron, but the people who have made themselves a cast bull. And whereas Aaron in Episode A proclaimed that the building of the altar before the bull was for the purpose of celebrating a feast to YHWH, and the sacrifices offered upon it are not characterized in that Episode as offerings to the idol, YHWH declares that it is the idol which is wor shiped and that it is to the idol that sacrifices are made. The points of agreement in the two episodes, it goes without saying, require no comment. Congruity is what we expect of an author. What about the discrepancies? Unless we are to challenge the author's competence, we must credit these too to his intention, and search out what lies behind that intention. At this point in the narrative the inten tion lies close to the surface. In Episode A, the facts speak for themselves and a judgmental note — if it is present at all — is subtly placed in the mouth of Aaron. He says and does what he says and does, as do the peo pie. In Episode B, we are given YHWH's interpretation of the acts and His judgment upon them. The act is perverse and in direct contraven tion of YHWH's earlier command. The responsibility for the act is charged to the people who commissioned it and not to the agent who effected it. The discrepancies between Episode B which is a monologue and Episode C, a dialogue, are more troublesome. So troublesome, indeed, that modern scholarship has assigned it to a second author. Episode Episode C 9) YHWH said to Moses, "I have reached a conclusion about that people. It is a people incorrigibly stiff-necked. 10) Now, then, stand aside, so that My anger may blaze against them and I annihi late them. But I will make of you a great nation." 11) Moses implored his God, YHWH, "How, O YHWH, can You let Your anger blaze against Your people — whom You delivered from the land of Egypt with such great force and mighty hand! 12) How let the Egyptians say, 'With malevolence did He deliver them — to kill them off in the mountains, to annihilate them from the face of the earth!' Turn away from Your blazing anger, relent of this disas trous purpose against Your people. 13) Remember for the sake of Your servants, Abraham, Isaac and Israel, how You swore to them by Your Self, promising them, 'I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and all this land which I have des ignated will I give to your offspring to possess forever.'" 14) And</page><page sequence="8">8 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [8] YHWH did relent of the disastrous purpose he had proposed to wreak upon His people. The discrepancy between this episode and the preceding one is blatant. In Episode B, YHWH's characterization of the Israelite offense is a pro nouncement of His displeasure. But for all this note of judgment, there is no pronouncement of sentence. To the contrary, the bottom line of this episode appears in the first two words of YHWH's command to Moses. "Go down" — to your people at the base of the mount — implies that some remedial action may yet be taken. In clear contradiction to this is YHWH's opening of Episode C with His regretful conclusion that the people is "stiff-necked" — obstinate, incorrigible — and that His only recourse is to write finis to its career and to make a fresh start with Moses and his descendants. Moses' reply to this proposal elicits no speech from YHWH. Instead, we are given the bottom line of this episode, YHWH's renunciation of His proposal, which is altogether congruent with the bottom line of Episode B. What we have before us here, then, is another example of a narrative technique we have discerned in other biblical sto ries.3 A single incident is told in two episodic versions. The first episode (Episode B) is brief and synoptic. It relates the circumstance and the denouement. The second episode is resumptive and expansive; it dou bles back, so to speak, on its tracks — goes back in time — and tells how the bottom line was arrived at. Another feature of biblical narrative technique is to be noted in YHWH's address to Moses: free direct discourse.4 Words which are (3) This synoptic-expansive narrative technique is ubiquitous in Scripture. We shall therefore cite a few widely separated examples. In Genesis 15, the first six verses constitute the synoptic episode, the rest of the chapter the expansive episode. Both episodes consti tute one unit composed by a single author. In Jonah 3, verse 5 is the synopsis, while vv. 6-9 constitute the resumptive-expansive episode of Nineveh's repentance in response to Jonah's preaching. In Chapter 4 of that Book, vv. 1-4 is the synoptic unit, vv. 5-11 the expansive unit. Strikingly parallel to features in this chapter are those in I Kings 1g, vv. g-13a, 13b-18. One last example: In Jeremiah 26, vv. 7-16 tell of Jeremiah's indictment for treason, his self-defense and the verdict exonerating him; vv. 17-19 present a precedent citing argument for exoneration, vv. 20-23 present a precedent-citing argument for condemnation, while v. 24 singles out the chief of Jeremiah's champions in bringing about the verdict reported in v. 16. (4) Free direct discourse is sometimes elliptical, sometimes supererogatory, sometimes both. It is most commonly to be remarked in the oath formula introduced by the "if' particle Cim) in the protasis, followed by the kô ya^'së ("may He do such-and-such") of the apodosis, which is clearly elliptical in content though, not in form. On the other hand, the introduction of the oath formula by hay YHWH — an indicator of direct discourse — is often followed by ki, introducing a clause in indirect discourse. The various effects achievable by this device merit an independent study in rhetoric. In</page><page sequence="9">[g] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 9 explicitly marked off as a quote, as a direct address, may represent what the speaker intended rather than what he actually said. This technique allows the author to intrude himself in the dialogue — and thereby sub tly and ever so concisely to alert the reader to a key-element in the story. The words we translated "stand aside," more literally, "let me be," are pregnant with meaning. God does not require the permission of His ser vant to work His will. These words anticipate, and alert the reader to, a critical aspect of the prophet's role. Even as the prophet represents God to man, so must he represent man to God. God tells His servant what it is that his people deserves, so that His servant may fulfill his role as inter cessor. This Moses does, convincing God — as it were — with a three point argument. The qualification "as it were" is to remind ourselves that the entire story is told to us, not to God; that it is not God who needs convincing but we to whom the message is addressed; and that message is the core of Scripture's teaching: God's relationship to humanity is one of benevolence. He is present in history, acts with force in the interest of human freedom. And this out of His grace, for man rarely uses his free dom to earn God's beneficence. The first point in Moses' argument, therefore, is that God has already invested considerable energy in liberating the Israelites from Egyptian subjugation. What a waste of His effort if it is now to come to nothing. The second point is that the demonstration of God's benevolence to the Egyptians Egyptians will be undone, for they will not interpret the doom of the Israelites as a consequence of their disobedience in the wilderness; their very liberation from Egypt will be read as a sign of Deity's malevolence. And the third point is not that God's promise to the patriarchs would be broken by the punishment He proposes, for Moses too is their descend ant. The promise to the patriarchs is a subtle reminder that the libera tion itself is owing to the merit of the ancestors and not of the slave generation in Egypt. That same ancestral merit is now invoked on behalf of the generation which has again demonstrated its unworthiness. Episode Episode D 15) Moses turned and went down from the mountain, in his hand the two tablets of the Covenant stipulations, tablets inscribed on both their surfaces, yes, inscribed on one side and the other. — 16) The tablets themselves were of God's making, the handwriting our own Western literary tradition, free direct discourse would seem to be rare. Yet, in its elliptical feature it often appears in novels (not plays) where a page or two of dialogue will be characterized as the substance of an hour-long conversation.</page><page sequence="10">HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [10] lO of God incised upon the tablets. — 17) When Joshua heard the sounds of the people's noisemaking, he said to Moses, "There's a sound of battle in the camp!" 18) He replied, "It is not the sound of the victor's cry, nor the sound of the vanquished. The sound I hear I cannot make out."5 19) When he came close to the camp, made out the bull and the dancing, Moses' anger flared up. He flung the tablets from his hands, shattering them there at the base of the mountain. 20) He seized the bull they had made, consigned it to fire, then ground it to powder, sprinkling this on some water which he forced the Israelites to drink. In Chapter 24 of Exodus, of which our narrative is a continuation, we are informed (in episodic narrative form) that Moses had transmitted the decalogue and supplementary divine commands to the Israelites orally. The people accept these unanimously and a formal covenant cer emony between Israel and God ensues. When Moses reascends the mountain peak to receive the stone tablets, the divinely fashioned sym bol of the covenant, he is accompanied by his attendant Joshua, who is left behind at some distance from the peak. Episode D, harking back to Chapter 24, has Moses, upon the conclu sion of his audience with God, rejoining Joshua to descend with him to the camp. The episodic technique makes it possible for the author to proceed with the story line from Episode A, as if Episodes B and C had not intervened.6 The lessons of these two episodes — in regard to the attributes of God, Moses and the people — have been impressed upon us by the author's rhetorical skill. The story line can continue now in a (5) The paraphrase of qôl ""not is unavoidable. "The sound I hear is indeterminate" would also be periphrastic, and wooden — at that. The verb cânà, often incorrectly rend ered as "answer, reply" when no question has been put, means simply "to make a sound, utter, speak up, break into song, etc." The Hebrew here achieves its effect by contrasting the unmodified qôl c"nr&gt;t which Moses admits to hearing with the qôl c"nôt "given off in strength or given off in weakness" which Moses would have so identified had he heard such. (6) This is to say that as far as plot is concerned, Episode D follows Episode A and the reader would miss nothing in the storyline if B and C were omitted. These two episodes are, however, crucial to the development of the theme of the narrative — indeed, provide an adumbration and synopsis of the interchanges to come between an exacting YHWH and a pleading Moses. . . . Commentators have, to be sure, noted that the flaring up of Moses' anger upon his beholding the scene of revelry around the idol is somewhat incon sistent with an earlier disclosure (v. 8) to him of exactly what sinful doings would greet him at the base of the mountain. . . Overinterpretation is a sin for exegetes, not for interpreters, emboldening us to speculate: For the one who descends from the mountain peak, will not the vision of those who remained below be — inevitably — idolatrous? The supererogatory "at the base of the mountain" in v. 1g points, as we shall argue, to some such emphasis on the gap between leader and people.</page><page sequence="11">[11] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 11 more naturalistic vein, as though Moses makes his descent without any foreknowledge of what has been going on down there. ("Meanwhile, back at the ranch. . . .") The first awareness that something unusual is taking place in the camp is Joshua's dim reception of the riotous revelry emanating from it. Like the first sounds from a spectator-packed stadium, the trumpeting of voices and instruments may be witness of athletes vying in sport or of gladiators dueling to the death. Joshua's first guess is the latter. Moses says no — the sounds may be ambiguous, but they are not those of war. At first sight of the idol and the dancing about it, Moses reacts with anger and despair. The anger is proportional to the shock of first discovery, and directed against the revelers. The tablets, the handiwork of God Himself, their words readable from any direction and their truth guaranteed by God's own script, symbol of sovereign YHWH's gracious pact with His servant people, are flung from Moses' hands in despair. "At the base of the mountain." Where else? Not geography is intended here, rather moral responsibility. Israel has shattered the covenant so newly entered with unanimous acclaim. Verse 20 concludes the episode with a synoptic summation of what Moses went on to do. He reduces the bull to formless gold, pulverizes that into gold dust, and adding it to water — administers the potion to the people. Why? To what end? The answer must lie in the resumptive-expansive episodes which follow. Episode Episode E 21) Moses said to Aaron, "What was it that this people did to you that you brought upon them so great an offense?" 22) Aaron said, "Let my lord not be so intemperate in rage. You know this people from your own experience — that it is determined on evil-doing. 23) They said to me, 'Make us a god, one which will go ahead of us. For that Moses — the Man who led us up from the land of Egypt — we know not what has become of him.' 24) So I said to them, 'Any one having gold, snap it off.' They gave it to me, I flung it into the fire — and out came that bull." It is clear that Episode E opens at a point in time anterior to the destruc tion of the bull-image by Moses. In his answer to Moses' question Aar on's use of the pronominal adjective "this/that" is tantamount to his pointing a finger at it. (Normally the pronoun zeh is rendered as "this." When it is rendered as "that," it reflects a sense of scorn, the speaker distancing himself from the object, as in "that man in the White House.") Two features in Moses' question require comment. One is the phrase,</page><page sequence="12">12 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [12] literally rendered, "brought upon them so great an offense." It is good Hebrew but unfelicitous English. For in our English expression it is the perpetrator who brings the offense upon himself. The Hebrew idiom derives from a regular métonymie (part for the whole, cause for effect) use of the terms for crime, sin, and guilt to stand for their consequences; thus, respectively, punishment (for crime), expiation (for sin), indemnity (for guilt). The second feature is the implication that Aaron, in making the bull, was acting out of malice towards the people: He must have suf fered some great wrong at their hands to go along with their proposal, a proposal which he must have known would bring down upon them dire retribution. Such oblique expression — the attribution of hostility to a person who acts mistakenly, but with no malice prepense, is a common form of hyperbole in Scripture.7 Here, the hyperbole lies chiefly in the implication that Aaron complied with the people's request willingly, not out of compulsion. That this implication is hyperbolic is guaranteed by the absurdity of attributing malice against the people to Aaron, for had Aaron acted other than out of compulsion, he would have brought a full measure of punishment upon himself as well. Aaron's answer is directed to what both he and Moses know to be hyperbole, hyperbole expressing Moses' intemperate anger which rises out of the heat of provocation. Aaron first addresses Moses in the respectful third person, calling his brother "my lord," suggesting politely that he should cool down. He then switches to the intimacy of second person address, recalls to Moses his own experience with this people — it is hell-bent on self-destruction — perhaps hinting that Moses might not have handled the situation any better. He then quotes verbatim (from Episode A) the formulation of the people's request for a god to go in their lead, yes in the place of the leader Moses, whose failure to return in reasonable time suggests that this leader too must shoulder some small element of responsibility. But his description of his own response to the people's demand is even more terse and perplexing than the puzzling description of it by the narrator in Episode A. He does not plead in his own defense. He neglects to report the reproof to the people contained in his asking for the gold hanging from their ears. He does not mention his enigmatic inscription of the gold ingot. He does not recall that his proclamation of a celebration was to honor YHWH. He makes no men don — and this in keeping with the account in Episode A — of the mak ing of a mold into which the gold was to be formed. No, he says that he (7) For other and analogous examples of obliqueness in biblical narrative, cf.

The response to this incredible tale is silence. Silence gives consent. Moses accepts the story. And we have no choice but to accept it also. That is to say, accept the story as factual. There is complete congruence as between Episode A and Episode E. And this congruence resolves a problem which has baf fled generations of exegetes, orthodox religionists and scientific mod ernists alike.How account for the central role of Aaron in the sinful pro duction of the bull-idol? The Aaron who is to be chosen by YHWH as the first high-priest of Israel and the founder of the dynastic priestly line which is to monopolize the sacerdotal office for as long as Jerusalem's sacred Temple endures? (And, let us remember, this narrative is the fill ing of a sandwich. It lies between God's instructions and the execution of His instructions concerning the making of the Tabernacle and the ordi nation of Aaron and his sons to its priesthood.) The logic of Aaron's role in history, and the logic of this narrative's placement within the account of how he attained that role, require that Aaron emerge from this narra five as its hero, at best, or blameless, at the least. And it is as such that the narrator contrives to present him. The very artfulness of a literary creation often results in the subver sion of its message. Thus, for example, the endurance of Gulliver's Trav els els as an adventurous fantasy for children. Or the attacks on its author for suggesting in A Modest Proposal that the English would both benefit the economy of Ireland and enhance the succulence of their own diet by substituting the flesh of Irish babes for suckling pig; attacks, be it remembered, in his own lifetime, on the leading Irish clergyman of his generation. In the case of the biblical narrative before us, it has been the determined insistence on ascribing literal-mindedness to its author which has blinded us to his artful intent. The puzzling questions raised by the formulations in Episode A receive their resolution in Episode E. And how much greater the impact on the reader than if his attention had not been piqued in the first episode, or had been piqued only to be immediately rewarded. Now we know why the people were so confident of the bull-image's authenticity as a representation of the God who had delivered them from Egypt. Now we can guess what Aaron may have incised on the ingot: "To YHWH" — or something along that line.8 Now we know what it was that (8) Or, if he made no incision in the gold ingot to which the rings had been reduced,</page><page sequence="14">14 HERBERT CHANAN BR1CHTO [ 14] "Aaron saw" of a sudden, and which prompted him to proclaim a festival to YHWH. He flung an ingot into the fire, he waited confidently for its reduction to a liquid blob, ready to turn on the image-demanding insti gators with this proof of their folly. Instead, a miracle occurred. A mira cle which could have been worked only by the will of YHWH! This last conclusion — so absurd to our mentality — has been a contributing factor to our perception of the story as an enigma. But it would pose neither absurdity nor enigma to the biblical mind. Examples abound in Scripture of what has been labeled the opus alienum, the ascription to the working of YHWH of a strange event, an event by défini tion contrary to His will, an event which alienates from Him the obedi ence of His creatures. A single example, chosen for its context of prophecy, will suffice.9 In Deuteronomy 13, Moses is addressing Israel: 2) Should there arise among you a prophet or one who receives dream-oracles who presents you with a portentous sign, 3) even if that portentous sign comes to pass — which he predicted in [sup port of] a proposal to the effect, "Let us follow other gods" — gods of whom you have had no experience — "and pay them homage" — 4) pay no heed to the proposal of that prophet or dream-oracle recipient. It is only your God, YHWH, putting you to the test, to ascertain whether you are indeed loyal to YHWH, your God, heart and soul. 5) It is only YHWH, your God, you are to follow, Him alone you are to revere, His call alone to obey, to Him alone be steadfast in homage. 6) As for that prophet or dream-oracle receiver, he is to be put to death. . . The purport of this passage could hardly be clearer. YHWH is the ulti mate author of all truth and reality, of all events and experience. When any call to action proclaimed in the name of Deity is by its nature contra dictory to the expressed will of YHWH, such as a call to apostasy, its her aid must be put to death for his treason. Even if Heaven itself seems to support his call by providing a predicted miracle. As for the obvious questions, "How can Deity collaborate with the false prophet, how per mit the miraculous event to take place? — the answer is, or should be, equally obvious. Miracles cannot override faith. YHWH, indeed, deploys miracles to put our faith to the test. . . In the case of the Golden Calf, the rather bound the rings in a sack (cf. Note 2, above), we now realize what he did with the sack of earrings. (9) For other and analogous examples of the opus alienum, cf. HUCA 39 (1968) pp. 40-43, and note 9 there, in particular.</page><page sequence="15">[15] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF people who asked for "a god to lead them" had already failed the test. Aaron had relied on natural law to expose their faithlessness as absurd. And YHWH went one step further. He suspended natural law, per formed a miracle to demonstrate the dire consequences of faithlessness, to demonstrate that faithlessness to His will is unreasonable even when reason itself is called into question by the occurrence of a miracle. Episode Episode F 25) Moses saw that the people was deranged, deranged by Aar on's act to the point of helplessness against any who would stand up against them.10 26) Moses took his stand in the gateway of the encampment and proclaimed, "Whoever is for YHWH, come to my side!" The Levites in full number rallied to his side. 27) To them he said, "Thus commands YHWH, the God of Israel: 'Belt on, every one, sword on thigh. Cross the camp back and forth from gateway to gateway. And kill, each one of you, your fellow — be he friend or kinsman." 28) The Levites went into action, obedient to Moses' charge. There fell of the people that day some three thousand men. 29) [In his charge to the Levites] Moses said, "Dedicate your hands to YHWH — for it is each of you against son and brother — that He may grant you immunity on this fateful day. Episode F features the retribution for the sin of idolatry. Episode E, as we have seen, is the expansion of the interval between Moses' despairing anger at first sight of the bull and his disposition of that golden mon strosity in verse 20, the last notice in Episode D. Thus Episode F begins with Moses' evaluation of the condition of "the people." This word, people, is ambiguous; it can stand for the entire folk, or for a council representing the folk, or for any group of leaders or faction arrogating to itself the authority of such a council. In our narrative, the intent is unquestionably the last category, i.e., the instigators or the ringleaders. When Moses issues the call for volunteers to stand up for YHWH it is only the Levites who respond. The Levites, a tribal caste from among whom the family of our hero, Aaron, is to emerge with a monopoly of the Temple priesthood. The other Levitical families are also destined for (îo) Our translation of this verse is conjectural, as are the various standard renderings. The problems, inhering in the rare root sms and the ambiguous connotation of prc, may reflect a double entendre along the lines suggested in note 2, above. The condition of the perpetrators of the offense could have left them vulnerable to attack, as in our rendering, or as in NJPS "out of control ... so that they were a menace to any who might oppose them."</page><page sequence="16">16 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [16] hierarchical privilege; they are destined to assist the Aaronides in their cult service; one of their chief functions will be to stand armed guard over the Temple's sacred property: its housing, furniture and appurte nances. As Aaron's loyalty to YHWH, expressed in his attempt to thwart the idolaters, earns for his descendants the prerogatives of priesthood, so the Levitical minutemen earn for their descendants a sacred role sec ond only to that of their Aaronide kinsmen. Two items call for comment. The first is the three thousand ringlead ers who fall to the Levitical swordsmen. Who were they? Or to put the question more precisely, how did the Levites know whom to single out for execution? The clue to the answer lies in Chapter 5 of the Book of Numbers. There God ordains for the administration of a potion to be administered by the priest to a woman charged with adultery. The effects of the potions are oracular, they point to the woman's guilt or innocence. If guilty, she suffers a serious and undisguiseable affliction; if innocent, she is immune — suffering no effects from the potion. . . ." Now the meaning of Moses' action in verse 20 becomes clear. He reduced the golden bull to a lump, pulverized it, sprinkled the dust upon water, and administered the potion to "all the Israelites."12 The presumption is clear that only the ringleaders were affected by the drink. We are left to guess the specific effect on the guilty — yellow jaundice, perhaps? — but their guilt was in some way made clear. And, weakened by the ingestion of the golden god whose making they had instigated, they fell easy prey to YHWH's servants. The second item requiring comment is verse 29. All the standard translations render Moses' reason for calling on the Levites to dedicate themselves to YHWH as describing an action in the past tense. Thus, for example, "for each of you has been against son and brother" (JPS, New (11) Cf. Brichto, "The Case of the Sôtà," HUCA 46 (1975). (12) The differences between the account here and Moses' description of the events in Deut. 9:8-21 are not to be seen as discrepancies. The writer of these words certainly knew the account in Exodus. Thus, for example, Moses' administration of the potion to all of the Israelites is not to be taken literally. The author did not need such experience as we have had in the case of the Rev. Jim Jones on Guiana to realize the logistical problem of force feeding an entire community. Moses' version in Deuteronomy — that he threw the dust into the brook coming down the mountain-side — would seem to be a more literal descrip tion of his action: he contaminated the common water supply. Here, too, however, the symbolic overrides the literal, for the fine gold dust would have been swept downstream long before an atom of it could have been guaranteed lodging in the innards of every single Israelite. . . Note also that the second period of forty days on the mountain is in Deuteronomy the length of time required by Moses to win God over to sparing Israel, whereas in the Exodus account both the sparing of Israel and YHWH's agreement to accompany them is achieved in a few brief passages of dialogue.</page><page sequence="17">[ 17] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 1 ך Translation)•,Translation)•, "because you have turned each against his own son and brother" (Oxford, New English Bible). This, despite the fact that the Hebrew has no verb at all. Hebrew idiom regularly expresses the present-future of the verb "to be" by omitting it altogether. Thus, our translation is the only one faithful to the Hebrew original. The context for the statement, too, confirms this. For the Hebrew words "fill the hand," an idiom for "dedicate, ordain," makes sense in this context only before the Levites launch themselves on their bloody mission. The bracketed words in our translation solve the problem which has caused translators to distort the original Hebrew. The bottom line of this Epi sode is verse 28, the execution of the instigators. Verse 29, in the synoptic-resumptive technique with which we have now become familiar, fills in a detail of Moses' charge to the Levites. Had the execu tioners acted on their own recognizance, they would have been guilty not just of murder, but of fratricide, a crime calling for capital punishment, to be exacted by the victims' next-of-kin. In dedicating their hands to YHWH, making themselves the instruments of YHWH, the Levites are guaranteed YHWH's favor and protection. Both these words are cov ered by the Hebrew word for "blessing." The sense of "favor" is surely there, pointing to the preferred position which the Levites will be accorded in YHWH's Temple service. But "protection" — immunity from the retribution of blood vengeance — is the immediate focus of Moses' intent.13 Episode Episode G 30) On the morrow, Moses addressed the people: "You now, have been guilty of a great sin. I, then, will go up to YHWH — per haps I may yet propitiate for this sin of yours." 31) Thus it was that Moses went back to YHWH. He said, "By Your leave! This people is guilty of committing a great sin — making themselves a god of gold. 32) Now then, if you will forbear in regard to this sin of theirs — But if not, erase me from the program You have written!" 33) YHWH said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against Me, him only (13) The term brk "bless," as an antonym of terms connoting disaster, threat, danger and hence protection or immunity from such, is clear in such contexts as Deut. 29:18 (cf. NJPS) and Judges 17:2. Contexts parallel to our text are Genesis 15:1 where Rashi associ ates God's promise to shield Abram with the possibility of vengeance for the deaths he inflicted in the war described in the previous chapter, and Numbers 25:10-13 where Phineas is promised God's friendship for his act of zealousness which exposed him to vengeance on the part of his victim's kin. In both cases, as here in Exodus 32, the promise is protection from harm in the near future and reward extending to the protagonist's poster ity.</page><page sequence="18">18 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [18] will I erase from my program. 34) Now then, go! Lead the people to the destination which I have told you about — lo, my angel shall go ahead of you — but at that time when I call for an accounting, I shall call them to account for this sin of theirs." 35) [A time did come when] YHWH afflicted the people for making the bull, (the bull) which Aaron produced. In our discussion of Episode F we anticipated, when we referred to the victims of the Levitical swordsmen as the ringleaders or instigators, this Episode G. For only now does it become clear that there were two classes of offenders constituting "the people." Those executed by the Levites were responsible for the commission of the sin. The rest — save Aaron and the Levites — were guilty of an act of omission. Their non-resistance to the offense rendered them, so to speak, accessories to the fact. As in Episode B where God attributes the making of the bull to the whole people, indicating thereby that He holds them all responsible, so here Moses charges the people with their responsibility for the event. And in confessing their guilt to God he uses the same terms which God used, "making themselves a god of gold." He then harks back to the theme of Episode C, the role of the prophet as intercessor for his sinful people. Indeed he takes up YHWH's threat in Episode C to annihilate the peo pie and make a fresh start with Moses, as though he had not, in that episode, won a reprieve for his people. But in this episode, he does not argue with YHWH to persuade him that He should relent. He merely affirms his solidarity with his sinful people. His tone in pleading with YHWH is respectful, even abject, but it is firm nonetheless: It is all of us or none of us. If you forbear, well and good. If not, count me out; I shall share my people's fate. The Hebrew term for Moses' plea is "bear the offense," everywhere rendered "forgive their sin." Hebrew has other terms for forgiveness or pardon. This term, however, does not mean to forgive or to pardon, i.e. to wipe the slate clean. It means to withhold punishment, to carry the debit on the books, to refrain from foreclosing. Moses is only asking that his people be granted another chance. YHWH replies first in rejection, then in acceptance. He rejects Moses' formulation: go easy with them or count me out. YHWH's response that He will decide whom to count out is a rather gentle way of telling Moses not to present Him with ultima turns. He does, however, accept the substance of Moses' plea. His com mand of dismissal to Moses makes this explicit. Resume your role as Isra el's leader, resume the march towards the promised land. And then He reverts to His rejection of Moses' ultimatum. He reminds us that a</page><page sequence="19">[1g] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF lg reprieve has been asked and granted, but not absolution. When Israel sins yet again, He says, providing Him with cause to review the record, He will punish them for this offense as well. The concluding notice of this episode has baffled translators and commentators alike. It seems to conclude the episode with a contradic tion of the reprieve which YHWH has promised. But it only seems so if we forget that someone is telling a story. The narrator, at this point, returns (and jumps ahead in time, if you will) to the audience he is addressing. And tells them that at some later point in the ongoing narra tive of Israel's history, YHWH was as good as his word. He did — in some unspecified way — punish Israel for their part in the sin of the Golden Calf. At first blush, one might wonder why this notice was included at all. And why, in telling that the people were indeed punished, repeat the hyperbolic statement "for making the bull" and then almost pedantically underline the hyperbole by adding a reminder that they did not actually make the bull, it was the bull which Aaron had, so to speak, conjured up. The answer lies in the narrator's consciousness of his audience and their own immediate concerns. The audience are Israelites. They have been taught that God graciously credits ancestral merit to descendants in the thousandth generation; but also that He exacts payment for ancestral sins down to the fourth generation. In this concluding notice of the Golden Calf narrative, the narrator offers his audience a measure of reassurance. The offense of complicity in that early idolatry was expiated. The threat of punishment for that ancestral sin no longer hangs over them. If the generation listening to the story is ever to suffer for the sin of idolatry, it will be for an idolatry which is their own doing. Episode G, concluding the narrower event of the Golden Calf, winds up on a note of retribution. And, if our interpretation is valid, on a note of warning by the narrator to his audience. Our own exercise in literary criticism would be seriously deficient if we did not pause to review what our analysis has disclosed: a supreme achievement of narrative art. In one chapter, the biblical author has spun a tale of crime and punishment, sin, retribution and expiation. He has depicted the sin as springing from anxiety, the varying degrees of guilt in the participants — active and passive; the acts and the motives of the loyalists. He has maintained the suspense of the action throughout, never permitting his audience to forget that their own innocence or guilt, felicity or misfortune, are also at stake. He has unfolded the role of the prophet as the leader betrayed, angry judge, and self-sacrificial intercessor; the role of the priest, loyal to his God, temporising with his flock, appealing to</page><page sequence="20">20 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [20] reason, and subverted in his efforts by the very God whose command he is defending. He has developed the attributes of God, alternately gra cious in His dealings with an undeserving generation, fiercely exacting in sentence and execution, and again graciously relenting — to give human mortals another chance, and thereby protecting His own invest ment: the scenario He has authored for the creation he has staged and the actors He has chosen. All this the biblical author has achieved in seven episodes, packed into 35 verses; episodes intricately tied together by the use of varicolored threads, appearing and reappearing in sepa rate scenes on a two-dimensional tapestry. A tapestry which for all its flatness somehow succeeds in putting flesh on an incorporeal God, portraying man in three-dimensional corporeality, and somehow mapping the protagonists and the events in the elusive fourth dimension of time. Yet this perhaps unequalled achievement of art is wrought by an author content to remain anonymous, striving for neither pay nor applause, perhaps even contemptuous of esthetic values. He is a preacher with one aim in mind: the greater glory of his God. And the chapter we have just concluded is only the introduction of his theme, the proem to his message. Two more chapters remain to his composition, in which actions are minimal and dialogue almost interminable. He will continue to employ the episodic technique, but his material will not lend itself to the dramatic. With voices predominating over actions, a musical analogy will prove more appropriate to the narrative technique. The development of our author's theme will more resemble the fugual than the tapestry art. The link between these two sections of the narrative is present in verse 34. In bidding Moses to lead the Israelites towards their next destination, YHWH inserts a parenthetical remark: "My angel (or, mes senger) will go ahead of you." Part Two: The Aftermath Chapter 33 Episode Episode H 1) YHWH addressed Moses, "Move on, you and the people which you led up from Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, 'To your offspring will I give it.' — 2) I will send an angel to advance before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites —</page><page sequence="21">[2 1 ] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 2 1 3) a land oozing with milk and honey. That is [to say], I Myself will not travel in your company, lest — you being so stiffnecked a peo pie — I annihilate you in mid-course." 4) When the people heard this ominous word, they reacted with grief. No one donned any fin ery. 5) [This came about in this way:] YHWH said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites [in My name], 'So stiffnecked a people are you, at any moment — were I to travel in your company — I might annihilate you! For the present, then, doff all finery . . . while I consider how I am to deal with you.'" 6) So it was that the Israelites went stripped of their finery from Mount Horeb on. This episode resumes with God's bidding Moses, as in Episode G, to resume the trek towards the promised land. Again He treats Moses and his people as a single identity — "you and the people you led up from Egypt"Egypt" — and still addressing Moses, (in verse 3) treats him as standing for the entire people: "You are an incorrigible folk." In qualifying the promised land, as promised not to this generation but to the patriarchs, He harks back to Episode C where Moses raised the plea of ancestral merit, and thereby stresses that the permission to move on to their goal owes nothing to their own deserts. He again advises Moses (as in Episode G) that He will send His agent to go in the van, but this time the role of "the angel" is to clear the promised territory of the populations whom Israel must displace from the land. Yet another reminder that it is by YHWH's (undeserved) grace — surely not by dint of their own prowess — that the land will become theirs. And in connection with the dispatch of this powerful agent He underlines the double significance of this agent. YHWH in all His awesome power cannot permit Himelf to be part of their company. He is giving them another chance, but He is not sanguine about Israel's changing its nature so soon. By keeping a dis tance between them and Himself He will not be tempted, as it were, to fly off the handle and wreak the doom which they have just now so nar rowly escaped. The angel thus represents God's grace — His power is deployed on their behalf — and His lack of confidence that Israel will not again put that grace to the test. Verse 4 tells of the reaction of the people when they got word of God's intent. They react not to the fact of grace, but to — what? Chagrin that YHWH in all his dread power will not be present among them? Hardly likely! In Chapter 20, verses 18-2 1, we are told that Israel knew enough to fear His proximity. Witnessing the thunder and lightning bolts, the trumpeting sounds and the smoking peak of the mount —</page><page sequence="22">HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [22] 22 emblems of YHWH's presence — they kept their distance, proposed to Moses that he represent them in dialogue with Deity: "You speak to us — we shall obey — but let not God speak to us, lest we perish!" It would appear then that the grief can only be due to God's scolding of them, his expression of no confidence. But is that a reason for not wearing jew elry? And then — after their reaction — comes verse 5 with the appar ently repetitious characterization of their stiffneckedness and the com mand of God to doff the jewelry which we have just been told they had not put on in the first place! All this points again to the synoptic-resumptive narrative technique.14 Verse 4 gives the bottom line of the episode. Verses 5 and 6 go back in time, expand the synopsis, and telling how the bottom line was arrived at, also explain its meaning. The offense of complicity in idolatry is still on the books. Even a minor sin would bring the atomic pile of God's anger to a critical mass. That is why God must absent Himself. A pris oner in the dock does not dress as if for a festivity. God, in forbidding the wearing of finery, is employing a metaphor to remind Israel that it is still standing under judgment. And that judgment, we are told in verse 6, hung over Israel, like a Damoclean sword, from Horeb onwards. Until when? Until that unspecified time of punishment and expiation related in the last verse of Chapter 32, the bottom line of Episode G. Digression Digression A A 7) Now Moses would take a certain tent and pitch it for himself beyond the encampment's limits — a good distance beyond. It was called the Tent of Encounter. Anyone with a matter to lay before YHWH would go out to that Tent of Encounter, beyond the camp's limits. 8) When Moses, however, went out to the Tent of Encounter, the entire people would stand to attention, each at his own tent-opening, their attention fixed on Moses until he arrived at the Tent. 9) Once Moses arrived at the Tent,15 the Cloud Pillar would descend, stand stationary at the Tent's entrance, and [He] would speak with Moses. 10) The moment all the people saw the Cloud Pillar stationed at the Tent entrance, the people in its entirety dropped in obeisance, each at his own tent entrance. 11) YHWH would speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to (14) CF. page 8 and note 3. (15) Note "arrived at" and not, as NJPS "entered." The verb bo' often means "to enter" but that it does not do so here is guaranteed by the Cloud Pillar's station at the tent's entrance; otherwise we should have a picture of Moses within the tent, sharing its interior with young Joshua while the Deity, Whose symbolic residence the tent is, stands outside.</page><page sequence="23">[23] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 23 another. Then [the audience over], he would return to the camp — his aide Joshua bin-Nun, however, as duty-officer, would not stir from the Tent. We have labeled this passage a digression, a synonym for episode, and connoting "a deviation, often at the expense of unity of effect, from the main subject of a discourse" (Webster's Collegiate Dictionary). Both its con tent and context have perplexed scholars. Tent of Encounter is a name for the tabernacle which has yet to be built, the movable shrine whose design and furniture God was dictating to Moses on the mount until the moment of Israel's idolatry. Once this Tent of Encounter is constructed it will be pitched in an area considered outside the encampment proper, although ringed on all four sides by the twelve tribes. Can this passage, as some scholars insist, have reference to that yet-to-be constructed tab ernacle? Yes, but only if it is by the hand of another author, interpolated here by an editor. But why, assuming such a snippet of tradition existed and found its way to an editor, would that editor choose to insert it into the narrative at this point, interrupting the narrative's flow? The job of an editor, after all, is to improve an author's work, not to garble it. A number of considerations point to the conclusion that this passage, digression though it is, is an integral part of the story. And the Tent of Encounter here is not the ornate tabernacle which has yet — as the author well knows — to be constructed. What the narrator is telling us is that prior to Moses' receipt of the instructions for the tabernacle at Horeb and his execution of them, Moses had to improvise a place where God and man might meet (or rendezvous, the basic meaning of the word rendered Meeting or Encounter). Once God's instructions have been executed, the pitching and dismantling of the Tent of Encounter will be the business of the Levites, the role of intermediary will be filled by the ordained priests — Aaron and his sons. But up to that point, it was Moses who pitched the tent "for himself' and it was Moses' lieutenant, Joshua, who did service at the tent between Moses' comings and goings. Joshua was on duty at all times, ready to assist any Israelite who came with an appeal to YHWH. And at such times there was no visible man ifestation of YH WH's presence — any more than we witness today at any synagogue, church or mosque. Joshua served as a lay minister, so to speak, and the individual Israelite would, as we do today, answer for himself whether God had responded and how. In the case of Moses, we are told, when he came to the tent he did so as the representative of all Israel — as indicated by the formal stance of attention and homage which is assumed by the individual Israelites at their own tent-entrances.</page><page sequence="24">24 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [24] And at such times, YHWH's presence was manifested in the marvelous descent of the Cloud Pillar. And the response which Moses received from the Presence in the Cloud was not the kind of oracle normally received by ordinary people — vague, enigmatic, or ambiguous — it was as clear and direct as one receives from a fellow human, with whom one speaks "face to face." Why does the narrator introduce this digression here? For one thing, he must tell us where Moses received his direct communications from YHWH on other than those two or three rare occasions when he ascended Horeb-Sinai. Thus, for example in Episode G, when Moses "goes up" to intercede with YHWH, he does not again ascend the mount as he will do in an episode-to-come in order to receive a duplicate set of tablets. The narrator is stressing that whether on the mount or at the tent, God's presence was manifest for all to witness, and the message of God to Moses, as also Moses' retailing of that message to Israel, was clear — and not subject to doubt or question. For another, the digression deals with the issue which has just been raised in Episode H and which will be the focus of Episode I: the presence in Person of God amidst the Israelites, or His representation there by an agent, His "angel." We are informed in this digression that up till this moment in time, YHWH's Presence has not abided among them. He has appeared on the mountain-peak and, at its base or elsewhere, only at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, which was pitched, not among the Israelites, not even at their geographical center, but "outside the encampment — at a good distance."""' Episode Episode I 12) Moses said to YHWH, "Look now, You say to me, 'Lead this people onward,' but you have not let me know just who it is you are sending with me. You Who have said, 'I have singled you out by name, and you have, of a surety, gained My favor!' 13) Now then, if I have, indeed, gained Your favor, let me in on your Way that I may know You — that I may know that I continue in Your favor — and [I plead,] acknowledge that 'that' nation is Your people." (16) When the elaborate tabernacle (miskân) or Tent of Encounter is made it will be within the Israelite encampment in a positional sense, with three tribes encamped to the north, the south, the east, and the west. But in a constitutive sense, it will be "outside the encampment" in a sacred sense as the areas beyond the tribes will be "outside the encamp ment" in a profane sense. This allows for a play in the books of Leviticus and Numbers on the significance of YHWH's presence in Israel's midst in one sense and non-presence in its midst in another sense.</page><page sequence="25">[25] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 25 14) He responded, "Suppose I go Myself in the lead — will I satisfy you?" 15) He said to Him, "If You do not Yourself go in the lead, do not make us stir from here. 16) For how else, say, make it known that I have gained Your favor — yes, I and Your people — if not by Your accompanying us, revealing how distinguished we are — both I and Your people — from every other people of the earth?" We have seen that the concluding verse of Episode G refers to a point in time far ahead of the "present" time of the narrative's action. We saw further that the time-frame of Episode H is earlier than that of Episode G's concluding verse; namely that the latter has Israel standing under judgment, but not yet punished, while the former jumped ahead to report that at a certain time there was punishment and expiation. Simi larly now, we must realize that Episode I is unconcerned with the ques tion of Israel's punishment. Its concern is with the other end of the spec trum — the generous extent of God's grace in His dealings with Israel — symbolized in the issue of His Presence in Person among His people. It is Moses who now raises this issue, but in a circumspect way, not head on. In citing YHWH's command to lead the people forward, he harks back to Episode G (32:34) and Episode H (33:1). He then raises the question as to the identity of the "angel" whom God has indicated He will appoint to show the way to Moses (Episode G, 32:34), and to represent Him in the people's midst (Episode H, 33:2-3). He implies, further, that YHWH's failure to reveal to him the identity of the angel is somehow not in consonance with YHWH's declaration that he, Moses, has gained YHWH's favor. While we could wish for more information on the ancient Israelite's view of angelology, an examination of three passages will yield us part of that picture. In Genesis 32, Judges 6, and Judges 13 we have tales of mortals confronted by a mysterious stranger in human form who only at the tale's conclusion is clearly recognized by the mortals as a numen, a supernatural being, an agent or angel of God's. In all three cases, the moment of recognition is attended by an expression of awe, fear that one may yet die as a result of such contact with divinity, or wonder that one has indeed managed to survive such contact. In Genesis 32:30 and Judges 6:2 2 this expression of awe features exactly the same words: "I have seen divinity (a god or God, in Genesis; an angel of YHWH, in Judges) face to face." In Judges 13, where "face to face" does not appear, the idea is implicit in the words, "for we have seen divinity." The accounts in Gen esis 32 and Judges 13 have another feature in common: the mortal</page><page sequence="26">26 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [26] bluntly asks the numen to reveal his name, and the identical response — equivalent to, "Don't ask!" — implies that in asking the question the human is overstepping his bounds: "How is it that you venture to ask for my name!" (In Judges 13, the angel adds, "since it is Mysterious.") These accounts supply us with something of a context for Moses' com plaint (is there a note of petulance in it?) that YHWH has withheld the angel's name, and for the play on words in citing YHWH's singling out Moses for favor; the Hebrew idiom is, literally, "I have known you by name." They also supply a bridge between the notice in Digression A that YHWH spoke to Moses "face to face" and Moses' interest in the name of the angel YHWH proposes to send along with him, in Episode I.I. But the narrative pattern is different in this episode than in the other passages treating of angels. Moses does not ask for the name of the angel. He does not pause to give YHWH a chance to respond to the com plaint. He indicates that his complaint may be laid to rest in another way: You may demonstrate Your favor, he says, "that I may know You" — note, You, not Your angel — if You will "show me Your way."17 What is meant by this "way"? The answer becomes clear if we render this word by a synonym, "route," and read it in context. Moses is asking for a road map! He does not want the name of the angel, because he does not want the angel. The whole purpose of the angel is to serve as guide to Moses. Let us dispense with him altogether, says Moses. Give me a map of Your intentions, and I shall be guide enough. The general failure to discern this meaning of Moses' words is due to two factors. The first is the failure to credit the narrator with full capacity for artistic subtlety. YHWH is the ultimate monarch. And Moses, for all his stature, is His subject. It ill behooves the subject to reject outright a proposal by his Sovereign which is put forth to show him favor. He, therefore, expresses his wish in an oblique way. Or, to put it more honestly, slyly. The second factor is the failure to grasp YHWH's response, a response in which YHWH amusedly reveals that He, for His part, can dispense with Moses' beating about the bush. The response of YHWH is almost universally rendered as a declarative statement, along the lines of — to pick the best of translations: "I will go in the lead and give you rest" or "and lighten your burden."18 But the issue at hand is not rest nor easing of a burden. It is the putting to rest of Moses' complaint. And it is (17) The consonantal text indicates that "way" is singular while the vocalization treats the noun as plural, "ways." Either reading is in consonance with our interpretation. (18) For a fuller discussion of this verse, cf. HUCA 39 (1968), p. 46, n. 14.</page><page sequence="27">27 [27] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF regrettable that the absence of punctuation marks in the Hebrew has obscured this deliciously playful thrust of YHWH's. Moses is not abashed. Having been caught out, he might as well hang for a sheep as for a lamb! You ask if that is what I will settle for? Yes, that and only that. No angel. You Yourself — or nothing! And in explicating his ultimatum — an ultimatum which resonates with his ultimatum in Episode G — he again underlines that what is involved is not merely the question of YHWH's favor to him personally. When he was still being coy in his approach, asking for the favor of a road-map, he asked it as a favor to himself, but added, "and acknowledge that that nation is Your people." Now again he emphasizes that there is no separating him from his people: Your accompanying us in Person can alone distinguish us — "me and Your people" — from all the rest of mankind. Episode Episode J 17) YHWH said to Moses, "With this thing also which you pro pose will I comply, [to show] that you have, indeed, gained My favor, that I have singled you out by name." 18) He said, "Make visible to me Your Presence!" 19) He said, "I will parade My benev olence before you, herald for you the name YHWH, to wit: Who it is to whom I show favor, who it is to whom I show love." 20) [The meaning of what] He said: "You may not see My face, for no human can gaze upon Me and survive." 2 1) YHWH said, "Here, close by Me, is a spot — where you are to position yourself — on the crag. 22) Lo, the moment that My Presence goes on parade I shall place you in a cleft of the crag, with My hand block your vision, until I have passed by. 23) Then shall I remove My hand, so that you may see My back. My face, however, may not be seen." Verse 17 is both the conclusion of Episode I and the beginning of this one, so tightly are the two joined. YHWH's unqualified acceptance of Moses' ultimatum leaves us totally unprepared for Moses' response. At a point where we might have expected "Finis," or, at the most, "Thank You," we get instead a peremptory imperative from the mouth of the mortal. And the jarring tone of Moses' command is matched by the audaciousness of its substance. The Hebrew word kavod, correctly trans lated Presence here, most often appears in the sense of honor, glory. In a few cases it has the sense of body or person', and with the pronominal suf fixes of the first, second and third person, it stands, respectively, for I/Me/Myself, You/Yourself, He/Him/Himself. Moses' abrupt response to his God's gracious yielding to his own cautiously developed petition is,</page><page sequence="28">28 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [28] "Show Yourself to me, now!" And YHWH's response is an unruffled, albeit qualified, compliance. To appreciate the audacity of Moses and the complaisant response of God one must recall that throughout Scripture YHWH is pictured in terms of fearful fire and incandescent light. Mortals who trespass against Him or His sancta are incinerated or electrocuted. Frequently they are smitten by sanverim, a light so intense that it burns out the optic nerve when it does not cook the brain. Even the heavenly courtiers must be shielded from this power. Thus, for example, in the vision of Isaiah (Chapter 6), the serafim (a word probably connoting blazing creatures) who minister to YHWH in His celestial throne-room have six wings apiece: one pair for flying, one pair to cover their legs (a euphemism for pudenda), and one pair to cover their eyes. Such is the dazzling Presence which Moses asks to see! What would the narrator have us understand by this request of Moses that Deity should, so to speak, step out of the closet? The possibilities are as unlim ited as the power of imagination. One possibility cannot, in this context, be excluded. This episode is an expansion of the preceding one. Moses has insisted, and YHWH has agreed to accompany Israel in His own Per son. Moses now wants to be able to recognize that Person. To this desire, too, YHWH — to the extent that His nature and human limitation allow — is amenable. The narrator exploits the imagery of YHWH's deadly brilliance to tell us that Moses was granted a view of God, only a partial view — His non-radiant back, but at that, a fuller view than ever was vouchsafed to mortal being.19 That part or aspect of Deity is also charac terized as His goodness or benevolence, from which we may infer that the aspect denied to Moses was His awesomely destructive or malevolent power. But Moses will not only see, he will also hear. God will proclaim the essence contained in the Name: YHWH. In the episode which nar rates the carrying out of this promise of self-revelation, we shall see that both benevolence and malevolence are constitutive of that essence. But in this episode the proclamation to come is characterized only by the ( 1 g) The narrative of the theophany at Sinai, the revelation of the divine norms — syn optically in the Decalogue and expanded afterwards — the roles of Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Nadav and Abihu and the seventy elders in ascending to various elevations on the mount — all these events must also be read in terms of the episodic narrative technique and struc tured in time in accord with the synoptic-expansive narrative form. . . For the present, let us note the vision of the God of Israel beheld on the mount by Israel's representatives in Exodus 24:9-11. Whatever the function of this episode in the revelation and covenant making narrative, it is not to be assigned to an author other than that of the Golden Calf narrative, nor to be read as a contradiction of the theme here that no one can behold God and survive.</page><page sequence="29">[2g] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 2g attributes of benevolence: the Self-willed display of grace and love.20 Chapter 34 Episode Episode K 1) YHWH said to Moses, "Carve yourself two stone tablets like the first, and I will inscribe upon the tablets the words which were on the first set, which you shattered. 2) Be ready at dawn. At dawn, ascend Mount Sinai and present yourself to Me there, on the mountain peak. 3) No one is to come with you — indeed, no one is to appear anywhere on the mountain. Even flock and herd are not to graze opposite that mountain face." 4) He carved out two stone tablets like the first. Promptly at dawn, Moses climbed up Mount Sinai in obedience to YHWH's command, two stone tablets in hand. 5)YHWH descended in the cloud, stood by him there and made proclamation of the name, YHWH. 6) As YHWH paraded before him, He proclaimed: "YHWH — YHWH is Deity, loving and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in graciousness and truth, 7) extending grace to the thousandth generation, forbearing in regard to iniquity, transgression and sin. Yet by no means does He wipe the slate clean: For the iniquity of parents he calls to account children and grandchildren down to the third generation or the fourth." (20) Our rendering of wehannôtî ,et 0נser יי alio n \0' nhaintl 'et "Hrr ''"raheon, for all its depar ture from the standard translations, requires no justification. We would stress, however, that the nuance we read in this sentence is not to exclude other nuances better expressed by other renderings. This sentence is an expansion of the benevolence (jut') which YHWH will parade before Moses, a benevolence which is a general attribute of God's and relevant to many contexts; but in this particular context it is YHWH's benevolence to Israel which is in fine focus. The multivalence and ambiguity of the imperfect tense in biblical Hebrew is often exploited by Scripture's authors to make a statement in a broadly inclusive sense even while it is addressed to a particular context. Parallel to the sentence which is the subject of this note is the crux in Exod. 3.14, the "name" of God "7Ehyê י"ser *Ehyë." It conveys all the fol lowing senses: I am what I am, I am what I was, I am what I will be, I was what I am, I was what I was, I was what I will be, I will be what I am, I will be what I was, I will be what I will be. The verse goes on to say that for the Israelites the name °Ehyê (I am, I was, I will be) will suffice. And in the very next verse, in a switch to the third person, the name of this God in all its ontological excess is YHWH (suggestive otYihyê) Who for all His universality is, in this context, primarily the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. . . The play on the verb "to be" in the ça( tense does not rule out the possibility that the tetragram maton derives from the hiphcil of the verb to be, but the shading of the vowel in the imper feet prepositive, the shortening of the tetragrammaton to Ya, Yo and Ye, and the play here on the qal stem all suggest that little confidence is to be vested in the now general assump don that Yahweh represents a recovery of the name of Israel's God.</page><page sequence="30">go HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [30] 8) Moses quickly touched head to the ground and did obeisance. 9) He said, "If I have truly gained Your favor, my Lord, let my Lord, I pray, ever continue in our company — however stiffnecked a people it is — forgiving our iniquities and sins, taking us for Your own." This episode gives the context of YHWH's Self-revelation to Moses. It is to take place on Sinai's peak — confirming that the dialogues between God and Moses narrated in the preceding episode took place at the Tent of Meeting described in Digression A. The occasion is YHWH's act of grace, His reaffirmation or reinstitution of His covenant with Israel, symbolized by His inscribing a duplicate set of tablets. (Unlike the first set which were carved as well as inscribed by YHWH himself, these tab lets are carved by Moses — perhaps to suggest how important a role had been played by him in winning YHWH over to a renewal of the cove nant.) The idea, incorporated in the proclamation of YHWH's attributes, that He credits ancestral merit endlessly to later generations and calls only great-grandchildren, at the worst, to account for ancestral sins, is, of course, not new here. It appears first in the decalogue after the first two commandments, in expansion of the prohibition of wor shiping other gods along with YHWH or the manufacture and use of icons to represent Deity. In the decalogue, however, this expansion is essentially negative, for all that its substance is essentially positive. The infinite extension of reward and the limited extension of punishment is unquestionably an affirmation of His grace. In the decalogue, nonetheless, it follows a prohibition, the threat precedes the promise and the single explicit attribute of YHWH's is that He is "an exacting Deity" — which is to say, exacting in punishment. In this episode, by contrast, the promise precedes the threat, the latter included altogether only in order not to distort the full picture of YHWH's action in human affairs. Here, the attribute "an exacting Deity," is notably absent. For it has been replaced by the attributes of compassion or love, graciousness, patient tolerance, abundant and enduring favor. And that favor is char acterized not just by his carrying iniquity on the books, but iniquity, trans gressiongression and sin, i.e., offenses of every kind and degree. The formulation here is, then, altogether in consonance with the promise uttered in Epi sode J, the parading of YHWH's benevolence, a benevolence particu larly manifested to the people He now reclaims as His own, the benevo lence spelled out in the words, "who it is to whom I show favor, who it is to whom I extend love." Moses understands the full measure of grace which YHWH has</page><page sequence="31">[31] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 3 I affirmed; his posture of obeisance is in expression of grateful thanks. He has now witnessed the gracious Presence of YHWH, which will now accompany Israel as it resumes its journey to the promised land. But even at this point the narrator gives the prophet the last word, once again appealing for an ever greater measure of that grace. He has no illusions about the temptations his people will face before and after they enter that land, nor about their resoluteness in the face of those tempta tions. This is what he has in mind when he now characterizes his people as incorrigible — stiffnecked — and asks nonetheless for YHWH's awful Presence among them. Now for the first time he introduces a new word in his entreaty. He asks not for forbearance but for pardon, for forgiveness, which God — like a father — will be able to manage, if, as he says to Him, "You take us for your very own." Episode Episode L 10) He (YHWH) said, "Lo, I commit Myself in this covenant: With all your people as witness I shall work wonders never before wrought on earth, among any of its nations. And all this people — in whose company you are — will witness YHWH's doings, how awesome is the manner of My treating with you. This single verse, which we have marked off as a separate episode, is fol lowed by sixteen verses which constitute a second digression. To cite this Digression B and present the detailed comment it deserves would be inadvisable here. We might find it almost impossible to resume the thread of the narrative. Instead we shall present the salient points in it. Whereas YHWH's address in verse to, in the second person singular, is to Moses, that same second person singular address in the digression is to the people of Israel in its collectivity. The following is an itemization of the address: Digression Digression B 1. God will see to the defeat of the inhabitants of the promised land. Israel is forbidden to enter into any treaty of accommodation with them, lest they lure them into the snare of their pagan prac tices. 2. Israel is not to make castings representing Deity. 3. The first born male of any animal belongs to YHWH. If of edible animals, the male is to be gifted to the Temple; if it is of an animal that may not be eaten it must be redeemed with one that is</page><page sequence="32">32 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [32] edible, or destroyed; human firstborn males must be redeemed. 4. Only YHWH is to be worshiped. Homage is to be paid Him by the observance of the weekly day of cessation from labor, and by attendance at His earthly court, sacrificial gifts in hand, on the thrice-yearly pilgrimage festivals. 5. Bread offered together with animal slaughterings is not to be leavened; the meat of the paschal sacrificial meal is to be consumed by the celebrants or by fire before dawn; the choicest first-fruits of the harvests are to be brought to YHWH's court; the flesh of a kid is not to be prepared in milk taken from its own mother. Every one of these items (with two exceptions) appears — often in iden tical phrasing — in Exodus Chapter 23:12-33.21 The duplication of these (21) The two texts are reproduced in parallel columns to facilitate a study of their remarkable similarities. To be noted is a difference in juxtaposition which reveals how craftily the halakhic ordinances are fitted into their respective contexts. In Exodus 34, the catalogue is preceded by God's promise to Moses and seems to be a non-sequitur to that promise. In Exodus 23, this cultic catalogue follows an extensive list of moral prescriptions (the so-called Covenant Code) regulating relations between man and man; and is followed by the promise to the people of an agent who must be obeyed, for his being the vessel of "My Name" will preclude him from exercising the kind of forbearance which Moses will in the Golden Calf narrative plead that God exercise.

One exception is Item 2, prohibition of idols, absent in Chapter 23, and present in this catalogue which appears in the con text of the Golden Calf narrative! The second exception is the appear ance in this Digression of Item 3, the dedication of the firstborn males to YHWH. Its appearance here points to the ordination of the Aaronide priests, whose dedication to YHWH's service releases the firstborn of other Israelites from this obligation — upon the payment of a redemp Exodus Exodus 54 Exodus 25 Lo, you may worship no other god, for YHWH, exacting is His name, and exacting God is He — Lest, making a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, in their whor ish rites of their gods, when they make sacrifice to their gods, they invite you and you eat of such sacrifice; 16. and, taking wives for your sons from among their daughters, those daugh ters of theirs, a-whoring after their gods, lead your sons as well into whoring after their gods. 14.

A third link connecting this Digression with the narrative con text is the expression, in connection with the three yearly pilgrimage obligations, which literally reads, "to see the face of YHWH." No one, to be sure, not even Moses — as Episode J take pains to underline — can literally gaze upon the face of God. But even those words, a metaphor for the privilege of audience with a monarch, were regarded as too bla tantly anthropomorphic by the rabbis who transmitted the Hebrew text. To avoid the boldness of an image which, to their mind, bordered on the blasphemous, they vocalized the verb as a passive, yielding the sense "to be seen (by)" or "to appear (before)" YHWH. Little is lost to the reader in most instances where this substitution occurs. In this digression, however, it does serve to conceal the link between the privilege of the pilgrim visit to YHWH's shrine and Moses' beholding the Presence of YHWH. And this last, YHWH's Presence in Israel's midst, in the taber nacle constructed for His residence, is the fourth link to the Golden Calf narrative; for, as pointed out earlier, it is between the instructions for its building and the carrying out of those instructions that our entire narra tive is set. This recognition, that Chapters 32-34 is an episodic narrative within a larger narrative framework, helps us to solve another problem in Epi sode L. Episode L precedes Digression B. YHWH, addressing Moses, refers to Israel as "the people in whose company you are." So in our translation, and similarly in the older standard (and more literal) transla dons.

Thus, for example, the new JPS translation reads, band all the people — who are with youb" providing a note: "b b Lit. in whose midst you are." The Oxford New English Bible fails to translate these words alto gether and provides a version of God's words which is without any basis in the Hebrew original.22 The clue as to the intent of the literal Hebrew, "the people in whose midst you are," is provided in Chapter 23, verses 20-24, which follow the catalogue of prescriptions which are duplicated in our digression. These verses report YHWH's words: 20) Lo, I am sending an agent (or angel) before you to guard you on the way, and to bring you to the place I have appointed. 21) Take care in his presence, obey him; do not play the rebel with him, for he may not forbear in regard to any trangression on your part — since My Name is in him! 22) If you will only be obedient to him, doing all that I dictate, then shall I be enemy to your enemies and foe to your foes. 23) With my agent (angel) going before you — when he will have brought you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites, and I wreak depredation among them — 24) you are not to worship their gods, nor do them service, nor follow their practices. . . This passage contains the first reference to YHWH's plans to send an "angel" to lead Israel to the promised land. It is to this reference that YHWH therefore reverts in Episode H when He first explains why He cannot accompany Israel in His own Person. It is the identity of this angel which Moses, in Episode I, declares that YHWH has not revealed to him, and whose company be respectfully declines. In Episodes J and Exodus Exodus 34 Exodus 23 25.

And this without a marginal note to the unwary reader!</page><page sequence="36">36 HERBERT CHANAN BR1CHTO [36] K, Moses is granted a peek at YHWH's Presence which will accompany Moses, obviating the necessity for an angel. Now in Episode L we learn at last who the "angel" was whom YHWH had in mind back in Chapter 23, the agent who would lead Israel to the boundary of the promised land but would not himself enter it. That "angel" which YHWH promised Israel, that "angel" in whom YHWH would be present ("for My Name will be in him"), is no angel at all. It is the man, Moses! The wonder that YHWH will work "with all your people as witness," "the wonder never before wrought on earth," the wonder of "My awesome manner in treating with you," Moses, to be witnessed by "all this people in whose midst you are," Moses — is that I, YHWH, will be present in you, and will thereby be present in the midst of the people — "in whose midst you are." Will we ever again underestimate the craft of an author who can bury the Prelude to the narrative of the Golden Calf in Chapter 23, and then provide a clue to its existence by a seemingly pointless commonalty of context, all to achieve what? A surprise ending? Yes, that too. But primarily, as we shall see, to cloak a breathtaking metaphor. A metaphor expressing God's presence in man.23 Episode Episode M 27) YHWH said to Moses, "Write down these words, for these words are the conditions for the covenant I make with you and with Israel." 28) There he abided with YHWH forty days and forty nights. He ate not a morsel of bread, took not a sip of water. While He inscribed upon the tablets the terms of the covenant — the Ten Commandments. 29) When Moses came down from Mount Sinai — the two tablets of the Pact in Moses' hand, and Moses unaware that the skin of his face had become radiant in the course of His speaking with him — 30) then, when Aaron and all the Israelites beheld Moses — and lo, the skin of his face was radiating light — they shrank from coming near him. 31) But Moses called out to them, so that Aaron and the elect of the Assembly came back to him, and Moses addressed them. 32) After this all the rest of the Israelites drew near, and he charged them with all that YHWH had addressed to him on Mount (23) The metaphor, so baldly put, would seem to be so commonplace as to be congenial even to the most agnostic of humanists. Yet this metaphor reemerges in the extension of the "Old Testament"; to it is traceable the schism among the biblical religionists of the household of Israel; this re-emergent metaphor, taken literally, will be blasphemy to some of the latter and to others of them the quintessence of God's revealed truth.</page><page sequence="37">[37] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 37 Sinai. 33) When Moses finished his discourse to them, he placed a veil over his face. 34) [And so it was that] whenever Moses entered YHWH's près ence to speak with Him, he would put the veil aside — even until he had left the audience. He would then go out and address to Israel what he had been charged with. 35) And the Israelites would behold the face of Moses, how the skin of Moses' face did radiate with light. Only then would Moses put the veil back over his face — until his next entrance to audience with Him. In this, the concluding episode, we are told that the second audience of Moses with YHWH on the mountain equalled the first in duration. Forty days and nights, a round number for an indeterminate, but lengthy stay, during which he consumed neither food nor drink, sustained rather by the grace of God. The catalogue of prescriptions for the proper ways to do homage to YHWH, the contents of Digression B, are the words which Moses is bidden to write down for himself. In all probability, this cata logue itself, characterized as the conditions imposed on Israel for the covenant with God, are only intended as an abstract of the fuller instruc tions which follow in the rest of Exodus as well as in parts of Leviticus and Numbers. Hence the lengthy stay on the mountain. The decalogue itself, as consistently described elsewhere, was inscribed by YHWH Him self. The concluding notice bears out our interpretation of Episode L. The radiance emanating from the face of Moses is a visible token of the près ence of YHWH, the Radiant Presence, in the person of the prophet. The symbolism of the radiance is sharpened by the detail of the veil. The prophet, for all the immanence of Deity within him, continues to be a human and mortal, flesh and blood, living out his own personal con cerns and aspirations. In the privacy of his own person and preoccupations, the immanence is yet there, dimmed or veiled. In each audience with his God, the veil is removed and the radiance is renewed or recharged, and the veil remains removed until the people and its leaders can witness the radiance of God's truth even as they hear its words from the mouth of the prophet who represents them to Him and Him to them. The piecemeal presentation of this three-chapter narrative and of the commentary in analysis of its formal structure and of its story line has been necessitated by a number of factors: that it was composed in an ancient tongue reflecting the conventions of an ancient civilization; that</page><page sequence="38">38 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [38] it therefore required a new translation, one often at odds with the many standard and often mistaken renderings; and, lastly, that it constitutes but one unit in a much larger narrative in whose context alone it can be comprehended. The reader who would arrive at a full appreciation of this achievement of narrative rhetoric, or who would question our analy sis of it in whole or in part, would be well advised to reread the narrative without the interrupting commentary. He would then see, we believe, that the narrative contains not a superflous word. Not a word or phrase is repeated except to advance the author's argument. There is not, in these 93 verses, a single contradiction or inconsistency, except for those occasioned by the narrator's conscious shift of voice or variation of meta phor. In outline form, we may review the narrative as follows: Episode A tells of the mysterious production of a golden artifact, hailed as a god responsible for a chapter of history which took place before its production, its projected role to replace a human leader who never returned from a solitary audience with an invisible Deity on the cloud-enshrouded peak of a mount whose name is Sere or Barren (Horeb). Episode B takes place up there amid the clouds. The lost leader, Moses, is informed by his God, YHWH, after forty days and nights of discourse, that he must return to his people camped at the base of the mountain. The reason: they have committed the sin of making an idol, a golden bull, in direct contravention of one of YHWH's commands so recently addressed to them. Episode C reveals that this bottom line, permission to rejoin his peo pie and resume his leadership role was not easily arrived at. Moses had first to implore his God not to punish the people with a well-merited annihilation. Episode D. Moses descends from the peak, picking up his faithful attendant Joshua halfway down the slope. Moses cannot make out the nature of the sounds emanating from the camp. This, and his shock at beholding the idol, suggest that the narrator, in putting mention of the specific nature of the sin in the mouth of YHWH was employing the device of free direct discourse. That is, God told Moses of a heinous sin but did not give the specifics. The reason for the specific is to emphasize for the reader the heinous nature of this particular transgression — "idolatry" — in the eyes of God. Moses in anger and despair shatters the Covenant Tablets, reduces the idol to gold dust and has the entire peo pie drink water upon which the dust has been sprinkled. Episode E reveals that before Moses so treated the idol he charged his</page><page sequence="39">[39] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 39 brother Aaron with the responsibility for leading the people into the sinful act. Aaron denied responsibility, claimed that the production of the bull was a miraculous event. This claim of Aaron's, readily confirma ble by the many witnesses, goes unquestioned. Episode F. Moses calls for volunteers to rally to God's cause against the instigators of the idolatry. The Levites answer the call and at the command of Moses, spoken in the name of YHWH, traverse the camp, executing the criminals in the number of some three thousand. Their ability to single out the instigators is implicit; it goes without comment. The narrator permits the thought to dawn upon us: that ability is related to the gold-dust potion administered by Moses to all Israel. Before the execution, we are told in conclusion, Moses had the Levites dedicate their hands to YHWH. This precaution we are told is to ensure YHWH's blessing on the Levites, a word pointing implicitly to the favored role this tribe will play in the Temple cult and, explicitly, to the immunity from blood vengeance for their slaying of their kinsmen. Episode G. Moses returns to YHWH (at a spot undisclosed) to propiti ate Him and win a stay of sentence for the Israelites who tolerated the idolatry. Harking back to Episode C, YHWH's proposal to destroy Israel and replace it with Moses' descendants, Moses achieves his goal. Moses is given permission to resume the march of Israel to the promised land. He is told that YHWH will supply him with an angelic guide. Stay of sentence, YHWH emphasizes, is only a suspended sentence. At some late date, we are informed, Israel was punished for its role as accessory to idolatry and their offense was thus expiated. Episode H. YHWH's reason for sending an angel, rather than Him self accompanying Israel on its trek, is given. The reason, a judgment on Israel's incorrigibility, eventuates in Israel's assuming a stance of mourn ing. This stance is further explicated. Israel remained under judgment from Mount Horeb on — until, that is, the occasion of expiation antic ipated in the concluding notice of Episode G. Episode H is followed by Digression A. Inasmuch as we are not here given information on where, at which camping site in the Sinai wilderness, the tabernacle was constructed — or, for that matter, at which point in time — the last mention of Horeb provides a felicitous point at which the narrator may fill in a number of details whose absence would make the episodic narrative technique even more confusing than it has already proved to be to generations of interpreters. This digres sion tells us how and where Moses had audience with YHWH on other than the two occasions when he climbed Horeb's peak. More important it contrasts the occasional descent of YHWH in the Cloud Pillar to speak</page><page sequence="40">4&lt;3 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [40] to Moses at the entrance of his improvised Tent of Encounter with His taking up residence, so to speak, in the tabernacle Tent of Encounter which is yet to be constructed. And it thereby prepares us further for the issue at stake in the episodes to come: Will YHWH be present in Person or in the person of an intermediary angel? Episode I. YHWH divines Moses' reluctance to settle for an angel in place of His own Presence. Episode J. YHWH accedes to Moses' request. Moses boldly asks for a view of the Presence which will accompany Israel and himself. YHWH agrees to show him what it is that a mortal may glimpse. The revelation will take place on the mountain peak, the walls of a rock cleft serving as blinders on either side and YHWH's outstretched palm blocking a fron tal view until He has passed by. The back of YHWH, which Moses is to see, symbolizes — if nothing else — a parallel expression of what YHWH will disclose: his attributes of benevolence and love. Episode K. Moses carves out two stone tablets and ascends the peak, where YHWH will duplicate the words he had inscribed on the first set. He parades, as He has promised, before Moses, proclaiming His benevolence, a benevolence which does not, however, preclude punish ment for past sins. Moses gratefully acknowledges this reassurance. He asks, however, that YHWH, accompanying Israel in His own Person, show His love not only by granting stays of sentence but by full forgive ness of the people He is reclaiming as His own. Episode L. YHWH responds with a promise to Moses personally. He will treat Moses in a way unheard of since time began. Digression B then follows, a catalogue of prescriptions for the proper worship of YHWH. This digression, identical in large measure with a catalogue in Chapter 23 of Exodus, points to the significance of an earlier episode. For this first catalogue is immediately followed by a promise of YHWH to Israel that He will be present among them in the person of an agent, or angel. The reader now can grasp the intent of that first promise, now clarified, in Episode L in the promise to Moses. The agent in whom YHWH's Presence will be immanent is no angel at all, rather the prophet Moses. Episode M. The tablets are inscribed by YHWH. Moses' second stay on the peak equals in duration his first audience on the mount. In the course of the forty days he receives additional details of YHWH's cove nant stipulations with Israel. YHWH's Presence in Moses is disclosed in a divine radiance illuminating his face, a radiance whose intensity will be renewed in his every subsequent audience with YHWH, a radiance dis played to Moses' Israelite audience every time he relates to them the instruction of YHWH.</page><page sequence="41">[41] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 41 C. Interpretation With our analysis of the text completed, we are in a position to address ourselves to the synthetic question: What is the essential message of the narrative? Or since there may be several messages, all essential, what is its central or core meaning? The reader, armed with our translation and commentary, is probably as competent as we are to work out an answer for himself. The cogency or persuasiveness of our own conclusions we must leave, without false modesty, to the judgment of the reader. But in addressing this question we must raise a number of considerations deriving from a broader acquaintance with the literature of the ancient Near East and with the biblical books as a whole. The first of these considerations is the nature of that phenomenon which we label idolatry. This term is variously used in senses ranging from the narrow and literal, to the broadly figurative or metaphoric. Lit erally construed, idolatry means the worship of man-made images as gods. Which is to say that the sculpted or cast form is not for the wor shiper merely a representation of superhuman or supernatural powers, but rather the very embodiment of those powers. The ascription of such powers to an object or collection of objects is covered, however, more precisely by another, newer term: fetishism. If we then consider that fetishism derives from the realm of magic — in which powers are manip ulated or coerced — whereas idolatry derives from the domain of reli gion — where powers are petitioned, or addressed in worship — we shall have to conclude that idolatry in the literal sense, i.e., worship of powers that are manipulated, is essentially a self-contradiction. Either an idol is merely a representation of powers that exist beyond it, and serves to help the worshiper focus on those powers, or it is a fetish — in which case it is not, properly speaking, worshiped at all. Voltaire, more than two centuries ago, perceived that no pagan in antiquity, however benighted, would have recognized himself as an idol ater in the literal sense. And everything we know about the religions of the ancient Near East (or anywhere else, for that matter) confirms Voltaire in his perception. Gods — cosmic, regional, tutelary, or what ever — were represented in various forms or shapes, often mounted on pedestals in the shape of one animal or another so that the pedestal image by itself might represent the majesty of the god in question. And though these images were venerated, they were not worshiped. No more than a flag is worshiped, for all that its desecration will be deemed an insult to the national sovereignty it symbolizes. Idolatry, then, is a term rarely, if ever, meaningfully used in the literal sense. And in its meta</page><page sequence="42">42 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [42] phoric usage it is not so much a descriptive as it is a value term. Idolatry is a judgment, the attribution to another of the worship of false gods or the pursuit of false values. As today, so then; as then, so today. And the figurative, polemical deployment of this concept is never more clear than when it appears in the hyperbole of lampoon. As for example, when the prophet in Isaiah 44 describes the idolater who fells a tree, uses part of the wood for a fire to warm himself, part to cook his meal, and carves the rest into a shape before which he prostrates himself in worship, his prayer, "Save me, for you are my god!" Another consideration is the predilection for the use of images in worship (iconoplasm) in some religions and its proscription (iconoclasm) in others. Monotheism need not necessarily be iconoclastic, although biblical monotheism was, and polytheism need not be iconoplastic, although pagan religions have been so. It would seem, indeed, that reli gious iconoclasm is a phenomenon attested only for biblical religion in antiquity and derivatives of that tradition in our own day. And the ques don that we must ask is, why? Why is Scripture so adamant in its icono clasm? What is wrong with the rendering of the abstract into the con creteness of three-dimensional imagery? It is these very questions, we would submit, which lie implicitly behind the narrative of the Golden Calf and its aftermath, and which are answered in the strands of its mythopoeic development. The crux of the matter lies in the first two commandments of the decalogue, the two so closely connected as to be almost indivisible. The introduction to the decalogue in Exodus is 20:2, "I YHWH, am your God, Who liberated you from the land of Egypt, the house of bond age." The first command is verse 3, "You shall have no other gods along side of me." This prohibition does not, in itself, deny the existence of other numina, divine agencies of major or minor order. In contrast with pagan practice, which often portrays a chief god's hospitable relations with kindred deities, often providing them with quarters in his own pal ace or niches in his own temple, YHWH forbids the association with Him of any such divinity. The second command is verse 4, "You shall not make for yourself a sculpted image, of any likeness that exists in the skies above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth." Verse 5, underlining the seriousness of what precedes, applies to both preceding commands, "You shall pay them no homage or service. ..." A point which often fails of appreciation is that the proscription of images is not in reference to representations of other deities, for worship of these and, a a fortiori, of representations of them, have already been precluded in the first command. The second command forbids the representation of</page><page sequence="43">[43] WORSHIP OF THE GOLDEN CALF 43 YHWH by any image. In Deuteronomy 4, when Moses expands on this prohibition — listing the likenesses of male or female, beast, bird, lizard, fish, celestial bodies such as sun, moon, stars — he makes this explicit in verse 15, "Take care for your very lives! For you saw no likeness (of any sort) at the time when YHWH spoke to you at Horeb, from within the flame." In other words, you cannot represent YHWH in any natural likeness — fauna or celestial luminary — for you saw no image when He revealed Himself to you. Now let us review the elements featured in our narrative. 1. Moses as the intermediary between YHWH and Israel. 2. A representation in three-dimensions, its substance gold, its nor mal manufacture by casting in a mold — which turns out to be a bull image — to replace the missing human intermediary, Moses. The char acterization of this image as "a god" — clearly representing the Power which brought Israel up from Egypt. 3. After the destruction of the bull-image and the execution of those who instigated its production, the question of YHWH's grace in forbear ing to punish the rest of Israel for their complicity. This question repeat edly formulated in terms of the expansion which, in the decalogue, fol lows the first two commandments. 4. The theme of the Presence of YHWH in the midst of Israel — first in the context of the ordaining of the Tabernacle in which YHWH will be present in His Person. In connection with that Tabernacle, the elec tion to YHWH's ministry of the priestly Aaronides and their Levitical tribesmen. 5. The theme of the Presence of YHWH in the midst of Israel, for the duration of the trek to the promised land. His presence in His Per son in contrast to this presence in an angelic intermediary. 6. The resolution of the question in favor of YHWH's direct Près ence — despite the risks entailed by the awesomeness of this powerful Presence in the midst of a people with a propensity for sinfulness — on the strength of YHWH's grace and love. 7. The inseparability of Moses and Israel, leader and led. 8. The full measure of YHWH's grace revealed in the unprece dented Presence of YHWH — not in an angel, nor in the Tabernacle, but rather — in the person of the mortal, the prophet, Moses. The immanence of Deity in man symbolized by the divine light radiating from his face. 9. The dawning awareness of the reader that the catalogue prescribing proper worship of YHWH, inserted in the narrative as a</page><page sequence="44">44 HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO [44] digression, is a repetiuon of the catalogue already given in Chapter 23. But this time with the addition of one element and one element alone from the decalogue, the prohibition of manufacture of mold-casted "gods." And the realization that the angel/agent promised by YHWH to Israel in connection with the catalogue in Chapter 23, the angel/agent in whom YHWH will be present ("My Name is in him"), had as its original intention no angel at all, but as now emerges from the denouement, the human prophetic agent, Moses. Biblical iconoclasm is not in derogation of man's esthetic creativity. Painting and sculpture are no more proscribed than is poetic imagery — imagery so bold as to picture a mortal given a glimpse of God's Person. Only the representation of YHWH in sculpted or cast form is prohib ited. And this prohibition is limited to forms copied from nature. Fan tasy images, not copied from nature, such as the cherubim which consti tute the throne of the Invisible God atop the pedestal of the Ark of the Covenant, are not only not proscribed, they may be prescribed. The immanence of God among men is not to be sought in form of fauna or celestial bodies; it may be manifest on occasion in numinous "angels," it is ideally best manifested in God's most special creation, the species which was alone "created in the very image and likeness of God" (Genesis 1:26). This species alone can know and fulfill the will of God. This potential is realizable in the prototypical human-at-its best and most faithful to God, the prophetic exemplar. Is it any wonder that when the prophet Hosea chides the patriarch Jacob/Israel for having traffic with angels instead of invoking God directly, by His name YHWH, he reminds the Israel of his own day: "But it was by a prophet that YHWH brought Israel up from Egypt, and it was by a prophet that it (Israel) was preserved!" (Hosea 12:14).</page></plain_text>
