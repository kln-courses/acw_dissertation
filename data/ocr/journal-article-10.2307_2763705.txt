<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS' EDWARD CARY HAYES University of Illinois A philosophy is almost as necessary to civilized society as a language. The philosophy that civilized society must have is an ethics-not this or that particular ethics but some ethics or other- that is to say, some generally accepted idea or ideas adapted to give direction and momentum to life. The ethics of yesterday was largely based on legalistic religion, on the thought of divine law enforcible by rewards and punishments here and hereafter. Today the fear of hell and hope of heaven and belief in the intervention of "special providence" in behalf of the good man and in disfavor of the bad man play greatly dimin- ished roles in the control ot life. Moreover, deeply as we may regret it, we cannot fail to observe that the sense of divine companionship which so refined and ennobled some lives and developed such staunch ethical reliability has tended to fade out of the social con- sciousness as anthropomorphic conceptions of God have been replaced by philosophic pantheism or agnosticism. Religious ethics was for a time reinforced by " moral philosophy "; but moral philosophy like that of Kant was unscientific and is now discredited and for most minds dead. Look at Germany! Neither the religion of Luther nor the philosophy of Kant2 guides her life. Her national policy exhibits a more than barbarous unmorality. And moral disintegration is by no means peculiar to Germany. A large part of our own popular fiction consists in the subtlest advocacy of a pseudo-scientific unmorality. If a critic raises his voice in defense of the "mid- Victorian" decencies and sanctities he is greeted with a chorus I Selections from the two opening chapters of a forthcoming book. 2 Kant taught the absolutism of moral law, and Professor Dewey thinks that his iiifluence has degenerated into a prop for the unmoral absolutism of Prussian govern- ment. 289</page><page sequence="2">290 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY of scoffs and jeers. We are assured that nothing is wrong that is "natural," that in nature there is no higher and no lower, that altruism is only a form of selfishness, and that reason has no pre- cedence over the instincts that we share with the beasts. Among "the intellectuals," "the emancipated," "the enlightened youth," the leaders and makers of our future, great numbers are moving rapidly and with gathering momentum toward an abyss not wholly unlike that into which Germany has fallen. That abyss is no less deep and dark and noisome because with us unmorality takes the form of private rather than national individualism. Now if this doctrine of "the emancipated" is a true statement of the facts of human existence, and if the moral distinction between right and wrong is an old wives' nursery fable designed to scare a juvenile and timorous humanity, outgrown by the men of a scien- tific age, or if it is an invention devised and perpetuated in the inter- est of the many weak in Qrder to bind the strong and is an insult to the right and might of supermen-if moral restraints are only an attempt to curb the "natural " current of full, free, and rich life, then we cannot hide the fact from an adult and scientific world, and we may as well plunge at once into the melee of ravening beasts and let nonsurvival take the hindmost. But does that "doctrine of the emancipated" present a true or a false conception of human life? That is the sole question. Are ravening individualism and ruthless war of groups the method of survival for creatures capable of rational organization ? Are the characteristic values of human experience obtainable by the unregu- lated operation of instincts which we share with animals that have not evolved to the level of gregarious life? Are those values obtainable by the operation of any instincts undirected by reason, or do instincts stimulated and guided by the conclusions of reason yield a richer life than irrational impulses do ? If so what are the conclusions of adequately enlightened reason that afford the neces- sary guidance to instinctive promptings ? Does the realization of the biggest net total of human values require the subordination of this or that particular instinct to the harmonious totality of experi- ence ? Does it even require the organization of the activities of individuals into a regulated system of co-operation? And is it</page><page sequence="3">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 29I required by the nature of the situation that men and women, in order to be capable of the richest individual life and capable of social co-operation on which the greatest net total of individual good depends, must have developed personalities that are products not only of biological but also of social evolution? None of these questions can be finally answered by any kind of dogmatizing or conceptual philosophizing, but only by a genuinely unbiased study of the facts of life as it is lived by men in society. Will the next generation have an ethics ? It will not get its ethics by going backward to mid-Victorian dogmas and specula- tions. If it has an ethics fit for the demands of social order and progress it will discover it by going forward along the path of science-not along the path of a priori speculation or mystic faith, but along the path of science. And the only science that can equip us with an ethics is the scientific study of human life, that is to say of social life, for man's life becomes human in the significant and distinctive sense only in society and by the methods of causation involved in the cumulative effects of association. In other words sociology, whether called by that name or not, is our only hope for an adequate ethics. The physicists tell us that the chair in which I am comfortably seated is a stable balance of ionic action, and that if this ionic action were released from the orderly system in which it proceeds it would blow me and my whole environment to less than atoms. Similarly the instinctive action of human individuals is correlated into a comfortable social order, and if the energies of instinctive action were released from orderly and systematic control society would pass into dissolution and decay or chaotic explosion. Primi- tive men could live together only in little hordes. Beyond the horde was war. The organized co-operation of millions is the supreme product of social evolution, an evolution that has been largely unplanned and uncomprehended. That evolution is not complete. The possibilities of social organization and of individual experience for the masses of mankind are as yet unrealized. In every age men of insight and deep human interest have declared the shortcoming of the society to which they belonged and assured us that we live only along the margin of the fields of realization that we might</page><page sequence="4">292 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY enter. Even savages and barbarians have had their messianic hopes and prophecies. Unrealized good is always within view and barely beyond our reach. It is beyond us only because there is nowhere a society that has developed an adequate ethics. Ethics is always founded on an understanding, a theory, or a faith. Change men's ideas and thereupon their sentiments and conduct change. As a man dozing by the fireside is roused to a fury of action if his wife announces that upstairs the attic is in a blaze, so an ambitionless idler may be converted into a zealot, or a stagnant and decadent society may arise to heights of achievement if sufficiently propulsive ideas are adopted. If the sentiments radiated throughout society rose from apprehension or even a remote approach toward apprehension of the human values at stake and of the way in which commonplace conduct fits into a scheme of things on which the realization or forfeiture of these values depends, men might be aroused to a joy in zestful endeavor and a constancy in sentiment and purpose known only to the most fortunate. We might have an enthusiasm of generous motive in time of peace not inferior to that evoked by war. An individual to be happy and powerful and a society to be progressive and con- structive must have ideas that are both propulsive and exalted. If there are no such ideas that are true, then individuals and society are doomed to disappointment, disillusionment, and decay. If there are such ideas, then their discovery and promulgation till they are embodied in the common sense of the masses of mankind are the profoundest of all human needs. The ideas by which individual and social life has been organized during the nineteenth century are fading out from men's minds. The mind of man will learn all that it can learn. That is inevitable and we must take the consequences. We cannot permanently protect faith by any ignorance that science can dispel. First the teachers and then the taught, gradually and increasingly, will discard all illusions and faiths that cannot survive in the presence of all the knowledge that we possess or can acquire. As yet many have neither received the existing knowledge that will ultimately become common property nor come under the influence of teachers who have received it; but this is only a temporary condition.</page><page sequence="5">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 293 Others, who are among the enlightened, are so deeply under the influence of the teachings of their youth and the prestige of organ- ized systems of thought that they are able to close their eyes to the implications of their scientific knowledge. A few boldly declare: "My science and my faith are incompatible, but I cannot live without my faith, so I retain it simply because I must and will." To those who retain their faith in divine companionship for human endeavor the search for the guiding facts of social life will be nothing less than an attempt to discover the laws of God as revealed in the terms of the problem which he has set us. To those who feel no kindling of the moral flame at thought of any personality above mankind nor any consolation drawn from beyond the com- pass of the life we know, that search is the quest for the rationale of our existence, for the only source of guidance and motive by which our life can escape a reductio ad absurdum, and for the matter-of- fact method of individual endeavor and social co-operation which alone can disclose whatever of meaning and worth our life contains and afford guidance and zest, exaltation and power. Such a transition as now is taking place presents two phases: the revision or rejection of old and the development of new views. The tendency is to remove the sills and timbers of the old structure of ideas before there is anything to put in their places. There are two ways in which men strive to escape from the resulting disturb- ance or destruction of their own life and that of society. The first way is to strive to perpetuate or re-establish the old. The second way is to strive to build the new and to press toward the views of human life that are disclosed by the light of fullest knowledge. This latter course appears to have been relatively little followed by men of the profoundest moral earnestness. It is time to realize that it is not by reluctant and grudging and timorous admissions that we can best approach the actual truth about life but by courageous and zealous search for the truth. The way out is not backward but forward; backward we cannot turn. The way to shorten the period of transition, disorganization, and lack of social agreement upon the fundamentals of a life-policy is cordially to accept the results and the methods of science and to push on toward more adequate comprehension. It is a tragedy if the men of greatest</page><page sequence="6">294 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY moral earnestness, that is, the men of deepest interest in the human values at stake, are to hold back. Sociology sprang from two roots, one in scientific the other in practical interest. As a scientific movement, its first great names are those of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. As a practical movement, its origin is represented by such names as those of John Ruskin, William Morris, Frederick Dennison Maurice, and Arnold Toynbee. Whatever may be thought of the fruits of their labors, the sociological movement has never been without adherents whose personal and intellectual qualities command respect. These two roots out of which sociology has sprung correspond to the two great changes that differentiate the modern mental outlook from that of the past. The first of these is the "scientific spirit," the second is the "social spirit." The scientific spirit is the tendency and determination, in study- ing every division of reality, to replace mere speculation guided by prejudice and preference by the patient investigation of facts through the application of the experimental or the comparative method, and by the interpretation of facts in accordance with the hypothesis that among them all there is a universal causal inter- relationship.' The second great difference between the present and the past is the social spirit. The social spirit is the sense that the normal goal of human endeavor is the realization of life's possibilities of good, not by a few whose welfare rests upon the bent backs of the mass but by all normal human beings in proportion as they are endowed with the possibilities of good experience. Given the advent of the scientific spirit and of the social spirit, the coming of sociology was just as inevitable as any other step in evolution when the antecedent conditions are fulfilled. Sociology in one of its aspects is an intellectual movement which consists in carrying the scientific attitude into the study of human life. In its other aspect sociology consists in turning our minds to the great I To common sense the expressions " facts " and " causal interrelationship " are perfectly intelligible, but speculative skepticism, while groping for solutions, has surrounded them with a smother of obscurity. I must use these and similar expres- sions with the meanings which we are obliged to give to them in everyday practical life and in science.</page><page sequence="7">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 295 task to which humanity in general has thus far never set itself, the necessarily co-operative task of the comprehensive realization of life's possibilities of good experience. Obviously these two aspects of sociology, if successfully carried out, would be related to each other as any science is related to its applications. And, as obviously, science must come before the applications of science. The greatest danger of sociology is that eagerness for application will divert men from the strictly scientific pursuit upon which both comprehension and application ultimately depend. Preoccupation with practical aims may even obscure the fact that sociology has a distinctive scientific task. Practical aims cannot be expected to define the field of a science. Such aims are likely to call, not for the application, still less for the creation, of a single science, but rather for the application of any number of sciences. Thus scientific agriculture is not itself a science but a combination of applications of z6ology, botany, chemistry, physics, and even economics. And scientific medicine is the application of numerous sciences, including physiology, bacteriology, chemistry, psychology, and physics (with its trusses, splints, bone-splicing, radium and Rontgen rays). Likewise, the solution of concrete problems of social welfare may require the application of many sciences. Successful practice requires the combination of knowl- edge drawn from all the sciences that apply to the purpose in hand, and there is no absurdity when the agriculturist combines knowl- edge drawn from biology, chemistry, and economics, or when the physician combines knowledge drawn from physiology, bacteriology, chemistry, and physics, or when the social worker, together with the application of his knowledge about customs, organizations, and other social facts, combines application of knowledge about tene- ment architecture, sanitary engineering, and of any applicable physical science. One may believe that sociology is becoming a "practical science" in the sense in which agriculture and medicine are "practical sciences" and still doubt whether it can ever be a truly fundamental science. I am not employing the name "sociol- ogy " to designate merely the effort to concentrate all possible light upon certain pressing practical problems. I assume that to be a perfectly normal exercise of intelligence. But there are distinctly</page><page sequence="8">296 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY social facts and there should be distinctly social science. The only question is how many social sciences should there be. The word "sociology" at the head of this paper does not refer merely, nor mainly, to "social economics" nor "social technology," con- sidered as the art of applying all pertinent knowledge to the problems of general welfare, but rather to sociology as a specific fundamental science, that is, as an effort to analyze, evaluate, and account for the content of human life, in terms applicable to all its divisions, economic, political, ethical, and whatever else, in so far as the content of human life is made up of ideas, sentiments, and practices that are inot peculiar to individuals but are the common property of groups and that have resulted from a social evolution. Now ethics also, like sociology, has both a practical and a theoretical side. Ethics in its practical, as distinguished from its scientific, aspect is the sum total of those requirements of wisdom and knowledge which at one juncture or another may become the "duty" of a good man. And ethics of this practical sort, if ade- quately informed, would be closely related tQ "practical" sociology if not identical with it. The distinction between the two would be that hitherto practical ethics has emphasized the individual aspect and practical sociology the social aspect of life, which is after all one life having both aspects. As a result of this difference of emphasis sociology has given more attention to detailed informa- tion about the opportunities and requirements of co-operative service than has practical ethics. But all would agree that these requirements of co-operative service are properly within the scope of practical ethics. It is equally true, though not so obvious, that the most private and personal moral endeavor is based on judgments and sentiments that have been developed through social experience and spread by social contacts. Furthermore the theoretical or fundamental aspects of ethics and of sociology coincide as truly as do their practical aspects. Ethics in its more fundamental aspect is a set of general questions about life with tentative or final answers to these questions. The thesis of this essay is that sociology as a science, or at least as an attempt to carry on a study of life in a scientific spirit, cannot escape those very questions which are the problems of ethics, and furthermore</page><page sequence="9">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 297 that the only intellectually satisfying method of seeking the answers to those questions is to be found, not in a priori speculation, which has been the historical method in ethics, but rather in that investigation of the facts of human life which is the work of sociology. However, the title "Sociology as Ethics" is not intended to mean that sociology is ethics and nothing else. Sociology is the attempt to study in a truly scientific spirit and by a broadly com- parative method that conscious life of man which is also the life of society and which can evolve as it does only in society and as the life of society. It must seek to give an objectively true description of all the general traits of that life, of the forms of determining relationship between that life and its material environment, and between the various parts included in that life itself. It is a suffi- ciently huge claim for sociology to say that sociology is ethics. But one cannot look upon the task just stated without seeing that sociology of this fundamental sort, if it is anything valid, must be scientific ethics and also much more besides. The descriptive analysis of social life and of the types of interrelationship by which its content is determined apply to the elucidation, not only of those differences in human experience considered as an end which are designated by the terms "good" and "evil," not only to these and to the evolution of those judgments and sentiments as to human conduct considered as a means which constitute the vary- ing conscience codes of different peoples, but they apply also to the evolution of languages, religions, governments and laws, eco- nomic wants and practices, aesthetic arts, and plays and ceremonies. The Australian's code for dividing a kangaroo with his relatives, American football and baseball, trial by jury, monogamy, baptism by immersion, a vocabulary, or any other social reality, and even the separate strands of idea, sentiment, and overt practice that are woven into such social realities have all had a social evolu- tion to which the same principles of explanation are applicable. Geographic conditions mold religion and morality as well as government and language. The psychophysical traits of a popu- lation have similar bearing on all divisions of their life. The inven- tion of the spinning jenny or the printing press has moral and political as well as economic consequences. Imitation is as potent</page><page sequence="10">298 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY in shaping religious rites as in determining the pronunciation of words. Tastes for art and games radiate just as moral sentiments do. Suggestion, imitation, and sympathetic radiation, whether in the political, economic, religious, artistic, linguistic, or ethical realm, depend for growth or decline of their efficiency upon com- petition between the prestige of the venerable and prestige of the novel, prestige of the mob and prestige of the elite, and prestige of half a score of types familiar to the sociologist. Social elements of every sort adjust themselves to the pre-existing social order or reconstruct it according to the same recognized methods of assimi- lation and accommodation and survive or disappear by virtue of the same selective and eliminating agencies. There are fickle fashions in religion, popular science, language, morals, and politics as well as in dress and furniture. The stubbornness of unreasoning custom is explicable by the same analysis in one of these fields as in another. And if in one of these fields there is more of custom and in another more of fashion and in another more of rational institution, these differences are problems for explanation and exhibit variations in the application of constant principles that hold good for all social phenomenia. If geography develops "social geography" until the condition- ing relations of natural physical environment to social life are thoroughly explored; if psychology develops social psychology until it brings within its purview prevalent opinions, social valua- tions-economic, aesthetic, and ethical-and such typical social concretes as fashions, customs, and institutions and analyzes them into their essential and characteristic psychic elements, and traces in detail the types of conditioning relations between the activities of associates; if economics becomes more psychological as well as more historical and if it extends the study of consumption so far as to observe the social effects of the different forms, amounts, and distribution of wealth; if political science also becomes far more psychological and adequately studies the rise and play of interests which is the soul of political movements and studies the correlation between political opinions, sentiments, and activities and all the other elements in social life; if history avails itself of the results achieved by the completer social psychology and social</page><page sequence="11">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 299 geography as well as those of physical anthropology; and if each of these social sciences observes how far the very types of conditioning which operate within its field of inquiry operate in all the others, then it may be that all the things of which sociologists feel the need will have been done, except one, and there will remain no task for soci- ology, except the task of a scientific, as contrasted with a merely speculative, ethics. There will still be as real a need of ethics as of economics or of political science or of history, and by that time all of the enlightened world will realize that the ethics needed must be a study of objective reality-of the facts of social life. By the time that sociology can be ethics and nothing else every social scientist will have become a sociologist; that is to say, he will be on guard against the perversion or inadequacy in his descrip- tions that might result from the narrowing kind of specialization, and he will take account of those general principles of analysis and explanation which apply to all social realities. For the present sociology aims, first, to develop and emphasize those essential principles of description and explanation wllich are common to all the subdivisions of social reality but which students engrossed with the special aspects of a single subdivision of social reality have largely overlooked, though they are essential to the explanation of every social reality, economic, political, ethical, religious, artistic, or linguistic; and, second, sociology aims to extend the scientific spirit to that particular division of social reality which is the field of ethics. Thus sociology, in its more fundamental or scientific aspect, deals with two classes of problems: one general, a search for those principles of explanation and evolution which apply to all divisions of social life; the other specific and applying only to ethics. Speak- ing figuratively of these two classes of problems we may say that the first relates to the terminus ab quo and the second to the terminus ad quem of the life man lives in society. The first, in other words, asks how are the social realities caused, the second, in what good or evil do they issue. Adequate study of either of these two sets of problems involves the other. Description of human life for pur- poses of causal explanation would leave out the most distinctive facts if it omitted reference to good and evil, joy and pain, as features</page><page sequence="12">300 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY in the description; and ethics, the specific study of good and evil, becomes scientific only as a result of knowledge concerning the causation of good and evil. The fundamental problem of ethics: "What is good?" can be answered only by an inductive study of actual human experience. The other fundamental question: "What is right?" can be answered only by investigation of the effects of different forms of social conduct on human experience. The supplementary question: "'What is the natdre and origin of the different moral codes ? ' is wholly a problem in social evolution. The study of ethics here discussed is neither sentiment nor a priori speculation. It is a matter-of-fact research. Nothing here contained is intended to voice the absurd claim that sociologists are more ethical than other men, nor to admit the imputation that sociologists are more sentimental than other scientists. What is meant is this: that sociologists are to study human life in its broadest and most fundamental aspects, and that the facts per- taining to human life contain the only satisfactory answers to the problems of ethics. One by one the sciences have goine over from the realm of preknowledge, the realm of philosophy and meta- physics in the bad a priori sense, to the realm of philosophy in the good sense of ever-widening interpretative correlation of facts. Before the beginning of the intellectual movement, which is iden- tified with the names of Comte and Spencer, the study of human life, most of all in its religious and ethical aspects, had been mainly ot the bad a priori kind. The work of Comte was the great originalt protest against the assumption that the philosopher had no need of facts beyond those which chanced to come within the compass of his knowledge. The work of Spencer, tentative and largely erroneous as it was, at least set the example of reliance upon an extensive and carefully gathered body of facts about the life of people in every continent and in every stage of progress. Spencer2 further pointed out that thought about human life does not escape from perverting "biases " without the most deter- I "Original" is a relative term, as "great" is. 2 The Study of Sociology, chaps. viii-xii; cf. also P. G. Hammerton, The Intellectual Life, Part II, Letter 3, on "The Supreme Virtue for the Intellectual Life."</page><page sequence="13">SOCIOLOGY AS ETHICS 30I mined loyalty to facts. Until men derive their views of life from wide knowledge of facts, as a rule they cannot do otherwise than adopt such notions as are furnished by the groups to which they belong and as suit their own bent and interest. The result of this is the antithesis of scientific. The bias that has most seriously and most constantly perverted thought about life is not one of those which Spencer specifically enumerates. It is bias in favor of the thinker's adopted life-policy. Life itself is guided by thoughts about life. We depend not only for guidance but also for motive and power upon a few concepts and valuations. These are our most indispensable practical posses- sions. Moreover, the serious and right-minded person prizes his world-view not alone for the sake of the guidance, motive, and sense of worth which it gives to his own life; he prizes it also as being equally important to society. A man can more easily see any other ideas called in question than those which compose his world-view or life-policy. As to whether light is a substance or a mode of motion, he has no prefer- ence to outweigh his desire to know the truth. He might even bear to find that his political party was in the wrong and its tradi- tional opponent in the right, or that his section or country had been guilty of bigotry and misguided zeal, but he clings to his world- view. It is the foundation upon which his life and being are built. His eyes cannot see nor his mind appraise facts that call it in ques- tion, unless indeed he has an honesty and courage that outride any tempest of doubt and despair. But although all serious-minded men may equally cherish the different opinions that form the foundations of their life-policies, yet not all have been equally right in these opinions. Men can live and even live nobly by a false theory and may be willing nobly to die for it. A theory that is incongruous with facts is a per- ilous basis on which to found our valuations and our purposes- a foundation likely at any moment to be destroyed and to leave the believer bereft and engulfed. To attack either the general causal problems or the specific ethical problems of life in a scientific spirit threatens the world- view of most persons. To attack the problems of the causation of</page><page sequence="14">302 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY human life implies that life is part of the realm of cause and effect instead of belonging to a separate realm of "freedom" lying out- side the otherwise universal nexus of causation. And the adopted conceptions of freedom and responsibility must be called in question and perhaps reformulated or even abandoned, as the results of investigation may determine. At this point is illustrated the truth that the intellectual move- ment called sociology may produce significant results, not only in so far as it brings to light new facts or recondite principles, but by merely looking at familiar facts in a scientific spirit, for we have winced from viewing many of the most familiar facts of life in that open-minded way. If the principles of causation or conditioning which apply to individual and social life should prove in their main outline to be rather simple and obvious as soon as we are willing to look for them, yet to learn to look at them as true principles of causation and to adjust our system of thought and action accord- ingly may be both theoretically and practically one of the most momentous of all results of the scientific spirit and method. If investigation of sociology's general problem, the problem of social causation, seems to threaten destruction of the accepted world-view, there already is promise that investigation of the special problems of ethics by the sociological method will prove to be reconstructive of a modified world-view not less adapted to afford guidance, motive, and worth to life, and having the incal- culable advantage over the old world-view of being impregnable to any attacks by incongruous facts, and requiring no blinking of the clear eyes of intellectual honesty.</page></plain_text>
