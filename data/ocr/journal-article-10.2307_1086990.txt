HORACE, Odes I, 10 THE inauguration of the fourteenth modern Olympiad stirs the classicist with a peculiar, perhaps incredulous, interest. Is it possible that the recurring popular phenomenon in some degree substantiates his oft-repeated and half-believed contention about the persistence of Hellenic tradition in western culture? At least since the "Battle of Shepherd's Bush" in 1908, one school of thought has repudiated any connection between culture and the modern Olympics and argued that, instead of promoting friendship and sports- manship, the Games encourage only ill-will and professionalism. The argument is amply documented in a penteteric cycle of journalistic articles which appear as regularly as the Games themselves. "The wisest counsel that could be given is that the Olympic Games should never be held again" decided Blackwood's Magazine' in 1912, and this year the Cosmopolitan2 urged, "Let's Ditch the Olympics." For their crusade against the Games in 1936 in Berlin, the Nation,3 the Christian Century,4 and the Commonweal5 had a far better reason in the racial and religious prejudices which controlled the selection of German con- testants. But the laurels of Jesse Owens were a better answer than American abstention to the Nordic myth, and the partisans of pure sport have done more to advance their ideal by diplomatic participation than by sulky isolation. At any rate the Games have continued and grown in popular favour, and in the opinion of those who are best qualified to judge, they "do provide a sort of international rivalry that is sane and healthy and desirable . . . an intercourse that will help, slightly perhaps, but still perceptibly help in breaking up the absurd fabric of routine thinking on which the present system of international relations rests."' Even the sanguine ardour of the early revivalists, whose motives were genuinely inspired by the best traditions of the Panhellenic festival, was 'Vol. 192 (August, 1912), 252-55. 2March, 1948. 3August 21, October 16, 23, 30, 1935; July 18, August 1, 15, 1936. 4August 7, 14, 28; December 18, 1935. 5August 9, 1935.

Paul Shorey foresaw the futile struggles of the amateur smothered in the professional's pythonlike em- brace. To the python-slaying labours of Avery Brundage his vision did not extend.7 He pointed to the modern absence of any religious sanc- tion such as that which must largely have accounted for the integrity of the ancient Games. He concluded that the demands of modern life made it impossible ever again for the leaders of men to contemplate an athletic contest with the emotions of Greeks who "spent the best days of their youth in the gymnasium and often made it the principal centre of their social and intellectual life in maturer years."' With similar sentiments Gilbert Murray made the principle retroactive to the fifth century B.C. when the main stream of Hellenic life had already swept past the aristocrats for whom Pindar spoke, and found in Euripides the authoritative exegete of the new flood of intellectual life.' With Euri- pides' well-known criticism of athleticism he naturally agreed. With the unbelief of ephemeral journalists and great Hellenists it seems hard to reconcile the vitality either of the ancient or of the modern Games. It remains a fact that the ancient Olympic Games continued with many vicissitudes, but still in unbroken series from 776 B.C. to 394 A.D., even though rival military powers fought to control them and preside over them, and even though great thinkers fervently denounced them. The continuity of the modern Games has been twice broken by world wars, but they re-emerge unquenched by any deluge of pessimism or recrimination. Physical competition is no doubt a natural and ineradicable human instinct. There are those who hold that this is also true of war, and who can say that history has so far proved them wrong? But idealists will perhaps never cease trying to eradicate war, or at least to control it. Such an attempt, indeed, was included among the motives of those responsible for the modern revival of the Olympics. If lesser things may be compared with greater, it seems reasonable to suggest that the Olympic organization has for its existence a justification somewhat similar to the faith and hope which justified the former League of Nations and which justifies the present United Nations organization. If none of these three has attained its full objective, they should not on that account be either abolished or abandoned. Whatever may be said of war, gymnastic competition is wholesome as well as natural, and should therefore be both encouraged and con- trolled. On this point the criticism of Aristophanes'o is fundamentally sounder than that of Euripides, since the net contribution of athletics to education is beneficial rather than harmful.

Will they fight against the foe with discuses in their hands. .. ?12 Aristophanes,'3 on the contrary, was convinced that Marathon had been won in the palaestra, though his exposition of the rationale of physical education is by no means so clear or eloquent as that of Lucian, the Syrian. "Those in whom the Hellenic spirit is an acquisition," as Shorey well remarks, "feel the need of a greater explicitness" than the Greeks of the great age, who were content to suggest the meaning of their institutions with delicate, unobtrusive irony as in the passage where Herodotus describes the astonishment of Xerxes when he learns of the hardship and effort endured by his fearless Spartan foes for a crown of wild olive, the trivial meed of victory at the Olympic Games. Lucian has left us few passages finer than his tribute to the olive wreath as a symbol of that other priceless, but intangible, crown woven of individual freedom, political independence, security of dear ones, complete human happiness and all the choicest boons a man may ask of Heaven; and these things are provided, he avers, by the contest for which gymnastic training is the preparation.'4 To the uncomprehending Scythian in Lucian's dialogue, Solon explains with unruffled Socratic pains that the standard exercises of the palaestra are the best prelimin- aries for training in arms, that they develop hardihood, endurance, and self-control with the least expenditure of human life. He expounds the physical paradox that muscular effort increases and does not diminish bodily strength. He defends the conventional nudity as a means of insuring that no slothful athlete can conceal any physical defect. He praises gymnastic as a builder of character as well as of physique, for it wisely employs the surplus energy and leisure of the adolescent and affords salutary satisfaction to his youthful ambition. The systematic regimen so elaborately rationalized is shown to be not only an essential and integral part of education and therefore of the national constitution, but also for that reason both the guarantee that the constitution will endure, and a principal concern of the lawgiver. The great Panhellenic festivals with their coveted crowns, by exploiting the spirit of competi- tion, provide the most powerful incentive for the encouragement of gymnastic training everywhere in Greece. Lucian fails to tell us that winners of the olive crown received more material and more substantial rewards on their return to Athens. His "E. N.

The usual temptations of fame and gain led to the inevitable degeneration of amateurism into professionalism in Greece as elsewhere. The Periodo- neikes eventually appeared who had conquered in each of the four Panhellenic festivals.'9 Theagenes of Thasos is said to have won 1,400 prizes and to have achieved a posthumous semi-divinity.20 Competitors occasionally sold their services and bribed their opponents to lose, as is proved by the row of bronze statues of Zeus at Olympia set up from the proceeds of fines. Such blemishes form the unvaried grist of satirists and pessimists, who, like the mills of the gods, grind them exceeding fine. But Lucian, more commonly the satirist, is here the serious idealist; his eulogy of the educational value of athletics is singularly competent and complete. If the popular and almost universal Hellenic practice of gymnastic became a distinctive and inseparable department of Greek education, it exerted a no less profound and revolutionary influence upon Greek art, as shown both by the extant sculpture of the fifth century and the far more ample evidence of Athenian vase painting. In 1883, Sir Charles Waldstein could assert with confidence that it was the ultimate source of the aesthetic standards of his day.2' More recent artistic taste has sometimes preferred the archaic korai of the Acropolis, which, beautiful as they undoubtedly are, were not more completely buried in the foundations of fifth century construction than they were forgotten by the new school which produced Myron and Pheidias and Praxiteles. And if modern critics have wondered what marbles could be attributed to Pheidias' own chisel, Dio Chrysostom had little uncertainty about the sentiments which he might place in Pheidias' mouth. Using that rhetorical device, he made the friend of Pericles declare to his Panhellenic audience at Olympia in 97 A.D. that gods are most appropriately figured in human form.22 If we agree to his premise that the sculptor's aim was 15Plutarch, Solon, 23. 16Plato, Apology, 36 D.

But whatever we may think of Pheidias and his gods, there can be no doubt that Myron and Polycleitus interpreted the spirit of their age, and that their statuary was inspired by the prestige of the athlete. In more practical terms, athletics provided a demand as well as an inspiration for the sculptor. The victor was not slow to exercise his right to dedicate a statue in commemoration of his victory. Yet into the forest of bronze which soon sprang up at Olympia and other centres, realism was slow to penetrate. Portrait statues were dedicated at Olympia only by those who had conquered three times. Professionalism brought realism in its train, but idealism in Greek art was strongly defended by a native instinct for beauty.24 At Athens the demand for prize amphorae at the Panathenaea accounts for an extensive series of athletic motifs in vase painting, but so far from being limited to prize vases, the motif trans- forms into athletes the figures of mythology. For Canadians a special interest attached to the reappearance of the tradition in the notable sculpture of the late Dr. Tait McKenzie, so long distinguished for his equal interest in athletic art and in the promotion of physical education. A representative gem from his work is the exquisite medal which he designed for the victors at Stockholm in 1912.25 Profound and far-reaching as was the influence of the physical culture of the Greeks upon their plastic and pictorial art, it bred still greater offspring in the field of literature; and though the effect upon art was more lasting, the few extant copies of their masterpieces of sculpture cannot compare with the surviving body of their choric poetry. The Discobolus, Doryphorus, and Apoxyomenus are better known, but they pale before the majesty of Simonides, Bacchylides, and Pindar. The celebrity of these poets renders comment unnecessary, though it cannot redeem them from obscurity. The adequate rendering of a great epinician ode must have been scarcely less impressive than the recital of an Homeric rhapsodist or the performance of an Athenian drama. Not even apotheosis could have conferred more lasting immortality upon the victor whose name is enshrined in an ode of Pindar. His encomium upon an ancient boxer furnishes an interesting perspective in which to contemplate American idolatry of baseball or football stars. The epinician ode, magnificent poetry as it is, is almost a literary curios- ity. It was peculiarly the product of the Greek athletic festival and the aristocratic society which patronized court poets. The festivals con- tinued to be celebrated but odes ceased to be written. Another literary genre arose which also derived its name from such national assemblies. 23Pliny, N.H. 34. 16. 24Hyde, Olympic Victor Monuments, 57. 5R.

The popular story of Hero- dotus reading his histories in the hearing of Thucydides at Olympia can doubtless not be credited, but there is little doubt that his leit-motif of Panhellenism was also the principal theme of the panegyrists. "Hel- lenic nationality, as a tie no less real than local citizenship, the Hellenic cause as paramount to all individual interests, must, in one form or another," as Jebb26 remarks, "have always been the foremost topic of speakers at the Panhellenic festivals." We know it to have been pre- eminently the theme of "that old man eloquent"; we have the word of Philostratus that it was the theme of Gorgias, the counsellor of concord; and the fragmentary exordium of Lysias27 provides us with perhaps our earliest epideictic homily on the text that friendship was a recognized objective of the Games. Laudable, though little heeded as propaganda, the idea did have some slight basis in reality. Pilgrims to and from the Panhellenic sanctuary enjoyed the inviolable protection of the Olympic truce from the time that the sacred heralds went forth to proclaim the festival to all Hellas. Even Philip of Macedon apologized and made restitution when his mercenaries molested and robbed an Athenian on his way to Olympia.28 The pacific tendency of the original Games, which afforded oppor- tunity and inspiration to the ancient panegyrists, appealed strongly to the imagination of the modern revivalists. The modern Olympic Idea has found no better exponent than the late Professor W. M. Sloane, first American representative to the International Olympic Committee, who defined its purpose as "first to create and strengthen bonds of friendship, such as ought to exist, among all civilized nations, by frequent peaceful intercourse; secondly, to purify sport, abolish selfish and under- hand methods in the struggle for athletic supremacy, secure fair play for all, even the weakest, and as far as possible, make the contest, and not the victory, the joy of the young.""2 The first of these objectives, so attractive in its promise, has perhaps not been so barren of achievement as the derisive cynics would have us believe. Disputes over rulings, allegations of bias, threats of boycott, which might have been expected to kill the Games have in fact resulted in better organization and control. A comparison of the preparations in London in 1948 with those of 1908 is enough to prove the point. Even the disagreements of sportsmen are subject to the principle aman- tium irae amoris integratriost. The residual sanity of a democratic people is revealed in a recent announcement of the Canadian Institute of 26The Attic Orators (London, 1876), I. 203-4. 27XXXIIm. 2. 28Demosthenes, De falsa legatione, Hypoth., 335. 29"The Olympic Idea, Its Origins, Foundations and Progress" (The Century Maga- zine, 84, 1912, 408-14).</page><page sequence="7">OLYMPICS OLD AND NEW 37 Public Opinion that 56 per cent of Canadians believe that the Olympic Games do more good than harm. Their benefit will increase as the competitors learn to compete more in the spirit enunciated by him who inspired the revival: "L'important aux Jeux Olympiques n'est pas gagner, mais y prendre part, l'essential n'est pas conqubrir, mais bien lutter." A special situation arises when a national government attempts to exploit the Games for political purposes. Kraft durch Freude sounds like a good motto, but the Games at Berlin in 1936 neither showed the superiority of Nazi strength nor added greatly to the Nazi joy. The much publicized union of modern Olympism and the Japanese spirit of Bushido, which did not come to the test in 1940, would probably have proved an equally unstable compound. Modern exploitation has been easier to attempt when the Games have been held in national capitals, but it has been no more successful than when Dionysius of Syracuse in 388 B.C. tried to use the Panhellenic sanctuary for the same purpose, and provoked Lysias into his exhibition of Attic parrhesia. You cannot fool all the athletes all the time. Friendship and goodwill were anticipated as most desirable by- products of the modern Olympics, but the germ of the movement is to be found in the second rather than in the first of the objectives stated by Professor Sloane. The idea was born in the mind of a French nobleman and educator "whose heartstrings had been wrung by the humiliation of his country in 1870,"30 and who sought a cure for the physical and moral decadence of a nation "on the playing fields of Eton" and in the pursuit of manly sport which he recognized as a distinctive feature of British public schools, and which he believed to be the key to British greatness. Almost pathetic is the emphasis with which he repeatedly defers to Anglo-American eminence in the world of sport: "Anglo-Saxons have some trouble in getting used to the idea that other nations can devote themselves to athleticism, and that successfully."31 His own persistent efforts to arouse his countrymen, and, indeed, the continent of Europe, to the importance of physical education met with singular success. After repeated visits to Britain and the United States and the publication of several books both on the educational institutions of those countries and on the psychology of sport, he convened at the Sorbonne in Paris in June, 1894, an international congress, "the object of which was first and above all else, to define and promulgate a purpose, until then rather vague; secondly in the fulness of time to revive the Olympic contests."32 This modern De Tocqueville, as Albert Shaw called him, was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder and great apostle of the modern Olympic Idea.

Before his death in 1937, he lived to see the Games held ten times, and in eight different countries, beginning appropriately with that classic land from which he borrowed both the idea and the name. The burial of his heart in the stadium at Olympia in 1938, in accordance with his wish, was a symbolic confession of his belief in the Hellenic origin of his inspiration, but he had made it clear from the beginning that each Olympiad should be celebrated in a different city of the world, to secure more general interest and greater variety of aspect.33 The flattering concourse of distinguished competitors and visitors to the comparatively remote and backward Athens of 1896 so impressed the previously reluctant Greeks that they forthwith decided to claim the venue of all future Games. Their insistence eventually secured the concession of an interim meet in Athens in 1906, which was not repeated and which has never been ranked as a regular member of the series, which properly follows a four-year sequence. For Canadians, however, the extra and irregular Games of 1906 will always retain a special interest because of the Marathon victory of William Sherring of Hamilton. Baron de Coubertin's chief motive was to unify and purify athletics as the "corner stone of progress and health for the youth of our day."34 He "saw the necessity for re-establishing the Olympic Games as a supreme consecration of the cult of athletics practised in the purest spirit of true sport, proudly, joyfully and loyally."35 It was far from his intention to found just another series of contests for world championships. The principle of competition he recognized as a dominant and necessary motive, but the Olympic Games were to stand for "something else" and it was the "something else" that mattered. In the sanctity of the festival and the precinct, in their awe for the cult of Zeus, the ancient Greeks had a regulator, a counterpoise to the unbridled spirit of com- petition. If the modern Games were to exercise the influence he desired, they must in their turn show beauty and inspire reverence. As a substi- tute for the unifying worship of Olympian Zeus he could offer only the divisive spirit of patriotism. But for the beauty of the Altis, he proposed a modern marriage of the Arts and the Sports.36 In 1906 the Inter- national Olympic Committee summoned to the Com6die Frangaise in Paris a conference to discuss the best means for drawing together Sports, Arts and Letters. In the same year Paris heard an oratorio entitled Ludus Pro Patria by Augusta Holmes37 which gave artistic expression to the spirit and the motto of Baron de Coubertin.

The con- ference at Paris resolved that in future five competitions should be added to the usual athletic events, and that these should be in architec- ture, painting, music, sculpture, and literature.38 These departments continue to be recognized as integral parts of the Olympic contests, though they draw less attention from the vulgus profanum than does physical prowess. It was probably not much differ- ent at Olympia. But why, asks Tait McKenzie, has the modern athlete received so little attention from the painter and sculptor? "Sculpture is the medium peculiarly suited to portray athletic action . . . and nothing is more beautiful than the figure in the flower of its youth, showing its strength, grace and agility in the sports and games ... The nude or near-nude requires no cultivation in America. It is taken for granted at the beaches and camps from Maine to Florida, as a con- sultation of magazines will clearly recall."39 But the modern obsession seems to be with the female figure. Enough has been said perhaps to show not only that those most active in the promotion of the modern Games were influenced strongly by their impressions of classical Olympia, but, what is more to the point, that the practice and problems of modern athletics is paralleled in almost every phase by the experience of the ancient Greeks. The chief differ- ence, as Shorey noted, is that the average citizen is less active in this field to-day than he was in ancient Greece. Military exigencies may point the way to a remedy; Baron de Coubertin will then have been justified. 38Sloane, "The Olympic Idea." 39McKenzie, "The Athlete in Sculpture."</page></plain_text>
