<plain_text><page sequence="1">La Notion de Corpuscles et d'atomes. By Prof. Langevin. (Hermann &amp; Co., Paris.) With the ever-increasing isotopes, the neutron and the positron, to say nothing of the now old electron, proton and photon, our knowledge of the constitution of matter is extending both intensively and extensively at such a rapid pace that it is quite a job for anybody to keep in view, if not in touch, with modern progress in all its details. It is hence a signal service which Prof. Langevin has done in his address on ' La Notion de Corpuscles et d'atomes ' published by Hermann et cie, Paris, as Report No. 132 in the well-known series " Actualit√©s Scienti fiques et industrielles " 1931 (price 12 fr.). Prof. Langevin has started at the very beginning so that even a Rip Van Winkle in science cannot complain of any links missing in the chain of progress. He begins with the Democritian doctrine of the divisibility of matter and the existence of ultimate particles and pays a tribute to chemists for having followed up the idea and placed it on a quantitative basis in their elucidation of molecular and atomic weights. Both these quantities are, however, only comparative values and it is due to the more exact sister science that an accurate know ledge of Avogadro's number was possible and thence an absolute value for those quantities. The next step in the progress came with the advent of the cathode tube in the last quarter of the last century and with it the idea of corpuscles. A brief but coherent account is given of J. J. Thomson's experiments for establishing the electron as a definite physical entity, of Lorentz's theoretical conception of an elec trified granular structure of matter for explaining certain optical phenomena on the electromagnetic theory and Wilson's cloud chamber methods of, as it were, visualising the electron. He explains how photographs taken by the cloud chamber methods were used to verify the photoelec tric law on the equivalence of energy exchange between matter and radiation, a verification which led on to the conception</page><page sequence="2">September 1934] CURRENT SCIENCE ix of a structure of radiation, a ground already prepared by Planck, Einstein and others in their discussions on the emission and absorption of radiation by matter, the spectral character of blackbody radiation and the inertia of energy. Mention is also made of Compton effect as experimentally confirming the corpuscular conception of both matter and radiation. Rutherford's experiments on radioactivity and the disintegration of matter leading on to the conception of the proton and the nuclear atom model are described with suitable photographs taken by the cloud chamber method. Finally, the experiments of Bothe and Becker and the discussions thereon of Chadwick and others leading to the discovery of the neutron and the positron a,re explain ed in an interesting manner. Thus in a brief but very illuminating review Prof. Langevin lias brought out our modern corpuscular conception of the universe as consisting of electrons, protons, neutrons and positrons on the material side and photons on the energy side, the two sides, however, being mutually convertible. Having thus summarised the present experimental knowledge on the structure o,fr matter, Prof. Langevin proceeds to review the situation from the theoretical viewpoint. After a brief reference to the classical electromagnetic theory and its limitations when applied to the dynamic atom, the introduction of Planck's quantum conditions in the mechanics of the Rutherford-Bohr atom model, Prof. Sommerfeld's exhaustive and successful treatment of the hydrogen atom and its limitations when applied to atoms with several electrons, mention is just made of the development on the one hand of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, Born and Jordon and on the other hand of wave mechanics by Louis de Broglie, Schro dinger and Dirac. Prof. Langevin gives a clear though very brief account of the train of thought that led on to the wave concep tion of matter, mentioning the experiments of Davisson and Germer and G. P. Thomson. This brings him on to the greatest pitfall of all in modern science, viz., the dual con ception of the electron, corpuscular at times and undulatory at other times. The dual nature of the electron has been the two horns of a dilemma between which, not being able to choose one and exclude the other, scientists have been trying to strike a compromise. Bohr calls the two aspects complementary and has enunciated his principle of complementarity. Born, in trying to reconcile the two ideas, introduces a statistical character in the discussion which, however, destroys the objectivity of electrons, protons and photons. Heisenberg has, at this stage, introduced his Principle of Indeterminacy according to which it is not possible to know at once the position and momentum of an electron. Prof. Langevin taking up the method of Born suggests a return to a statistical treatment. Knowing that the Boltzmann Gibbs statistics has failed to agree with experiment, he suggests the applications of the Bose-Einstein and the Pauli-Fermi statistics with the Pauli's exclusion principle thrown in when dealing with charges. Mention is made of the successful applica tion of this method by Bose, Debye, Jeans and others. Prof. Langevin l^&amp;cludes with a moral disquisition on the effect of long habit on the anthropomorphic tendency of our minds in finding an object moie easy to deal with than an idea. He makes a very interesting observation that the original conception of an object should have been as abstract as our present conception of an idea and just as in course of time we have familiarised ourselves with dealing with objects, we should begin now to deal in the abstract with conceptions and bequeath this habit as a convenient heredity to our posterity.
