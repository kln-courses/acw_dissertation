<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Most Reluctant Convert: C. S . Lewis's Journey to Faith. By David C. Down- ing. Downers Grove (IL): InterVarsity Press, 2002. ISBN 0-8308-231 1-5. Pp.191. $16.00. Conversion, wrote Evelyn Waugh, is like stepping "out of a Looking-Glass world, where everything is an absurd caricature, into the real world God made; and then be- gins the delicious process of exploring it limitlessly." Waugh was only one of numer- ous twentieth-century British intellectuals who moved through what they deemed modernity's distorting hall of mirrors on their way to discovering what they saw as a true reflection of reality in the household of Christian faith, and whose pilgrimages inaugurated explorations of traditional orthodoxy that defied prevalent post-Christian pressures. Arguably the most influential of these literary converts was C. S. Lewis (1898- 1963), whose books still sell over six million copies annually and whose legacy is front- page news in The New York Times. Several shelves can be stocked with studies of Lewis's life and corpus, but, surprisingly, there has hitherto been no systematic account of his spiritual sojourn. David C. Downing seeks to fill this lacuna with his presentation and analysis of Lewis's religious opinions, ranging from his childhood Protestantism through an adolescent loss of faith and an early- adult quest for a coherent view of Being, which ended in an initially grudging acceptance of orthodoxy by "'the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England'" (137). Coming from a sapient Lewis scholar, Downing's narrative is precise and rounded; it also contains many intelligent insights into Lewis's work. Although the study would have benefited from more intellectual and historical contextualization of Lewis's journey, it is still of considerable worth to Lewis critics and of use to all scholars of modern Christian thought. While Downing relies heavily on Lewis's autobiography Surprised by Joy , he (un- like many Lewis biographers) also attends to gaps in that self-narrative, focusing par- ticularly on the development of Lewis's mind and soul during his teens and twenties. Downing thereby underscores the gradual nature of Lewis's conversion and the conti- nuity of crucial themes in his thought. Above all, Downing argues rightly, Lewis's spir- itual life was shaped by early and recurrent experiences of Sehnsucht or "joy," a long- ing for the ineffable whose insufficient satisfaction was richer than the quenching of</page><page sequence="2">108 Book Reviews any other desire. Lewis's attempts to comprehend these transient apprehensions of the transcendent, though, also entailed confronting a conflict in his mind between an imag- ination that fed deeply on these eternal irruptions and an equally powerful reason that questioned the veracity of such timeless moments. It would take Lewis nearly three decades to find the fulfillment of his yearning in theism and the resolution of his mental tension in sacramental Christianity. Lewis had a Protestant upbringing in Belfast, but even in youth he regarded this heritage as an unsatisfactory Puritan ethic without a Puritan theological basis. When dispatched at age nine to Wynyard boarding school in England, he encountered a sim- ilarly severe legalism. Lewis conceded that Wynyard's strict ethos at least arose from genuine Christian faith, but he still found it spiritually stifling and inadequate to the suffering he was undergoing at this soon-to-be-defunct school in the wake of his moth- er's death, which had occurred shortly before he matriculated. Lewis's rebellion against the scrupulosity fostered by Wynyard's religious atmosphere helped prompt a lifelong disdain for introspection. More immediately, he sought relief from this oppressively arid form of faith, which he now seemed to consider typical of Christianity. At age twelve he entered Cherbourg House, a preparatory school for Malvern College, in Worcestershire. Under the sway of Cherbourg's motherly matron and his reading in the natural and social sciences (like comparative religion), Lewis settled into an indifferentism that eventually became athe- istic materialism. This bent was reinforced during two and a half years of private study with rationalist William Kirkpatrick in Surrey (which commenced when Lewis with- drew from Malvern at fifteen after a brief, unhappy tenure), Kirkpatrick being a devo- tee of Arthur Schopenhauer and James Frazier. At the same time Lewis began to ques- tion materialism's adequacy during these years. He always revered Kirkpatrick for giving him rigorously logical training, but he concluded that his teacher's radical skepticism was a faulty world view, especially as it entailed abandoning the search for "joy" as a sentimental illusion in favor of what seemed only a sneering, superficial cynicism. When Lewis went up to Oxford in 1917, then, he was ripe for a lapse into dualism. His service in the Great War in 1917-18 only heightened this susceptibility by reveal- ing the friability of all flesh. Lewis thus entered a Manichean phase, asserting an es- sential conflict between the realms of blessed spirit and imagination and of cursed matter and reason. According to Downing, Lewis's basically Romantic temperament precluded his persistence in such radical pessimism, and by the early 1920s he was in- vestigating spiritualism, which still stressed the primacy of the intangible but was more consoling, as it offered the assurance of an afterlife while not making the exacting in- tellectual and moral demands of orthodox Christianity. In 1923, however, Lewis was repulsed from spiritualism permanently when he witnessed the mental collapse of a close friend and practitioner of it. This incident intensified his distrust of introspec- tion and led him to focus on external reality as a vaccination against self-immured madness. Lewis now sought a way of finding truth in the world beyond himself without re- verting to Kirkpatrickean positivism. He thus started studying philosophical idealism intently, particularly the pantheistic brand professed by the "English Hegelians," espe- cially E H. Bradley. Lewis was impressed by this outlook's idea of an absolute spirit that was immanent in nature, for it seemed to harmonize spirit and matter, imagina- tion and reason. Looking for the "god within," however, could also precipitate the so- lipsistic introversion that Lewis loathed, making the theistic emphasis on a personal</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 109 Creator ultimately more enticing to him. By the summer of 1929 he had concluded that such an unmade Maker existed, and he made his reluctant confession of faith. Lewis was now convinced that this personal God was related to his experiences of "joy," but the disjunction in his mind between imagination and reason remained un- healed. Lewis had had some early exposure to sacramentalism through his repeated readings of George MacDonald s Phantases , which by 1923 were spurring him to consid- er whether the spiritual and material existed on a continuum rather than in opposi- tion to each other. Moreover, an early Oxford friend, Alfred Jenkin, had helped dis- suade Lewis from dualism by his enthusiastic search for essential truth within sense experience. In 1926 such speculations became concentrated in Lewis's contemplations of orthodox Christianity. A dedicated Oxford atheist, T. D. Weldon, confided to Lewis that "'all that stuff of Frazier's about the Dying God [. . .] looks as if it had really hap- pened once"' (147). Lewis received concurrent stimulus from G. K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man to see the Christian myth as an imaginatively appealing tale that could withstand the scrutiny of reason and history. He claimed later that this was the first book that traced the Christian outline of history in a way that made sense to him. The Everlasting Man s influence on Lewis merits more extensive treatment than Downing's cursory mention of it, since in this volume Chesterton deemed orthodox Christianity the unique integration of imagination and reason: it is "the reconciliation because it is the realization of both mythology and philosophy. It is a story and in that sense one of a hundred stories; only it is a true story. It is a philosophy and in that sense one of a hundred philosophies; only it is a philosophy like life." Nevertheless, Lewis was not fully persuaded by such arguments for five more years. On 19 September 1931 a late-night colloquy with two close Christian friends, Hugo Dyson and J. R. R. Tolkien, convinced him that Christianity fulfilled all the myths of anthropomorphic and sacrificial deities that he had long admired because the Incar- nation and Redemption actually transpired at specific, verifiable points in time. As Lewis would later write, "Myth became Fact" in the historicity of Christ. Whereas Lewis had previously tended to regard the reality revealed by reason as mostly grim and the goodness grasped by imagination as largely illusory, the Christian true myth was "both good and real. It was a faith grounded in history and one that satisfied even his formi- dable intellect" ( 148). In asserting the synergy of the numinous and the quotidian, then, sacramental Christianity gave Lewis complete religious and psychic reintegration, for "this view affirmed the functions of imagination and the intellect to be complement- ary, not competitive" (156). Nine days after this pivotal conversation, Lewis capped his pilgrim's progress by assenting with his will to Christ's claim to be the Incarnate God. As Downing elucidates this spiritual journey, he provides excellent close readings of various Lewis texts, including lesser-known juvenilia. He also plaits effectively the prominent issues in Lewis's conversion and their recurrence as tropes in his adult writ- ing, while showing at the same time how Lewis's mature works often present respons- es to his younger viewpoints. These analytical virtues arise from Downing's compre- hensive mastery of Lewis's œuvre. At times, however, his book would have benefited from a broader vision. For instance, like many scholars of intellectual converts, Down- ing pays little attention to the vast theoretical literature on the psychology and theolo- gy of conversion. Conversance with this research would have helped enrich and sys- tematize his discussions of key topics he addresses less methodically, such as the role of personal example in conversion and the dynamics of a convert's surrender to grace. Moreover, although Downing situates Lewis's attraction to spiritualism well within its</page><page sequence="4">110 Book Reviews cultural setting, more such historical contextualization (especially of Lewis's war ser- vice and its effects on his outlook) would have deepened understanding of Lewis as an actor in a specific milieu. Downing's study would also have profited from pertinent adversions to the pilgrimages of some of Lewis's convert peers who grappled with sim- ilar issues, reminding us that Lewis's individual journey was part of a larger social phe- nomenon. The Most Reluctant Convert: C. S. Lewis's Journey to Faith is nonetheless a volume of enduring value. Its intellectually rigorous and thorough recounting of the signal event in Lewis's life and its implications for his work both clarify his conversion and suggest fruitful lines of inquiry for future examinations. Although Lewis's faith was often scorned by his post-Christian colleagues, his struggle to transcend views that still enchanted them gave him the assurance he needed to persist in professing unpopular beliefs and persuading others to leave the looking-glass world of modern secularism for the real world redeemed by Myth become Fact. As his mentor Chesterton put it, After one moment when I bowed my head And the whole world turned over and came upright [ ] The sages have a hundred maps to give That trace their crawling cosmos like a tree, They rattle reason out through many a sieve That stores the sand and lets the dust go free: And all these things are less than dust to me Because my name is Lazarus and I live.
