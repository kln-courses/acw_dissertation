However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography  motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life  bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet  himself.”4 This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov,  made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death,  becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire and his  monumental endeavor of translation and critical commentary— Eugene Onegin—some twenty years later. In Pale Fire, John Shade,  the author of the eponymous poem, writes: “Man’s life as commentary  to abstruse / Unfinished poem. Note for further use.”5  Nabokov’s four-volume translation of Eugene Onegin was  published by the Bollingen Foundation in 1964 (a second revised  edition came out in 1975) and provoked a variety of reactions,  from disbelief (“the raised eyebrow, the sharp intake of breath”)6  and outrage, to admiration and appraisal. The parallels between  Pale Fire, written simultaneously with Nabokov’s work on the  Onegin translation and published in 1962, and Nabokov’s Onegin  (translation, Commentary, and Index) have attracted many Nabokov  scholars to the presence of “some kind of a link-and-bobolink”  between the two, to use the words of “Pale Fire” the Poem.7 Pale Fire  bears such a striking structural similarity to Nabokov’s Onegin that it  is easy to suggest self-parody. Nabokov worked on Pushkin’s verse  novel Eugene Onegin (1823-1831) from 1949 to 1957. In the published  four-volume edition, the translation took up 240 pages, while the  Commentary and Index ran to almost 1200. In what could have  been a comment on the motivations for Nabokov’s extraordinary  — 87 — </page> <page sequence="3"> C h a p t e r  2 endeavor of Onegin, Brian Boyd writes of Pale Fire: “Here the whole  situation of Kinbote and Shade—Kinbote’s desperation that Shade  tell his story in the verse he cannot write himself, his resolving to  tell it via a commentary to the poem when he finds Shade has not  obliged him—can only be fully told in the form Nabokov devises  for Pale Fire.”8 Pale Fire also can be viewed as Nabokov’s response to  the deficiencies of other translations of Eugene Onegin, which he had  criticized, as well as to the inequities involved in literary translation.9  Commentators and interpreters, much like Kinbote himself, are  too preoccupied with their own megalomaniac idiosyncrasies,  their own environment and tradition, their likes and dislikes, to  focus on those of the original they are dealing with.10 For the sake  of bringing the original closer to the target audience, or claiming  to “free” or “distill” the pure matter of the authorial intent of the  original, they “tell” somebody else’s story as they believe it should  be told or would have been, if only the original were written in the  target language. Similarly, Kinbote thinks he “enhances the poem  by revealing ‘the underside of the weave,’ the much more thrilling  story that he pressed Shade so often to tell, that Shade should have  told and would have told had he been free.”11  Nabokov’s translation of Eugene Onegin, especially seen in the  context of his major work of fiction, Pale Fire, raises an unexpected  question: was what is generally considered to be a radical change  in Nabokov’s views of literary translation really a change? On the  surface level it seems hard to deny the striking contrast between  Nabokov’s earlier translations of Fyodor Tiutchev, for example,  which he himself later would dub “adaptations,” to the unyielding  literal behemoth of Onegin, fascinating to study but barely possible  to read. I would like to suggest a different view: I believe that there  is evidence that Nabokov’s metaphysical vision defined his literary  translation all along, just as it defined his fiction. This vision is  the underpinning of all his literary endeavors and did not change  much throughout his literary career. With Onegin it was just coming  to fruition, to the moment of “crystallization.” What seems to be  a radical change in translation strategy is therefore not a change at all.  In other words, what changed was the way he deemed appropriate  to practice what were essentially the same theoretical postulates.  — 88 — </page> <page sequence="4"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” To paraphrase the famous statement by Carl von Clausewitz, this  would be “the continuation of policy by other means.” Praxis being  what it is, literal translation was basically the expression of the same  understanding by other means at other times. In what follows, I consider Nabokov’s metaphysics, linking  his novel Pale Fire, whose central focus is the process of translation  via appropriation of the original, to his translation of Pushkin’s  Eugene Onegin. The central premise on which this chapter hinges  is that translation for Nabokov was always a means for expressing  his profoundly held ideas about art. I argue that Nabokov’s  metaphysical uncertainty shapes the allegorical (metonymical)  mode of his writing, including translation (the discussion of the  metonymical and metaphorical modes continues in Chapter 3).  In this light, I look closely at how the Index and Commentary to  Nabokov’s Onegin function, how literalism is achieved, and the  criteria for its assessment. Nabokov’s Metaphysics The very Western reluctance to accept metaphysics as  being at the heart of all of Nabokov’s “stratagems” (his word)  is understandable. The fatigue and mistrust of metaphysics in  twentieth-century Western criticism, in contrast to the opposite  vision in Russian literary discourse, can be best illustrated by  a relatively recent anecdote. At a joint conference aimed at the  advancement of Russian-American cultural exchange, an American  poet and professor of humanities warmly praised his Russian  guests, representatives of a Moscow literary magazine, some of  them themselves poets, for their “courage” in addressing largely  metaphysical issues in their work. The Russian visitors exchanged  glances of incomprehension. Was it their English? What “courage”  was he talking about? What could be more natural than addressing  metaphysical issues? In the West, the un-ironic Almighty is not  exactly a frequent “visitor” of contemporary poetic creations,  often called “texts” rather than “poems.” Perhaps Russian literary  tradition conspired, as it were, with the very “irreality” of twentieth- century Russian history, premature political “post-modernism” with  — 89 — </page> <page sequence="5"> C h a p t e r  2 all its nebulous simulacra, and created the pre-disposition for the  opposite fatigue—fatigue of the so called “real,” while addressing  metaphysical issues became the most natural thing in the world.  The vantage point of the vast majority of Nabokov studies in  the West was of Nabokov as primarily a “metaliterary” writer.12   This reputation started to build rather early, when the writer was  still known as Sirin and his fellow Russian émigrés delighted in or  cringed at the sight of his unusual talent. His friend and contemporary  Vladislav Khodasevich contributed to it by perspicaciously  pointing to the role played by literary device in Nabokov’s fiction.  Nabokobv’s foes were upset by this preoccupation with form,  perceiving the ostensible lack of concern for grand social issues as  “un-Russianness.” His American/Western reputation made him  a “master of style,” a genius of artifice and intertextual play. As  his fame grew considerably after Lolita, Nabokov himself molded  his reputation by projecting his public persona through carefully  crafted interviews. Playfulness and mimicry, the two characteristics  most often evoked in connection to Nabokov’s art, applied to the  projected image of the “artist” himself. The undeniable fact is that  Nabokov, most likely intentionally, created intricate patterns and  coincidences without explicit interpretation. He allows them to be  read in diametrically opposite ways: either as “fatidic patterns”  (Vladimir Alexandrov’s term) or as the deliberate interpolation of  the text’s artificiality.  However, the evidence that Nabokov’s perceived artificiality  goes against the grain of his work has always existed in plain view.  It was explicitly stated in his poetry (especially his poem “Slava”  [”Fame”]) and his public pronouncements, including those in Strong  Opinions and Speak, Memory. There is also the blunt statement by Véra  Nabokov in the Foreword to the collection of Nabokov’s Russian  poetry in 1979, claiming potustoronnost—the “otherworldliness,” the  metaphysical “beyond”—as the main theme of her husband’s art, as  well as direct assertions in Nabokov’s own posthumous “The Art of  Literature and Commonsense.” Finally, the evidence is everywhere,  cumulatively, in Nabokov’s own fiction.  The critical approach started to change in the 1980s. One of the  early examples is W. W. Rowe’s Nabokov’s Spectral Dimension.13 The  — 90 — </page> <page sequence="6"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” book does a valuable service, as it assembles concrete evidence of  specters swarming in Nabokov’s fiction. However, it never goes  beyond the acknowledgement of specific ghosts, as it were, and the  situations in which they usually reveal their presence. Gennady  Barabtarlo’s and Alexandrov’s books reached beyond the specifics  and rightfully emphasized Nabokov’s metaphysics.14 Alexandrov  characterized Nabokov’s transcendental beliefs thus: “an intuition  about a transcendental realm of being.”15 Both Barabtarlo and  Alexandrov are Russians (albeit American professors), and it  might be tempting to dismiss their emphasis on metaphysics as a  natural Russian idiosyncrasy. Boyd’s excellent studies of Pale Fire  and Ada therefore should be credited for firmly placing Nabokov’s  metaphysics on the radar of the Western Nabokovian studies. One  cannot help feeling grateful to these scholars: no longer does one  need to spend time proving that Nabokov’s preoccupation with  metaphysical issues was profound—as asserted by the author  himself. For a concise summation of the “shape” in which the  metaphysical reveals itself, I would resort, as many before me, to  the much quoted “Fame” of Poems and Problems. It talks about a  “secret,” a motif evoked either vaguely or more or less explicitly in  many novels of Nabokov (Invitation to a Beheading, The Defense, and  The Gift, to name just a few): . . . I am happy that Conscience, the pimp of my sleepy reflections and projects,  did not get at the critical secret. Today   I am really remarkably happy.   That main secret tra-tá-ta tra-tá-ta tra-tá— and I must not be overexplicit;  this is why I find laughable the empty dream about readers, and body, and glory.  . . . I admit that the night has  been ciphered right well  but in place of the stars I put letters,  and I’ve read in myself how the self to transcend—  and I must not be overexplicit.  — 91 — </page> <page sequence="7"> C h a p t e r  2 Trusting not the enticements of the thoroughfare  or such dreams as the ages have hallowed,  I prefer to stay godless, with fetterless soul  in a world that is swarming with godheads.  But one day while disrupting the strata of sense and descending deep down to my wellspring  I saw mirrored, besides my own self and the world,  something else, something else, something else.16 The secret cannot be made explicit, and it is nothing new. Tiutchev  wrote in his famous “Silentium!” (1833): “An uttered thought  is a lie.”  On the other hand, on those occasions when Nabokov tries to  articulate the secret and convey the actual details of the afterlife,  his fiction suffers (Look at the Harlequins and Transparent Things).  Metaphysical secrets notwithstanding, Nabokov’s explicitly  expressed desire to stay “godless” testifies to the impossibility of  reducing this metaphysical “something else” to any conventionally  understood religion or spirituality. Nabokov squarely avoided  being placed with any and all religious denominations: “In my  metaphysics, I am a confirmed non-unionist and have no use for  organized tours through anthropomorphic paradises.”17 Nabokov’s  characters are on a quest for glimpses of that metaphysical “beyond.”  It is the central quest of Shade’s life in Pale Fire: Shade writes his  poem “projecting himself imaginatively beyond death. ...”18  As a rule however, Nabokov’s characters, including Shade, have to  admit their failure in such quests, though the quest is never without  gratification.  The “Source” of Pale Fire To tie in issues of metaphysics, fiction, and translation, I would  like to use the very title of Pale Fire as a symbolic springboard for  further investigation. As is well known, on the last day of writing  his poem and grappling for the appropriate title, Shade playfully  evokes Shakespeare’s Timon of Athens: “But this transparent thingum  — 92 — </page> <page sequence="8"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” does require / Some moondrop title. Help me, Will! Pale fire.”19  Shakespeare’s lines are: . . . . I’ll example you with thievery: The sun’s a thief, and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea; the moon’s an arrant thief, And her pale fire she snatches from the sun; The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears.20 As attentive readers, we know that despite the mysterious presence  of an edition of this play in Kinbote’s own life, he spectacularly  fails to identify the source of Shade’s title. Kinbote’s Commentary  on his uncle Conmal, a Zemblan translator of Shakespeare, quotes  the above passage in “re-translation” from Zemblan into English, in  which “pale fire” gets lost in translation.  Whether the Shakespearean title reflects Shade’s modesty or  wit—whether he claims that his light is pale only compared to the  source of Shakespeare (this interpretation would fit well with Shade’s  image of Shakespeare’s ghost being able to light up an entire town  in Shade’s poem “The Nature of Electricity”!) or he “wittily steals  from Timon’s denunciation against universal thievery”21—we still  have to acknowledge that not only Shade’s poem but also Kinbote’s  enterprise and Nabokov’s novel as a whole are called Pale Fire  (a new triad!). The echoes of “pale fire” are present, unbeknownst to  Shade, in his daughter Hazel’s investigation of the “roundlet of pale  light”22 in the Haunted Barn, spelling out a mysterious message that  the reader can decode while Kinbote cannot (he also misrecognizes  the ghost, thinking it is Shade’s friend Hentzner’s specter), and,  unnoticed by Kinbote, in his account of the “dim light” of his  teenage lover’s ghost in the tunnel to freedom during the Zemblan  revolution. Kinbote says that he “caught [himself] borrowing a kind  of opalescent light from my poet’s fiery orb. . . .”23  While Shakespeare might be a “fiery orb” to the “heroic  couplets”24 of Shade’s “Pale Fire,” the Poem in and of itself would  become this “fiery orb” to Kinbote’s Commentary. And Nabokov is  obviously the hidden source of “fire” to Pale Fire the novel. We are  — 93 — </page> <page sequence="9"> C h a p t e r  2 dealing with several stages of removal from the source of creation  described in terms of light. To confirm this, here is, interestingly, how  Kinbote describes “God’s presence”: “. . . a faint phosphorescence  at first, a pale light in the dimness of bodily life, and a dazzling  radiance after it.”25  The Shakespearean passage from Timon of Athens becomes an  allegory of writing/translation/commentary and stands ironically  as a scrambled version of a metaphysical ladder to the source of  light: “. . . To start with, he[man]’d find shadows the easiest things  to look at. After that, reflections—of people and other things—in  water. The things themselves would come later, and from those he  would move on to the heavenly bodies and the heavens themselves.  He’d find it easier to look at the light of the stars and the moon by  night than look at the sun, and the light of the sun, by day.”26 The  Shakespearean model, being circular rather than linear, would not  allow a simple Platonic solution to the metaphysical source of light,  but becomes sort of a “hall of mirrors,” much as Nabokov’s novels  themselves, always toying with the titillating possibility of one  solution, but never truly allowing for it. Examples of such moments  “on the verge of a simple solution of the universe”27 are abundant  in Nabokov’s fiction. The secret of the title is discovered on many  different levels in the novel (the ascension to each new level gives  a delightful feeling of jouissance to the reader), but the Shakespearean  source yields one more secret meaning and it applies not just to the  intricacies of the plot, nor even to the text as a whole, but to the  process of writing as translation on a metaphysical level, as well as  to translation/commentary as another degree of removal from the  same “source,” yet all the same partaking in it. In Strong Opinions, Nabokov described his understanding of  a “ladder” to the unknown dimension: “time without conscious- ness—lower animal world; time with consciousness—man; con- sciousness without time—still higher state.”28 Since Nabokov’s  metaphysics always goes hand in hand with his aesthetics, his  accounts of what he called, alternatively, “cosmic synchroniza- tion”29 and “inspiration” (in “The Art of Literature and Common- sense”)30 concern positioning an artist vis-à-vis time: “while the  scientist sees everything that happens in one point of space the  — 94 — </page> <page sequence="10"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” poet feels everything that happens in one point of time.”31 The mo- ment of epiphany or “fissure” in the “spherical prison” of time al- lows for an escape from “smug causality.”32 Jonathan Borden Sis- son observed that Nabokov’s notion of cosmic synchronization is  akin to T. S. Eliot’s and Ezra Pound’s “holistic experiences related  to the creation of poetry.”33 In Speak, Memory, inspiration, “in a sud- den flash,” brings together the past, present, and future, and in this  flash time stops existing.34 The initial jolt of inspiration is described  by Nabokov in his article “Inspiration” (1972) as “pale fire” of  sorts—a “prefatory glow.”35 The whole book is said to “be ready  ideally in some other, now transparent, now dimming, dimen-  sion. . . .”36 Over the years, Nabokov’s descriptions of his creative  process remained surprisingly stable. He went as far as to suggest  in a review that creative work is “conservation” rather than creation  of the “perfect something which already exists in the somewhere  which Professor Woodbridge [the author Nabokov is reviewing]  obligingly terms ‘Nature.’”37  Parallels to Platonic dialectic are, of course, inevitable, but  Nabokov always tried to protect himself from being associated with  any “big ideas”: “I am afraid to get mixed up with Plato, whom  I do not care for. . . .”38 In a jab at Nietzsche, Nabokov says he would  have not lasted long in Plato’s “Germanic regime of militarism and  music.”39 Instead, his is a peculiar kind of Platonism, a metaphysics  that comes to terms with Nietzschean repudiation of it. It is strongly  filtered through Nietzsche, just as the whole of Symbolist and  post-Symbolist Russian culture was. Nabokov was undoubtedly  the product of the Russian Silver Age, which he himself readily  admitted: “the ‘decline’ of Russian culture in 1905-1907 is a Soviet  invention . . . Blok, Bely, Bunin and others wrote their best stuff in  those days. And never was poetry so popular, not even in Pushkin’s  days. I am a product of that period, I was bred in that atmosphere.”40  From that same source (Silver Age and Nietzschean influence)  comes Nabokov’s distaste for “common sense”—the iron-clad laws  of cause and effect, as well as the identification of inspiration, or  cosmic synchronization, with the “spirit of free will that snaps its  rainbow fingers in the face of smug causality.”41 From that same  source comes also the incommunicability of the secret (the “truth”)  — 95 — </page> <page sequence="11"> C h a p t e r  2 I have mentioned earlier. In Nietzschean terms, the Dionysiac, as an  expression of the unconscious, can never arrive at the fully articulate  form either: “that striving toward infinity, that wing-beat of longing  even as we feel supreme delight in a clearly perceived reality, these  things indicate that in both these states of mind we are to recognize  a Dionysiac phenomenon.”42 The truth, in other words, cannot be  plainly stated.  To a certain degree, the Nabokovian metaphysical uncertainty  resembles most of all the controversial Nietzschean “primordial  unity” (Arthur Schopenhauer’s term), a sheer pool of unactualized  potentiality encompassing the seemingly opposite entities. A good  example of how this is achieved in Pale Fire is the unity of the per- ception of art by characters supposed to be in juxtaposition to one  another. Shade, by far the most positive character, derives a fair  share of autobiographic and aesthetic details from Nabokov’s own  life and understanding, but so does Kinbote, which makes it impos- sible to reduce him to a loony. Kinbote, for example, describes what  in him reveals a true artist (an “artist and a madman”!) much in  the same terms that Nabokov could use in speaking about himself:  what he says he can do is to “pounce upon the forgotten butterfly of  revelation, wean [himself] abruptly from the habit of things, see the  web of the world, and the warp and the weft of that web.”43  By the very nature of the metaphysical, the “beyond” is  inextricably related to death (to what lies “beyond”) and its  representation. In her investigation into the representation of death  in Over Her Dead Body, Elizabeth Bronfen starts with the interpretive  analysis of Gabriel von Max’s salon painting “Der Anatom”  (1869).44 A beautiful dead woman is the center of this painting;  a seated anatomist gazes intently at her; skulls and other death  paraphernalia are posited to the left of the body, while a live moth is  to her right. This may interest us primarily because of the butterfly  motif. Bronfen writes of the nocturnal butterfly:  In European folklore, the moth, also called “death bird”  because the traces on its body suggest the patterns of a skull,  is iconographically read as a figure of death and immortality.  Because it is a nocturnal butterfly, often found hovering above  graves, classical Greek tradition saw the moth as a figure for  — 96 — </page> <page sequence="12"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” the soul (psyche) departing from a dead body, if death occurred  in the hours of the night. The moth is also used as a figure for  souls in purgatory or for the good or bad spirits of the deceased,  wandering restlessly on earth, which may include demons and  witches. Finally, the moth is understood as a messenger carrying  oracles or omens, and again due to its colouring and its nocturnal  appearance, its presence is thought to presage illness or death.45  The image of a butterfly, so central to Nabokov’s work and so  frequently discussed, is one of the signs, catalogued by Rowe in  his book, that signals Nabokov’s “spectral dimension.” This image  goes to the heart of the related questions of fate and pattern, “order  concealed behind chance.”46 As I pointed out at the beginning of  this chapter, this allows for diametrically opposite hermeneutic  possibilities. Nabokov’s philosophical review “Prof. Woodbridge in  an Essay on Nature Postulates the Reality of the World,” from which  I quoted earlier, also points to an understanding of creativity that is  very Romantic in its essence: the artist is to the world of art as God  is to the world of nature. The Romantic notion of art as a “divine  game”47 once again is filtered through the Nietzschean tradition  of homo ludens (or Dionysiac pessimist—“man of intuition,” artist),  but does not allow for the Romantic-Nietzschean opposition to  the “theoretical man” or scientist (Nabokov the lepidopterist  perfectly merged the artist and the scientist—a very twentieth- century hybridity of his own “gift”). Nabokov’s study of mimicry  in lepidoptery and the intricate patterning and use of “fatidic  dates” in his writings (an obsession he shared with Pushkin) echo  the theories of mimicry and conscious play of the early twentieth- century occultist Pyotr D. Ouspenski (1878-1947), as Alexandrov has  pointed out.48 The fateful Vanessa, the Red Admirable, appearing in  Pale Fire a minute before Shade dies, “flashed and vanished, and  flashed again, with an almost frightening imitation of conscious  play. . . .”49 Nabokov calls Vanessa a “butterfly of doom” in Strong  Opinions50 and ties this to a dubious theory that the Red Admirables  had markings resembling the year 1881 (when Tsar Alexander II  was assassinated and, supposedly, the butterflies were unusually  abundant). This might be one of Nabokov’s multiple mystifications,  but Vanessas do flutter through many a fateful moment in Nabokov’s  — 97 — </page> <page sequence="13"> C h a p t e r  2 fiction (King, Queen, Knave, The Gift, Ada), making a butterfly one of  the most important metaphysical “pointers” in Nabokov. Whatever  this transcendental dimension might be, its structurally necessary  possibility, “iterability” as it were, features prominently in Nabokov.  In Benjaminian terms, the call for “translation” (in every sense of  this word, including being transported elsewhere) is posited at the  heart of the structure of the work in and of itself. There are other relevant metaphysical “pointers” in Pale  Fire, which imply being transported/translated elsewhere; to  name a few: iris, number eight or the lemniscate, translation/ transformation of zero or even triple zero (nothingness or “triple  nothingness”) into the sign of infinity. It seems to me that Boyd,  in his otherwise excellent analysis, misinterpreted some of these  pointers. Thus he writes about Iris Acht, an actress-lover of King  Charles the Beloved’s grandfather. The King sees her portrait in his  room of confinement after the revolution, and her role is important  in his escape because the tunnel through which he flees leads to her  room in the theater. Boyd adduces rather far-fetched connections  between her and Shade’s daughter Hazel (who is, in Boyd’s search  for a unified “author” of Pale Fire, a plausible candidate for this  role from beyond the grave). The connection he makes is that “iris”  points to “hazel” as color because of the “eye association.”51 Much  more convincing would be to interpret Acht in light of Nabokov’s  metaphysical “pointer”—“iris” as the rainbow (the bridge  between worlds) and the sign of eternity “8” (“Acht”). Rainbow  (raduga, in Russian), and as its extension, “iris” (raduzhka, the iris  of the eye) are among those metaphysical “pointers” that often  tie together the themes of death and resurrection (often related to  the death of the father) with fate and gift (and, in many instances,  Pushkin).52 “Acht” or “8” is obviously another “pointer.” Among  the poets of Russian Symbolism, the influence of whom Nabokov  acknowledged, Innokentii Annenskii played a special role. (Volumes  of Annenskii’s poetry are mentioned at the moment of death of  Yasha Chernyshevskii in The Gift.) Annenskii’s metaphysical “deviz  tainstvennyi pokhozh na oprokinutoe vosem’” (“the mysterious  motto is like an eight turned on its side”) was an eloquent example  of Symbolist theosophical vision. In other instances, Boyd interprets  — 98 — </page> <page sequence="14"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” the unsettling proliferation of the figure eight in the text (such as  1888, for example, the meticulously cited year of Acht’s death) only  in terms of “the intense chess ambience” of the tunnel scene.53 Then  there is a “lemniscate” allusion in the Poem, describing Shade’s  dreams as a child (“the miracle of a lemniscate left / Upon wet  sand by nonchalantly deft / Bicycle tires”).54 Kinbote, in his turn,  interprets this allusion, with the help of “Webster’s Second,” as  a figure eight. As the King (Kinbote) flees through the tunnel, in  which he had been thirty years earlier with his teenage lover Oleg,  he sees his own “lemniscate”—the thirty-year-old “patterned  imprint of Oleg’s shoe” in the tunnel. At this point, Boyd arrives at  the interpretation of the “lemniscate” as “infinity,”55 also pointing  out that the unwritten last line 1000 of the Poem, with its three  zeroes, is a “blank, a triple zero like Hazel’s death in one of three  conjoined lakes, Omega, Ozero, Zero.”56 It might be interesting to  note here the affinity with the childish belief of Lolita that the zeros  on the speedometer can all turn back into nines if the car is put in  reverse (time can be reversed). Boyd says that Hazel (in the role  that he assigns her—that of the unified “author”) seems to answer  that “in the repeated 1888 she has Kinbote imagine, death is not  a triple zero but a triple eight, a triple lemniscate, infinity, upon  infinity, upon infinity. . . .”57 The survival of the original, as it were,  is once again possible through being transported (translated) into  something else. Hazel sets out to investigate a mysterious “pale light” in the  barn that spells out a famous “Vanessa Atalanta” message, which  Kinbote fails to decode. The Nabokovians, of course, decoded it— as a warning to Shade not to go near his neighbor’s house (he goes  and dies at the hand of a deranged assassin). The precedent for the  interpretation was set by Barabtarlo,58 who correctly noticed the word  “Atalanta” (Vanessa) repeated three times. I think it is important  to add that, just as in the example of Nabokov’s early poem cited  above,59 the message forms the Russian word talant (talent, gift)  repeated three times as a magic formula. It is also significant that  Kinbote himself, trying to interpret the message, comes up with the  word talant, among other possible “lexical units” (“war,” “talant,”  “her,” “arrant,” etc.), but dismisses all of them as making no sense.60  — 99 — </page> <page sequence="15"> C h a p t e r  2 Because talant is the only Russian word among “the balderdash”  and tentative English, and because including the “truth” but  dismissing it as “silly” or “insignificant” is a favorite strategy of  Nabokov’s, one can assume that the word is not accidental. Talant is  arguably the greatest metaphysical mystery of many of Nabokov’s  works. (One of these works, let us not forget, is actually entitled  The Gift! In this novel, Nabokov employs a very similar technique:  the keyword “gift,” initially present in a poem the protagonist is  composing, is excluded from the “final version”—the key is “lost,”  just as the actual key to the apartment).  The issue of talant is especially important because of the  continuous search for a “unified author” (apart from Nabokov,  naturally) of Pale Fire. To some extent, this “search for the original”  foregrounds interpretation: if one looks at it from the vantage  point of Benjamin’s discussion of translatability, one realizes that  while the original “survives” through translation/interpretation,  the interpretation itself is finite, possessing a Fortleben rather than  Nachleben. Finding the “finite” interpretation proves elusive.  The search continued in the 1990s in The Nabokovian,61 as well as  on the Internet (in 1997-1998), and pitted the “Shadeans” against the  “anti-Shadeans.” The “Shadeans” (e.g. Andrew Field, Julia Bader,  and Boyd himself, at the beginning of the discussions) argued that  the unified author of the text and the inventor of Kinbote and his  Commentary was Shade. Boyd admits to having been a “Shadean”  for a time, but then rejecting this theory on the basis of textual  evidence. The “anti-Shadean” hypothesis is that Kinbote also wrote  the “original”—Shade’s Poem in heroic couplets.  The hypothesis Boyd pursues in his book, as mentioned  previously, posits Shade’s daughter Hazel as “dreaming the dream”  of the Red King, not unlike Alice in Through the Looking Glass, and  “dictating” or “orchestrating” both her father’s Poem and Kinbote’s  Commentary. Hazel could be a “prompter from the beyond,” the  role Boyd tries to ascribe to her, in two mutually opposed cases.  One would be if Nabokov shared the theosophical theories that  accompanied Russian Symbolism in the late nineteenth century,  with their central role for the “eternal feminine.” The other would  have Nabokov creating a tongue-in-cheek parody of metaphysical  — 100 — </page> <page sequence="16"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” certainty, as he often does. (For example, he did it in the case of  Shade’s discovery that his unified vision of the beyond is predicated  on a misspelling in an old lady’s article—“mountain”/“fountain.”)62  As Bronfen wrote, “while Jean-Martin Charcot was experi-  menting with the use of hypnosis to treat patients for hysteria,  spiritualists maintained that at the site of a figuratively deadened  feminine body the immaterial realm of the beyond could become  visible, a contact between the living and the dead be established  and secured, and the boundary between the here and the beyond  blurred.”63 The latter part was arguably Shade and Nabokov’s  quest, but we also know that Nabokov scoffed at well-worn spiritu- alist theories. Boyd’s idea of the poor pudgy Hazel, working in con- sortium with the tongue-tied (and dead) Aunt Maud, as a medium  for a work of genius, is amusingly ironic indeed. Boyd has a vested  interest in the validation of this theory, so he carefully collates the  clues that are present in the narrative. However, this theory can be  also undermined, since its vantage point is the identification of Ha- zel with a Vanessa butterfly, which ties together the “Atalanta” mes- sage, the Vanessa from the Poem, and the actual butterfly flutter- ing teasingly in front of Shade moments before he dies. The fact is  that the Vanessa of the Poem explicitly signified Sybil, Shade’s wife.  Boyd argues that after her death the unattractive Hazel becomes  Vanessa (i.e. her own attractive mother), but there is no textual evi- dence to support this bold development. Without such a “metamor- phosis,” the theory falls apart.  Discussing origin (and thus the “original”), as Benjamin does in  relation to translation, attunes one to the notion of history thought  of in terms of “life,” “survival,” and “afterlife”—that is, history  profoundly aware of mortality. The ambiguity of the afterlife in  Benjamin and Nabokov does not allow for any perfect equivalence  or ultimate signification.  Yet there is always a girl or young woman lurking somewhere  near the locus and moment of the miraculous transcendence of the  world of “here and now” envisioned in terms of imprisonment—as  a cage or jail whose bars define the existence of Kinbote, or a man  making contact with God in one of Kinbote’s accounts, or, for that  matter, Humbert in Lolita. Kinbote escapes through a closet in his  — 101 — </page> <page sequence="17"> C h a p t e r  2 Zemblan castle only to find himself “surrounded by his fears.”64 He  writes of “a personality consisting mainly of the shadows of its own  prison bars,”65 which resonates with an ape allegory that allegedly  gave Nabokov a jolt of inspiration for writing Lolita (the ape, given an  opportunity to paint, comes up only with the pattern of its own cage  bars), as well as with the account by Kinbote of “seeing a man in the  act of making contact with God” whose “clenched hands seemed  to be gripping invisible prison bars.”66 Nabokov, situated between  Western and Russian cultures, vacillates between culturally bound  significations of women: the redeemer and the “eternal feminine”  of Russian culture or an irreducible enigma, the radical Other  of Western culture. In both cases woman as a trope is related to  death. The woman might have any of the culturally inscribed roles  inherent in the semiotization of femininity. As allegory and fetish,  nonetheless, the woman always presents as it hides the referent— death and the beyond.  However, I believe that, like many other pointers to the spectral  dimension catalogued by Rowe, the woman is the sign, but not the  means. Something else is needed to transcend to the metaphysical,  some other medium, and this medium would be Nabokov’s  “secret” (which he evokes mysteriously in poetry and interviews),  something that he takes uncharacteristically seriously. This secret  might be the gift. It seems to be the narrow passage, a point of criss- crossing of the “giant wings” of time from the Poem: “. . . Infinite  foretime and/ Infinite aftertime: above your head/ They close like  giant wings, and you are dead.”67 There is a graphic depiction of  this “lemniscate,” “oprokinutoe vosem,” the hourglass placed on  its side, the infinity, that ties together all of its three elements (the  foretime, the aftertime, and the node in between): it is a butterfly.  This is perhaps why butterflies flutter in Nabokov’s texts when the  “tunnel” to the beyond and the beyond itself are nearby. Just as Eros  in Plato’s Symposium is found to be a spirit and a messenger between  the worlds, the gift is a thing “in-between,” a messenger. Thus a  poem, for example, is a certain “intermediary” between reason and  the beyond. It is a certain “instrument” with which knowledge not  accessible otherwise is obtained. The Vanessa butterfly that Shade  identifies with his wife (love being his Platonic “intermediary,” or  — 102 — </page> <page sequence="18"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” tunnel, to the beyond) and that Boyd tries—not very convincingly— to identify with Hazel, is, I believe, the same secret formula for the  “gift.” Like Nabokov’s gift, merging the insights of science and art,  Nabokov’s butterflies are both specimens of his lepidoptery studies  and harbingers of the beyond. In a similar fashion, the chiasmic  task of translation, according to Nabokov, also bridges the paradox:  “a poet’s patience and scholiastic passion blent.” Butterflies appear  in his texts as actual creatures, as the process of metamorphosis,  or as names (such as Falter, the character from Nabokov’s story  “Ultima Thule,” who claims to have arrived at the ultimate secret  of the universe).68 By virtue of its very nature as gift (whoever  or whatever granted it), it is always accepted and greeted with  gratitude, which Nabokov expresses again and again—hence, his  well known optimism and cheerfulness, his feeling of being made  “to measure of something not quite comprehensible, but wonderful  and benevolent. . . .”69 Véra Nabokov wrote about it in the Foreword  to his posthumous Russian collection Stikhi (1979): “He was  involved in this mystery for many years, almost not realizing it;  and it was it that gave him his impossible cheerfulness and lucidity  even at the time of the biggest hardships and made him completely  invulnerable to any and all stupid and evil criticism.”70  In the “Shadeans” versus the “anti-Shadeans” debate described  above, it might be that neither side has a case. The disturbing  correspondences between the Poem and the Commentary that Ellen  Pifer writes about in Nabokov and the Novel,71 or “the intimacy of  relationship between part and part, when at a surface level they  indeed appear to be utterly remote” that Boyd evokes,72 are not due  to Shade dreaming Kinbote’s dreams or Kinbote dreaming Shade’s  dreams (or for that matter, a third person, Hazel, in Boyd’s theory,  dreaming dreams for both of them), but are a result of all three  partaking—unbeknownst to them—of the same physical (Nabokov’s  imagination) and metaphysical sources. “Passion of science and  patience of poetry,”73 already paradoxical in this unlikely formula  and transformed hilariously in the novel through parody and self- parody, are, after all, doing a very serious job. And the jobs of science  and poetry are ultimately the same. Formulations like these are not  to be made, things like this are not intended to be uttered, because  — 103 — </page> <page sequence="19"> C h a p t e r  2 they are always under the threat of being trivialized and made a lie  by the fact of utterance (as in Tiutchev’s “Silentium!”). Therefore,  they instead have to be worked into the texture of the novel, made,  as in Shade’s “revelation” of the nature of the beyond, “not text, but  texture,”74 or, in Benjaminian terms, they make sure that any fixed  meaning does not exhaust the intrinsic heterogeneity of language. The mystery cannot be explained (so the resolute final interpre- tation is never possible); its presence, however, is made known and  felt, and can be re-created. In Neo-Platonic terms, things are good  only insofar as they are created by Being (Beyond begins with the  initial of Being, rightly notes Boyd).75 Therefore, partaking of the  immutable life of Being is only possible by re-creation of the act of  creation. On this, deeply metaphysical level, the gift partakes of the  life of Being. Nabokov, as Boyd observes, “did know the twentieth- century fashion for mordant metaphysical skepticism.”76 Instead of  postulating metaphysical ideas in a twentieth-century Symposium,  one can deal with the metaphysics, as well as metaphysical uncer- tainty, on the “scholiastic” level as Nabokov does in Pale Fire—“an  intimation of concealed design, the coy expression of an unjusti- fiable trust, a hint of what might lurk within the intimate texture  of things.”77 Hesitation between different hermeneutic possibili- ties creates the Nabokovian metaphysical uncertainty but does not  eliminate the existence of precise patterns of signification. His text  is an endless interplay between the stability of meaning and the in- stability of meaning, with new possibilities opening up every time  some stability seems to be achieved.  The Allegorical Model Bronfen argues that the moth in the painting mentioned above,  depicting an anatomist and a dead woman, introduces a non- metaphorical rhetorical mode—the allegorical. Drawing on Paul de  Man’s writings on allegory, she points out:  Traditionally defined as an extended metaphor, allegory informs  this painting in the sense that it produces a juxtaposition and  tension between all figured relations. What distinguishes the  allegorical mode is that it reveals at the same time that it hides,  — 104 — </page> <page sequence="20"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” and so explicitly points to the incommensurability or disjunction  between signifier and signified. Based on the Greek allos, Other,  allegory indicates a figurative speaking, a speaking in other  terms, of other things. Its rhetorical turn is such that it articulates  the difficulty of determining a conclusive or binding referential  relation between signifier, signified and a nonsemiotic reality.78  Death itself becomes a signified that defies expression or the realm  of nonsemiotic reality altogether.  Preoccupation with death, or more precisely, with a lack of  “conclusive referential relation,” that is the centrality of allegory  in Nabokov’s fiction was first pointed out by Pyotr Bitsilli in “The  Revival of Allegory,” published in Sovremennye zapiski in 1935.79 It  provides a remarkable early insight into the nature of Nabokov’s  art. Commenting on the ending of Invitation to a Beheading, Bitsilli  points out that  everything ends with the “cliff-hanging.” The point is that there  can be no answer to the question, for the question itself cannot  be phrased. Death is the end of life. But can we call that state in  which Cincinnatus lived “life”? Is it not all the same whether he  was decapitated or not? Real life is the movement directed toward  some goal, toward self-discovery in intercourse and in strife with  real people. Death is the completion of life. Life is the thesis— death the antithesis; after which human consciousness expects  some kind of synthesis—some final, extratemporal realization of  the sense of a completed life. But if nothing is asserted in life, if life  does not propose any thesis, then how can there be an antithesis,  and how then is a synthesis possible?80  Bitsilli continues to elaborate on the “life is but a dream” theme in  Sirin, as he argues in his 1938 review of Invitation to a Beheading and  The Eye that Sirin-Nabokov’s “truth” is in glimpsing a vague vision  of something essential that lies beyond the horrifying unreality of  life: “‘Life is but a dream,’ and Dream, as it is well-known, has been  long considered a brother of Death. Sirin goes to the end into this  direction. If so, then life itself means death.”81 The opposites are  conjoined in one.  Life and death/“the beyond” in Nabokov are articulated through  repetition, the recurrent motifs and literary devices, just as the  — 105 — </page> <page sequence="21"> C h a p t e r  2 disappearance and return in Sigmund Freud’s “economic” model of  the avoidance of un-pleasure and its replacement with “production  of pleasure” in his Beyond the Pleasure Principle (exemplified in  the fort-da game played by a child), are predicated on loss and  repetition. Repetition is seen as a “form of control, as a return to  self-assertion in response to an endangering moment of absence.”82  In Jacques Lacan’s reading of the game described by Freud,83 the  production of meaning, which in his interpretation is the aphanisis  (disappearance, fading) of the subject (not just the disappearance  of the mother as Freud states), is tied to the difference between two  opposites. The opposites are represented (fort-da), but at the center  of the child’s game is self-identification of the subject with a lack of  the object of reference. The aim of the game is its end; the aim of life  becomes death itself. In Benjaminian terms, while translation deals  with the afterlife of the original, translation in and of itself does  not signify immortality because it is finite and cannot be translated  further; translation is the end of translation.  As Boyd points out, the production of meaning in Pale Fire  happens in its most prominent conflict: the conflict between the two  opposite minds—Shade’s and Kinbote’s, that of creator/poet and  that of translator/commentator.84 Boyd insightfully observes that  this clash extends beyond the creator’s death. The great inversion of  this novel is the inversion of roles: instead of the sacred insanity of  poetry and scholarly rationality and dryness, one faces a romantic,  mad commentator and a pleasantly, if a bit insipidly, rational poet.  Boyd interprets these roles as two ways of dealing with loss.85  The unsettling “withdrawal from any semantically fixed  encoding”86 was known to the Romantics as the chiasm in the  expression of the sublime. An example would be the striking rhyme  of “prekrasen/uzhasen” (awesome/awful) in reference to Peter I on  the battlefield in Pushkin’s “Poltava.”87 The uncanny effect is similar  to Freud’s unheimlich—two opposites, anxiety and desire or familiar  and strange, conjoined in one. In the case of the violence of death,  the experience is made sharable through the process of translation  into representation. Death as a signified defies representation; it is  a “receding, ungraspable signified, invariably pointing back self- reflexively to other signifiers.”88 As in the poem “On Translating  — 106 — </page> <page sequence="22"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” Eugene Onegin,” translation is made possible only by the violent  death of the original. However, the violence done to the original  by the process of translation is sublated by acknowledging the  limitation of language and producing an allegorical model, the  Other, the Commentary. The allegorical model speaks in other  terms, of other things. Bronfen adds: “It always also articulates  the occulted signifier, present though under erasure.”89 The Greek  diaballo means “to translate, as well as to split, cause strife and  difference, reject, defame, deceive.”90 In a sense, speaking again  in psychoanalytic terms, one recognizes violence inevitably done  to the original and deals with it by giving it “a fixed position,”  confining it to the Commentary.91 The beginning of Kinbote’s  “translation” of Shade’s poem into his own text requires the violent  death of the author. Indeed, in his poem “On Translating Eugene  Onegin,” Nabokov conceptualizes translation as “profanation of  the dead” and describes the process as parasitically feeding off the  helpless original. The critic/translator’s freedom, as he gets rid of  the “original” author (as happens literally in Pale Fire), produces an  unreliable or lucidly mad narrator/interpreter.  In discussing translation as the allegorical mode, we should  be attuned to the notion of repetition. Jean Baudrillard discusses  repetition as emerging from a position of liminality between life and  death, a rhetorical strategy that, according to him, involves doubling  (another characteristic motif of Nabokov’s fiction)—the reanimation  of a model, the return of the “original” in its artificial copy.92 While  the motif of doubling in Nabokov is truly inexhaustible, Pale Fire  alone gives plenty of relevant examples.93 Masha Levina-Parker  addresses the motif of repetition inherent in Nabokov’s fiction,  interpreting it specifically in a context close to that of translation  and allegory: The use of motif repetition, especially in Bildungsroman,  autobiography, or pseudo-autobiography, is usually perceived  precisely as a return . . . to some original element of narration,  be that a subject, a hero, an event, or a discussion. Repetition  therefore always presupposes the presence of a source or a be- ginning, which is positioned outside the system of repetitions,  but which establishes it and defines its composition and function.  — 107 — </page> <page sequence="23"> C h a p t e r  2 Such a point of departure is an “original” of sorts, while the  subsequent repetitions are its more or less faithful copies.94 However, these “copies/repetitions” are never “ideal” copies; the  process of approximation is a series of unfolding attempts, pointing  to some elusive but ultimately unattainable referent positioned  outside the text. The possibility of absolute repetition is illusory and  meaning is endlessly suspended. In relation to translation as “profanation of the dead,” it is  interesting and perhaps significant to note that Kinbote argues that  his name is not an anagram of Botkin, but that it means regicide in  Zemblan.95 Its obvious source of reference is Shakespeare’s “bare  bodkin,” which kills the king. Disa, the rejected queen of Charles  II, bears the name that “echoes Dis, the kingdom of the dead.”96  Reiterating the notion of feeding off of the original, Sybil, Shade’s  wife, calls Kinbote “an elephantine tick; a king-sized botfly;  a macaco worm; the monstrous parasite of a genius.”97 One would  not notice this on the first reading, but Sybil’s vision is artfully  echoed when Botkin is defined in the Index as “American scholar of  Russian descent . . . : king-bot, maggot of extinct fly that once bred  in mammoths and is thought to have hastened their phylogenetic  end.”98  In the post-modernist context, one asks the chicken and the  egg question: is the copy equal to the original? Does the original  produce its reading or does the reading produce the original?  Trying on this kind of approach with Pale Fire, Boyd even entertains  a theory of Kinbote as Shade’s invention, “a mirror-inversion of  himself (exile rather than stay-at-home, lonely homosexual rather  than happily married man, vegetarian rather than meat-eater,  bearded rather than clean-shaven, left- rather than right-handed,  and so on),”99 but eventually has to reject this theory on the basis  of “literary merit,” as it were: if Shade were indeed capable of  concocting such complex narratives, he would have shown, at his  age of sixty-one, the ability to write fiction. Kinbote, on the other  hand, claims to be the “only begetter” of the Poem “Pale Fire,” the  “prompter behind.”100 This, however, is a conclusion based solely  on the sense of his own importance: on his claimed closeness to the  — 108 — </page> <page sequence="24"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” author and the alleged fact of providing Shade with the theme, the  setting,101 and the meaning (himself and his misfortunes as an exiled  king of Zembla). The meanings are often inversions, mirror images  of sorts. An example of such inversion in interpretation is Kinbote’s  complaints in the Commentary that Sybil constantly stood in the  way of his great friendship with Shade, preventing Kinbote from  seeing the poet. Kinbote perversely finds the proof for such claims  in Shade’s expression of love for his wife in “Pale Fire”: “And all  the time, and all the time, my love, / You too are there. . . .”102 The  Index, with just one page dedicated to him compared to two pages  about Kinbote, shows how the poet matters only insofar as he is  interpreted, invented, or seen by the commentator in light of his  own life, work, and circumstances.  Of course, in Nabokov’s “hall of mirrors” the unsettling reality  is that the Commentator himself might be an invented figure. This  points straight to Nabokov’s understanding of both fiction (in all  senses of this word) and translation, as well as their relationship  with one another. It is not accidental that Nabokov’s painstaking  work on the Eugene Onegin Commentary was done between the  years when he started Lolita and finished Pale Fire. De Man’s notion  of all reading as a form of allegory makes one think of what one does  when one performs the reading: it is not literate but interpretive,  and in the case of Pale Fire, it is a radical misreading. One is also  tempted to think about the contrast between Shade, always attuned  to the world outside the self, and the self-obsessed Kinbote:103 the  contrast provides insight into the “fiction” of translation being  concerned with the Other (which always ends up in the self) and its  crucial difference from the creative effort of fiction reaching beyond  the self.  As the allegorical model of Nabokov’s novels stands in direct  relation to his interest in the beyond (and, because of this, in  death), allegory becomes the preferred mode by means of which  death is “rhetorically articulated in language.”104 As Nabokov’s  endeavors of writing and translating became intertwined due to  circumstances and necessity, the allegorical model was extended to  literary translation itself. I think it would be accurate to suggest that  it accounts for Nabokov’s trajectory towards literal translation. His  — 109 — </page> <page sequence="25"> C h a p t e r  2 practice of translation seems to change radically, yet his adherence  to the idea of some “true” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive  and ever present—remains surprisingly constant (the “ideal”  referent positioned outside the text). While Nabokov’s defense  of the technical implications of literalism is well known from the  theoretical squabbles that ensued after Eugene Onegin’s publication,  it is important to remember that philosophically, literalism is related  to the absolute: any claim of ultimate accuracy excludes any form of  relativity. In the following symptomatic comment, Nabokov directly  related this philosophical agenda to the practical choices he was  making while translating Onegin. In his commentary to verses 1-4  of stanza XXXIX of Canto IV, Nabokov makes a connection between  Pushkin’s stanza and an autobiographical allusion disguised as  a translation of André Chénier. (The allusion is to a specific illicit  relationship Pushkin had with a peasant girl on his Mikhailovskoe  estate.) Nabokov, defending his translation of the object of Onegin’s  bucolic affections as “a white-skinned girl”—a strange and least  obvious choice—writes:  Pushkin’s line 3 [“poroi belianki chernookoi . . .”] is, by the by, an  excellent illustration of what I mean by literalism, literality, literal  interpretation. I take “literalism” to mean “absolute accuracy.”  If such accuracy sometimes results in the strange allegoric scene  suggested by the phrase “the letter has killed the spirit,” only  one reason can be imagined: there must have been something  wrong either with the original letter or with the original spirit,  and this is not really a translator’s concern. Pushkin has literally  (i.e. with absolute accuracy) rendered Chénier’s “une blanche”  by belyanka, and the English translator should reincarnate here  both Pushkin and Chénier. It would be false literalism to render  belyanka (“une blanche”) as “a white one”—or, still worse,  “a white female”; and it would be ambiguous to say “fair- faced.”105  Such understanding of “absolute accuracy,” in which unified vision  becomes a hall of mirrors, whose reflections double and triple ad  infinitum, is very much in line with Nabokov’s unusual metaphysics.  Allegory as a strategy allows the translator to partake of the same  “gesture” as the original by signifying difference, by focusing on  — 110 — </page> <page sequence="26"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” other things (commentary, criticism). The in-betweenness points  to the “central aporia” of the allegory, the gap “inscribed in all  production of meaning.”106 While other existing English translations  of Eugene Onegin—by Charles Johnston, Oliver Elton/[Anthony  David Peach] A. D. P. Briggs, James E. Falen, and Walter Arndt— could be called metaphorical, in the sense that they are meant to be  “like the original” (just in another language) and that they are meant  to be read, Nabokov’s idiosyncratic translation is an undertaking of  a different nature—allegorical or, more specifically, metonymical,  related to the original by spatial contiguity rather than complete  identification with it. It can only be studied (and in fact the four  volume “mammoth” grew out of a “little book” intended for  teaching purposes). On the one hand, the literal translation itself  functions as a scholarly source for exact quotes. The entire text of  Eugene Onegin becomes one giant quotation. On the other hand, the  Commentary paradoxically takes on the function of a translation  and becomes in English what Pushkin’s text is supposed to be  in Russian. In Goethe’s terms, it exists not instead (anstatt) of the  original, but rather in its place (an der Stelle). In Westöstlicher Diwan  (West-Eastern Diwan), Goethe assesses what a “perfect” translation  might be. It can be “identical” to the original, but the identity is  “functional,” not absolute. A return to the original is still necessary  and access to it should be open.107 The Commentary and Index in  Pale Fire parody this metonymical mode of translation by distorting  it through a comical and tragic mirror and turning it into its  opposite, the metaphorical: translation becomes appropriation since  everything can be substituted for everything else. As translation  disintegrates into madness, the parody becomes a diagnosis of total  metaphoricity. Nabokov proudly claims that his Onegin is just a “pony” for  students.108 He sacrifices rhyme (retaining only the iambic meter)  and brings his translation closer to prose. Structural parallels to  Pale Fire demonstrate especially well how the translation and  Commentary together reclaim Pushkin’s text as a novel. The prose  aspect of Nabokov’s Onegin cannot be accidental if we consider it  in the light of the allegorical (metonymical) mode of translation. In  “Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances,”  — 111 — </page> <page sequence="27"> C h a p t e r  2 Roman Jakobson draws on the competition of metonymical and  metaphorical devices in the symbolic process of signification:  “Similarity in meaning connects the symbols of a metalanguage  with the symbols of the language referred to. Similarity connects  a metaphorical term with the term for which it is substituted.  Consequently, when constructing a metalanguage to interpret  tropes, the researcher possesses more homogeneous means to  handle metaphor, whereas metonymy, based on a different principle,  easily defies interpretation.”109 Jakobson argues that the functioning  (or rather, malfunctioning) of two major linguistic mechanisms— the metaphorical and the metonymical—are responsible for the  two aphasic afflictions: the “similarity disorder,” predicated on  the incapability of selection and substitution, and the “contiguity  disorder,” hinged on the agrammatical augmentation of words  into a “word heap.”110 The prevalence of one mechanism over the  other also defines literary and artistic trends. “The primacy of the  metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism and  Symbolism” might account for the prevalence of poetry in these two  literary trends, whereas Realism follows “the path of contiguous  relationships” and “synechdochic details.”111 In the context of  the allegorical/metonymical mode of Nabokov’s translation, it  is especially significant that prose, unlike poetry, “is forwarded  essentially by contiguity.”112  The Allegorical Model at Work:   The Nature of the Index, the Nature of the Commentary Upon careful consideration, one cannot fail to notice that Nabokov’s  aesthetic apparatus is at work both in his Index to Eugene Onegin  (and Pale Fire) and the Commentary, as much as it is at work in his  fiction. In other words, translation and its apparatus are not just  what they seem to be, but also vehicles for expressing Nabokov’s  original ideas about the nature of creativity and art. Nabokov’s Index  to Onegin, while certainly serving its necessary utilitarian purposes  (as an integral part of any scholarly work of such dimension), also  fulfills the interpolating function of patterning. One is reminded of  — 112 — </page> <page sequence="28"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” the “hidden pictures” described by Nabokov in the ending of the  Russian version of his memoir, Drugie berega (The Other Shores). The  “camouflage” of the cityscape entangles the details of a magnificent  ship in the distance that the eye at first refuses to register—the ship  that would carry Nabokov, in the third act of exile, to America.  Nabokov likens this vision to “hidden pictures” (“Naidite, chto  spriatal matros”—“Find what a sailor has hidden”) and writes:  “odnazhdy uvidennoe ne mozhet byt vozvrashcheno v khaos  nikogda” (“what is once seen, can never be returned back into  chaos”).113  It is a fundamental creative principle that points in two  directions simultaneously: first, the discovery lies within the  picture itself, not outside it (“not text, but texture,” to quote “Pale  Fire”); and second, once one “sees” the “answer,” one is able to see  only it—the entanglement of “texture” will be destroyed. Of course,  in the ending of The Other Shores, this principle deals with the  pattern of the personal fate of the author, but the same principle is  applicable to Nabokov’s poetics—patterning and repetition rather  than ideological interpolations (such interpolations would be the  method of Lev Tolstoi, for example). The Index, used in both Pale  Fire and Onegin, is a fascinating device of double nature: whereas it  feigns being merely a helpful apparatus to the main text, it actually  hides; and, as it creates certain patterns or “signal words” that  might have remained concealed even throughout the Commentary,  it discloses.  Just as most of Nabokov’s plots create “chaos” that seems to  be devoid of any order until patterns and repetitions “pull out”  a thread that has been previously concealed, the chaos of the Index  seems at first glance to be plotless, as any reference apparatus would  be: “Flora,” “Florence,” and “Florida,” for example, coexist for no  reason other than the alphabetical order of references. However,  the “signal words” trace a hidden path through the apparent chaos  of the apparatus. If one takes, for example, the word “Abyssinia  (Ethiopia)” in Nabokov’s Commentary to Onegin, one first finds it  as a reference to Pushkin’s interest in his pedigree and Ethiopian  descent (also explored in Pushkin’s poem “My Pedigree” (“Moia  rodoslovnaia”), the issues raised in the commentary to the first  — 113 — </page> <page sequence="29"> C h a p t e r  2 stanza of Onegin. Abyssinia, however, has nothing to do with the  indexed stanza about Onegin’s uncle, just as the poem “My Pedigree”  bears no relation to it, except for certain affinity of meter and rhyme.  This seemingly unrelated commentary then veers off into tracking  “My Pedigree” (Onegin’s uncle and the relevant stanza now totally  forgotten!) back to the imitation of Pierre-Jean de Béranger’s  “Le Vilain” and ends in a surprising pronouncement, revealing  more about Nabokov than Pushkin: “This can only be explained  by Pushkin’s habit of borrowing from mediocrities to amuse  his genius.”114 (This becomes especially poignant in light of the  revelations in 2004 of Nabokov’s “plagiarism” in Lolita—his alleged  borrowings from an obscure German writer, Heinz von Lichberg.)  The next reference to Ethiopia emerges in the commentary to line 14  of the same Canto I (“but harmful is the North to me”)—Pushkin’s  allusion to his exile to Bessarabia, where Eugene Onegin was started.  “Ethiopian” here appears as a reference to Pyotr Viazemskii’s pun  in his letter to Alexander Turgenev, calling Pushkin “bes arabskii”  (“Arabian devil”), a pun on “the Bessarabian” (“bessarabskii”). It  should actually be “arapskii,” explains Nabokov patiently, referring  to “arap” or “Blackamoor.” However, this “Ethiopian” reference is  marginal to the commentary; it actually discusses how “Pushkin  often alludes to personal and political matters in geographical,  seasonal, and meteorological terms.”115 The next reference to  Abyssinia has very little to do with the commentary to Canto X,  stanza IV. This commentary discusses at length Alexander I’s title  of “head of kings”116 after the defeat of Napoleon. The ending of  the commentary, however, is: “Negus nagast, the title of Abyssinian  emperors, means ‘king of kings.’”117 Since “Abyssinian” is a “signal  word,” an unmistakable reference to Pushkin, it not only establishes  Pushkin’s primacy over the actual emperor of his time,118 but it  immediately calls to mind for the Russian reader an entire hidden  “chain” of obvious references—one of Pushkin’s perennial motifs,  “Poet—Tsar,” as in the famous “You are Tsar—live alone.”119 Thus  the “Abyssinian” thread, inextricably related to Pushkin himself,  through commentary barely relevant to the referenced lines of  translation, leads one through Nabokovian aesthetics to the bliss  and freedom of creative solitude—one of Nabokov’s most persistent  — 114 — </page> <page sequence="30"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” and important themes. All of the remaining “Abyssinian” references  occur in Nabokov’s Appendix One, about Pushkin’s ancestor Abram  Gannibal. Having painstakingly traced all available sources to check  a rather dubious hypothesis of Pushkin’s descent from Ethiopian  royalty, Nabokov concludes Gannibal’s story with a semi-absurd  final paragraph, in which the very last “Abyssinian” reference  occurs.  We recall Coleridge’s Abyssinian maid (Kubla Khan, 1797) singing  of “Mount Abora,” which (unless it merely echoes the name of  the musical instrument) is, I suggest, either Mt. Tabor, an amba  (natural citadel), some 3000 feet high in the Siré district of the  Tigré, or still more exactly the unlocated amba Abora, which I find  mentioned by the chronicler Za-Ouald (in Basset’s translation) as  being the burial place of a certain high official named Gyorgis  (one of Poncet’s two governors?) in 1707. We may further imagine  that Coleridge’s and Poncet’s doleful singer was none other  than Pushkin’s great-great-grandmother; that her lord, either of  Poncet’s two hosts, was Pushkin’s great-great-grandfather; and  that the latter was a son of Cella Christos, Dr. Johnson’s Rasselas.  There is nothing in the annals of Russian Pushkinology to restrain  one from the elaboration of such fancies.120  Not only does this remind one of Nabokov’s own scholarly  mystifications (one wonders whether anyone has ever checked out  all these rather improbable chroniclers Nabokov refers to), but it also  points to the key theme of the failure at interpretation in Pale Fire  and in Nabokov’s Pushkin lecture of 1937: the attempts to construct  a “plausible” life of a poet with a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s  work, if not the poet himself.” One is also reminded of the famous  mystification in The Gift, when a gullible Russian, returning to  Petersburg after a long time abroad and not being aware of Pushkin’s  death in 1837, is shown an elderly gentleman at the theater and told  that he is Pushkin. The whole alternative life of Pushkin (or what  it might have been, had he not been killed) suddenly grows out of  nothing, out of a bubble of mystification, in which amusement is  mixed with piercing sense of chance, possibility, and loss.  The dynamics of the Index become even more clear if one  takes a look at its parody in Pale Fire. The agenda of the Index in  — 115 — </page> <page sequence="31"> C h a p t e r  2 Pale Fire is of course made much more obvious by the mere fact  that Pale Fire is a work of fiction, masquerading as a poem with  accompanying scholarly apparatus. The original (the Poem) is being  “translated”/appropriated by the Commentary; the Index makes  the task of appropriation complete. The Commentary as translation  makes choices about how and what to comment on, thus forcing the  resisting original into the Procrustean bed of interpretation; but the  Index bares the mechanism of translation to its “bones,” so to speak,  since it maintains control entirely by selection. In the Commentary,  two struggling voices still have to co-exist out of necessity—that of  Shade and that of Kinbote; in the Index, Kinbote, as Boyd puts it,  “has no competition: no other voice can be heard.”121 By creating  order within the scholarly framework, the Index legitimizes Zembla,  “almost seeming to verify its validity and refute our recent dismissal,  until we remember that it confirms only the relentless method of his  [Kinbote’s] particular madness.”122 The most obvious example of this  selective method would be the “cast” of characters from the Index.  G, K, S, as we are informed, “stand for the three main characters in  this work,” that is, Gradus, Kinbote, and Shade.123 By the time the  reader reaches the Index, he or she has supposedly realized that two  of the three “main characters” mentioned are madmen. This, one  might think ironically, sets the right tone for the Index! Shade’s wife  Sybil gets a reference in “passim,” and Shade’s daughter Hazel gets  two lines full of cruel irony, since we know that her suicide had been  caused by her perceived physical ugliness (according to Kinbote,  she deserves “great respect, having preferred the beauty of death  to the ugliness of life”).124 Shade himself is indexed in about one  page, but most of the entries describe him as seen through the eyes  of Kinbote: “his first brush with death as visualized by K, and his  beginning the poem while K plays chess at the Students’ club, 1,” or  “the complications of K’s marriage compared to the plainness of S’s,  275.”125 Shade’s major works are not indexed at all (the exception is  “his work on Pale Fire and friendship with K”).126  Kinbote, defined as “an intimate friend of S, his literary adviser,  editor and commentator,”127 gets two full pages—considerably more  than the author he is supposed to be editing and commenting on.  Kinbote’s entries describe minute details of his life and character,  — 116 — </page> <page sequence="32"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” bringing out his obsessions, his homosexuality, his misogyny, and  absurdly infusing completely unrelated lines of the Poem with “his  modesty, 34”; “his anxieties and insomnia, 62”; “his sense of humor,  79”; his own “boyhood. . . , 162,”128 etc. Of all other residents of  New Wye, only Botkin makes a disconcerting appearance. Apart  from the reader’s guess that this eccentric Slavic professor might  be the insane Kinbote in “real life” (the notion of “real” now so  far removed that the actual existence of this nebulous campus can  be put into question), Botkin is not even a character in the novel!  The last line of his entry, however, makes a sly reference to Hamlet  (by defining “botkin, or bodkin, a Danish stiletto,”129 etc.), thus  obliquely evoking Hamlet’s famous “to be or not to be” soliloquy  and its puzzling over the beyond.  The general method of the Index is to inundate, by slight of  hand and outlandish fabrications, Shade’s work with Zembla, its  king (Kinbote is the “King” of the Index!), and Kinbote’s personal  obsessions. For example, an entry for Gradus claims that line 596 of  the Poem mentions his name in an unpublished variant and talks of  Gradus’s wait in Geneva.130 However, when we return to the Poem,  we plainly see that there is nothing there about Gradus: the stanza  is about the difficulty of talking to “our dear dead” in our dreams,  in which a long dead “old chum” might be not at all surprised to see  us at the door, and “points at the puddles in his basement room.”131  The matter is complicated, however, by the fact that what the Index  is actually “indexing” is not the line itself, but rather Kinbote’s  Commentary on this line. This commentary suggests that “Lethe  leaks in the dreary terms of defective plumbing”132 and offers  a “variant,” fabricated by Kinbote, which mentions “Tanagra dust.”  As readers, we are supposed to put the three last letters of the first  word and the first two of the second word together, get the name  Gradus, and become convinced that it was, as the entry “Variants”  in the Index informs us, “a remarkable case of foreknowledge.”133  Finally, the Index as a whole symbolically concludes with the entry  of “Zembla,” “a distant northern land” (the “North” where Pushkin  had so much trouble!), with no references to any lines of the Poem  at all. The absence of references makes sense because Zembla is  mentioned only once in the Poem, and even this mention is a joking  — 117 — </page> <page sequence="33"> C h a p t e r  2 reference to Pope, which bitterly disappoints Kinbote. There is  another reason for the absence as well: there is no need to make  references; every single line of the Poem has become Zembla by now,  as the act of the Poem’s appropriation has been completed. In his  Foreword, Kinbote unambiguously states that it is the commentator  who has the last word. He means that his “word” outweighs that of  the author, and he indeed transforms Shade’s text into a text about  Zembla: he does have the last word, as it literally becomes the last  word of the book. Shade’s Poem famously lacks its last line, but  Kinbote has provided it for the novel as a whole: the last line of the  novel is “Zembla.” Nabokov’s creation of patterns is equally important in his  Commentary to Onegin, with its multiple examples of the “fatidic”  dates tying biographical information in with the translated text. For  example, the comment on Baron Anton Delvig, in relation to Canto  VI, stanza XX, references the “marvelous coincidence “of Delvig  dying” on the anniversary of death of the fictional Lenskii (who  is compared to him here on the eve of a fatal duel).”134 Nabokov  further notes that the wake for Delvig was held by his friends— Pushkin, Viazemskii, Evgenii Baratynskii, and Nikolai Iazykov—on  January 27, 1831, exactly six years before Pushkin’s own duel.135 The  death of the author, like the death of the father, forever looms at the  heart of Nabokov’s work. In Pale Fire, for example, Shade, Kinbote,  and Gradus (the author, the commentator, and the assassin), all  share the same birthday—July 5, and Shade is killed on Nabokov’s  father’s birthday—July 21. This, among other things, allows Boyd  to argue that Nabokov in Pale Fire transforms his father’s death into  the “shambolic farce” of Shade’s assassination, just as he “turns  his father’s death into a cosmic chess game” in the “margins of his  autobiography.”136 Nabokov’s father was fatally shot in an assassin’s  attempt on the life of another man—Pavel Miliukov, Nabokov’s  father’s former ideological adversary from the State Duma. Kinbote  calls Shade’s assassination in lieu of his own “the farce of fate.”137  Nabokov treats Pushkin’s art and life as an ethical and  aesthetical paradigm. In “Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible,”  Nabokov talks of Pushkin’s truth being different both from truth  as brilliant illusion and from “Russian truth,” with its inexorable  — 118 — </page> <page sequence="34"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” impetuosity. Pushkin’s truth is the aesthetic truth—the truth of art.  It is significant that Nabokov’s friend Khodasevich thus defined the  central aspect of Pushkin’s art: “Pushkin subjugated both himself  and all coming Russian literature to the voice of internal truth. To  follow Pushkin is to share this burden. Pushkin was first to judge  himself in his art by final judgment and bequest to a Russian writer  a fateful liaison between man and artist, between personal life and  creative fate.”138 Another aspect of Pushkin’s work also noted by  Khodasevich—that of “profanity” as a combination of the serious  and the funny—is remarkably similar to Nabokov’s “comic/cosmic”  juxtaposition, hinged only on the difference of one consonant.  Fate and life intertwine in many ways, and mimicry and  patterning are Nabokov’s devices of choice to herald this  intertwining. Life imitating art, Nabokov’s favorite theme related to  the issues of mimicry and conscious play, is what he dubs a “classical  case of life’s playing up to art” in the Onegin Commentary.139  Thus Lenskii’s actions before his fateful duel are synchronized in  Nabokov’s Commentary with Lord Byron’s life (Byron being one of  Lenskii’s prototypes). While Lenskii is going to his last ball, writing  his last elegy, and fighting the duel (January 12, 13, and 14, 1821,  respectively), Byron actually makes corresponding entries in his  diary in Ravenna, Italy, about seeing masked revelers singing and  dancing, “for tomorrow they may die,” about only gods knowing  whether life or death is better, and, finally, about “firing pistols— good shooting.”140 The patterning extends itself beyond plots and  dates to the patterning of Pushkin’s Onegin stanza on a sonnet, as  well as the alliterative order of his poetic language. For example,  Nabokov comments on the “alliterative magic that our poet  distills”141 from lining up the characters of popular French, German,  and English novels (such characters as Julie Wolmar, Malek-Adel,  Gustave de Linar, Werther, Sir Charles Grandison). Nabokov thinks  it to be a perfect example of how the artist finds “a poetic pattern in  pedestrian chaos.”142 A characteristic example of a fatidic date in the Commentary,  Pushkin’s birth in 1799, also brings together Nabokov’s ideas on the  relation of life and art. The date in question comes up as part of  a comment on Nikolai Karamzin that bears an uncanny resemblance  — 119 — </page> <page sequence="35"> C h a p t e r  2 to Shade’s “Life is a message scribbled in the dark. / Anonymous.”143  Nabokov explains how in a bouts-rimés exchange Karamzin  made a “New Year prophesy for 1799,” presaging the appearance  of the greatest Russian poet: “To sing all things, Pindar will be  reborn.”144 The peculiar and perhaps significant characteristic of  this comment on Karamzin, Pushkin’s important older friend and  the famous author of the History of the Russian State, is that the only  other detail about him that Nabokov found necessary to include  was his epigram that Nabokov translated thus: “Life? A romance.  By whom? Anonymous. / We spell it out; it makes us laugh and  weep, / And then puts us / To sleep.” (“Chto nasha zhizn? Roman.— Kto avtor? Anonim. / Chitaem po skladam, smeemsia, plachem . . .  spim.”) This inclusion of Karamzin’s epigram can only be explained  by it itself being the source of Shade’s lines in Pale Fire. Nabokov’s commentaries are delightfully personal and, as  those of Kinbote, reflect much of the commentator’s biography  (or “fictional” biography). For example, Nabokov discusses  the “fancies of the British Muse” that “disturb the sleep of the  otrokovitsa” (maiden). (Pushkin mistakenly includes the French Jean  Sbogar by Charles Nodier, 1818, in these British “fancies.”) Nabokov  makes the following ironic comment on the dangerously attractive  “amateur communist” Sbogar: “He is interested in the redistribution  of riches. But I am not an otrokovitsa, and at this point Sbogar ceased  to disturb my sleep.”145  However, just as Kinbote’s Commentary is not reliable,  Nabokov’s Commentary should not be trusted. It serves too many  purposes at once: it is a serious philological study; it serves the less  serious purpose of self-parody; and it settles scores with critics,  literary enemies—past and present—and former friends. In one  instance, Nabokov directly explains his choice of emphasis on  a particular word in his translation by an autobiographic detail.  Putting emphasis on Why (it literally should translate as What for)  in “Zachem vy posetili nas?” (Tatiana’s letter to Onegin), Nabokov  translates line 22 of the letter as “Why did you visit us?” explaining  his emphatic, pathétique “why” as the product of a “wonderful  record (played for me one day in Talcottville by Edmund Wilson) of  Tarasova’s recitation of Tatiana’s letter.”146 This comment, however,  — 120 — </page> <page sequence="36"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” is itself a parody of the genre of “personal” pushkinistika (Pushkin  studies) in general and of Wilson’s innocent trust in various  interpreters of Pushkin (especially Soviet) in particular.147  Family legends also play a big part in Nabokov’s Commentary.  For example, the history of Pushkin’s duel with Kondratii Ryleev  (part of the commentary on verse 4-6, Canto IV, stanza XIX) on  Ryleev’s estate Batovo, which later belonged to the Nabokovs,  becomes carefully orchestrated with Nabokov’s own childhood  memories of his strolls along a wooded path known as “Le Chemin  du Pendu.”148 While Nabokov objects on multiple occasions to  dragging biography into hermeneutic efforts, he does engage in this  practice both by inscribing the codified biographical information into  his fiction and, for example, by discovering Pushkin’s biographical  details (his affair with a peasant girl that produced an illegitimate  child) behind the veil of Chénier, forming a “marvelous mask, the  disguise of a personal emotion.”149  The debate about the legitimacy of or faithfulness in translation  is also considered within the framework of metaphysical certainty  (or uncertainty). In Pale Fire this problem is refracted through  the teasing possibility of one unified author in the novel and the  reliability of its multiple narratives. The unreliability of the narrator  is one of the main thematic nodes of Pale Fire. The unreliability  of commentaries is also treated by Nabokov at length in the  Commentary to Onegin, especially whenever he deals with the  Soviet or Russian commentators.150 Such would be his comment  to, Canto III, stanza XII, verse 10, which is rather amusing in light  of Rowe’s approach to Nabokov’s metaphysical dimension: that  is, his cataloguing of situations that lead to the appearance of  ghosts in Nabokov’s fiction. Nabokov talks of ghosts appearing  in inept criticism, but the only ghosts that make their appearance  are “bibliographic spooks . . . the references to nonexistent authors  and works”151 in notes on Onegin by the Russian commentator  Dmitrii Chizhevskii. In a similarly funny twist, in Pale Fire we  encounter the two “Shadeans”: “inept” professors from Kinbote’s  Index, whom Sybil is trying to impose on Kinbote as co-editors of  her late husband’s manuscript, and whom Kinbote showers with  contempt. Boyd explains that they are doubling in the novel as  — 121 — </page> <page sequence="37"> C h a p t e r  2 “Andronnikov and Niagarin” (and the second time as “Niagarin  and Andronnikov”), haplessly pursuing the disappeared jewels of  the King. Kinbote writes in the Index: “two Soviet ‘experts’ still in  quest of a buried treasure, 130, 681, 741; see Crown Jewels.”152 All  this confusing doubling has perhaps yet another layer concerning  commentary and criticism: Iraklii Andronikov was a popular Soviet  commentator of Lermontov. Finally, the Commentary becomes the site of Nabokov’s  polemical vision of the genesis of Pushkin’s art: systematically  uncovering Pushkin’s foreign sources, Nabokov demonstrates how  appropriation and borrowing, in Pushkin’s case, had the uncanny  ability to generate a new origin. In a characteristic example,  Nabokov writes in his Commentary about Pushkin’s defense of  the Gallicisms. Pushkin exclaims: “Where are our Addisons, La  Harpes, Schlegels? . . . Whose [Russian] critical works can we use  for reference and support?” Viazemskii chimes in: “You did well  to come out in defense of Gallicisms. Someday we must really say  aloud that metaphysical Russian is with us still in a barbaric state.  God grant it may acquire form someday similarly to the French  language, to that limpid, precise language of prose, i.e., to the  language of thought.”153 Nabokov shows how Pushkin’s Gallicisms  formed new Russian expressions in their own right, such as the  “liubeznaia nebrezhnost” (“aimiable abandon”) that characterizes  Tatiana’s writing style. Most of European literature came to Russia  through translations from French and occasionally from German,  rendering the very idea of authorship problematic. Reading Samuel  Richardson, for example, the Russian reader was in fact reading the  abbé Antoine François Prévost with his understanding of “elegant  taste.” If the notion of authorship is inherently problematic, what  are we reading in the case of Nabokov’s translation?  Eugene Onegin: Nabokov’s Literal ism Perhaps what we are reading is a “foundation myth” of Nabokov’s  own writing.154 It is widely known that Nabokov attributed  mystical importance to the fact of having being born on the same  — 122 — </page> <page sequence="38"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” day as Shakespeare (Shakespeare being another “foundation  myth” that served as a genesis and model to many of Nabokov’s  English-language novels, just as Pushkin served to the Russian  ones—a sort of an “English-language double” of Pushkin) and one  hundred years after Pushkin. According to A. Bessonova and V. Vik-  torovich, Nabokov acted as the first Nabokovian scholar when,  in his translation and Commentary, he made a “non-sentimental  journey” to his own literary sources.155 Pushkin provides the  framework for Nabokov’s Russian fiction. Mary starts with a quote  from Onegin’s Canto XLVII. The Gift, the last of Nabokov’s Russian  novels, ends with a sonnet written in Onegin stanza, reiterating the  “open ending” of Pushkin’s novel. In The Gift, “s golosom Pushkina  slivalsia golos otsa” (“with Pushkin’s voice merged the voice of his  father”).156 The antithesis and antidote to the “truth” of the “dry  labor” of Chernyshevskii’s life in The Gift is Pushkin and his truth.  The architectonics of The Gift (as those of Pushkin’s own Onegin  and Nabokov’s Pale Fire) are those of a meta-novel: the “meta- plot” of creativity, of a writer’s work, which brings into focus in  the denouement of the novel all of the separate plot-lines of fate,  art, love, and death.157 Nabokov’s English novels also use specific  asides and digressions from Pushkin’s “free novel,” as the poet  called his Onegin, often inverting them for parody and turning them  into expressive details or plots, or even specific situations within  plots. Thus, for example, in Ada, Demon and Marina’s supposedly  salacious encounter in the intermission between the acts of a play,  plainly modeled on Onegin, becomes funniest and most dubious  if read against the events taking place in the respective acts of the  play; the incestuous situation of Ada might be viewed as a parodic  transformation of Onegin’s response to Tatiana’s declaration of love:  “I love you with a brother’s love / and maybe still more tenderly.”158  Characters in Nabokov’s English novels (be they The Real Life of  Sebastian Knight, Lolita, Ada, or Pale Fire) are also preoccupied or  even obsessed—literally or metaphorically—with the process of  accessing the truth of the original, or finding a perfect copy, a double  of the elusive original—in short, with the process of translation. Apart from the literalism of his translation per se, Nabokov’s  “trespassing” on the boundaries of scholarly genre caused  — 123 — </page> <page sequence="39"> C h a p t e r  2 controversy and lengthy public polemics in the West, and his  challenge to Pushkin as national myth caused and is bound to  cause further controversy in Russia.159 Since Vissarion Belinskii’s  assessment of Eugene Onegin in the nineteenth century as an  “encyclopedia of Russian life and a national work of art to its  highest degree,” a truism that generations of Russian middle  school students have learned by heart, Pushkin has served as “the  weightiest testimony of authenticity, of the primacy of national  Russian culture.”160 Nabokov’s meticulous search for Pushkin’s  European sources made all the “sacred cows” of Russian cultural  nationalism look like cultural appropriations: even the Russian  winter, the melancholic Tatiana and her old niania (nanny)—all  sacrosanct cultural icons—turn out to be metamorphed renditions  of their French, German, and English cultural prototypes.161 In  his “Description of the Text” that precedes the translation itself,  Nabokov writes (in a description that makes one think of the setting  of Ada): “It is not a ‘picture of Russian life’; it is at best the picture of  a little group of Russians, in the second decade of the last century,  crossed with all the more obvious characters of western European  romance and placed in a stylized Russia, which would disintegrate  at once if the French props were removed and if the French  impersonators of English and German writers stopped prompting  the Russian speaking heroes and heroines.”162 Nabokov is sublimely uninterested in the social aspects of the  novel, which had been the emphasis of nineteenth-century Russian  criticism (e.g. Belinskii or “naturalnaia shkola” [“naturalist school”])  and, similarly, of Soviet criticism. Nabokov’s cultural archeology  presages certain aspects of Iurii Lotman’s scholarship. But the  center of his effort is the novel’s “creative history and genesis of  Onegin as a work of language.”163 As Nabokov wrote in his Gogol,  Gogol’s work, “as all great literary achievements, is a phenomenon  of language and not one of ideas.”164 Echoing this pronouncement,  he observes in the “Description of the Text”: “The paradoxical part,  from a translator’s point of view, is that the only Russian element  of importance [in Eugene Onegin] is this speech, Pushkin’s language,  undulating and flashing through verse melodies the likes of which  had never been known before in Russia.”165  — 124 — </page> <page sequence="40"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” It makes little sense—if any—to get incensed, as Wilson did,  because Nabokov chose the strangest or most obscure words (such  as “prognostications” or “tears of conjurement”) and to argue  whether one could do better substituting “tit for tat.” Instead, in the  remaining part of this discussion I aim to investigate exactly how  literalism is achieved and by what criteria we might assess the result.  Boyd claimed that syntactical quaintness, which characterized  Nabokov’s literalism, was aimed at making the reader meet Pushkin  “face to face,” at drawing the reader’s attention to the original.166  This makes sense, since the translation grew out of teaching the  text and, certainly, according to Nabokov himself, ideally should  read parallel to the original or should inspire the reader to learn the  language of the original.167 Alexander Dolinin provides a different  theoretical explanation. His theory is based on Shklovskii’s effect  of ostranenie, as he maintains that Nabokov deliberately violates  the division of a line into syntactical units normal for English  versification to make it “strange.”168 Dolinin’s approach might be indebted to Mikhail Gasparov’s  excellent article on another, much earlier example of literalism in  translation, namely the famous poet-Symbolist Valerii Briusov’s  translations of The Aeneid.169 Briusov attempted to translate The  Aeneid many times: his first translations were accomplished when  he was still a teenager, a student in a gymnasium; later, in 1899,  he translated Books II and IV of the Aeneid in expert hexameters.  In 1913, Mikhail Sabashnikov (a publisher with whom, by a twist  of fate, Nabokov’s father was to fight in a duel) offered to publish  Briusov’s Aeneid in his series “The Monuments of World Literature.”  Sabashnikov’s edition never came out due to the upheavals of Russian  history, but Briusov’s translation, some notes, and a foreword to that  translation do exist. Briusov rejected the versions he had written  before and started anew, this time making his translation as literal as  possible. According to Gasparov, a comparison of Briusov’s different  versions allows one to understand “Briusov’s path to literalism.”170  The progress of Briusov’s work from version to version, described  by Gasparov and substantiated with multiple examples, provides  insight into the procedures of any literary translator, including  Nabokov, adopting bukvalizm (literalism) as his or her approach.  — 125 — </page> <page sequence="41"> C h a p t e r  2 Briusov called his first, earliest version “not a translation but  a paraphrase.”171 This is similar to Nabokov’s own term. Briusov  makes a transition to “poetic translation” by making paraphrases  and images more precise, bringing them closer to the original. The  second stage of his work (“so that an artistic translation can serve  at the same time as an artistic crib”) involves bringing grammatical  forms closer to the original, changing the word order to that of  the Latin original, and shifting stresses in proper names to make  them sound as they did in Latin and not as is culturally accepted  in Russian.172 The result is decisively strange and barely readable:  even a culturally prepared reader has to make an effort to follow  unusual syntax while at the same time making sense of multiple  names that no longer resemble their culturally established Russian  counterparts.  Further discussion of literalism may go (and does go, in  Gasparov’s article) into two different directions. One direction is  defining what literalism in translation is; the other is articulating  the motivation and theory of literalism’s practitioner. The former,  in Gasparov’s formulation, may provide a valuable insight into  Nabokov’s literalism. Gasparov makes use of a notion that exists  in the theory of non-literary translation—that of the “length of  context” (a unit of the original text of such length for which one can  find in a translation an equivalent unit of absolute or near absolute  correspondence). Depending on the length of context, non-literary  translations are divided into roughly “word-to-word,” “syntagm-to- syntagm,” “phrase-to-phrase.”173 Gasparov suggests applying this  notion to literary translation as well, pointing out that the “length  of context” in this case might vary from word, to verse, to stanza,  to paragraph, and even to a work as a whole.174 Thus translations  may follow the original with a word-to-word precision, even by  including in italics or brackets those words that were not present  in the original, but were added in translation out of necessity (as  is the case in some translations of the scriptures); or translations  might become Nachdichtungen (adaptations). Many translations of  the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, with titles such as “From  Horace” or “From Anacreon,” for example, aimed at conveying only  an emotional impulse of the original.175 The translation program of  — 126 — </page> <page sequence="42"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” the mature Briusov, the program of bukvalizm, is thus that of the  “shortening of ‘length of context.’”176 If we were to apply the “length  of context” approach to Nabokov’s translation of Onegin, we would  have to agree that the length of context Nabokov aimed at was that  of the line. He himself claimed a “closer line-by-line fit (entailing  a rigorous coincidence of enjambments and the elimination of  verse transposal)”  as the “technical” criterion for perfecting his  literalism.177  Nabokov asked himself in the Foreword, “can a rhymed  poem like Eugene Onegin be truly translated with the retention of  its rhymes?” His answer was “of course . . . no.”178 So what does  Nabokov sacrifice, apart from what he dismissively called “pleasure- measure”? According to him, pretty much everything except iambic  meter:  In transposing Eugene Onegin from Pushkin’s Russian into my  English I have sacrificed to completeness of meaning every  formal element save the iambic rhythm: its retention assisted  rather than hindered fidelity; I put up with a greater number of  enjambments, but in the few cases in which the iambic measure  demanded a pinching or padding of sense, without a qualm  I immolated rhythm to reason. In fact, to my ideal of literalism  I sacrificed everything (elegance, euphony, clarity, good taste,  modern usage, and even grammar) that the dainty mimic prizes  higher than truth. Pushkin has likened translators to horses  changed at the posthouses of civilization. The greatest reward  I can think of is that students may use my work as a pony.179  Nabokov estimated that the text of Evgenii Onegin contained 5,523  iambic lines,180 whose stanza—Pushkin’s invention in Russian—is  based on a sonnet form “with a regular scheme of feminine and  masculine rhymes: ababeecciddiff.”181  Despite the quaintness of certain aspects of Nabokov’s  translation, it still retains what Liuba Tarvi called “‘iambic’  harmony and wholeness,” perhaps since it was the only element  consciously preserved by Nabokov as a translator.182 Dolinin  claimed that Nabokov actually created “perfect iambic clones,”  “mirror reflections” of Pushkin’s tetrameters.183 Dolinin estimated  a rather high percentage of such clones, about 14 percent of all  — 127 — </page> <page sequence="43"> C h a p t e r  2 the lines. Tarvi undertook a very interesting experiment to verify  this empirical estimate of Dolinin by developing a set of rigorous  criteria, such as number of syllables in a line; rhythm (i.e. the variety  of tonal arrangements in a line—the way stresses are imposed  on the metric composition of the line and its coincidence with  Pushkin’s arrangement; this criterion also shows whether Pushkin’s  and Nabokov’s lines coincide in their masculine/feminine rhyme);  semantic parameter (the category on which Nabokov insisted  himself);184 and, finally, syntactical parameter (i.e. preservation of  the order of words in a line). Tarvi’s methodical application of these  criteria to all 5,523 lines of the text yields a result substantially lower  than Dolinin’s estimate—213 “imperfect clones,” i.e. 3.8 percent,  while in only 14 lines was the coincidence according to all four  criteria complete and resulted in “perfect clones.”185 An example of  such a “perfect clone” can be either a line consisting mostly/only  of names, which makes it a natural clone (e.g. Canto VIII, stanza  XXXV, verse 4: “Mme de Stael, Bichat, Tissot”), or those rare ones in  which English lexical equivalents by chance and by choice contain  the same number of syllables, same stresses, and thus can be  syntactically arranged in a perfect equivalent (e.g. Canto III, stanza  I, verse 14: “pro dozd, pro len, pro skotnyi dvor” as “of rain, of flax,  of cattle yard”).  Tarvi convincingly demonstrates how Nabokov, having chosen  the poetic line as the main building block of his literal translation,  consistently works at perfecting the interlinear correspondence  between the original and his translation in the 1975 edition. For  example, to create a closer interlinear correspondence to the Russian  line, Nabokov eliminates the verb (thus making the syntactical  structure unusual for an English sentence) in Canto I, stanza  XXXVI, verse 8: “and next day same as yesterday” (instead of “twill  be the same as yesterday,” in the edition of 1964). On the basis of  methodical analysis of such changes in the second edition, made  in 30 percent of the selected 213 lines, Tarvi expresses her justified  doubts at Dolinin’s idea of ostranenie as the reason for Nabokov’s  syntactical “quaintness.” One might add that Nabokov’s reference  in the “Translator’s Introduction,” to his translation as a “crib” (i.e.  line-by-line translation) with no fake modesty or any attempt at  — 128 — </page> <page sequence="44"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” self-deprecation, is a mere statement of what was for him fact. Tarvi,  however, goes on to formulate a bold hypothesis of Nabokov’s  “stikhoProza” (“versoProse”) and Pushkin’s “prozoStikhi”  (“prosoVerse”). The essence of this hypothesis is that Nabokov  created a translation of Eugene Onegin that came remarkably close  to Pushkin’s prose. Comparing Nabokov’s translation of stanza  XXVIII of Canto I, written down in continuo, to a fragment of  Pushkin’s prose, she points out striking affinities in their syntax and  style.186 Thus the empirical impression of “truth” and “harmony”  of the translation might actually turn out to be confirmed by the  optimal approximation to the “source” text (or the “next best  thing,” as metonymical contiguity, once again, suggests), in this  case, Pushkin’s own prose.  This interesting hypothesis is especially significant in light of  Mikhail Lotman’s analysis of Nabokov’s technique in The Gift.187  Discussing the place and role of poetry in The Gift, Lotman states  the following: the most fundamental problem of studies of verse  and versification is the problem of defining what verse is.188 One of  the experiments Nabokov conducts in The Gift is testing whether  the reader is capable of detecting verse that is not graphically  “highlighted” as such in the stream of prose. Lotman says that  the abundance of seemingly “accidental” iambic passages is  suspect in Nabokov’s case. The confirmation for these passges  not being accidental is Nabokov’s own conclusion that the iambic  passages within Pushkin’s prose texts are intentional as a designing  principle: “Uchas metkosti slov i predelnoi chistote ikh sochetaniia,  on dovodil prozrachnost prozy do iamba i zatem preodoleval  ego”189 (“Learning precision of words and extreme purity of their  combination, he carried the transparency of prose to iambic [meter]  and then transcended it”).190 One of Nabokov’s goals, concludes  Lotman, is to overcome the linear juxtaposition of prose and  verse: prose text includes clear fragments of rhymed verse, then  metamorphs again into prose or unrhymed verse (at one point in  The Gift, a mock reference to the stratagems of Andrei Bely’s metric  prose, his “cabbage hexameter,” underscores the notion that all  these complex arrangements are also a conscious design on the part  of Nabokov).191  — 129 — </page> <page sequence="45"> C h a p t e r  2 The other aspect of Gasparov’s article on bukvalizm discussed  above is why Briusov was doing what he was doing; that is, the  theoretical premises of literalism. In Gasparov’s formulation, all  significant events in culture can be characterized by something that  they have in common (insofar as they are the product of human  creation) and something individual (insofar as they differ in terms  of their time, place, and civilization).192 The young Briusov, creating  a pantheon of great personalities and heroes in the poems of his early  collections, underscores the common element all cultures share.  This vision is also reflected in his “Fialki v tigle” (“The Violets in the  Crucible”), a relatively early article on literary translation, in which  Briusov insists on being true to the whole of the meaning of the  original at the expense of being true to the letter of translation. In the  years of the first Russian revolution, Briusov’s faith in the supreme  unity of culture was dealt a severe blow, and Briusov was compelled  to perceive, almost physically, that he and his contemporaries  were standing on the fault line of two cultures, one dying and the  other, alien and incomprehensible, that was yet to come, that of the  “coming Huns.”193 His “The Coming Huns,” a poem written at that  time, spoke of the death of culture and the savage rejuvenation of  the world. As Gasparov puts it, Briusov’s understanding was now  that of individual civilizations replacing one another but not as heirs  to their predecessors, unable to appreciate or assess one another,  just like the European culture and what was to come in its stead.194  “Rejection of the theory of progress and transition to the theory of  civilizations, closed onto themselves,”195 are symptomatic of the  time and are later theoretically summed up by Oswald Spengler.  Thus, when Briusov in the 1910s writes his “Roman novels,”  such as The Altar of Victory, he fills them with exotic archeological  details and lexical Latinisms. His translations from the Romans  also strive for the “distancing effect”: the reader had to be aware  at every given moment that he or she was dealing with a text from  a foreign and distant culture.196 Briusov’s principles of translation  are best summed up in his article on the translations of the Aeneid:  “Perevod . . . dolzhen byt prigoden i dlia tsitat po nemu” (literally,  “Translation . . . should be also usable for the purpose of drawing  quotations [of the original] from it”).197 In other words, if one  — 130 — </page> <page sequence="46"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” were translating, for example, an English novel and encountered  a quote from Shakespeare in it, one’s first impulse would be to go  to the accepted and established translation of Shakespeare for the  translation of the quote. However, the existing translation might not  necessarily be helpful for this purpose: the principles of translation  of a short quote and a whole play are different (because the “length  of context” is different) and the particular meaning in the quote  might have been sacrificed in the process. Thus the approach  Briusov advocated in his translation of the Aeneid was to create  a source of “giant quotations” of sorts.198  One might argue that Nabokov’s Onegin, as a translation  devised in the process of teaching (hence the need for accurate  quoting), might have shared Briusov’s reasons for the shortening  of the “length of context” to the individual line, thus constructing  Onegin as a source for giant quotations. However, given Nabokov’s  ill disposition towards utilitarianism, one would reasonably doubt  that this was the whole story. For all the reasons analyzed before,  one might suspect that the less utilitarian, more metaphysical source  of Nabokov’s literalism is closer to what Anna Akhmatova meant  when she wrote: “And perhaps Poetry itself / is one magnificent  quotation.”199 It is possible to conceive an inversion of Nabokov’s  formula of carrying prose to the iambic meter and transcending it,  used in The Gift and discussed earlier—his recipe for the creation  of ideal prose, which is, of course, Pushkin’s “harmonious” prose.  Such inversion might help to capture the nature of Nabokov’s  translation of Onegin. Going in reverse order through the steps  of the formula, one transcends mimicry (“wondrous likeness of  difference,” which Nabokov, an ardent anti-Darwinist, always  understood as a “non-utilitarian” and thus artistic gift) on the  way to complete metamorphosis (the complete internal affinity of  the unlike, a “metaphysical gift”).200 This process, from mimicry  to metamorphosis, shows mechanisms of concealed design and  patterns of signification, strikingly similar to those of Pale Fire—the  metaphorical tension within the metonymical (allegorical) model of  the triad, Poem-Commentary-Index, as a whole. </page> <page sequence="47"> C h a p t e r  2 N O T E S                                                                                                                                            1 A part of this chapter was published as an article as Julia Trubikhina,  “Metaphysical ‘Affinity of the Unlike’: Strategies of Nabokov’s Literalism,”  Intertexts, Special Nabokov Issue, 12/1 (2008): 55-72. 2 “Do you not understand that we are worms,/ each born to form the angelic  butterfly...” Dante Alighieri, trans.

The Blokian formula from his drama “The Rose and  the Cross,” “radost-stradane” (joy-suffering) and, as noted M. Malikova, the  repeated sound formation of “dar” (“gift”) become an enormous funnel of  references, sending one back to the motif of knighthood (knighthood, or  “rytsarstvo,” was underscored in all obituaries of Nabokov’s father), Blok’s  “Rytsar-Neschaste” (The Knight of Misfortune), and Briusov’s translation  of Paul Verlaine’s “Bon chevalier masqué qui chevauche en silence . . .” (1880).  See M. Malikova, “Obraz Pushkina u Nabokova: Neskolko nabliudenii,” in  A. S. Pushkin and V. V. Nabokov: Sbornik dokladov mezhdunarodnoi konferentsii  15-18 aprelia 1999 g. (St. Petersburg: Dorn, 1999), 257-258. The latter text,  very different from its original, also calls the “chevalier” the Knight of  Misfortune and ends thus: “. . . kak vsiakii, kto vidit videne, s kem iavno  beseduet Bog” (“as any one who is seeing a vision and with whom God is  openly conversing”) (cited in Malikova, 258). For any Russian poet, the final  destination of any such reference of the explicit conversation with God is  Pushkin’s “The Prophet” (1826). Nabokov’s poem “On the Death of A. Blok”  calls Pushkin “a rainbow over the entire earth” (cited in A. S. Pushkin and  V. V. Nabokov, 79). — 134 — </page> <page sequence="50"> T h e  N o v e l  o n  Tr a n s l a t i o n  a n d  “ ü b e r -Tr a n s l a t i o n ” 53 Boyd, Nabokov’s Pale Fire, 182; see also 169. 54 Pale Fire, Poem, lines 136-138. 55 Boyd, Nabokov’s Pale Fire, 186-187. 56 Ibid., 187. 57 Ibid. 58 Barabtarlo, Aerial View, 207. 59 See note 52. 60 Pale Fire, Commentary, 347.189. 61 The Nabokovian is the twice-yearly publication of the International Vladimir  Nabokov Society featuring news of the field, annual Nabokov bibliography,  annotations to Nabokov’s works, abstracts, books, dissertations, photographs,  illustrations, notes, and queries.

Some time later, he  reads a story of “a Mrs. Z” in a magazine, in which she describes her “beyond  the veil” experience as also featuring a white fountain. This prompts Shade  to seek her out only to learn that the article about her experience contained  a misprint: it was a “mountain, not fountain.

I am thankful to Vera Proskurina’s article, which prevented me from being  “duped” by this touching autobiographical detail in Nabokov’s Commentary.

Nabokov’s  understanding of “fidelity” does not necessarily extend to “others.” 151 Eugene Onegin, Volume 2, 355. 152 Pale Fire, Index, 311. 153 Eugene Onegin, Volume 2, 378. 154 A similar idea was expressed by A.

Khodasevich’s poem “Peterburg” (“Petersburg,” 1925), much admired by  Nabokov, provides an indirect confirmation of the use of Russian prose as  the designing principle for verse. Khodasevich writes about his major poetic  achievement: “And, driving each verse through prose,/ uprooting my every line,/  I succeeded in grafting the classical rose/ onto the Soviet wilding” (The italics  are mine.) The Russian original reads as follows:  I kazhdyi stikh gonia skvoz prozu, Vyvikhivaia kazhduiu stroku, Privil-taki klassicheskuiu rozu  K sovetskomu dichku. 191 Lotman, “A ta zvezda nad Pulkovym...: zametki o poezii i stikhoslozhenii  V.
