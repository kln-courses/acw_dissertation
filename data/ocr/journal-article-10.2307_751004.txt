<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO NOTES ON DIEGO DA SAGREDO I: THE CORNICE AND THE FACE For D.M.L. &amp; G.D.L. This Note presents three manifestations of the idea in architectural theory that the contours of a cornice can be made to resemble a face in profile. The Cornice and Face motif can be taken not only as a commonplace of the psychology of visual perception, whereby human beings constantly read faces into things; but also as part of the realization of the theory that buildings should reflect the perfect proportions of Man made in God's image. This type of anthropomorphism was taken up with particular enthusiasm in the Renaissance'-incidentally supplying a suit- able descriptive terminology for architectural members. (The names of the parts of the body could be, and were, adapted for architecture.) The first example of the motif appears in the margin of Francesco di Giorgio's Trattati on fol. 37, which is part of the fourth book on temples2 (P1. 2ia). Following a discussion of mouldings to be used in the cornice, Fran- cesco tells us how he has sometimes tried to imagine how its symmetry and proportion can be related to the human head. He has even seen some forms of cornice, which although in their elements can be seen to be similar (to the head), proportion cannot be found in them, however much they are measured: but having measured very many other cornices I have found plenty which do have the proportion of the head, as the illustra- tion shows. That is, with the epistyle in place of the chest, the zoforo or frieze at the throat, the astragal at the chin, the denti- culi at the teeth, the echinus or ovolo at the nose, the crown or gocciolatoio in place of the forehead and eyebrows and lastly the gola or cyma at the crown of the head.3 Opposite this text is an illustration of Fran- cesco's point. A human bust is drawn in over the cross-section of a complete entablature. The head is in alignment with the cornice, the neck with the frieze and the shoulders and upper chest with the epistyle. The termin- ology outlined in the text appears on the drawing as a series of explanatory labels. The style of the drawing itself is directly related to its particular pedagogic function; the strange expression on the face of the figure is necessi- tated by its having to have its mouth open enough to expose its teeth opposite the legend denticulo. In his chapter on the cornice in Medidas del Romano (1526) Diego da Sagredo lists the various mouldings to be used4 and includes two illustrations on the cornice and face motif. They vary according to the edition con- cerned (P1. 21b-d) although, of each pair, one is always of the type of Francesco di Giorgio and the other is always Sagredo's own. The difference lies in the fact that the first illustration of the motif in each case has the human face looking in the same direction as the edge of the cornice itself. The align- ment between the two is suggested rather than stated. The second type of illustration, which is generally more decorative and imaginative, has the face and the cornice profile pointing in opposite directions. The details of the mouldings are brought out to 1 Most scholarship of the post-Wittkower era covers this aspect. For a useful bibliography see S.

The first over the forehead, the second over the eyes, the third for the nostrils, the fourth over the mouth, the fifth on the chin.6 The third example, by Bernini, has no text and demonstrates the existence of the idea only through the juxtaposition of motifs on a sheet of drawings (P1. 2Ie).7 In the centre of the sheet are three human faces drawn in profile. That on the left has a group of four parallel lines extending from the eyes, the bridge of the nose and the upper lip. The sig- nificance of these lines is made clear only by reference to the top of the page where the pro- file of a cornice appears. Or is it a face without the physiognomic characteristics drawn in? Certainly, having the other faces on the same sheet leaves one in some doubt. What seems to make identification of the little sketch easier is surely the angle at which it is drawn. Were it a face the image would not have been terminated by a straight line running parallel with the top of the page, a line which represents the very top level of the architec- tural construction of which the cornice is only a part. So it is an architectural element, albeit rather an eccentric one, and not a human face. What makes it appear strange is the artist's attempt to include the nose in the scheme, so overtly that the architectural integrity of the design is thrown out of key. Bernini obviously felt much the same way, as the drawing shows signs of correction at this point, or at least a desire to supply some alternative. In many ways, then, Bernini's is the most advanced example of the cornice and face motif we have seen, although at first sight it may seem the crudest. In addition, the presence of this solitary study at the top of the page helps explain the lines coming out of the face of the man further down. These represent the decorative moulding bands which both Francesco di Giorgio and Diego da Sagredo illustrate and name. The latter shows them in the same places as Bernini, but this is not to suggest that Bernini followed Sagredo rather than Francesco. He probably knew neither, although the close relationship between the representations of the motif in Sagredo and Francesco di Giorgio is surely not coincidental.8 However, such con- nections are of less interest than the fact that Bernini's interpretation completes the series because it fails to be explicit. Given the fact that this page of drawings represents only the development of the idea in the artist's mind (whereas the other two examples are worked- out, complete and even published) the presence of the motif in Bernini's work does seem to represent the way in which artists of the post-Renaissance period were not pre- pared to tolerate pictorial transformations of abstract notions if these turned out to be artistically limiting. Bernini is prepared to put the practical application of the philo- sophy to an acid, artistic test. His drawing is the only one of the three which attempts to show the face and the cornice with a single line. To some extent the earlier representa- tions avoid this issue, yet Bernini's rejection of their approach is doomed to failure, in their terms, from the very start. It is a good example of the value of knowing as much about an artist's failures as about his successes. NIGEL LLEWELLYN Warburg Institute 5 See, for example, illustrations in R.

Diss, 1975.</page><page sequence="3">294 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS II: THE BALUSTER AND THE POMEGRANATE Diego da Sagredo's Medidas del Romano* fits neatly within European architectural theory. The essential models for style and content are Vitruvius and Alberti, but Sagredo breaks new ground in several respects.1 One detail, symptomatic of the role that Sagredo hoped his book would play in acquainting Spaniards with current trends in classicising Italianate architecture, is his treatment of the baluster column.2 This minor decorative feature-post-classical and thus not found in Vitruvius-was given only passing treatment elsewhere in Renaissance theory. But Sagredo raises the baluster almost to the level of the other members of the Vitruvian canon, and treats it as a form especially suitable for Spain. To a certain extent this is only the recognition of archi- tectural fact, for balusters appear on Spanish buildings well before the publication of Medidas del Romano; but Sagredo gives the form theoretical justification in the tradition of Alberti and so undoubtedly plays some role in its adoption and development. This note seeks to present his reasons for so doing. Medidas del Romano is a dialogue between Tampeso and Picardo.3 The second day of discussion starts with 'columns called mon- strous, candelabra and balusters', a topic inserted at the insistence of Picardo and apparently not originally planned by Tam- peso who points out that the exclusion of these columns from Vitruvius is reason enough for their omission from Medidas. Picardo retorts that the form is, however, found in ancient buildings and thus constitutes a valid topic.4 Tampeso has to agree: Well, it is true that in these buildings there is a great variety of ornaments which are put there more for adornment than out of necessity, without them having any (strictly) determined measurement, as are the columns that are called monstrous, candelabra etc.5 Picardo has become interested in the baluster through contact with a workshop, an episode unique in Medidas. He has visited it, desiring to see for himself what Tampeso has already taught him. The studio of the rejero Crist6bal de Andino gives him the chance to measure Tampeso's theories against artefacts. Andino is mentioned earlier in the book as an artist who adheres to the ancient modular system, the virtues of which Tam- peso also preaches: Fine craftsmen and those who want their works to have authority and avoid blame, try to be governed by the ancient measure- ments, as you have seen with Cristobal de Andino, through which his works are more attractive and elegant than any others which I have seen until now.6 The use of such a method can in addition bring patronage and fame 'as can be seen in * Some of the work for this section was done for an M.Phil. dissertation at the Warburg Institute in I975 'Diego da Sagredo's Medidas del Romano and the Vitruvian Tradition' (hereafter Diss.). Sagredo's book was published at Toledo in 1526. 1 These are almost the only sources quoted by Sagredo and are the dominant influences in his architectural theory. Medidas is the first Spanish book published on any aspect of art theory and indeed one of the first in any language except Latin and Italian. Vitruvius and Alberti have approximately 56,ooo and Ioo,ooo words respectively as against Sagredo's 24,000 in its original (shorter) form, and Sagredo restricts himself to architectural theory relevant to the arts of design or, in Vitruvian terms, orthographia, as against icihnographia and scaenographia as subsections of dispositio. 2 For Sagredo's statement of his objectives see Diss., PP. 7ff. 3Tampeso should almost certainly be taken as Sagredo himself because of his role as teacher and through isolation of the vowels in both names thus-- TAMPESO = .A..E.O - SAGREDO. His pupil in the dialogue is Le6n Picardo, a French painter. See Diss., p. 67 and below. For Picardo, see Thieme- Becker, Kiinstlerlexikon, xxvi, p. 576. 4 The edition used here is Lisbon 1541; see Diss., pp. 8o-2 for the bibliographical history of Medidas. The text used is to all extents and purposes that of the first (1526) edition, except for an additional section which appears in editions only from c. 1530 onwards. On this additional section, see Diss., pp. 84-85. For the section on balusters, 'colunas dichas monstruosas, condeleros [sic] y balaustres' see Medidas, fol. bviiiv 1. 1o. My translation 'monstrous' should have the sense of fantastic or resulting from mutation rather than just over-sized. On the exclusion from Vitruvius, loc. cit., line 29: 'Como quiera que los antiguos: no hazen mencion en sus libros destos balaustres: no te mara- villes si yo no aya tocado su formacion'. For Picardo's retort, loc. cit., line 31. 5 loc. cit., line 34: 'Assi es verdad que enlos edificios ay mucha diversidad de ornamentos que se ponen mas por atavio que por necessidad sin tener medida (fol. CirI) determinada: como son colunas que se dizen monstruosas, candeleros.. .' 6 ibid., Bviiir27: 'Los buenos oficiales y los que dessean que sus obras tengan autoridad y carezcan de reprehension: procuran de regir so por las medidas antiguas como haze tu vezino Cristoval de Andino: por donde sus obras son mas venustas y elegantes que ningunas otras que hasta agora yo aya visto'.</page><page sequence="4">DIEGO DA SAGREDO 295 the reja that he made for your master the Constable'.' Picardo's visit to Andino's workshop has reinforced his knowledge of the other orders but he is confused by the baluster form. It does not fit in with what Tampeso has already told him: and among the columns, both square and round, that were there, I saw one of such a strange formation that it was not possible to make out whether it was Doric or Ionic, still less Tuscan. I asked what they called it and they replied that it was called the baluster.8 Both Picardo and Tampeso agree that the whole formal group constitutes a 'type' (genero) of column but they never state cate- gorically that it corresponds to an 'order' in the modern sense. Even so, the earlier parts of Medidas do not use the word orden and the accepted categories of columns are all described as 'types'.9 Picardo seems to imply that he took the baluster form to correspond to one of these categories. It therefore seems likely that the baluster form was considered an 'order' on the same terms as Doric, Ionic and Tuscan except for the vital fact that it is missing from Vitruvius.1o Yet such an omission was not an insuper- able problem to sixteenth-century theorists. In general they were happy to explain and add to the notoriously uncertain text of Vitruvius especially on matters of termino- logy. But Sagredo would have been keen to find some literary substantiation for his interest in balusters, and for maximum respectability this would have to be Italian. The illustrations of the baluster in Francesco di Giorgio's treatise would doubtless have appealed to him but there is no sure way of telling exactly where he looked." We cannot make too great a claim for the appearance of the baluster in Medidas as an independent columnar form; Sagredo was not yet present- ing a rationalized system of the orders as Serlio would do a decade later, although he was moving in this direction.12 Balusters, as a formal group, are broadly divided in Medidas into two types. These are (A) the baluster column; and (B) the candelabrum form: or rather (A) the baluster as a column; and (B) the candela- brum which happens to be a baluster. Each is given an etymology and has its decorative features described. Although Sagredo never says as much, the distinction he makes in function between the two is that of an applied and a free-standing form of column-pre- sumably decorative and structural forms respectively. Tampeso explains that the baluster form appears in several composite variations and that the Greeks used the word baricephala (heavy-headed) to describe it. This word is, in fact, used in Vitruvius (iii, 3) but in a metaphorical sense only: et ipsarum aedium species sunt varicae barycephalae humiles latae ornanturque signis fictilibus aut aereis inauratis earum fastigia tuscanico more, uti est ad Circum Maximum Cereris et Herculis Pompeiani, item Capitoli. It is thus difficult to know what source, if any, Sagredo was using here. Tampeso now discards his Greek word and outlines a differ- ent etymology, from the word balaustium, that is the flower of the pomegranate tree; a Latin word which appears in one of Sagredo's more common sources, Pliny's Natural History :13 SThis is a reference to the work done for the Constable's Chapel of Burgos Cathedral. Founded in 1482 by the then holder of the office, Pedro Fernandez de Velasco, it was finished in about 1532 and contains work by many of the great names of the period, such as Simon de Colonia, Felipe Biguerny and both the Siloees. See Medidas, loc. cit., line 34, 'sino veelo por essa rexa que labra para tu sefior el (fol. Bviiiv) Condestable'. 8 loc. cit., line 23, 'y entre las colunas que avia quadradas y redondas: vi unas de tan estrafia forma- cion que no pude discernir si eran doricas, o jonicas, ni menos tuscanicas. Pregunte como se llamavan: fue me respondido que balaustres'. 9 Compare Medidas, fol. BviirI5 with the sections on intercolumniation e.g. fol. Eviv3 and fol. Eviir9g. See Diss., pp. 84-85 for this additional section of the text which appears in the later editions with some different terminology including orden. 10 Cf. above, p. 294. In 'The stylistic term "Plateresque" ', this Journal, XXXIX, 1976, J. B. Bury points out that an early illustrator of the text of Vitruvius, Fra Giocondo, misunderstood the classical text in his anxiety for antique authority for the baluster; see Vitruvius, De Architectura, ed. Giocondo, Venice 15i1 , fol. 26r and Bury, art. cit., p. 215 n. 56. xx Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Trattato in Codex Torinese-Saluzziano, 48, fol. 15r; ed. C. Maltese, vol. i, Milan 1967, tav. 25. For other reasons it seems that Sagredo knew Francesco's text; see Diss., pp. 14, 43, 59, 75n9 et al. 12 Although Sagredo is the first author to organize the 'orders' systematically, the word seems to appear first in the celebrated letter to Pope Leo X on the antiquities of Rome; for example in D. Francesconi, Discorso letto alla reale Accademia fiorentina: (Congettura che una lettera creduta di Baldessar Castiglione sia di Raffaello d'Urbino, Florence 1799, p. 61. 13 Pliny, Hist.

Other ancient sources are Columella on husbandry, Scri- bonius Largus the physician and P. Vegetius.15 We shall return to the pomegranate after pursuing Sagredo's comments on the baluster's form and function. Previous theoretical discussion of the baluster had been confused, scanty and generally unimportant for Sagredo.16 He may have seen the illustrations to Francesco di Giorgio, which at one point in the manu- script text show both a baluster and a tripodal balustered candelabrum opposite a passage dealing with columnar theory, which Sagredo seems to have known.'7 In addition the Codex Barberini, the celebrated late fifteenth century book of drawings, for instance, shows a similar candelabrum among the remains of classical antiquity as well as examples from Early Christian Rome, which for Sagredo as for the Italians would have seemed authen- tically a lo romano.18 In his keenness to attach to the baluster column an academic apparatus Segrado treats it as seriously and extensively as he does the Vitruvian orders. For the single version of the baluster column he prescribes: small compartments, antique vases, vari- ously formed, carved and clothed in foliage, and other fantastic carvings placed the one over the other, and on top of everything they place the baluster, which is no less decked out, the belly with its antique leaves and the neck with its grooves or with other carvings that happen to fit in ... they have to ensure the tapering that eases off towards the neck from the pedestal and that they are not left more slender than the throat of the baluster. ... The moulding at the top of the capital is the same as is formed in columns ...19 (P1. 22a). And again for the double version of the baluster: There are other balusters ... composed of two similar baricephalae equal in length, width, mouldings and all the other carved decoration, which are stuck base to base. This type of baluster is more tapered, elegant, wider in the neck and more extended, following the arrangement of the place where they are required. When formed of stone they are stouter than when of wood and when of wood, stouter than when of metal. The top is not larger than the bottom, nor the bottom than the top, both ends are of the same design and shape. It should be ensured in the design that the waisting of the shaft at the centre is not more slender than that at the top, and that the mouldings that they put at the top, project neither more nor less than the bellies.20 (P1. 22c). The other important form in which the 14 Loc. cit., line 7: 'de donde por su mucha semejanga fue dicho balaustre'. 15 The source mentioned from Pliny is at XIII. xix. 34-113: 'sed circa Carthaginem Punicum malum cognomine sibi vindicat; aliqui granatum appellant. horum quinque species: dulcia, acria, mixta, acida, vinosa; Samia et Aegyptia distinguntur etc . . . flos balaustium vocatur, et medicis idoneus et tinguendis vestibus, quarum color inde nomen accepit.'

Sagredo says that this can be made of such a variety of forms that he, through Tampeso, can supply rules only for their bases: Only with the base is there any firm ruling, for the ancients mostly made this triangular, and they took for the top, two-sevenths of the length of the whole candelabra and this much again for the bottom.21 (P1. 22b). As with the baluster as a column, care has to be taken over the waisting, and the details are demonstrated in illustrations of whose value Sagredo is convinced. For example, Tampeso says, again of the base: They sculpt and carve on the other corners of this base griffin's feet, the claws of lions and hounds and other ferocious beasts, for which reason I think it is more beneficial for you to be looking than listening to me.22 The original function of the balustered candelabrum was, we are told, religious, for on top were 'burnt certain oils and gums'.23 The discussion then moves on to debate the relative merits of the candelabra bases, Picardo maintaining a healthy scepticism about Tampeso's use of number symbolism to demonstrate the superiority of the tripodal version. Picardo prefers the craftsman's practical approach : However, I believe that they (tripodal bases) were used more in order to secure the base than to show any kinship between the Gods and the candelabra. ... For the best stand has three feet rather than four.24 In the wider context it seems that Sagredo's representative craftsman, Picardo, has only a certain toleration level when it comes to symbolical interference in architectural de- sign. He seems to accept the role of the pomegranate in the baluster (etymology) but he gets restless about the gods in their bases (symbolism). This tells us something not only about artisan scepticism in Renaissance Spain but also about the special place of the pomegranate. The symbolic significance for Spain of the pomegranate fruit or flower would not have been lost on any of Sagredo's contemporaries, and the root of the matter lies in etymology. The Spanish word for the pomegranate tree is close to that of other romance languages: granado. The fruit is granada; and the con- quest of the southern kingdom of Granada in 1492 was the final step towards the unifica- tion of the peninsula under Ferdinand and Isabella. Sagredo's book is a result of the movement whereby, after the conquest, the intellectual centre of Spain in Castille felt secure enough to turn towards Europe and was no longer quite so isolated at the heart of its peninsula. The city of Granada itself was to contain the new national mausoleum of the Reyes Catolicos,25 and the pomegranate fruit was adopted as a new emblem for the pro- vince using the straightforward etymological equivalence (granada and Granada).26 Sagredo's derivation of the baluster and the role of Granada bring us back to the pomegranate itself. The pomegranate sym- bolism we are considering is distinct from that of Christian iconography, where the fruit is a x1 idem., fol. Civ9: 'Solamente se tiene cuenta con la basa: la qual los antiguos por la mayor parte formavan triangular: &amp; tomava en alto las dos septimas partes del largo de todo el candelero, y otro tanto enel assiento'. 22 idem., fol. CiirI: 'Enlos cantones otrosi desta basa se esculpen y forman: pies de grifos: garras de leones y de mastines, y de otras bestias muy feroces: por tanto creeme que mas te aprovecharas veyendolo que oyendome'. 28 idem., fol.

In fact it seems that antique sacrificial altars were hardly ever tripodal or triangular. I am grateful to John Onians for pointing out the triangular altar in Raphael's cartoon for the tapestry scene of St. Paul at Lystra. 25 See Earl Rosenthal, 'El primer contrato de la capilla real', in Cuadernos de Arte, xi, 21, 1972, Pp. 9ff. and Carl Justi, Miscellaneen aus drei Jahrhunderten spanischen Kunstlebens, vol. i, Berlin 1908, especially the chapters on 'Bartolome Ordofiez und die K6nigs- graiber zu Granada', pp. 83ff. and 'Die Einffihrung der Renaissance in Granada', pp. 215ff. 26 For more pomegranate symbolism see Earl Rosen- thal, The Cathedral of Granada, Princeton 1961, pp. 117 and I63. The fruit was also chosen as the symbol for the Kingdom of New Granada, that is Colombia. Here, for example, is a reference to the seal of Bogotd in 1548 . . . 'una cedula despachada el viente y tres de Diciembre, le (i.e. the king) dio a la dicha ciudad de Santa Fe de este Reino como cabeza d61, por armas a la aguila imperial en campo colorado, y por orla del escudo nueve granadas'. See Pedro Simon, Noticias historiales de las conquistas de Tierra Firme en las Indias Occidentales (c. 1625), vol. i, Bogota 1953, p. 263. The popularity of balusters in colonial architecture in South America is stressed by San Sebastian in his introduction to a reprint of Medidas, Cali (Colombia) 1967, pp. xivff., and he seems to imply the likelihood of Sagredo's involvement in the movement. 20</page><page sequence="7">298 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS symbol of fecundity, charity and hope.27 Even so the miraculous image of Nuestra Sentora de la Antigua, carried at the last siege of Granada, did hold a pomegranate which must have taken on a special significance through the etymological link with the city. The symbolic role of the pomegranate in early Jewish scripture seems to have been restricted to liturgical apparatuses.28 In I Kings, vii: 18 the plans of Hiram of Tyre for the Temple of Solomon include 200 pomegranates set in rows over the capitals.29 The pomegranate's particular attraction was its capacity to represent fecundity. The outer shell is but a container for the huge number of seeds within and it is often portrayed ripe for bursting. Etymology applies once more with the latin granum (seed) as the root of the name of the plant. In the context of Habsburg Granada the image was not unexpectedly also made to represent the multitudinous cells of the Empire all con- tained within the Habsburg shell. Many of these aspects of pomegranate symbolism are explicitly brought out in Ludovicus Nonius's (Luis Nufiez) Hispania, where the author, dealing with Granada, comes to the origin of its name.30 He too follows the etymological path and describes the pomegranate in the same terms as Pliny, Sagredo's source, referring to it as malum punicum. He finds an additional reason for the choice of this fruit, beyond its copious proliferation in the region; for Nuiiez draws a parallel between the density of the housing in the city and the way seeds spill out. This image of the over-ripe fruit with its overflowing crop we shall find in other Habsburg connections (P1. 22e). Nufiez finally tells of the special place of the emblem in the hearts of the city's inhabitants. The whole passage reads: Urbs autem nova est Poenorum colonia, quam ita dictam volunt nonnulli a Cocco, quem Hispani Granam vocant, qui insigni copia in hoc regno legitur; alii ver6b mali punici similitudine, quod &amp; Granata dicitur. Nam ut illud est granosum, &amp; densissimis acinis refertum, sic &amp; urbs haec, dehiscentis granati in modum, confertissimas aedes habet: adde, incolas pro avitis insignibus mala punica gestare, quo nominis etymon referrent.31 The origin of Granada's name is apparently still obscure. It has been described in the tradition of Nufiez-though perhaps not with any great certainty-as deriving from the word for pomegranate in allusion to the number of pomegranate trees in the neigh- bourhood. With the testimony of Nufiez, there is no doubt of the commonly-held con- viction of the sixteenth century that is important. The derivation may, in fact, be etymo- logically related, but this time involving stone and colour. The Penibetic Mountain range which separates Andalusia from the fertile coastal strip is largely made up of coarse-grained and granular crystalline sub- stances, both igneous and sedimentary, such as marble and more particularly granite.32 In Spanish the latter, granates, are usually considered to be stones of a reddish colour, and the word shares the same stem as granada or perhaps Granada.33 The Arab 27 See M. Trens, Maria, Madrid 1946, p. 564- 28 As, for example, in Exodus xxviii:33, where the Lord's directions for the robes of Aaron and his fellow priests include decorative pomegranates of many colours. 29 The text runs: 'Et perfecit columnas, et duos ordines per circuitum retiaculorum singulorum, ut tegerent capitella quae erant super summitatem, malogranatorum: eodem modo fecit et capitello secundo'. The prophet Jeremiah makes the same point (lii, 22-23): 'similiter columnae secundae, et malo- granata'. Although there seems no consistent ruling on the matter, it is possible to find examples of scenes of the Temple of Jerusalem, in these cases all of the Presentation of the Virgin, with prominent balusters dating from c. I520, e.g. Antwerp Museum no. 988, and another in Nuremberg attributed to the School of Diurer. A Spanish example by the Master of Sijena (London, Private Collection) is particularly floral. Perhaps the most interesting speculation must surround the view of the Temple gate illustrated in Luca Pacioli's Divina Proportione, Venice 1509, which includes an unusual series of double balusters. It might easily be the case that the ambiguities of the Biblical descrip- tion of the two rows of columns with pomegranates at their 'heads' serves as a foundation for the double baluster. Both Pacioli and Sagredo as clerics with an interest in architecture might be expected to indulge in imaginative glossing of the Scriptures. 30 Hispania sive populorum, urbium, insularum ac fluminum in ea accuratior descriptio, Antwerp 1607, p. 8o. Although there seems to be some confusion this appears to be the second edition; the first cannot be very much earlier. 3a Nufiez, op. cit., pp. 8o-8i. 32 The term for pomegranate used by Pliny and later by Nufiez-malum punicum-has a connection with the colour red (see following note). There is still some debate about whether the adjectival part of the name should be related to scarlet or to Carthaginian. Nuniez tells of Granada's Punic origins. 33 The colour component of granite is regulated by the state of preservation of its felspars. Less common mineral accessories are reddish grains of sphene or pinkish garnet; and, most important here, andalusite in small pleochronic crystals. First discovered in Andalusia, this was characterized as rose-red, flesh- red, violet and reddish-brown as well as whitish and pearl-grey.</page><page sequence="8">DIEGO DA SAGREDO 299 name Al Qal'a al-Hambra refers to the ancient Moorish citadel at the city's centre which in one sense became, like Brunelleschi's dome or the Eiffel Tower, symbolic and almost synonymous with the city itself. Al'Hambra means 'Red Fort' in reference to the colour of the soil of the hill. Perhaps this dual emphasis on the colour in the Arabic word- which is certainly relevant-and in the word for reddish granite-which might be relevant -offers the key to the origin of the name. But for our purposes it is the granada, the pomegranate etymology, which is interesting. The fruit appears symbolically associated with the Habsburg family from Emperor Maximilian onwards. Maximilian carries a fruit in the famous portrait by Diurer in Vienna34 and images of the fruit surround the Emperor on the triumphal chariot called the Kleine Triumphwagen engraved by Diurer.35 The pomegranate appears once more on the bronze shields of the statues of his son Philip the Fair and the armour of the latter's wife Juana 'la Loca' in the Hofkircke at Inns- bruck where his inscription reads 'Philips Kunig-zu Castilien, Leon und Granaten'36 (P1. 23a). The separate strands of meaning of the fruit-city, family and government-are drawn together in a scene from the Entry into Brussels (1496) of that same Infanta Juana, part of the celebration for Isabella's daughter's arrival on Habsburg territory37 (P1. 23b). The King of Granada, a Moor, with pomegranates on shield and banner, is kneeling to Isabella the Catholic and sur- rendering the keys of the city. The pomegranate can also be seen in association with Emperor Charles V, King of Spain at the time of the publication of Medidas, in for example the woodcut portrait of 1518 by Hans Weiditz.38 In Granada itself the triumphal arch at the entrance from the city to the grounds of the Al'Hambra has samples of the fruit, ripe to bursting as in Nufiez, prominently displayed (P1. 22e). The etymological aspect here becomes abundantly clear; the gateway is called the Puerta de las granadas. Having passed through it on the way up to Charles's new palace, one pauses at the top of a slope at his pilar or fountain. Here again the granadas are well to the fore39 (P1. 22d). All this circumstantial evidence suggests that Sagredo,40 who wrote a book on architecture but whose profession was chap- lain to the same Queen Juana of the 1496 Brussels Entry, created his view of the baluster's derivation from the pomegranate because of its particular relevance and suit- ability for European Spain, newly united with the Kingdom of Granada and now for the first time under the dominion of an Emperor.41 At the moment of the publication of Medidas in 1526, the young Emperor Charles was establishing his Queen, Isabella of Portugal (1503-39), as Regent in Granada, and planning for her a huge Italianate palace. Pedro Machuca's new building on 34Panofsky is of the opinion that Maximilian adopted the pomegranate in his youth because it struck him as an image of himself, and quotes Stabius on the subject: see his Diirer, Princeton 1943, i, P. 178 and ii, fig. 228; also Bartsch, vii, pp. I49ff., no. 138.

The accompanying text to fol. 42r is on fol. 41v. 38 See this Journal, XXXIV, 1971, pl. 4od. 39 Charles's better-known device is the twin columns of Hercules with the legend Plus Ultra. These columns are sometimes balusters as in the example in the choir stalls of Barcelona Cathedral (1519) which show the columns, double balusters in this case, framed by balusters growing from pomegranates just as Sagredo illustrated them. See Earl Rosenthal, 'Plus ultra, .Non plus ultra and the columnar device of Emperor Charles V' in this Journal, XXXIV, 1971, p. 208, pl. 38b. 40 See Medidas, dedication. 41 The fruit is also taken as an emblem of Granada by Katherine of Aragon, married first to Prince Arthur and then to Henry VIII. Banks of roses and pome- granates appear as symbols of union at her first wedding, see H. Schneider, 'On the Pomegranate', Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.s., iv, 1945- 1946, pp. II7-2o. Having adopted the fruit, it had some bearing upon her motto 'Not for my crown'. The 'crown' of the fruit is useless and thrown away, see F. Claremont, Catherine of Aragon, London 1939, p. 65. Garrett Mattingly in Catherine of Aragon, London 1942, p. 316n2 feels there might be some additional reference to Proserpina, the pomegranate's most famous associate and that the punning reference to Granada is not the whole story. Also he points to the irony of the fecund fruit as an emblem for this lady, so tragically barren. The fruit appears on the emblem of the Spanish king Henry of Castile (I454-74) under the 'Agro dulce' motif showing the strength and mildness of kings, see A. Henkel and A. Sch6ne (eds.), Emblemata, Stuttgart 1967, col. 233.</page><page sequence="9">300 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS the Al'Hambra hill was to be in a style unique in Spain, and it represented a revolutionary imperial approach to building for that country. No-one interested in architecture in Spain in the mid-I52os would have been unaware of the significance of Sagredo's account of baluster derivation. For the writer of Medidas is linking an architectural 'order' with an acceptable classical source, with an emblem of a new Spanish era and with a natural form common in Spain. The baluster column, an alternative 'type' to the orders extracted from Vitruvius, might well seem an 'order' especially suitable in Spain; and this is of course borne out in Plateresque buildings where balusters of all shapes -and sizes proliferate.42 This is not to say that Spanish architects used balusters because they are given rules for them in Medidas. It is rather that Sagredo is trying to legitimize their inclusion in the architectural language of early Renaissance Spain. He is hoping to surround his unruly baluster with a little Vitruvian respectability but he is honest enough never to claim for it classical authen- ticity. Sagredo's partial reliance upon the rumoured high value placed upon 'invention' in antiquity would allow for creations such as the baluster and associated forms, perhaps as a type of composite order, that is an advance upon the Vitruvian canon which finishes with Corinthian. Sagredo's presentation of the baluster as something special to Spain has precedents and sequels in Renaissance architectural theory. Alberti had already demonstrated a willingness to pursue the nationalistic line by his location of true classical Composite as the 'top' order, both metaphorically and logistically (perhaps as he saw it used on the Colosseum). He places it above Corinthian, the highest Vitruvian order. For Alberti the Composite is 'Italic', to help prove Italy's superiority to Greece. Sagredo likewise is combining the best features of two orders to create a third.43 The idea of an order or type of column being particularly connected with one country occurs later in the sixteenth century too. In his 'French order' Philibert de l'Orme sought to accentuate and orna- ment the lines across the shaft where the separate stones of a column meet.44 As with Sagredo's baluster, there is never the sugges- tion that any one capital type should be used with the French column; whereas Alberti's Composite/Italic in taking the best of Ionic and Corinthian creates, or recognizes the antique creation of, an entirely new order. Sagredo's eclectic technique must surely have played a vital role in the adoption in the early sixteenth century of the baluster column and balustered candelabra in the canon of Spanish architecture. Palladio did a similar job for the baluster in Italy by using it in designs and publications as part of the classical vocabulary of like status with details from ancient buildings.45 In Spain aesthetic preference had begun the process before the publication of Medidas, but after 1526 Sagredo's literary support may help to account for the extraordinary variety, adapt- ability and perseverance of the baluster form throughout the sixteenth century-until the appearance of the Escorial heralded the revo- lutionary advent of the estilo desornamentado. Sagredo's preoccupation with the baluster indicates the lengths to which Renaissance theorists would go both to rationalize and to intellectualize originally unsophisticated ex- pressions of choice. NIGEL LLEWELLYN Warburg Institute 42 A glance at any handbook of Spanish Renaissance Architecture will demonstrate this. For example these illustrations to J.
