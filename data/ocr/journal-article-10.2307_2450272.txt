I DESIRE, in this article, to call the attention of ethnographers to some pictures which are among the most transitory in the history of human art. They are the work of the Navajo Indians, a people who make no graven images of their gods, who do not decorate skins or robes, who place no symbols on their rude and rarely-made pottery, and may be said to have no rock inscriptions. A few slightly scratched sketches on the cliffs of Arizona and New Mexico may, perhaps, be attributed to them; but the vast majority of carvings on stone in their country, and all of the most permanent character, are the work of the sedentary races. Seeing no evidence of a symbolic art among them, one might readily be led to suppose that they possessed none. Such was my opinion for two years after I had come to reside near them. Such is the opinion of many white men, who have lived for periods of from ten to twenty years among them. During my residence of nearly four years in New Mexico I had heard of these drawings through the less conservative Indians and through a Mexican who had been many years captive among them. But it was not until last November, when I made a spe- cial journey to the Navajo country under the auspices of the Bureau of Ethnology, that I obtained unrestricted access to the medicine-lodge, saw the hieratic figures drawn, and was given permission to sketch them, much to the horror of the large majority of the assembled multitude. The medicine-lodge, on the floor of which these pictures are made, is a simple conical structure of logs in the shape of an VOL. XIX.-NO.

It is about twenty-five feet in diameter at the base, internally, and about eight feet high under the apex. The only apertures are a smoke-hole above and a door, communicating through a short passage-way, in the east. The fire is built in the center of the floor except when the pictures are being, made, then it is removed further to the east to make room for them. It is so dark in the lodge that on a brief winter day the artists must begin their work before sunrise if they would finish before night-fall and this it is essential they should do. When the call is sounded in the morning, several young men go forth and bring in a quantity of dry sand in blankets; this is thrown on the floor and spread out over a surface twelve feet or more in diameter, to the depth of about thrde inches; it is leveled and made smooth by means of the broad oaken battens used in weaving. The drawings are begun as much towards the center as the design will permit, due regard being paid to the precedence of the points of the compass; the figure in the east being begun first, that in the south, second, that in the west, third, that in the north, fourth. The figures in the periphery come after these. The reason for working from within outwards is a practical one; it is that the operators may not have to step over and thus risk the safety of their finished work. While the work is in progress the chief shaman does little more than direct and criticism; a dozen or more young men per- form the manual labor, each working on a different part. These assistants have had a certain ceremony of initiation performed over them before they are admitted to the lodge or allowed to help when these pictures are made; but they need not be skilled medicine-men or even aspirants to the craft of the shaman. They get nothing for their pains but their food, which, however, is abundant. Three times a day the person, for whose benefit the dance is performed, sends in enough mush, corn-cake, soup and roasted mutton to satisfy to the utmost the appetites of all in the lodge. The shainan, or 1zatl/aui (chanter or singer), as the Nava- jos call him, gets a rich present for his services. The pictures are drawn according to an exact system, except in certain well-defined cases, where the limner is allowed to in- dulge his fancy. This is the case with the embroidered pouches the gods carry at the waist (see Plate xxxiii). Within-reasonable</page><page sequence="4">I885.] Mythic Dry-Paintings of the Navafos. 933 limits the artist may give his god as handsome a pouch as he wishes. On the other hand, some parts are measured by palms and spans, and not a line of the sacred design can be varied in them; straight and parallel lines are drawn on a tightened cord. The pigments are five in number: they are black made of char- coal; white, of white sandstone; yellow, of yellow sandstone; red, of red sandstone, and " blue," of the black and white mixed in proper proportions; all ground into fine powder between two stones. The so-called blue is, of course, gray, but it is the only inexpensive representative of the cerulean tint they can obtain, and, combined with the other colors on the sandy floor, it looks like a real blue. These colored powders are kept on improvised trays of pine bark; to apply them, the artist grasps a little in his hand and allows it to flow out between the thumb and the op- posed fingers. When he makes a mistake he does not brush away the color, he obliterates it by pouring sand on it and then draws the corrected design on the new surface. The naked forms of the mythical figures are first drawn, and then the clothing is put on. Even in the representations of the Bitses-ninez, or long bodies, which are nine feet in length, the naked body of each is first made in its appropriate color-white for the east, blue for the south, yellow for the west, black for the noyth-and then the four shirts are painted on as shown in the picture (Plate xxxiii) from thigh to axilla. It is the task of the shaman, when the work of painting is completed, to put the corn-pollen, emblem of fecundity, on the lips and breast of each divine form, and to set up the bounding plume-sticks around the picture. Then the one who gives the feast enters and is placed sitting on the form that belongs to the east-the white form-and looking eastward. Here the colored dust from various parts of the divine figures is taken and applied to corresponding parts of the patient, and many other ceremonies are performed, which it is not my purpose to relate here. When the patient has departed many of the spectators pick up the corn- pollen, now rendered doubly sacred, and put it in their medicine- bags. Some take dust from the figures on their moistened palms and apply it to their own bodies. If the devotee has disease in his legs, he takes powder from the legs of the figures; if in his head, he takes powder from the head, and so on. By the time they are all done the picture is pretty badly</page><page sequence="5">934 Mtj'hic Dry-Paintings of tie Navalos. [October, marred. Then it becomes the duty of the shaman to completely obliterate it; this he does with a slender wand, while he sings the song appropriate to this part of the ceremony. He begins with the figure belonging to the east, the white figure, and proceeds in the same order as was observed in making the picture, i. e., in accordance with the apparent daily course of the sun. The fig- ures at the margin are erased last, and when this- is being done the bounding plume-sticks are knocked down. When no sem- blance of the picture is left the assistants gather the sand in their blankets, carry it to a little distance from the lodge and throw it away. Thus in half an hour after the completion of a large pic- ture, ten or twelve feet in diameter, which has taken a dozen men, or more, eight or ten hours to construct, not a trace of it is loft. I have learned of seventeen great ceremonies of the Navajos, in which pictures of this character are drawn, and I have heard that there are, on an average, about four pictures to each dance. This would give us about sixty-eight such designs known to the medicine men of the tribe. But I learn that there are different schools or guilds among the medicine men who draw the pictures differently in some of the details, and that besides these seventeen great ceremonies there are many nMinor rites, with their appro- priate pictures; so the number of designs in the possession of the tribe is probably much greater than that which I give. The medicine-men aver that these pictures are transmitted from teacher to pupil, in each guild and for each ceremony, unaltered from year to year and from generation to generation. That such is strictly the case I cannot believe. No permanent design is pre- served for reference, and there is no final authority in the tribe. The majority of the ceremonies can be performed only during the months when the snakes are dormant. The pictures are there- fore carried over, from winter to winter, in the fallible memories of men. But I think it probable that innovations are uninten- tional, and that any changes which may occur are wrought slowly. Out of this possible number of sixty-eight or more pictures I have seen seven, colored copies of which will, I hope, appear in some future report of the Bureau of Ethnology. The majority are too intricate to be reproduced in a satisfactory manner from a wood-cut on a page of this sizes I therefore present illustrations of only two, and these of the simplest.</page><page sequence="6">PLATE XXXIII. NORTH. gal A E~~~~~~~~~~ I LIM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I Navajo Dry-paintings. The Long Bodies.</page><page sequence="7">1885.] Mythic DThy-Paintings of the Navajos. 935 The first four pictures in my collection are those of the Dsilyidje huatlcal, or chant among the mountains. This ceremony is also called ilnas/ingo 1uthal, or chant in the dark circle of branches, from the great corral of pifion boughs in which it is performed. As the public ceremonies of the last night are varied and interesting, it is best known to the whites of all Navajo dances, and by our people is commonly called the hoshkawn dance, from the partic- ular performance of the night, which seems most to strike the Caucasian fancy. The whole ceremony is propitiatory to the YKis, or gods of the mountains; but when the Navajo prophet, who learned these mys- teries, was brought around by a friendly god from place to place to be taught them, he was, on one occasion, brought into the house of the serpents. Now the worship of the snakes and water animals constitutes a separate dance, that of the ftomoni izatual, or chant of terrestrial beauty, with its own pictures and ceremonies; but to indicate that the prophet visited the snakes in his wander- ings and saw a portion of their mysteries, this picture, represent- ing the home of the serpents, is drawn (Plate xxxii). In the center of the picture is a circular concavity about six inches in diameter, intended to represent water. In all the other pictures where water was represented, a small bowl, I observed, was sunk in the ground and filled with water, which was after- wards sprinkled with powdered charcoal to give the appearance of a flat, dry surface. Closely surrounding the central depression are four parallelograms, each about four inches wide and ten inches long in the original pictures; the half nearer the center is red, the other half is blue; they are bordered with narrow lines of white. They appear in this and in some other pictures as something on which the gods seem to stand, and symbolize the salzabitlol, or raft of sunbeams, the favorite vessels on which the divine ones navigate the upper deep. Red is the color proper to sunlight in their symbolism; but red and blue together represent sunbeams in the morning and evening skies when they show an alternation of red and blue. The sunbeam shafts, the halo and the rainbow are painted in the same colors, but they differ in form- the halo is a circle; the rainbow is curved and usually anthropo- morphic, in Plate XXXIII, however, it is plumed. External to these sunbeam rafts, and represented as standing on them, are the figures of eight serpents-two in the east, white; two in the</page><page sequence="8">936 Mytlic Dry-Paintings oJ the Navcj'os. [October, south, blue; two in the west, yellow, and two in the north, black. They cross one another in pairs, forming four figures like the let- ter X. In each X the snake which appears to be beneath is made first, complete in every respect, and then the other snake is drawn over it in conformity with their realistic laws of art before referred to. The neck in all cases is blue, crossed with four bands of red, which, in the snake-like forms run diagonally, but in the man-like forms to be seen in other pictures, run transversely. The V-shaped marks on the backs of the snakes represent mot- tlings; the four marks at the end of each tail are for rattles. Ex- ternal to these eight snakes are four more of much greater length but colored to correspond with those already described. They seem to follow one another around the picture in the direction of the sun's apparent course, and form a frame or boundary. In the north-east is seen one of the Yeis, who accompanied the Navajo prophet to the home of the snakes. In the extreme west is a black circular figure representing the mountain of Dsilya-i/lzin, whence they descended to visit the snakes. In the original picture the mountain was in relief-which I have not attempted to con- vey in my copy-a little mound of sand about ten or twelve inches high. From the summit of the mountain to the middle of the central waters is drawn a wide line in corn meal with four footprints depicted at intervals; this represents the track of the bear. Immediately south of the track is the figure of an animal drawn in the gray pigment, this is the grizzly himself, symboliz- ing the prophet. During the journeys of the Navajo prophet before referred to, he came one night in the Carrizo mountains to the home of the four bear-gods (so runs the legend). They took from one corner of their cave a great sheet of cloud, unrolled it and exhibited to his view a picture. They told him that this picture must be drawn by the Navajos in their ceremonies; but as men had not the power of handling the clouds they should draw it on sand. This picture, a very elaborate one, not illustrated in this article, represents the Yeis of the cultivated plants. It shows the central waters and the sunbeam rafts as in the first picture. It has four anthropomorphic figures extending from the center to different points of the compass, and highly conventionalized representa- tions of the four principal domestic plants of the Indians-corn, bean, pumpkin and tobacco. The whole is surrounded on three</page><page sequence="9">I 885.] Mythic Dry-Paintings of t/le Navajos. 937 sides by the anthropomorphic rainbow. The body of the eastern god is white; that of the southern, blue; that of the western, yel- low; that of the northern, black. Here is an appropriate occasion to speak of Navajo symbol- ism in color. In all cases, as far as I could learn, the south is represented by blue, the west by yellow, the upper world by blue, the lower world by black and white in spots. Usually the east is represented by white and the north by black; but some- times these colors are interchanged and the north becomes white while the east is black. The reasons for this change are too lengthy to be discussed here. It is related in the myth which accounts for these mysteries, that this Navajo prophet, Dzil'-yi-neyadni, or Reared among the Moun- tains, was once led by the gods to a dwelling called the Lodge of Dew; it was built of dew-drops, and the door was made of many plants of different kinds. They entered and found four goddesses called Bitses-ninez or long bodies. The holy ones rose as the strangers entered, and they were very tall. The plumes on their heads almost touched the sky. They said to the prophet: " In the rites that you will teach your people when you return to them, you will invoke us by drawing our pictures. We stand here, one in the east, one in the south, one in the west and one in the north; but when you draw the picture you must place us all in the east." The third picture in the series (Plate xxxiii) is supposed to be made in accordance with these instructions. To indicate their great height the figures are twice the length of any in the other pictures, except the rainbow figures, and each is clothed in four garments, one above another; for no one garment, they say, can be made long enough to cover such giant forms. The form im- mediately north of the center is done first, in white, and repre- sents the east; that next to it, on the south, comes second in order, is painted in blue and represents the south. The form next below the latter is in yellow and depicts the goddess who stood in the west of the house of dew-drops. The figure in the extreme north is drawn last of all, in black, and belongs to the north. As before stated, these bodies are first made naked and afterwards clothed. The exposed chests, arms and thighs display the colors of which the entire bodies were originally composed. Some small animal called the gloi is sacred to these goddesses. Two of</page><page sequence="10">938 Mythic Dry-Paintings of the Navajos. [October, these creatures are shown in the east, guarding the entrance to the lodge. The appendages at the sides of the heads of the god- desses represent the glbi-bichad, or head-dresses of glow skins of different colors, which these mythic personages are said to wear. Each one bears, attached to the right hand, a rattle, a charm and a branch of choke-cherry in blossom (highly conventionalized). Some other adjuncts of the picture-the red robes embroidered with sunbeams, the forearms and legs clothed with clouds and lightning, the pendants from wrists and elbows, the blue and red armlets, bracelets and garters-are properties of nearly all the anthropomorphic gods shown in these pictures. The rainbow which encloses the group on three sides is not the anthropomor- phic rainbow, it has no head, neck, arms or lower extremities. Five white eagle-plumes adorn its south-eastern end; five tail- plumes of some blue bird decorate the bend in the south-west; the tail of the red-shafted flicker is near the bend in the north- west, and the tail of the magpie terminates the north-eastern extremity. Throughout the myth not only is the house of dew spoken of as adorned with hangings and festoons of rainbows, but nearly all the holy dwellings are thus embellished. The fourth picture represents the Kaltso-yisthan, or great plumed arrows. These arrows are the especial great mystery, the potent healing charm of the dance. On the last night, many public aul/is (shows, dances) may be given-shows of all sorts of socie- ties and bands, shows adopted from. alien tribes. From dark to dawn these continue around the great central fire and within the dark fence of evergreen branches. All of these may be changed, omitted, or have others substituted for them, except the dance of the great plumed arrow, this cannot be left out. The three paintings remaining to be described are those of the kledji-hiathal (chant of the night), or dance of the Yeibichai (grand-uncle of the gods). They represent some of the visions of another Navajo prophet named Sho. The myth recounting his adventures is interesting, but too long to be related here. In childhood and youth he showed signs of unusual wisdom. He often told his immediate relations that he held converse with the gods; but they doubted him until, as he grew older, he exhibited such unquestionable evidence of second-sight that the most skep- tical were convinced. On one of his rambles he saw what he supposed to be a small herd of big-horn or Rocky-mountain</page><page sequence="11">I 88g.] Mythic Dry-Paindtngs of the Navajos. 939 sheep, and went in pursuit. Four times he waylaid them and tried to shoot them, but each time when he drew his arrow to the head it would not leave the string. Then he knew the sheep to be divinities in disguise. He approached them; they threw off their sheep-skin coverings and revealed themselves as the ga'askidz or gods of plenty. They bore Sho to their home, admitted him to their sacred rites, taught him all their mysteries, and sent him back to his people that he might teach the mysteries to man. All his adventures and visions are embodied in the months and rites of the kledji-hatlzal. When his mission was done he was taken back by the gods to dwell among them forever. The form of the gaaskidi appears several times in the pictures. It' is represented as having sheep's horns on the head, wearing a crown of black clouds garnished with lightning and fringed with sunbeams, bearing on the back a great sack made of the black thunder-cloud (said to be filled with all sorts of edible seeds and fruits), and leaning on a staff to indicate that the sack of plenty is a heavy burthen. Various other important characters of the Navajo mythology appear in these pictures. One of the Yeibiclzai paintings delineates a very singular vision or revelation of the prophet Siho. It is called the tsiznaOle, or whirling sticks. On one occasion Sho was led by the gods to the shores of a dark lake, on the borders of which grew four stalks of sacred corn, each of a different color. In the center of the lake lay two logs, crossing one another at right angles; near the two extremities of each sat a pair of Yeis, male and female, making eight in all. On the shore of the lake stood four more Yeis, three of whom had staves, by means of which they kept the logs whirling around with a constant motion, while the Yeis sitting on the logs sang songs which are still preserved in the multitudinous chants of this rite under the name of tsiznao'le-bigin, or songs of the whirling sticks. All the circumstances of this strange scene are duly symbolized in the painting. The two other pictures represent scenes in the dance of the Yeibichai, as Sho witnessed it among the gods, and with some modifications they would make fair representations of the dance as it is enacted by the Navajos to-day. The pictures are beauti- ful, and appear of high interest when their symbolism is explained; but I have not space to describe them, and, as before stated, they are too intricate to be suitably illustrated here.</page></plain_text>
