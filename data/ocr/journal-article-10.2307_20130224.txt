The scope, com plexity, and ongoing development of his extensive body of philosophical work call for the location of central themes and arguments. This collec tion of essays, originaUy pubUshed or written between 1966 and 1995, sets forth those themes that dominate Potter's thought. In his excellent Foreword, Vincent M. Colapietro points out that Pot ter was a "critical traditionalist" who places Peirce's thought within an "ongoing critical dialogue with ancestors as well as contemporaries" (p. x). Potter placed himself within this continuum by engaging in "think ing through some set of issues ... to which the text being interpreted was devoted" (pp. x-xi). After an initial "Overview" chapter on Peirce's work, and a historical chapter on "Peirce's British Connection," the dis cussion of issues begins in earnest. The next three chapters show how Peirce's theory of inquiry mediates between "the error of making action the be-all and end-all of thought" (p. 38) and the opposite error of making inquiry so theoretical and ab stract it does not engage our interests. Paraphrased, Peirce is saying: "Seek first the truth, all these [practical] things w?l be added to you" (p. 69). "Peirce and Normative Science" gives an ingenious explication of Peirce's view that ethics and, ultimately, aesthetics, are the supreme normative sciences that govern the end of inquiry. Aesthetics is not be yond our control (p. 57), "so the business of esthetics is to seek out through reflective analysis ... what end is ultimate (can be consistently pursued in any and aU circumstances) and to use this as a normal in adopting any particular esthetic quality as an ideal" (p. 59). Chapters 4-6 deal directly with Peirce's effort to distinguish between theory and practice without confusing the two and making theory sub ordinate to practice. For Peirce, scientific inquiry presupposes realism, and the real is coextensive with the knowable (p. 75). Peirce's 1878 es says seemed to identify meaning with "action-reaction" (p. 79), the end of thought as a belief, and eventually habit as specific rule of action. Later, Peirce clarified this view, by saying that "the meaning of a con ception can be found, not in the action, but in "the end for which the ac tion is done" (p. 82). Meaning is a step in the direction of the ultimate end of thought as the discovery of real things. The goal of a particular inquiry is not action as singular, but belief and eventually habit as a gen</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 437 eral category or "third" (p. 83). Chapter 6 sets forth Peirce's view that "dispositional properties" or "sensible effects" of an object refer to real things, to "all those [effects] conceivable, not merely those actually real ized" (p. 97). Chapter 7 gives Peirce's view on "substance" and "foundations." It is largely based upon a fine discussion of his difficult 1868 articles. Truth, as a foundation of inquiry, is not agreement, but it is that which brings about agreement. Over the long run, the opinion of the community of in vestigators converges, because it is about reality (p. 109). Chapter 8 is a history of the development of Peirce's theory of continuity, and chapter 9 is a comparison of the thought of Peirce and Bernard Lonergan. The remaining three chapters are devoted to Peirce on religious expe rience and God. Chapter 10 on religious experience begins with an ac count of Peirce's account of experience in contrast with that of tradi tional empiricism. This leads him to an experimentalism instead of the traditional epistemological goal of certifying apparent knowledge as true. Experimentalism avoids the difficulties of an "adjectival model" of religious experience as "a name we give to a certain kind of human ex perience" (p. 150) which then must be certified as true. Peirce's "adver bial model" of religious experience is "an ellipsis for experiencing the world religiously" (p. 150). Peirce held that our notion of God must be both anthropomorphic and vague. His Humble Argument for the reality of God leads to a more complete scientific investigation starting with a free meditation or agreeable activity of mind he called "musement" (p. 178). In this in quiry, "the hypothesis of God is to be explored for its implications con cerning human conduct" (p. 189). Does the hypothesis "render practical and operative what those [three normative sciences of logic, ethics, and aesthetics] only generally and formally characterize" (p. 190)? No brief account can do justice to the depth of Potter's work and the subtlety of his interpretation. The scope, complexity, and precision of the scientific enterprise challenge any ordinary inquirer who takes seri ously the task of locating his or place in relation to the universe. Peirce was not an ordinary inquirer. Potter is his coworker and helper, as he goes about the task of clarifying and synthesizing Peirce's account of in quiry, reality, and God. He does this very well.?Donald F. Koch, Michi gan State University.</page></plain_text>
