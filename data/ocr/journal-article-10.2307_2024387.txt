<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUBSTANCE AND TIME G USTAV BERGMANN has an argument which purports to establish that a substance ontology is untenable. In this paper, I will show that his argument does not succeed. Bergmann's argument* claims that anyone holding a substance ontology must also accept temporal individuals (moments, for example) which have roughly the same ontological status as sub- stances. Without temporal individuals, a substance ontology is con- tradictory. Since most philosophers who defend a substance ontology do not accept temporal individuals, this argument would lead us to reject their views as inconsistent. Bergmann has other arguments against substances that I will not consider. He claims, for example, that A substance is a simple individual, is a continuant, and has a nature. Or, rather, this is the "idea" of substance. Its several parts are irreconcilable with each other.' Or we are told that Aristotle's individuals are substances; his characters, attributes. The former "create" or "produce" the latter, the latter "inhere" in the 20 For a construction of the spatial metric tensor, see Trautman, op. cit. * This argument can be found in "Individuals," "Russell's Examination of Leibniz Examined," and "Some Reflections on Time," all of which are reprinted in Meaning and Existence (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1960).

In the quoted passage, it may be that the 'irreconcilable' refers to the contradiction which results from refusing to admit temporal indi- viduals. If so, the quoted passage does not present a different reason for rejecting a substance ontology.</page><page sequence="2">278 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY former . . . . "Inherence" or, conversely, "creation" is a sort of tie. The trouble is that closer analysis reveals it to be irremediably anthropomorphic. This is the fatal flaw not just of Aristotelianism but of all substantialist ontologies.2 And acceptance of a (the?) Principle of Acquaintance leads one to reject substances; for if we are acquainted (in the relevant sense) with any things, they are surely not substances. One reason for not dealing with Bergmann's other arguments is that I am not concerned with a full-fledged, or classical, substance ontology. Such an ontology, according to Bergmann, makes four distinguishable claims: S1. Substances are individuals. S2. Substances are continuants. S3. Substances are capable of existing independently. S4. Substances have natures (160). The ontology I shall present involves the more modest claims that there are enduring individuals (continuants) which have properties and which are related to one another. That the properties and rela- tions of a single individual can be different at different times. And that there are no temporal individuals. So far as I can tell, someone holding such an ontology is not committed to further views concern- ing the simplicity, independence, or natures of the enduring individuals. My not considering all of Bergmann's discussions of substance is also due to the limited aim of this paper. I am not trying to give a complete ontological account, or even to give conclusive reasons for accepting a substance ontology. To give a complete account I would have to explore the relation, or tie, or connection, if any, between an individual and its properties and relations. But I shall say that an individual has properties and relations, and let it go at that. If I were to present a conclusive defense, I would need to discuss the Principle of Acquaintance, and provide reasons for rejecting it; but I shall not do this. I am concerned only with showing that Berg- mann's argument is not successful. If I am successful in this paper, I will have shown that some form of substance ontology is con- ceivable, and that it does not lead to immediate or obvious contradiction. Bergmann makes use of an ideal language in arguing against a substance ontology. Such a language is one whose grammatical structure represents (or reflects) perspicuously certain ontological 2 "Ontological Alternatives," Logic and Reality, p. 150.</page><page sequence="3">SUBSTANCE AND TIME 279 features (its logical form coincides with its grammatical form). For Bergmann, an ideal language is not one that is used for the purpose of communicating. Instead, the language is described schematically, and the philosopher presents and defends his view by commenting, in ordinary language, upon the ideal-language schemata. For the purposes of this paper, we can identify Bergmann's ideal language with the familiar apparatus of the predicate calculus. Bergmann has found it necessary to extend the symbolism of predicate calculus in order to deal with intentionality, but this extension is not relevant to the present discussion (see "Intentionality"). For Bergmann, both singular terms (constants belonging to the same grammatical category as individual variables) and predicates are names. Singular terms name momentary individuals sometimes called bare particulars. Predicates name universals. The application of a predicate to a singular term (or of an n-place predicate to n singular terms) represents the fact that the named individual exem- plifies the named universal. In arguing against a substance ontology, Bergmann uses the schematism of the predicate calculus; he claims that singular terms cannot be the names of continuants. Cannot, that is, unless one is willing to admit temporal individuals. Bergmann states his argument very simply: Let 'a' and fi' name an individual (SI) which is a continuant (S2) and a character, respectively. Continuants (substances) do at times exemplify characters which they don't exemplify at others. Assume fl to be such a character of a. Then 'sfi (a)' and 'fl (a)' are both true. This is logical catastrophe; so the system breaks down (183). However, If one writes 'fi(a, ti)' instead of 'fi(a)' the predicament dis- appears... [This way out] makes time absolute by making the 'ti' names of individuals (SI) (183/4). Strictly speaking, it is not necessary that "times" be in the same category as ordinary individuals. For Bergmann writes, I assume thus that the 't%' in 'fi(a, ti)' is of type zero. Formally one could assign it to type one. However, the victory would be hollow, not necessarily because 'fl' would then be of the rather com- plex type (0, 1) but, rather, because it would still be true that the 'ti' occur always as subjects and never as predicates (fn 51, p. 184). To avoid contradiction, the substance ontologist must admit abso- lute times which are either of the same (ontological) category as ordinary individuals or of some different category. It does not matter</page><page sequence="4">280 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to which category they are assigned, for in either case they are the subjects of relations, and no individuals are exemplified by them. And in either case, what we ordinarily regard as n-place predicates turn out to be (n + 1)-place predicates; so that "no ordinary indi- vidual exemplifies a non-relational character" (230). Surely the sub- stance ontologist who is forced to swallow this much is in trouble, and he ought seriously to consider adopting an alternative ontology. II There are two ways in which one might oppose Bergmann's argu- ment. The first way is to reject the ideal-language approach to philosophy altogether. Or one could admit the value or validity of the ideal-language approach, but reject the ideal language chosen by Bergmann. I will not reject the ideal-language approach. But my way of re- garding an ideal language is somewhat different from Bergmann's, and I find it more comfortable to speak of reformed languages rather than ideal ones. I think that the ordinary use of ordinary language in- volves ontological commitments and that our ordinary conceptual framework is the source of the substance ontology I shall present. For it is my view that there is a sense of 'fundamental' in which it is correct to say that the most fundamental ontological commitment of ordinary language is the commitment to enduring individuals which have properties and which are related to one another. (Al- though I think this sense of 'fundamental' can be satisfactorily ex- plained, I shall not try to do so here.) And I would argue that the fundamental character of this ontological commitment is a sufficient reason for accepting this commitment until it is shown to be untenable. Ordinary language involves other commitments which are not fundamental and which may not be mutually consistent. And ordi- nary language is not perspicuous with respect to ontological con- siderations. These shortcomings of ordinary language make a re- formed language a very useful vehicle for presenting, discussing, and defending a philosophical view. For the reformed language provides a convenient way to distinguish those ordinary-language commit- ments one accepts from those one does not. And the conceptual apparatus of a reformed language is perspicuous; its ontological commitments are explicit. So now I must criticize Bergmann's ideal language and present an alternative in its place. The first of these tasks is relatively easy. It is rather clear that a language based on the predicate calculus is not the best sort of language to use in talking about time. The predicate</page><page sequence="5">SUBSTANCE AND TIME 28I calculus was designed for studying mathematics and mathematical reasoning. It is characteristic of mathematical talk, even in ordinary (nonformalized) language, that it is independent of temporal con- siderations. Of course, in ordinary language, mathematical state- ments are made in what is grammatically the present tense; but, as understood, these statements involve no reference to a temporal "location." It is because mathematical claims are timeless that it is odd to say such things as "Two and two was four" or "Two and two will be four." Since the symbolism of the predicate calculus was de- signed for making statements that have no temporal content, it is not surprising if this symbolism fails to represent changeable indi- viduals in a perspicuous manner.' Nor does this failure, by itself, constitute any argument against a substance ontology. In the following sections I shall develop some reformed languages that represent, or reflect, a substance ontology. The construction of such a language is no proof that its commitments are correct. But this construction will be sufficient to refute Bergmann's claim that a substance ontology without temporal individuals must be contra- dictory. And refuting Bergmann's claim is my goal in this paper. III In developing reformed languages for making statements about con- tinuants, I will proceed informally. The grammatical structures of these languages will be explained, as will the significance of certain constants. But I will not supply axioms for these languages, nor will I present a formal semantics. This means that I cannot establish the consistency of these languages in a rigorous fashion. However, the possibility that these languages are inconsistent seems remote. And it is clear that the contradiction brandished by Bergmann does not arise. When he discusses his ideal language and the difficulty of talking about continuants with this language, Bergmann fastens too rigidly on the grammatical categories of customary systems of predicate calculus. There is a way to modify the predicate calculus so that it is better suited to reflect a substance ontology. This can be done by introducing multi-link functors, of the sort used by Lesniewski. A multi-link, or many-link functor is complex; it contains a functor- forming functor and its arguments. To rewrite (in a reformed lan- guage) a tensed sentence about an individual, we can use a sentence whose predicate is a multi-link functor with two parts. The basic 3 I owe this argument against Bergmann's use of the symbolism of predicate calculus to Wilfrid Sellars, who presented it in a lecture, "Metaphysics and the Concept of a Person," delivered at the State University of New York at Buffalo in the summer of 1968.</page><page sequence="6">282 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sentence-form for sentences about enduring individuals might be fAt) (x) This can be read, "x is f at t," where the 'is' must be understood in a timeless sense. In this scheme, the predicate is not 'f' but 'f(t)'. We can speak of the 'f' and the 't' as the qualitative and the temporal components of the predicate, respectively.4 The introduction of multi-link functors leads to changes in the syntax of the predicate calculus (and to corresponding changes in the syntax of languages based on the predicate calculus). The definition of a well-formed formula becomes more complicated, and so do the rules of inference. But the basic apparatus of the predicate calculus is retained. The well-formed formulas of ordinary predicate calculus remain well-formed; and these formulas have the same signifiance as before.' In a reformed language based on the modified predicate calculus, temporal expressions are not singular terms, and they do not fill the argument places of predicates. So we can talk about con- tinuants without turning n-place predicates into (n + 1)-place predicates. To attribute a nonrelational property to a continuant, we can use a sentence having the form: f(t) (x). In Lesniewski's terminology, the three expressions 'f,' 't,' 'x' belong to different semantical categories. Each of these categories appears to be primitive-none of them can be introduced by definition in terms of more fundamental cate- gories.6 And none of these categories consists of composite expres- sions, in the sense that the predicates used to characterize con- tinuants are composite. The need for a fundamental category of temporal expressions raises certain problems for the substance ontology I am presenting. If this reformed language is to make ontological commitments explicit, then some of its grammatical dis- 4 In this case, the 'f' is a predicate-forming functor for one temporal component as argument. The predicate it forms is singulary. I will use the expression 'quali- tative component' so that it also applies to predicate-forming functors that form n-adic predicates. 6 I must make some qualification when I speak of the "customary" significance of the formulas of the predicate calculus. For I do not have in mind a set-theoreti- cal interpretation of these formulas, which assigns indiviuals to singular terms and classes to predicates. I am developing a reformed language in order to present an ontology. This language has no category of terms that designate classes; so classes cannot be used to provide an interpretation. A formula like 'f(x)' is sig- nificant as presenting the form of a sentence in which a predicate is applied to a singular term. 6 But there are more than three fundamental categories. For each positive integer n, there is a category of qualitative expressions forming n-adic predicates for a single temporal argument. For each n, the category of n-adic predicates is also fundamental; and the category of propositions (sentences) is fundamental.</page><page sequence="7">SUBSTANCE AND TIME 283 tinctions must correspond to ontological distinctions. But it is reasonable to claim that the fundamental, noncomposite categories of expressions needed for talking about continuants correspond to different sorts of entity. This claim makes the temporal components of predicates look suspiciously like the names of temporal indi- viduals. In the following sections, I will demonstrate that the tem- poral components of predicates need not be regarded as fundamental and irreducible. IV The reformed language to be sketched in this section is one in which the temporal components of predicates belong to a primitive seman- tical category. But this language prepares the way for the language in the following section; and that language abolishes the category of temporal components as a primitive noncomposite category. The language being developed now is tensed; its basic temporal expressions are used to indicate past, present, and future. These temporal expressions will normally be written as superscripts, rather than in the manner of the preceding section (but the super- script notation can be viewed as abbreviating the canonical notation of the preceding section). The presence of tensed sentences enables us to construct a sentence that is true at one time and false at an- other. This feature might be undesirable in a language designed for scientific purposes, but it is not a shortcoming of the present lan- guage, which is intended to serve philosophic ends. A tensed state- ment will be made with a sentence fi(x) where Lfi' is the predicate, 'f' the qualitative component, and 'i' the temporal component (but all the expressions in this example are variables). Sentences in the past, present, and future tenses, re- spectively, will be written f-(x) fW(x) f+(x) (i.e., x was f, x is f, x will be f). A sentence 'f (x)' means that x was f at some time in the past; it is compatible with x's not being f at some other time in the past. (It is also compatible with 'a f?(x)' and 'a f+(x)'.) In addition to the temporal expressions for tenses, I will introduce a temporal expression '*', which is characterized by (1) f*(x) 9 f-(x) V f0(x) V f+(x) A sentence 'f* (x)' is used to say that x was, is, or will be f. The tensed language requires two negations. One is the customary sentential negation, for which '"' is used. The other is a qualitative</page><page sequence="8">284 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY negation, which I will indicate by placing a line over the qualitative component of the predicate.' A sentence 'f-(x)' means that x was non-f at some time in the past.8 Note that f-(x) and f-(x) are compatible, as are the corresponding pair of sentences in the future tense. Our tensed language as so far constituted lacks the resources for indicating temporal order. The tenses make it possible to distinguish past from present from future, but they do not enable us to say that one event in the past occurred before another. This difficulty will be remedied by introducing new expressions for indicating temporal relations between events (between the having of properties by indi- viduals). These expressions are a kind of sentential connectives; let us call them temporal connectives. One of these is 'Before'. A sentence .ft-(x) Before g-(y) means that there was a time when x was f which preceded a time when y was g. We can have both .f-(x) Before g-(y) and g-(y) Before f--(x) since x could have been f at many distinguishable times in the past, and so could y have been g. We can also have t--(x) Before f--(x) (In fact, if x was f, then f-(x) Before f-(x) unless f is an instan- taneous property that x had only once.) The connective 'Before' is not transitive, for if both f-(x) Before g-(y) and g-(y) Before h-(z) it may still be that f-(x) Before h-(z) is false, because y might have been g at different times. 7 There is an added complication which I am ignoring. For each qualitative com- ponent, there is a positive integer n such that the qualitative component forms an n-adic predicate for a temporal component argument. Since for each n there is a distinct category of qualitative components, there must also be a different quali- tative negation for each n. But no harm will be done if I use the same symbol for all these different negations; in each case, its semantical category will depend on the semantical category of the qualitative component that is its argument. 8 In this paper I will simply duck questions concerning the ontological status of qualitative negation (i.e., whether the symbols for qualitative negation designate anything) and of the complements of properties and relations. Even though the purpose of a (fundamental) grammatical distinction in a reformed language is to signal an ontological distinction, it is often convenient to introduce terms in a fundamental category which do not designate any single entity. For example, if red and round are two distinct properties, we may have reason to introduce a single term to characterize those individuals which are both red and round.</page><page sequence="9">SUBSTANCE AND TIME 285 The addition of temporal connectives brings additional compli- cations to the reformed language. In the first place, these connectives make sense only when they are used to join atomic sentences whose predicates have temporal components. For if we have three sen- tences 'f (x)', 'g0(y)', 'h+(z)' the following makes no sense: [fE(X) : g0(y)] Before h+(z) And if numerical expressions are included among the singular terms of the language, a sentence [Even (2)] Before f0(x) also makes no sense. The formation rules of the language must permit the temporal connectives to join only atomic sentences whose predicates have temporal components. To present the reformed language by means of a formal system, we can employ two sorts of propositional variable. One of these consists of ordinary proposi- tional variables (p, q, r, s, etc.) for which substitution is legitimate. The other sort (I will use: P, Q, R, S, etc.) can be replaced only by atomic formulas whose predicates have temporal components. These variables are useful for presenting characteristics of temporal con- nectives, as (2) P Before Q n P &amp; Q Another complication due to the temporal connectives is more troublesome. These connectives deprive the reformed language of its extensional character, for they are clearly not truth-functional. Two other temporal connectives are required; these are 'When' and 'Between'. A sentence 'f-(x) When g(y)' means that x was f at a time when y was g. Some characteristics of 'When' are given below: (3) P z P When P (4) P When Q z P (5) P When Q :) QWhenP A sentence 'ft(x) Between [g-(y), h-(z)]' means that there was a (single) time when x was f that came after a time when y was g and before a time when z was h. One characteristic of 'Between' is given by (6) P Between [Q, R] 3 Q Before P &amp; P Before R &amp; Q Before R The temporal connectives make it possible to order events in a fairly rough way, but they do not by themselves provide a means for</page><page sequence="10">286 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY measuring time. This is because a sentence 'f(x)' [or 'f+(x)'] is, in a sense, general. For x might have been f at many times in the past, and the sentence does not specify any particular time. To measure time, we must be able to date events. We can do this if we use certain sorts of properties. At least two sorts of property will do; I will call them continuous properties and instantaneous properties.9 Continuous properties are explained by (7) C {If, X} =def f*(x) &amp; - [f*(x) Between [f*(x), f*(x)]] A property f is continuous on an individual x if x has f at some time, and x's having f does not occur both before and after a time when x is not f. Instantaneous properties are probably more useful for dating purposes. Such properties are explained by (8) I{ f, X } = def f* (X) &amp; [Ef* (X) Before f* (x) ] If a property f is instantaneous on x, then x has f just once, and the duration of this having cannot be subdivided. (If a property is in- stantaneous on an individual, then it is also continuous on that individual.) With a continuous or instantaneous property f, the generality of sentences 'f-(x)' and 'f+(x)' can be reduced or removed. Either sort of property can be used to introduce nontensed talk about con- tinuants. If we use 'ri', 'T2' as temporal-component-forming functors for one qualitative argument and one singular term argument, we can define these functors with (9) f'r(g, y)(x) =def Cag, y} &amp; f*(x) When g*(y) (10) fr2(g, y)(X) =def I{g, y} &amp; f*(x) When g*(y) This shows that talk about particular times need not be taken as primitive in a tensed language. V The reformed language of the preceding section shows that the names of temporal individuals are not necessary for talking about con- tinuants. But that language contains four kinds of fundamental semantical categories which seem to require corresponding entities. These are the categories of singular terms, qualitative components of predicates, temporal components of predicates, and temporal connectives (these belong to the various categories of sentential connectives, but constitute distinctive subcategories). From the standpoint of the substance ontology I am presenting, the temporal 9 In speaking of such properties, I am not committing myself to their existence as simple qualities (or relations). It may be that no ontologically simple quality is either continuous or instantaneous. But conjunctions of simple qualities can be designated by a single predicate, and it is sufficient for dating purposes that these conjunctions be continuous or instantaneous.</page><page sequence="11">SUBSTANCE AND TIME 287 components of predicates are objectionable expressions. The need for such expressions is ontologically committing even if we can get along without names for individual times. But there is nothing ob- jectionable about temporal connectives. I am trying to show that we can accept a substance ontology without accepting temporal indi- viduals. It is no part of my goal to elaborate a substance ontology that does not make provision for time. In developing the reformed language of this section, I will employ many of the principles that govern a Lesniewski-type system of pred- icate calculus. But this language contains no predicates. The primi- tive semantical categories include categories of singular terms, of qualitative expressions (there is a different category of qualitative expressions for each different number of arguments), and of temporal connectives. But the qualitative expressions are not predicate- forming functors, and the temporal connectives are not sentential connectives. This reformed language has a new primitive semantical category, that of qualified-individual expressions (I will abbreviate 'qualified-individual expression' as 'qie'). A qualified-individual ex- pression is formed from an n-adic qualitative component and n singular terms. Qies are written fi[x]i f Ix,y]A etc. I will use P, Q, R, S, etc. as variables in the category of qies. A qie is not a sentence. These expressions are the arguments of temporal connectives, which are sentence-forming functors for qie arguments. The same temporal connectives are used in this language as in the language of the preceding section. A sentence fffx] When gfyA means that x was, is, or will be f at a time when y was, is, or will be g. Some characteristics of 'When' are given by (11) PWhen Q D QWhenP (12) PWhen Q : PWhenP The fundamental way of saying that x was, is, or will be f is (13) f[xX When fj{x] This will be abbreviated as 'f*ix]', but this abbreviation must not be regarded as a sentence formed from the application of a predicate to a singular term. The reformed language has no predicates. The temporal connectives 'Before' and 'Between' are also needed, and have the characteristics that one might expect. Continuous and instantaneous properties can be given definitions analogous to those of the preceding section, and can again be used for purposes of dating. In the reformed language, there are three important nega-</page><page sequence="12">288 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tions. The first is sentential negation: A. The second negation is the negation of a qie: fIJx]. This overbar is a qie-forming functor for one qie argument. A sentence (14) fjfx] When gDy] means that x is f at some time when it is not the case that y is g; this is to be contrasted with (15) [fifx] When gjf]y which can be true even if x is never f and y is never g. The third negation must be introduced separately for each category of quali- tative expression; this negation forms the complement: f. A sentence (16) ffx] When gady means that x is f when y is non-g. This is false if y does not exist when x is f, but (14) will be true in such a case. The foregoing explanation of the reformed language of this section is sufficient for understanding the basic structure of the language and the significance of certain expressions. I think it is clear that this reformed language perspicuously reflects a substance ontology that does not recognize temporal individuals. The language captures the fundamental ontological commitments of our ordinary conceptual framework. It is of some interest to consider how we can revise the language of this section so that it incorporates predicates. Such a revision would justify the substance ontologist in using the apparatus of the predicate calculus without accepting either unwelcome ontological commitments or inevitable contradiction. To accomplish this re- vision, we can introduce a functor that converts qualitative compo- nents into predicate-forming functors. I will use a subscript 'c' for this purpose; so that fM(P) (x) is equivalent to fifx] When P Here 'f0(P)' is a predicate, and 'f0,' is a predicate-forming functor for one qie argument.'0 The basic sentence-form for predicative 10 Since the qualitative components belong to different categories, we could introduce a different 'c' for each category. But the character of 'c' is primarily combinatorial (in the sense of combinatory logic). And a consistent system of combinatory logic can be constructed in which certain combinators belong to more than one category [cf. L. E. Sanchis, "Types in Combinatory Logic," Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic v, 3 (July 1964): 161-180]. So we might get by with a single multi-category 'c'.</page><page sequence="13">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 289 sentences about continuants is now 'So(t) (x)'. This is the form intro- duced in section III. But the expression in '( )' need not be inter- preted as the name of a temporal individual; it is a qie. The reformed language of this section, even after its revision, is extensional. For temporal connectives are not sentential connectives; all sentential connectives are truth-functional. VI In the preceding section I made good my claim that a language can be formulated to reflect a substance ontology without terms for temporal individuals. This is sufficient to show that Bergmann is wrong when he insists that a substance ontology that does not admit temporal individuals will end in contradiction. I have also indicated how my reformed language can incorporate sentences from a predi- cate-calculus language, although it is a predicate-calculus language with multi-link functors. The reformed language contains an irreducible category of tem- poral connectives. On my way of understanding the reformed lan- guage, this irreducible category indicates an inescapable ontological commitment of the substance ontologist. Anyone who holds that there are continuants having different properties and relations at different times must accept temporal relations. And these temporal relations are not "ordinary" relations: they do not connect indi- viduals. Instead, temporal relations hold between individuals- having-properties. (And I would claim that an event is just an indi- vidual having a property or several individuals being related.) This shows how different, for a substance ontology, are time and space. Spatial relations are ordinary relations, relating continuants. Tem- poral relations relate individuals-having-ordinary-properties-and- relations. Individuals-having-spatial-relations occur in the temporal sequence. JOHN T. KEARNS State University of New York at Buffalo</page></plain_text>
