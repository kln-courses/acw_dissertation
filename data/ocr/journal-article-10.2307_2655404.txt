It is a poststructural step beyond post- modernism and a leap beyond the Cartesian dualisms that were once a radical call to rea- son. Interpreting Visual Cultu^e is most suc- cessful when it presents a bridge between American and British social theory and an elaboration of themes in visual sociology that our British colleagues bring to the Interna- tional Visual Sociology Association. Several of the essays, notably by Chris Jenks on Durkheim, and Diane Hill on feminist art crit- icism, demonstrate that one can write on these topics with grace and coherence. Other essays are at times hard to trace to the spe- cific topic of visual culture. The overarching framework of this volume, expressed very simply, is a three-part evolu- tion of social thought. The first stage in this evolution is the epistemology described by Rene Descartes in the seventeenth century, especially in his classic MeditcBtlosls osl F?rst C0l 1 tel zltbos cz 1*v Soc iolc)g p} .30, 2 Skillington) and debates over genetically altered plants in Germany (Bora), but the lack of comparisons across national borders, in a volume devoted to happenings in Europe, makes the volume somewhat disjointed. One cannot help but wonder if the German press treats biotechnology differently than the British press does, or if the debate over genet- ically altered plants might have a different twist in France or the Netherlands. In addition, several of the authors stray from the theme. The chapter by Byk on law only mentions risk issues in passing. Instead, we learn that law is conservative while biotechnology is innovative- hardly an orig- inal insight. On the other hand, Byk rightly notes that the law is ill-equipped to deal with the enormous diversity of interests linked to biotechnology- consumers, entrepreneurs, scientists, large corporations, environmental- ists, and so on. Nevertheless, given the diver- sity of legal systems in Europe, one wishes that Byk had compared continental law based on Napoleonic Code with British com- mon law. Might it be the case that some legal systems are more effective in dealing with diverse interests than are others? I found myself frustrated by the fact that the term risk is used differently by each con- tributor: for some, it refers to health and safe- ty risks to humans; to others it refers to environmental risks (although Bora distin- guishes unconvincingly between hazards of natural disasters and risks that are self-creat- ed); to still others it relates to economic risks taken by entrepreneurs. When paired with the term responsibility, these different uses of the term risk create confusion. One can argue that we have a collective responsibility to see to it that health and safety risks are minimized, and a similar argument might be made for the environment as a whole. But I cannot see how we have any collective responsibility for the economic risks that entrepreneurs incur by investing in biotechnology. Perhaps this is because we are not talking about the same phenomenon. Finally, the volume suffers from occasion- ally obfuscatory language. To wit: "The man- ner in which this general problem addressed by the discourse of modernity has become collectively defined as an in principle resolv- able one can be gathered from the cognitive structures or, rather, the cognitive order, that underpin the modern perception and experi- ence of the social and natural world and direct and guide action, and thus in turn again lend structure to the discourse of modernity itselft' (p. 29). All too often we learn that science did something, or that people can only commu- nicate within certain discourse frames. Arguably, this kind of language reifies the issues at hand. Yet, if one wants to build an ethic of responsibility, then one must neces- sarily dereify these forces to which we find ourselves subjected. One can hardly be responsible if one is compelled to do things and to think in certain ways by mystified pow- ers. In sum, this volume attempts to address a topic of considerable importance to our con- temporary world. It raises issues about which sociologists should be informed. But those who wish to have these issues clarified will have to await another volume.</page><page sequence="2">164 Ideology and Cultural Production Philosophy. According to the editors, Descartes' reformulation of classic philosophy to a commitment to reason is based on an "ocularcentric turn to the knowing subject" (p. 239). This is represented in the familiar Carte- sian dualisms (matter/spirit; body/mind; mate- rialism/idealism) that call upon a subject whose consciousness is based on (visual) per- ception. The second stage in this three-part evolu- tion is found in the phenomenology of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty but also in the descriptive analysis of modern experience found in the works of sociologists and theorists such as Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, and Marx, Weber, and Durkheim. The phenomenological turn replaces Carte- sian dualism with pure consciousness, tran- scending empiricism and rationalism. The editors embrace a third stage, extend- ing the visual ontology of classical phenom- enology, to existentialism and a phenomenology more oriented toward visual perception gathered under the umbrella of hermeneutics. Concern for the voice of the other is the critical dimension of this poststructural hermeneutics. It is the role of vision, visuality, the gaze, the vision of the other, the critical history of art, the nature of aesthetic perception, and the ethics of seeing that concern the essays in this volume. The essays are presented in three sections. An opening section on theory (though, of course, all the essays are theoretical) includes Nicholas Davey's essay on Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger's hermeneu- tics of seeing, and Ian Sandywell's critique of Descartes based on Bakhtin's dialogical con- ception, Sartre's existentialism, and several poststructural thinkers. Michael Gardiner's essay develops these themes within Mikhail Bakhtin's postocularcentric approach. Chris Jenks, one of the few sociologists in the vol- ume, offers a tightly argued treatise on the double vision behind Durkheim's models of mechanical and organic social solidarity. Perhaps the clearest expositions of the vol- ume's central thesis are four essays on art: Nigel Whiteley on the experience of art, a meditation on sketches by Pierre Bonnard written by Michael Phillipson and Chris Fish- er, and essays on feminist art criticism by Diane Hill and John A. Smith. Diane Hill, for example, questions the feminist art critic Griselda Pollocks reductiorl of visual alt to graphics but writes, "What is clearly happen- ing now is that a new development is taking place amongst some feminist artists who are wanting to continue to hold dear broad, new art history values and commitments to femi- nist values, but who perhaps believe there was a baby along with the scum-ridden and fiothy bath water that seemed to drown wom- en's creativity. Neither is the baby unrecon- structively male and intrinsically patriarchal; nor is it incorrigibly reactionary or nostalgic" (p. 143). Hill's analysis of recent feminist painting that explores the aesthetics of new artwork in the context of feminist conscious- ness is marred by the small black and white reproductions of the paintings under consid- eration. For a book on rethinking visualiza- tion, I would have expected the publisher to offer a higher quality visual experience. The third set of essays, on the ethics of the visual, by David Michael Levin, Ian Heywood, and J.M. Bernstein, questions the philoso- pher's gaze; how art presents ideology as well as image; and the projection of human mean- ing into the nonhuman world, a critical eval- uation of anthropomorphism in modern alt. Most of the authors are British philoso- phers working in departments of fine arts or teaching social theory in related departments; the few sociologists repl^esented in the volume are working in the area of cultural studies. This is not a helpful volume for a reader approaching current debates about Bakhtin, Lacan, Levinas, or other cultural theorists for the first time. It will be a useful text for advanced graduate students and social theo- rists working through poststructural argu- ments on how we visually appropriate and inhabit the world. A surprising shortcoming of the book, particularly given its topic, is its largely male, European and North American authorship. Further, it may not be in the nature of this material to generate clarity of expression, the introductory essay, unfortu- nately, is especially obtuse, so there is the sense that issues are often made more com- plex than they have to be. Having said that, several of the essays, especially those con- cerned with feminist art criticism, may set the terms of the debate for future developments in poststructural cultural theory. Other essays, being anything but solid, will perhaps melt illtO the ai1. Contesezposcl1&gt;y Sociolog, . 3Â°1 2</page></plain_text>
