<plain_text><page sequence="1">POETRY PEACOCK Michael Longley Gorse Fires London: Seeker and Warburg, reprinted 1991. 51pp. 6.00 pb. ISBN 043625 67 4 6 Michael Longley is a poet who is entirely happy to live in his home town of Belfast. The fact that he knows where he belongs in this basic sense has, paradoxically, freed him in his career to dwell in other places imaginatively, allusively and physically. His poetry has always ranged widely in its historical, literary and geographical scope in a way that has given depth, density and universality to his work. He is a 'learned poet\ a doaus poeta in the integrated sense that a classical exemplar of his like Tibullus might appreciate. Quintessential^ a lyric poet (he will declare at readings that his twobasic themesare those of love and death), he has pursued his calling with a single-minded integrity which, over the years, has resulted in the four volumes consolidated in Poems 1963-1983 and, now, Gorse Fires, produced twelve years after his last individual volume. The wait was worth while, and Longley has kept his nerve during that fraught transfer between a conventionally youthful lyric career and the kind of later flowering which may, with luck, occur. In this latter context (the Yeatsian one) he is, of course, still a young poet with an extensive potential career ahead of him. Gorse Fires reflects and builds on such ambiguities. In some ways, it reprises earlier preoccupations. The running allusion to First and Second World War poetry in the earlier volumes is extended here to the Spanish Civil War with an elegy for Charles Donnelly, killed at Jarama aged twenty two, and continued more casually and incidentally in a poem such as 'Stone-in-Oxney': At a table which seems to take root in the lawn We breakfast late to a single propeller's drone. The ghost of a Spitfire over Stone-in-Oxney Or a Stuka, its turning-circle that cloud-gap Or wherever you point to show me a bird... This is a relaxed application of a central run of imagery in Longley. Via the personal link of his father's war service. he has always been able to take his concern over conflict and human suffering beyond a purely Irish frame of reference; and Second World War holocaust-themes surface notably in Gorse Fires, developed with the same eye for the banal, poignant detail as in previous evocations of violent death in Ulster: ...You are packing now for the rest of your life Photographs, medicines, a change of underwear, a book, A candlestick, a loaf, sardines, needle and thread. These are your heirlooms, perishables, worldly goods. What you bring is the same as what you leave behind, Your last belonging is a list of your belongings, ('Ghetto') In its overall focus and atmosphere, of all Longley's previous volumes Gor se Fires perhaps most pervasively recalls the 1976 Man Lying on a Wall with its heavy stress on nature, natural processes and the landscape of the poet's other 'home* in Mayo. Longley is able to take the whole of the island of Ireland unselfconsciously into his purview, and it is in the territory around his focal place of Carrigskeewaun that he finds the inspiration for his naturalist's democratic merging of human concerns with the lives of animals and the deathward drift of all things in nature. 'Between Hovers' is amoving lament for a neighbour, announcing itself with a fine coincidence of rhythmic control and colloquial directness: And not even when we ran over the badger Did he tell me he had cancer, Joe OToole Who was psychic about carburettor and clutch And knew a folk cure for the starter-engine. Backing into the dark we floodlit each hair Like a filament of light our lights had put out... The conflation of human and animal fates here is characteristic; and, later, it is a confrontation with an otter which clinches the poem's haunting sense of the pathos of mortality: ...I watched a dying otter gaze right through me At the islands in Clew Bay, as though it were only Between hovers and not too far from the holt. This kind of effect is the opposite of anthropomorphism: human and animal worlds are mutually illuminating. Fusion, in fact, is the outstanding characteristic of the volume. Earlier themes are given new perspectives. The human and the animal, life and death are seen interchangeably as part of the same natural continuum; and Longley is never more observantly alive than in his own imagined funeral procession. In "Detour': I shall be part of the action when his wife Draining the potatoes into the steamy sink Calls to the butcher to get ready for dinner And the publican descends to change a barrel. The tone is mellow, genial and humorous - the black humour carried off with a nicely judged air of casualness and inconsequence: From behind the one locked door for miles around I shall prolong a detailed conversation With the man in the concrete telephone kiosk About where my funeral might be going next The rich exuberance, and sometimes bizarre flights of fancy, found in Longley's earlier poet ry when dealing with this kind of material are now honed to a more restrained, maturely confident manner. In the same way, when he invokes Homer, this is not a matter of high-spirited irony as in his first volume. No Continuing City, but of a rueful sense of identification with the fate of the weather-beaten Odysseus who finally returns to Ithaca - the personal affinity coming through poignantly, for instance, when in Longley's version he cradles Mike driftwood the bones of his dwindling father.' Longley, in LINEN HALL REVIEW SPRING 1992 PAGE 44</page><page sequence="2">POETRY PEACOCK fact, is emerging as an outstanding translator/imitator; and the mixture of translated sections of the Odyssey with personal glosses and additions in the sequence of Homer inspired poems in this volume is on the same level of achievement as 'Peace*, his adaptation of a Roman original (Tibullus) in The Echo Gate. The Homeric items, however, in Gorse Fires are above all part of a collection of lyric poems, Homer is represented in terms of key moments of (characteristically) recognition: plot-related recognitions in the original, but also luminous moments when Longley recognises in the text something which will mesh with his own concerns and temperament. Other correspondences and collocations may be found. The Second World War, for instance, is at one point invoked in a Japanese perspective in 'Geisha': Though the partition opens at a touch She makes a pin-hole and watches people Watching the sky where a heavy bomber Journeys to her mirror and jar of rouge. This cryptic poem is preceded by an equally concentrated four-line surreal fantasy on Eva Braun and the war-time V2s, then supplemented by a four-liner, 'Blitz', on (I take it) the nightmare realities of the Falls Road Baths on the night of Easter Tuesday, 1941 : They empty the swimming baths and lay out the dead. There are children who haven't learned to swim, bundled With budgerigars and tabbies under the stairs. Shockwaves are wrinkling the water that isn't there. The restraint of this poem is then followed by the muted, pared-down suggestiveness of Terezin*: No room has ever been as silent as the room Where hundreds of violins are hung in unison, Longley?s ability to refract human experience and suffering through these switching perspectives in poems of haiku-like concentration shot through with a generalised, not-parochial sympathy tokens the consistent priorities of the volume as a whole. It is a book of seasoned lyricism: the work of a poet who is facing squarely the demands of a life-long commitment to an exacting mode. In this sense it is reminiscent of the similar integrity of purpose shown by Philip Larkin, In its humane sympathies, its wide cultural frame of reference and its intimate sense of indi vidual commitment, Gorse Fires continue s the known constituents of Longley ^characteristic manner, but develops them with an austere, measured assurance. Darkly humorous, generous in sentiment, but uncompromising in its acknowledgement of suffering and mortality seen in primal terms, it is adistillation of complex experience through a hard-won technical virtuosity which can successfully disguise itself as nonchalance - the sure sign of a maturely developed lyric voice.
