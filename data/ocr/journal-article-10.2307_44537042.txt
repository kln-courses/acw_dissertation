Subject Area: First Aid AFTER THE OUCH 16mm/MP/14 min. /color/optical sound This is a delightful and interesting film directed to an intermediate grade level audience.

Animated, easily understood sketches present information on the body's reactions to the various injuries discussed. The viewer is warned not to try to treat serious injuries unless he or she has special first aid training. "Summon an adult" is the message, and a short vignette illustrates how to call for help by dialing the operator on the telephone. Available from Churchill Films, 1662 N. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90069. Subject Areas: Accident Prevention, Auto Safety UFO/UNRESTRAINED FLYING OBJECTS 16mm/MP/15 min./color/optical sound Twelve thousand people die unnecessarily each year in auto accidents; if these victims had been wearing seat belts, they would have not. This is an example of the type of infor- mation concerning seat belts which is brought out in this film. In addition, crash tests with anthropomorphic dummies are shown which dramatically illustrate what happens when a human body becomes an unrestrained flying object. The airbag and other passive restraint systems are also illus- trated and discussed. The film is available for free loan and is accompanied by a teacher's guide. Available from Public Relations Film Library, General Motors Corporation, Detroit, MI 48202.

This filmstrip series carries an antipollution message as part of an interesting tale of adventure and travel by an appealing character known as Dash McTrash. Dash's town, which is smoggy, dirty and polluted in other ways is taken over by monsters. Dash goes on a trip to discover how to rid his town of the monsters. During the trip, he finds out that pollution attracts the monsters and he then goes back, gets the people to clean up the town, and the monsters leave. There are several musical interludes and songs in the filmstrip. The closing frames show how the viewer can set up a Cleanup Club for his or her town. A teacher's manual, International Dash McTrash Cleanup Club Certificates, a set of "E" (for ecology) badges, a Dash McTrash coloring book, and words to the songs from the filmstrip are all in- cluded. These filmstrips are for a young audience, as you may have guessed, but they are excellent. Available from the Society for Visual Education, Inc., 1345 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, IL 60614. Subject Area: Appropriate Technology, International Health MODELS AND METHODS 16mm/MP/12 min./color/optical sound Appropriate technology is a concept which many interna- tional health projects are adopting. This film provides a basic introduction to this concept. Special projects used in an ex- perimental program at a mission station in Tanzania serve as specific examples. These do not deal with health projects per se, but the concepts of using local materials, local fuels, relatively simple devices, and village collaboration are applicable to any project. Appropriate technology is defined in the film as a non-violent technology. Appropriate technol- ogy uses "methods that are non-violent to people, to re- sources, and to the environment. . ." We could use some of that sort of technology right here. Available from Furman R. York, Mass Media Ministries, 2116 N.
