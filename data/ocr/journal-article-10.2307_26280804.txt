<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Narrative of the Appropriated Self: Chrétien de Troyes, D'Amors qui m'a tolu a moi, Stanza I Peter Haidu &lt;^^pHE PRESENT TEXT is extracted from an extended discussion ( / of one of the two lyric poems attributed with some certainty to Chrétien de Troyes. As such, it can figure as the "first" poem in French, a status which, though not without basis in textual chronology, is mainly of mythological importance. The fairly detailed discussion proceeds in semiotic terms to lead, finally, to a location of the textual codes in the socio-historical context of the 12th century. Before that conclusion is reached, however, each stanza is analyzed separately in recognition of the generally accepted critical perception that the stanza is the primary formal unit of the grand chant courtois. The pages that follow are the section concerned with the poem's first stanza, which lays the groundwork for the identification of recurrent structures and codes of importance for the analysis as a whole. 1 D'Amors, qui m'a tolu a moi N'a soi ne me veut retenir, 3 Me plaing ensi, qu'adés otroi Que de moi face son plesir. Et si ne me repuis tenir 6 Que ne m'en plaigne, et di por quoi : Car ceus qui la traïssent voi Souvent a lor joie venir 9 Et g'i fail par ma bone foi.1 A very simple critical operation in beginning to cope with difficulties of the text constitutes a recognition of the liberties Old French allows and Chrétien de Troyes takes with the syntactic structures of the lan The text is taken from Marie-Claire Zai, ed., Les Chansons courtoises de Chrétien de Troyes (Berne &amp; Frankfurt/M.: Lang &amp; Lang, 1974), Publ.

"Straightening the syntax" will render more palpable than they are on first sight the relations of determination in the Old French text : 1 [Je] me plaing d'Amors 2 qui m'a tolu a moi 3 n'a soi ne me veut retenir 4 ensi qu[e] 5 [j'] otroi 6 ades 7 que 8 [il] face son plesir de moi... oucn an unpretentious operational switcü already produces a nice ho mology between the semantic and syntactical levels. The semantic content of the quoted discourse reverses the relation of domination and subordination between the two actors in play, Amors and [Je\. It is [Je\ who initiates action at first, but Amors to whom the power of action is transferred by the end in the switch of first and third person pronouns in 11. 1 and 8. At the same time, however, this "straightened syntax" makes more obvious the paradoxical burden placed on the relational construct ensi qu[e]. Its fundamental semantic content is one of logical sequence: "so that, in such a manner that" the next step occurred.2 The basic relationship expected between the two clauses is a logical one which provides the dominant rhetorical structure of most of the stanzas of this text : if A, then B. The logic involved is more likely to be that of the enthymeme, an approximate logic drawn from rhetorica, than the more precisely honed logic of dialectica, a rough coordination of human actions and emotions rather than exact sequencing of abstract forms of thought, but its strength or implication of coherent sequentiality will prove a major structural element in the poem. This structure will be explicitly discussed in connection with the later stanzas. At this moment, it is important only to note the presence of a coherent logical principle within the structure of the lyric poem. Not as an imperative which must be followed, but as a mode of textual organization that has left at least some traces in the textual fabric, and one which is potentially capable of organizing texts as wholes. The present case is a prime 2.

It is possible that the expression [je] me plaing de is to be taken in the general emotional sense of "complain-about someone" or "regret." There is, however, a second meaning, both stronger and juridical in nature, of "lodging a legal complaint against someone."3 In either case, however, whether the speech act in question is a general one of com plaint or the more assertive act of lodging a legal complaint against someone, it presupposes that the speaker wants things changed.4 Further more, his speech act implies further events : his plainte will be heard, a judgment or decision will be rendered, the harmful activity will cease or compensation will be granted... The Subject has set in motion a sequence of events to which the Object may or may not respond. The point is that the domain of evenementiality is the domain of narrative : as soon as one starts talking about this text, whose lyric character is not in question, a narrative dimension immediately appears. Indeed, its essential ontological mode appears to be to indicate as many narrative potentials as possible, only to interrupt their evolution. Here, the ex pected narrative evolution as sketched out above is negated in the most fundamental manner possible short of interrupting the text itself: the plainte is characterized in such a manner as to contradict its basic semantic content. Where the essential character of the plainte, legal or not, is to limit and circumscribe the power of the Object, this plainte is such as to leave the world completely unchanged, for the Subject grants (otroi, hence, in utter freedom) the Object the power to dispose of him, the Subject, totally: [quit] face son plesir de moi, to do his pleasure with me. The specific illocutionary force is subtracted from The second meaning is dated by Godefroy as early 13th century, but it occurs already in Marie de France, contemporaneously with Chrétien : see Jean Rychner's edition of Lanval: Marie de France. Le Lai de Lanval (Geneva &amp; Paris: Droz &amp; Minard, 1958), 11. 309 f. and the commentary on p. 78. The context here, both immediate and extended, supports the juridical reading. The legal isotopy is specifically repeated in the following stanza (loi); in the present stanza, the verb in a parallel rhetorical position to plaing is also a verb of strong and binding illocutionary force, otroi. On the notion of presupposition, frequently used in this analysis, see Oswald Ducrot, Dire et ne pas dire: principes de sémantique linguistique (Paris : Hermann, 1972). On the presuppositional nature of narrative programatiza tion, see the remarks of A. J. Greimas, Maupassant; La sémiotique du texte: exercices pratiques (Paris: Seuil, 1976), p. 194.

The plaint against Amors is based on a dependent relative clause containing two specific ations. Amors took the Subject from himself, and does not wish to retain him : "D'Amors, qui m'a tolu a moi, n'a soi ne me veut retenir." As Greimas puts it in his Dictionnaire de l'ancien français, the coor dinating conjunction ne simultaneously joins the syntactic functions and disjoins the paradigmatic classes concerned. It is thus not one or the other of the two clauses that provides the Subject's case, it is their coordination. The paradigmatic classes concerned are interesting ones, particularly in this conjunction. The first clause, of course, is wilfully paradoxical : the alliteration qui M'a tolu a Moi underlines the paradox of having your self taken from yourself... and living to tell about it! Under the rhetorical figure, however, a curious structure appears, sep arating off the Subject as possessor (a moi) from the Subject as pos sessed (m'a). The Subject is given as having two aspects, one dominat ing, the other dominated. In any case, it is not either of the coordinating clauses that is the casus belli, but their coordination. Their superposition quickly eliminates the self as subject: only the self as object recurs in the two clauses. The two predicates are the vehicles for the crucial, dissociated par adigms. The first, toldre, is a primary verb, to take, to appropriate, to become possessor of and hence dominant over the object possessed. The second, retenir, is heavily laden with political and ideological values. At a primary level, it means, of course, to keep that which one has, or, in this particular case, that which one has taken. In this case, retenir presupposes toldre. The implication, at this level, is that appro priation might be justified if the appropriated self were to be retained and used. It is appropriation without redeeming utility that is unaccept able and leads to plaint. But retenir does not function on this primary level only. The lexeme serves also to connect the discourse of the text, in the very first stanza, to political structures that, at first sight, have little to do with the events or lyric emotions in question: retenir is 5.

Now, that a feudal vocabulary is invoked by the medieval love lyric in the courtly mode is hardly new.6 But the phenomenon has been relegated to the category of metaphoricity : it is considered ornamental and secondary in importance by comparison to the "substance" of the poem, namely an intense mode of human love. But metaphors are not created and invoked repeatedly with impunity. To use an older technical vocabulary, the tenor is enriched and, in the present case, even struc tured by the reference to a field of human life quite different from itself, that of the vehicle. Particularly if the field of the vehicle is invoked repeatedly, however, it, or an element common to it and to the tenor, may become the veritable theme of the text. In any case, the availability of the vehicle as vehicle for the structuration of a different field of textuality is itself telling. In the present case, two isotopies are con nected, that of love and that of the political structure of feudalism. The isotopic connector, the semic element common to both, is that of /dom ination/. That is a seme which has already been extracted from the text, and it is a seme that will recur. The insistent return of the political metaphor for the emotional content should alert us that what is perhaps at stake is that element they are supposed to share. If that is the case, what is in question in the text is the principle itself of domination and subordination, hence the principle of the hierarchy which is generally considered central to medieval thought and social structure. In the coordinated clauses that we are looking at, the discursive Subject reproaches the discursive Object (Amors) for asserting his/her domination inconsistently. In the case of toldre, the relationship of domination is asserted brutally, in the appropriation of the Self. In the case of retenir, however, the discursive Object is unwilling to assert domination. The result is the expulsion of the Self from the Self, its alienation both from the Object of desire and from itself as desiring Subject. The functioning of the relationship of domination is so erratic as to expel the discursive voice into a domain which is neither that of 6. See Roger Dragonetti, La Technique poétique des trouvères dans la chanson courtoise, contribution à l'étude de la rhétorique médiévale (Bruges, 1960; "Rijksuniversiteit te Gent-Werken uitgegeven door de Faculteit van de Let teren en Wijjsbegeerte"). Vol. XVIII, No. 3 23</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur the lived Subject nor that of Object: a position with only a name, a position with only a slot, an actant that is only a grammatical category.7 It should be noticed that this radical expulsion is attributed entirely to the actions of Amors, the actant we would normally consider the Object. It is the Object, here, which acts, and the Subject which pas sively receives the action: the Subject as Recipient, the Object as Destinator. Decidedly, the distribution of categories is paradoxical. As a result, categorical disembodiment seems to be the rule of the text. So far, the shape of the text we have been working on was given by the effort to understand the grammatical structure of the text, its relations of determination. Having accomplished that, let us proceed to another rewriting. We have already noted the presence of narrative elements in the text, largely in reaction to the assertions of Paul Zumthor that deny any narrative dimension to courtly lyric.8 What Zumthor, clearly one of the finest readers of medieval lyric, really means, of course, is that narration is not the principle of holistic textual orga nization, by comparison to the ballade or the pastourelle, for instance. He makes frequent references to "actions humaines" (p. 200), "l'histoire puieiiuene u une reiauon entre re sujet et r uojet tp. zuzj, uiscours narratif" (p. 210), and his valuable remarks on the verbs in the lyrics (p. 228) suggest the presence of a variety of elements belonging to the evenemential category. It is possible to extend the analysis of the narrative elements that are present, and in force, by recasting the text in the order of a logic of anthropomorphic actions, as follows: 1 Amors m'a tolu a moi 2 " ne veut me retenir a soi 3 [Je] me plaing d'Amors [on account of 1-2] 4 ensi qu[e] [=in the expectation that the result of line 3 will bring the following] 5 [ele] face son plesir de moi [ : ] 6 [she will do (1 + 2) again] 7 [I will lodge my complaint again]. According to this rewriting — and any such rewriting comports an inter pretation— the first four lines of this strophe contain a circular and 7. On actantial theory, see Greimas, Sémantique structurale, 2nd ed. (Paris: Larousse, 1969), pp. 172-91; "La structure des actants du récit," in Du sens (Paris: Seuil, 1970); and "Les actants, les acteurs et les figures," in Sémio tique narrative et textuelle, ed. Claude Chabrol (Paris: Larousse, 1973). 8 Essai de poétique médiévale (Paris: Seuil, 1972), pp. 189, 192, et passim. 24 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="7">Haidu self-annihilating narrative, in which the end brings the course of evene mentiality back to the beginning. Is there any textual support for such an interpretation? In fact, the bracketed sequences [6] and [7] above seem merely a narrative syntagmatization of the general paradigmatic statement actually contained in the poem: ... ceus qui la trai'ssent voi Souvent a lor joie venir Et g'i fail par ma bone foi. Stated as a general rule, this paradigm must generate the same narrative play-out every time it is put into action: the same program will play over and over again. Indeed, the discursive subject is also programmed for repetition. In spite of the immediately prior abandonment of the appropriated self to the pleasure of the feudal appropriator, he begins his plaint again, and stresses its repetitive character: Et si ne me repuis tenir Que ne m'en plaigne... ine implication nere is tnat repetition is onerous, tnat tne preceding speech act, if it exercises its proper illocutionary force, ought to preclude such repetition. The grant (otroi) is, after all, also a speech act, and its illocutionary force ought to be sufficiently effective to settle and close the situation for good. That it does not demonstrates the circular ity of the structure and its narrative base. The text itself continues by offering as an observed fact the principle that good fails and evil wins: ... ceus qui la traïssent voi Souvent a lor joie venir Et g'i fail par ma bone foi. Thus, at the position marked [6] and [7] in the narrative analysis above, in which a recurrence of the cycle in which the Object turns into an anti-Subject was predicated, the text itself affirms the general rule of the inversion of expected narrative results : the bad win ; the good lose. An unexpected result of the narrative rewriting of the text is that, as against the syntactical straightening process, which shifted the textual elements around a good deal, the narrative rewriting in fact returns the textual elements to their original order. That is to say that the nar Vol. XVIII, No. 3 25</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur rative order and the rhetorical order are closer to each other than either is to the syntax of the discourse. Put another way: Chrétien de Troyes' rhetoric, in the writing of lyric poetry, is closer to a narrative grammar than to a linguistic grammar. This leads to a conclusion similar to that reached earlier, in our discussion of the isotopies at play in the text. The apparent theme of the text may not be its real concern: the dy namics of narrative bring in questions of values that are also the con cern of anthropology and sociology. In narrative theory, the major axis of the narrative is that which links the Subject of action to the Object of action in the relationship of desire. It is to satisfy the desire that action is undertaken, and the action of the narrative continues until the quest for the satisfaction of desire is concluded, satisfactorily or not. The unattainment of the goal of narrative and the nonfulfillment of the narrative quest are evidently major characteristics of this text, that only a narrative theory (the one employed here or another) can allow the critic to formulate. Another kind of assertion, of major importance to discussions of the lyric, is also possible only in terms of a narrative theory of actions. The general absence of metaphor and images in the text, entities that could be trans lated into static, non-narrative qualifying statements, forces the critic to deal with the actantial role of the Subject as the subject of narrative actions. The Subject's role as victimized Object of the Object's action in the very opening lines of the poem is a paradoxical inversion that appropriately introduces a text of contradictions. The semantic content of that syntactical inversion, the separation of the self from the self, the Subject from the Subject, introduces an internal alienation that is textualized only in narrative terms: there is no indication of what part of the Subject has been removed, what part of the Subject remains, though some such distribution into two categories would appear to be inevitable if the first line of the poem is to retain any meaning at all. It is only qua narrative, however, that this internal division exists in this lyric. Furthermore, it is only in this narrative dimension that one can describe a further shift of some importance to the text. Narrative theory unites Subject and Object in a relation of desire. In the present case, however, the narrative dimension puts the Subject into a some what different role than that of the amant couart typical of courtly lyric. In addition to the evident negative judgment of the Object, the latter's aggression against the Subject is answered by another aggres sion, modulated by the legal category, insofar as the lover's plainte is 26 Fall 1978</page><page sequence="9">H AI DU considered to be, in fact, a legal complaint.
