<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Staging of the Assumption in Europe J. Francese Massip One of the most widely used plots in the late medieval religious theater - and one that offers perhaps the greatest variety of staging - throughout European countries is the Death and Assumption of the Virgin Mary. There are, of course, numerous and different staging solutions to the scénographie problems presented by this and other stories in different regions of the continent. Interestingly, in contrast to Northern Europe where the mythological past had been marked by terrible deities with a resulting tendency for drama to emphasize scenes of hell and its devils, the South, where the cultural background had been a previous classical mythology with an anthropomorphic and gentle Olympus, preferred displays involving Paradise and using bold aerial machines. These are two different theatrical emphases, both of which express from opposite cultural bases the great messages of the Christianity that after all had come into being as a religion within the classical Roman world. A survey of the abundant surviving texts of the Assumption plays and of the numerous dramatic records of such drama in Europe will be adequate for a preliminary classification system in which five different types of staging may be designated: (1) ecclesiastical staging with horizontal arrangement; (2) urban staging on horizontal and fixed stages; (3) ecclesiastical staging with a vertical arrangement; (4) urban staging on a movable and linear stage; and (5) urban staging on a fixed vertical stage. 1. Ecclesiastical Staging with a Horizontal Arrangement. Representations of the Assumption seem to have had their inception as plays inside churches possibly no earlier than the thirteenth century. They had developed from liturgical acts that, with expressive dramatic rudiments, took place on the feast of the Assumption (15 August). Some of these early 17</page><page sequence="2">18 The Staging of the Assumption examples have survived to the present time under different forms, as for instance in the case of the procession for the burial of the Virgin and preparation of her deathbed. 1 But an exclusively liturgical farcita epistle, consisting of ninety-four lines in Latin and in langue ďoil, of the second half of the thirteenth century has been preserved.2 A lauda of Perugia is to my knowledge one of the earliest theatrical representations of the Assumption. It can be dated to the last years of the thirteenth century and consists of 160 verses in the vernacular. 3 This first Umbrian attempt is hardly surprising in view of the powerful influence that the local Franciscans seem to have exerted upon the beginnings of the vernacular theater in the Romance language areas.4 The sur- viving fragments of the Amorbach drama can, however, be placed at approximately the same time. This drama, which ends with the funeral procession of the Virgin interrupted by the Jews, is written in Latin and archaic German and additionally possesses musical notation.5 No record of the staging of these examples survives, nor is there any such evidence available for the Orvieto play of La Rappresentazione de Santa Maria d'Agostob - another Umbrian lauda of 410 lines in length from the fourteenth century which may have been performed inside a church building. The only totally preserved liturgical Assumption of Mary drama in Latin and with extant music that has been preserved is the one that was staged, at least in the early fourteenth century, inside the monastic church of Sta. Maria de l'Estany. The performance took place between the choir and the altar of the romanesque church using a purely horizontal layout and with dialogues and action very similar to the staging of the traditional Visitatio SepulchriJ However, the Assumption dra- mas performed in the cathedral of Mallorca at the end of the fourteenth century - plays including at least twelve fully cos- tumed apostles, wearing gilded tinplate crowns, and seven winged angelsS - must have been more spectacular than the plays noted above. The first Castillian dramatic text based on the Assumption appears to have been the play staged around 1509 in the church of the Franciscan nuns' convent of Sta. Maria de la Cruz at Toledo. The play was performed on a single but spacious scaffold with at least two levels connected by stairs. The higher level was reserved for heaven with God the Father</page><page sequence="3">/. Francese Massip 19 on the highest ceremonial chair and the angelic hierarchies on others. The lower level represented the earth, specifically the location of the house and the tomb of the Virgin.9 This scaffold presumably stood in the transept in front of the presbytery, which is a privileged location for these types of ceremonies even today. In the Church of St. Andreu de la Selva del Camp at Tarragona since 1980 the first Catalonian Assumption drama (see below) has been revived in a production that uses the entire interior of the building: hell is placed in the entry, the tomb on a higher level in the transept, and Mary's home in the presbytery, while at the back of the presbytery and elevated at the end of a staircase is Paradise. The aisles are used for movement and for processions .10 Unfortunately, there is no information available about the staging of the Rhenish Himmelfart Maria of 1391 preserved at Innsbruck, but it appears to have been ecclesiastical and to have used a horizontal arrangement for staging. H 2. Urban Staging on a Horizontal and Fixed Stage. The first great dramatizations were not, however, produced in the sacred space inside the church. They were instead performed in the most commonly used urban setting, the public square or plaza, normally the nerve center of city life and meeting point of the community. 12 It so happens that the earliest surviving text, which is also accompanied by records which illuminate its actual staging, is the Representado de VAssumpció de Madonna Sancta Maria, a Catalan drama produced on the Plaza del Corral at Tarragona in 1388.13 In the municipal archives at Tarragona there is abundant evidence of other communal activities in the same plaza - e.g., entertainments, fairs, tournaments - since it was the largest space in the city and actually was located at the spot where there had been placed the arena of the ancient Roman circus which had space for 23,000 people. This circus, in fact, was still partly standing in the Middle Ages, and we are reminded that it was common practice in France and Italy and perhaps also England to re-use various buildings of antiquity such as amphitheaters for medieval dramas. 14 It seems that in Tarragona the circus was incorporated into the scheme for the Assumption play, but also barraques were built - structures that will remind us of the double-storied scaffolding in the famous miniature by Jean Fouquet. Also at Tarragona, as in the minia- ture of St. Apollonia by the scenographer Fouquet, these</page><page sequence="4">20 The Staging of the Assumption barraques were used by both the audience and the actors. For example, the actors who represented the council of the Jews installed themselves within a bella borracha ("beautiful scaf- fold"), while the members of the city council watched the performance from another richly adorned scaffold that had been especially built for them. The Virgin's house must have been placed also in a similar cubiform structure with a bell horatori ("beautiful oratory") in front. Other actors are assigned to normal places {lochs) - hell, paradise, the tomb - which appear to have been placed on pre-existent structures, the remains of the Roman circus and nearby buildings. Any totally new structure for the stage setting was identified as a casa (house) or a barracha (scaffold). 15 As noted above, members of the audience occupied seating on scaffolds, but also were seated on the galleries and rows of the circus. Thus the ancient amphitheater, which had become a multifunctional open space for performances, markets, fairs, and executions, had given to the city a suitable spot for its collective rites and would also be transformed into a place where the urban society could demonstrate its prestige. 16 Hence the city council subsidized the drama with twenty gold florins and also lent clothing and equipment for the actors. On the day of the performance it is reported that the entire city of Tarragona was at the play to look {era là per mirar), and guards were posted to keep the peace. 17 The Assumption at Tarragona is also perhaps the first play in Europe to include a scene, in this case very humorous, with devils and scenery of hell. Inside of hell there was a great din {gran brogit), produced by the clanging of hammers on anvils, and there was also a strong stench made by the burning of brimstone Л 8 Another representation of the Assumption, with all its magnificence, took place in the middle of the fifteenth century for the first time in the Grote Markt (or Nedermerct) of Brussels. This play was the seventh and last of a set of plays (couplets) in honor of the Virgin presented in Flemish each year until 1566. In this play, as at Tarragona, appear little devils, and on the whole the staging must have been very similar to the Spanish dramatization. In 1549 a Spanish chronicler reported seeing the fourth play in the set. Besides describing the market place as "enclosed by many platforms richly embellished," he specified that the drama was played "on a platform built in the manner</page><page sequence="5">/. Francese Massip 21 of a coliseum" in front of the splendid Gothic town hall from which the more important authorities and their retinue watched Л 9 This square was, of course, also surrounded by the proud and rich guildhalls of the city, thus emphasizing and projecting the prestige of the city's bourgeoisie. 3. Ecclesiastical Staging with a Vertical Arrangement. As I understand it, maturity arrives for medieval staging with the adoption of verticality for its arrangement of space. Experi- mentation with verticality was attempted at least as early as the late fourteenth century20 and reached its peak during the next century inside the church but through a kind of re-insertion of the great urban drama, which had adopted the vernacular Romance languages, into the sphere of sacred space within ecclesiastical buildings. Such arrangements gave a special effec- tiveness to dramatizations of the Ascension of Christ and the Assumption of the Virgin.21 The mystery presented at the cathedral at Valencia which dates from the fifteenth century comes down to us in a frag- mentary text but containing rubrics and augmented with records which indicate its manner of staging.22 This play is so far as we know the first to have used an elevated Paradise with aerial machines connecting it to the scenic space on the ground. This Catalan drama was presented in the main locations within the cathedral: the choir, via sacra, transept, and presbytery, in which a scaffold (cadafal) with Mary's tomb and home was placed. Overhead from the magnificent dome covered with canvas the araceli and peanya carrying the images of the angels and Christ were let down, and afterward the statue of the Virgin was lifted up to the same exalted level designated as heaven.23 It was a model staging technique in Southern Europe and must no doubt have inspired subsequent productions in Lleida (1497), 24 Vila-Real (1513-14), Castello (sixteenth century), other Castillian locations in the fifteenth century, and, above all, Elche where the Assumption drama is still enacted to this day. These dramas already would include the use of flesh and blood actors on top of the aerial devices.25 In the church of Carmine at Florence, a city which during the fifteenth century was the great capital of Mediterranean theater and entertainment, the Compagnia dell'Agnese produced, at least after 1455, an Assumption play using the aerial ma-</page><page sequence="6">22 The Staging of the Assumption chinery originally designed by the architect Francesco d'Angelo (il Cecca) for the Ascension of Christ.26 Together with the Italian peninsula and the Crown of Aragon, ancient Occitania was another great focal point for Assumption drama, which was commonly staged in a religious rather than urban setting and using flying devices that lifted up statues. Before 1442 such devices seem to have been used in the church of St. James of Montauban, where there is also record of a procession in which dancing and jesting characters called barbastales took part.27 This model must be indebted to the capital of Languedoc, Toulouse, where at around the same time the Montament de Nostra Dona was enacted in the two churches of La Daurade and St. Stephen using complicated devices on which the images of the Virgin and seven angels were hauled up to the dome by means of a rope twelve meters long. We know, in any case, that the Mystère de Г Ascension de la Vierge, the earliest French text of an Assumption play, is dated 1452 and that its provenance is Toulouse. This drama presents scenes of devils, Jews, the apostle St. Thomas receiving Mary's girdle, and the Coronation. The Tolosan productions probably influenced the Montament recorded at Rabastens, which had an elevating machine, restored in 1501, that was made up of two wheels, the higher one symbolizing the sun and its rays and having brackets where nine angel figures stood. Under the sun and inside the smaller wheel there were five shelves that contained four angels along with the image of the Virgin between them, and there were five additional shelves on the outside which also contained images of angels. The wheels turned in opposite directions, but the images placed on them remained stationary, standing and looking upward toward para- dise. In the last century, similar ceremonies were enacted in the Abbey of St. Peter at Moissac, and the images and the machinery still existed in the 1960's.28 Though it was more common in Southern Europe, this type of staging was not an exclusive heritage of the Mediter- ranean world. Normandy possesses records of similar drama- tizations taking place during the Feast of the Assumption in August: the mitouries or miault (the demi-août). After 1443 at the Church of St. James at Dieppe the Assumption was celebrated on two successive days. On the vigil of the feast of the Assumption, the Death of the Virgin was represented on a scaffold in front of the Hôtel-de- Ville with a scene showing</page><page sequence="7">/. Francese Massip 23 the intervention of the Jews. Then on 15 August, Mary's funeral procession went through the town until it reached the church, where the coffin was placed at the presbytery. During the Mass the Virgin's image, accompanied by angels, was raised slowly up to Paradise; as it ascended, the image moved its articulated arms and face upward to the vaulted heaven, which was con- structed of blue cloth and garnished with gilded stars. At the same time from the summit puppet-angels with trumpets and a carrillon played mechanically the chant of Ave Maria, and gathered around the figure of God the Father who blessed and crowned the Virgin Mary. During the solemn ceremony, how- ever, a clownish character called Grimpesulais or Gringalet appeared and, acting out of ecclesiastical control, mimicked the mechanical gestures of the ascending image. 29 Similar stage machinery was used to stage the Assumption at neighboring Cherbourg - a very detailed drawing of this machinery is ex- tant30 - ancj at the cathedral at Rouen. 31 Assumption ceremonies using stage machinery appear to have been mounted at two Northern European locations quite distant from each other. At Lincoln at least from 1458-59 a "Ludum siue serimonium de assumpeione siue coronacione beate marie"32 took place on St. Anne's day in the cathedral and also after 1483 played some part in a civic procession on that feast day.33 in 1459-60 a priest named John Hanson was paid for his services "circa assumpcionem et visus factos in ecclesia in festo sánete Anne. "34 It has been suggested that this ceremony could be related to the text of the N-town plays,35 though recent research has shown that this play cycle is from East Anglia rather than Lincoln.36 Then, at Halle in Germany (formerly in the D.D.R.) in the sixteenth century an image of the Virgin was taken in procession around the city prior to being lifted up with ropes until it disappeared through the roof of the church. Accompanying this action was the chanting of liturgical music of a monophonie nature.37 At the end of the last century, the Sicilian village of Cani- catti still enacted the Assumption of the Virgin on 15 August at the church, inside of which, as at Elche, Maria "sopra grandi nuvole si solleva in alto, raggiante di luce divina" and "dicono che il bello dello spettacolo sia quello delle nuvole. "38 4. Urban Staging on a Movable and Linear Stage. A new type of staging that perhaps started with the royal entrances</page><page sequence="8">24 The Staging of the Assumption and other pomps of court took shape apparently in the period between the establishment of the feast of Corpus Christi in 1264 and its official institution in 1316. The urban procession of the Eucharist on this feast turned the entire city into a theatrical setting. By the latter part of the fourteenth century productions are recorded in such cities as York where pageant wagons were paraded through the streets and in a sense made up what might be called a linear and traveling stage. Various segments of biblical history were partially or completely dramatized on these carriages at several stations through the city and using more or less complex staging techniques. Among the scenes were the Death, Assumption, and Coronation of the Virgin which at York were presented in three separate pageants.39 It is also known that there was a fourth pageant representing the Funeral of the Virgin which included the attack on her bier by the Jew, who was here called Fergus; this play, however, apparently fell into disuse because, among other reasons, it caused people to respond inappropriately with laughter and shouting.40 Other locations such as Chester, Beverley, and Newcastle also mounted Assumption pageants as part of a larger cycle for either Corpus Christi or Whitsun week celebrations. Such pageants could also be mounted as part of civic pageantry on other occasions, and for the entrance of the Emperor Charles V into London in 1552 there had been set up a pageant wagon on which the Assumpta (Virgin), together with a cloud, was lifted up into a scenic sky that included sun, moon, and stars.41 In Toledo, the Corpus Christi procession of 1493 displayed a wagon with the Assumption, whereas in the sixteenth century in Seville a certain "Auto de la Asunción de Nuestra Señora" was enacted on two separate wagons.42 In Florence the feast of St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the city, was cele- brated with great solemnity and including a procession in which the Assumption was included. Siena also honored Emperor Charles V with a wagon representing the same subject.43 In Brussels, preceding the already mentioned dramatizations honoring the Virgin, was a procession of thirteen carriages. On one of these the Assumption was apparently also presented with the assistance of an elevating device: "It was a beautiful maiden dressed in white satin, surrounded by many angels and singing very softly while she was raised into heaven."44 5. Urban Staging on a Fixed Vertical Stage. One final</page><page sequence="9">/. Francese Massip 25 arrangement of Assumption of the Virgin staging may be noted: an outdoors fixed stage that uses elevating devices, evidently less complicated than those in churches but fully as efficient. In 1458 in Siena's Piazza del Campo, in the presence of the recently-elected Pope Pius П who was a native of the region, there was an enactment of Mary's ascent to Paradise, which was probably located for the purposes of the play on the top of the Palazzo della Signoria. And the same scene was enacted four years later at the city square in Viterbo.45 The use of a fixed stage and a vertical arrangement was also present in the English N-town cycle in the play of the Assumption, which specifies the descent of an angel and, following the return of Mary's soul to her body, her ascent along with the angel to heaven to the accompaniment of music: "Et hic assendent in celum cantanti- bus organis"46 The great Mystère des Actes des Apôtres of the Greban brothers was first staged in the Roman amphitheater of Avari- cum at Bourges in the year 1536. In this drama one of the rubrics specifies that Mary is to be lifted up with a device that would stop at a certain altitude so that she could converse with St. Thomas - an episode that is repeated in the Elche Assump- tion play - and offer him her girdle.47 As a final example, when the Americas were colonized in the sixteenth century, Spanish staging models were exported over the sea. Already in 1538, at the church square at Tlaxcala, Mexico, an Assumption using an aerial contrivance was pro- duced^ with the roles played entirely by Indians and with the dialogue in Nahuatl.49 NOTES i See the surveys of Assumption processions by Josep Romeu i Figueras, "El teátre assumpcionista de tècnica medieval als Països Catalans," Miscellània Aramon i Serra, 4 (1984), 239-78, and in Teátre Assumpcionista cátala, ed.

Mone, Altdeutsche Schauspiele (Leipzig, 1841). 12 Most references to fourteenth-century Catalan religious plays state that their enactments in the streets were celebrations organized by the civil population in col- laboration with the ecclesiastics. Everything seems to suggest that the lavish and complicated medieval stagings- the so-called mysteries - originated in the public square. Not until the fifteenth century does the Church accept them inside the more spacious churches. In attempting to understand the questions raised by these develop- ments, it may be necessary not to forget the authentic professional entertainers - minstrels, mimes, and professional fools or buffoons, whose many-sided activities continued from antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages. Though records are sparse, one may speculate that such entertainers had some part in plays and religious festivi- ties even inside the churches. Further, they very likely engaged in the recitation of biblical history and legends in the streets as additions to their repertoire. They may have had a role in the birth of the great Passion dramas; see J. Francese Massip, "Les primeres dramatizacions de la Passio en llengua catalana," D'Art, 13 (1987), 253-68. We should not forget the Corpus Christi processions that embodied dramatic produc- tions along their routes; these were organized chiefly by the laymen - the guilds and brotherhoods - with considerable professional participation. 13 See J.
