<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHEL BENAMOU Romantic Counterpoint: Nature and Style Nature, for the modern European writer, has lost its hold on the intellect, the sensibility and the imagination. Perhaps Darwin is to blame, or Hegel. Perhaps it is more a matter of style. Anyhow, "one looks in vain for landscapes in great European fiction since Dostoiev- sky." Such was Camus' opinion in 1954. He is, of course, the ex- ception. Germaine Bree has illuminated the part played by the Al- gerian landscape in his novels. Its presence is felt even in The Fall, through the myth of the Greek islands. As to the intellect, The Rebel's revolt is bred by the tension between history and nature. The ques- tion remains: why Camus alone? Suppose it is a question which concerns style. The Romantics humanized nature and that was the pathetic fallacy. Darwin helped Ruskin to prove it was wrong. Nature is mindless. And yet "if man realized that the universe like him can love and suffer, he would be reconciled" (The Myth of Sisyphus). The nostalgia for unity is not absent from Camus' style. W. M. Frohock has brilliantly demon- strated its affinity with Giono's nature imagery (Y.F.S. No. 4). But these Neo-Romantic leanings clash with Camus' criticism of anthro- pomorphic thought as well as with his repeated distinction between poetry and truth: the "poetic sob" makes me forget "the truth of the world," the great lesson of nature's non-human otherness (Noces, "Le desert"). In short the question of Camus' style ties in with the ambiguity of his attitude to nature, which he once acknowledged as an enigma: Where is the absurdity of the world? ... With so much sun within my memory, how could I bet on meaninglessness? People about me wonder at this and I do too sometimes. I could answer them and myself that the sun contributed to this, and that its light is so thick that it coagulates the universe and its shapes into dazzling darkness. (L'Ete, "L'enigme") Camus' enigma lies here before us, concentrated in the final oxy- moron, inviting attention to the inner force which produces such startling metaphors as an answer to a philosophical question. 44</page><page sequence="2">MICHEL BENAMOU THE UNTHINKING SOURCE It is possible to overestimate the sensuousness of an image, but this metaphor, the sun "coagulates the universe" clearly establishes the need for a study of Camus' sensory perceptions through his imagery. The obvious place to look is the autobiographical essay, Noces, and its companion piece of twenty years later, L'tet. Take together they present an inordinately high proportion of tactile images, 30.4 per- cent by actual count, as against 43.3 percent of visual, which is all the more significant in view of the strong visual bias of metaphorical language. Respiratory and olfactory images account for an impressive 9.5 percent. Even so "tactile" a poet as Keats, whose vision is con- stantly enhanced by touch, comes out of Folge's tally with a 40.1 percent visual, 20.7 percent tactile and 1.7 percent olfactory group- ing.' These facts quantify what we sensed in metaphors similar to that of the sun just cited: that touch is the privileged sense through which Camus "knows" and interprets the world. In a necessarily selective essay, we must limit ourselves to this noteworthy point. The eye establishes a distance to the object, but in the experience of contemplation it merges feeling and focus. The religions have realized this. "At the Eleusinian mysteries, it was enough to behold." But for Camus it was not enough: touch must heighten sight. Right here I know that I shall never draw close enough to the world . . . At Tipasa, I see equals I believe and I do not per- sist in denying what I can touch with my hand and caress with my lips. (Noces) To him epidermic contact with nature is a revelation. The ritual of crushing the wormwood plants and then diving into the warm sea performs a double ministry of union. The swimming body becomes a nexus of elements: the sea clasping the earth-scented diver, the sun tanning his water-lackered arm, seal the unity of man with nature. Noces, the wedding. It is no mystic ecstasy, because a predominantly epidermic experience of integration cannot dissociate body-conscious- ness from world-consciousness (Cf. Katz, Der Aufbau der Tastwelt, and Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenologie de la perception, p. 362-365). The withdrawal from circumference to centre which characterizes the mystic's rapture cannot take place. Neither is it anything like Rousseau's ecstasy in nature, a state of visual and auditory hypnosis releasing a disembodied sentiment of existence. For while Rousseau's 'Special acknowledgements are due to four of my students, Bruce Lacoss, Onno Leyds, James O'Brien, Jr., and Donald Webb, who garnered statistics on the sensory types and anthropomorphic function of Camus' imagery in Noces, L'ELte, L'1tranger, La Peste, La Chute and L'Exil et le royautne. L'Envers et 1'endroit was deliberately left out as not meeting Camus' stylistic standards (cf. the preface to the 1954 edition). 45</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies "Reverie" becomes an abstract disquisition on time and happiness, Camus' style conveys poetically a sense of happiness through a number of sensual images, partly sexual, mainly tactile. What would happen if, instead of the pleasures of swimming, the experience were one of pain? is a question answered in "Le Vent a Djemilla." The wind blows so fiercely that it upsets the body- scheme of the world: I was hollowed out at the center, with my eyes burning, my lips cracking, my skin dried until it felt no longer mine. It used to be my means of deciphering the world's writing ... But I had been chafed by the wind so long . . . that I was losing consciousness of the design of my body. With epidermic perception almost erased, an hallucination of ubiquity, normally prevented by body-consciousness and tactile coordinates, identifies the self with the world: Soon, blown to the four corners of the world, forgetful, forgetting myself, I am this wind and in the wind these columns and this arch, these flagstones feeling hot and these pale mountains round the deserted city. And never have I felt to such a degree both remote from myself and present to the world. The Romantic discovers his own emotions projected into landscapes. But those are "the most vulgar." Selfless, Camus becomes "a stone amid the stones." His is the revelation of nonhuman nature: perceiving that the world is "dense," sensing to what a degree a stone is foreign and irreducible to us, with what intensity nature or a landscape can negate us . . . that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd. (The Myth of Sisyphus) Camus' double intuition of the world, nourished by his sensory per- ceptions, is that "happiness and absurdity are two sons of the same earth." (ibid.) Both stem from a dual experience of pleasure and pain, which is primarily tactile. Hence the metaphors, and their deep-seated originality. This is the unthinking source: it fills Camus' prose with images through which flow the opposite themes of union and separation. It spreads between his thought and his poetic universe a network of cogency, visible in the imagery. 46</page><page sequence="4">MICHEL BENAMOU THE POETIC UNIVERSE Thickness, impenetrable density, weight, tactile pain (heat, cold, wounds, skin diseases, the Bubonic Plague) are the physical dimens- ions of the absurd. Fluidity, penetrability by man's body, moderate warmth and coolness, any pleasurable contact, are of the essence of Being, which is Well-Being. (Those familar with Bachelard's works will recognize the last formula; I owe a great debt to his studies of the material imagination). Such seems to be the basic structure of Camus' symbolism. His are the symbolic forms of the dense sun, the gasping universe, the liquid light. Those images, a few hundred in all, recur severally as typical motifs. An exhaustive study of their appearances would probably show that they are generated by cliches ("(7a cogne," pica tape dur") gradually revitalized by means of the corresponding "sunken" sense perception. They take their heightened meaning from what I called "the unthinking source." In Camus' hierarchy of elements, the mineral kingdom varies from neutrality to hostility. Ariadne's stone, in L'Ete, imparts the "tender indifference" of the world" and gives a lesson of inhumanism akin to Robinson Jeffers' desert-inspired teaching. A stone is nothing but repose, respite from human passions. Its potential use as a prison de- pends on man. Combined with metal in cities it isolates man from nature. Oran, in The Plague as well as in L'1te, represents man-made absurdity turning its back on natural beauty. Prague is the labyrin. thine metropolis of incommunicability; Paris the archetypal cavern of Hades as much as it is Plato's, New York "a pit of stone and steel in which I choked " ("La Mer au plus pres"). Amsterdam marks the topographical actualization of these recurrent images of Hell, but its horror makes less impression on our imagination than the prayer of the Renegade, whose image has something of Dante's city of Dis, the sealed furnace of heat without light: Let the kingdom come when in a single city of salt and iron, dark tyrants will enslave and possess us pitilessly. (Exile and the Kingdom) We note the steady movement of amplification and heightening of the symbol. The paradox of the city as prison and separation, while the stone-desert liberates (at the end of "The Adulteress" for instance) has its roots in a physical sensation rather than in Baudelairian themes which only add counterpoint. The sun "coagulates the world." As such, it is the element of the absurd. Camus, who is the poet of evening, distinguishes between the midday sun and other forms of light. But there is no ambiguity about the sun in The Stranger. It is responsible for Meursault's crime on the beach, not only because it befuddles his brain, or because its flash on 47</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies the Arab's knife gives him a tactile hallucination of being stabbed (Mr. Frohock's convincing analysis), but also because it makes the world thick, and man's behavior meaningless: When Raymond gave me his gun, the sun flared on it. Yet, we remained still as though everything had closed in on us . . . I thought at that moment that one might shoot or not shoot. Such was the heat that it was painful to remain still in the blinding rain falling from the sky. To stay or go made no difference. I thought I only had to turn back and it would be all over. But a whole beach vibrating with sunshine pressed against my back. The midday sun intervenes in human affairs mostly by its weight, its heat, its density, and when reflected by deadly weapons. Beside the flash on the gun and on the knife, there is only one suggestion of this in The Stranger: the sun-sword. But in the next novel, the image is resumed and fortified. The sun of the plague pursues the people in the street and strikes them. It becomes the overwhelming symbol of "The Renegade," forged into an arsenal for sacrificial torture by a demonic imagination which, were it not for the humor of the tale, would recall Lautreamont. It is the sun of exile, "forbidding any contact between men," separating them "by a portcullis of invisible flames and of searing crystals." We note the same experience of the materialization of the air by the sun as in The Stranger, but the theme of separation has emerged from all these metallic images as the scourge of a civilization. The myth of the salt city, the recurrence of weapons, the density of all things in the heat, show how the ma- terial imagination of Camus welds elements into a new syntax of the absurd. If thickness determines the poetics of absurdity, the tactile trans- parence of water fosters the forms of happiness. The central ex- perience of fluidity, swimming, is a lived metaphor uniting us with the elements. Not only Meursault's swim with Marie, or Tarrou's communion with Rieux in sea-bathing, but the very nostalgia of swimming in The Fall testify to the pervasiveness of the theme. In praise of water, Camus makes it alternately an image of sexual union and that of man's baptism. His are not the defiant shouts of Byron or Swinburne. Mediterranean waters are warm and soothing. The sym- bols of happiness have the qualities of a universe which at certain hours does welcome man back to the primeval ooze. But these epiphanies do not alone account for Camus' water sym- bolism. It floods his poetic universe whenever "the sky opens its 48</page><page sequence="6">MICHEL BENAMOU fountains of light in the immense and sonorous space" (L'Atg). Such a metaphor as this, a bit cloyed with synaesthesias, a little pompous, the weaker side of Chateauoriand, becomes, from Noces to Exile and the Kingdom, a stylistic addiction. But the very repeti- tion of the formulas of the liquid light sugests something different from mere decoration. They have a metastylistic value. Gestures in a ceremonial do not require much variation. Such appear to be the recurrent images of light, fulfilling the same materialization of hap- piness as the rites of sea-bathing. On the contrary, solidified light forbids union. The doves that crowd the sky of Amsterdam and hal- lucinate Clamence (The Fall) may carry, in addition to an obvious religious meaning, a theme of repulsive sensations corresponding to his nostalgia of water and light. Water is nature penetrable by man. Immersion means a conversion: of the universe from thickness to fluidity and of man when he be- comes penetrable by the water of night. Strange is the imagery which conveys Meursault's discovery of Values, just before the day of his execution: Sounds rose toward me from the countryside. Smells of night, earth, and salt cooled my temples. The marvellous peace of the slumbering summer entered me like a tide. In L'Ete, Camus speaks of the water of night. It is the water of man's reconciliation, chthonian, seminal, also present throughout the ex- perience of cosmic union when Janine, thus turned an Adulteress, discovers the kingdom: In front of her, stars fell, one by one, then flickered out among the stones of the desert, and each time Janine opened up a little more to the night. She was breathing, forgetting the cold, the weight of beings, life insane or solidified, the long anguish of living and dying. . . At the same time, she felt as though she had found her roots again, the sap rose again in her body, she was no longer shivering ... Then with unbear- able softness, the water of night began to fill Janine, welling up from the obscure centre of her being and overflowing to her moaning mouth like an unbroken flood. Camus shares with Rene Char a tactile and gustatory appreciation of night's liquid softness. He keeps in abeyance the Romantic sym- bolism of the water of night, which is deathlike. Yet the correspond- ence between outer night and the obscure centre strikes a Romantic note, as does the comparison of Janine to a plant receiving sap from the earth. The kingdom is a peculiar experience of physical unity. It derives its extraordinary poignancy from a poetic language secreted 49</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies out of Camus's symbolic universe. He emerges out of our study of his material imagination as a poet of elemental water, in the three forms of sea, sunlight and night. As such he is the poet of inner and outer immersion in nature. But he is also the poet of exile and separation, whose metaphors of sun and rock make the absurd thickness of the world actually felt. Only as a poet could he reconcile two philosophies of nature which he vainly tried to unify in the discursive prose of The Myth of Sisyphus. The world negates me and at the same time it can placate me. The water of night flows in the stone desert. THE PLACE OF MAN The metaphorist unwittingly exhibits his philosophy in his tropes. An existentialist personifying nature recants his credo in the non-human otherness of the world. Chateaubriand, although avowedly without a faith, was already religious in Rene. Sartre's by-gone accusation that Camus wrote like Chateaubriand was pretty serious in its implications. It insinuated that either Camus was an imitative stylist, a sort of deco- rator, or that he was fooled by his desire for the Romantic myths of Nature. The former charge has been examined; the latter involves the place which Camus' metaphors ascribe to man in the world. To say that about half of Camus' images seem to achieve personi- fication requires qualification. First, animism is inherent in the French language and many verbs of action readily endow phenomena with intentions without making a poetic metaphor: Le soleil se leve. The typical Romantic metaphor, on the contrary, elicits the Universal Soul from each and every bit of landscape: a tree rises like a great thought in the desert of a mind (Chateaubriand): Albert Beguin has shown the debt of this Romantic conception to the Neo-platonic theory of the Animal-Universe (L'Ame Romantique et le reve). Camus' metaphors illustrate only the physical half of it. Even when carried away by emotion and writing in Lamartinian alexandrines, like ... la main fraiche du soir sur ce coeur agite (Noces) he leaves little room for an Oversoul. The "sighing earth" (Noces), the "panting sea" (The Stranger), the "hill's shoulder" (The Plague), the bone of the desert (The Adulteress) are parts of a body wholly body. The stones of Djemilla and Florence shout that the mind is naught. Anthropomorphic metaphors revive the pagan myths. Their steady decrease in number and significance measures Camus' stylistic prog- ress in conveying his sense of the world's inhuman beauty. As he said in Noces, he did not have to convert himself to this religion; but he had to convert his style to its service. Much as in Sea-Marks, 50</page><page sequence="8">MICHEL BENAMOU images of the "squamous sea," of waves that are "packs of white dogs" respect the absence of man and the "silence and anguish of primitive waters" (L'Ete). Even the image of the sea-bed anticipates Saint-John Perse: O bitter bed, worthy of a prince, the crown lies at the bottom of the sea! Such is the kingdom, in which by an act of love man must be naturalized. Had Camus merely acclimatized Chateaubriand or even Giono to Algeria, he would have little of value to say to the modem mind. But the lessons of man's contact with the world's body, meting out both despair and happiness, placate our modern sense of nature's otherness while satisfying our nostalgia for unity. This theme, counterpointed as it is by Romantic variations, holds much that is new. Man is not the measure of the universe. But he has his place in its light. 51</page></plain_text>
