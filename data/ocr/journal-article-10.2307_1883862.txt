The methodological battle between "orthodox" forms of economics and "institutionalist" or other unorthodox forms has been raging now for a good many years without much sign of a peace. The contestants are so deeply absorbed in pressing their own case that perhaps they do not often stop to try and see the issues in the perspective of the history of social thought. The present study is an attempt to appraise the question of the status of "orthodox" economic theory in terms of the history of economic thought since roughly the beginning of the nineteenth century. Taking what may be called the orthodox tradition as its starting point, it will attempt to trace some of the principal elements which have modified it, which have been put forward under the rubric of economic theory in the course of the last century, trying above all to determine their logical relations to the initial orthodox core. In the second part of the study, the attempt will be made to raise explicitly the question of the scope of economic theory in relation to the other social sciences. On the basis of the historical perspective furnished by the first part it will perhaps be possible to see the essential issues and the logical consequences of taking one or other of the alterna- tives open more clearly than has sometimes been the case. 1. The present article is the first part of a single integral study of which the second part is expected to appear in the succeeding issue of this Journal. In judging it the reader is asked to bear in mind that the present installment cannot be regarded as complete and that many of its bearings will not be clear until the second has also been taken into account. 414</page><page sequence="2">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 415 As a preliminary it is necessary to sketch the general logical framework which may be called "orthodox economic theory" in order to have a scheme of analysis in terms of which to approach actual concrete theories. Direct discussion of the status of the other modifying elements will be postponed till the second part of the study. Any such scheme of analysis is necessarily a product of a rather highly sophisticated phase in the development of a science. The earlier phases are almost always concerned directly with the understanding of pressing concrete, tho not necessarily practical, problems which are attacked in whatever way at the time promises results, without bothering very much about the exact logical nature of the procedures involved or the relation of various possible approaches to each other. The social sciences have now, however, reached a stage where such careful logical discrimination has become imperative and is in process of realization. I It is only in retrospect that we can see just what sort of a science the founders of economics were building up. There can, I think, be little doubt as to what is the main trend of development of economic thought. It is that which has rightly been called orthodox and which, whatever its varia- tions at different stages of development, has certain definite elements of continuity throughout. It may be said to be the general tradition which, starting, for "modern " purposes, with Adam Smith, develops through the classical school, whose most important figures were Ricardo and Mill, down to the marginal utility economics and Marshall. The variations, especially in the later phases, between marginal utility the- ories, specific productivity theories, and mathematical equilib- rium theories, are too numerous and complex to be entered into here. Fortunately they may all be regarded as family quarrels, too minor to be of real significance for the purposes of the present study. What are the distinguishing principles of this orthodox economic thought? The question can, I think, best be an- swered with reference to its later rather than its earlier forms,</page><page sequence="3">416 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS since matters of principle come to be thoroly worked out and clearly formulated only after the difficulties and ambi- guities of earlier rough formulations have come to light. Since this essay is concerned with types, of thought it is essential to achieve as clear-cut a formulation of the "ideal type" "orthodox economic theory" as possible.2 The central conception, perhaps, is that the science of economics is concerned primarily with the study of the processes by which individuals, living in society, secure the means for the satisfaction of their individual wants. In the abstract situation selected out of the complex whole of social life for special study by economics, there are, perhaps, three main groups of elements. In the first place there are the wants of the individuals, or groups which may be taken as units for economic purposes, making up the society. While it is logically quite possible to enter into a very complex investigation in order to explain the nature and existence of the wants which in the last analysis motivate acquisitive activities, leading into sociology, psychology, biology and what not, it may be safely said that orthodox economics assumes the wants as given data which the economist at most simplifies into relatively general types. Their explana- tion is left to other sciences. The quantitative measure of want-satisfaction on which most orthodox economists have agreed is utility. Thus it may be laid down as a fundamental proposition that the economic element of action is directed to the maximization of want-satisfaction or utility. Secondly, the means required for want-satisfaction are not given in unlimited quantity, but must be acquired through a complex process: production. The productive process requires the ultimate expenditure and allocation between alternative uses of the economic resources of the community, which fall into the three great categories of natural resources, labor and the ability to save. It is through the various combi- nations of these resources that satisfactions, utilities, are 2. For the present purposes we are concerned with economic theory only in its aspect as a systematic explanatory theory of empirical phe- nomena. Other aspects of the same body of concepts, as for instance as a possible guide to public policy, are beyond the scope of this paper.</page><page sequence="4">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 417 produced; and the production always involves cost, expendi- ture. Finally, economics makes a definite assumption about the type of human behavior involved in the whole process- namely that it is, in limiting type, rational in the limited sense that, given the "end," maximization of utility through acquisition of the largest possible quantity of means to want- satisfaction compatible with the limitations of "cost," the adaptation of means to this end tends to be the best possible under the circumstances.3 The end may thus, in the given circumstances, be held to determine the course of action. This rationality will hold equally of the individual's distri- bution of his income between his different wants, and of the processes by which he acquires his income. While these essential elements will hold for an isolated individual, such a case has no more than an academic inter- est. The fact of a plurality of individuals living together in a society introduces the further complications of the division of labor and exchange. With these conditions and a gen- eral medium of exchange, money, the immediate end of individual economic action becomes predominantly the acquisition of money, and this fact makes a quantitative treatment of economic problems enormously easier. Eco- nomics is, in fact, the only social science which enjoys the advantage of an automatic-quantification of its subject mat- ter. The boon is not unspoiled, however, since the trans- lation of money-quantities into utility terms is not an easy matter. Given the acquisition of means of want-satisfaction as the aim of economic action, there are three logical limiting types of sets of conditions under which the action can take place.4 One, generally called competition, is where each individual 3. For some of the reasons why this must be considered an ideal type and not a concrete description see Knight, Relation of Utility to Economic Method, in Methods of Social Science, S. A. Rice, ed. The present sketch can in the nature of the case be only very rough. Really precise statement would call for much greater elaboration. It will, however, suffice for present purposes. 4. See Pareto, Manuel d'economie politique, Ch. III, Sec. 40ff.</page><page sequence="5">418 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS works to satisfy his own wants under a given set of market and production conditions which he is unable to alter delib- erately. The second, monopoly, is where there is more or less possibility of altering the conditions. The third, collec- tivism, is where the whole society is deliberately organized and centrally controlled for the acquisition of means. His- torically, for important reasons, competition has been much the most-used assumption in developing economic theory. Only relatively recently has much attention been devoted to the theory of the other cases. The existence of a complex system of division of labor and exchange and of a generally recognized medium of exchange creates certain possibilities of complication. The immediate "economic" motive of each individual may become the maxi- mization of his money income. And what is from the point of view of the community as a whole and thus of the indi- viduals in it taken together the "real" end of economic activity, the production of goods and services, becomes from the point of view of each individual a means, and money the immediate end. Thus the economic system as a whole may be looked at from two angles, one as an "earning" process, the other as a "producing" process. The coordination of the two becomes a major issue. Theoretically perfect coordination is possible under certain very rigidly defined sets of conditions - those of the theorem of Maximum Satisfaction which is generally formulated subject to existing distribution of ownership. Perhaps the most important of these is that "purchasing power" should be power only over goods and services for consumption, not power over persons which is by its inherent nature cumulative. The line is a very difficult one to draw in concrete reality. In general the lack of coordination will be empirically as important as the extent of its existence. Furthermore the very fact of the division of labor intro- duces a further complication. In the theory of competitive individualism every case of cooperation for a common end is in so far an element of monopoly, a disturbing factor. It is, except for the extent to which the family, not the indi-</page><page sequence="6">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 419 vidual, is the real unit of consumption, possible to eliminate this factor very largely on the "earning" side. But on the "producing" side organization may well be a fact of dom- inant importance. This was not true, of course, of the earlier formulations of the theory, which thought of exchange as the only "social" process while production was individual and solitary. But the facts of a changing society have forced a reconsideration in terms of a productive unit which itself is a complex organization of cooperating individuals. The polar antithesis of Locke's solitary Indian killing a deer is the modern giant corporation. It is quite possible that a whole series of such organization types of the unit of economic enterprise might each be taken as a basic assumption for purposes of theoretical reasoning. Marx, following up sug- gestions in Malthus and Ricardo, was perhaps the first to attempt to build a theoretical structure on the assumption of an organized producing unit. The theories developed on this basis may, in certain ways, serve not merely as explanatory principles, but as norms of economic efficiency. Since the type-case which economic theory makes use of is that of the norm of rationality in the adaptation of means, under given conditions, to given ends, thought of in practical terms, the theory expresses the best possible utilization of the given resources to satisfy the given wants. This aspect of the theory has, for the case of competition, been formulated particularly in terms of the Doctrine of Maximum Satisfaction, which, under the assump- tions of rationality, independence of wants from the processes of their satisfaction, and mobility of resources, states that the pursuit by each individual of his own interests in com- petitive production will result in the maximum of want- satisfaction for all the individuals in the society. The leading elements studied by orthodox economics thus formulated form an abstract "ideal type." On this basis a theory has partly been developed, partly awaits elaboration, which by itself says nothing as to the concrete relevance of the assumptions on which it is based. The problems of the relation of economics and the other social sciences and the</page><page sequence="7">420 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS various possible concepts of the scope of economics arise out of investigation into the concrete significance of these assumptions and the relation of the factors specifically dealt with in this theory to the others which may be held to play a part in social life and which may or may not be dealt with by other sciences. II We shall make use of a double classification of the possible ways in which this "ideal type" of economic theory may be related to the concrete reality. The first distinction involves the general conception of science entertained by the writers concerned. On the one hand they may adopt an "empiricist" view, that any science, or at least economics, has the task of delivering a full and complete explanatory account of a given sector of concrete reality. In terms of this attitude two basic alternatives are possible: Either the principles of eco- nomic theory as above outlined are directly, without essential qualification for other factors, applicable to concrete "eco- nomic activities," to "business," in which case the orthodox theory will be held to be satisfactory by itself, or they are not so applicable. In this latter case, two further alternatives are open - they must be supplemented by other elements, still dealt with within the framework of economic science, or, in the more radical view, they are definitely wrong and economics must build anew from the start. If any departure from the "narrow orthodoxy" sketched above be held to be a "sociological element"' then the earlier theories introduc- ing such elements have employed mainly the supplementary method; a root and branch criticism of the whole thing and a tendency to throw it all out is relatively recent. The great bulk of "unorthodox" movements have belonged in this general "empiricist" category. On the other hand, one may take a view of a science that its specific subject matter is not concrete phenomena as such, but a logically defined abstract element or set of elements in 5. Whether this view is justified will be discussed in the second part of the study, to appear in the next issue of this Journal.</page><page sequence="8">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 421 the concrete. If this position be adopted, criticism of the direct concrete applicability of economic principles ceases to be so disturbing. Divergences may be explained as due to other factors - and the corrective is no longer necessarily alone the remodeling of economic theory to take account of them but rather the synthesis of its results with those of other sciences in the final full explanation of the concrete. The latter is a path explicitly and consciously taken only in rela- tively recent times - some outstanding examples of it will be discussed in the second part of the study. Its path con- sists not so much in emphasizing sociological or other ele- ments within economics, as in working out a sociological supplement to an avowedly abstract economics. In certain respects this has formed one of the most important trends of recent sociological thought which, to a very important de- gree, has been determined by this means of defining its rela- tion to economics.6 The other main line of distinction of theories will concern the character of the elements invoked to supplement or replace, as the case may be, the central element of rational economic action. This, like all "action" (as distinct from " behavior " in the technical Behaviorist sense), is and must be analyzed in terms of some form of the schema of the relation of means and ends. The peculiarity of "economic" action is its situation in an intermediate position in the great chain of means and ends, where its "ends" are by definition only means to other ends of a more ultimate nature. The ultimate ends motivating the action, as well as the main facts of the situation, the "conditions" of the action, are taken for granted as data. Looking at the thing, as this schema does, from the "subjective" point of view, i.e. that of the indi- vidual acting, the supplementing of the "economic" element can take place in two directions. One or other or both of these sets of data can be turned into problems and their explanation made an obligation of the economic theorist. 6. The present part of the study will be concerned with theories on the empiricist basis. The second part will take up the alternative of an abstract economic theory in relation to other abstract social sciences.</page><page sequence="9">422 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Historically, in the tradition of Anglo-Saxon economics, by far the greater part of the unorthodox movements have con- centrated their attention on the "conditions," rather than the "ends." In this manner attention is thrown to such factors as the external environment, the ultimate source of natural resources, population and the laws of its growth, scientific knowledge and its resultant technology, or finally the "social environment"7 consisting above all of forms of business organization. Since the bulk of these thinkers are empiricists in the above sense their treatment must also be accompanied by some positive means of eliminating the ele- ment of ends from consideration. For this purpose various psychological assumptions like hedonism, the instinct of acquisition or other constant instincts or, finally, an "habit- ual " standard of living have proved most serviceable. Marshall was, to my knowledge, the first English economist explicitly to make "wants" a variable category, an inno- vation the implications of which certainly led farther than he realized. From the formal point of view of the logical structure of scientific theory, the empirical "supplement" to abstract economics consists merely in narrowing the range of the "data" accepted without inquiry by economics, and a cor- responding widening of the range of "problems" included within its scope. Given, as any empiricism of the above type must assume, the constancy (for scientific purposes at least) of the ultimate ends of action, it is inevitable that there should be a general tendency to measure means in terms of the degree to which they realize these ultimate ends. Hence a continual bias toward a linear evolutionary view of the process of "eco- nomic" development, laying stress, as the case may be, on biological selection, accumulation of scientific knowledge and resulting technological improvement, or better adaptation of social organization, i.e. its becoming more "economic." To account for a long period of time in achieving a relatively 7. The methodological status of this element raises important prob- lems. They will be discussed in the second part of the study.</page><page sequence="10">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 423 high degree of such adaptation it is convenient to invoke retarding influences, so that the process may be conceived as one of emancipation from them. " Ignorance " and " custom " are by far the most pervasive of these, tho others such as Veblen's "anthropomorphism" and "predation" may also enter. But in the face of this logical situation it is natural to sus- pect that the appearance of qualitative rather than quanti- tative differences between economic epochs and systems indi- cates the presence of elements of a different sort, even if they are arrayed in a single irreversible temporal order. There is one great body of economic "empiricism" in which this insist- ence on qualitative differences is most conspicuous: the Ger- man Historical School. It is in fact the antithesis to the Anglo-Saxon "positivistic" empiricism. It either assumes as constant, or tends to ignore or minimize, such factors as external environment, even science and technology, as well as man's bio-psychological equipment. The emphasis on the other hand is on the specific totality of a " culture " and above all on the integration of its economic organization and activ- ities with its religious and ethical values, or more vaguely its "Geist " or spirit. The difference made by the abstract as opposed to the empirical view of economic science is that the "ends" and "conditions" of action, instead of modifying or replacing the "economic " element, are held to supplement it in a wider synthetic view. On the one hand economics is held to be abstract because it neglects the "conditions" of economic action, on the other because it neglects the specific nature of its ultimate ends. Finally, criticism may attack the economic conception of the process of economic action itself. This attack has from the positivistic side centered above all on the rational ele- ment. In its extreme form positivistic anti-intellectualism has held the rational element in any action to be either non- existent or negligible. To find a substitute for the logical r6le of rational action the positivist is driven in the first instance to some form of anti-intellectualist psychology, usually in</page><page sequence="11">424 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS instinct or behaviorist form, and ultimately to a biological explanation of this in turn. This path has above all been taken by the school of empiricists who have argued first that all economics is dependent on psychological assumptions; second, that the older economics was eventually an applica- tion of hedonistic psychology; and third, that modern psy- chology has disposed of hedonism. The " historical " opposition on the other hand has attacked not so much the conception of rational action itself in its broader sense but rather its specific economic form as domi- nated by "calculation of advantage." As against this it has urged the individual's incorporation in the larger groups and his subordination to superindividual ends. The theories to be taken up explicitly in the remainder of this study will be chosen with a view not to encyclopedic completeness, but rather to illustrate each of the principal logical possibilities inherent in the situation just sketched. Omission of particular names does not indicate an adverse judgment on the thinker "slighted" but rather limitations, on the one hand of space, on the other of the writer's interest in and knowledge of particular theories. Obviously a com- plete discussion would require an extended treatise rather than a moderate essay. III The simplest position of course is that which takes the ideal type of "economic" action and relationships and maintains its direct and unqualified applicability to concrete " economic" phenomena. This position may be called "empirical ortho- doxy" as opposed to the "abstract orthodoxy" of Pareto for instance.8 It involves one of two assumptions. The less radical is that there is a concrete "sphere" of activities, a "department" of social life in which these abstractly defined relationships are substantially true in concrete fact. The more radical is the generalization of this view to include not merely the one "department" but virtually (or in limiting type, absolutely) all of social life. This latter makes economic 8. See second article for an explicit discussion.</page><page sequence="12">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 425 theory the central element in, if not the whole of, a system of general social theory; in perhaps the strictest sense of the expression it is the "economic interpretation of history." In fact such a view, wavering as between the less and the more radical of the above assumptions, has played a very great part in the history of economic thought. In general the tendency has been to concentrate on the analysis of a limited sector of concrete relationships - those roughly of market value, price and the distribution of wealth - with a certain indefiniteness as to how far it was legitimate to push the analysis out into the peripheral questions of factors impinging upon but not so directly involved in these relationships. This is substantially true of that element of the utilitarian tradition which, following Locke and Adam Smith, rested on some form of the postulate of the "natural identity of interest."9 It is at least one main strain in the " classical " economics and the later thought of Jevons and Marshall. Historically the theory was arrived at mainly by consider- ing how the harmony of a beneficent state of nature could be translated into the conditions of a society characterized by the division of labor and exchange. The fundamental concept is that of the quantitative equivalence of exchange relations so that it can still be said that in a "virtual" sense every individual receives in exchange only the product of his own labor. The absence, on the one hand, of the concept of mar- ginal utility and hence the emphasis on a "real" cost of pro- duction theory of value, the derivation, on the other, from the conception of a nonsocial state of nature, where the produc- tive functions of land, capital and business management are not in evidence, led to the main peculiarities of the classical system centering about the r6le of labor in production and value. The internal logical difficulties growing out of this situation can be said to have been substantially overcome in the later marginal utility and opportunity cost theory, so that the theory of a competitive economic order expressed 9. Cf. E. Halevy, La formation du radicalisme philosophique, 3 vols. This is incomparably the most extensive and penetrating analysis of the interrelated currents of English social and economic "individualism" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="13">426 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS in the propositions involved in the modern Doctrine of Maxi- mum Satisfaction constitutes the most sophisticated and logically satisfactory formulation of economic theory in this sense. In so far as this theory has been held to be substan- tially true of any considerable section of concrete reality "orthodox empiricism" has existed. Analysis of the logical conditions necessary for the formu- lation of such a theoretical system, however, soon reveals the necessity for the existence of a very definite set of correspond- ing concrete conditions for the working of the real system. If then the theoretical analysis is to apply directly to the con- crete reality these conditions must be proved to exist and be accounted for. This above all involves the factual conformity of the competitive process to rules which prevent its diver- gence from the assumed end. It is not difficult to show that the use of either physical violence or deception as means of attaining "economic" ends, on the one hand, or of economic resources and strategic position in economic relations as instruments of power over others, on the other, will upset the conditions for the working of such a system. How then is their absence accounted for? The simplest and least convincing solution is simply to assume that they are in some sense contrary to the nature of things, or a variant of the same view, that the enlightenment of self-interest will cause each individual to see that his own interest is so bound up with that of the system as a whole that it does not "pay" to do anything detrimental to the latter. Among other things this would involve the assump- tion that the length of time entering into the calculations of one's own "long-run" interests so far transcended the span of a single human life as to become essentially meaningless. It is difficult to see how acts the benefit of which will accrue to posterity of only the fourth or fifth generation can be construed as motivated by self-interest. The general social theory underlying this view is of course anarchism and strictly speaking the theory of a system of "pure" economic individualism operating without control by any other agency is a form of anarchism.</page><page sequence="14">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 427 But relatively few economists have been so "tender- minded" as to believe seriously in its possibility. On the "periphery" has almost always been found a noneconomic controlling agency. The most pervasive of course has been the state whose "minimum" functions -external defense, maintenance of internal order and enforcement of contracts (now almost all economists would add provision of a monetary standard) - have very generally been held to be necessary. In general the "laissez-faire" economists' objection has not been to the state having anything to do with the economic system, but to its doing the wrong things. This view of the necessity of the state may be said to be common ground for all economists except the extreme anarchistic wing. In addition to this, various other regulatory mechanisms have made their appearance from time to time. Besides those to be discussed specifically later, two may be mentioned here: Adam Smith's "moral sentiment," and that vague but none the less important factor invoked by Ricardo to fill in some of the gaps left open by his economic analysis, the "habits and customs of the people."' By and large tho, while such factors as this have served to fill the chinks along the outside walls of economic science, they have not been made the subject of systematic analysis, as distinct from more or less casual citation, by economists themselves, and above all have not been built into the body of economic theory - Adam Smith's "moral sentiments," for instance, were dealt with in a separate work and not as part of the Wealth of Nations. The first major change in this situation which deeply shook the optimistic laissez-faire individualism of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries came in with the doctrines of Malthus, which gave new turns to thought in at least three different directions. The "pure type" of economic theory is after all pretty narrowly defined -it may be compared to the crest of a narrow knife-like ridge. Once having made a step off it on either side it is by no means easy to stop, for the empiricist, at least. And it is all the more difficult to avoid making such 1. Cf. Principles of Political Economy, Everyman edition, p. 55.</page><page sequence="15">428 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS a step to one side when one is primarily preoccupied with avoiding a step down the other. This in essence is what hap- pened to Malthus. He fully realized the indistinctness of the boundary between the laissez-faire doctrines of his time and anarchism. The latter in the form of Mr. Godwin's Political Justice he was above all concerned to combat. But to exor- cise an evil spirit it is sometimes necessary to call in the devil himself. Malthus in fact slipped over heavily down the op- posite slope into three main lines of thought, all of dubiously ''economic" parentage. The devil in this case was, of course, the "principle of population," in essence the view that the main lines of our social situation are determined by the (nearly) uncontrol- lable propensities of "human nature" on the one hand, the unalterable niggardliness of an unkind physical nature in the form of Diminishing Returns on the other. This is the first major beginning of the linking of economics with biological theories of survival, a trend which will be entered into more at length below. But this devil also has offspring who are not to be ignored. As Malthus says to Godwin, imagining his anarchistic idyl once realized, the growth of population would soon lead, as the only alternative to chaos and general starvation, to the spontaneous reestablishment of the institutions of property and marriage and the division of society into classes of employers and laborers. The first two items form perhaps the first appearance in economic thought of an independent role of social institutions as regulators of economic life - in this case with specific reference to the growth of population. As distinct from the more usual position these institutions are not for Malthus "instituted" by the state, but arise spontaneously in the processes of social life itself. The state merely sanctions them. This independence is the new note. It is true that Malthus shared the view of his contemporaries that the pursuit by each individual of his own self-interest was beneficial to the whole - in fact it was the vis medicatrix rei publtcae, the very life principle. Ill-advised interference with it, as in Pitt's</page><page sequence="16">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 429 Poor Law, could only have disastrous consequences. But this was true only within the framework of institutional control. Without such control it is quite safe to assume that for Malthus, as for Hobbes, self-interest could only lead to social chaos, a bellum omnium contra omnes. But the further development of the independent role of institutions as a regulator of economic activities belongs to a much later date in the history of social theories. The thing of by far the most important immediate influence was the third consequence of the principle of population, the division of society into classes. The original starting point of individu- alistic economics, the conception of a state of nature, had no place for a division into classes. All men were by nature equal. And this natural equality was carried over into the division of labor as necessary to preserve equivalence in exchange. The only differences were those due to the greater "quantity of labor" performed by one man as compared with another. The typical division of labor thought of was where each man produced and exchanged the products of his own labor, the deer and beaver of Adam Smith's and Ricardo's examples.2 But for Malthus the pressure of population drove the division of labor farther, to the splitting up of processes within the same productive unit and a division between those supervising and those carrying out the process. Malthus was so concerned with the greater productivity of this more minute division of labor as a means of supporting population that he did not draw the crucial theoretical conse- quences of the fact that the division into classes meant an inherent and cumulative inequality between the classes, both as to wealth and, more important, as to economic power. The basis of this inequality had been clearly seen by Adam Smith in his analysis of the conditions of the labor contract,3 but not used for theoretical purposes. Ricardo went a step farther in his statements about the precariousness of the standard of living and the greater likelihood of its being lowered than 2. Wealth of Nations, p. 41; Principles of Political Economy, pp. 6, 15, 16. 3. Wealth of Nations, p. 58.</page><page sequence="17">430 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS raised.4 But for Ricardo the "capitalist" was primarily the one who supported laborers, and who took the residual share of the income. So in spite of the clear-cut conflict of the inter- ests of the classes in his theory of distribution the differences of power with their implications for the stability of the com- petitive system were not prominent in his thought. It was Marx who took the decisive step in this direction. Assuming the organized capitalistic enterprise as the unit of his system, he laid the principal stress on its control by the owner- manager, particularly through his ownership, and the result- ant cumulative process of "exploitation" of labor leading finally to the overturn of the whole structure.5 Thus the introduction of this power element within the economic sys- tem and its crystallization, by virtue of the advanced division of labor and the resulting structure of the organized pro- ductive unit, about the division into classes, led to a basic reconstruction of economic theory itself. A very great amount of subsequent economic discussion, particularly "unortho- dox" theories of the business cycle, goes back ultimately to differences over this point.6 Whether the power element and the class difference are or are not "economic " factors cannot be said to be agreed today. What is popularly called the "economic interpretation of history," being of Marxian origin, naturally includes them. It can be said to shade off into the narrower version referred to above by imperceptible degrees. A great deal of mis- understanding in discussion would be avoided if people would make their position on this point clear in their argu- ments. The introduction of the power element through Mal- thus led to an internal reorganization of economic theory. We have now to note two movements which while leaving 4. Principles of Political Economy, p. 75. 5. Part of the Marxian theory of "exploitation" is based on the erroneous classical view of the r6le of labor in production referred to above. But even in the more correct modern formulations the intro- duction of cumulative differences of power will lead to substantially similar results, tho differing somewhat in detail. 6. Outside Marxist circles, cf. Hobson.</page><page sequence="18">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 431 the theory intact (in either of the above versions) have attempted to give it a more secure underpinning and a more certain and extensive concrete application by supplementing it with certain theories not inherently logically implied in it, nor involved in its internal structure. The first movement is psychological hedonism. Finding its most famous and influential formulation in Bentham's "felicific calculus" it became so intimately associated with the classical economics in the system of "philosophical radicalism" that some later critics have (erroneously) held them to be logically in- separable. Hedonism accepts the rationality of the processes of action. What it does is to put in the place of the diversity of wants, assumed as data by the economist,7 one all-pervading psy- chological motive, the pursuit of pleasure. This gives an appearance of completeness of explanation of the totality of action, which cannot but be of great comfort to the empiricist with his inability to rest content with abstractions. Since there seems to be one direction of economic activity - acqui- sition - and this is thought of in quantitative terms, it is logically very satisfactory to have one quantitatively vari- able motive explaining it all. It is only natural that the wide currency of hedonistic psychology as an integral part of the "philosophical radi- calism" of the earlier nineteenth century should have greatly aided in giving generality and philosophical sanction to the classical economics, especially in the then prevailing empiricist atmosphere. Even later in the new impetus given by Jevons by his discovery of the principle of marginal utility the con- nection remained very close indeed, perhaps closer than it has ever been. It is true that in an empiricist view economics must have a psychological foundation, and that hedonism is the one by far best adapted to the rational-individualistic economics. But the advance of an abstract factor view of the scope of 7. Or perhaps somewhat better stated, in place of the generalized immediate "economic" goal of action, the acquisition of "purchasing power," the quite different psychological motive, pleasure.</page><page sequence="19">432 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS economics has made it possible to separate it from hedonism. This is possible because it is no longer necessary to postulate that "economic motives" are ultimate motives in any sense, but that acquisitiveness, in the sense of a tendency to maxi- mize utilities, is a simple deduction from the general postulate of rationality of economic action. The possibility of quanti- tative treatment of utility arises not from the fact that it reflects a single ultimate motive, but that, remaining on the level of means, its immediate object is generalized purchasing power, that is command over the means to the satisfaction of all wants whatever their ultimate nature. It is merely a truism that the "satisfaction" of wants is greater the greater the means available for their satisfaction. It is further worth while to point out that the confusion over the relation of economics to psychology in general and hedonism in particular has been greatly increased by the very prevalent identification of all elements of behavior seen from the "subjective" point of view, i.e. that of the acting indi- vidual, with "psychological" elements. Since the latter category refers to one factor in concrete behavior, the former to the whole of behavior seen from one aspect, they can be the same only if there is only the one factor. The economic category of utility is certainly a "subjective" category - outside the "subjective" means-end relation economics in the factor sense has no meaning whatever, but it does not follow that it is a psychological concept at all. Finally from a strictly empiricist point of view hedonism itself scarcely constitutes a sufficient basis for economics. It leaves unanswered the question why pleasure has come to be associated with certain forms of activity and not with others. The pursuit of such questions inevitably leads far beyond the mere hedonistic postulate itself into questions like that of biological survival, which will form the subject of our next treatment. We have already seen that Malthus was one of the first to invoke biological considerations in the explanation of the "economic" facts confronting him. In fact the Mal- thusian theory and, more generally, the whole classical eco-</page><page sequence="20">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 433 nomics form a main element in the background of one of the greatest intellectual movements of modern times: Darwinism. In practically all thought concerned with man in the second as distinct from the first half of the nineteenth century and having any kind of a positivistic leaning, it has had a major r6le. On the one hand Malthus' conception of the vast potential fecundity of man, generalized to include all organic species, provided the surplus on which natural selection could oper- ate - on the other the theory of economic competition as a means of promoting efficiency provided a model for the con- ception of the process itself. In fact so striking was the analogy that Keynes has remarked, "The Principle of Sur- vival of the Fittest could be regarded as one vast generaliza- tion of the Ricardian Economics."8 To be sure there are difficulties in the analogy with the organic structure. As Malthus so clearly recognized, competition to be beneficent must proceed according to rules of the game which in the con- ception of "Nature red in tooth and claw" were conspicuous only by their absence. Moreover to retain a direct connec- tion with the older economics it was necessary to leave a place for a limited r6le of rationality of individual action. However, while Darwinism may be considered both the mother and the goal of practically the whole of the positivistic phase of the modern anti-intellectualist movement, it is only relatively recently that it has penetrated economic thought in this radical form - on that we shall remark briefly below. Its first effect was undoubtedly to bolster up the classical view of the economic process by tending to widen it out into one of cosmic significance. The earlier phase was perhaps best represented by what was hardly explicitly an economic theory at all - the indi- vidualism of Spencer. On the one hand his extreme negative position on the outside control of this competitive process came so close to anarchism that the necessity of controlling rules for the economic as distinct from the biological struggle scarcely even occurred to him. On the other the Lamarckian 8. The End of Laissez-faire, New Republic edition, p. 17a</page><page sequence="21">434 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS element in his biology made it easier to maintain the postu- late of economic rationality than strict Darwinism would have done. But perhaps the most notable attempt by an economist to relate the conception of an individualistic competitive order to the general conditions of biological survival in Darwinian terms has been that of Professor T. N. Carver.9 Starting from the economic doctrine of Maximum Satisfaction and its implication that an individualistic competitive order is the most efficient possible, he has maintained that for this reason its adoption constitutes the most powerful factor in the chances of survival of a group. It thus becomes, as for Spencer, the logical end of the great process of social evolu- tion which in turn is the continuation of biological evolution. It is, however, interesting to note that Professor Carver somewhat modifies the "pure" conception of "economic" society, partly to bring it successfully into this wider frame- work. It is for his purposes no longer adequate to consider the "end" of social organization as merely the maximization of individual want-satisfaction. It is necessary to show that a competitive order contributes more than any other to "sur- vival value." As a means of maximizing the economic power of such a society, and of guaranteeing against its resting on its oars in the ultimate struggle for survival, he invokes the "work-bench philosophy," the devotion to work for its own sake - a motive entirely outside the logical necessities of the older system. Also he goes rather farther than some of his predecessors in conceding that the correct rules of the game need to be laid down by an agency outside the competitive process itself, notably as regards the unearned increment from land, monopoly, and inheritance of property. In many ways Professor Carver's theories are directly reminiscent of those of Herbert Spencer, who has the same combination of orthodox economic individualism and biological evolutionism. But being free from Spencer's naive Lamarckian biology, 9. See especially "Essays in Social Justice," "The Religion Worth Having," and his recently published "Essential Factors of Social Evolution."</page><page sequence="22">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 435 and considerably more clear headed in meeting objections to unmitigated laissez faire, it serves as a better example of this type of theory. IV The "unorthodox" elements entering into economics in the theories so far discussed have consisted in modifications in and supplements to the "orthodox" theories due to the addition of factors not considered by the latter. Still remain- ing on positivistic ground there is another class of theories which go farther - they do not merely add to the orthodox theory, they reject it as positively wrong and substitute other positivistic elements in its place as explanations of the concrete facts of economic life. (a) As pointed out before, the "ideal type" of economic action concerns a relatively narrow sector in the whole long chain of relations between ultimate ends and "ultimate means." Without attacking the validity of the basic scheme of means-end relationships it is possible to object to the emphasis on the specifically "economic" element in it, and bring out others instead. This is essentially the position taken by Veblen. The general framework of his theoretical structure is essen- tially very simple. In the typical fashion of positivistic empiricism he disposes of the problem of the role of ultimate ends by assuming them to be given as constant factors in the form of four basic "instincts": the "parental bent,"" "preda- tory bent," the "bent of workmanship" and "idle curiosity." Unlike the instincts of the main type of anti-intellectualist psychology, however, Veblen's are explicitly "teleological"; they are "ends" of action rather than "tendencies." The processes of their expression or attainment, on the other hand, he thinks of as rational, resting on a knowledge of the condi- tions under which action takes place.1 Secondly, Veblen criticizes the orthodox economics as logically dependent on hedonistic psychology. Since he holds 1. Cf. The Instinct of Workmanship, Ch. I.</page><page sequence="23">436 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the latter to be positively unsound2 and fails to make the separation just discussed,3 he is forced to throw out the type of "economic action" altogether. One may say that in so doing he throws out the "baby with the bath." He is then left with two main types of rational action in fulfillment of the instincts, each resting on a type of knowledge and of interest. On the one hand there is the "predatory" type, concerned with the promotion of egoistic interests and resting on prag- matic "worldly wisdom," a knowledge of men, their weak- nesses, susceptibilities, etc., that is everything about them which may be turned to the advantage of the agent dealing with them when he tries to use them as means to his own ends. This in turn is subdivided into the explicitly "preda- tory" type, making use of violence and outright fraud to attain its ends, and the peaceful "pecuniary" type making strategic use of economic power, especially as given in mo- nopoly position and the command over large masses of property, to attain ends always at the expense of others. On the other hand there is the "workmanlike" type of action, resting on knowledge of "opaque fact" and "mechan- ical sequences," such knowledge being essentially the product of "idle curiosity." The interest in this case is in the work- manship itself, in the best possible performances of the tech- nical task on hand, with a rather vague (and untenable) implication that such devotion to workmanship works out to promote the general welfare while "pragmatic" action in terms of self-interest is always essentially predatory. This being the case Veblen sees the main line of continuity in the process of social development as that of workmanship or essentially industrial technology. The pragmatic type does not figure as an "evolutionary" factor because it is, on the one hand, destructive-it is the Hobbesian element; on the other hand there is no such cumulative development of 'worldly wisdom" as there is of "matter of fact knowledge." There have been three eras relatively favorable to work- 2. "Preconceptions of Economic Science" in The Place of Science in Modern Civilization. 3. Sect. III.</page><page sequence="24">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 437 manship': the "savage" era of peaceful industry, held back, however, by the "self-contamination" of workmanship - its tendency to turn to magical manipulations, the era of handicraft when peace was established but pecuniary inter- ests were not yet predominant, and finally the modern era of the "machine process." The modern economic situation Veblen interprets mainly in terms of the inharmonious rela- tions, on the one hand, of the "machine process" and the "industrial employments" that go with it, on the other, of the essentially predatory and self-inhibiting strategic maneu- vers of the business men in their "pecuniary employments."4 Veblen's whole treatment of the latter centers around an emphasis on the power factor which brings him in this respect close to Marx. Also in a rather vague way he conceives of the working classes as concerned with workmanship as against pecuniary strategy (a conception a little hard to reconcile with certain phases of trade union activity) and hence tends to identify his division with the Marxian class division. In his conception, however, the working class is a passive factor in the struggle for power in a way quite foreign to Marx. Veblen's struggle is essentially between business men. More- over, for Marx the machine technology is mainly significant as influencing the structure of the business unit and setting the stage for the particular modern class conflict, while for Veblen it is itself the central and the only forward-movzng as against inhthing element in the economic process. Veblen's principal catchword for use against the older economics is "institutions." Nowhere to my knowledge does he clearly define the concept, usually employing such vague expressions as "habits" and "modes of activity." Where does it fit into his general theoretical scheme? There is one almost universal connotation of the term "institutions" which certainly also applies to Veblen- a certain relativity. Institutions are not one of the elements which may be held to remain constant at all times and places. One of Veblen's main indictments against the orthodox eco- nomics was that it was a "taxonomic" science, interested 4. Theory of Business Enterprise, Ch. 1.</page><page sequence="25">438 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS mainly in classification. For our purposes this may be taken to mean that it thinks in terms of a few fundamental and unchanging categories - value, cost, production, distribu- tion, etc. As against this Veblen sets the ideal of an "evolu- tionary" science, one which explains things genetically in terms of temporal antecedents with the implication of an irreversible process of change in time. It is mainly as this changing, "evolutionary" element in economic life that Veblen thinks of institutions. Given his general theory, the constancy of the four instincts excludes the possibility of this element being attributed mainly to the varying ends of action;5 it must have to do with the processes of attaining ends themselves. The doc- trine then seems to be that these processes are not settled ad hoc in each case by new rational considerations, but that they get crystallized into relatively well established and settled modes of doing things and of thinking about them. Variations take the form of alterations, in each case relatively slight, of these settled modes, due to new exigencies of the situation or the inherent process of advancing matter-of- fact knowledge - a truly Darwinian conception. While continually changing there is in every society at every stage a relatively stable pattern of such institutions, which forms the main basis of its specific structure. Since there are for Veblen two principal categories of action - the workmanlike and the pragmatic - there are cor- respondingly two main groups of institutions, regulating these two respectively. But since society is one, they have to stand in some sort of relation to each other. In general they will tend to harmonize, but, especially in the later stages of social evolution, since the most important dynamic factor is the technological process, the institutions directly associated with it tend to change more rapidly and those of the " prag- matic" type tend to lag behind and to represent a set of habits formed in connection with an earlier technological stage. This will be the more true the farther removed the persons 5. Such variability is brought in on various occasions by talking of the temporary "predominance" of one or the other instinct.</page><page sequence="26">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 439 and groups concerned are from direct contact with the every- day technological processes.6 Thus, in addition to his complete rejection of the concept of "economic action" in the strict sense and his consequent concentration of attention on predation and technology, Veblen has invoked a further element - "institutions." Tho never very explicitly stated it is to be inferred that its impor- tance goes back mainly to a psychological thesis - that of the very great importance of "habit" in concrete action. Thus Veblen's theory of institutions is the expression mainly of one element of psychological anti-intellectualism, tho it is confined to the retarding, lag element, while social change is essentially due to rational adaptation. This psychological element, and the fact that, having assumed ultimate ends as constant, institutions concern only the processes of action, marks Veblen's "institutional" theory off sharply from others to be discussed later.' As opposed to them it may be called "positivistic institutionalism." Thus, in Veblen, empiricism has borne the curious fruit that the science of economics has become a complete philosophy of history emphasizing everything in human life, ultimate ends- to be sure in terms of a very special theory of them - preda- tion, technology, science, even institutions accounted for by habit, leaving out only the specifically economic element. It is carrying the revolt against the orthodox economics about as far as it can be done - by throwing out its own positive conceptions root and branch - and putting in its place almost every other conceivable element. Surely the sin of commit- ting the fallacy of "misplaced concreteness" on the part of the older economists has been amply avenged. (b) In Veblen's theory of institutions the psychological 6. This is the essential theoretical argument of Veblen's celebrated Theory of the Leisure Class. In our society the leisure class and its institutions form one great "archaic" survival of the "predatory cul- ture." The most recent variant of the general theory is the "culture lag" theory of Professor Ogburn. The resemblance is so striking that it almost certainly owes much to Veblen. See Ogburn, Social Change. 7. In the second part of the study.</page><page sequence="27">440 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS factor of habit has made its appearance in economic thought. It is an element of psychological anti-intellectualism whose derivation from Darwinism is very evident. One further step in this general direction is possible. Veblen, after all, repudi- ated only the specifically economic form of rational action, retaining the predatory and the technological. One may go a step farther and repudiate the r6le of rationality altogether. This step has not been made the basis of any really well worked-out "economic theory," in fact has hardly gone beyond methodological discussions and scattered, unsys- tematized appeals to certain nonrational psychological factors to explain certain concrete phenomena -such as " crowd psychology" as a factor in bank runs, etc. Neverthe- less two anti-intellectual psychological movements have had enough influence to merit at least mention. The one most closely related to the Veblenian point of view and most in vogue among his followers is behaviorism. Their principal conception for the interpretation of behavior, the " conditioned reflex, " is a more precise and physiological formulation of what Veblen more vaguely had called "habit." With the extension of the reflex mechanism to cover the areas of rationality still allowed by Veblen, the "institutional " element in his theory easily passes over into a generally behavioristic social theory. In addition, Veblen's conception of science as "matter of fact" knowledge of "opaque fact" and its distinction from the " worldly wisdom " of insight into human motives fits into the behavioristic stress on "objec- tivity" and its abhorrence of contact with the "subjective." Finally the common filiation from Darwinism is very clear indeed. The conditioning of behavioristic reflexes is clearly the application of the idea of natural selection to the acts of the individual, while the random movements are the analogue of Darwinian variations. Given the empiricist starting point, it was out of the question that economic thought should have remained immune from the great current of positivistic "objectivism," of which radical behaviorism is the logical culmination. In going over to behaviorism economics approaches the</page><page sequence="28">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 441 final term in departure from its " classical " starting point. Not only has it, as with Veblen, thrown out the particular central category of rational economic action on the grounds of its alleged dependence on a particular unsound psycho- logical theory, but it has on psychological grounds thrown out the whole great category of rational action in general, thus shutting out radically any possibility of a return to the older ways even in a modified form. The other main psychological movement to come under consideration is the "instinct" psychology. In reality it was a twin brother of behaviorism, differing from the latter essen- tially in the emphasis on heredity as against environment. The most notable case in economic literature, perhaps, is Professor Mitchell's pledge of allegiance to MacDougall.8 Arguing, more radically than Veblen, that the assumption of rationality itself and not merely hedonism was the core of the difficulty of the classical theories, he proposed the adoption of MacDougall's scheme of instincts in its stead. He never, to my knowledge, attempted to build a scheme of economic theory on this basis. The insecurity of the whole thing is evident both from the transitoriness of the psychological theories on which Professor Mitchell and other economists have rested their hopes and from the inability to distinguish even a real psychological theory from others. Professor Mitchell's inclusion in a later article of Sombart, along with MacDougall and Thorndike, as a man attempting to supply a psychological foundation to economics shows nothing less than a complete misunderstanding of Sombart's work as the following discussion will show.9 In general, the extension of positivistic empiricism in economics to such extremes of logical conclusion as these psychological theories seems to have involved the science in far more difficulties than it has extricated it from. 8. W. C. Mitchell, Rationality of Economic Action, Quarterly Jour- nal of Economics, 1911. 9. Section V, c.</page><page sequence="29">442 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS V Thus far we have been concerned with theories which in their supplements to or substitute for orthodox economic theory have remained on "positivistic" ground. That is, they have, on the whole, tended either to ignore the problem of ultimate ends or, like Veblen, to assume them constant. They have invoked, on the other hand, such factors as the external "conditions" of action, technology or biological or psychological properties of the human individual. There is another group of theories which, while still remaining on an empiricist basis, trying to explain the whole of concrete "economic" reality, have invoked a quite different order of considerations centering mainly in the r6le of ultimate ends and values in human action, and concentrating their critique of orthodoxy mainly on the predominant concrete r6le it assigns to "economic motives." As a whole, this group may be termed the theories of "romantic empiricism." (a) While the main home of these views has been Germany, strange as it may seem Marshall also may be placed in this category. Of course, Marshall is generally regarded as the very ideal type of orthodoxy. Examination of his theory, however, shows that besides the element of "utility theory" there is in his work a second most important theoretical strand.' It is noteworthy, in the first place, that his definitions of economics are highly imprecise - the usual one is "a study of man in the everyday business of life." When it is inquired more closely what this involves we find it bifurcat- ing into two main branches: the "study of wealth" and its "more important side, a part of the study of man." This latter concerns the "ways in which man's character has been formed in the conditions of his work."2 The "study of wealth," developed by Marshall in terms of the marginal utility principle and the " Principle of Substitution, " is essen- tially "orthodox economic theory"; the "study of man" is something quite different. 1. See the writer's articles: "Wants and Activities in Marshall" and "Economics and Sociology: Marshall in Relation to the Thought of His Time," in this Journal, November, 1931 and February, 1932. 2. Principles, p. 1. 8th Edition.</page><page sequence="30">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 443 It is noteworthy that Marshall accepts on the whole the underlying assumptions of the Doctrine of Maximum Satis- faction such as competition, mobility, rationality, and, with certain qualifications, the Doctrine itself, with one, from the point of view of uthlty theory, basic exception - he refuses to accept the independence of wants from the processes of their satisfaction. Here he classifies' wants into three cate- gories: biological needs, which he sometimes refers to as " wants ' without qualification, " artificial " wants, and wants "adjusted to activities." Action connected with the first two categories may be understood directly in "utility" terms, but in the last case the wants and the activities form an inseparable unity which cannot be broken down even for analytical purposes. Thus in the "activities" in a state of mutual adjustment with wants Marshall has introduced a factor quite outside the scope of the ordinary utility theory. This is what he means when he says that "much that is of most interest in the science of wants is borrowed from the science of efforts and activities," and "if either, more than the other may claim to be the interpreter of the history of man, whether on the economic side or any other, it is the science of activities and not that of wants."4 This factor is thus conceived by him as an integral part of his economic theory. Concretely the activities and qualities of character he has in mind are those embodying the virtues, on the one hand, of energy, initiative, enterprise; on the other rationality, indus- try, frugality, honorable dealing. In such activities these virtues, the typical "economic virtues," are thought of as practiced not for ulterior motives on the principle "honesty is the best policy" but strictly as ends in themselves without thought of reward. They, as much as competition and the other "utility" elements, characterize the modern system of "free enterprise." 3. The classification is nowhere explicitly worked out but must be inferred from his treatment. See my article of November, 1931 referred to above. 4. Principles, p. 90;</page><page sequence="31">444 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The role of these "activities" may be followed straight through Marshall's thought, starting with the internal struc- ture of his more technical theory and branching out into his general social philosophy. It is their part which primarily prompts his defense of the Ricardian labor theory of value against Jevons. Only by its introduction does he maintain the classical doctrine that the total supplies of the factors of production (other than natural agents) are direct functions of their prices. At the other end of the scale, correlative with the Doctrine of Maximum Satisfaction, this forms the basis of Marshall's strong defense of freedom of enterprise, and finally, along with the process of developing rationality and emancipation from custom, it is the center of a linear theory of the process of social evolution as a whole, culminating in the development of "free enterprise." This element of a definite type of activities pursued as ends in themselves not only is something different from the orthodox theory we have discussed, it supplements it in a way radically different from the "positivistic" theories treated above. It brings ends, not the immediate end of economic acquisition but ultimate ethical values, in as a basic variable which must be taken into direct account in economic explanations. It is possible, however, for it to harmonize with the "utility theory" element, and to cause relatively little disturbance of the main outline of the competitive individualistic picture - and thus largely to have escaped detection - because it fits directly into a single logical whole with the other element. To the empirically minded the conspicuous thing in Marshall is his use of the utility analysis and his general support of competitive individualism' - not the logical grounds in- volved in the latter. But if Marshall broadened his perspec- tive to include a general comparative study of the relation of different systems of ultimate values to economic activities the picture would be very different and would bring out 5. Both in positive definition and in their use to support individu- alism Marshall's "activities" bear a striking resemblance to Professor Carver's "work-bench philosophy."</page><page sequence="32">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 445 unmistakably how radical his theoretical departure from orthodoxy really is. (b) Marshall, like the first group of positivistic empiricists we dealt with, supplements his pure utility theory with another factor -in his case, "activities." As in the other case, there has here been a group who have gone farther radically to repudiate the factors formulated in orthodox theory. The German Historical School in its various ramifications is the principal representative in this view. Going back as it does very largely to Hegelian Idealism and to historical jurisprudence for its roots, it is distinguished by two main features. On the one hand, it maintains on the whole a radical historical relativism. The attempt of orthodox theory to build up a general economic science universally applicable is held from the outset to be foredoomed to failure. The classical system was held to be simply the economics of one historical epoch and its analysis to have no validity for other times and places. Each economic organization must be con- sidered as a reality " sui generis, " as a thing by and for itself, without essential connection with others. Economics cannot hope to set up a universal system of analytical concepts but must attack each period as an entirely new problem. Secondly, in looking for the order of reality responsible for this radical historical relativity, the Historical School has tended to find it in an ethico-spiritual factor, the Volksgeist, which is an irreducible entity, above all not a psychological factor in the positivistic sense. It is fundamentally because the spiritual constitution of societies, above all their ultimate values, differ, that their economic organizations also differ. From their empiricist point of view any system of theory which attempts to abstract from these differences is necessarily inadequate. With the general empiricist tendency predominant, and hence a propensity to become immersed in historical detail, and on the other hand the impact in Germany, which tho weaker than elsewhere was by no means negligible, of western positivistic thought, the clear-cut features of this Historical</page><page sequence="33">446 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS empiricism tended, especially in the later Historical School, to become blurred over. Above all, in the work of Schmoller there are large positivistic elements; he has a great deal to say about climate, geography, race, and other such factors. But nevertheless the difference of emphasis is always marked. No German Historical economist ever placed the exclusive trust in a positivistic biological or psychological theory which has been fairly common in our own thought, and the Volks- geist has always been there, even if pushed from the place of exclusive interest. (c) It is worth while to discuss at some length, perhaps, the most important contemporary heir - rather than a repre- sentative - of the Historical School, Werner Sombart. Som- bart has, on the one hand, reacted away from the positivistic tendencies of the later historicism back to a definite if not extreme "romanticist" position. At the same time, as against the extreme empiricism of Schmoller, he has attempted not merely to write economic history but to develop a systematic theory. True to the Historical position his theory is not universal, except in the most formal sense, but is the theory of a par- ticular historical economic system, that of modern capitalism. Only one other, the pre-capitalistic, is dealt with at all, and that principally in order, through contrast, to throw the characteristics of capitalism into clear relief. In his treatment of capitalism, Sombart's principal prede- cessor is a thinker not usually reckoned to the Historical School, Karl Marx. Marx as an economic theorist in the narrow sense belonged mainly to the classical school, differing from his predecessors in that tradition mainly by his explicit recognition of the power factor and the resultant class struggle. But at the same time his economic theory was worked into a dialectical philosophy of history mainly of Hegelian origin. The most important point is that he con- sidered capitalism a definite and specific system of economic organization, marked off sharply in principle from its prede- cessor and successor in the dialectical process. From the point of view of the individual participants in the system it</page><page sequence="34">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 447 is thought of as one of compulsion, by which the individual entrepreneur is forced above all to pursue a path of unlimited acquisition. Acquisition is indeed the dominant principle of the system but not because of an inherited acquisitive pro- pensity of men - rather because placed in certain competi- tive situations there is no other type of conduct possible. The class conflict, arising out of the structure of the capital- istic enterprise which crystallizes differences of power about the class line, reinforced by the competitive pressure which keeps individuals in line, provides for Marx a dynamic ele- ment which forms the main bridge between Marx' classical economic theory and his dialectic theory of social evolution, giving a result notably different from all positivistic theories of economic change. By introducing instability into the very heart of the capitalistic system it facilitates the concep- tion of it as a unique system, peculiar in its principles of organization and limited in temporal duration. Sombart freely acknowledges his debt to Marx, stating that his own work6 is to be regarded as a continuation and he hopes completion of that of Marx. But it is very largely done by drawing Marx away from his affiliations with the English economics and laying the main stress on the "romantic" elements in the theory of capitalism. In general Marx' principal element of continuity from system to system, the class struggle, recedes far into the background and is replaced by a Wirtschaftsgeist peculiar to each system, and in each radically separated from that of the last. In fact, aside from what Sombart would regard as quite secondary elements, such as the physical conditions of eco- nomic life (limitation of natural resources, etc.), all the ele- ments of his theoretical analysis are peculiar to the one system under consideration. His departure from pure history writing is apparent in that his controlling concept, that of the eco- nomic system (Wirtschaftssystem), is explicitly abstract, an "ideal type." Its concrete counterpart, the economic epoch, is a period of history in a given area when such a system is 6. Der Moderne Kapitalismus, 2d edition, 6 volumes. This state- ment is to be found in the foreword to Vol. 5.</page><page sequence="35">448 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS predominant, with no attempt to deny that elements of other systems are present. In particular the period of con- crete transition from one system to another is always one of mixture in concrete fact. Tho the distinction in principle between two such systems is always sharp and clear, in con- crete fact they shade off almost imperceptibly. Such an economic system has, in Sombart's view, three main aspects: a Getst or "spirit," a "form of organization" and a "technique." Each aspect is characterized by certain principles which distinguish it sharply from the correspond- ing aspect of other systems. In form of organization the capitalistic system has as its unit the capitalistic enterprise which is internally organized by the division into the two classes of owner-managers on the one hand and propertyless wage workers on the other. The different elements within it) are brought into relation with each other through one mar- ket, the labor market. At the same time enterprises are related to each other and to the ultimate consumers through other markets. The whole thing is based on private initiative and competitive production for market exchange. With it is contrasted the precapitalistic handicraft form of industrial organization, differing primarily in the absence of a division into the owner and laborer classes. The connection of enterprises in competitive relations through the market makes the system as a whole acquisitive. While the "ultimate" cause of an enterprise's activity lies in the demand for its product, the immediate end of every enterprise must be the making of profit, regardless of the personal motives of individuals. Money is the quantitative common denominator of the economic order and money profit both the immediate aim of economic activity and the measure of its success. This gives the possibility of acquisi- tion losing its connection with the satisfaction of wants and becoming an end in itself. It is the "tendency of capital to reproduce itself" which Sombart takes over from Marx. To this peculiar form of organization corresponds the "spirit of capitalism"7 which, indeed, Sombart holds primarily 7. Cf. besides the Kapitalismus, Der Bourgeois.</page><page sequence="36">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 449 responsible for its creation. This he divides into two main elements, the "spirit of enterprise" and the "bourgeois spirit." The former is a product of the Renaissance, essen- tially a phase of the individual will to power. Capitalistic acquisition because of its essential lack of limitation and its impersonality offers an exceptionally favorable field for the search for power. The real creative force behind modern industrial development is this restless search for power, har- nessed to acquisition. It is inherently competitive, for power of its very essence is something we can hold only in so far as others do not hold it. At the same time there has grown up from other sources a rational, disciplined element in the cap- italistic spirit, what Sombart calls the "bourgeois spirit" (Burgergezst). This is characterized by the typical "economic virtues" of industry, frugality, thrift, careful counting of the cost. Only the coalescence of the two gives the complete picture. The three principles of the spirit of capitalism are thus acquisition, competition, rationality. With it is contrasted on each point the "precapitalistic" economic spirit. In place of acquisitiveness it has the prin- ciple of needs (Bedarfsdeckung) traditionally fixed for each according to his status in the social hierarchy. Once these needs are cared for, acquisitive activity stops. Competition to the point of yielding power over others is severely re- pressed, Finally in place of rationality is the traditionalism of the precapitalistic economy - acceptance of the ways of the fathers without question. Finally the capitalistic technology is not merely more "advanced" than the precapitalistic - it also is different in principle. That of the precapitalistic era was traditional, and empirical - its procedures were accepted from the past and the knowledge on which it rested was won from the concrete experience of the particular case. Technical knowledge was that of rules learned from a master. Capitalistic technique, on the other hand, is both rational and scientific. It is based on a rational examination of each situation and thus a new solution of its problems. Nothing is taken for granted. At the same time its intellectual basis is knowledge of scientific</page><page sequence="37">450 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS laws based on analysis applied to the particular case, and not rules derived from experience of particular cases. Perhaps nowhere does the radical nature of Sombart's thesis of the discontinuity of economic systems stand out with such startling effect as in his attempt to push it into the field of technique, where continuity of development has seemed to most to be too obvious even to need discussion. Of the three elements of the economic system it is quite clear that Sombart gives priority to the "spirit." To be sure, once the system of capitalism is fully established it tends to be self-sustaining regardless of the mental attitudes of its participants - as it was for Marx from the beginning. Each individual finds himself in a situation where it is impossible for him to act counter to the system. His existence as a member of the society would in that case be impossible. Sombart speaks of the "objectification" of the principles of the spirit of capitalism in the capitalistic enterprise itself. But these considerations do not account for the genesis of the system out of one radically different. That, Sombart holds in direct opposition to Marx, is only conceivable on the assumption that men's mental attitudes had changed and that the changed attitudes have created the form of organiza- tion. From this point of view it is to be noted that Sombart views the capitalistic order not primarily as a mechanism of want-satisfaction but as the result of men's direct pursuit of noneconomic ends, the quest of power and the exercise of the rational bourgeois virtues. Professor Mitchell's unfortunate confusion, mentioned above, makes it necessary to emphasize in conclusion that Sombart's "subjective" theory of capitalism in terms of men's mental attitude toward their economic activities is not a "psychological" theory. It is not an explanation in terms of the general properties of the human mind, but of a particular set of value-attitudes specific to modern western culture and not derived from the racial heredity of its popula- tion. The term Geist should not be allowed to deceive. This is no more individual psychology than Hegel's philosophy of the Weltgeist is behaviorism. In fact, far from being a case of</page><page sequence="38">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 451 the psychological factors which Professor Mitchell invokes to help him out of his economic difficulties, Sombart is, in terms of our classification, the extreme polar antithesis of such views. While radical behaviorism and instinct psy- chology throw out, in the explanation of concrete behavior, everything, including the "economic" element, except psychological mechanisms, whether acquired or inherited, Sombart radically minimizes everything at the positivistic end of the scale, including both the "economic" element and such mechanisms of behavior, in favor of the most radically "romantic" element of all, the unique "spirit" of a culture. It is an element the very existence of which Professor Mitchell's friends do, and to be consistent must, deny.8 This completes our sketch of theories of economics put for- ward on an empiricist basis. It is in many ways a hasty sketch, but is, I think, sufficiently full to justify drawing a few gen- eral conclusions. It may be said in the first place that these writers have all taken it for granted that the task of economic science was to supply the full theoretical explanation of a body of concrete facts, the facts of "economic life" or of "economic activities." Secondly, it may be concluded that the narrowly defined body of concepts included within orthodox economic theory, the modern "utility theory," is inadequate to this task. The attempt to rely upon it alone inevitably involves the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness," taking the part for the whole. I cannot agree with the con- tention of some of the extreme unorthodox schools that this element has no important concrete relevance at all. But neither is it possible to maintain that it is alone adequate to the task imposed upon it by an empiricist methodology. Thirdly, a striking conclusion emerges from the considera- tion of the character of the elements invoked by one or another of the unorthodox schools. That is, seen from the subjective point of view of the means-end schema, all the elements of human action which are theoretically distin- 8. For a more detailed account of Sombart's theory of capitalism, cf. the writer's article "Recent German Literature on Capitalism I," Journal of Political Economy, December, 1928.</page><page sequence="39">452 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS guishable from each other have found a place in "economic" theory at one time or another. The "positivistic" theories tend on the whole to reduce economic activities to terms of biological heredity or the external environment or some combination of both. Short of this is the tendency to emphasize technology. Then there is an important body of thought which invokes the element of coercive power in one form or another. Finally another body rests on the r6le of a system of ultimate values directly expressed in economic activities. What is the significance of this fact? There can, I think, be no doubt that in large measure these unorthodox theories are empirically right. While many of their contentions are open to criticism in detail, it seems to me quite impossible to deny in principle that any or all of these factors are relevant to the understanding not merely of concrete social life in general but of concrete economic activities. In principle all the elements of human action in general are involved in its "economic" phase -that is concrete acquisitive activities. If this conclusion be accepted it follows that an economics which adopts the empiricist position must include in its theoretical principles all the elements which are relevant to the understanding of human conduct in general. Then economics, regarded as a theoretical discipline, loses its sepa- rate identity from the other sciences dealing with human conduct. It becomes the application to a particular body of concrete facts of the body of principles which is equally applicable to any other phase of human life in society. But economics has no special title to be the final authority in the formulation of this body of principles. It is rather what has generally been called an "encyclopedic sociology,"9 a general synthesis of the theoretical results of all our knowledge of social life. Economics is then a branch of applied sociology. Short of a radical "economic interpretation of history," this conclusion is indeed inescapable on an empiricist basis. It is not, however, the only possible alternative. At the begin- 9. This is not the view of the scope of sociology to which I sub- scribe. The question will be entered into in the second part of the study.</page><page sequence="40">ELEMENTS IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT 453 ning of the second section of the study I shall take up a group of writers who have abandoned the empiricist basis altogether. Then, following up the implications of their work, I shall attempt to sketch the outline of an alternative conception of the scope of economics, and the corresponding conception of sociology, which will preserve the theoretical independence of each and yet not be in danger of succumbing to the fallacy of misplaced concreteness as the older orthodox economics so frequently did.
