' totemism is an artificial unity, existing solely in the mind of the anthropologist, to which nothing specifically corresponds in reality" writes Lévi-Strauss (1973 [Orig. 1962]; 79) advocating the thesis that totemism is nothing more than an illusory problem and yet, it is surpris- ing, such a vehement opponent of undisputable calibre did not dismiss the illusion in a paragraph or two but devoted a complete book to it illustrating the methodological details of structural analysis. This itself is a testimonial of the subject. The phenomenon of totemism has initiated remarkable interpreta- tion and analyses of data obtained by means of meticulous field-work in tribal societies particularly those of Australia in which it is supposed to have achieved expression par excellence. Totemism establishes a connec- tion between apparently diverse forms of life : humans and natural species of plants, animals or other objects called totems. This connection has been variously described by eminent scholars. The terminology of a few researchers has been reviewed by Ferreira (1965 : 47) as 'intimate' (Frazer), 'emotional' (Goldenweiser), 'mysterions' (Schmidt), 'special* (Radcliffe-Brown) and 'ideological, mystical, reverential and ki&amp;skip- engendering' (Haekel). The Concept The term totem has been defined quite simply as "a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate and altogether special relation" (Frazer 1910, I : 3). It has been found that most totemic groups observe taboo on killing or eating their totems. In most tribal societies, totems have been found to be involved in clan orga* nization and social relations. Totemism is also believed to contain cuc5 to tribal cognitive world.</page><page sequence="2">54 Indian Anthropologist [19, 1989 Totemism has been studied with two related ambitions : understand- ing hence formutating an applicable definition and utilizing this under- standing in deciphering the codes implicit in social structure, human psyche and behaviour. Several anthropologists and sociologists (Golden weiser 1912, Boas, 1916, Kroeber 1920, Firth 1930, 1931, 1970, Elkin 1933, Kaberry 1938, Sharp 1938, Durkheim 1954, Radcliffe-brown 1952, Worsley 1955, Merlan 1980) have extensively examined the etymology of the term totem, function of totems in society, their inter-relationship with descent, clan organization and institutions of kinship, religion and marriage. Areas of Origin Reviewing the contribution of Schmidt in the field, Ferreira (1965 : 25) mentions the following six chief geographical areas of totemism : (i) Oceania (Australia, Melanesia and New Guinea) and Indonesia (Moluccas and a part of Sumatra); (ii) India; (iii) Africa; (iv) Prehistoric Southwest Europe; (v) North America and (vi) South America, The Oceanian- Indonesian area is regarded as the womb of totemism where it first emerged in the Upper Palaeolithic period. Writing about the origin of totemism in India, Ferreira (1965 : 225) forwards two hypotheses : either totemic elements were brought into India from outside (through the process of migration or diffusion) or totemism developed from indigenous proto-totemic elements in the country. Although no conclusive evidence on the validity of either of the alternatives is available, the scales appear to be heavily tipped in favour of the second one. The original bearers of totemism has been described as belonging to an ethnic group which was pre-Aryan, pre- Dravidian and pre-Munda. Totemism in India is thus believed to be ancient. Evolutionary Perspective Indian totemism has been examined extensively by anthropologists. However, these studies were undertaken, as most others, with a funda- mental assumption that the phenomenon of totemism is linked only with tribal societies. Several tribes belonging to different parts of the country have been searched for totemic elements. A large number of generalizing principles, propositions, conjectural statements both complementary and contradictory have emerged from such studies. One locus of consensus has been the classification of this form of religion as 'elementary' or 'primitive' and its allocation to basal position ia the evolutionary sequence.</page><page sequence="3">nīta mathurJ Totemism in Caste Communities 55 The evolutionary theory of Darwin so pervaded the intellectual climate that inspite of germinating from biology, it was profitably applied to social sciences including anthropology and the issue of religion could not escape evolutionary interpretation. In his scheme of religion, Lubbock (1971 [Orig. 1870] •' 169-171) demonstrated the evolution of totemism from its proceeding stage : fetichism. The consecutive stages in religious thought as conceived by Lubbock are : Atheism, Fetichism, totemism, Shamanism and athropomorphism. The last named is postu- lated to be succeeded by one in which the deity is regarded as a super- natural being not merely part of nature. In the final stage, morality gets associated with religion, Though Frazer (1910, IV: 16-18) expresses that totemism is not incompatible with pastoral, agricultural commercial or industrial societies it continues to be studied predominantly in the context of tribal societies. The scope of studies on totemism has been limited to to tribal societies. Literature on the subject are found to be teeming the names of tribes and their social organizations. The trend of identifying totemism only with tribes has retarded the initiative of executing similar studies in non-tribal situations. The result of this declivity has been the absence (or negligibly small number if any) of reports on non-tribal totemism. In this context, the present study may be considered as an inaugural one. This article is aimed at examining totemism in the Mathur among whom fieldwork was undertaken in 1986-19871. Totems representing the first few steps on the evolutionary ladder have been preserved by the Mathur. This community defies all other characteristics of simple societies and by no measure can it be labelled as 'tribal'. This article deals with the operational and ideological dimensions of totemism. Ethnotheory of Origin and Continuity of the Mathur The Mathur are integrated with the Kayastha caste which is consti- tuted of eleven other subcastes (see figure 1). The ancestral Kayastha, Chitragupta by name, is believed to have emerged from the Kaya or body of Brahma*. The theory of origin of Chitragupta from the entire body of Brahma rather than from one or the other body part poses serious problem in classification of the Kayastha within the Varna fold which postulates the birth of Brahmin, Kshtriya, Vaisya and Sudra from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet of Brahma respectively. Kayasths have bjen variously labelled as Brahmin due to high rate of literacy, Kshtriya due to their prolonged association with rulers, Vaisya by virtue of trad- ing and business skills and Sudra because of the tendency to serve others</page><page sequence="4">56 Indian Anthropologist [19, 1989 (Sastri 1931 : 131-133, Leonard 1978 : 12, Saksena 1990 : 19). In the light of divergent opinions and controversy, Kayasthas prefer to place themselves the beyond the pail of Varna classification. According to a belief, "Brahma creatcd the four Varnas , then summoned forth the Kayastha, with pen and ink pot already in hand, to record the activities of all other men. This first Kayasth was named Chitragupta, and he became reversed as founder and patron deity of the community. Chitragupta' s chief employment was as a recordkeeper for Yama, the god of death in Hindu mythology, for whom he recorded all the good and bad deeds of men" (Leonard 1971 : 12). Chitragupta is said to be bigamous. By their own account, Kayastha communities or endogamous divisions have descended from the male progeny of Chitragupta and his wives. The story of descent of Kayastha subcastes as recorded by Bhatnagar (1978 : B3, 90, 91) Leonard (1978 : 12-73) is illustrated in Figure 1. Mathur Kayasthas are said to have ruled over Ayodhya. In the vedic age, their descendants held the office of Dewan for several years. Downfall of Mathur rule commenced during the Dewanship of Bal Pratam Mathur. Finally, power was handed to Maharaja Dalip who brought back the prosperity and fame to the area which had hitherto declined considerably. Dalip was succeeded by Aj, Raghu and Dashratha in the mentioned sequence. Mathurs are also evidenced to have ruled over Mathura and adjoining areas after defeating the Dravidas. Their rule continued till 322 B.C. after which the area was administrated by the Central Government (Bhatnagar 1978 : 98, 99). The Mathur Community : Important Characteristics For several years, Mathurs have residentially occupied the state of Uttar Pradesh. In Delhi, the field area in which this research was carried out, they are concentrated in the walled city, more so in Cheerakhana, Nai Sadak and Chelpuri. A few distinguishing characteristics of the Mathur may be recorded at the outset. First, Mathurs, like other Kayasthas "functioned in the secular and interactional framework of the Mughal administration" (Leonard 1978 : 8). Their association with Muslims is amply demonstrated by the generous usage of Urdu words in conversation and more importantly by their fluency in reading and writing Urdu language. Second, Mathurs are worshippers of pen, ink and paper. They are identified as 'the writing group'. Third, traditio- nally, the Mathur was a land holding group. Presently, a majority of Mathurs are employed in the public sector as engineers, chartered</page><page sequence="5">nīta mathur] Totemìsm in Caste Communities 57 accountants, doctors, lawyers, administrators and in similar occupations. Fourth, membership in the community is hereditary and is maintained by the strict observance of endogamy. Exogamy is regarded as a devia- tion and is discouraged by the imposition of sanctions such as social isolation and ridicule. Fifth, one observes nepotism exhibited by the tendency to clump, form associations and organize friendly meetings. Such occasions breed familiarity and group solidaritp by providing fertile opportunity to discuss personal and familial affairs, trace kinship and extend marital negotiations. A Mathur individual begins to recognize distant kins, identify and be identified as part of the larger group hence enlarge the circumference of community acquaintance. Sixth, Mathurs are divided into exogamous groups called als defined as, "Hindu patri- lineage of clan, designated by eommon name, within which marriage is not allowed" (Leonard 1978 : xv). Mathur Totemìsm The number of Mathur als , according to Bhatnagar is ninety-five out of which the following are relatively more common : Jalashree, Kakrania, Maoobia, Ghee-dal, Mahavani. Galghotiya, Beraliya, Manak Bhandari and Charcholi. The members of one clan or al regard them- selves as of one blood bound together by faith in a particular totem. Table 1 is a presentation of few Mathur clans and their totems. The list of clans and totem is, by no means, complete or exhaustive primarily because of non-representation of several clans in the field area. The association of two or more als with the same totem supports the theme of fission of clans in the past. It appears fair to conjecture that origi- nally there were few clans which by the repeated process of fission multi- plied to yield the unexpectedly large number. Clan totemism encountered in the Mathur conforms to the follow- ing prominent markers of the phenomenon as emergent from earlier adthropological studies : reverence and fear toward totems, identification, close approximation and kinship relation with totems, presence of totemic emblems, rituals and taboos connected with totems and inheri- tance of totems along line of descent. The totem is callcd Kuldev . The term is derived from two syllables : kul denoting the entire totemic group and ciev meaning god. Members of the same totemic group or al are believed to the descendents of a common ancestor who is postulated to have maintained, what has been called, parallel relationship (defined as the "belief that ancestor of the human group had experiences with the totem of a pleasant kind, the</page><page sequence="6">58 Indian Anthropologist [19, 1989 totem animal appearing as friend or helper or as enemy" cf. Ferreira 1965 23) with the totem. The relationship between clan ancestor and totem is revealed in the following illustrative theme. According to the myth, an infecund couple prayed for the birth of a child. A son was born after some period of time. The parents, who considered the event of birth as a manifestation of the god's compassion evoked as a fruition of their prayers decided to visit the temple at the summit of a hill in order to communicate their gratitude. It was difficult to climb with the neophyte in the arms and they decided to leave him at the foothill. In the absence of any caretaker, the neonate lay unprotected. On returning, the parents were surprised to see an owl with its wings extended over the child. Assuming that the bird had been guarding the neonate in their absence, the parents overcome with awe and gratitude, worshipped the owl. The descendant generations of this boy formed the clan Beraliya the members of which recognize owl as their totem. Believing themselves akin to their totems, the people do not kill or eat them. If a snake appears in the house of a Mahavani it is worshipped and fed with milk before a charmer is called. The snake charmer is instructed against killing it anywhere in the area around the honses. Similarly, an owl, wherever it may be seen, is not disturbed, rather, it is revered with offerings of rice, grains and water. Some people do not spreak of totems by their proper names and descriptive epithets as 'one with hood' for snake and 'king of nighť for owl are employed as alter- native. This practice is related with a belief that they understand human speech. The objective of such circumlocutions is to give no offence to reverential totems fearing that if heard being called disrespectfully as by being referred to by their names, they would cause harm to the family. The penalties supposed to be incurred due to wrath of the totem (kalled khor) pertain to ill-health. By their own record, once an infor- mant economized on offerings to the kuldev . The eldest son of the family fell sick. His sister saw the totem in her dream and was thence reminded of the negligence. The following day, essential offerings were made and forgiveness was begged. The boy subsequently began respond- ing to medicines. In another instance, the person who directed attack on an otnerwise injured snake fell ill and in a dream the totem threaten- ed his life. It was pacified by a promise to gift clothes to a Brahmin boy which implicated their reception by the kuldev. Dreams about the anger of totems and its consequences arc associated with the emotion of fear instilled and also reinforced by oral tradition involving narration of totemic myths.</page><page sequence="7">NITA ma f hur] Totemism in Caste Communities 59 The relation between clan persons and totem is that of mutuality. If people respect and care for their totems, they expect that the totems will do the same by them. Whether plants or ferocious animals, birds or characters from the mystical world, all the totems are believed to possess magical powers which impart a feeling of security to the clans- people. The people of al with snake as the totem hold that the world rests on the hood of the snake and thereby snake is the most powerful amongst all totems. Those with owl as the totem feel that an owl can see at night and being ferocious by nature can well protect the group. Further, the al with Anjini, Krishna or one of the goddesses is their totem are satisfied with their supernatural powers. The sense of security provided by totems is reciprocated by the attitude and display of respect to them. Totems are regarded as sacred and objects of ritual paraphernalia. They are worshipped on the occasions of marriage, a ritual in the seventh month of pregnancy {santwasa' birth of a male child, head shaving ( sirkaj ) and ear-piercing. On the particular occasion, 250 grams each of saturated fat and jaggery are offered to the totem by placing these near the totemic representation along with money (usually the amount is Rs. 115), 1-1.5 kg betashae (a sweet) and white cloth. These are later divided into three equal parts which are given away to the ego's Father's sister, a Brahmin and the ego respectively. Some clans (e.g. galghotiya) offer a preparation of 5 kg. gram flour ( hathpuri ), money (Rs. 1.15), rice and flowers, while yet others (e.g. Kakrania) render worship only with simple articles like water and rice. In all the clans there is only a definite category of persons that worships the totem. Beraliya clan prescribes only widows and men for this purpose while in most other totemic groups only married women render service to the totems. The spinsters, in some clans, are prohibited from entering the room in which the totem is installed leave aside the permission for its ritualized worship. Prior to worship, hands are washed, the head is covered, eyes are closed and the palms are joined at the level of chest. The totems of Beraliya and Kakrania are culturally concretized as engraving on silver coins. Mahavanis retain the totem of snake as silver motifs of approximately 2.5 inches in length with a fanned hood and sinuous tail. The Chaturbhuji devi of galghotiya clan is not represented as motifs or constructs, neither as engraving on coins nor as idols. It is symbolized by the positive imprint (the hand is smeared with a paste of rice powder and turmeric in water called aaipan) of the right hand on the wall. The act of creating the symbol on the wall is performed by</page><page sequence="8">60 Indian Anthropologist [19, Î9&amp;9 a Brahmin or an elderly woman of the house who, in most cases, happens to be the mother-in-law succeeded by the eldest-daughter-in- law. The inheritance of totems follows the patrilineal line : sons acquire totemic affiliation from their fathers while daughters adopt the totems of their affines. The totemic motifs or coins are borrowed by the brothers of a family and their descendants from each other. Such borrowing or sharing continues for at least till three generations after which indepen- dent constructs may be maintained. This is instrumental in perpetuating familiarity and contact with kins and also in keeping count of generations which strengthens clan solidarity both at the ideological and practical levels. Mathurs have been heard discussing their descent and kinship network at length. Infact, conversation between two Mathurs (unknown to each other) is triggered (and continues for a long period of time some- times extending to a couple of hours or more) when one of them initiates the topics of descent, kinship, clan membership and totems. The con- versation usually includes even minor details regarding ritual accompani- ment of totem worship. People belonging to the same clan or different clans but revering the same totem feel 'naturally close' to each other. They may be heard disclosing their als and expressing the sentiment in the following words, "Oh ! so we belong to the same al. This is good." The connection between totemism and marriage in the Mathur situation appears to be faint and indirect. The role of totems in marri- ages is limited only to the maintenance of clan exogamy. Totems do not structure marriage networks or social relations. The members of a clan are not, subjected to prescriptive rules of marriage with regard to other clans and clans characterized by antagonistic totems (as snake and eagle, the latter kills snakes) have been found to engage in alliance and friendly relationships with each other. Conclusions The system of totems prevailing in the Mathur does not include only plant and animal species. A number of deities of the great tradition of hinduism are also labelled as kuldev in some totemistic septs. Mathur totems are : Banayan tree, Monkey, Owl, Eagle, Chaturbhuji devi, Durga Devi and Krishna. The totems are broadly classifiable into the follow- ing three groups : plant kingdom, animal kingdom and mythical deities which may be arranged in the aforementioned sequence. The pattern exhibits inherent evolutionary indications on the following counts : progression in mobility capacity and intelligence. While plants are</page><page sequence="9">nīta mathur] Totemìsm in Caste Communities 61 stationary, animals represent a slightly advanced stage in that they have acquired the capacity to move. The movement is, however, limited in the spacio-temporal framework. The deities are believed to have trans- cended the variables of space and time. They are assigned the feature of omnipresence. Similarly, plants, animals and deities are characterized by an improvement in sentience and intelligence. The inclusion of certain deities within the fold of totemism is indi- cative of a transitional stage in which one form of religion considered as 'elementary' matures into a more 'evolved* one. The coexistence of hindu deities and species of plants and animals as totems confirms the evolutionary sequence of religion proposed by Lubbock (1978 [Orig. 1870] : 169-170). In the Mathur, a shift from the stage of totemism to anthropomorphism is visible. Notes 1. I recall with gratitude the encouragement received from Dr. V.C. Channa and Sukanta Kumar Chaudhury. Soumendra Mohan Patnaik offered some profitable suggestions on an earlier version of this article. Nilika Mehrotra gave useful and critical comments on the original manuscript. 2. Brahma, in hindu, mythology, is regarded as the creator of the universe. 3. Anjini as a totem refers to female monkey believed to be the mother of Hanuman. Both Anjini and Hanuman are characters from the epic Ramayana .
