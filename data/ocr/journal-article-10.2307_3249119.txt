<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. T. Devendra: Classical Sinhalese Sculpture, ca. 3 o o B. C. to A. D. iooo. London, 19y8, (IV), 48pp., 2z8 ills., I map. This volume is concerned with the body of Sinhalese sculpture which developed at Anurddhapura prior to about iooo A. D. Dedicated to the proposition that Sinhalese works of art "... have a right to be classed separately from the productions of India proper", the author is concerned lest apparent Indian analogues be used to judge and date Sinhalese sculptures. Also, he confronts scholars once again with his hypothesis that the Buddha image was first developed in Ceylon. Mr. Devendra has illustrated his book copiously with ex- cellent general views and details of various sculptures. Among the i 28 photographs, handsomely reproduced in this small format volume, a large number are new, while a number of almost completely neglected ob- jects are brought again to our attention. This new source of visual material, added to the photographs of Buddha images in the author's previous The Buddha Image and Ceylon (Kandy, 1957), provides us with a useful reference supplement. While it is true that Sinhalese art has always had some- thing of its own special character, we cannot force the issue so far that we deny obvious stylistic connections with Indian forms. Mr. Devendra often does this, or avoids the issue altogether. In this regard, he does not even consider the problem of the origin of the early export bronzes, which is still much disputed. Neither does he admit the relationship of the early stone sculptures to Andhra forms, although certain motifs from the early sculptured stelae at Anurddhapura demand comparison with Sdfichi and Amardvati types. Furthermore, certain slabs (figures io8, io9) are with- out question imports from the Andhrade'a, although the author insists otherwise. And finally, he dismisses, with a mere reference to their "fancied analogy", the stylistic connections between the so-called Kapila figure from the Isurumuniya Vihdra (to take one example) and the seventh century sculpture at Mdmal- lapuram. "Style", Mr. Devendra says, "has been too frequently emphasized in dating." He has said in The Buddha Image and Ceylon (p. 81), that in the quest "... to isolate the essentials of a Ceylon image, arrive at a reasonable chronological datum, and test for the pos- sible origins of the Buddha image in the Island... (we) must boldly evaluate the written records" (italics his). In his present book, he reminds us that the Ma- hbvamrsa attributes a stone Buddha to the reign of Devdnampiydtissa. He boldly continues: "Today, in the seclusion of parkland there is a seated Buddha... It seems more than probable that this is the earliest Bluddha image anywhere in the Buddhist world." (Italics mine.) To an eye more partial to "style" the famous image in question (illustrated in Coomaraswamy's History of Indian and Indonesian Art, Fig. 295) has obvious affini- ties with Indian images from about the Gupta period. As in other cases (e.g. on pages i2, i8, 33, etc.) no picture of the object under discussion is included. No explanation is given for the author's unorthodox chronology of early Sinhalese kings on page 43; for instance, Devinampiydtissa, usually assigned to ca. 247-207 B. C., is assigned to "? 307-247 B. C." If textual references to early Buddha images lend ap- parent support to the author's controversial opinions, how do we explain their occurrence ? In one important case the explanation seems clear. The Mahbvamsa re- ference mentioned above (Ch. xxxvi, verses i28 ff.) refers to "the great and beautiful stone image that was placed of old by Devdnampiyitissa in the Thfparama." But the reference occurs in an account of King Jettha- tissa's reign (third century A. D.). Since the record of Devdnampiyitissa's reign, in the same text, fails to mention any such important event, we might well suppose the later mention to be a later and inconsist- ent interpolation. Devendra is aware of this problem and has argued in his previous book (page 34) that "the omission to refer to it would be an important omission only if Buddha images had been considered sacred objects in the third century before Christ." But we may counter, that the very occurrence as well as the nature of the statement, implies the sanctity of the image mentioned. Another reference which the author mentions (unfor- tunately again omitting the precise source - Mahd- vamsa Ch. xxx, verses 7i if. - states that King Dut- thaggmani, who constructed the colossal Ruvanveli 266</page><page sequence="2">dagoba, caused "a shining golden Buddha-image" to be seated on a throne in the relic-chamber. But as Mr. Devendra has pointed out previously, the central theme of this passage is the image of the Bodhi Tree around which all else is said to have been placed. The reference to the anthropomorphic image is again undoubtedly a later interpolation. Indeed the whole oppressively florid description of the relic- chamber, with its fabulous jewel-encrusted tree sur- rounded by all manner of scenes and ornaments, brings to mind many of the qualities of the developed reliefs from Amarivati. The Mahbvaymsa, taking its final form at about the same time, intensely reflects the same age. Facts and faith alike have been caught up and transformed by the fervor of its compilers. We can use the Mahdvaamsa as an immensely revealing, but not an historically reliable document. Many factors disallow the likelihood of a third cen- tury B. C. Sinhalese Buddha image. For instance, the very fact that, as Devendra states, Ceylon's art "... never went through a phase where aniconic represen- tations were the rule," may be of significance. By the second and third centuries A. D., when the Mahdyana doctrine was flourishing in India, anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha are found in increasing numbers, and as the cult grows in the next few cen- turies such representations largely replace the ani- conic forms. Whereas it has been assumed that the growth of Mahayana doctrines sponsored this anthro- pomorphizing, it is more valid to see them as parallel, rather than as dependent, developments. The two developments were equally supported by the growth of the attitudes of "bhakti" - by that assertive emo- tionalism which wished both the means and the ends of salvation specifically and elaborately identified, and insisted on a god in human guise, for all of his increasingly supernal nature. Sinhalese sculptural production, judging from the re- mains, probably included anthropomorphic imagery from the start. This, together with the fact that there is little of the obsession with the "animistic pantheon" which is so dominant in Sunga and early Andhra sculpture, makes it appear that Sinhalese sculpture was only undertaken at a more advanced date. It seems to have been begun at a time when pious interests were strongly centered on the image per se, and when the basic canons for the image had already been developed. As is commonly admitted, the early Sinhalese stone Buddhas are related in style to the Buddha images of the Amarivati school dating from the second and third centuries A. D. These latter images show a con- sistent development, in their details and general form, from the earliest figure types to be found in the same region. The very fact that similar "prototypes" do not appear in Ceylon supports the view that the early Sin- halese Buddhas have no indigenous evolution, but are derivative in style from the mature Amardvati forms they so closely resemble. Besides the Buddhas, other early Sinhalese sculptures show a dependence on Indian forms. For instance, Devendra reproduces many details from the stelae which were set up at early stupas around Anurddha- pura. The figures of attendant ndgas, chauri-bearers and the like which appear upon them, in their well- articulated poses, their pronounced fleshiness, and the nature of their costumes, bring to mind second cen- tury A. D. Indian sculptures from the stambha and the verandah at Kanheri, and from Ndsik and Ama- rdvati. But they often show a disciplined svelteness which hints of a relationship with Gupta and Pallava works (see figures 96-99). Very often Sinhalese sculptures of this early phase impress one as transi- tional in their style between the voluptuously con- ceived carvings of the Amardvati apogee and the much more tautly controlled works from Pallava times. In North India, the canonical disciplines de- veloped for sculpture between the early and the me- dieval periods can be seen by refering to Gupta works. In South India proper this interim phase is largely missing, but Sinhalese works provide a most intri- guing kind of missing link to aid us in a hypothetical reconstruction of the South Indian stylistic develop- ments. At the same time that the stelae figures discussed a- bove declare a relationship with later Andhra works in their general modelling, they also recall the guardi- an figures on the Sdfichi gate-jambs in pose and place- ment. The same relationship with Sdfichi is evident when we examine certain decorative and symbolic motifs on the stelae. The basic form of many of the motifs, notably the vertical "lotus-shaft" from which paired men and beasts spring forth (Figs. I-8; 24-27) could well be derived from details at Safichi (e. g. west pillar of north gate). But the Sinhalese forms tend to be rendered with a facility which becomes mechanical, any strong sense of articulated design becoming at- tenuated in the process. The easily handled figures and floral motifs are routinely laid out on the surface, and show none of that vigorous yet hopeless demand for space which is part of the dramatic and never-quite- 267</page><page sequence="3">achieved struggle at Sdfichi. In these early stelae the rock in no sense erupts into life - figures merely exist against it; the meandering lotuses form com- partments rather than burgeoning coils (Figs. 20-23); the sprouting floral forms emerge from their jars in meagre spindles (Figs. 16, 24, 25). Yet in all fairness it must be said that these occasional thin and overly eclectic products are more than com- pensated for by the sculptural strength of many of the large Sinhalese Buddhas, to say nothing of the exuberant plastic delights of the well-known makara balustrades, guardian nigas, and Isurimuniya figures.
