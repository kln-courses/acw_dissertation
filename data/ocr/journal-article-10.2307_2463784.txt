<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRACES OF SOLAR WORSHIP IN NORTH AMERICA. BY EDWIN A. BARBER. In an article published in the October NATURALIST, entitled " On the Ancient and Modern Pueblo Tribes of the Pacific Slope of the United States," the writer made use of the following ex- pression: "Both paid homage to the sun, or at least looked for a Messiah daily to come to them from the east," to which asser- tion exceptions have been taken by some ethnologists. It is held by this class of scientists that the heavenly bodies were never deified by any of the American races. Granting this to be, in some degree, true: That the luminaries, collectively</page><page sequence="2">1878.] Traces of Solar Worskip in Northi Ameurica. 229 or individually, were not elevated to the 1ug-/iest place in their worship, by any tribe or people in North America, yet the celes- tial orbs, nevertheless, figured prominently in the list of supreme objects of worship, and many traces, at least, of this form of wor- ship are found in the religions of aboriginal races of all ages, from the oldest American people down to the tribes of the present day,. especially among those versed in astrology or astronomy. Although little is known of the Toltecs of Ancient Mexico, it is an established fact that astral worship existed among them. They paid homage to the sun and dedicated their earliest temples to him. The moon, also, they reverenced as his wife and the stars were believed to be his sisters, according to the Mexican Licentiate, Don Mariano Veytia, in his " Historia Azinzlua." The same writer describes the ruins of San Juan Teotihuacan, the most ancient architectural remains of Mexico, situated about thir- teen miles north-east of the capital city. Of these, the largest pyramid, which measured six hundred and eighty feet in length at the base and was estimated at two hundred and twenty feet in height, was dedicated to Tonatinh or Tonatricli, the sun; the next structure in size and importance was inscribed to Meztli, the moon. On the summit of the former a temple was erected in which was placed an immense statue representing the sun, which faced toward the east. According to the accounts of Bernardino de Sahagun, a Spanish writer of the sixteenth century, and one wvho was particularly cautious in his deductions and entirely reliable in his accounts of the religion of the Aztecs, as set forth in his " Historia Universal de Naeva Espafia," solar and lunar worship occurred in the Aztec religion, the sun with them being a spiritual conception. They believed that the heroes who fell in battle or died in captivity, or women who died in childbirth. were immediately transported into the House of the Sun, where they led a life of everlasting delight. From the broad tops of their teocalb's or temples, the Aztec priests were in the habit of performing impressive, and, in too many cases, bloody ceremonies, in which the heavenly bodies were made to take a prominent part. After the fall of the Mexican Empire, traces of sun worship were common. Captain Fernando Alarcon, in the year 1540, mentioned having met, on the Colorado River, Indians who wor- shiped the sun.</page><page sequence="3">230 Traces of Solar TWorshizp ins North America. [April, The same custom exists among the modern Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. Lieut. A. W. Whipple says of these people that " they are now anxiously expecting the arrival of Montezuma; and it is related that in San Domtingo (one of the nineteen Pueblo towns), every morning at sunrise, a sentinel climbs to his house- top, and looks eastward, to watch for his coming." Mr. Whipple also gives a tradition' of these Indians which assigns Acoti (another Pueblo village, situated on the Rio Grande del Norte, the ancient Tiguex) as his birth-place; but the tale is so at variance with facts and so rich in imagination that it is evi- dently the invention of some fertile brain. The Spaniards who came among the Pueblos, just after the Mexican conquest, about the year 1539, evidently introduced the name of Montezuma and probably instilled into their minds this idea of his second advent. Thus the worship of heavenly bodies may have become blended with the deification of ancestors; then the sun may have taken the name of Montezuma. Whipple' further states that they "smoke to the sun that he may send them antelope to kill, In- dians to trade with, and save them from enemies." Among the Navajos, also, by the same authority, "The sun, moon and stars are sacred, as the authors of seasons of rain and of harvest." He also says of the Zunians, " Beneath the apparent mul- tiplicity of gods, these Indians have a firm faith in the Deity, the unseen Spirit of God. His name is above all things sacred, and like Jehovah of the Jews, too holy to be spoken. Montezuma is His son and their king. The sun, moon and stars are His works, worthy of their adoration." The " ancient Pueblos" of the Pacific slope of the United States, whose ruined stone structures are found so numerously through- out portions of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and proba- bly Nevada, held the sun in high esteem, at least, if they did not worship it. This is shown in the situation of the houses in many localities. In the Canion of the Rio lMfancos,2 for example, the dwellings are almost invariably found secreted in the cliffs of the western bluff, and from their roofs the inhabitants were wont to salute the king of day as he raised himself above the eastern plateau. 1 Vol. III, Pacific R.

The religion of their forefathers seems to have de- generated into a mere custom, the origin of which has been long lost sight of in their obscure traditions. Thus, in the course of time, it seems probable, the worship of celestial orb~s has given place to hero-worship; solar worship to anthropomorphism, and it is said that the Moquis have ultimately become imbued with the belief that it is a Messiah, in the form of one of their own an- cestors, that is, Montezuma,l whom they are expecting to arrive from the east. The Moquis and the Pueblos and Zuliis are cog- nate tribes and doubtless remnants of the ancient Nahuatlac races; hence the similarity of their customs. As the faint streak of red lights up the low horizon, tall, dark figures appear on the parapets of the seven Moqui towns and re- main facing the dawn until the sun has appeared entirely to view. Then the muffled forms drop away slowly and sadly, one by one, for another morn has brought disappointment to the souls of many that have watched so eagerly and persistently for the coin- ing of the great Montezuma. The routine of another Moqui day has commenced; all is bustle and life and the subdued hum of household occupation floats out drowsily on the sullen, sultry air and the sound of the hundred flour-mills (melauis) grinding steadily on every side, seems, as it issues from the doors and win- dows of the stone houses, to pause in mid-air like a droning bee. Then scores of busy figures repair with their water-vessels to the verge of the steep bluffs, and disappear in the crevices of the rocks below. Having presented these facts in support of the assumption that solar adoration entered, to some extent, into the religions of some of the American races, we may sum them up briefly as follows: i. Fetichism being the commonest form of idolatry, especially amongst the lower races of man, most tribes whose religion is polytheistic, venerate the sun. 2. We can detect vestiges of sun-worship in the ruins of the Toltec and Aztec temples and. pyramids and also in the statues which were placed within them. 3. \We can observe traces of it in the traditions and observances of savage and semi-civilized tribes at the present day. 4. We notice indications of it in the hieroglyphics or picture- 1 Motecuhzumna.</page><page sequence="5">232 A New Locality for Cordylopl/ora.

Finally, we can observe signs of this worship in the orienta- tion of dead bodies in graves. If we accept these briefly stated facts, there can be no reason- able doubt that the worship of the sun entered, to some degree, into the religions of the American aborigines; how far, we have not the means of determining; yet, quoting the poet Southey's words, w" I marvel not, O sun! that unto thee In adoration man should bow the knee, And pour the prayer of mingled awe and love; For like a god thou art, and on thy way Of glory sheddest, with benignant ray, Beauty, and life, and joyance from above."</page></plain_text>
