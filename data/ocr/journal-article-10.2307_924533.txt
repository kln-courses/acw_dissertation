<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANCE REVIEWS Dance-Rituals of Manipur, India, by Louise Lightfoot. (Hong Kong: The Standard Press, Ltd, 1960. 79 pp.) Dance-Rituals of Manipur, by Louise Lightfoot, is an account of the Australian author's two-season visit (1951-1952) to Manipur to do research on the ancient Meitei forms of dance still extant in this Indian protectorate. Pre-Hindu and highly anthropomorphic in inspiration, the Meitei forms are 240</page><page sequence="2">different from the fare served most Westerners under the Manipuri label. Most of us are usually exposed either to a mish-mash of gyrations or the Ras Lilas, a later, Hinduized dance form bearing only faint traces of Meitei roots. Miss Lightfoot is painstaking in her presentation as well as aware of the lack of context most Westerners bring to her subject. While her prose is not facile, the reader is left convinced of the soundness of the author's knowledge and the quiet, all-pervading devotion she gives to dance. The slim volume should be welcomed by anyone genuinely interested in dance forms. San Francisco, Calif. Renee Renouf Hall</page></plain_text>
