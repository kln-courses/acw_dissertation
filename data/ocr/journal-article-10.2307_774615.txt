<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Allen S. Weller, Editor Langdon Warner Japanese Sculpture of the Tempyo Period: Master- pieces of the Eighth Century, edited and arranged by James Marshall Plumer, text, xxii - 165 pp., 5 ill., 2 maps; 217 collotype plates, boxed. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959. $50.00. "This book stands for a man and an era. And the era stands for that which is great in other eras-as the author stands amongst men. The two, man and era, Warner and Tempyo, were closely associated through the better part of a half a century." Thus the late Professor James M. Plumer introduces this significant posthumous work and the or- dered cadence of these sentences tells much about the flavor of the volume, for the book is filled with a kind of simple grandeur which is at once a testimony to the nature of the two men who made it possible and a clue to the meaning of the art about which they write. There is "Part One: The Period" and "Part Two: The Sculpture," and the first two chap- ters of Part One will already be familiar from having been printed as the opening sections in Mr. Warner's well-known The Enduring Art of Japan. But whereas the latter then branches out into other historical eras, this volume re- stricts itself quite naturally (with some slight overlapping) to the period it proposes to discuss: Tempyo Japan (710-794). In not un- familiar traditional doctrine, Buddhism is seen as the great source of the arts and, work- ing from the top down with imperial decrees and learned texts, it reached "plebians" only indirectly. But it is always to the craftsman that the author leans: "Buddhism paid the crafts- man's wages and prescribed what he must make. .. . Of course the image-maker, the gilder, the bronze caster, the lacquerer, the tile- maker, and even the lads who ran errands for them, knew more than a little about Buddhist gods." (p. 33) The stage is thus set for image- making. It is one of the merits of this general discus- sion, however, that the author seeks for wider explanations. Shinto gods bowed to imported Indian deities, but Confucianism is not to be overlooked despite its absence in Tempyo sculpture, for it shaped "other arts": govern- ment, deportment, literature, logic, music, cal- ligraphy. Through such famous emissaries as Kibi no Makibi and Abe Nakamaro we are brought to a suggestion of the splendors of im- perial, international T'ang China. Problems of travel to that greatest of countries are briefly described, and a short chapter is de- voted to one of the most significant travellers of the day, the Chinese priest, Chien Chen, or Ganjin, as he was known in Japan-even down to a list of some of the principal precious ob- jects this great divine brought with him (1 glass jar made in India, 20 stems of green lotus, more than 3 bushels of Bo tree nuts for rosa- ries . . .). To this point little enough has been said about sculpture. Now, however, we deal di- rectly with this art in a most illuminating chap- ter on "Lacquer Sculpture" which, from some early traces in the seventh century, truly flour- ished in Tempyo times. Imperial orders went out for the planting of trees, and young men "of a certain status" were taxed "about a pint" of lacquer juice a year. Of particular interest is the description of a hollow dry lacquer technique which starts with the figure mod- elled in clay: "From this figure he took a mold, a procedure in which bronze casters of Tempyo must long have been skilled. The in- side of this mold was then painted and smeared with lacquer in which powdered cedar bark had been mixed as a stiffener." (p. 58) While the connection with bronze-casting is thus indicated it might, too, have been well to see in this process a relation to those unusual Tempyo masterpieces, unbaked clay statues this is indeed, mentioned later in notes on individual statues, p. 85)-in part affirming a technical unity in what was so patently a time of other unities-governmental, religious, stylistic. Only wood-carving would suggest a major technical difference, and wooden stat- ues, at least as they survive, seem to reflect not so much the glory as the twilight of the period (cf. pp. 131-138, and Sherwood F. Moran, "Structural Features of Clay Sculpture of the Nara Period," Artibus Asiae XXIII, 1960, pp. 64-5). While these essays do not really add up to a systematic study of the period-and thus to some extent reflect the posthumous nature of the work-there is perhaps a necessary, almost deliberate incompleteness in the written parts of the volume. Author and editor are really trying to get us to sense the "feel" of the period: "It is more important in this study to grasp the simple fundamentals and feel drawn toward the undoubted truths that lie deep in this religion than to probe all the re- finements of sectarian doctrines or learn to thread a devious path through an unfamiliar inconography." (p. 35) Thus steering clear of that tremendous elaboration of detail and subtle metaphysical speculation which is cer- tainly to be found in Buddhist thought, Mr. Warner would place himself, characteristically, in the shoes or sandals of the image maker and immerse himself in the technical aspects of the craft. The carver's knife must not be neg- lected. Quoting Eric Gill with approval: "If we can bring ourselves to look squarely at the things themselves . . . we are at once made free of a whole fresh country of delight." (p. 73) We are thus brought to the point of study- ing what from this view must be the most im- portant aspect of the volume: the collotype plates. These comprise 217 separate sheets (approximately 12" by l51/2") with often more than one view on a plate. Sometimes one is brought close to a detail; sometimes the whole object is shown. They are eminently suitable for display and thus constitute an im- portant teaching tool. The whole, including text, fits into a handsome brocaded box. Casual reader and advanced student will wish to explore this material at will, following the careful arrangement according to technique: bronze, clay, hollow lacquer, lacquer with lattice support, lacquer with wood core, lac- quered carved wood and wood. Here we can- not speak in detail, but one might note that among images and groups of images it is the magnificent assemblage at T6daiji's Sangat- sudo (Hokkedo)-Hall of the Third Month -that perhaps profits most from Mr. Warner's notes. Assembling so much and presenting it with such taste, Japanese Sculpture of the Tempyo Period may perhaps lead to still more detailed and systematic discussions, but it is a book that cannot soon be supplanted. Here is, indeed, every chance to get the "feel" of the thing. RICHARD EDWARDS University of Michigan Paolo Graziosi Palaeolithic Art, xii + 278 pp., 1251 ill. (55 in color). New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960. $35.00. This most recent and most complete of several books on paleolithic art is beautifully produced, expensive, and made up largely of illustrations, many in color-thus following the current trend in art books. It reminds us that cave art received this sumptuous treatment even before similar volumes had been devoted to the great artistic personalities, when under patronage of the Prince of Monaco the vol- umes on Altamira (1906), the Cantabrian cav- erns (1911), and others set a standard of mag- nificence of production rarely equaled, even today. And the high level of quality of the texts is even more rare in contemporary books. While these works were produced as scientific and scholarly reports on the results of field re- search, which had the good fortune to be gen- erously subsidized by a wealthy amateur ar- chaeologist, it is clear that recent publications are aimed at a larger public interested in pre- historic art mainly as a result of the discovery of the spectacular paintings in Lascaux. The present book is by Paolo Graziosi, a paleoethnologist and scholar, who has himself personally investigated and studied many of the caves. His book deals with both "mobilary" and cave art; "mobilary" means small sculp- tures and the engravings on movable objects, as distinguished from the paintings and sculp- tures actually on the cave walls. His work is thus larger in scope than Breuil's classic 400 Centuries of Cave Art (1952), which excludes the movable objects; further, Graziosi is con- cerned to a greater extent with peripheral areas outside the Franco-Cantabrian region. His ad- herence to certain recent views on the chronol- ogy of paleolithic art excludes from the present book the Spanish Levantine rock paintings, which he assigns to the succeeding mesolithic. In this view Graziosi differs from his masters, Breuil and Obermaier. He includes, however, several important recent discoveries, in partic- ular the important caverns of Rouffignac (1956) adjacent to Lascaux, and Addaura (1952) in Sicily. There are more than 1,200 illustrations in this book, most of them photographs of the ART JOURNAL XXII 1 54</page><page sequence="2">actual objects, of which 55 are in color. The reader is offered a comprehensive view of the subject with the assistance of several charts of geologic and archaeological periods, maps of the geographical distribution of the caves, and plans of the configuration of the individual caverns. A particular feature of this volume is that the author has made a special effort to represent the objects by actual photographs, substituting drawings or supplementing them with drawings only when photographs could not adequately present the object. Other draw- ings (most of them by Breuil) were employed to represent elements not visible in a photo- graph, such as the engraved contours beneath a painting. Now that photography-especially color photography-is capable of accurately recording the details and the nuances of paint- ings under the difficult conditions prevailing in the caverns, our documentation is vastly su- perior to that when we had available only Breuil's pastel drawings and sketches as a per- manent record. The usefulness of the illustra- tions in this book is increased by a thorough and precise documentation which includes the sizes of the objects and even references to spe- cialized studies made of them. The extensive bibliography is probably the most complete of any yet published in a book on the subject of paleolithic art. The approximately 200 pages of text in- cludes general remarks on paleolithic man and his environment, and is divided into two major sections on mobilary and cave art. The objects themselves are segregated according to tech- nique or media-such as bas-relief, statue, en- graving, painting, etc.-and are arranged within these categories according to their rela- tive simplicity or complexity. Although this organization assures ease in finding a desired object, it has the disadvantage of making dif- ficult any attempts to study the broad evolution of style by a comparison of objects in different media but with stylistic similarities. This method of comparison, effectively applied by Breuil, has the potentiality for unusual results because of the fact that many of the mobilary objects can be dated by the archaeological level in which they were found. By a compari- son of stylistic features with cave art, a rela- tive chronology for the paintings and wall en- gravings can be suggested. The author's stated intention of "present- ing the reader with a panoramic view" of paleolithic art has resulted in a work of en- cyclopedic scope. Since this breadth of view is enriched by a well-selected group of excel- lent photographs accompanied by a thorough documentation, a most valuable general refer- ence work is achieved. But two important as- pects of this art have been only summarily dis- cussed-the stylistic evolution of the painting and sculpture, and the meanings of the various types of figures. Comte Begouen's influential article on the magic origin of paleolithic art, for example, is only mentioned and does not appear in the otherwise excellent bibliography. And of the other scholars who have studied the meanings or the stylistic development of the art, with the exception of the psychologi- cally oriented and presently somewhat discred- ited views of Luquet, only a few-such as Breuil, Balfour, Haddon, and Marconi-are dis- cussed.
