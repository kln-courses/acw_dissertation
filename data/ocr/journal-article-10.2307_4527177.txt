<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA BY EDUARD ERKES The conception of death is originally foreign to primitive man who regards himself as being by nature immortal and thinks of death only as of a malevolent trick played on him by an inimical fellow-man or other malignant creature. That this belief which is still alive among the Australians and other very primitive tribes was pri- marily also held by the Chinese is shown by the custom of chao-hun 4 V 6, the recall of the soul, which presupposes that the soul was only thought to be provisionally absent in death1). After the insight into the permanent nature of death has been gained, it is still attributed to hostile influences exercised by men, animals or ghosts, and the more man becomes conscious of the small part played by his fellow-creatures in the effectuation of so-called natural death, the more he thinks of ghosts as of being chiefly responsible for such otherwise unaccountable occurrences. Especially avenging ghosts of murdered or otherwise wronged men and beasts are supposed to inflict death on those who have done them harm - ancient and modern Chinese lite- rature abounds with instances of this kind - but if the dead man has not been guilty of any such fault, one thinks of demons who make a special business of wronging men by smiting them with pain and 1) See Conrady, China (Pflugk-Harttungs Weltgeschichte III [1910]), p. 496.</page><page sequence="2">186 EDUARD ERKES sickness and other inexplicable misfortunes and ultimnately with death. Such demons of sickness and misfortune are already known to many primitive peoples, and the conception of a spirit especially charged with the power or, as soon as on a higher level the realm of spirits is considered to be a counterpart of the social organization of human beings, with the duty of dealing out death seems also to be pretty general among tribes that have reached a stage where the spiritual world is conceived as an organized and well-ordered sphere whose in- habitants have their special functions and duties in the same way as men have theirs. A god of death is therefore not uncommon in the pantheon even of more developed primitive peoples and almost universally found in that of cultivated nations. It would therefore be strange if we failed to find one in ancient China where the realm of spirits is otherwise so well ordered and in almost every respect a copy of the terrestrial state. And indeed there are plenty of indications that long before Yen-lo- wang made his entrance in China a heavenly minister of justice pre- siding over death and life was known to the Chinese. Some hints to a divine being dealing out death and reigning over the dead are already found in the Shi-ching. In Shi 2, 5, 6, 6 it is said of slanderers who ought to be killed: " One throws them to him who owns the north (yo pei g it). If he who owns the north does not accept them, one throws them to him who owns heaven (yo hao ' P)". "He who owns the north" is doubtless a deity presiding over the region of the dead which in China as among many other nations has of old been localized in the dark region. This results from the custom of burying the dead with their heads pointing to the north, for which this reason is given: i it 7t owr t north, the head turne nLorthwa, wz t h e To bury towards the north, the head turned northwards, was the general</page><page sequence="3">TILE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 187 custom of the three dynasties, as [the dead] go to the darkness 1)". That this custom was universal in ancient China is shown by the fact that Shang and Chou graves are regularly orientated in this way, whereas the neolithic graves still show quite different orientations 2). Even the heads of the decapitated guards of the Shang kings, which were buried separately, are always found looking to the north3). That the north was indeed regarded as the home of the dead, is shown by the name which the netherworld bears in ancient literature. It is called Yu-tu IJ g, the dark city, a name which points to its connection with the north, and is always found localized in the north, wherever its position is indicated 4). According to Shan-hai-ching 3, 9a, Yu-tu was a mountain, a thought not unnatural for a people used to bury the dead in mountain-caves and thus thinking. of them as inhabiting mountains. Huai-nan-tse calls the legendary mountain Pu- chou-shan T- JM i in the northwest the gate of the dark city 5), and the "dark island", Yu-chou j |to which Kung-kung was banished by Yao, is in all probability identical with the dark city 6). 1) Li-chi 2, 2, 1, 34 (T'an-kung, Couvreur 1, 204,). Coml. Tso-chuan XII, 26, where a person is seen in a dream lying with the head turned towards the north, which is interpreted as announcing his death. Also in Chia-vu 2, 21a/b it is said: I t * W$2 8 X 8OWN"When born, one is directed towards the south, when dying, one turns the head to the north." The first indication is not, as one might think, a rhetorical phrase inspired by inordinate love for parallel quotations but denotes a genuine custom which is still today observed, at least in northern Cbina. *The Chinese woman during parturition sits on the k'ang, reclining with her back to the rear wall of the house, so that, as the Chinese house is regularly orientated to the south, the child is indeed born with its head pointing to the south.

That the soul was conceived as residing in a region below the earth, also appears from Tso-chuan XII, 14, where it is said that j ; -t it "above is heaven, below are the ancient rulers". The expression huang-ch'iian ff "the yellow springs" which means the subterranean water as well as the transcendental realm, also shows that the latter was thought to be an underground world. To return to the Yo-pei of the Shi-ching, he probably was the ruler of such a subterranean realm of the dead and therefore himself rather an underground spirit than the polar star with which Waley tentatively. identifies him2), though it is of course not impossible that later on he became an astral divinity or was identified with a star-god. As the ode which mentions him was composed in Chou, he probably was a local divinity of northern China, for the south had another ruler of hell whom Sung Yii's Chao-hun, a poem containing much information on the mythology of ancient Ch'u, calls T'u-po i'. ' "the lord (or "the old one") of earth" and of whom in lines 39/40 it gives the following gruesome description: ±J f r L ,L . ?[ i f _ o f Jt) tiL E* A ;4 , _' * "T'u-po has nine coils, his horns are very sharp. With thick muscles and gory thumb he chases men in furious haste". So T'u-po was a half anthropomorphic, half theriomorphic deity, as the gods of ancient China generally were, probably, like others of this kind, an animal god slowly assuming human shape. Possibly, though it cannot be proved, Yo-pei had the same character, and probably he ruled the hell of northern China in the same manner as T'u-po reigned in that of Ch'u. 1) Erkes, Das Zuriickrufen der Seele (1914), p. 21; comp.

Now we know from other sources that Shang-ti was a judge of the dead, as Yen-tse says: EJ * a * X -le I &gt; 4 tf Zt tf . " Once Shang-ti pacified the good and humane ones in death, but he suppressed the inhuman ones" l). This seems first to have been the function of Shang-ti in Ch'i, Yen-tse's country, the region of the old pre-Chinese civilization of northeastern China to which Shang-ti originally belonged 2). For Lie-tse who quotes this passage from Yen- tse leaves Shang-ti out and says: "Beautiful, o, was the view the ancients had of death! The humane ones are pacified and the inhuman ones are suppressed 3)". So in southern China to whose civilization Lie-tse belonged 4), Shang-ti seems, at least in this function, to have been originally unknown, whereas in the third century B. C. he appears in Sung Yii's Chao-hun as the ruler of the heaven of Ch'u. For there it is said in 1. 36 of the wolves who infest the heaven of Ch'u and persecute the souls: ii X t P i f 4 "After having given back the sceptre (the command) to God, they may find rest". On the other hand, the role played by Shang-ti in the Shi- ching ode shows that already during the time of the Western Chou he must have acted as a god of death in the northwest, so that it is pro- bable that the Chou who were so eager to take to the cult of Shang-ti which their predecessors, the Shang, favoured 5), had accepted Shang-ti in the character of a judge of the dead as well, besides the 1) Yen-tse ch'un-ch'iu 1, 18a. 2) See Schindler in Hirth Anniversary Volume, pp. 336-357; Erkes in T'oung-pao XXXIV, 330-332. 3) Lie-tse 1, 5a (Wilhelm, p. 7). 4) The Southern character of Lie-tse's book appears from the frequent occurrence of Ch'u words in it.

It is very difficult to guess from the scanty indications which the words of the ode give what the relations between Yo-pei and Yo-hao or Shang-ti were, whether the lord of the north was regarded as the higher spirit who had the first right to judge the souls, or whether on the contrary the lord of heaven was the more exalted deity who was approached in cases which were too difficult to decide for the Yo-pei, or whether either god reigned over an independent kingdom of his own, so that a soul rejected by one of them could address itself to the other one. From the Shi-ching alone this is impossible to decide, and I am not aware of another passage which might throw light upon this question. But it is clear from the words of the song that the Yo-pei was not a king of hell and the Yo-hao not a king of heaven in the sense that the former had the bad and the latter the good souls in his care. For both gods are represented as dealing out punishments to wicked persons, so that the idea of separate transcendental regions for good and bad souls seems to have been foreign to ancient China; also the southern conceptions as depicted in the Chao-hun show nothing of this kind. Waley, as his translation "I throw them as an offering to Him of the North. If He of the North will not accept them, I throw them as an offering to Him on high" seems to imply, appears to regard the throwing of the souls as a human sacrifice offered to the Yo-pei and the Yo-hao. This is indeed very probable 2), as capital punishment in 1) For the views of the ancient Chinese on the state of the soul in general see Plath, Die Unsterblichkeitslehre der alten Chinesen, ZDMG 20 (1866), 471-484; Erkes, Die altchinesischen Jenseitsvorstellungen, Mitteillungen der Gesellschaft fur Volkerkunde 1 (1933), 1-5. 2) If this view is right, the preceding lines "Take those slanderers and throw them to panthers and tigers" must also be taken as denoting a human sacrifice offered to these animals, as indeed Waley understands them: "I take those slanderers of men and throw them as an offering to the jackals and tigers." It is true that we know nothing about human sacrifices having been offered to panthers and tigers, though the tiger at</page><page sequence="7">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 194 ancient China seems to have been regarded as a human sacrifice, but then it must be explained how a heavenly deity could be provided with human victims, as such are everywhere only offered to chthonic divinities and are closely connected with the cult of the earth-goddess and the vegetation-spirits belonging to her realm. Now the researches of Schindler have shown that Shang-ti was not always a god of heaven but originally a sinmple though important vegetation-demon, seemingly the spirit of the rice who was conceived as a dog 1). As such, he may easily have been propitiated with human sacrifices which, after his rise to the position of a god of heaven, were still offered to him where he appeared in a character akin to that which he had in his earlier divine existence, of which his connection with the dead must have been especially reminiscent. The intimate connection which seems to exist everywhere between the cult of the dead and that of the deity earth leads to the question if such a link is not to be found in Chinese religion too, so that the gods presiding over death and the dead might be regarded as later develop- ments of relations which originally existed between Mother Earth and her children 2) That this is indeed the case is first shown by the more gruesome aspect which the connection between earth and man has in most religions: in ancient China as well as elsewhere earth received least played a conspicuous part in ancient Chinese religion (see Erkes, Der Ikonogra- phische Charakter einiger Chou-bronzen, Artibus Asiae VI (1936), 111-117), but this argument ex silentio proves of course nothing. Besides, it is not at all sure that pao hu here means "panthers and tigers" in a general sense; it is conceivable that special animal-shaped deities receiving human sacrifices are meant, perhaps such as the limestone figure of a tiger-man found in a Shang grave (see Artibus Asiae VII (1937), 106-108) seems to represent. 1) Schindler 1. c. p. 356; Erkes in T'oung-pao XXXIV, 332, n. 1. 2) The female character of the deity Earth, which, curiously enough, has been denied several times, is now proved beyond reasonable doubt by the investigations of Conrady, Die chinesischen Handschriften-und sonstigen Kleinfunde Sven Hedins in Lou Lan (1920), pp. 185-189, and Karlgren, Some Fecundity Symbols in Ancient China, Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, 2 (1930), 10 sqq.</page><page sequence="8">492 EDUARD ERKES human sacrifice. That capital punishment was inflicted in such a way that the culprit was offered as a victim to the earth goddess, is shown for the Hsia time in Shu III, 2, 5 and for the Shang period in Shu IV, 1, 4, where the king addresses his warriors before battle and threatens to slay the disobedient ones before the altar of earth 1). Several passages in the Chou-li refer to the same custom. The minister of justice, Ta- se-k'ou, when a great military assembly took place, had to supervise the slaying at the altar of the earth ( A ' K ff T f' ) 2) That the sacrifice was entrusted to the minister of justice and not to a priest or to another official shows that the victims were human beings and not animals. In the same manner it is said of his assistant, the Hsiao-se-k'ou: "At a small military gathering, he supervises the slaying" (,J, Wi )3), and of the Hsiang-shi, the officers ad- minristring justice in the inner districts of the empire, it is quite clearly said that "if there is a great business (i. e. war or a great sacrifice) within the empire, they slay those who disobey orders" (;ff k * s 84J ffi j0 . no ) 4). The ritual character of this "slaying" is attested by the use of the sacrificial term lu g which is also elsewhere used for capital punishment, thus showing that this was regarded as a sacrificial act, and in conniection with the other passages it is wellnigh certain that these sacrifices took also place at the local altars of the earth-goddess. It is even possible that men killed in battle were regarded as sacrificial victims dedicated to the earth- goddess who, as results from the sacrificial customs described, was 1) I have dealt with these passages in Artibus Asiae VI (1937), 303, n. 2.

A saying quoted by Meng-tse 4, 1, 14, 1 on war "this is called to induce the earth to eat human flesh" (1t )fi + *t ij ¢ A : I) may at least point to such a conception. But not only in case of human sacrifice but quite generally death seems to have been looked upon as a return of the dead to Mother Earth, who thus for a time at least appears to have been the real goddess of death, as chthonic divinities so often are. This seems to result from the expression kuei X "to return" which is generally used in the meaning of "to die" and from which the term kuei j "demon" is stated by several ancient writers to be derived 1). So Lie-tse 1, 4a (Wilhelm, p. 4) says: l ' , ¶ o X t A f. "A demon is returned one; he has returned to his true home". Shi-tse 2, 20b gives a similar explanation: Y X , -'tfo it * - 0 XE A i ]k. "To be a demon is to have returned, therefore in times of yore the dead were called returned men". Wen-tse 4, 8b has a saying which he ascribes to Lao-tse: ~ )i t~ E ]j]r fo "Life is that which is fictitious, death is that to which one returns". But the clearest statement is made in the Chia-yii 4, 20a, where it is said: XE iI Ji ± i ftli X *. "The dead surely return to earth; thus they are called demons". This seems to imply that earth was regarded as the true home of man, the great mother from whom he was born 3) and to whose womb he must ultimately return. In a former discussion of the meaning of the ts'ung fi,, the cultic object representing the earth-goddess, I have also pointed out the possibility of the ya-hsing 1) The etymology is linguistically unassailable, as I[ *'kjaei and f- *ckjwei are phonetically almost identical (see Karlgren,, Analytic Dictionary, s. nos. 460 and 1241) and may therefore very well be related to each other. The attacks launched by de Groot (Religious System IV, 54 sqq.) against this old derivation are without any foundation. 2) On creation myths of the Chinese and related tribes showing this trait see Erkes, Spuren chinesischer Weltsch6pfungsmythen, T'oung-pao XXVIII (1931), 355-368, esp. pp. 363-367. T'oung Pao, XXXV 13 193</page><page sequence="10">194 EDUARD ERKES 9 7~, the cartouche containing the name of the deceased which frequently is to be seen on ancient bronze vessels used in ancestral service, being a representation of the womb of Mother Earth into which the bearer of the name had returned 1). Now Karlgren has shown that this ya-hsing only occurs on bronzes belonging to the Shang period ) If therefore Karlgren's identification of the ya with the ts'ung is correct, and my conclusion that the ya represents the earth-goddess with whom the dead united themselves holds good, it would seem to follow from this that Mother Earth in her quality as a goddess of the dead was peculiar to the time and civilization of the Shang. And it agrees well with this conclusion that she no longer presided over life and death during the Chou time but that a special god was entrusted with this task. Already in the Shi-ching such a demon of death seems to appear 3). In Shi 3, 3, 4, an ode attributed to the time of Chou Hsiian-wang (827-782), the expectation of death is twice (in ls. 4 and 8) expressed by the phrase )* p j fi "the great destiny is approaching". This personification seems to point to a personal being addressed as destiny, and the same impression is given by another mention of this ta ming in Shi 3, 3, 1, 7, where Wen-wang is made to say in a tirade against the Shang: yJ L -.0 "the great destiny thereby over- throws you". Now ancient Chinese mythology knows indeed a divine being whose name and function make it quite possible that it is 1) The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, Bulletin no. 3 (1931), 65/66. 2) The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, Bulletin no. 8 (1936), 21/23. 3) The idea of a personified Death, as it occurs in Europe and also among many primitive tribes, seems always to have been foreign to the Chinese. The only passage I have found which might point to such a conception occurs in 1. 151 of Ch'u Yuan's T'ien-wen where it is said of a hero not identified with certainty: A !4 d "Death may seize him". As mere linguistic metaphors of this kind hardly occur in Chinese, it looks as if shu A meant here a personal being. But the expression is so isolated and enigmatical that notbing can be made of it. No commentator has tried to explain it.</page><page sequence="11">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CtIINA 195 meant here, namely, Se-ming 'J , the Ruler of Destiny, who is mentioned several times in ancient literature in a way which shows that he was regarded as a god ruling over life and death, but more specially as a god of the dead. This results from a passage in Kuan-tse 16 (6, 4a) which reads ; ;t' T I X "There are reasons why this killing of the living hurries them towards the Se-ming" and another one in Kuan-tse 81 (24, 2a) where it is said that Mj A fiI tfi X - I "the five grains, millet and rice are the people's Se-ming", i.e. decide over their life and death. Still more significant is the following remark in Chuang-tse 18, 30b (SBE 40, 7) where Chuang-tse, talking in a dream to a skull, asks it: "If I could induce Se-ming to restore your body to life.... would you wish for this ?" The commentary explains that Se-ming is -J X1j z X "the demon Se-ming", thus apparently regarding him as belong- ing to the chthonic and not to the heavenly spirits. But in ancient literature, wherever Se-ming occurs he is usually regarded as a heavenly being. As such he appears in the Chou-li 1), where he is enumerated among the astral divinities who are sacrificed to by means of a burning pile of wood ( * '). The Shi-chi, in its iS Sb astronomical chapter T'ien-kuan 2), calls Se-ming the fourth star within the constellation named Wen-ch'ang t . Under the Han dynasty, Se-ming was sacrificed to by the shamanesses of Chin and Ching (Ch'u)3), a form of worship which makes it practically certain that the cult of Se-ming was very ancient and indigenous to northern China as well as to the south. The importance of this conclusion will become more apparent after we have gone through the two most important docu- ments referring to the cult of Se-ming, the songs Ta Se-ming and Shao 1) Chon-li 5, 10b (Ta-tsung-po, Biot I, 420). 2) Shi-chi 27, 2a (MH III, 342). 3) Shi-chi 27, 7b (MH III, 451). Chavannes, referring to the Chiu-ko dealt with below, translates "aux Se-ming", but after the commentary which calls Se-ming the fourth star of Wen-ch'ang it rather looks as if only one god were meant.</page><page sequence="12">496 EDUARD ERKES Se-ming which were sung by the shaman-girls of Ch'u when they tried to make the god descend. These songs are contained in the Chiu-ko Iu the Nine Songs, nine (really eleven) shamanistic folk-songs of ancient Ch'u which are found in the Ch'u-ts'e , the Elegies of Ch'u, among the works of Ch'ii Yuan. That they were not composed by Ch'ii but only collected and embellished by him, as they were rather crude in their original state, is explained by Wang Yi, the earliest editor and commentator of the Ch'u-ts'e, in his preface to the Chiu-ko and seems to be generally acknewledged 1). In my opinion, Ch'ii Yuian's real work consisted in translating these songs from the native language of Ch'u, which was still spoken in his time and was not a Chinese dialect but an entirely different idiom belonging to the Tai group of the Indochinese languages 2), into Chinese. That lhe adapted them a little to the taste of an educated Chinese-speaking public, especially by toning down the erotic character of the poems which was surely no less outspoken than it is everywhere in popular songs of this kind, is of course also more than probable. But this does not change the fact that they are not his productions, and this must be taken into account for the interpretation of the songs and the use of the commentaries. For the commentators, though the origin of the songs was well known to them, have, curiously enough, not always paid heed to this. Wang Yi of Han time, the Wu-ch'en of the T'ang period and the Sung commentator Hung Hsing-tsu deal witlh the Chiu-ko as if they expressed Ch'ii's own thoughts and constantly discover not only moral and political ideas but allusions to Ch'ui's own life and doings in them. Even Chu Hsi, though far more sober and critical than his predecessors, is not entirely free from this tendency. 1) Hu She-che tJ j , Tu Ch'u-ts'e -) X , Hu She wen-chang 2, 1, 144; Lu K'an-ju tt f I, Ch'u Yuan J% M (1923), p. 120 sqq.

In songs of which Ch'ii Yuan was not the author he cannot have given vent to his own feelings nor alluded to his fate and that of his country 1), and morals and politics have in shamanistic songs no place whatever. In the following trans- lation and interpretation these views of the commentaries, as being a priori impossible and untenable, will therefore be passed over in silence. The shaman songs of Ch'u were sung and danced by shamanesses, young and beautiful girls who were gaudily dressed and well per- fumed 2) and who enticed the god they addressed by seductive dances and songs, until they felt in their ecstasy that he had descended and united himself with them. Hu She-che (l. c. p. 144) therefore quite aptly calls the Chiu-ko - "tdancing songs of the popular religion". The fifth of the Nine Songs, called Ta Se-ming 71W Q, is addressed to the god of destiny whom Wang Yi in an additional note identifies with the Se-ming mentioned in the passage of the Chou-li given above. The song runs thus 3): 1) The same view is given by Hu She-che, 1. c. p. 146. 2) The toilet of a shaman-girl is described in Chiu-ko 2 (Yun-chung chun * 41 : ), The passage has been translated by Schindler, Das Priestertum im alten China, (1919), p. 33. 3) The Chiu-ko were translated, in 1852, together with the Li-sao by A. Pfizmayer. Das Li-sao und die Neun Gesinge, Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissen- schaften in Wien, phil.-hist. Klasse, vol. 3, pp. 161-188. Pfizmaier translation is remarkably good, especially if it is taken into account that he had to work quite alone, without Chinese assistance and with a very insufficient scientific apparatus. His trans- lation of the Li-sao is, in my opinion, materially and formally still the best existing. But there are of course a number of errors in it as well as in that of the Chiu-ko, and the latter is seriously marred by being entirely based on the interpretation given by the commentaries which the old translator was of course unable to control. So it gives only very little aid towards their understanding.</page><page sequence="14">198 EDUARD ERKES g J 1 X3 a"Wide I1) open the gate of heaven. e E P E IT 3 Slowly i) I mount the dark clouds + N 1 I order the whirlwind to go before me, I 70 f j " f I let the rainstorm clear the way" 3). if X e - l-; The prince wheels around, and thus he descends 4).

See Maspero, Le'gendes mythologiques dans le Chou king (Journal Asia- tique 1924), pp. 9 and 17. 6) Chu Hsi: "'Prince' and 'you' both refer to the spirit. 'Prince' is respectful and 'you' intimate. It means: She beholds the spirit, then he descends and follows her. Thus she praises the fullness of his awful power. All the people within the nine provinces are like this. Why is the destiny of life and death concentrated in herself ?" The meaning is thus that the shamaness beholds the god descending upon her, so that she herself is in rapture carried past the sun-tree into the realm of the spirits. She wonders why she alone among all men is distinguished by the union with the god who rules over life and death. 7) Wang Yi: "As master of the Yin he kills. As master of the Yang he gives life. Se-ming always mounts the clear atmosphere of heaven and directs the destiny of everybody's life and death." Hung Hsing-tsu point to the descriptions which Chuang-tse (like other Taoist writers) gives of Taoist saints driving in meditation through heaven and earth. The comparison is indeed to the point, as the same state of ecstasv is here experienced by the shamaness.</page><page sequence="15">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 199 71 I S 8 I and the prince, we are in equal haste 1). g Zjt At e ;t J:)t I lead the god along to the nine ridges 2).

Doubtless Se-ming himself is meant. The "nine ridges" are explained as the nine holy mountains of the provinces of ancient China. The meaning is therefore probably: The girl wants to roam with her heavenly lover through the whole world. 3) ' i4 lu-li is not explained by the commentaries. By the T'se-yiian s. v. it is said to signify % i X "irregular" orwra * "confused" Both meanings are not very appropriate; one would rather think lu-li to be an onomatopoetic expression denoting the tinkling of the girdle pendants, perhaps a loanword from the old language of Ch'u, such as seem to occur rather frequently in the Ch'u-ts'e. 4) These lines evidently describe the intercourse of the shamaness with the god. Probably they were far more outspoken in the original and somewhat toned down and embellished by Ch'ii Yuan. 5) The yao-hua is explained as the hemp-flower (ma-bua 6$,tL v ). The meaning of the hemp is not explained. Perhaps it served as a narcotic in helping to produce the trance of the shamaness. The expression "spirit hemp" might also point to this. See below. 6) 7 is explained by Wang Yi as "hidden" ( , by Hung-Hsing-tsu as" far of" ( j,). As this is the usual meaning of the term, Hung is probably right. 7) 'j is explained as meaning "slowly" (Wang Yi 9, Chu Hsi: Chu Hsi adds: "After the spirit has left, she still thinks of him". The last lines seem to depict the girl's awakening from the trance; she feels old and exhausted and thinks that the god has left her because she is no longer attractive. She thinks of a means to get him back, and probably the hemp which produces intoxication and leads to the trance appears to her as suitable for this purpose.</page><page sequence="16">200 EDUARD ERKES R "t e " THe mounts the dragon; the carriage rolls off').

That it was an independent male god 1) j I the sound of a carriage. Wang Yi points to Shi 1, 11, 1, 1, where the same expression is now written D4j.

Comp. the stories of lovers' grave-trees which, as in the saga of Tristan and Iseult, twisted their stems and branches together (de Groot, Religious System II, 471/72). 4) Chu Hsi: "After the spirit has departed and is no longer staying with her, she waits for him full of longing and with sorrowful mind". - It looks as if the shamaness experienced the sensations of a person awakening from the state of having been drugged, for ecstasy merely produced by psychic means very seldom leads to such griveous results but usuially gives a feeling of refreshment and happiness. This may add to the probability that in Ch'u drugs like hemp were used to produce the ecstatic trance. 5) a (lit. to fail, to grieve) is explained by the commentaries as mneaning 3 "to cease". Wang Yi: "I wish that I could act well and that it remained always with- out having to cease. 6) Chu Hsi: "Unfailing she keeps to her thoughts and doings and does not relax". I. e. she will always try to produce the same ecstatic trance again, as persons accus- tomed to shamanistic experience cannot live without them.</page><page sequence="17">TIIE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 201 and not a female consort of the Great Se-ming, such as sometimes appear in European mythologies, becomes evident from the song. In the whole of ancient literature there seems to exist but one allusion to the Shao Se-ming. It is found in the Li-chi ') where as the first of the ch'i-se -t fE,, the seven sacrifices offered to the more important minor spirits, that to the Se-ming is mentioned. According to the commentary of K'ung Ying-ta 2), this Se-miing is not identical with the Se-ming of heaven, )X z .J 0j, but a minor deity entrusted with similar functions. Chu Hsi remarks in his additional note on the Ta Se-ming that the Great Se-ming is the star Shang-t'ai L tl of the constel- lation San-t'ai - j 3), and the Little Se-ming the fourth star of the constellation ealled Wen-ch'ang t t. Perhaps Ta Se-ming and Shao Se-ming were originally two local divinities who could not be entirely identified with each other and became therefore charged with slightly different functions. Be this as it may, at all events they were, in Ch'u at least, treated and invoked in a very similar manner, as appears from the Shao Se-ming which was also sung by ecstatic shaman-girls and reads as follows: "The autumn-orchid, the mi-wu 4)!

The expressions "green twigs" and "purple stalks" seem to contain erotic allusions, just as the "green leaves" and "white branches" of the second line may have a double meaning. Green is the colour of youth, comp. the expression lii-nii ; ~j "young girls", and by the white branches of the green-leaved plants the white arms of the girls may be understood. Hung Hsing:tsu seems to think of this line as alluding to Shi 1, 5, 1, 3: : 1 j1ffi "the green bamboo is luxuriant". 3) Chu Hsi: "The beautiful girls crowd into the hall, but Se-ming only glances at me, and by exchanging looks our love is completed". - The dramatic character of the Shao Se-ming which is really a love-duet between the god and his priestess has already been recognized by Conrady (see Schindler, Das Priestertum im alten China, p. 28, n. 6), but his interpretation is at present unfortunately inaccessible to me. 4) This expression occurs again in Li-sao, Str. 91. 5) She beholds the god again, but only for an instant. 202</page><page sequence="19">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 9 7g ^/ ~' p The night he passes within the god's') realm. .'~ X - J e j ~ Why does my prince tarry on the edge of the clouds? jt * X }t P -i - [With you I ramble at the nine rivers, 8f l ff/ 7i SC i , The rushing wind reaches the water and raises the waves]2).

[This title, however, was only conferred in A.D. 1317; cf. Dore, Recherches, t. VI, p. 40. J. J. L. D.]. 2) These two lines on which Wang Yi does not comment are missing in old editions and are, according to Hung Hsing-tsu and Chu-Hsi, interpolated from the Ho-po ngJ I (Chiu-ko 8), where they occur. 3) Here the Se-ming again begins to speak, as Chu Hsi remarks. The Hsien pond is mentioned by Ch'ii Yuan in the Li-sao, str. 50, and by Huai-nan-tse 3, 18a in an old sun-hymn describing the daily journey of the sun-goddes Hsi-ho (translated by Wilhelm, Lia Dsi, p. 135) who is said there to bathe in the Hsien-ch'i. In Yiian-yu, 1. 76, hsien-ch'i is the title of a piece of music; comp. Biallas in Asia Major 7 (1931). 229/30. Yang-ngo "the southern bank" may also be translated by "bank of the sun"; it is probably that bank of the pond on which the sun goddes dries herself after the bath. Hung Hsing-tsu points to Yian-yu 1. 50: "In the morning I dried my body in the nine suns. 4) After having induced the god to descend, the shamaness herself seems to set up a little love-teasing by making him wait. 5) These two lines seem again to be words of the shamaness who admires the god's equipment and mounts his carriage. According to Wang Yi, the canopy of the god's carriage 203</page><page sequence="20">204 EDUARD ERKES P" /iIS' jo it 'I seize the long sword and embrace the young beauty 1). g g i E '4+ A .~ liE You alone are fit [for me], of all the people you are the right one!" The purely shamanistic character of the cult of Se-ming which shows in these songs whose strong erotic tinge has not been effaced even by the alterations probably made by Ch'ii Yuan, testifies to the antiquity of the god and his worship. But it is another question whether Se-ming always possessed the astral character which the Shi-chi assigns to him. It is at all events rather curious that he is not mentioned in the astro- nomical chapter 3 (T'ien-wen-hsiin) of HIuai-nan-tse, so his conception as a star seems at least not to have been general. That the commentary of Chuang-tse calls him a kuei also points to his having originally been a terrestrial deity, though as a star-god and a god of darkness he might have had telluric connections, just as the moon is regarded as a terres- trial divinity. This would be an older conception than that which appears from the Chiu-ko, for there he is described as a Yang, i.e. a solar spirit and marked by his peacock and kingfisher ornaments as a god belonging to the solar realm, as these birds are solar symbols 2) We shall later return to this question. A curious description of Se-ming is given in the comrnentary on a line in Chang Heng's f j Se hsiian-fu F, I% ,,whichiscon- tained in the Wen-hsiian, ch. 15, and is also found in Chang Heng's is made of peacocks' tails and his banner of kingfisher feathers. Peacock and kingfisher are in China birds of good omen. In the seventh of the Chiu-ko, the Tung-chiin, the shamaness is described as dancing a kingfisher dance (the passage is translated by Schindler Das Priestertum im alten China, p. 33). Comets are evil portents (Chu Hsi). Together with them he brushes the evil away (Wang Yi). 1) The two last lines are again words of the Se-ming. He calls the shamaness I t yu-ngai "tender artemisia", a term of endearment for young females. Hung Hsing-tsu points to the corresponding expression 4^ t shao-ngai "little artemisia" in Meng-tse 5, 1, 1, 5. 2) For the kingfisher, see Schindler, Das Priestertum im alten China, p. 33, n. 9.</page><page sequence="21">TI1E GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA biography in the Hou Han-shu. It reads: fE '4 ffij / , ff] TN M i 11J "*Death and life are not ordered, even Se-ming cannot distinguish them" 1). The commentary of the Hou Han-shu says: , yt a V. "Se-ming is the name of a spirit, the superior of the destroyers. He measures eight feet, has a small nose, is far-sighted, has much moustache and is lean". These curious details look exactly like the description of a local divinity beheld in the ecstatic visions of shamanesses. The indication that even Se-ming is unable to keep life and death asunder is very interesting as it shows that the god of destiny is himself subject to fate and was, at least in the Han time, only regarded as the executor of a destiny which man brings about by his own doings. Probably this conception is far older, for the idea that man himself is responsible for his fate is found throughout the whole of ancient literature 2). 1) Wen-hsiian 15, 6a; Hou Han-shu 89, 9a. 2) To give some examples of this: In Shi 3, 3, 10, 3 it is said 1L I I X .

"If it is in the marrow, even Se-ming could do nothing against it" 1). How Se-ming controls the fate which men bring down upon them- selves is shown in an interesting passage of the Chie-chie 'f " Ex- planation", a mystical commentary on Lao-tse, first mentioned in the Sui catalogue but possibly older, numerous fragments of which have been preserved-). The Chie-chie understands the sentence in Lao-tse ch. 74: " A t 9 TX as meaning: "There is always the Se- sha who kills", and explains this as follows: "....Who kills men, commits a Yin crime. Then the Se-yin tJ R announces this to high Heaven. He examines the spiritual and the animal souls. If maii has evil words, then the Se-sha announces them to the Se-ming. The Se- ming takes them down. When the sins are full, he kills". According to this, the Se-sha "Ruler of Killing" is a subordinate of the Se-ming, and the Se-yin "Ruler of Darkness" a subordinate of heaven who inform their masters of the sins of men. Of course it is quite uncertain if the interpretation of the term Se-sha as used by Lao-tse is correct, though it is not impossible - mythological allusions in Lao-tse seem to be far more numerous than is generally supposed man himself completes it". Shuo-yuan 16, 7b: l) 4 I-[ 1 JLkU 4P LU t j- A X * g , L C "Misfortune and happiness do not rise out of the earth, nor do they come down from heaven: you produce them yourself". But the clearest statemient is made in Chung-yung 1, 1: JX- "The destiny of heaven is called the human character" which corresponds exactly to the ;Oog XvOp6rco m'1oy of Herakleitos. 1) Shi-chi 105, 3b. Hubotter in his translation of the biography (Beruihmte chine- sische Arzte, Archiv zur Geschichte der Medizin VII [1914]), has misunderstood the term and translates (p. 127): "selbst wenn es den Kopf kosten sollte". 2) See my translation "Ein mvstischer Kommentar zu Lao-tse" in Zeitschrift far Missionskunde und Religionswissenschaft 50 (1935), 197-219. For the passage in question, see p. 215.</page><page sequence="23">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA 207 but certainly the author of the Chie-chie has recounted mythological details which were current in his own time. That similar beliefs as to the Se-ming's keeping accounts were known in the Han time is shown by a saying of Tung-fang So quoted in the commentary of the above- mentioned Se-hsiian-fu in Wen-hsiian 15, 6a which says: A 6 z 0iIJ SE 3* " X The spirit Se-ming controls the list of the demons". Perhaps the relation in which Se-ming stands to heaven and its ming may help us to come nearer to the origin of this deity. As we have seen, the real originator of fate is neither Se-ming nor heaven but man himself. In spite of this insight, there seems always to have been something uncanny and inexplicable about fate, which also appears from the fact that it belonged to the topics of which K'ung-tse but seldom spoke 1), and so it seems never to have become wholly separated from the conceptions of mysticism - just as in European philosophy - and thereby always retained something of a primitive shamanistic notion. Now it is very interesting that Ming, Destiny, itself appears as a personal deity in Lie-tse 6, la (Wilhelm, pp. 64/65), where it converses whith Li )J, Force, which is equally personified, on their mutual relations. Ming demon- strates to Force that it is the more potent divinity, but is unable to explain why this is the case. It ends the discourse by saying: "As I am called Destiny, how could I govern anything? I push on the straight and leave alone the crooked. Long life and early death, failure and success, honour and humiliation, wealth and poverty, they all come of themselves. How could I know them, how could I know them?" So even the T'ien-ming itself is powerless against the doings of man - it merely takes account of them, in the same manner as 1) Lun-yu 9, 1.</page><page sequence="24">208 EDUARD ERKES the Se-ming. But the most interesting fact which this passage of l,ie-tse discloses is that Destiny was also regarded as a personal divinity -- probably it was, like many other personified concep- tions appearing in Taoist literature, a hypostasised divine quality, a faculty of T'ien which was perceived in the visions of shamans as a personal being and then represented as such in art and litera- ture, which is generally the origin of iconography. Now the question is, cat this personified Ming be the same as the Ta-ming of the Shi-ching and identical with the deity Se-ming, or rather, may the conception of a ruler of destiny have developed out of that of a personified quality of heaven? As far as I can see, ancient literature gives no means to prove this directly, but nevertheless it seems not improbable, as this assumption appears to be suitable for solving some difficulties which the figure of Se-ming presents. On the one hand, the conception of a ruler of destiny and a heavenly accountant of the doings of men looks comparatively late; on the other, the shamanastic cults devoted to the Se-ming in Ch'u and Chin prove the god's high antiquity. The only way to reconcile these divergent indications seems to me the assumption that things coming from various sources were blended together in the conception of Se-ming. As we have seen, the earth-goddess seems to have been the goddess of death in eastern China during the Shang time. In ancient Ch'i, Shang-ti appears as the god of the dead, and in the north- west, the Yo-pei had the same function. For Chin and Ch'u, the cult of Se-ming is attested as old. Now chthonic divinities are associated with a period of motherright, heavenly gods with a patriarchal one. In China, we have everywhere traces of an old period of motherright which gave way to fatherrig,ht, as it seems, towards the end of the Shang period 1). So it is probable that at 1) Erkes, Der Primat des Weibes im alten China, Sinica 10 (193a), 166-176.</page><page sequence="25">THE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA '209 this time the goddess of earth transferred some of her ruling qualities to Shang-ti who, as the inscription bones show, played a prominent part in the religion of the later Shang time. So he probably took to himself also the function of presiding over the realm of the dead and kept it in the northeast, in Ch'i, of whose pantheon he became the highest god. In central China, the ancient territory of the Hsia whose chief god had always been Heaven, Heaven seems to have had this prerogative, but as Heaven had so many functions and the people everywhere prefer heavenly specia- lists for transcenidental troubles as well as for earthly ones, his divine quality, the ming, destiny or fate, was hypostasised as Ta- ming and became, as a subordinate deity, the name of a ruler of the destiny of heaven, a Se-ming. This transformation took place very early, and so the cult of Se-ming was practised in Chin, the ancient territory of Hsia civilization, by shamanesses, the represen- tatives of the earliest cults. This cult of Se-ining spread to the south, where it probably blended with that of a native god of death. So in the south, we have two Se-mings regarded as astral deities. Besides, as ancient Ch'u liad close relations with the Shang territory and the north- eastern culture, we find Shang-ti ruling the heaven of Ch'u. On the other hand, the cult of Shang-ti was readily taken up in the north-west by the representatives of the Chou culture who were so strongly inifluenced by the civilization of Hsia. Here a native god of the dead, the Yo-pei, ruler of the north, reigned over the netherworld of the Chou which was, like that of most Siberian and other northern peoples, situated in the cold and dark region. But this conception was early mixed up with that of the Se-miing, and so we find Se-ming in the Chou-li as a heavenly deity. Now when the Chou had conquered China, they assimilated themselves to Shang civilization and took over the beliefs of the T'ouncr Pao, XXXV 14</page><page sequence="26">210 EDUARD ERKES, TIIE GOD OF DEATH IN ANCIENT CHINA Shang which the Shang priests tried to blend with those the Chou had brought with them or already acquired from the Hsia civili- zation which they had known for long. So during the Chou period we find Shang-ti together with Se-ming as rulers of the dead, the Yo-hao, Lord of Heaven, besides Yo-pei, the Ruler of the North, and even in Ch'i, the stronghold of the Shang-ti belief, Kuan-tse mentions Se-ming as ruling destiny, just as *in Ch'u, where the cult of Se-ming seems to have been especially popular, Shang-ti was nevertheless regarded as the ruler of the fate of men in heaven. A real blending of these conceptions inever seems to have taken place, and this shows that in all probability they were of different local and temporal origins. This sketch of the possible development of the conception and cult of the Se-ming is, of course, mainly hypothetical and must needs be so, until perhaps new discoveries of bone or bronze in- scriptions relating to the fate of the dead will allow to prove it more closely. But it seems to me that it covers all the known facts, and so it may stand for what it is worth until better founded explanations will supersede it and give us a deeper insight into the original nature of the god of death.</page></plain_text>
