<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Derivative Devil THE DEVIL'S SHARE. By Denis de Rougemont. Pantheon. $2.50 DENIS de Rougemont's Devil is designed to startle, but many readers will meet him with a pleased and placid recognition. They will know him not from the Bible or Baudelaire-although Rougemont insists on his Biblical origin and seems to acknowledge Baudelaire as the modern master of those that know the Devil-and not from either folklore or theology, or from the Inferno or Paradise Lost or Faust-they will re- member 'him as the Devil of The Brothers Karamazov and Man and Su- perman. In Dostoievsky he is the shabby-genteel fellow, "not so much good-natured as accommodating," who discusses with Ivan the destruc- tion of the idea of God, the creation of the man-God and the joyous new morality of despair that these events will produce. He is also, of course, the genius of the Grand Inquisitor of Ivan's poem; in this character he recoups an old defeat, for he represents the mystique of the modern state, ruling mankind by the very powers which had been offered in temptation to Christ and by Christ refused, the "bread" and the "mystery, miracle and authority," the means of a "happiness" which requires in exchange nothing but the painful freedom that had been Christ's only power and only promise. In Shaw this same Devil shows himself in his aspect of the average, sensual and sentimental-he says natural-man who presides over the kingdom where "nothing is real." . . . Hell is the home of the uareal and the seekers for happiness. It is the only refuge from heaven which, as I can tell you [Don Juan is speaking], is the home of the masters of reality, and from earth, which is the home of the slaves of reality. [Here in hell] you call your appearance beauty, your</page><page sequence="2">498 KENYON REVIEW emotions love, your sentiments heroism, your aspirations virtue, just as you did on earth; but here there are no hard facts to contradict you, no ironic contrast of your needs with your pretensions, no human comedy, nothing but a perpetual romance, a universal melodrama. If we have these two works in mind, we cannot feel that Rougemont advances modern diabology very far or carries it in any new direction. But "The Grand Inquisitor" is perhaps the greatest moral-political docu- ment of our time and Act III of Man and Superman is at least one of the greatest: a new book about the Devil they share deserves a welcome. I am glad Rougemont wrote his book. I hope it will be read, for, where it succeeds, it brings acutely into question a great many of the liberal-pro- gressive assumptions we all too blandly accept. Its urbane bravura makes lively reading-"I like to write only dangerous books," says Rougemont, and that will give the tone of irony, paradox and hyperbole, perhaps by now a little worn from long Continental use but still in pretty fair condi- tion. My own pleasure in the book was frequent and so was my agreement with it. I found, nevertheless, that it produced in me a recurrent weari- ness and depression. By chance a couplet of Emily Dickinson's came my way to explain this enervation as well as anything could: Believing where you don't believe Does not exhilarate. To rid the world of the evils it discovers and denounces, Rougemont's book proposes a universe seen religiously, anthropomorphically and with the imagination of morality rather than with the imagination of science. This does not repel me-I find that I am always willing to entertain an anthropormorphic view of the world. Perhaps we all are, more than we think. It is especially easy if you have constant dealings with literature. Homer, Dante and Milton are the regular thing; it is Spinoza who makes us boggle. But Rougemont's anthropomorphism is not, as philosophers and political commentators like to say, viable. It has no potentiality of life because the imagination by which it is offered to us is factitious. It is not a question of "sincerity." Rougemont believes, but he believes where he doesn't believe. Hence the lack of exhilaration I have mentioned. Rougemont implies that modern belief must rest on a power of willed imagination and I accept this assumption in finding his own imagination factitious. It is his management of his Devil that first suggests the judg- ment. Rougemont scolds modernity because it has ceased to believe in the Devil-he tells us, in that dashing way of his, that it is proof of the Devil's existence that we no longer believe in him. But at the same time,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REV I EWS 499 he assures us that his book is not an effort to "demonstrate" the Devil. "It is no more than an attempt to interpret certain shortcomings of our time by referring them to the activity of the only being to whom these can give cause for'rejoicing." In short, the Devil, as he tells us, is a myth. He tells us that myth makes an effective mode of thought, that we lose much when we lose the ability to use it. We agree at once. But we re- mark a large difference between myth in what we may call its purity, when it is literally or almost literally believed, and myth when it is used in the modern way of a poetical or rhetorical device, as for example, the Devil of Wyndham Lewis's The Childermass or the Devil of C. S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters, which do not confuse the issue, because they do not raise it, of the Devil's real or mythical existence. But Rouge- mont calls his myth a myth and then does what cannot be done with a modern myth, he insists on it. He makes the fatal error-C. S. Lewis, also a practitioner of Christian homiletics, carefully avoids it-of reck- lessly involving his mythical devil with a plea for religious belief, rec- ognizing no distinction between the kind of credence we give a modern myth-the willing (and even, in this case, slightly facetious) suspension of disbelief-and the kind of belief we must presumably give to religion. In making my judgment of the quality of Rougemont's imagination I do not compare it with the mind that exists by implicit or literal belief, the mind of, say, a primitive Christian or even of a St. Augustine. That would be neither fair nor illuminating. But Newman was a modern man who did not believe in a literal way, and knew it. He was aware of the value, the pleasure and the ways of achieving belief, what we would call its "psychology." It is a dangerous awareness, but Newman faced it. In modern belief there is always the pragmatic or instrumental considera- tion; here is Newman on that: "In matters of religion, he [Keble] seemed to say, it is not merely probability which makes us intellectually certain, but the probability as it is put to account by faith and love." Newman, I am trying to suggest, is always at the outward bounds of belief, as Rouge- mont is, yet he is also always at its center, as Rougemont never is. Rouge- mont's anthropomorphism is but an attitude; Newman's remarks on the "mystical or sacramental principle . . . the various Economies and Dis- pensations of the Eternal" by which "the exterior world, physical and historical, was but the outward manifestation of realities greater than it- self," is a felt reality. Rougemont plays elaborately with his Devil and makes the best of two mental systems. Newman tells us of his belief in</page><page sequence="4">500 KENYON REV I EW a middle race of spirits, daimonia, "partially fallen, capricious, wayward; noble or crafty, benevolent or malicious, as the case might be," who have charge of races, nations and classes of men; their influence accounts for the difference between the actions of bodies politic and the individuals who compose them; he adds, "My preference of the Personal to the Ab- stract would naturally lead me to this view," and we know at once the precise weight of the idea. That is why, whatever our own views, we can always read the Apologia with instruction-and exhilaration. Even more grossly than in his bad strategy of the Devil, the quality of Rougemont's religious imagination shows in his moments of elo- quence or poetry. I do not know what we can call the meditation on the fall of Paris except bathos. That is the only word that can suggest at once the sincerity and the attitudinizing. Rougemont tells us that the Devil manifests himself in bad and facile art-what are we to make of the other worldly alliances of a man who gives us this as the last paragraphs of a concluding chapter called "Blue Sky"? I oppose to [the devilj the blue sky of heaven. The blue skies that I have loved. The blue sky of the Ile de France, the sweetness of art and of the ages, and the smile of a woman whose love is faithful and gay. The blue sky of Manhattan, bursting like an inexorable joy between the silver verticalities of its skyscrapers. The blue sky of the Alps, shimmering with dazzling black, at noon, on the face of the glaciers. * * * It is said that the Demon lokves the hour of midnight. Ah! Let us turn, with faces uplifted, toward the universal strength and deep peace of for- giveness, and let us plunge into the vastnesses of the hard and burning purity, the blue of heaven in the heart of the day. When that was written, the imps who have charge of the corruption of prose rejoiced in hideous glee. Ultimately the quality of Rougemont's belief touches his intelligence. If Rougemont adds anything beside timeliness and homiletic fervor to the Dostoievsky-Shaw Devil, it is by the intelligence of his particular ob- servations, some of which are remarkably acute. For example, he com- ments on how many of the errors of the modern mind spring from the peculiarly modern desire for utopian innocence. In effect, this has been said before-the attack on the ethical theory of liberal-progressivism is usually directed at the assumption of man's natural goodness and at the tendency to reduce individual responsibility; the statement of our impulse to innocence does no more than summarize these tendencies. But it rec- ommends itself as anterior to both and more suggestive than either. In- deed, it is possible and it might be useful to conceive of a history of</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REV I EWS 501 modern culture as man's effort to be good by fiat. Our popular art, from Saroyan or Steinbeck or Harvey down, is devoted to fostering the sense of freedom from guilt. PM will sell you daily innocence for a nickel; every class has as the spring of its action the belief in its own abused goodness. This is the great modern fact, and we follow Rougemont with pleasure as he points out its consequences to democracy, reminding us how we have made Hitler's wickedness serve as the precious assurance of our own virtue; we follow him too when our lies do not so much consist in departure from the truth as in destruction of the standard of truth, for where there is no standard we are all innocent; or when he tells us that we seek to preserve our innocence by dissolution of the personality in a culture of crowds and mass emotions-by disguising the I as "We," he says, we contrive to avoid responsibility: "in order that there may no longer be any responsibility, there must no longer be anyone." And we follow him too when, as an intimate moralist, he tells us how, in the private life, we can "set in motion the complicated mechanisms . . . of a torn conscience, and of the desire to destroy oneself at last in order to make oneself innocent !" Not new but true-we have learned from Freud how devious are the devices of the unconscious. Presumably Rougemont has also learned from Freud. But he has undertaken to defy rationalism and science and he is not above exploiting the ready grin at psychoan- alysis,, even while he borrows from it, by defining psychoanalysis as "an attempt to reduce sin and Evil to subjective mechanisms, which a doctor will be able to control." C. G. Wallis, who reviewed the French version of The Devil's Share in these pages (Winter, 1944), calls Rougemont's remarks on Freud "a fallacious piece of casuistry" which lays its author "open catastrophically to the charge of theological obsurantism." I cannot improve on his formu- lation: If we look at psychoanalysis theologically, then is not its proper function to heal the false feelings of guilt, which are induced by a neurotic super- ego-a different thing from the moral conscience even if it is related to it -and which have their source in childhood events which occurred before the age of reason in which the conscience could function properly? For if a man is obsessed with a false guilt, it is difficult for him to recognize his real responsibilities. The moral guilt of a neurotic would lie in malingering in his neurosis . . . . Psychoanalysis should be conceived as a special dis- cipline of self-knowledge; and in order to make a moral choice a man must know his desires. . . . Satan is also the Spirit that Denies, and his works should be evident in a guilt-neurosis as well as in a loss of moral respon- sibility.</page><page sequence="6">502 KENYON REVIEW Rougemont's perversion of Freud is a failure of intelligence. It sug- gests something further. I do not mean a failure of intellectual good will, although it has that appearance. It suggests a failure of the moral imag- ination. As a celebrant of the moral life, Rougemont is suave and be- guiling; but he talks about it like a public person, all external; with a sense of its drama-he is one of those whom the word tragedy charms too much-but not of its pain; with no sense of its contradictions, of the human being in growth and in life. In short, he speaks of it with no sense of its reality. LIONEL TRILLING</page></plain_text>
