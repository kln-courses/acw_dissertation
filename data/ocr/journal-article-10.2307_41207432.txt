<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradoxical Puritans The Puritan Origins of the American Self. By Sacvan Bercouitch. Tale University Press. $15. Reviewed by Cushing Strout In the nineteenth century even a French Catholic like Tocqueville and a Jewish ra- tionalist like Freud admired the Puritans. By the 1920s, however, Puritanism for most American intellectuals had become a syn- onym for prudishness and prohibition. In the 1940s a nucleus of Harvard scholars, most notably Perry Miller, rediscovered American Puritans not only with empathy but with some sense of their pertinence to the history that came after them. Miller's students have kept them alive as scholarly topics, despite a climate in which na√Øve notions of liberation from all repressions are clamorously per- vasive among "the herd of independent minds." Sacvan Bercovitch has entered the lists with an essay that I, as a student of Miller's, think he would have relished - not least for its audacity in calling Cotton Ma- ther, of all people, "the first major writer" to infuse the term "American" with "the imagi- native power it has carried ever since." Bercovitch shares Miller's passionate inter- est in the issue of national identity. Like him, he is unapologetically engaged in doing in- tellectual history at a time when that is very unfashionable in the historical profession, now bemused with social, economic, and eth- nic topics. (One of Miller's most productive O CUSHING STROUT is Ernest I. White Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters at Cor- nell University. His latest book is The New Heavens and New Earth: Political Religion in America, and he is currently writing a critical review of psycho- history in American studies. students, Edmund S. Morgan of Yale, has moved out of Puritan territory into an eco- nomic and demographic historiography about the origins of American slavery.) Like Miller at Harvard, Bercovitch at Columbia teaches literature, and both have been fasci- nated by the romantics. This book is a densely written and impres- sively erudite elaboration of a single Puritan text and method. Cotton Mather's "The Life of John Winthrop," from his Magnalia Christi Americana; or, The Ecclesiastical History of New England ', is the text. The method is the "her- meneutical mode connecting the Old Testa- ment to the New in terms of the life of Jesus," and by figurai extension, or typology, merg- ing the believer's life with the events of scrip- tural history. The essential notion of the type, distinguishing it from the modern idea of the symbol, as Erich Auerbach first observed, is that it relates earlier and later historical events in terms of promise and fulfillment rather than through the linkage of causality. In this way Old Testament events fore- shadow New Testament ones that fulfill them, and the whole process is interpreted, as Bercovitch says, "through a sacred design that is prior to, and independent of, the self." Perry Miller had dealt with this subject only in connection with Roger Williams, whom he thought eccentric in his typological interest. Bercovitch implicitly revises Miller by put- ting typology at the center of the mainstream of Puritan thought. This subject is not simple, but I think Ber- covitch makes it seem excessively thorny by his indulgence in a forbidding technical vo- cabulary: exemplum fidei, littera-historia, prot- evangelium, sola scriptum, auto-machia, micro- christus, soteriology. Although it reflects his grasp, unusual in an Americanist, of the world of Renaissance scholarship, perhaps more courtesy to the reader would have en- abled him to find terms more accessible to contemporaries. His taste for Latinisms may distract readers from his ideas. A crucial one is his distinction between two providential histories - one in which secular events are featured, although they are ulti- mately controlled by God; the other in which the historical individual, community, and events are located within a sacred scheme of salvation. In his homage to Winthrop as an 602</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS American Nehemiah, Mather, the Puritan biographer, characteristically conflated the two ideas, connecting the governor with "a terrestrial and a supernal country." As the representative American, he stands "at once for citizen and saint, state and church, New England and ecclesiastical history, res Ameri- cana and res Christi." For Bercovitch this rhetorical strategy of Mather's, which makes America a prophetic extension of New England, is important his- torically: it contributes to our spiritualized "anthropomorphic nationalism" that links up millennial expectations of redemption with a national destiny, as other scholars (for example, Ernest L. Tuveson, not cited here) have demonstrated. The point gains force if comparative analysis can show the absence of this cast of mind in other countries. Ber- covitch has to meet the challenge posed by English political religion in the Puritan revo- lution, which applied Israel's story to Eng- land as analogy, precedent, and moral ex- ample. He concedes that John Foxe's Book of Mar- tyrs "brought spiritual and chronicle biog- raphy together in the framework of Eng- lish history" and so "rendered 'England' a metaphor for the confluence of redemptive and providential history." He goes even fur- ther and admits that the Magnalia was "an anachronism on the day of its publication," whereas the Book of Martyrs became "by royal decree a companion volume to the Bible in every parish church," remaining the national epic for half a century. Yet Bercovitch 's book depends upon his belief that Mather's vision "remains one of the most powerful unifying elements of the culture," surviving down through the classic age of American literature and beyond. In provocative footnotes, Ber- covitch pursues his theme obliquely to find quarry in Henry Adams, Fitzgerald, Mailer, and Warren. How is this paradox to be ex- plained? The vision survived whether or not Ameri- cans had ever heard of the Magnalia, he ar- gues, because they shared Harriet Beecher Stowe's millennial view of American history, first adumbrated in Mather's work as some- thing "both more comprehensive and more privileged than what Foxe meant by national election." This crucial distinction is an elu- sive one, and Bercovitch defines it finally as the narrow difference between "a temporary conjunction of sainthood and nationality" in the English case and, in the American one, a "fusion" of the two categories in an "unfold- ing pattern of types and antitypes, itself a prophecy to be fulfilled." The New England version seems affiliated appropriately to the Bay Colony's polity in which church and state overlapped in the re- striction of citizenship to sainthood status. But what is missing is an exploration of how such a vision survived the coming of the Enlight- enment in good enough health to flourish again, as he claims it did, in the classic writ- ings of the American Renaissance. Here the limitations of his hermeneutical method be- come visible. He suggests that Mather's vi- sion survived for several Puritan generations because it was compensatory for a growing sense of psychic uncertainty and political fail- ure, but at the end of his essay Bercovitch concedes that "the changing relations be- tween myth and society in America require a separate study." He falls back upon the ex- planation that the rhetoric survived out of merit "because it was compelling enough in content and flexible enough in form to invite adaptation." No doubt it was, but the missing link in this story is the eighteenth century, which in- cluded not only the great revivals of the 1 740s but also the Jeffersonian agrarian myth of America. For Bercovitch, "the myth of Amer- ica is the creation of the New England Way." How, then, account for Jefferson's proposal of a national seal picturing on one side the Israelites pursued by a pillar of fire? The alliance between the Calvinist republicans and the rationalist republicans of 1776 cannot be understood by exclusive attention to rhetorical continuities, examined here only in a brief reference to a famous poem of the 1 770s. Without the eighteenth century the leap to the nineteenth is even more puzzling. Like Miller, Bercovitch establishes a reso- nance between Edwards and Emerson. But whereas Miller saw it in their common spiri- tualization of nature, Bercovitch character- istically finds it in their way of seeing Amer- ica as a source of millennial splendor for a regenerate perceiver who transforms himself "in the image of the New World." American 603</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR romantics like George Bancroft and Walt Whitman clearly fit this pattern; often Em- erson and occasionally Thoreau do too; but Hawthorne and Melville, despite Ber- covitch 's brief, ingenious efforts to assimilate their work to the design, are much more char- acteristically ironic about it. The difference between the European romantics, celebrated by Meyer H. Abrams and Harold Bloom, and those American romantics for whom the millennium was not only the regeneracy of the soul, but also a redemptive prophetic na- tionalism, is not as pervasive as Bercovitch implies. But one of the values in his bold reversal of the usual claim that it was the Europeans who had a more communal sense of self is his recognition that Emerson's de- mand for independence was also allied to a denunciation, in American style, of eccentric- ity and elitism. The Emersonian hero has a national role to play. The book ends with the elliptical sugges- tion that the design it has traced from Mather to Whitman through Edwards to Emerson may be, in the Marxist sense, an ideology for "the major middle-class civilization of mod- ern times." It thus points toward a political story of the idea of redemptive history with- out ever exploring it. Like the Mock Turtle, whose school at the bottom of the sea had a regular course including "Mystery, ancient and modern," Bercovitch dives deeper than he can swim far. Yet the idea persists even in some of our pioneer "realists." I offer him another footnote: De Forest's Miss RaveneVs Conversion from Secession to Loyalty, in which Dr. Ravenel compares John Wilkes Booth to Judas, Lincoln to Jesus, and history to a five- act drama beginning with the Christian reve- lation and having a fifth act in the Civil War. Not surprisingly, the novel's hero, who "like the nation" has "developed and learned his powers," comes from a thinly disguised New Haven where modern editions of the works of Jonathan Edwards are still coming out. "To be an American," Santayana said, "is of itself almost a moral condition, an educa- tion, and a career." Canadian-born, Berco- vitch understands the crucial point that American literature is involved not so much with the universal archetypes favored by cur- rent critics as it is with the historical myths of our political religions.</page></plain_text>
