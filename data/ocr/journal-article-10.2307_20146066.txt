<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book review J. W. Silvertown, Introduction to Plant Population Ecology. 1982.209 pp., 94 figs. Longman, London. ISBN 0-582-44265-6. Price ? 7.95. In the last decade a number of handbooks have appeared dealing with dynamics and genetics of plant populations. These textbooks are well illus trated and abundantly provided with references. Unfortunately, however, they were generally high priced and therefore not very easily accessible for students, and due to the fast developments in this field they date quickly. Now Silvertown has written a very readable in troduction on the subject. Very congenially, he ded icated the book to all students fighting racism. The book has been composed in clear and consistent chapters in which models of population dynamics, life tables and fecundity schedules, seed dispersal, seed banks, and seedling recruitment are described. Furthermore, Silvertown treats the demography of various types of plants, reproduction, density regu lation, and vegetative propagation and clonal growth. Finally, interference and co-existence of plant populations are discussed. Although the au thor has tried to quantify factors, he never demands an advanced level of mathematics. Sometimes, splendid plant silhouettes are added to the figures to indicate the stature of the species discussed. Regrettably, some figures and a number of cap tions to figures contain minor and major errors and omissions, or unwarranted simplifications. Thus, in Figure 2.5 Sarukhan's term 'enforced dormant seeds' has been replaced by the less precise 'active seeds'. In this figure the caption is rather mislead ing. Also in other figures (e.g. Figs. 3.1, 3.17,4.10, and 5.13) annoying mistakes or omissions occur. In this book Silvertown introduces a new con cept, the Oskar syndrome, referring to G?nther Grass' novel 'Die Blechtrommel' (The Tin Drum). In this novel the central figure, Oskar, at the age of three decided to stay juvenile and to stop growing. Silvertown compares the presence of a seedling pool which is found in some woodland species with this Oskar syndrome, and he introduces the name 'oskars' for these seedlings. The term syndrome refers to a complex of pathological symptoms that characterizes patients with regard to healthy per sons. Therefore, it seems to me rather unlucky to introduce this very anthropomorphic concept of oskars: the population itself does not decide to stay in a juvenile stage, but unfavourable environmental factors (e.g. the light-climate in a woodland under story) inhibit further growth. When conditions are getting more favourable, for instance if gaps are created, such seedlings can develop into the adult phase locally. The plasticity of some shade-tolerant species, determined genetically to survive the poor light-climate in woodlands over long periods, can be a very important adaptation compared with shade-intolerant species. The suggestion that such plants are ill (syndrome) or 'determined to remain small' is confusing rather than accurately describ ing the state of affairs. In agreement with Harper and White, the author distinguishes an environmental sieve in the inter phase between seed pool and the establishment of seedlings. It is unclear why such environmental sieves cannot be found in other interphases, e.g. between seedling recruitment and vegetative stage (see the example of the woodland understory spe cies) and between the latter stage and the reproduc tive phase. Although MacArthur and Wilson's r and K model is the most widely used strategy model in population ecology, other models (e.g. Grime's CSR model, Rabotnov's phytocoenotypes, Dur ing's life strategies in bryophytes) deserve short ref erence in a textbook like Silvertown's. Overall Sil vertown succeeded in writing a clear and concise, useful and up-to-date introduction into the funda mental aspects of population ecology. The book is well printed, richly illustrated, and its price is low. H. J. Verkaar, Utrecht Vegetado 56, 86(1984). ? Dr W. Junk Publishers, The Hague. Printed in the Netherlands.</page></plain_text>
