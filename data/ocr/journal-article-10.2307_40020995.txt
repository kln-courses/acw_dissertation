The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada 1. Kai Nielsen, the demise of the tradition, and the possibility for God-talk In a recent article entitled "Taking Rorty Seriously"1 Kai Nielsen continues his examination of Rorty's metaphilosophical position.2 Nielsen's reading, which is largely sympathetic, has been welcomed by many who feel that Rorty is still brushed off too easily by mainstream philosophers. What is troubling, however, are the implications Nielsen's ongoing treatment of Rorty has for the philosophy of religion - or more specifically God-talk. Those aquatinted with the prolific writings of Nielsen are well aware of his extensive critique of religious belief.3 He has, over the years, examined the most prevalent arguments for religious belief and has concluded that all fail to show that such belief is meaningful.4 His main argument against religious belief is not "whether God's existence could in some way be proven but rather the stress is on the question of whether God-talk of the appropriate sort is or is not coherent."5 God-talk has been examined so extensively that Nielsen has in fact written that his is merely a "mopping up job": There is little interest now in so-called proofs for the existence of God. The salvoes fired against these classical arguments by Hume and Kant have been, though sometimes in rather reconstructed forms, convincing to philosophers. There are those who would claim that some of these attempted proofs are useful in giving us a sense of deity but, a few scho- lastic philosophers apart, few would claim they give us a proof of, or even good evidence for, the existence of God.6 Of course Nielsen has not only concentrated his critique on the "proofs" for the existence of God. He has looked at a wide-range of attempts by theists who argue for the coherency of their beliefs, and has maintained that none fair better; whether using Wittgenstein's language games,7 Tillich's Uncon- ditioned Transcendent,8 or Otto's Numinous,9 to name a few. And so, after close inspection, Nielsen says, "Christianity is myth-eaten. The very intelli-</page><page sequence="2">1 02 G. ELIJAH DANN gibility of the key concepts of the religion is seriously in question; there is no evidence whatsoever for the existence of God."10 Yet Nielsen's seemingly devastating critique of God-talk stands in contrast to his appraisal of Rorty, particularly because of two reasons. Firstly, as far as the philosophy of religion is concerned, once Nielsen accepts Rorty's metaphilosophical position, and the hardy tools of traditional philosophy are dropped, what are the consequences for Nielsen's robust critique of God-talk? That is, Nielsen agrees with Rorty that philosophers should discard grand narratives of reality, as well as sturdy definitions of truth, reason, and objectivity. Metaphysicians should drop their attempts to describe the nature of reality. For their part, epistemologists should abandon all efforts to establish a foundation for knowledge. Nielsen believes, again with Rorty, that by doing so we will be giving up Philosophy, but not philosophy.11 If so, could some forms of religious belief be compatible with this pared down version of philosophy? Or, put slightly different, once all the shiny tools of Philosophy are discarded, does God-talk once again become a legitimate form of discourse? I wish to argue that as long as the philosopher of religion and theologian are mindful of the limitations of philosophy, and therefore the limitations of God-talk, then this way of speaking remains a possibility in the post-Philosophical context. Secondly, this possibility shows an interesting difference between Rorty and Nielsen. In post-Philosophical culture Rorty allows for the prospect for religious belief.12 Nielsen, however, does not even appear to consider the issue. Why this difference? It may be that Rorty recognizes more clearly, after the demise of Philos- ophy, the limitations his position holds for deciding which beliefs are legit- imate in liberal society. Nielsen, while agreeing to the same limitations, but believing that religious belief has long since been shown to be incredulous, does not reconsider the question. Yet there is a real issue to be broached here. Does not Nielsen's (even qualified) acceptance of Rorty's metaphilosophical views necessitate a reevaluation of religious belief? In short, if we are to take Rorty seriously, should we not do the same with God-talk? 2. Embracing Rorty In his most recent article on Rorty, "Taking Rorty Seriously" Nielsen continues his evaluation of Rorty's metaphilosophical views, especially in light of their compatibility with analytical Marxism. Not far into his article Nielsen reiterates his assessment of Rorty. It is one that has remained constant:</page><page sequence="3">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? 1 03 [Rorty] does argue, clearly and probingly, and he does, his occasional disavowals notwithstanding, in fact have a clearly articulated and care- fully interlocked form of pragmatism that includes a well-thought-out metaphilosophy, a metaphilosophy that deeply challenges how philos- ophy, particularly in our ambience, is both standardly practised and conceptualized (usually rather uncritically).13 And while these "challenges" are in some cases as applicable for the Contin- ental side as for the analytic side of philosophy, Rorty 's primary target is often the latter:14 Rorty's account, in fine, is a nuanced, not unsystematic, account that comes to grips with central issues both in and about analytic philosophy in a way that deserves careful - though, of course, not uncritical - attention. He is not to be shrugged off, as he so often is, as an irresponsible figure of fun frolicking with Derrida in Paris.15 This sympathy and support of Rorty's metaphilosophy is the "text" of Nielsen's article. But Nielsen has two additional "subtexts" here as well. The first subtext is that the Left has unfairly received Rorty. That is, Rorty is neither a dupe of the American capitalist order, nor an "irresponsible shoot- from-the-hip"16 social commentator. Rather, Rorty is "firmly committed to intelligently commenting on the social and political problems of our time."17 Nielsen's second subtext is that Rorty and the neo-pragmatists "should not be so spooked by the ghost of 'grand theory' that they continue to ignore the careful and politically relevant work of analytical Marxians."18 The purpose of my study is not to evaluate the relevance of Rorty's views for the Left or for Nielsen's Marxians. Yet these "texts" have interesting implications for the philosophy of religion, whether it is Nielsen's "main text" (i.e., his agreement with Rorty's position) or the two "subtexts". Suffice here to note, given the first subtext, just as the Left need not be fearful of Rorty, so philosophers of religion need not fear Rorty either.19 Indeed, Rorty's views about antirepresentation, truth and justification need not be seen as necessarily hostile to religious belief - even Christian belief. As for the second subtext, while Nielsen believes that analytical Marxism is deserving of Rorty's attention, no such prodding is required on behalf of the philosopher of religion. Rorty has acknowledged that some forms of religious belief are compatible with his account of philosophy. And so Nielsen might think that, after all, if Rorty considers religious belief after the demise of the tradition, should he not also consider the compatibility with analytical Marxians? Of course whether Rorty decides to do so is up to him. What is more important, at least in this present study, is to show how this acceptance of Rorty's metaphilosophy stands in contrast to Nielsen's original critique of</page><page sequence="4">104 G. ELIJAH DANN God-talk. To this end we will first survey Rorty's key claims, secondly review Nielsen's main criticisms of God-talk, and lastly show how these criticisms stand in contrast to Nielsen's current metaphilosophical beliefs. 3. Problems with representationalism Nielsen is well aware of Rorty's antirepresentationalism. In section 3 of Nielsen's article, he reviews in some detail Rorty's position on this matter.20 As an antirepresentationalist Rorty situates himself within a Deweyan, Wittgensteinian, and Heideggerian view of philosophy. Knowledge, on this view, is not a matter of showing correspondence between belief and reality. Instead, knowledge is a matter of "acquiring habits of action for coping with reality."21 But what about reality? Is there not a world outside of our minds,22 one to which we must compare our beliefs in order to decide if they are true? Rorty certainly is not a skeptic.23 Neither is he an idealist (although he shares with the Idealist doubt over the belief that "truth is correspondence to reality").24 Rorty believes that there is a real world;25 yet any attempt to try to show how our minds or language corresponds to or represents our environment is misguided.26 What does he mean here? Rorty distinguishes between corresponding, or representing small-scale beliefs with "the world" and doing likewise with large-scale beliefs.27 With the former, we are quite successful pairing-off our ideas with a visual image - such as a designer with her clothes, an architect with his buildings, or an artist with her paintings. "Mapping"28 large-scale beliefs are quite a different matter. How do we even begin to make sense of the claim, for example, that one's religion or politics corresponds to the way the world is?29 Sometimes, of course, they [sic] are pictures or representations, as when we use an illustrated dictionary or field guides to identify birds or wanted posters to identify criminals. Then we have representations in the proper sense - items some of whose parts can be correlated one-to-one with parts of the thing being represented (a condition that obviously does not hold for most sentences or beliefs).30 Rorty is adamant on this point of correspondence. Instead of seeing our philo- sophical beliefs arising through pictures and metaphor, traditional philosophy accounts for our convictions by means of propositions and statements. And while we may be able to pair off bits of our language with bits of the world, doing this with large-scale representations is quite impossible. Instead of a representationalist theory of meaning, Rorty subscribes to the holistic theory of meaning. That is, a language must do no more than give</page><page sequence="5">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? 1 05 an account of how the meaning of sentences depend upon the meaning of words.31 At the crux of this theory is the Davidsonian point that we need not think that "individual words must have meanings at all, in any sense that transcends the fact that they have a systematic effect on the meanings of the sentences in which they occur."32 In another place Rorty states that this "Davidsonian way of looking at language ... the activity of uttering sentences is one of the things people do in order to cope with their environment. The Deweyan notion of language as tool rather than picture is right as far as it goes."33 This view of language stands in contrast to the traditional view of language: The traditional view is that we anchor language to the world by giving meaning by ostension (or some other nonintentional mechanism - once which presupposes no "stage-setting in the language") to certain words, and then going on holistically from there. Davidson's neo-Wittgensteinian point is that even "red" and "mama" have uses - can help make possible the statements of truths - only in the context of sentences and thus of a whole language.34 Rorty contends, however, that our beliefs are not derived by corresponding language with reality, but rather by showing how various sentences work within the context of the language spoken. If Rorty discards the theory of truth as representation how does one then distinguish true statements from false statements? Sense from nonsense? Can we even speak of objectivity? What account does Rorty offer in response to these concerns? As an antirepresentationalist, Rorty desires to reduce issues of representa- tion and objectivity to solidarity. If one speaks of objectivity it should not be objectivity construed as the attempt to move outside one's society. Objectivity should rather be understood as the attempt to extend intersubjective agree- ment as far as possible. It is the desire "to extend the reference of 'us' as far as we can."35 Those who do this are pragmatists. "Within the philosophical community, they are best known as holists."36 Rejecting both metaphysics and epistemology, pragmatists view truth in William James' sense of "what is good for us to believe."37 This view of truth stands in contrast to truth understood as the "accurate representation of reality."38 Instead of being preoccupied with the traditional concepts of objectivity and representation, attention is turned towards the needs of a democratic society. The pragmatist's goal is to enhance solidarity. Here is Dewey's view of a society - one that is democratic, progressive, and pluralist. Society works toward establishing greater and greater intersubjective agree- ment and novelty:</page><page sequence="6">106 G. ELIJAH DANN If one reinterprets objectivity as intersubjectivity, or as solidarity, in the ways I suggest below, then one will drop the question of how to get in touch with "mind-independent and language-independent reality." One will replace it with questions like "What are the limits of our community? Are the encounters sufficiently free and open? Has what we have recently gained in solidarity cost us our ability to listen to outsiders who are suffering? To outsiders who have new ideas?" These are political questions rather than metaphysical or epistemological ques- tions. Dewey seems to me to have given us the right lead when he viewed pragmatism not as grounding, but as clearing the ground for, democratic politics.39 By changing the philosophical conversation thusly, what are the implications for God-talk? In contrast to the often antagonistic relationship between tradi- tional philosophy and religious belief, once antireprestationalism replaces representation and the traditional sense of objectivity, is it possible for God- talk to find a place within this intersubjectivity? Granted, it will be a pared down version of God-talk, in line with changing the conversation from meta- physical and epistemological questions to public conversations of solidarity and private hopes. But is not God-talk at least an option in Rorty's post- Philosophical culture? To explore this further we need to review Rorty's view of truth. 4. What about "truth"? Rorty has made it quite clear that he rejects any essentialist view of truth - that truth is some sort of reified object existing over and above that of the natural world. This is not to say that Rorty holds to the naive version of this denial: Actually, almost nobody (except Wallace Stevens) does say it [viz., that there is no truth]. But philosophers like me are often said to say it. One can see why. For we have learned (from Nietzsche and James, among others) to be suspicious of the appearance-reality distinction.40 Putting aside for the moment the "appearance-reality" distinction, one may question further what Rorty's view of truth actually is. To try to answer this question one immediately encounters a conceptual barrier; namely, to define a concept for which, Rorty believes, no definition is possible. Siding with Davidson, Rorty believes that the attempt to define the nature of truth should be put aside:</page><page sequence="7">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? 1 07 The greatest of my many intellectual debts to Donald Davidson is my realization that nobody should even try to specify the nature of truth . . . Davidson has helped us realize that the very absoluteness of truth is a good reason for thinking "true" indefinable and for thinking that no theory of the nature of truth is possible. It is only the relative about which there is anything to say.41 If we abandon the attempt to define truth, will we then have to cope with relativism rearing its ugly head? Without a robust definition of truth will we be left in a relativistic quagmire where everyone does what is right in his own eyes? Moreover, is Rorty's description of the "absoluteness of truth" some sort of metaphysic brought in through the back door? By saying that no theory of truth is possible, Rorty wishes to distinguish justification from truth: Truth is, to be sure, an absolute notion, in the following sense: "true for me but not for you" and "true in my culture but not in yours" are weird, pointless locutions. So is "true then, but not now." Whereas we often say "good for this purpose, but not for that" and "right in this situation, but not in that," it seems pointlessly paradoxical to relativize truth to purposes or situations. On the other hand, "justified for me but not for you" (or "justified in my culture but not in yours") makes perfect sense.42 And so while we cannot compare our beliefs with the true nature of reality, we are still able (and required) to justify our beliefs to our audience. Admittedly there is not a sense of justification that will apply in all cases to all audiences. Acceptance by an audience is dependent on the purposes of each audience. And yet, on this account, we may say that intellectual and moral progress has been made, and will continue: Certainly we have been making progress, by our own lights. That is to say, we are much better able to serve the purposes we wish to serve, and to cope with the situations we believe we face, than our ancestors would have been. But when we hypostatize the adjective "true" into "Truth" and ask about our relation to it, we have absolutely nothing to say.43 Specific examples of progress offered by Rorty are "increased health, secu- rity, equality of opportunity, longevity, [and] freedom from humiliation."44 If Rorty does not think of truth as a noun, a reified object with some sort of independent existence, then truth as correspondence is also left behind. With this in mind, it is clear why Rorty rejects this way of describing truth. Unless one holds to an essentialist view of truth (and perhaps as well the Good and the Beautiful), holding to the view of truth as correspondence is markedly</page><page sequence="8">108 G. ELIJAH DANN odd. Rorty decidedly makes the distinction "between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that truth is out there . . . Truth cannot be out there - cannot exist independently of the human mind - because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there."45 In short, Rorty maintains, philosophy will get along better "without the notions of 'intrinsic nature of reality' and 'correspondence to reality' than with them."46 5. "God's" need for a referent and Flew's Challenge Agreement with Rorty on these matters, especially on the correspondence theory of truth, stands in contrast with Nielsen's original critique of God- talk. For example, when it comes to discussions over the existence of God, Nielsen has argued that "[God] is a referring expression whose referent obviously cannot be identified by ostension."47 Moreover, because the word "God" lacks this ostensive identification (nullifying any attempt of an extra- linguistic definition) it follows that no secondary meaning can be attached to this noun (viz. definite descriptions or intra-linguistic definitions). In explaining this criticism against God-talk Nielsen offers the somewhat quaint example of two comparable sentences: "God made the heavens and the earth" and "Fred made bread and soup"48 Putting aside the issue of how the word "made" in the former sentence can be said to have any sense49 Nielsen states, "What I want to ask is what is 'God' supposed to stand for in such a sentence and how is the referent of that term to be identified?"50 In contrast to the first sentence, the second claim has a referent (v/z., "Fred") that can, at least under normal circumstances, be taught extra-linguistically (ostensibly) and/or intra-linguistically (by definite descriptions). Extra-linguistically, even if we are not acquainted with the "Fred" of this proposition we know that Fred refers to a human being, of which we have similar models. We know what kind of "reality" Fred refers to.51 If the name "Fred" is used in an ordinary sense, we know that this person could (under normal circumstances) be identified by pointing him out. Considering the activities of Fred, even if one did not know what making soup entailed, it could be ostensively taught by pointing to the activity of making soup. Since this is not possible with propositions concerning God or his activity, Nielsen concludes that God-talk, of this sort, is incoherent. With the failure of extra-linguistic definitions of God, and his assumed activity, is it possible to teach what God refers to intra-linguistically - by definite descriptions? Nielsen suggests three possible candidates. God is:</page><page sequence="9">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? 1 09 "the maker of the heavens and earth" "the being transcendent to the world, upon whom all other beings depend and who depends on no one or no thing" "the being of infinite love to whom all things are owed"52 By not establishing how the referent God can be "filled" (extra-linguistically), the sentences of this secondary type (intra-linguistically) will likewise be rendered problematic. While it is difficult enough to imagine what can be made of the word God, the alleged definite description of him "being tran- scendent to the world" certainly exacerbates the perplexity. Nielsen goes on to state: [I]f you had trouble about knowing what was referred to by the word "God," you are going to be equally puzzled about "A being transcendent to the world." How would you identify that? Or "the being of infinite love to whom all things are owed?" How do you know what it would be like to meet such a being? What is it that you're talking about in talking about a being of infinite love? Or "The maker of the heavens and the earth," rather than "The maker of the pasta and the cake?" How would you know what that refers to?53 So, whether speaking about God extra-linguistically or intra-linguistically, because of the missing referent, this way of speaking about God lacks coherence.54 6. Evaluating God-talk after the demise of the tradition In developing his view of the post-Philosophical project, and in agreement with Rorty, Nielsen speaks of putting aside metaphysical and epistemolo- gical concerns,55 truth as correspondence, and philosophical vantage points whereby the totality of society can be examined. But this metaphilosoph- ical account undermines his original evaluation of God-talk. Specifically, once abandoning the "problems and conceptions of perennial philosophy or foundationalist, even modest foundationalist epistemology and metaphysics or metaethics,"56 how can philosophy still stand in judgement over religious belief, setting forth heavy-handed Challenges of what can and cannot be considered true beliefs? An example that serves to illustrate this tension can be seen in Nielsen's repeated claim that theologians must provide the referent to the word God. In the post-Philosophical context exactly what is the sense of this demand? What does Nielsen mean by this? Is this a demand that found its impetus in the Tradition's desire to find a one-to-one correspondence between language and</page><page sequence="10">110 G. ELIJAH DANN the world outside our language? Given the demise of philosophy and the need to see it transformed, is it consistent to admit that traditional philosophy's definitions of truth and objectivity are problematic but that the theist must nevertheless show how God-talk refers to the object, God? Is this a challenge that the theist should be obliged to solve? Is this challenge coherent? Consider the contrast to the following admission by Nielsen: It is also the case that we can never compare a thought or a statement or a network of thoughts or statements with an unconceptualized reality so as to tell whether the world answers to that thought or statement or network of thoughts or statements.57 Or, describing this view Nielsen says What makes a proposition or statement true is the way the world is. There are these fact-like entitites - these truth makers - there in the world for true propositions or, if your will, sentences to correspond to. However, and unfortunately for the modest-foundationalist, the world is not prestructured into fact-like entities. The world doesn't consist in some totality of fact-like entities there to be discovered and counted and to which, one by one, or in any other way, our sentences correspond . . . To think of truth as correspondence is to assume, perhaps naturally but still utterly mistakenly, that thought or language mirrors the world. But that notion makes no sense . . .58 Nielsen agrees with Rorty's view of traditional philosophy. And although he believes that we do not have to go as far as Rorty in rejecting objectivity or critical theory when dealing with the problems of society, it is not evident that what Nielsen retains of philosophy justifies demanding that religious language must have this referent to the subject of its discourse. In fact, there are a number of places in Nielsen's most recent writings where he admits the explicit difficulty involved in this demand. For example, criticizing modest foundationalists (or perhaps better meta- physical realists), Nielsen notes that what characterizes their view is the belief that there is one uniquely true description of the world. This description of the world "tells us just what that world is, quite independently of how we happen to conceptualize it."59 The task of philosophy is to provide this description. How is this accomplished? According to this view, truthfulness is determined by matching a sentence, belief, statement, or proposition with fact-like entities that are present in the world. "There are these fact-like entities - these truth-makers - there in the world for true propositions or, if you will, sentences to correspond to."60 Granted that the modest-foundationalist's view is curiously similar to</page><page sequence="11">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? Ill Nielsen's own demand that the theist show the referent to the word God, Nielsen goes on to criticize this view at length: However, and unfortunately for the modest-foundationalist, the world is not prestructured into fact-like entities. The world doesn't consist in some totality of fact-like entities there to be discovered and counted and to which, one by one, or in any other way, our sentences correspond. Nor is our world prefabricated in terms of kinds of categories. Objects and kinds do not exist independently of conceptual schemes. There is no coherent answer to the question "How many objects are there on my desk?" It makes no sense to say that there must be a determinate number of objects in the universe and thus there is no logical possibility, some convention aside, of saying how many objects there are on my desk, in my hand, or in the universe. There are, moreover, no self-identifying objects. The world does not come precategorized, presorted, or presliced. It is the noetic activity of the mind or the establishment of linguistic convention or linguistic practices that produce the categories and categorical systems that we have. To think of truth as correspondence is to assume, perhaps naturally but still utterly mistakenly, that thought or language mirrors the world. But that notion makes no sense, for it assumes, incoherently, that the world comes precategorized in fact-like, self-identifying entities. It is also the case that we can never compare a thought or a statement or a network of thoughts or statements with an unconceptualized reality so as to tell whether the world answers to that thought or statement or network of thought or statements . . . This conception of the simple truth and of a match of the true-description of the world rests on a myth. Language, or, for that matter, thought, does not work in this simple fashion.61 How then are we to decide what propositions or truths to believe? Are we doomed to solipsism if we have no way of matching our language to the world? In a passage surprisingly familiar to Rorty's language (and once again in contrast to Nielsen's language when dealing with God-talk) Nielsen states how we come to have our various beliefs: There is no language which just tells it like it is - just records or depicts or pictures what nature is like. We rather are always, and inescapably, dependent on the societal norms or determinate uses of terms in certain linguistic and social practices (they go together) of a given society or family of societies during a given historical period. It very much appears to be the case that, at least that in that way, society determines what we can say, think and believe and what has the most foundationalist epistemic authority.62</page><page sequence="12">112 G. ELIJAH DANN These limitations notwithstanding, is it not the case, Nielsen asks reflectively, that one can at least make trivial claims? For example, that there is "a yellow breasted finch in the bush"? Nielsen contends that although this might hold under certain cases it need not hold in all cases. "What we can correctly say is that, given a certain interpretation of the sentence expressing that proposition, of the world (so specified), that (if all these conditions obtain), it is true that there is a yellow breasted finch in the bush."63 There are other interpretations, however, that would make this claim false or indeterminate. In a statement that bears relevance to God-talk, Nielsen notes that there is "no just looking and seeing what is the case. There is, of course, indeed there must be, a way the world is - we do not create the world - but we are never in a position to say, independently of human devising, the way that it is."64 Many more statements could be cited where Nielsen makes the clear distinction between our language, how we conceptualize the world, and the impossibility of somehow matching our language to the world.65 Nielsen would most certainly agree that we often come to believe what we do in a highly complex manner. The result is a highly developed web of linguistic and social practices, both on an individual and communal level. Conceptualized thusly, it is not evident that God-talk should be excluded from all linguistic and social practices because of questions of reference. And if religious belief seems at least provisionally acceptable given Nielsen's metaphilosophical position, this possibility is even more certain given Rorty's interpretation of the demise of philosophy. 7. Summary and conclusion Nielsen's has admitted that traditional philosophy has failed in its goals: the attempt to define truth as correspondence; the attempt to establish an epistemological foundation; and the attempt to find a metaphysical backdrop against which we may compare societies. When he turns to the phenomenon of God-talk (or religious belief), however, his tone is noticeably different. For example, although Nielsen holds to a view of truth as coherence, when discussing religious belief coherence becomes predicated upon the require- ment that the theist shows the correspondence between her language of God (or God-talk) and God himself. Besides post-Philosophy's disinterest in this issue, this demand overlooks an understanding of God, at least from the Judeo-Christian perspective: "Outre qu'elle affirme que nul ne peut voir Dieu, elle ajoute qu'a la difference des idoles, Dieu est innommable (Dt 4, 15; Ex 33, 20-23; Jg 13, 22; Jn 1, 18): il est denomme par cela qui le nomme. II nomme en se de-</page><page sequence="13">AND NOW, HOW ABOUT TAKING GOD-TALK SERIOUSLY? 113 nommant. II fait etre, en nommant il appelle a l'etre tout etre par rapport auquel, et parce qu'il s'y denomme, il est l'Autre radical. En nommant l'homme, en appelant tout homme par son nom, Dieu se denomme: il est le Dieu d' Abraham, ou d' Isaac, ou encore de Jacob, le Dieu de Jesus- Christ. Dieu n'est pas un nom, mais un verb. Un Dieu dont le verbe fait corps avec l'homme, et qui n'a nul besoin de &lt;gse faire un nom^&gt; (Gn 11, 4).66 The scripture not only affirms that no one can see God, it adds that contrary to idols, God is nameless (Dt 4, 15; Ex 33, 20-23; Jg 13, 22; Jn 1, 18): God is named by what is naming him. He names as one who is un-named. As the radical Other, because he is unnaming himself, in naming he calls to the being all beings and makes to be. By naming man and woman, he calls all humanity by their name, and so he becomes the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Jesus Christ. God is not a name but a verb. This verb is one with humanity; and therefore God has no need to "make himself a name" (Gn. 1 1:4).66 Perhaps Nielsen cannot be reproached for overlooking this theological under- standing of God. In any case, whether on this theological reading of God or the post-Philosophical understanding of reference, Nielsen's objection on this count misses the mark. Similar to Rorty, Nielsen argued that without the metaphysical vantage points that grant a privileged view of reality, philosophers should turn their attention to addressing the problems of humankind: Philosophers should concern themselves with the problems of our time - the deepest and most intractable problems that human beings face - but we would also like, were we are [sic] doing philosophy, if we can, to view them somehow comprehensively: to give ourselves an integrated and critical conception of who we are, were, and of whom we might become with what social institutions, social practices, and with a reflective sense of our lives together.67 Having acknowledged its limits, philosophy re-orientates its interests. The issues of systematic philosophy are to be abandoned partly because they are questions mal pose - without a final answer - and partly because the philosopher has no access to specialized tools necessary for solving these issues. The difficulty for Nielsen is that his drawn out critique of God-talk is at odds with his metaphilosophical position. One cannot consistently side with Rorty and at the same time tell those who engage in God-talk that their talk about God is incoherent because of a lack of an extra or intra</page><page sequence="14">114 G. ELIJAH DANN linguistic reference. If the God-talkers are willing to drop robust claims to truth, metaphysical musings, and concentrate on increasing inter subjectivity and solidarity, then there is as much room in post-Philosophical society for them as there is for Nielsen's analytic Marxians. In short, if we take the demise of the philosophical tradition seriously, there is no reason why theists cannot take God-talk seriously. Notes 1.

Of course, many articles could be added to this list of books. As one commentator on Nielsen has rightly pointed out, "Kai Nielsen's writings constitute a major philosophical achievement. They are so numerous and have appeared in such diverse places that some years ago he confessed that even he might not be able to produce a complete list of them. In these wide-ranging books and articles there is hardly a topic in moral philosophy or a major figure in its history that he has not treated perceptively."

(Colorado: Westview Press, 1992), p. 1. For the most current and complete bibliographical listing see this same work. 4. "I argue that it is not merely the case that there are no sound arguments for the existence of God and that the claims of religious experience give us no good evidential grounds for belief in God but that no such arguments or evidencings could do anything of the sort, for the very concept of God, where 'God' is construed non-anthropomorphically, is incoherent. The problematicity of the concept of God in developed forms of Judaism, Christianity and Islam is so deep that it is irrational for someone to believe in God who is fully aware of the problematicity. There are, of course, anthropomorphic conceptions of God - Zeus-like conceptions of God - that are coherent, but, while being coherent, it is little more than a superstition to believe that such a God exists." Kai Nielsen, "Introduction," GSM, p. 2. 5. Nielsen, GSM, p. 25. From a somewhat different perspective Pannenberg notes that theology "has to learn that after Feuerbach it can no longer mouth the word 'God' without offering any explanation; that it cannot pursue theology 'from above,' as Barth says ..."

This radical challenge calls for the end to philosophy's historic pursuit of truth, the good, and epistemological foundations. Philosophy, construed traditionally, has produced nothing of what was hoped for. Stated otherwise, "[w]e do not (or so at least it appears) have anything that counts as a distinctively philosophical knowledge. Neither in its epistemological phrasing nor in its successor logico- semantical phrasing has philosophy been able to cash in on its foundationalist claims." Nielsen, ADT, pp. 125-126. 12. See Richard Rorty, "Religious Faith, Intellectual Responsibility, and Romance," American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy, Vol. 17, No. 2 (May 1996), pp. 121-140; and "Prag- matism as Romantic Polytheism," The Revival of Pragmatism: New Essays on Social Thought, Law, and Culture, Morris Dickstein ed.

Whether it is Frege's philosophy of language or classical Husserlian phenomenology, both are attempts to place philosophy in a Kantian privileged position: "that of judging other areas of culture on the basis of its special knowledge of the 'foundations' of these areas."

Nielsen, TRS, pp. 506-508. 21. Richard Rorty, Objectivity, relativism, and truth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 1. Rorty believes that Rawls is in agreement on this view of justification: "What justifies a conception of justice is not its being true to an order antecedent and given to us, but its congruence with our deeper understanding of ourselves and our aspirations, and our realization that, given our history and the traditions embedded in our public life, it is the most reasonable doctrine for us." John Rawls, "Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory," Journal of Philosophy, 11 (1980), p. 519; as quoted by Richard Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 58. 22. On the question of the "mind-body" problem, see Rorty's, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. 23. Rorty, presumably, would not be adverse to what Hume described as "reasonable skep- ticism." As Cleanthes defines it in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion: "The declared profession of every reasonable skeptic is only to reject abstruse, remote, and refined arguments; to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature; and to assent, wherever any reasons strike him prevent it." David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1985), p. 25. 24. Rorty, ORT, p. 64. 25. We "need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that truth is out there . . . Truth cannot be out there - cannot exist independently of the human mind - because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there." Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, pp. 4-5. This goes for laws of logic and other principles of this sort: "There are, of course, lots of criteria which cut across all divisions between parts of culture - e.g., the laws of logic, the principle that a notorious liar's reports do not count as evidence, and the like. But these do not possess some special authority by virtue of their</page><page sequence="16">116 G. ELIJAH DANN universality, any more than the set consisting of the fulcrum, the screw, and the level is privileged by virtue of contributing to every other machine." Rorty, CIS, p. xlvii, ft. nt. 51. 26. Speaking of Wittgenstein's and Davidson's view of the relation of language to the world, Rorty states that they "both want us to see the relation as merely causal, rather than also representational. Both philosophers would like us to stop thinking that there is something called 'language' which is a 'scheme' which can organize, or fit, or stand in some other noncausal relation to, a 'content' called 'the world'." Rorty, ORT, p. 60. 27. Letson comments on this difference by noting: "[A]ccording to Rorty, the trouble with correspondence is that such mundane [small-scale] demonstrations of correspondence yield nothing very interesting in the way of helping us to be better knowers . . . Rorty rejects any sense of large-scale correspondence for theories and with it any hope for a piece-by-piece justification of the sentences of theories. What this leaves us with is an account of justification that is coherentist and holistic in nature." Ben H. Letson, Davidson's Theory of Truth and Its Implications for Rorty 9s Pragmatism (New York: Peter Lang, 1997), pp. 13, 17. See, as well, page 31 of this same text. For further discussion see my review of Letson 's book in The Review of Metaphysics (December 2000). 28. Or, "the 'tie' between words and the world ... '[to be] held captive by a picture.'" Richard Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982), p. 114. 29. This is a Humean point: "[W]hile at the same time we are employed upon objects which, we must be sensible, are too large for our grasp, and of all others, require most to be familiarized to our apprehension. We are like foreigners in a strange country to whom everything must seem suspicious, and who are in danger every moment of transgressing against the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and converse." Hume, DCNR, p. 7. 30. Richard Rorty, Truth and Progress, Philosophical Papers Volume 3 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 96. "Given a language and a view of what the world is like, one can, to be sure, pair off bits of the language with bits of what one takes the world to be in such a way that the sentences one believes true have internal structures isomorphic to relations between things in the world. When we rap out routine undeliberated reports like 'This is water,' 'That's red,' 'That's ugly,' 'That's immoral,' our short categorical sentences can easily be thought of as pictures, or as symbols which fit together to make a map. Such reports do indeed pair little bits of language with little bits of the world . . . The great fallacy of the tradition, the pragmatists tell us, is to think that the metaphors of vision, correspondence, mapping, picturing, and representation which apply to small, routine assertions, will apply to large and debatable ones. This basic error begets the notion that where there are no objects to correspond to we have no hope of rationality, but only taste, passion, and will." Rorty, CS, pp. 162, 164. Elsewhere Rorty states "we cannot go back and forth between our statements about electrons and electrons, or our ascriptions of belief and beliefs, and pair them off as we pair off bits of the chart and bits of Maine. This would be, as Wittgenstein said, like checking what is said in the newspaper against another copy of the same paper." Rorty, TP, p. 115. These claims by Rorty accord with Gutting's understanding of Rorty: "I think Rorty should have no difficulty accepting Michael Devitt's point that Rorty's critique of correspondence as an epistemological theory does not, in principle, exclude it as an element in a causal expla- nation of knowledge." Gary Gutting, Pragmatic Liberalism and the Critique of Modernity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 16, ft. nt. 9.

I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising the point that there are a number of options here: "I may have a semantic or a coherence theory of meaning and a semantic or coherence theory of truth. The two theories are independent. And the same can be said about the distinction between a theory of truth and a theory of verification (or justi- fication) . . . [Rorty seems to think] that the fact that one embraces a coherence theory of justification entails that one abandon a semantic, or correspondence theory of truth. This simply does not follow." The reviewer is quite right in raising this issue against Rorty and Nielsen. But Rorty, as he notes in many places in his writings, feels right in giving up the problems these issues raise. Rorty perhaps puts it best where he says "If you give up on the project of escaping from 'human peculiarities and perspectives,' then the important question will be about what sort of human being you want to become . . . then this question will divide into two sub-questions. The first is: with what communities should you identify, of which should you think of yourself as a member? The second is (to adapt Whitehead's definition of religion): what should I do with my aloneness? The first is a question about your obligations to other human beings. The second is about your obligation to, in Nietzsche's words, become who you are." Rorty, ORT, p. 13. 35. Rorty, ORT, p. 23. For his part, Kai Nielsen understands objectivity in the following terms: "we say that a morality or a set of moral views is justified ('objectively justified' if that isn't pleonastic) when, at a given time in a cool hour, among reasonable people properly informed, these people achieve a reflective consensus on what is to be done and on what moral views to hold." The advantage of defining objectivity in this manner is that it is an "utterly nonmetaphysical conception of objectivity compatible with reflective common sense ('critical commonsensism,' to use Peirce's phrase) and with an appeal to our considered judgments." Nielsen, ADT, pp. 242-243. 36. Rorty, ORT, p. 64. Elsewhere he states that "[o]nce conversation replaces confrontation, the notion of the mind as Mirror of Nature can be discarded. The notion of philosophy as the discipline which looks for privileged representations among those constituting the Mirror becomes unintelligible. A thoroughgoing holism has no place for the notion of philosophy as 'conceptual,' as 'apodictic,' as picking out the 'foundations' of the rest of knowledge, as explaining which representations are 'purely given' or 'purely conceptual,' as presenting a 'canonical notation' rather than an empirical discovery, or as isolating 'trans-framework heuristic categories.' If we see knowledge as a matter of conversation and of social practice, rather than as an attempt to mirror nature, we will not be likely to envisage a metapractice which will be the critique of all possible forms of social practice. So holism produces, as Quine has argued in detail and Sellars has said in passing, a conception of philosophy which has nothing to do with the quest for certainty." Rorty, PMN, pp. 170-172. 37. Rorty, ORT, p. 22; emphasis his. In another place, Rorty has a slight variant on this statement by James as stating, "what is better for us to believe." Rorty, PMN, p. 10. 38. Rorty, PMN, p. 10. 39. Rorty, ORT, p. 13. 40. Rorty, TP, p. 1. Rorty believes that this holds even for the postmodernists: "The quarrel is often described as between people who no longer believe in Truth and those who still do believe in it. But this is misleading. Nobody, not even the most far-out post-modernist,</page><page sequence="18">118 G. ELIJAH DANN believes that there is no difference between the statements we call true and those we call false. Like everybody else, post-modernists recognize that some beliefs are more reliable tools than others, and that agreement on which tools to use is essential for social cooperation."

"Pragmatists think that if something makes no difference to practice, it should make no difference to philosophy. This conviction makes them suspicious of the distinction between justification and truth, for that difference makes no difference to my decisions about what to do. If I have concrete, specific doubts about whether one of my beliefs is true, I can resolve those doubts only by asking whether it is adequately justified - by finding and assessing additional reasons pro and con. I cannot bypass justification and confine my attention to truth: assessment of truth and assessment of justification are, when the question is about what I should believe now, the same activity." Rorty, TP, p. 19. 43. Rorty, TP, p. 4. 44. Rorty, TP, p. 4. Put another way Rorty has said, "To say that we think we're heading in the right direction is just to say, with Kuhn, that we can, by hindsight, tell the story of the past as a story of progress."

Concerning the concept of "made," in the theistic sense, Nielsen notes that ". . . there is the ancient point that 'to make something' presupposes that there already is something out of which it is made. If it is replied that . . . God is taken to be the final cause and not the efficient cause of the universe and that 'make' here means 'sustain' or 'order,' then it should be noted that this still presupposes something to be sustained or ordered; there is no use for 'ordering or sustaining out of nothing.'"

See his God and Philosophy (London: Hutchinson, 1966); and The Presumption of Atheism (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1976). We may note, at least provisionally, that the question of the reference to the word God has an ancient history. The Old Testament resisted any attempt to provide this referent to God because any attempted referent would have been taken as an instance of idolatry. As Pannenberg notes "'Holiness' is the Old Testament's word for God's otherness. Yahweh holiness prohibits not only his representation in a cult-image, but abso- lutely every attempt to compare him with something else." This was even extended to the prohibition of mentioning his personal name. "In every act of naming there is an element of seizing possession (Gen. 2:19), which was supposed to be guarded against in relation to God by the prohibition against misusing his name just as much as by the prohibition against images." Pannenberg cites Isaiah 40:25: "To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One." He notes further that Koch has shown that Deutero-Isaiah "provides a comprehensive basis for the prohibition against images in this repudiation of all comparisons."

"My Deweyian account does not presuppose a position in metaethics, the epistemology of morals or epistemology more generally, in metaphysics, or the acceptance of a distinctive normative ethical theory . . ."

This statement, although it raises particular diffi- culties, seems lightweight in comparison to the phrase The Lord is in the heavens. The point here is that whether speaking of a yellow-breasted finch or the Lord, showing how our language matches the object spoken of is a highly questionable demand on the part of the traditional philosopher. 64. Nielsen, OTP, p. 140. Compare this with Kuipers description of Rorty's position: "Rorty's critique of metaphysical realism has at least two dimensions: epistemological and ontolo- gical. Realism, for Rorty, is the position that accepts the existence of a mind-independent 'world in itself (the ontological dimension), and on that basis considers knowledge as justified and true only when we can show that our statements have immediate, privileged access to this mind-independent reality (the epistemological dimension). Rorty does not only question whether or not such a description of human knowledge is accurate, but whether it is useful any longer. Because such a detached construal of human knowledge cannot effectively be used in the service of our particular cultural problems, he suggests that we are better off to leave such outmoded philosophical concerns behind."
