<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Sensitive Plant" as Original Fantasy RICHARD S. CALDWELL IT often happens that important discoveries in one area of knowledge make it possible for striking, if unforeseen, advances to be made in another area, or areas, as well. A particularly well-known illustration of this is the application, with revolution ary effect, of Saussure's linguistic theories to myth by LeVi-Strauss, to literature by Barthes and Todorov, and to psychoanalysis by Lacan. A similar opportunity, it seems to me, now exists for the re-interpretation of Shelley's poetry, in the light of recent re search in psychoanalytic theory and practice. As I hope to show, this research, characterized especially by emphasis on the earliest mother-child relationship and on first self-other differentiation, can provide us with a new standpoint from which to grasp the hidden levels of unity within a specific poem and also, perhaps, within the entire corpus of Shelley's poetry. It would appear that "The Sensitive Plant" is an appropriate testing-ground for this new kind of psychoanalytic criticism, not only because many thematic concerns of Shelley's better-known works occur in it, but also because it would seem to be a poem particularly recalcitrant both to modern tastes and to modern theories. What better test for the applicability of a modern critical method than these long lists of flowers and weeds, this apparently Platonic allegory based on a specific concern of eighteenth-century botanical science? The "sensitive plant" (from a botanical point of view) was, as Wasserman notes,1 the subject of much discussion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Better known as the mimosa, it was given the name "sensitive plant" because of its peculiar sensitivity to external stimuli, a trait which made of it a symbolic hybrid between the vegetable and animal worlds. Be cause it seemed to violate the limits of natural categories, it be came a popular topos for philosophical and scientific treatises, 1. Earl Wasserman, Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: The Johns Hop kins U. Press, 1971), p. 157.

CALDWELL and it also lent itself readily to poetic allegory. Therefore, as many critics maintain, Shelley used the Sensitive Plant as the protagonist (or plantagonist) of his poem because it is an allegory in which the Sensitive Plant is endowed with non-plant, i.e., human, qual ities. I would suggest, however, that we can view the unique prop erties of the Sensitive Plant, as employed by Shelley, in another light. The Sensitive Plant is a borderline phenomenon, possessing the attributes of two different realms and therefore belonging ex clusively to neither. Standing at the intersection of categories, sub jected to the tension of opposing forces, it suggests to me (and, I think, in some way to Shelley) not a physical boundary but a psychic borderline, the division in our mind and self between the perceptions and self-awareness of consciousness on one hand and a dimly-felt yearning for absolute pleasure and peace on the other, a lost world known only to poets but recognized sporadically by us ordinary mortals in the recurrent disproportion between our de sires and their fulfillment (and in our dreams). This, in briefest span, is the basis of my interpretation of the Sensitive Plant, both as poem and as a figure within the poem. In order to be more specific, however, I would like first to discuss certain developments in current psychoanalytic theory. I One of the most significant changes in psychoanalytic theory during the past twenty years has been an increasingly greater emphasis on, and knowledge of, pre-oedipal developmental stages, in particular the dramatic and influential events of the first eighteen months of life. Once the Oedipus complex was as far back as one went, or needed to go; but more and more the Oedipus complex is being seen not as an original configuration of desire, fear, and prohibition, but rather as a final infantile development which puts a lasting and culturally-approved stamp on configurations which go back to the first year of life, to the developmental phases technically known as symbiosis and individuation. When Freud said in 1905 that "Every state of being in love reproduces infantile prototypes" and "the finding of an object is in fact a re-finding,"2 2.

The balance has been largely redressed in recent years, however, thanks largely to the research of the child analysts Winni cott in England and Spitz, Jacobson, and Mahler in this country. On the basis of their discoveries, particularly concerning the matters of symbiosis and individuation, I would like to offer the following developmental hypothesis as a heuristic model on which to base an interpretation of "The Sensitive Plant." The term symbiosis refers to "the infant's exclusive attachment to, and dependence upon, the mother" during the first months of life, as well as to the mother's "complementary involvement with the infant." It also refers, metaphorically, to "that state of undiffer entiation, of fusion with the mother, in which the T is not yet differentiated from the 'non-I' and in which inside and outside are only gradually coming to be sensed as different."4 During the sym biotic phase, the psyche is an undifferentiated system, and the infant exists in a "condition of diffuse dispersion of instinctual forces within the whole undifferentiated psychophysiological self."5 The infant is, in Lichtenstein's term, an "organ within an organ ism,"6 an element in what is sometimes called a "dual-unity sys tem" (existing in a state of absolute homeostasis, at least in the sense that all needs are gratified intrasystemically). Although con sciousness is quite rudimentary, memory-traces of pleasure and unpleasure are acquired which will be of fundamental importance 3. D. W.

CALDWELL later on; it seems clear that "long before the infant becomes aware of the mother as a person and of his own self, engrams are laid down of experiences which reflect his responses to maternal care in the realm of his entire mental and body self."7 The term individuation, or separation-individuation, refers to the establishment of self-representations as a result of the differen tiation between self and other, subject and object. One half of what had been the symbiotic unity now becomes known as the Other, but it is only through its loss, or absence, that this recogni tion is accomplished, and it is only through recognition of the other as lost object that the subject is established. Thus the process of separation-individuation is the scene of first object-loss, first separation anxiety, and first symbolic activity, the beginning of the ego system and the constitution of the unconscious. As the psyche is separated into conscious and unconscious systems at the time of, and as a result of, individuation, memory-traces of the symbiotic phase become the first contents of the primal unconscious, contents which can never be allowed into consciousness and whose existence Freud may have been attempting to explain by his theory of "primal repression."8 The experiences of symbiotic satisfaction persist in the uncon scious as memory-traces, and the first unconscious desires, based on the memories of lost pleasure, will aim at regaining the lost part of the once all-enclusive self. The ideational representatives which signify the lost and desired state will consist of images of gratifica tion and merging in a lost world, the standard against which later pleasurable experiences will be measured. It should be emphasized that the desire to return to symbiosis cannot be equated exactly with desire for the mother, both because what has been lost is not a separate being but rather a part of the self (which becomes known as the mother) and also because this desire is not desire for an object but rather the desire to return to an asubjective state prior to the discovery of difference. Since there is no absence or lack prior to self-other differentiation, there is no subject or object or 7. Jacobson, pp. 34-35. 8. See Winnicott, p. 38: "The events of these earliest stages cannot be thought of as lost through what we know as the mechanisms of repression, and there fore analysts cannot expect to find them appearing as a result of work which lessens the forces of repression. It is possible that Freud was trying to allow for these phenomena when he used the term primal repression, but this is open to argument."</page><page sequence="5">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 225 desire. Thus the desire to return to this state is the paradoxical desire not to desire. In the process of individuation, representations of the new state of separateness will now appear alongside the memory-traces of symbiosis. The result is both a paradox and a source of conflict. Desire, appearing by virtue of loss, will have as its object that which maintains the existence of the individual: nourishment, security, love, represented in objects momentarily lost and thus generating both anxiety and desire?but desire will be essentially modelled on the memory-traces of the symbiotic state which is lost forever. As an example of this modelling, the sexual drive itself, whose chief purpose is the continuation of the species, will base its aims and objects on the experiences of the symbiotic phase and will find its culmination in the act which comes closest, in the experience of the post-symbiotic individual, to a recapturing of symbiotic fusion. The unconscious desires which are constructed on the first un conscious images will be from the outset frozen in conflict: the desire to return to the pre-individual state of symbiosis, and the desire to preserve that individual state in which identity and the self are now encapsulated. Thus, as Mahler says, "the entire life cycle constitutes a more or less successful process of distancing from and introjection of the lost symbiotic mother, an eternal longing for the actual or fantasied 'ideal state of self/ with the latter standing for a symbiotic fusion with the all-good symbiotic mother, who was at one time part of the self in a blissful state of well-being."9 We might recall at this point that Freud, in attempting to recon cile the aim of the sexual drive (towards loss of the self in the assimilatory establishment of greater unities) with the assumed regressive and conservative nature of the instincts, referred twice to the myth told by Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium: human beings are like halves of an original double, and human desire is the vain longing to return to the original state. Unable to find a basis in reality for this myth, Freud said, "here, I think, the moment has come for breaking off."10 But we may now see that the "ancient 9.

CALDWELL need" of which the myth speaks is a representation of the desire for symbiosis, and we may further note, in a section of the myth not cited by Freud, a suggestion of the hidden persistence of sym biotic memories and desires in the unconscious: "the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not ap pear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment."11 Two further brief points should be made in this psychoanalytic preamble. First, although the desire for symbiosis is desire for a state, not for an object, it is important to recognize that symbiotic memories and desires become attached to, and influence, later object-relations throughout childhood and throughout life. Thus symbiotic desire may well appear connected with the desire for the mother as lost object during the second year of life, for the parent as incestuous object during the Oedipus complex, or for the sexual object of adulthood. The unconscious memory of sym biosis persists as the prototype of total gratification, the uncon scious desire for symbiosis remains as the prototype of desire as impossible, unsatisfiable, and total. While the Oedipus complex is of crucial importance in determining the choice of love-object throughout later life, this complex itself, of all life's vicissitudes, stands in closest relation (one might say reciprocity) with the experiences of symbiosis-individuation. In both situations it is the absolute impossibility of desire that is of emphatic importance, and in both desire is centered on the figure of the mother, as incestuous object or as first representation of the lost part of the self. Thus we may expect to find in the deepest levels of erotic fantasy the same configuration of retroactive elements which figure so prominently in Shelley's poetry: longing for fusion and the annihilation equivalent to total gratification, the idealized representation of the sexual object, the intimation that what is most desired is a lost part of the self. Second, I use the term "original fantasy" to describe Shelley's poem for two reasons: (1) to establish a connection with Freud's concept of Urphantasien, typical fantasy structures which Freud believed due to phylogenetic inheritance12 and which have been 11.

E., xvn, 97:</page><page sequence="7">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 227 shown by Laplanche and Pontalis to be ontogenetic dramatizations of origin or emergence;13 (2) to characterize "The Sensitive Plant," like the related myth of the expulsion from Eden, as a fantasy of origins, i.e., the origin of desire and of the subject as a result of loss, and the original symbiotic state, forever lost but forever possessed as unconscious object of desire. II The interpretation of "The Sensitive Plant" which I will pro pose may be summarized most succinctly as follows: the Sensitive Plant is situated on the boundary between symbiosis and indi viduation, able to perceive the state it desires but totally lacking and totally desiring; the flowers of the Garden are the representa tions of the state to which the Sensitive Plant aspires; the Lady of the Garden is a composite symbiotic mother and sexual object; her death is the end of symbiosis; and the Conclusion expresses the belief that this death is an illusion, that somehow the combination of symbiotic and erotic desires, which cannot die in the uncon scious, will be fulfilled. Turning now to the details of the poem, it is appropriate, I think, to begin with the question of its structure; and it may be helpful, if anticipatory, to note that the basic constituent unit of the poem's structure is the number seven. There are seventy-seven stanzas, the seventy-seventh line, as we shall see, is of central importance, and the entire poem is organized on the basis of seven-stanza units. I would suggest as an a priori hypothesis, which I think will be vali dated in the details of the poem, that the source (whether conscious or unconscious) of this emphasis on the number seven is the seven days of Creation in the myth of Genesis, which is itself an account of the human individual's expulsion from a symbiotic paradise. The myth of Genesis is a myth of origins, not only of the human race but of death and desire as well, and the poem of Shelley is a fantasy on precisely the same subject, a poem of origins, an original fantasy. The formal structure of Part First, which, like Part Third, has twenty-eight stanzas, is quite clear: it is divided exactly in half, not "These scenes of observing parental intercourse, of being seduced in child hood, and of being threatened with castration are unquestionably an inherited endowment, a phylogenetic heritage." 13.

And the Spring arose on the garden fair, 5 Like the Spirit of Love felt everywhere; And each flower and herb on Earth's dark breast Rose from the dreams of its wintry rest. But none ever trembled and panted with bliss In the garden, the field, or the wilderness, 10 Like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want, As the companionless Sensitive Plant. The snowdrop, and then the violet, Arose from the ground with warm rain wet, And their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sent 15 From the turf, like the voice and the instrument. Then the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall, And narcissi, the fairest among them all, Who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess, Till they die of their own dear loveliness; 20 And the Naiad-like lily of the vale, Whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale That the light of its tremulous bells is seen Through their pavilions of tender green; And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue, 25 Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew Of music so delicate, soft, and intense, It was felt like an odour within the sense; And from this undented Paradise The flowers (as an infant's awakening eyes Smile on its mother, whose singing sweet 60 Can first lull, and at last must awaken it), When Heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them, As mine-lamps enkindle a hidden gem, Shone smiling to Heaven, and every one Shared joy in the light of the gentle sun; 65 For each one was interpenetrated With the light and the odour its neighbour shed, Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear Wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere. But the Sensitive Plant which could give small fruit 70 Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root, Received more than all, it loved more than ever, Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver,?

CALDWELL only by the presence of an extra line in stanzas 14 and 28, but also by the opposition in content between the two halves. This contrast may be grasped most easily by arranging Part First in two parallel columns; we may thereby examine each stanza both in the context of what precedes and follows it in the poem, and also in compari son with its counterpart in the other half of Part First (see pp. 228-229). Thus the description of the Sensitive Plant's situation in the Gar den, in stanzas 1-3, is balanced by the description of the flowers' situation in the Garden, in stanzas 15-17; the catalogue of the flowers in the seven stanzas 4-10 is balanced by the portrayal of the Sensitive Plant and the listing of the sources of its pleasure in stanzas 18-24; the peaceful stanzas (11-14) which end the first half conclude with evening and the flowers' sleep (55-57), while the last four stanzas of Part First depict the descent of evening and the dream-engendering sleep of the Sensitive Plant. In the first stanza, which begins as if a myth were about to be told, we may recognize intimations of the relationship between mother and child. The Sensitive Plant grew, it was fed with the dew, it opened its leaves, as if they were eyes, to the light, it was lulled to sleep with kisses at night. The relation between the Sensi tive Plant, which may be seen as still in a symbiotic state, and its environment is characterized by perfect mutuality: it opens and closes its leaves in response to loving stimuli, it grows as it is fed? and we should note that the light which opens the eyes of the Sensitive Plant in the first stanza of the poem will return in the last stanza of the Conclusion as that which the Sensitive Plant knew in its origin but which now exceeds the powers of con scious perception, persisting nevertheless in a mode beyond con sciousness. The counterpart of the first stanza is the fifteenth, in which the Garden is identified as Paradise (and we know at this point that the flowers' mother will be Eve). The parenthesis in this stanza explicitly refers to the relationship between mother and infant, and corresponding to the opening and closing of the Sensitive Plant's leaves is the opening of an infant's eyes and the account of the flower /infants lulled and awakened by their mother's singing. On the level of the flowers, the awakening is to post-natal exis tence, the symbiotic paradise; but in the literal terms of the simile, the finality of "at last must awaken it" (61) suggests that the mother's singing (and music is a constant metaphor for desired</page><page sequence="11">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 231 beauty in Shelley's poetry) will eventually awaken the infant to a new perception, that the object of desire is separate from the self. But, as we see in stanzas 16 and 17, this is not yet the final awakening; it is still what we might term the inscription of sym biotic memory-traces. The "blithe winds" which unfold the flowers recall the "young winds" of the first stanza and the open ing of the Sensitive Plant's leaves. Again mutuality (or, we might say, homeostatic equilibrium) is emphasized: by the mine-lamps' light which generates the nascent glow of a hidden gem, by the sharing of joy and the interpenetration of pleasure. As the Lady of the Garden has not yet appeared, the symbiotic union (which, as we have seen, is fundamentally the relationship between two halves of the self) appears in the quasi-sexual union of the flowers. That they are "wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere" (69) reminds me of Mahler's statement that "the infant behaves and functions as though he and his mother were an omnipotent system (a dual unity) within one common boundary (a symbiotic membrane, as it were)."14 Returning to the first three stanzas (which correspond to stanzas 15-17), we see that the coming of Spring arouses the flowers from their dreams of wintry rest, a transition from antenatal existence to birth into symbiotic life. The reference to "Earth's dark breast" suggests a maternal ambience, a mother-child relationship, and we may also note that the birth of the flowers is subsequent to the birth of the Sensitive Plant. That the Sensitive Plant represents a further stage of development, at the moment of individuation, is made clear in the third stanza, in which it is completely set apart from the flowers by virtue of its desire. The Sensitive Plant's de sire, particularized as an erotic desire by the reference to the doe at noontide, springs, as does all desire, from absence, shown here by the mention of "love's sweet want" (11) and by the significant characterization of the Sensitive Plant as "companionless." This desire, based on absence and associated with the beginning of eroticism and sexuality, is in sharp opposition to the flowers' state of total interpenetrating presence, as seen in stanza 17, the counter part to stanza 3. In the remainder of the first half of Part First, we may note the 14. Margaret Mahler, On Human Symbiosis and the Vicissitudes of Individua tion (New York: International Universities Press, 1968), i, 35.</page><page sequence="12">232 RICHARD S. CALDWELL occurrence of a temporal condensation: what begins as a season (Spring) with a naturalistic recitation of the flowers in the order of their actual appearance becomes a lifetime (birth, youth, prime, decline) and then a single day which seems co-existent with the flowers (at evening, the drooping day is equivalent to the droop ing flowers [55]). The season of a lifetime, of childhood, of the flowers, is reduced to a single day. In the fourth stanza, once again the idea of mutuality is stressed: the flowers and the wet ground, the flowers' breath and the turf's odor, the voice and the musical instrument. But the idea of mutu ality is undercut, or rather given a new meaning, in the fifth stanza by reference to the narcissus which, like the poet of "Alastor," seeking an ideal likeness of himself, is in love with itself and thus with death; for death is the only possible fulfillment of the desire not to desire, the longing for re-fusion with the lost part of the self. In the self-love of the narcissi we may see a reference to the nar cissism of symbiosis; since there is no other, but only the self, all love is self-love and in their passionate interpenetration the flowers are in love with themselves. Loss of this state is loss of the Other, but simultaneously the discovery of the Other, a discovery which is only made possible by its absence. It is this state of discovery, of individuation and desire, which characterizes the Sensitive Plant, and the contrast between it and the flowers is seen most clearly in the structural intersection of stanzas 3, 4, 17, and 18: the com panionless, desiring Sensitive Plant is opposed to the interpene trating mutuality of the flowers; the response of the flowers' breath to the turf's odor is opposed to the Sensitive Plant who cannot give but can only receive, who, as we see at the end of stanza 18, is the only resident of the Garden who wants, and whose want is in exhaustible. The antithesis between the want of the Sensitive Plant and the mutual narcissism of the flowers is repeated, even more strongly, in the contrast between the narcissi and it in stanzas 5 and 19, a contrast between the individuated subject defined by total absence (without flower, radiance, or odor, 74-75) and by desire for "what it has not" (77), and the symbiotic asubjective infant who can take only what it regards as itself for its object. And we might recall that Freud's term for the earliest psychic state of the individual was "primary narcissism." That which the Sensitive Plant desires and has not is "the</page><page sequence="13">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT': ORIGINAL FANTASY 233 Beautiful" (77). Whatever Platonic connotations this may have, the Idea of Beauty which it represents lies beyond experiential con sciousness or intellectual perception, the archetype of love and gratification existing eternally in the human unconscious. The connection between desire and absence is emphasized by the obvi ous reference to Diotima's instruction of Socrates in 76 (the Sensi tive Plant "loves, even like Love" and is thus likened to Eros, who desires only what he has not and is characterized by total poverty and lack) and by the fact that the crucial statement, "It desires what it has not, the Beautiful!", occurs in line 77 of the seventy seven-stanza poem.15 The personification of the flowers as characters from Greek myth continues with the Naiad-like lily of the vale, the hyacinth, the rose nymph, and the Maenad-lily (stanzas 6-9). In stanzas 4, 5, 7, and 9 we find in the mythical allusions a combination of beauty as the object of desire and death as its outcome: the violet sprang from the blood of Attis, who in Ovid's account castrated himself to be free of desire; the wind-flower, or anemone, grew from the blood of Adonis, over whom Aphrodite and Persephone fought; Narcissus, loved by Echo in vain, died of his own self-love; Hyacinthus, loved by Boreas and Apollo, was killed by the jealousy of Boreas and the discus of Apollo; the Maenads killed Orpheus because of his indif ference to their charms. In stanzas 6 and 8 we have, first, the lily of the vale compared to a Naiad, one of the innumerable beautiful nymphs of streams and springs (such as Echo, the Naiad who loved Narcissus), and secondly, the rose compared to a nymph at her bath in a stanza whose syntax seems overcome by its sensuality. In this exquisitely anthropomorphic portrayal of the Garden's flowers, we have two implications presented in virtual stanzaic alternation: first, that the state of zero desire is connected with death, as exemplified best in the death of Narcissus; second, that the object of desire (including the desire of the Sensitive Plant, already sexualized by the reference in the third stanza to its trembling and panting like the doe in the noontide, i.e., in heat), is, if not the narcissistic mirror-image, the unclothed female body. Consider not only the naked nymph and the unveiled breast, but also that the (Platonic?) soul of beauty and love is laid bare "fold after fold" by the removal of petals' clothing; and recall that 15. Note also that only this stanza, in the narrative section of the poem, is in the present tense (as is the Conclusion).</page><page sequence="14">234 RICHARD S. CALDWELL Shelley, as his friend Hogg tells us, had "read more Greek than many an aged pedant,"16 a fact which attaches special meaning to the multiple signification of the Greek word nymphe (nymph, bride, opening rosebud, spring, clitoris), as well as that of rhodon (rose, female genitals). The eroticization of the personified flowers is guaranteed, of course, by the entire literary and mythical tradition which portrays these flowers and the garden as the natural site of both blissful innocence and heightened sensuality, a tradition intensified by the romantic poets' use of mythology and of literary prototypes such as Spenser's Garden of Adonis, but also a tradition which goes back to the earliest Greek poetry. For example, in a fragment of the lost epic Cypria preserved by Athenaeus, Aphrodite's clothing is said to consist of crocus, hyacinth, violet, rose, narcissus, and lily. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Persephone is gathering roses, crocuses, violets, irises, hyacinths, and narcissi when she is carried off by Pluto, a list which comes even closer to Shelley's in the explanation which she gives to her mother of what she had been doing: she was gathering crocuses, irises, hyacinths, roses, lilies, and narcissi. When Zeus enticed Europa by changing into a white bull and breathing a crocus from his mouth, she was picking flowers in a meadow (a rose garden, according to Apollodorus); as A. M. Dale has rightly said, picking flowers in a meadow is the standard occu pation of the ravished maidens of antiquity.17 Finally, it should be noted that Freud found the imagery used by poets repeated in the dreams and fantasies he encountered in his clinical work. As he observes, gardens are "a frequently recurring symbol of the female genitalia" and "blossoms and flowers represent the female sexual organs, more particularly, in virginity"18?a symbolism which be comes virtually a poetic genre. After the contrast between narcissistic satiety and the emptiness which generates desire in stanzas 5 and 19, stanzas 6-9, each of which contains the description of a single personified flower, are linked with stanzas 20-23, which portray the vehicles of the Sensitive Plant's joy. The instruments of its pleasure are the winds, the beams, the insects, the dew, and the vapors of mid-day; and that 16.

The winds, which touched the Sensitive Plant (2) and the Garden's flowers (62), carry music, recalling the earlier "instru ment" (16) and "music" (27), as well as the mother's "singing" (60). The beams of light, which have their source in a flower's "star," recollect the lily of the vale's "light" (23) and the lily's "star" (35), as well as the interpenetration of the flowers by each other's "light" (67) and the Sensitive Plant's response to "light" (3) and lack of "radiance" (75); these beams bear the flowers' "hues," recalling not only the "tangled hue" (44) but also all the mentions of the flowers' colors (24, 25, 34, 43, 56). The insects, "like golden boats on a sunny sea" (83), bring to the Sensitive Plant both "light and odour" (84), recalling the frequent mention of both attractions and especially their specific combination two and four stanzas earlier: "light and odour" characterize the flowers' interpenetration in stanza 17, "radiance and odour" are what the Sensitive Plant lacks in stanza 19 and so must receive from the insects in stanza 21. The unseen dew, "like fire in the flowers" (87), which fed the Sensitive Plant (2), recalls also the "clear dew" through which the "fiery star" of the lily gazed (35-36), and is the bearer of both light and fragrance. Finally, all attractions, "sound and odour and beam" (92), are carried "as reeds in a single stream" (93) by the "quivering vapours of dim noontide" (90). These "quivering vapours" at "noontide" are a clear echo of the trembling of the "doe in the noontide" (11); the vapors which envelop sound, odor, and light are charged with the same erotic excitation as was attributed to the Sensitive Plant by the simile of the third stanza. The parallel is appropriate, since the vapors, like the winds, light, insects, and dew, are the instruments and emis saries of the Sensitive Plant's desire, of "love's sweet want" (ll).19 19. That these function as emissaries of the Sensitive Plant's desire, despite the fact that they come to rather than from it (the Sensitive Plant can be only a recipient, never a donor), is suggested by the frequent occurrence of all? winds, light, insects, dew, vapors?as phallic and seminal symbols in myth, poetry, and folk custom. From the many legends of the impregnating ability of the wind, the one most apt is the story told in Ovid's Fasti (5.195-202) of the ravishing of Flora by Zephyrus (i.e., of Flower by Wind). For the procreative power of rays of light and vapors, see the many examples in Ernest Jones, "The Conception of the Madonna through the Ear" in his Essays in Applied Psychoanalysis (London: Hogarth Press, 1923). Insects are, of course, a common phallic symbol (cf. the relation between honeybees and flowers), and the dew</page><page sequence="16">236 RICHARD S. CALDWELL In the tenth stanza, the idea that the Garden is Eden and the allegorical universality of the poem are strengthened by the con clusion of the catalogue of flowers, "And all rare blossoms from every clime / Grew in that garden in perfect prime" (39-40), an inclusive summary which corresponds with the first two lines of the 24th stanza, "Each and all like ministering angels were / For the Sensitive Plant sweet joy to bear" (94-95). In these summations, we may see again the mythic tone with which the poem began and also a contrast between the immediacy and totality of the flowers' presence to themselves in the Garden and the Sensitive Plant's total dependence on the Other for the fulfillment of its desire and the mediation of its lack. The "ministering angels" which serve the Sensitive Plant are, most simply, the connecting link between the Sensitive Plant and the flowers;20 they are the point of contact and mediation, the aerial stream which carries desire toward its fulfillment, the stream on which, as Asia says, "the boat of my desire is guided" (Pro metheus Unbound, n.v.94). Parallel to the many rivers and streams on which Shelley's poet-heroes sail in search of the lost meaning, and object, and source of desire are these streams of the air, which bear in this instance not the mobile desirer toward his stationary object but rather the transportable object toward the necessarily stationary desirer (we could, after all, hardly imagine the Sensitive Plant uprooting itself and sailing off in a shallop). Thus it is fitting that in the last phrase of stanza 23, the con clusion of the catalogue from "light winds" to "quivering vapours," the ensemble of delights which awaken the desire of the Sensitive Plant is compared to "reeds in a single stream" (93), the stream on which its desire is carried. The stream has been encountered earlier in the poem, in the eleventh and twelfth stanzas, and we may now turn to these. Again we find a description of natural beauty eroticized by the interplay of images, associations, and references to shares with rain the function of coming from the sky to fertilize the earth; see Hazel Barnes, The Meddling Gods (Lincoln: U. of Nebraska Press, 1974), p. 102. But it may be misleading, and it is certainly not crucial, to regard these phenomena as phallic; what is important and, I think, clear is that they are the signifiers, the concrete manifestations, of the Sensitive Plant's desire, and the fact that they go to and not from the Sensitive Plant indicates that desire originates in the lost object. 20. What, I might ask parenthetically, is the connecting link between desire and its object, if not phallic?</page><page sequence="17">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 237 other parts of the poem. The central characteristics encompassing the ideal state of the flowers (light and hue, sound and radiance, blossoms and stars) constitute the ambience of the stream's "dance" (47); and the stream itself, like the flowers before, is personified in female form, not only by its possession of an "inconstant bosom" (41), by being "pranked" (42) with light as a woman is with cosmetics and jewelry, and by its dance (47), but more subtly by reference to the water-lilies which "lay tremulously" (45) upon it. We saw earlier that the Greek word nymphe means, among other things, an attractive and sometimes passionate female, rosebud, water (especially of a stream or spring), and clitoris. We may now note that the Greek word for water-lily is nymphaia, and we may infer one of three things: Shelley is consciously exploiting his knowledge of Greek etymology for poetic purposes, or (and I would think this more likely) the same unconscious metonymic and metaphoric associations which pushed this cluster of meanings into the Greek language is operative in Shelley's unconscious as well, or this is all sheer coincidence. That the last is unlikely would seem to me to be indicated by what it is that the water-lilies are doing: they "lay tremulously" on the stream, and their tremulousness reminds me of a connected imagistic series of sexual excitation. The Sensitive Plant "trembled . . . Like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want" (9-11), there were the "tremulous" (23) bells of the passionate lily of the vale, the "quivering vapours of dim noon tide" (90) contained the objects of the Sensitive Plant's desire, and, most significantly, the Lady of the Garden will reveal both her own desire and its gratification by "her tremulous breath" (2.14). The vision of the stream, an ambivalent image which is both phallic insinuation and feminine anticipation, an image which is one of a series of transformations of the objects of the Sensitive Plant's desire and of that desire itself, is a miniature world under its heaven of assonant "boughs of embowering blossom" (42); it is, as it were, the self-enclosed fantasy of the Sensitive Plant. In the corresponding stanzas (25 and 26) that world is enlarged and the conditions of fantasy formation more fully portrayed. The limits of the new world are Heaven above and Earth below, and in this world are included the Sensitive Plant, the beasts, the birds, the insects?but not, it seems, the flowers. This is the world of those who seek, and are not themselves, the objects of their desire; and the conditions by which this quest may be fulfilled are clearly stated: love and dreams. The tenebrous atmosphere conducive to both</page><page sequence="18">238 RICHARD S. CALDWELL is described in a succession of short clauses joined by and in stanza 25. The descent of Evening from Heaven to an Earth which is still in expectation, through air which is itself "all love" (99), bringing delight "far more deep" (100), is reminiscent of the famous fragment (fr. 125Mette) of Aeschylus' lost Danaides, in which Aphrodite says that it is Eros which impels Heaven to penetrate Earth and which leads Earth to anticipate this union. But cosmic passion is merely the setting for the real act of wish fulfillment, the coming of sleep and the dreams which affect consciousness but cannot be known by it (104-105), the "ocean of dreams" (103) which surrounds our waking life with visions of pleasure. And, contrary to the suppositions of waking life, this world of dreams is the real world; the daylight of consciousness is a "veil" (101) which conceals the realm of dreams. In this unconscious world, our real desires are fulfilled, and the nature of both desire and fulfillment is sug gested more precisely by the associations attached to the separating veil. That the unveiled world of dreams is the repository of sexual desire is indicated, first, by that which is "unveiled" (30) in the description of the rose: the depth of a nymph's "glowing breast" and the bare "soul of her beauty and love"; and second, by the "veil of daylight" (2.20) which conceals from the passionate Lady of the Garden the object of her passion. In the thirteenth stanza, the metaphoric stream has been trans formed into "sinuous paths" which also wind through the Garden and its delights. The equation of stream and paths is reinforced by the repetition of "boughs of embowering blossom" (42) as "bowers of blossoming trees" (52), but the equation is not exact; for a note of fragility and the possibility of loss is introduced, first ever so slightly, by the alternating presence and absence of the paths them selves, second, by reference to the "fabulous asphodels" (54), flowers of Elysium and of death, third, by the "flow'rets" (55) which droop as day droops and will die when the day of their season dies, and fourth, by reference in the fifth line of the fourteenth stanza, the last line of the first half of Part First, to the existence in the Garden of a vulnerable creature, the glow-worm, which must be protected against the "evening dew" (the dew which brings life in Part First, death in Part Third), a creature which shares the radiance of the flowers but only, it seems, as a kind of inherited reflection from the flowers which shelter it. Its glow depends upon the protective roof of flowers, and it begins to shine only when the flowers have ceased to shine. We may note, in these last four stanzas of the first half, a</page><page sequence="19">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 239 progression from the stream, dancing in light and shadow under a heaven of many colors, to the paths, sometimes open to the sun, sometimes lost amid flowering trees, to finally the glow-worm, whose world is contracted to the roof of many-colored flowers above and whose light is on loan from the lightless flowers at night. The counterpart to the glow-worm is the Sensitive Plant, whose dreams and sleep are described in the last two stanzas of Part First; and the counterpart to the asphodels is the nightingale's "Elysian chant" (108), mixed with the dreams of the Sensitive Plant. As the light of the flowers becomes the nighttime possession of the glow worm, it is only at night that the Sensitive Plant comes into full realization of its desires. Again there is a tripartite progression of the dimensions of the world in question: corresponding to heaven, trees, and flowery roof is Heaven above (98), nightingale overhead (106), and finally the enfolding embrace of Night (114). Yet the nightingale is also analogous to the glow-worm, for it "Ever sang more sweet as the day might fail" (107); the end of day and of the flowers' radiance is the beginning of the nightingale's song and the glow-worm's light. But this song itself is Elysian; like the asphodels, it signifies both Paradise and the underworld, both love and death, the persistence of beauty in a life beyond consciousness. Stanza 28, like stanza 15, is an overt representation of the rela tionship between an infant and mother. On one level it represents the setting and condition of the child's (or the Sensitive Plant's) rest and dreams; on another level it is the dream itself, a timeless vision of absolute bliss, the only Paradise there is: a child exhausted by its joys, like the drooping flow'rets, totally reliant on its mother's love, embraced by Night, the mother of dreams and of us all. Ill I will deal much more briefly with the structure and interpreta tion of the rest of the poem. The structural pattern of Parts Second and Third is, like that of Part First, based upon the combination of seven-stanza units; the deviation from this pattern in the six-stanza Conclusion is pre figured by an alternate structure in Part Second. Part Second can be seen as composed of two seven-stanza units, the first portraying the Lady and her relationship with a "bright Spirit" and the grass on which she walks, and the second dealing with her relation to the flowers and the insects, followed by a single stanza announcing, in the last word of Part Second, her death and the end of summer.</page><page sequence="20">240 RICHARD S. CALDWELL Part Third has 28 stanzas, just as Part First, and the dominant units are again groups of seven stanzas, not arranged mechanically but clearly the structural basis of organization. Corresponding to the seven-stanza units in Part First describing the flowers (4-10) and the Sensitive Plant and its delights (18-24), Part Third has seven stanzas describing the effect of Autumn on the plants (6-12), seven stanzas on the emergence of weeds and poisonous elements (13-19), and seven stanzas on Winter and its effects (22-28). The six stanzas of the Conclusion form what seems to be a new pattern, three pairs of stanzas dealing, respectively, with the Sensi tive Plant and the Lady, the prevalence of uncertainty and illusion in life, and the denial of death and change for the Garden and Lady in particular, for love and beauty and delight in general. This triple structure, however, has been intimated earlier, for the fifteen stanzas of Part Second may be regarded as falling into three sections of five stanzas apiece, the first dealing with the Lady and her Spirit, the second with the Lady and the various plants, and the third with the Lady and the good and bad insects (see p. 241). There seems to be an abrupt shift from the end of Part First to the beginning of Part Second, from the sleep and dreams of the Sensitive Plant to the announcement of "a Power in this sweet place, / an Eve in this Eden"?until, that is, we remember that "this Eden" is precisely the source and subject of the Sensitive Plant's dreams. I would suggest, in fact, that Part Second is perhaps best interpreted as a dream, that dream which the Sensitive Plant commenced at the end of Part First, that dream which will appear in line 12 of the Conclusion as the substance of which our lives are but a shadow. Wasserman notes that "the central subject of the poem is the Sensitive Plant, and around it everything revolves, even in the second and third parts of the fable, where, paradoxically, it hardly appears at all."21 But in fact the Sensitive Plant appears in Part Third almost as much as in Part First, whereas it is totally absent from Part Second, a situation which makes good unpara doxical sense if we regard Part Second as its dream of maternal nurture and desire gratified. It is a dream of Paradise and a Lady, of Eden and Eve: of sym biosis and the mother, who nurses the flowers as if they "had been her own infants" (39). But it is what we might call a "retroactive fantasy," containing post-symbiotic aspects as well; as has been fore 21. Wasserman, p. 157.</page><page sequence="21">PART SECOND There was a Power in this sweet place, An Eve in this Eden; a ruling Grace Which to the flowers, did they waken or dream, Was as God is to the starry scheme. A Lady, the wonder of her kind, 5 Whose form was upborne by a lovely mind Which, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion Like a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean, Tended the garden from morn to even: And the meteors of that sublunar Heaven, 10 Like the lamps of the air when Night walks forth, Laughed round her footsteps up from the Earth! She had no companion of mortal race, But her tremulous breath and her flushing face Told, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes, 15 That her dreams were less slumber than Paradise: As if some bright Spirit for her sweet sake Had deserted Heaven while the stars were awake, As if yet around her he lingering were, Though the veil of daylight concealed him from her. 20 Her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed; You might hear by the heaving of her breast, That the coming and going of the wind Brought pleasure there and left passion behind. And wherever her aery footstep trod, 25 Her trailing hair from the grassy sod Erased its light vestige, with shadowy sweep, Like a sunny storm o'er the dark green deep. I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet; SO I doubt not they felt the spirit that came From her glowing fingers through all their frame. She sprinkled bright water from the stream On those that were faint with the sunny beam; And out of the cups of the heavy flowers 35 She emptied the rain of the thunder-showers. She lifted their heads with her tender hands, And sustained them with rods and osier-bands; If the flowers had been her own infants, she Could never have nursed them more tenderly. 40 And all killing insects and gnawing worms, And things of obscene and unlovely forms, She bore, in a basket of Indian woof, Into the rough woods far aloof,? In a basket, of grasses and wild-flowers full, 45 The freshest her gentle hands could pull For the poor banished insects, whose intent, Although they did ill, was innocent. But the bee and the beamlike ephemeris Whose path is the lightning's, and soft moths that kiss 50 The sweet lips of the flowers, and harm not, did she Make her attendant angels be. And many an antenatal tomb, Where butterflies dream of the life to come, She left clinging round the smooth and dark 55 Edge of the odorous cedar bark. This fairest creature from earliest Spring Thus moved through the garden ministering All the sweet season of Summertide, And ere the first leaf looked brown?she died! 60 A x w en W Z en H &lt; W f &gt; z H O O Z &gt; r 52 z en K&gt;</page><page sequence="22">242 RICHARD S. CALDWELL shadowed by the prevalent erotic imagery of Part First, the desires of the Sensitive Plant are not only for nurture and care, but for sexual fulfillment as well. And this is what we would expect in a retroactive fantasy, since symbiotic bliss is the prototype and model not only of mythical and literary versions of a past Golden Age forever lost, but also of the unalloyed pleasure we seek, and rarely find, in love and the sexual act, the closest approximation to loss of the self in union with another that is possible for the post-symbiotic individual. In symbiosis there is no other; the other is part of the self, and the self is the world. Thus the search for symbiosis is an attempt to recover a lost part of the self, an effort to achieve perfect mutu ality of love and gratification. But in the fantasy of desire there must always be an Other, since this fantasy presupposes the exis tence of something lacking to the separate self; this Other will therefore exemplify sometimes maternal affection, sometimes erotic attractiveness, sometimes identity with the desiring subject, de pending on which stage is dominant in the "layered" fantasy. It sometimes occurs in Shelley's poems that the maternal character istics of the desired object are overtly lacking or even, perhaps, vehemently denied. But it is these very instances which I would regard as the most fundamental and thoroughgoing symbiotic fantasies; for in them desire for maternal nurture has been replaced by longing for fusion with the desired object, and the object itself turns out to be the mirror image (i.e., the lost half) of the self. Thus is revealed both the wish to escape the limitations of Carte sian individuation and also the fantasy's basis in the primary narcissism which is a leading characteristic of infantile life. The search for an ideal woman who is both supremely desirable and also, in some way, identical with the subject himself is, of course, a major theme in Shelley's works, perhaps best seen in "Alastor" and "Epipsychidion." In the latter, Emilia Viviani is called "this soul out of my soul" (238) and is bid "Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united / Even as a bride, delighting and delighted" (392 93); and the moment of physical consummation is pictured in words that recall the myth of Aristophanes: We shall become the same, we shall be one Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, Till like two meteors of expanding flame,</page><page sequence="23">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 243 Those spheres instinct with it become the same, Touch, mingle, are transfigured .. .22 (573-78) In "Alastor," which Shelley himself called the mind's "thirst for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself," the ideal woman appears as a "veiled maid" in the dream of the Poet. "Her voice was like the voice of his own soul" (153), she is "Herself a poet" (161); inflamed by their mutual verses, she drew back, then "With frantic gesture and short breathless cry / Folded his frame in her dis solving arms" (186-87). In this vision of passion and identity, the possibility of a maternal factor is displaced (by what in dream analysis is known as decomposition) onto the mysterious figure who immediately precedes the appearance of the veiled maiden, an "Arab maiden" who brings the Poet food, makes his bed, tends his steps, and watches over him while he sleeps?in short, is the em bodiment of maternal care. To return to "The Sensitive Plant," all three aspects of the retroactive symbiotic fantasy appear, a configuration made possible by the allegorical nature of the poem and by its cross-referenced allusions. The maternal nature of the Lady is clear from explicit references and from her nurture of the flowers. Her attractiveness and passionate nature are equally clear, especially as described in the first six stanzas of Part Second. As for her identity with the Sensitive Plant (as Emilia V. with Shelley, or the "veiled maiden" with the Poet), each line of the fourth stanza of Part Second re veals this: the identifying feature of the Sensitive Plant is that it is "companionless" (1.12), and the Lady "had no companion" (2.13); the Sensitive Plant "trembled and panted with bliss" (1.9) and the Lady's passion is revealed by "her tremulous breath" (2.14); the Sensitive Plant went to sleep "beneath the kisses of Night" (1.4) and the Lady awoke when "the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes" (2.15); the dreams of the Sensitive Plant were mixed with the nightingale's "Elysian chant" (1.108) and the Lady's "dreams were less slumber than Paradise" (2.16). There is but one connection more that needs to be made, not only in accordance with the analytic principle that the dreamer 22. Since it is hardly likely that the object of this passion could be regarded as maternal, I am tempted to view Shelley's rather gratuitous reference in line 18 to the "unmaternal nest" of Emily's "wounded breast" as a compulsive denial of that which is successfully repressed elsewhere in the poetic fantasy.</page><page sequence="24">244 RICHARD S. CALDWELL must somehow appear in his dream, but also because the eroticized symbiotic fantasy corresponds fully to the desire of the Sensitive Plant. I would suggest that the "bright Spirit" who embraces the Lady at night and remains with her during the day, although con cealed by "the veil of daylight" (20), is the dream representation of the Sensitive Plant, the fantasy fulfillment of its desire.23 In its most direct form, the dream of the Sensitive Plant is of being the lover who appears in the dream of the Lady it loves. Because of the direct presence of the Lady in Part Second, there is no need for a repetition of Part First's elaborate lists and descrip tions of the flowers, whose status (as we now see, of being cared for by the Lady) the Sensitive Plant wished to attain. Indeed, the name of no specific flower appears in Part Second; there are only gen eralized references to "flowers." Specificity and detail are reserved for the grass and stream, earlier representations, because of their sinuous contact with the flowers, of the Sensitive Plant's desire and now the elements which come into contact with the Lady's step and touch; and for the instrumental signifiers of the Sensitive Plant's desire, the wind which brings pleasure and leaves passion (24) and the insects, which were included among the Sensitive Plant's "ministering angels" (1.94) and are now the Lady's "at tendant angels" (2.52). Those insects who are "attendant angels" recall the role of the insects in Part First; there are some creatures, however, described quite pejoratively in lines 41-42, which cannot participate in the Paradisal vision and are banished by the Lady. But she carries them off in a basket full of grasses and wild-flowers, and they are found not guilty of wrongdoing; their "intent, / Although they did ill, was innocent" (47-48). The fate of these exiled insects prefigures that of the Sensitive Plant, who in Part Third will be banished from the Garden which has perished around him, and will weep "like one forbid" (3.78), and is analogous to the general human condition of which the poem is an allegory, a condition of exile from an earlier state. The primal state is irrecoverable and the exile is irreversible, but that the memory of an earlier life somehow 23. There is verbal support for this view: the word Spirit (with upper-case S) occurs three times in the poem, once in each of the three Parts; in Part First, the "Spirit of Love" is "felt everywhere" (6) and the Sensitive Plant "loves, even like Love" (76); in Part Second, the Spirit is the lover of the Lady's dreams; and in the Conclusion of Part Third the soul of the Sensitive Plant is "like a Spirit" (115).</page><page sequence="25">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 245 remains is deftly suggested here by the grasses and wild-flowers from the Garden which accompany the "poor banished insects" into exile. How might we explain the peculiar reversal in line 54 of Part Second? That is, why is it butterflies, and not chrysalides, which in "many an antenatal tomb . . . dream of the life to come"? A possible answer which, I imagine, would satisfy the Sensitive Plant, is that you are what you dream24?the worm who dreams of being a butterfly is in fact already a butterfly. Both the incident and this interpretation are instances of the larger series of transformations which control the poem: the life which begins upon expulsion from the Garden is, as Adam and Eve learned, a function of death; "nothing is, but all things seem," as we will learn in the Conclusion (124); and the reality of men, as "the shadows of the dream" (3.125), is not their conscious perceptions of what they call reality, but rather the dimly and sporadically recognized fantasies and desires of which their dreams are made. With the last word of Part Second, the dream has become a nightmare. In the terms of our interpretation, the death of the Lady of the Garden represents the momentary loss, or absence, of the mother, the single condition for the establishment of the indi vidual subject with all the desire, the estrangement, and the aliena tion which will accompany all of life. In fact, as we have seen, the Sensitive Plant has been situated at the mythical point of indi viduation since the third stanza of the poem. But whereas all of the poem thus far represents the positive dimension of the fantasy which is both caused by, and seeks to overcome, individuation, Part Third portrays the negative dimension: the brutal facts of loss and separation, the pain and isolation ordained by individual existence, the irreversibility of the death of the symbiotic Garden (see pp. 246-247). For three days after the Lady's death, the flowers wait in dim and obscure anticipation?for what? We naturally assume that the specific passage of three days after death signifies an imminent resurrection, but on the fourth day "the Sensitive Plant / Felt the sound of the funeral chant" (5-6). There has been, in fact, a rebirth; but it is the birth of the individuated subject, a rebirth into the aloneness of post-symbiotic life. 24. This is almost (but not quite) the same as Wasserman's statement that "The imaginative dreams that come to earthly man in his entombment in the senses divulge the pure fullness of what he is in essence" (p. 176).</page><page sequence="26">PART THIRD Three days the flowers of the garden fair, Like stars when the moon is awakened, were, Or the waves of Baiae, ere luminous She floats up through the smoke of Vesuvius. And on the fourth, the Sensitive Plant 5 Felt the sound of the funeral chant, And the steps of the bearers, heavy and slow, And the sobs of the mourners, deep and low; The weary sound and the heavy breath, And the silent motions of passing death, 10 And the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank, Sent through the pores of the coffin-plank; The dark grass, and the flowers among the grass, Were bright with tears as the crowd did pass; From their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone, 15 And sate in the pines, and gave groan for groan. The garden, once fair, became cold and foul, Like the corpse of her who had been its soul, Which at first was lovely as if in sleep, Then slowly changed, till it grew a heap 20 To make men tremble who never weep. Swift Summer into the Autumn flowed, And frost in the mist of the morning rode, Though the noonday sun looked clear and bright, Mocking the spoil of the secret night. 25 The rose-leaves, like flakes of crimson snow, Paved the turf and the moss below, The lilies were drooping, and white, and wan, Like the head and the skin of a dying man. And plants, at whose names the verse feels loath, Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth, Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue, 60 Livid, and starred with a lurid dew. And agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould Started like mist from the wet ground cold; Pale, fleshy, as if the decaying dead With a spirit of growth had been animated! 65 Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum, Made the running rivulet thick and dumb, And at its outlet flags huge as stakes Dammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes. And hour by hour, when the air was still, 70 The vapours arose which have strength to kill; At morn they were seen, at noon they were felt, At night they were darkness no star could melt. And unctuous meteors from spray to spray Crept and flitted in broad noonday 75 Unseen; every branch on which they alit By a venomous blight was burned and bit. The Sensitive Plant, like one forbid, Wept, and the tears within each lid Of its folded leaves, which together grew, 80 Were changed to a blight of frozen glue. For the leaves soon fell, and the branches soon By the heavy axe of the blast were hewn; The sap shrank to the root through every pore As blood to a heart that will beat no more. 85 o 35 &gt; O n &gt; r o w r r</page><page sequence="27">And Indian plants, of scent and hue 30 The sweetest that ever were fed on dew, Leaf by leaf, day after day, Were massed into the common clay.

And the gusty winds waked the winged seeds, Out of their birthplace of ugly weeds, Till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem, 40 Which rotted into the earth with them. The water-blooms under the rivulet Fell from the stalks on which they were set; And the eddies drove them here and there, As the winds did those of the upper air. 45 Then the rain came down, and the broken stalks Were bent and tangled across the walks; And the leafless network of parasite bowers Massed into ruin; and all sweet flowers. Between the time of the wind and the snow 50 All loathliest weeds began to grow, Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck, Like the water-snake's belly and the toad's back. And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank, And the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank, 55 Stretched out its long and hollow shank, And stifled the air till the dead wind stank. For Winter came: the wind was his whip: One choppy finger was on his lip: He had torn the cataracts from the hills And they clanked at his girdle like manacles; His breath was a chain which without a sound 90 The earth, and the air, and the water bound; He came, fiercely driven, in his chariot-throne By the tenfold blasts of the Arctic zone. Then the weeds which were forms of living death Fled from the frost to the earth beneath. 95 Their decay and sudden flight from frost Was but like the vanishing of a ghost! And under the roots of the Sensitive Plant The moles and the dormice died for want: The birds dropped stiff from the frozen air 100 And were caught in the branches naked and bare. First there came down a thawing rain And its dull drops froze on the boughs again; Then there steamed up a freezing dew Which to the drops of the thaw-rain grew; 105 And a northern whirlwind, wandering about Like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out, Shook the boughs thus laden, and heavy, and stiff, And snapped them off with his rigid griff. When Winter had gone and Spring came back 110 The Sensitive Plant was a leafless wreck; But the mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels, Rose like the dead from their ruined charnels.

CALDWELL The death of the Lady is followed by the death of the Garden, the representation of symbiotic life, in a passage striking for its parallelism and pathos (17-21). At this point Summer has changed into Autumn, the season of death and decay, and the obituaries begin for the flowers, symbols to the Sensitive Plant of an ideal state, the memories of symbiotic fulfillment. The first to die are those which were emphasized in Part First, the roses and the lilies, and in the list which follows, memories are aroused only to be erased. The gay colors of Part First, the colors of life, become "brown, yellow, and gray, and red, / And white with the whiteness of what is dead" (34-35), the winds no longer carry the music of the Garden but are instead the bearers of the seeds of ugly weeds, the water-lilies in the stream are decapitated (42-43), the paths are blocked with lifeless plants, the bowers are "Massed into ruin" (49), and finally "all sweet flowers" (49) have died. The next seven stanzas, 13-19, tell of the birth and growth of "All loathliest weeds" (51), a lurid description of the flowers' suc cessors and of the transformation of what had been the Sensitive Plant's "ministering angels" into emblems and agents of poison and death. The dew which carried the flowers' fragrance is now the ugly coating of the "monstrous undergrowth" (59), and whereas it once lay like fire in the flowers, then rose into the air, it now is multiplied into "agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould" that start "like mist from the wet ground cold" (62-63); the stream is stopped and silenced by "a leprous scum" (66); the wind has ceased, and in the still air (which once was "all love") the vapors which formerly contained all the flowers' delights now "have strength to kill" (71); the beams of light which bore the flowers' hues and the sublunar meteors which laughed around the Lady's footsteps are transformed into "unctuous meteors" which are, above all, a parody of the insects which served the Sensitive Plant and kissed "the sweet lips of the flowers" (2.51); now these meteors "crept and flitted" and "every branch on which they alit / By a venomous blight was burned and bit" (76-77). The meaning of the weeds is clear enough within the context of the poem, but there are parallels elsewhere in Shelley. In Prometheus Unbound, the Earth tells of "black blight on herb and tree" and of "ineradicable poisonous weeds" (1.173, 175), a monstrous growth which, like that in "The Sensitive Plant," is the direct result of the separation of mother and child, in the former of the Earth and her son Prometheus. But</page><page sequence="29">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 249 when Jupiter has been overthrown, Asia restored to Prometheus, and Prometheus to his mother Earth, the weeds and blight dis appear and the flowers return (ui.iii), just as in the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone: the earth, rendered barren and dead by the separation of mother and child, bursts into verdant life on the occasion of their reunion. The next two stanzas of Part Third (20 and 21) describe the Sensitive Plant at the intersection of Autumn and Winter: its leaves, which once it had closed beneath the kisses of Night, are now folded and congealed within the glue of its tears; and soon it has suffered a kind of castration, stripped of its leaves and hewn of its branches by the heavy axe of the wind, which once had fed it with silver dew. Most importantly, it wept "like one forbid" (78), that is, banished or exiled; once again the image of a lost Eden, of the death which is a result of banishment from the sacred Garden, recurs. The next seven stanzas of Part Third (22-28) begin with the coming of Winter and end with its departure and the return of Spring. It is a time of death and desolation, and a nega tive recapitulation of Summer's life. Winter itself is a personified figure of separation?his finger is "choppy" and he tears the cata racts from the hills?and of binding?the cataracts are his manacles, his breath is a soundless chain which binds the earth, the air, and the water; and he brings an end to the perpetual motion which had characterized the Garden alive.25 The wind is a whip; the beasts and birds, which had earlier been gratified "In an ocean of dreams without a sound" (1.103), now die "for want" in the earth and air frozen by the chain of Winter's breath, again "without a sound" (3.90); the rain, which once brought forth the first flowers, now thaws, then freezes on the boughs; the dew is "freezing" and is added to the frozen rain; the winds, which brought the dew, and all of the Garden's pleasures, to the Sensitive Plant, have become a "northern whirlwind" (106), described in a simile which touches the very center of the poem's symbolism: the whirlwind wanders about "Like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out" (107). With the return of Spring, in the last stanza of Part Third, the Sensitive Plant is a "leafless wreck"; does this mean, as virtually all 25. E.g., the stream's "motion of sweet sound and radiance" (1.48), the motion of the winds, insects, and dew, the "quivering vapours ... in which every sound, and odour, and beam, / Move" (90-93), the Lady's "motion" (2.7), the trembling and panting of tremulous desire.</page><page sequence="30">250 RICHARD S. CALDWELL commentators have assumed, that it has died? But it would have been easy for Shelley to write "lifeless" instead of "leafless" and I am inclined to think that we should regard the Sensitive Plant as still alive, but as totally desolate and deprived of all joy, sur rounded not by the flowers but by the "mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels" which "Rose like the dead from their ruined charnels," emblems of the Sensitive Plant's life which is equivalent to death. Wasserman has an interesting observation here which deserves elaboration. He points out that "Shelley has chosen his flowers with care. All of the other flowers of the garden . . . are perennials in the climates Shelley knew. Only the exotic Sensitive Plant, like man, is an annual."26 But Wasserman believes that the Sensitive Plant, like the other flowers, dies and is not reborn, since it is essential to his theory of the poem, as an allegory of faulty powers of perception, that the death of the Lady and the Garden be a function of the Sensitive Plant's death, that is, of the failure of the senses to com prehend the Platonic "forms constitutive of Existence."27 It is not necessary, however, to invoke abstract metaphysics in order to understand what is happening in the poem.28 We would expect the flowers to return, but they do not, at least not to their previous state, since the death of symbiosis is a once-for-all event. But they are perennials, and in a sense they will live on, as the poem's Con clusion suggests, in the perennial representations in the human heart of a lost bliss that is recaptured only in dreams (and perhaps after death). We would expect the Sensitive Plant not to return, but it does live on; its new state, however, is a living death, the overwhelming isolation of the triumph of individuation, which stands like an angel with a flaming sword before the Eden of symbiosis. 26. Wasserman, p. 169. 27. Wasserman, p. 178. 28. Wasserman may well be correct in his assessment of the metaphysical issues, but I presume that neither he nor I would argue that either his or my interpretation is the only correct and possible one (although I would argue that the philosophical and poetic issues may both stem from the same unconscious sources). Like Wasserman, I believe that the death of the Lady and the Garden is a function of the nature of the Sensitive Plant. I would, however, regard the essential fact of that nature not as cognitive inability but as the mani festation of desire for what cannot be present, as Shelley tells us in line 77, just as the end of the Garden of Eden was a function of the beginning of Adam's desire for what he did not have, the fruit of the forbidden tree.</page><page sequence="31">"THE SENSITIVE PLANT": ORIGINAL FANTASY 251 CONCLUSION Whether the Sensitive Plant, or that Which within its boughs like a Spirit sat, 115 Ere its outward form had known decay, Now felt this change, I cannot say. Whether that Lady's gentle mind, No longer with the form combined Which scattered love, as stars do light, 120 Found sadness, where it left delight, I dare not guess; but in this life Of error, ignorance, and strife, Where nothing is, but all things seem, And we the shadows of the dream, 125 It is a modest creed, and yet Pleasant if one considers it, To own that death itself must be, Like all the rest, a mockery. That garden sweet, that lady fair, 130 And all sweet shapes and odours there, In truth have never passed away: 'Tis we, 'tis ours, are changed; not they. For love, and beauty, and delight, There is no death nor change: their might 135 Exceeds our organs, which endure No light, being themselves obscure. The Conclusion, like Part Second, may be regarded as divided into three equal parts, or as divided into half. In any case, the line which is emphasized, both by the entire content of the poem and by being either the middle line of the middle section or the last line of the first half, is line 125, "And we the shadows of the dream." The "error, ignorance, and strife," the illusion of reality, the uncertainty concerning the significance of the change and decay of outward form, represent the conscious perceptions of an individuated, sub jective life. It is a shadow, but a shadow which may somehow suggest the outline of what is real and beautiful, the dream which reveals desire and its true object. The Garden and the Lady "have never passed away"; they remain in the hidden reality of unconscious desire and its obscure manifestations. It is consciousness, not these eternal fantasies, which is the agent of change. Death itself is "a mockery" (129), since what we know as life, ruled by the consciousness which prohibits per ception of the essence of desire and by the individuated existence which prevents fulfillment of desire, is really death; as Earth says in</page><page sequence="32">252 RICHARD S. CALDWELL Prometheus Unbound, "Death is the veil which those who live call life" (iii. 113). But "For love, and beauty, and delight, / There is no death nor change" (134-35); so also in the unconscious there is no death nor change, but rather the fulfillment of wishes in the memories of past gratification.29 If absolute bliss, the state of total gratification in which nothing is lacking and therefore nothing is desired, exists before the begin ning of individuated life (i.e., in symbiosis) and continues to exist beyond the perceptions of individual consciousness (i.e., in the un conscious), then might it not be re-established by the death of the individual, the dissolution of the barrier which individuated exis tence places in the way of fusion with the lost part of the self? This mystical thesis, understandable in a poet's vision, may also be read in Freud's concept of the death instinct, which is, as he says, the "urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the pressure of external disturbing forces," the desire "to reach an ancient goal by paths alike old and new, ... an old state of things, an initial state from which the living entity has at one time or other departed and to which it is striving to return by the circuitous paths along which its development leads."30 But whereas Freud finally identified this "ancient goal" and "initial state" as the "inorganic" and "inanimate" (because, I think, he did not or would not accept the implications of his own words), Shelley saw more clearly that our life is lived, in Lacan's phrase, "entre-deux morts"31: that death which ends symbiosis (and the Garden) and that which concludes individual existence. And we need not bring up the vexed problem of the manner of Shelley's own death to see that there runs through his poetry the suggestion that the desired state of non-desire may be achieved only in death. We need only recall those incredible and poignant words of Earth in Prometheus Unbound: And death shall be the last embrace of her Who takes the life she gave, even as a mother Folding her child, says, 'Leave me not again.'
