<plain_text><page sequence="1">A * N &amp; Ontology and Autobiographical Performance Joanna Frueh's Aesthetics of Orgasm Jill O'Bryan Place and Time Las Vegas's strip is a horn of plenty spilling over with women and men available for anything, anytime. Vegas's faux milieu is surreal. Visually there is a huge gap between the glittering enter tainers/sexy casino workers and their voyeurs, predominantly middle America's middle-class businessmen and families. Las Vegas promises to materialize fantasies but never consummates its promise. Maybe this is due to the high cost of winning a fortune. Maybe purchased fantasies pan out to be vapid experiences. It all ends when your money runs out, but the strip offers its promises with a razzle-dazzle that inspires a desire for more. Thus the irony of capitalism—it is undeniable that Jill O'Bryan is an artist, writer, and independent scholar. Her writing includes Carnal Art: Orlan's Refacing (2005), an in-depth exploration of Orlan's surgical performances; "Introduction: Fucking Hot," in Clairvoyance (For Those In The Desert) (2008), a collection of Frueh's performance texts; and essays on feminist performance art in n.paradoxa, Art Journal, and Women and Performance.

As Joanna Frueh tells us, "Desire is limitless: deal with it" (2008:298). The strip is of course an illusion—a corporate one, well done. Even so I am struck by the irony of seeing Frueh's performance here, in the land of decadence where eroticism is a naughty adventure. Holding onto this irony I allow myself momentary vertigo when moving between the slinky strip and Frueh's poetic The Aesthetics of Orgasm {AO), which was performed in September 2003 at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), one mile from the strip. In AO Frueh eroticizes her prose, her body, and her history, and expands eroticism into a way of life. So, how do Vegas's showgirls and Frueh's AO compare within the genre of live erotic perfor mance? Both are theatrical, voyeuristic, and about the sexualized female body. One is about see ing the female body, the other about living inside of one. The two perform for different crowds, and for Frueh the erotic is a way of life, an intellectual pursuit, a feminist scholar's nexus of study (and therefore political). AO is also autobiographical, and extends its conceptual images way beyond erotic surfaces and the present moment. Vegas's showgirls are anonymous, fleeting, manufactured. They are without a voice. The Setup Stage left—a chair, and on the floor next to it a bouquet of long-stem pink roses; stage right—a microphone, a black music stand, and immediately to its (stage) right, a remarkably tall, round chocolate cake with large pink roses cascading down the front in an arc.1 Its pecu liar shape, taller than wide, identifies the cake as a yummy chocolate phallus, and the roses, as beautiful as they are, resemble large pom-pom buttons—they are round and fluffy, in a verti cal arched alignment. I should add that the engineering of the cake is completely hidden behind thick dark chocolate icing so that you are unaware of the layers. To punctuate its theatrical, yet anthropomorphic objectness the cake sits on top of a tall white sculpture stand, and although it evokes a desire to indulge, it is untouchable. Frueh is wearing a pink Betsey Johnson dress with a ruffled hem that is three-quarter length in the front and graduates to full length in the back. It is a dress that gives off many messages. The pink voile has the daintiness of a bridesmaid's gown. It hangs from string shoulder straps and clings to her body. It is moderately low cut in the front and very low cut in the back. When Frueh enters (stage left) she is also wearing a lightly sequined matching capelet. With this on, it is the pink dress-up frock of a little girl. The monologue matches her costume here. She begins by telling us her primal scene: walking in on her parents having sex. Then she removes the capelet, walks stage left, sits in the chair and directly addresses her lover, fantasizing an impas sioned sexual encounter with him. Here the frock transforms into a sexy woman's date-night dress. Throughout AO, Frueh moves between these two voices—one directed to the audience, while standing stage right, the other to a lover that is not present, while sitting stage left. She moves between these two positions in '50s vintage-looking brown mules, that don't match the light, airy quality of the dress. They emphasize the dress-up dress motif (my fan tasy: the dress is hurriedly tried on...a pre- or post-sex outfit for a future occasion, one with lighter—maybe pink—shoes?). On the other hand the shoes, like weights, serve to ground the slinky but fluffy dress. They make a clomping noise. Frueh grows up from them and stands her ground just fine. 1. In this particular performance the roses were made of frosting, while in other performances of The Aesthetics of Orgasm the roses on the cake were actual flowers, which Frueh prefers. Figure 1.

(I think of Snow White and her step mother—aging beauty and ageless beauty—do fairies age? [Frueh 2001:217-24].) The dress is skin-like, and the ruffles resemble labia folds. The truth is that I first thought of a brides maid when I saw her perform live, and it wasn't until I watched the performance on video that I made the pink ruffle/labia association. On video she appears smaller and the dress and body appear as one. Here I stand. Here I am with another person. Here I am with another penis, another navel, another set of the same circumstances in a different body led by a different ego, defense mechanisms, and compensatory behaviors. Here I am in an inescapable way. Here I am, in all my blushes and whatever little pim ples exist today on my high round ass. Orgasm puts you in your place. Here I am. Here I am. Or, with one or more partners, here we are, here we are. (Frueh 2008:229) Frueh opens with her primal scene. Sometime between the ages of six and eight she walks in on her parents having sex. Rather than being traumatized as would a Freudian child, she is ini tiated into a love of the erotic: "My primal scene is a kind of Proustian madeleine, recalling me throughout my life to the roots of my persistent love of sex" (2008:228). I immediately envy this experience I never had—a childhood initiation into the erotic—and know that from this point forth her personal sexual language differs from mine. This realization is a bit of a relief. I can listen to her without trying to see myself in her story. Weaving a critical perspective into sex, orgasm, the erotic, Frueh immediately positions herself within feminist scholarship. Up front she informs us that the content of her dis course—eroticism as a way of life—is not often discussed in the feminist intellectual realm: "Lovemaking is an untoward theme for a feminist intellectual. I can't help it: sexual bodies, sex ualized bodies, bodies in sexual contact intoxicate me, as orgasm, a key point of sexual contact, intoxicates me" (228). So why untoward? Because orgasm is too personal and not political enough? Or because it is too political to touch? Perhaps female orgasm as "a key point of [hetero] sexual contact" is too feminine, too biological, essentialist, and therefore not relevant? AO contains intimate biographical discoveries of the erotic as a way of life that Frueh has always pursued. She is a scholar who not only performs erotic prose and poetry, but also cre ates and enthusiastically celebrates eroticism in all aspects of her life. The result is that she cen ters her sexual presence not just within her performances, but within her scholarship as well. In Erotic Faculties (1996) she explains: Maybe we are searching for erotic ways of living, which express the joy, depth, richness and responsibility of being human. The erotic is the source and sustenance of wisdom, but Western culture does not understand the erotic—that it can exist in spiritual and political activity and activism, that it can be dead or alive during sex, that it is present in prosaic as well as ecstatic moments. The erotic is expansive, but it has become shrunken due to misunderstanding of it and accommodations to dullness. (114) Erotic terrain is not taboo for artists, but it is risky. There are many who have used vaginal imagery in some form: Judy Chicago, Hannah Wilke, Annie Sprinkle. And using the orgasm as a motif, Annie Sprinkle and Maria Beatty created the video The Sluts And Goddesses Video Workshop Or How To Be A Sex Goddess In 101 Easy Steps (1992), which features erotic ways to self-stimu late, including how to achieve female ejaculation (Sprinkle). Frueh divulges her secrets too: I sit in a movie theater, legs crossed, rotating my hips so slightly that no one would know I'm doing it. I have to keep myself from moaning. I'm rotating my hips because I'm miss ing my lover. I'm missing the substance of love. My hips first moved like that when I PQ 128</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2.

(Photo by Dean Burton) was a little girl, desiring Ricky Nelson or masturbating in bed in the afternoon or before going to sleep at night. I want my lover's hands in my hair and his words in my ears. I want to be making out with him in the back row of a movie theater, because he's as good as chocolate. (2008:305-6) One particularly important artistic precedent to Frueh's AO is Carolee Schneemann's film Fuses (1965), a montage of the artist and her lover, James Tenney, making love—their genitals are explicitly depicted and also dissolve in and out of each other, and their fucking bodies fuse with images of nature. Kitch, Schneemann's cat, is filmed sitting on the windowsill observing the lovemaking. Kitch's presence as anima is apolitical, personal; he acts as interlocutor between the erotic worlds inside the window and outside beyond it (Stiles 2002:10). In Fuses the partners are equals in action and pleasure, the lovemaking is hot, the genitalia explicit, and the film is poetic, romantic, and political—it is a filmic antidote to pornography. A painter at heart, Schneemann challenges the viewer to see beyond the sign of the body, and into nature. Her erotic montage divulges passions, pleasures, freedom, and intimacy. Schneemann's heterosexually charged material, presented as something other than porn—in this case a painterly personal documentation of (hetero)sexual pleasure—places her in a posi tion of audacious erotic power. Her images depict an equality between her and her lover, and the permission she gives viewers to become voyeurs frees, and thus empowers her as an art ist. Her layering of imagery gives the film abstracted meaning, something not usually paired with filmic explicit sex (already stereotyped through porn as a skin-deep one-night stand). Thus explicit sex simultaneously layered with multivalent images and meanings places the H cr a. 129</page><page sequence="5">film outside the language of porn, and beyond the language of imagistic film. Unprecedented, the film demands that its viewers decipher how to see (it). Incapable of grasping every image equally, they first grasp what is most striking—the genital heterosexuality and the autobio graphical reference to the artist. In 1977 Stan Brakhage asked Schneemann to introduce a program of erotic films by women (including her Fuses and Plumb Line) at the Telluride Film Festival. Schneemann found herself having to speak out against the program's given title, "The Erotic Woman." Immediately pre ceding her second performance of Interior Scroll she addressed this problem of preconceived notions regarding eroticism and women: Having been described and proscribed by the male imagination for so long, no woman artist now wants to assume that she will define an "erotic woman" for other women—the very notion immediately reverts to the traditional stereotypes that this program of films vividly counters. Perhaps these films will redefine "The Erotic Woman," or to the con trary the films will be found to be anti-erotic, sub-erotic, non-erotic. Perhaps this "erotic woman" will be seen as primitive, devouring, insatiable, clinical, obscene, or forthright, courageous, integral. (Schneemann 2002:155) Early in the feminist movement it was recognized that the personal is the political. The core premise, derived from experience, was that, first and foremost, the heterosexual system was a power structure—the female oppressed, the male, the oppressor. And the spin-off from this core colored all heterosexual behavior, including sex. Amber Hollibaugh and Cherri'e Moraga write in What We're Rollin Around in Bed With: Sexual Silences in Feminism-. In early [feminist] discussions, lesbianism was ignored and heterosexuality was not under stood as both an actual sexual interaction and a system. [...] By analyzing the institution of heterosexuality, feminists learned what's oppressive about it and why people cooperate with it or don't but we didn't learn what is sexual. [...] There is something genuine that happens between heterosexuals, but gets perverted in a thousand different ways. There is heterosexuality outside of heterosexism. What grew out of this kind of "nonsexual" theory was a "transcendent" definition of sexuality where lesbianism (since it exists outside the institution of heterosexuality) came to be seen as the practice of feminism. It set up a "perfect" vision of egalitarian sexuality, where we could magically leap over our heterosexist conditioning into mutually orgasmic, struggle-free, trouble-free sex. ([1983] 2000:588-89) What follows between Hollibaugh and Moraga is a frank discussion of lesbian identity con structs, lovemaking, sex, and orgasm. One butch, the other femme, they talk about their strug gles to do away with polarizing heterosexual determinants: that one should play out the male role (subject) and the other the female role (object). Their discussion reveals interrogative struggles that individuals can experience apropos (often overgeneralizing) political ideolo gies. It also touches on a performative phenomenon that Judith Butler terms the "appearance of substance": Significantly, if gender is instituted through acts which are internally discontinuous, then the appearance of substance is precisely that, a constructed identity, a performative accom plishment which the mundane social audience, including the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief. ([1996] 2002:121) Frueh's words regarding heterosexuality—"I love sex with men. They become feminine. I become masculine, we are both and neither gender" (2008:294)—sting with a necessity to cre ate erotic language/imagery informed by her own individually constructed identities and in appreciation of her sexuality. As constructed, her AO identities—masculine, feminine, fairy, eight-year-old girl, dominatrix—activate temporal figments that resonate beyond her words. s b CQ o 130</page><page sequence="6">These characters are symbiotic with her (storyteller) presence, and since both Frueh and her AO identities occupy the same performative time and place they simultaneously feed each other's performative presences. In AO Frueh's intoxica tion with eroticism as a way of life expands in waves: During orgasm one feels the whole mind, body, and psyche together and beyond the individual into the psyche and body of the lover. These feelings linger beyond the moments of orgasm and become in and of themselves the nexus of erotic love stories and, beyond, a way of life. From the moment of orgasm there exists a decenter ing of self, of ego (300), and at certain points a pleasurable loss of identity (a melding with her lover, and a result of profound vulnerability) that is freeing and allows her to experience herself and her lover in a fully roman tic, erotic light—the lightness of a fairy pleasurably living in the world. I interperet Frueh's fairy to be the heterosexual man who becomes feminine while hav ing sex with a woman, and her merging with man during orgasm. But more importantly the fairy is a personification of her experiences of eroticism. In other words, for her the fairy is a persona through which orgasm expands and is transported into all other life experiences—eroticism as a way of life2: Orgasm does end, but, like emotions it remains, by embedding itself in the psyche, and although orgasm gradually fades from immediate regard, if we wish, we can consciously carry it with us, we can feel it as a constant pleasure, as a continuity of pleasure in our lives. The continuity of pleasure both comes from and creates sparkling creatures, fairies who spark pleasure in other people. (293) There is a presence of the lover throughout AO. Frueh speaks to him via email. She presents to us her most private sexual voice. Now public, this voice mirrors her fantasy: I want you to push me up against a building's wall, in some big city on a side street at night, push me up against it hard, your cock, hard, singling out my cunt for love. A wall where people can hear our pleasure but almost none can see it, unless they want to: from around a corner our groans and hyperventilation, our taking away of each other's breath and our giving our breath to one another—breathing into each other's mouths with kisses—seduces some voyeur, one who's supersensitive to sounds, or to sex in the nearby air, as if antennaed for it like an insect. (289) Figure 4. Joanna Frueh posing for the performative photo portrait faerie mermaid (2004). (Photo by Frances Murray and Joanna Frueh) Figure 4. Joanna Frueb posing for the performative photo portrait faerie mermaid (2004). (Photo by Frances Murray and Joanna Frueh) 2.1 think that Frueh intends her fairy to be understood as somewhat innocent, and perhaps even naive due to its ability to be carefree and indulgent in sex. Certainly she is only interested in the term as a celebration of jouis sance and not a derogative term to describe effeminate behaviors in gay men. H — a. 131</page><page sequence="7">After sharing her fantasy Frueh eats cake. She gorges herself on it for a moment enjoying her indulgence but completely aware of her audience. She speaks to us candidly about how good it tastes—creamy, with lots of butter. Frueh's text is autobiographical. As such, it informs her presence by making her speech and body one—"speaking as a female body" (290), the body exteriorizes its private interior by also revealing the guts of language: cunt, pussy, cock. Frueh presents herself as a violently commu nicative experience, and plays out a triangular exchange. She speaks from her wide-open sexual psyche. Her lover performs. We watch them both. Frueh imbues her presence with the presence of others she has conjured, intimately com municating with them. Her audience members are voyeurs peeping through the keyhole. Her invoked personages (of her and her lover having sex), while exuding sexual presence, are also peculiarly abstract. This is partially due to the structure of storytelling, which is guided by a simultaneity occurring between the storyteller and the story. This simultaneity does have a hier archy (of sorts) based on materiality. The storyteller is material; the story imagined. But the storyteller has several voices—her own and those of her characters. So materialism, or lack thereof, has nothing to do with presence. Human presence and theatrical presence are shared by both the teller and her characters. They dynamically intersect, creating and re-creating one another. Frueh speaks as a female body of her imagined selves at different ages, in a variety of settings, erotically engaging with men. Her monologue moves quickly. We both observe and walk with Frueh into her parents' bedroom, surprising them during sex; then we watch her hav ing sex with her lover. We watch as Frueh compares herself to Sade's Madame Duclos, and then we experience the complexity of her emotions when at eight she finds herself being admired by a guest of her parents. We are with her there when she discovers her power to seduce men. We are voyeurs as she engages many times with her lover. All of these characters inform Frueh's stage presence. The simultaneous presences of teller and characters are in constant flux—they move through time, distort, disappear, embrace, and ignore one another. They dance, fight, and have sex together. Frueh proclaims, "Yes. We know each other's center in the paradoxical disso lution or exchange of self into the lover, into the decentering, into the loss of identity that is the clearest clarity" (300). The story characters, as though knowing that they are sharing time with their inventor, vie to upstage her even while she is creating them. In AO Frueh crowds the stage with the charac ters she cultivates, and together she and they inform her autobiographical self beyond belief. She is voluminous, but also peculiarly distorted, as though we can only see her with double vision. Frueh takes advantage of the simultaneity inherent in storytelling and pushes the onto logical envelope that states that one can only share what one has, one cannot share what one is. The complexity of this premise has to do with the relationship between the presence of the self and other, and the incapacity to share one's unique experience of existence. One of my attrac tions to performance, and storytelling, has always been the desire (inherent in the structure of these art forms) to attempt this sharing. For me, this question of simultaneity and its relationship to ontology lingers in all of my thinking about Frueh's performances, and specifically in AO, where eroticism is a state of rela tion and not limited to an erotic act. As such it becomes an intimate place of thought and per sonages that call for one another (whether real or imagined) to have and share erotic presence. So how do the ontological questions—what is being, and is being a universal same—play out in performance? The profundity of being is that it exists apriori to all else—including perfor mance of self, identity, body, and gender (e.g., Heidegger's Dasein\ see for example Being and Time [1962] 1996). Beyond this, language and presence are proofs of being. Emmanuel Levinas writes that the human body is informed and enhanced by language, and the presence of the other is always already incomprehensible. But this incomprehensibility empowers discourse with meaning. He sets up an inherent equation between being and language and between lan b PQ 132</page><page sequence="8">guage and presence. Levinas's ontological ethics presuppose that being is experienced in rela tion to the other. He terms this the "face-to-face relation." In this relation there is an unequal and infinite responsibility toward the other (1985:57). Ethics exists prior to being. It conditions being. The priority of being-for-the-other comes before being (Levinas 1969:195). Levinas also states: "the difference of sex is not the duality of two complementary terms. For two complementary terms presuppose a pre-existing whole" (1985:67). He goes on to state that love is not a fusion, but rather "the pathos of love consists, to the contrary, in an insurmount able duality of beings; it is a relationship with what forever slips away. [...] The other as other here is not an object which becomes ours or which becomes us, to the contrary, it withdraws into its mystery" (67). This withdrawal of the other is also directly related to language, which fails us because we can never speak what we are. What we speak is the shadow of silence, the unspoken. As Levinas implies, the silence of what is not spoken is where one's individual qualities of being reside. For me this phenomenon is brought to the fore by poetry and prose in which language is so per fectly designed to guide you through layers of the unspoken: One can exchange everything between beings, except existing. In this sense, to be is to be isolated by existing. I am monad inasmuch as I am. It is by existing that I am without doors or windows, and not through any content in me which would be incommunicable. If it is incommunicable it is that it is rooted in my being, which is what is most private in me. In this way, every enlargement of my consciousness, of my means of expression remains without effect on my relation with existing, the interior relation par excellence. (1985:59) This Levinas quotation earmarks one of the themes of modem art (in particular surrealism and automatic writing, and abstract expressionism) as performances of the interior self, as attempts to externalize the interior, to perform the exchange of existence. So, having argued that imagined characters (figments, and perhaps fairies) have presence, do they also have existence? That is to say—do they exist? I am reminded of Warren Gorman's description of the imaginary anatomy as a homunculus—a presence inherent in being. His male homunculus is quite a comical fellow, and creates himself by determining the sizes of his body parts in direct proportion to his ability to see and/or sense them in the material body. The homunculi [...] stimulate the eye, for their visual appearance is that of distorted little male persons, whose deformities are arresting to the studious as well as the curious. The face and the mouth of the homunculus are huge, his forehead is barely present, his hands gargantuan and his genitals gross. He has a respectably large intra-abdominal area, but he possesses not even a trace of the brain area. [...] Those parts of the body which can nei ther be seen nor felt do not appear in the motor homunculus and those parts which do not yield sensations of perceived touch are denied a position in the sensory homunculus. Since the brain is hidden from vision, and imperceptive of touch to its matter, we must reluctantly grant that our cherished but imaginary mannequins are not able to represent our brains. (Gorman 1969:193) Assuming the imaginary body creates itself in this way—Frueh gives it totally new dimen sions. Her imaginary sexualized bodies (hers and her lover's) are quite well proportioned, with the intelligent mind fully developed and linguistically charged, and the full body an erotic tool. She colors them pink, gives them wings, and various facial expressions: audacious, seductive, defiant, relaxed...performing. This is because within the overall schema of AO, the original ideas put forth are equally as erotic as the sex scenes that weave through them: eroticism as a way of life; fairies (who allow themselves to float, play, and are not afraid to lose their identity into that of a lover through powerfully intoxicating sex, and then regain it only after having fully experienced H tr 133</page><page sequence="9"># * V V # v Figure 5. Joanna Frueh posing in gothic/fairy, from the performative photographic self-portrait series Joanna in the Desert (2006). (Photo by Jill O'Bryan and Joanna Frueh) it); pink (feminine, masculine, both together, the color fairies wear). Frueh is intoxicated with her words while performing. Eroticism permeates her theo ries. "Speaking as a female body" her words linger in the mind, inspired by her mind being inside her body. But does Frueh make herself an object of desire? How does she reconcile this with her stu dents? With her audience? Is AO pornography or not? She energetically expresses her love for both the ageless lover she addresses, and for her audience members, with whom she is as open as with her lover. She is a romantic making love to the audience by filling their heads with sexualized language, beau tifully articulated. There is all of this in AO: the complexity of ontological experience; the other; the Other; the warmth of another's body. And, there is a politics to this warmth that inflames human history. Politics inflames. So does sex. A story of one inflamed Freudian child: The evening I saw AO one young woman became upset by Joanna's per formance. She was offended by the sexual content—but the way she voiced her discontent was peculiar. She began wrinkling paper during the performance creating a loud aural disturbance. One glance in her direction led me to believe that she was trying to get a piece of paper from her notebook to take notes, but apparently during the intermission she voiced her objections to one of the professors present. We are voyeurs. We watch her and her lover's intimate relations. Does this make Frueh a pornographer? She is a pornographer by her own admittance: "I'm a pornographer like the Marquis de Sade. We play with sensually primal language. Perhaps we bring people to the verge of the verge of orgasm" (2008:296). And then: Deep dark chocolate, deep dark secret: I've been looking for a fairy lover in the everyday barrage of shitfire. Deep dark chocolate, deep dark forest: I have heard that I look like a dominatrix, but only one dominatrix do I identify with, Mme. Duclos, inside the Chateau Silling of Sade's 120 Days of Sodom. We both tell stories about our lives, our sex, our good looks, our manly aggressions on men's bodies. My midlife authority is precisely a vehicle for identifying with the midlife Duclos, with being, like her, a man in the guise of femi ninity. (2008:297) Figure 5. Joanna Frueh posing in gothic/fairy, from the performative photographic self-portrait series Joanna in the Desert (2006). (Photo by Jill O'Bryan and Joanna Frueh) b PQ</page><page sequence="10">But we know Duclos as well. She tells her stories in the first of 120 Days of Sodom, before the murderous end will have been reached. One of those she tells is of the beautiful 13-year-old innkeeper's daughter, seduced by an ecclesiastic whose talents of sexual persuasion are remark able. Duclos begins her story: He [the ecclesiastic] arrived, he was shut in with the innkeeper's young daughter, I observed him. The tete-d-tete was lengthy, the seducer put into it an astonishing degree of pathos, the child cried, became animated, appeared to enter into a kind of enthusiasm. This was the moment when the man's eye shone most brightly and when we noticed his gestures over the front of his breeches. Shortly afterwards he stood up, the child held out her arms as though to embrace him, he kissed her like a father and showed no kind of lewd attitude. He left, and three hours later the girl arrived at Madame Guerin's with her things. (Sade 2000:39) Like Joanna, the innkeeper's daughter was confronted with a grown man's sexualizing atten tions. Joanna's was a young pianist. She was eight. He was a guest of her parents who, while sit ting across from Joanna at dinner, let her know that she was seducing him. This incident allows us to peek into the psyche of the child who was once a voyeur, and now is gazed upon. Duclos, the voyeur in her story; we, the voyeurs of her and also vicariously through her; we, watching Joanna stand, make a stand, sit, fuck, get fucked. The performer's presence is visual, linguistic, but also aural. So here lies the main separation between the female object of desire (to return to plight of the Las Vegas showgirl) and Freuh's performance of feminine eroticism: speech. It is a powerful mark of individuality, and in AO Frueh fuses aural resonance with her pleasure in telling erotic tales. She speaks about her lovers with a sensuous lilt, and she sings to us as well—hot poetry through the throat. The voice precedes linguistics, and is an externalization of the body's interior. Vocalization is a visceral activity that transcends embodiment while remaining unique to the body. In Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression Adriana Cavarero writes that the voice can be said to be the onto logical center of being, and that it has seductive libidinal qualities: "Unlike thought, which tends to reside in the immaterial otherworld of ideas, speech is always a question of bodies, filled with drives, desires, and blood. The voice vibrates, the tongue moves. Wet membranes and taste buds are mixed up with the flavor of the tones" (2005:134). Speech is an experience of embodiment that lies at the intersection between one's body and the telling of one's personal story. In AO Frueh reveals her quest for understanding and experiencing soul-and-mind inseparable-from-body3 to be rooted in experiences of pleasure and thus a path for learning how to love oneself. Frueh's stage presence grows out of a self-love that gives her substantial personal power and access to dynamic experiences of growth, beauty, and sensuality. Her intent here is to teach by example that eroticism is a way of life, accessible to all who wish to partake. Frueh has been criticized for being narcissistic, but she maintains that this is a shortsighted judgment that has nothing to do with the existence of self-love, which can be a personal (as well as a political) strategy to individuate, de-objectify, heal, and empower women (and men).
