<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS SCIENCE AND SUBJECTIVITY The question whether or not science must ultimately recognize subjectivity as a determining factor in its methodic ideal has recently been revived owing to certain developments within science itself. To a considerable number of thinkers there seems no way of interpreting the theory of relativity with its orientation from the standpoint of the observer confined within a seemingly parochial system of refer ence, save by frankly acknowledging the subjectivity of science and its ultimate centering in the point of view of the individual. This state of opinion finds a vigorous exponent in the English philosopher, H. Wildon Carr, especially in his recent book A Theory of Monads : Outlines of the Philosophy of the Principle of Relativity, where this thesis, together with the metaphysical and psychological conclusions deduced from it, is one of the outstanding contentions. Science, according to Professor Carr, is today undergoing a revo lution of well-nigh unexampled proportions involving a complete revision of its fundamental principle. It no longer seeks any inde pendent objective absolute as a basis or believes that it studies a world of pure external existence apart from mind, but discovers instead that "ultimately every observer is the unique center of his own system of reference" and that "there is no objective scale by reference to which magnitudes can be assigned an absolute value."1 In consequence of this conversion to subjectivism, science is coming to discard the hypothesis of the atomic structure of the universe in favor of a monadic one, and to substitute for a mechanistic account of natural processes the freedom of individual activity. For the benefit of those to whom this news of the volte face of the sciences may come with something like a shock, it may be well to sketch Professor Carr's reading of the evidence which he takes as pointing in this direction. Like all revolutions, this too has been long ^arr, H. Wildon, A Theory of Monads: Outlines of the Philosophy of the Principle of Relativity, p. 79.</page><page sequence="2">THE MONIST preparing, its causes deep laid in the nature of science. "Its fall of the Bastille,,, says Dr. Carr, "was the verification of Einstein's cal culation of the shift of the stars, observed during the total eclipse of May 29, 1919."2 And as chief causes of the cataclysm, he enumerates three: (1) the doctrine of Berkeley, (2) the scientific conception of life, and (3) the modern criticism of mathematics which has led up to and found its culmination in the theory of relativity. As for Berkeley, there are few who would care to deny that his philosophy has served to call the attention of thinkers, scientific and otherwise, to the part played by the percipient in the structure of knowledge and to the problems involved in determining the status of sensations and conscious states in that structure. Attempts to pass these latter off as non-existent or as mere shadowy redundancies (epiphenomena) of physical events have proved in the long run hard ly more satisfactory to physicists than to philosophers. And it must be admitted that Berkeley's position has lately been reinforced from within physics itself through Einstein's clear demonstration that "the activity of the observer is an essential determinant factor of the nature of the physical fact itself."3 All this, however, seems per fectly possible of acceptance without our being obliged to draw the conclusion drawn by Carr that Berkeley and Einstein are therefore influences constraining science toward subjectivism. While Berkeley may be truly credited with having demonstrated the relativity and subjective dependence of the primary and secondary qualities, his demonstration has plainly to do with them as metaphysical entities and not as scientific facts. The questions at which he labored and the methods by which he answered them were first and last philosophical, and his influence on science was at best only indirect through calling attention to the problems involved in certain phenomena. What Berkeley, and more especially Einstein, have brought home to the scientific world, it would appear, is not subjectivity, but the con viction that, if science is to hope for accuracy, all the conditions of a given event must be taken into account, and that what the object is experienced as must be accounted one of the objective conditions. To Einstein in particular belongs the credit of having shown that what the world is perceived as from any and all possible physical points of view constitutes the essential part, if not all, of its object ive nature for natural science. Another factor which, according to Carr, has been instrumental 2Ibi4., p. 3. *Ibid., p. 5.</page><page sequence="3">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS 3" in making clear to science the subjectivity of its method is the scientific conception of life. This conception, as it stands today, is derived through the application to biology of the mechanistic prin ciples of physics, and represents life as the resultant of an evolution ary process governed by natural selection and the laws of chance. Even the intellect has no free life of its own, but is held to be part and parcel of the evolutionary struggle. Yet this inclusion of the intellect in the process eventually entangles the mechanically-minded scientist in a fatal contradiction. For how can the intellect be the product of a theory which it has itself produced? "How can the intellect, a mode of apprehending reality, be itself an evolution of something which only exists as an abstraction of that mode of appre hending which is the intellect?"4 The only answer to such a paradox, according to the author, is the admission that evolution thus mechani cally conceived is a misleading fiction bred of the contrarieties of the intellect itself.5 Whatever truth there is in the doctrine points rather to the reality of a free, psychical activity ?lan vital as the underly ing source of all life and development. And here the name and teach ings of M. Bergson in favor of a spontaneous, contingent evolutionary process are added to those of Berkeley and Einstein as a further in fluence pointing toward subjectivism. But the charge that a contradiction is involved in the notion that the intellect can be both the source and product of evolution seems largely specious. At any rate, the contradiction, if there be one, appears not only in the mechanistic conception of life but in all theories which assume the genuineness of objective knowledge. For any view which would escape the circle of inner consciousness must assume the self-transcendent and self-representative power of thought to pass beyond the data of immediate experience and to adopt the r?le of spectator of its own development in the natural or der. In all its relations intellect is obliged to assume its capacity as a theoretic means to reveal an end or object, of which it is itself a part, without necessarily distorting or falsifying the object. Indeed, there could hardly be a notion more baleful in its effects upon knowl edge than that theory, broadly speaking, falsifies or itself creates 'facts' which it purports to disclose. Such a notion if once estab lished would suffice to end the research. *Ibid., p. 6. 5Ibid., p. 5. "If intellect is a product of evolution, the whole mechanistic concept of the nature and origin of life is absurd, and the principle which science has adopted must clearly be revised."</page><page sequence="4">312 THE MONIST A third line of criticism which, in Professor Carr's opinion, has played the really decisive part in discrediting objective and absolute conceptions in science, is that addressed to the foundations of mathe matics. Modern investigations of the mathematical continuum show it to be a concept constructed from the implications of sensible per ceptions; while recent criticism of the postulates of geometry has reduced Euclidean geometry from its apparently severeign status as the only possible science of space to that of a mere limiting case among an endless number of systems of equal rank, and in some cases based on directly opposite postulates. Such researches, ac cording to Professor Carr, disclose how even mathematics (generally accepted as the typical exact science) is determined by the point of view of the subject. But it is only in the general principle of rela tivity that this view attains full cumulative expression to the extent that it effects 'a complete revolution of our notions of the structure of the universe.' "The essence of the general principle of relativity,,, he avers, "is to introduce the bane of the physicist, subjectivism, into the arcana of physical science."6 And elsewhere he describes the foundation of Einstein's and Minkowski's theory as "the conception of scientific reality as consisting wholly in individual experience," so that in consequence "the objectivity of science derives its whole meaning from the activity of the subject."7 The repeated failure of experiments like those of Michelson and Morley to determine the movement of a system by observations within the system is inter preted to mean that scientific results are in all cases finally regulated and controlled by the observer or the subject of the experiment. But it is impossible to let these statements pass without question. After all, is it true that the theory of relativity is influencing recent science to abandon its belief in an objective standard and to accept subjectivity as its basic principle? An attempt to answer this ques tion requires some analysis of what Mr. Carr means by subjectivity and an eflfort to understand in what sense he finds these tendencies operative in relativistic physics. (1) First of all, there seems little doubt that he holds as subjective every emphasis by recent science on the uniqueness of the observer's standpoint, and the recognition that each percipient measures the world in terms of his particular system of coordinates. (2) Indeed, Dr. Carr goes further in urging that only from a unique individual standpoint can any system be viewed in its integrity, and hence that science must accept as ultimate 6Carr, H. Wildon, The General Principle of Relativity, p. 21. 7A Theory of Monads, pp. 10-11.</page><page sequence="5">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS the determinations of the individual subject which each system ap plies to itself. (3) Again he indicates his belief that in the theory of relativity an element of free choice, subjectivity in the sense of psychical spontaneity, becomes explicit. (4) Lastly, he implies that to his mind relativity marks the recognition by physical science of a transcendent factor, of subjectivity as denoting the presence of pure egos or monads as the directive force of the phenomenal process, even while they themselves remain outside the range of observable phenomena. However unversed in the mathematical intricacies of relativity the student of philosophy may be (as is the case with the present writer), he may yet have gained certain general impressions of the theory which, in connection with his impressions of science, may seem to justify divergence from Dr. Carr's interpretation and the philosophical conclusions which he derives from it. The root of the trouble rests in Dr. Carr's contention that the theory of relativity represents the universe as constituted of monads. When you look behind the brilliant mathematical devices of Minkowski and Ein stein, he declares, what you find is a conception of reality in essen tials precisely like that of Leibniz : a view of reality as constituted of unique subjects of experience, each mirroring the universe in its ac tive center, in which mirroring, moreover, the world of nature entire ly consists.8 It is in the course of developing this parallel between Leibniz and Einstein that he is led to make what appear to be un founded claims as to the subjectivism of the Einstein theory. In calling attention to the uniqueness of the observer's standpoint, Mr. Carr has apparent justice on his side. The theory does indeed suggest that each observer makes his observations from his special space and time coordinates ; and calls attention to the impossibility of knowing anything about the laws of nature independently of observ er's and their systems of reference. On the other hand, its emphasis upon the observer's coordinates is not, it would seem, for the purpose of stressing the inner, elusive, unshareable character of the psychical, but rather to maintain the high tradition of scientific objectivity which requires that all the conditions of a given event be taken into account. Of these objective conditions, the measurement of the individual ob server from) the standpoint of his particular reference body must be accounted part : and should this fact be denied or overlooked, the re sults must inevitably involve just so much needless discrepancy and error. In calling attention to the effects of such oversight, the voice *Ibid.. p. 10.</page><page sequence="6">3H THE MONIST of Einstein is the voice of scientific objectivity. Here Whitehead has recently given the scientist's answer to the subjectivist interpretation: "The relativity of space and time," he says, "have been construed as.. dependent on the choice of the observer. But it is the observer's body that we want, and not his mind. . . The question is, why did ( Michel son's) interferometer have black bands on its screen, and why did not these bands slightly shift as the instrument turned."9 Moreover, although taking account of the observer, the theory of relativity seems far from conceiving the individual subject as the de termining principle of reality, or from conceding that the ultimate truths of nature are to be found in any particular system of refer ence viewed from its individual standpoint. On the contrary, since the space and the time values of any given system are only relative, the possibility is precluded of finding universally valid measurements within such a system. True and universal conclusions regarding natural processes can only be reached, as I understand it, where we can combine according to certain definite rules measurements made from other reference bodies. In spite of the relativity of the space time measurements of each particular system, it is nevertheless pos sible to arrive at an objectively valid description of physical pro cesses owing to the fact that all these particular measurements cor respond according to definite rules, and can be correlated according to certain principles of transformation.10 Thus, although the standpoint of the individual system is taken into account, it is, as it were, can celled out through its combination with the measurements of other reference systems; so that the laws of nature are freed from de pendence upon accidental features of individuality and hold not merely for one system but for all systems. No less does relativity seem to discount the pretensions of sub jectivity in the sense of free choice. For while it is true that we always start from some particular frame of reference which we ap pear to select more or less arbitrarily, nevertheless the laws of nature determining our results are themselves independent of the choice of our system and, as has been said, hold alike for all systems. Ac cordingly, choice (even though present) is of no ultimate effect in 9Whitehead, A. ., Science and the Modern World, pp. 167-8. 10Cassirer, E., Substance and Function and Einstein's Theory of Relativity, (tr. by W. C. and M .C. Swabey), p. 381 f. "The theory of relativity . . teaches first in the equations of the Lorentz transformation and then in the more far reaching substitution formulae of the general theory, how we may go from these particularities to a definite whole, to a totality of invariant determinations." Cf. Meyerson, E., La deduction relativiste, p. 212.</page><page sequence="7">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS SIS the general theory in so far as it recognizes no 'privileged' reference bodies, but declares that "all bodies of reference , K', etc. are equi valent for the description of natural phenomena."11 For the very reason that the theory aims at universality, subjective choice can ex ert no decisive influence upon it so long as it holds true to its prin ciple of the equivalent of all reference systems of the laws of nature. Lastly, nothing surely could be less acceptable to physicists than the notion that the theory of relativity introduces 'minds' or 'monads' into physical science. In professing to discover that free active selves, subjects that cannot be objects, are implied here, Mr. Carr seems to be trying to remove the basis of modern physics to a transcendent world. Indeed, were the universe really composed of minds or monads, any ultimate reason for the existence of physical science would be withdrawn. For monads are Svindowless' ; to them 'there is no without' ; hence science in such a universe would have no world on which to act. Nor is this all. The introduction of monadic con ceptions into physics would violate one of the most fundamental pos tulates of natural knowledge, which Leibniz himself designated as the 'principle of observability.' This is the postulate which forbids physical science to introduce any supra-phenomenal or non-observ able elements into its system, recognizing that such a violation of principle would be equivalent to its death warrant. Positively phrased, the principle declares that nothing fundamentally outside the sphere of observation can have being in the physical sense. Yet it is only too evident that the admission of pure subjects or monads as directive forces by physical science would constitute just that surrender to obscurantism against which Leibniz was moved to protest. But there seems scarcely need for concern on this score ; instead of monads, present science would seem to prefer hypothesis indicat ing an atomic structure of the universe. Not that modern science would accept atomism in any crude sense of reducing the world to a collection of simple, extended particles ; but there is a widespread impression that by conceiving solids, liquids, gases, energy, electricity, as aggregates of units or charges, the laws of science can be made to apply to nature more simply and intelligibly than in any other way so far suggested. In line with this tendency there has developed the quantum theory of energy, the atomic theory of electricity, the dynamical theory of gases, in short, the whole kinetic theory of matter, together with a variety of hypotheses in chemistry and biol 11 Einstein, Relativity : The Special and the General Theory, tr. by Law son, j&gt;. ?l.</page><page sequence="8">3i6 THE MONIST ogy, where atomistic conceptions may be traced through Mendelian ism down to the latest speculations of heredity. In this connection, the opinion of Mr. J. M. Keynes expressed at the conclusion of his Treatise on Probability is worth quoting: that "the practical useful ness of those modes of inference on the validity of which . . modern science depends, can only exist?if the universe of phenomena does in fact present those peculiar characteristics of atomism . . which appear more and more clearly as the ultimate results to which ma terial science is tending."12 Indeed, if atomism be taken in its widest sense as signifying no more than the assumption that nature is re ducible to units of magnitude, it seems not too much to say that such atomism is everywhere a postulate of scientific method in so far as science attempts to derive equations, calculations, probabilities,?in short, mathematical results?from the study of nature. Only by as suming something like the atomistic hypothesis, it would seem, can we associate physical states with reckonable numbers and treat them by definite quantitative methods. In conclusion, the opinion may be reaffirmed that science is not, as Dr. Carr suggests, embracing subjectivism and monadic con ceptions, but is on the contrary steadily advancing in the objectivity of its methods and ideal. The important axiom of method is con stantly more clearly realized that experimental results are trust worthy in proportion as anthropomorphic elements, the 'personal equation/ and subjectivity (in so far as it defies objective control) can be eliminated. The physicist, the chemist, the zoologist, is, more over, conscious of studying an object that is no mere extrapolation of his own point of view or projection of the relations in his sen sations, but that has on the contrary its basis in universal, necessary conditions over which the private individual' mind as such has no determining control.
