This large settle- ment is dominated by two monumental architectural complexes, known as Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna1. These platform mounds are 500 m apart, and in between them lies a wide plain where both residential and craft production areas have been identi- fied (fig. 1). The Moche occupation of this site lasted into the second half of the first millen- nium a.D., or from Moche Phase I to Phase IV. Since 1991, the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo has been conducting a long-term investigation at the site. This project has three main objectives: the architectural and archaeological study of Huaca de la Luna; the conservation of its extensive architectural reliefs; and the promotion of local and regional tourism.2 This paper is an overview of the architecture and function of Huaca de la Luna (figs. 2, 3), understood today as the main ceremonial center at Moche. The Site of Moche On the western edge of the site lies Huaca del Sol (fig. 4), one of the largest structures known from the ancient Americas (340 m x 160 m). It consists of a series of four ascend- ing platforms, reaching the height of 40 m in the southern section. Its plan was originally that of a giant cross, but only one third of the monument remains today due to intensive looting carried out during colonial times. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the course of the Moche River was changed so that it would wash out the structure, making it easy to recover precious metal objects from burials encased within the platform. In mod- ern times this monument has received rela- tively little scholarly attention, apart from sporadic surveys and exploratory trenches. Claude Chapdelaine of the Université de Montréal has recently studied the urban plain between the huacas at Moche (Chapdelaine, this volume, and 1998). This area was pre viously thought to have been destroyed com- pletely by torrential rains and flooding as- sociated with an ENSO event (Moseley 1992: 167). Chapdelaine's excavations, however, have revealed the existence of a large resi- dential area composed of a series of architec- tural compounds. These compounds contain patios and storage facilities; a number of them also contain workshops. These com- pounds are connected by a system of plazas and streets. East of this settlement, on the lower slopes of Cerro Blanco, lies Huaca de la Luna. This complex consists of three large platforms on different levels, linked by adjacent plazas of varying size. The Huaca de la Luna complex extends 290 m from north to south and 210 m from east to west. Investigators have studied the Moche site since the turn of the twentieth century 47</page><page sequence="3">(Bennett 1939; Kroeber 1925, 1944; Lareo Hoyle 1948; Uhle 19 13; see also Kaulicke 1998). The most intensive period of investi- gation of this site, prior to the present re- search, was carried out between 1969 and 1974 by members of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project, directed by Michael Moseley and Carol Mackey (Moseley and Day 1982). Excavations were conducted near the huacas (Donnan and Mackey 1978) and in the resi- dential sector (Topic 1977, 1982). At Huaca de la Luna itself, however, only small-scale exca- vations were carried out. One of the major contributions of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project was the discovery of a series of superimposed mural paintings in the north- east corner of Platform I (fig. 5,- Mackey and Hastings 1982; see also below). In 1990 the author and Ricardo Morales initiated a long-term program of architectural study and archaeological excavations at Huaca de la Luna. This project involves the coopera- tion of numerous Peruvian and international scholars, as well as students from the Univer- sidad Nacional de Trujillo and the Université de Montréal. During the first years of our investigation at the site, our primary objec- tives were (1) to define the architectural i. Map of the Moche site opposite page: 2.

In subsequent years, Plazas 2 and 3 became the focus of our attention. In this paper I will first give an overview of the archi- tectural layout of Huaca de la Luna. This will be followed by a study of the architectural sequence of Platform I. In the final section, I discuss the activities carried out at Huaca de la Luna, in order to help us assess the nature and function of this monument in prehis- panic times. Architecture of Huaca de la Luna Huaca de la Luna consists of the following three architectural components (fig. 3): a large, elevated platform located in the southwest U CEDA 49</page><page sequence="5">4- View of Huaca del Sol Photograph by Edward Ranney (©) corner of the complex (Platform I); a smaller platform in the southeastern corner (Platform II); and a third platform in the northeastern corner (Platform III). The latter is detached from the main architectural compound and located on higher ground. Four plazas, at varying levels, are adjacent to the platforms. These are arranged as fol- lows: Plaza i, also known as the Great Plaza, is by far the largest of the three plazas (180 m X 90 m), and is located immediately to the north of Platform I (fig. 6). Contiguous to the east wall of this large open space is a long ramp, oriented north-south, that would have provided access to Platform I from the Great Plaza. Located to the east of Plaza 1, Plaza 2 is smaller and located at a higher level (3.5 m above Plaza 1). Plaza 3 is located in the south- ern part of the complex, between Platforms I and II. It is divided into three sectors (3 A, 3B, and 3C) and is characterized by the presence of a rocky outcrop that was incorporated into Platform II and Plaza 3A. Plaza 4 is located to the west of Platform III. The plaza spaces are delimited by the platforms and by free- standing, high, thick adobe walls. The west- ern wall of Plaza 1, together with the western façade of Platform I, formed a sort of southern 50 u CEDA perimeter wall, separating the huaca from the urban plain. On the south side of the huaca , the perimeter wall extends to the east, up the hill toward Cerro Blanco. The space between this wall and the southern façade formed a wide corridor (18 m in width and at least 180 m in length). Platform II and Plaza 3A, the location of a sacrificial site, have been studied by Steve Bourget (this volume, and 1998a, 1998b). Plazas i, 2 and 3C are the subject of ongoing studies under the direction of the author. We have focused the majority of efforts, however, on the Platform I. In broad terms, Platform I consists of a massive platform with an Upper and Lower Level (fig. 7). To date no remains of a kitchen or domestic debris have been uncovered on Platform I. Given the absence of residential evidence, and the character of the architecture itself, we suggest that Plat- form I was largely ritual in orientation. Platform I Platform I at Huaca de la Luna is a complex structure, built over the course of several centuries. In its final form, the huaca was a roughly square platform (95 m x 95 m),</page><page sequence="6">5 . Mural fragment, Platform I, Upper Level, Structure B, at Huaca de la Luna reaching some 32 m above the level of the residential plain. The exterior of the huaca is stepped (fig. 6). Remains of mural paint- ings and sculpted reliefs on the exterior of the huaca are similar to those found recently on Huaca Cao Viejo at the El Brujo complex (Gálvez and Briceño, this volume). Lines of warriors carrying shields and war clubs were sculpted in low relief on the northern façade of Huaca de la Luna, the façade facing the Great Plaza (fig. 8). As the tier where these reliefs are found narrows to accommodate the inclination of a ramp, the warriors are replaced by a serpent. Remains of mural paintings from an earlier north façade have also been found, including the depiction of a frontal anthropomorphic figure holding a tumi or crescent-shaped knife, with a grimacing mouth and curvilinear extensions terminating in profile bird heads (fig- 9)- Deep excavations on the huaca revealed at least five different construction stages, each involving the ritual burial of earlier struc- tures. Our most complete data on the archi- tectural layout of Platform I come from the last construction phases. Apart from some modifications noted below, it seems that the building largely kept the same layout over most of its history. As indicated earlier, the principal access to Platform I was by means of a large ramp, the base of which has been found in Plaza 1 . This ramp had an incline of 45 o, and an approxi- mate length of 60 m. It was 3.5 m in width and was flanked by a small low balustrade, 50 cm high (fig. 8). This ramp would originally have led to the fifth platform step, where it turned west and followed the huaca façade, reaching the top of the structure roughly at the center of the north façade (fig. 6). The Upper and Lower Level of Platform I are connected by a small L-shaped access ramp (fig. 7). After arriving at the summit of the platform from the plaza, one could follow this ramp to reach the Upper Level. Alterna- tively, one could follow a narrow, zigzagging corridor and eventually gain access to the Great Patio, which was decorated with im- pressive painted reliefs (figs. 10, 11), or other sectors of the Lower Level. Upper Level The Upper Level is a roughly square con- struction (40 m X 50 m), approximately 5 m above the Lower Level of Platform I. The Upper Level was badly damaged by intensive looting during colonial times. Nevertheless, the remains of walls indicate that it was origi- nally divided into four rooms. The small L-shaped ramp - documented in three of the five successive structures - pro- vided access to the Upper Level through a small room or terrace (16 m x 20 m) facing the Great Plaza to the north. This terrace pro- vided access to the other three rooms. The southwestern room contained a long bench against the north wall, and there is evidence of partial roofing. In the southeast corner there was a second room, a patio of 27 m x 16 m, with walls painted in white. A passageway on the north wall of this patio provided access to the third room. The walls of this third room were deco- rated with the mural paintings discovered in 1972 by members of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project mentioned above (fig. 5). This patio may have been one of the most impor- tant spaces on the platform, given its re- stricted access, and the quality of the mural decoration. Measuring 19 m x 16 m, the space UCEDA 51</page><page sequence="7">6. Hypothetical reconstruction of Plaza i and Platform I, at Huaca de la Luna Painting by Jorge Solorzano © Proyecto Arqueológico Huaca de la Luna had undergone multiple modifications. At one point, a long bench was constructed against the north wall. Evidence suggests that these modifications were carried out either for structural reasons, or possibly for the rit- ual burial of an older construction. The murals found in this precinct were repainted three times (Bonavia 1985: 85-97; Mackey and Hastings 1982). The earliest mural shows an anthropomorphic figure rendered in a rigid, textilelike fashion, apparently laid out over a grid. The figure is frontal, and holds a staff in each hand. The staves terminate in profile zoomorphic heads, of either a two- headed serpent or stylized feline. The figure wears a loincloth, decorated with a stylized serpent head, similar to that found framing each rhombus in the reliefs of the Great Patio of the Lower Level (fig. 11). This image, 3.4 m in height and 2.4 m in width, was repeated. Only the lower part of one of the figures is still visible today (fig. 5, lower section). 52 UCEDA A second mural was painted over the first (fig. 5, upper section). The format of the sec- ond phase mural is quite different, and fol- lows an overall checkerboard composition, with design blocks rendered in alternating colors. The basic design is of a disembodied supernatural face, with appendages extend- ing outward that terminate in profile bird heads. The motif was painted alternately in red over white, and yellow over blue. The eyes of the supernatural personage were detailed in black. The third and latest mural (Bonavia 1985: figs. 67-70; Mackey and Hastings 1982: figs. 4, 5 ) is a combination of the two earlier ver- sions: the subject matter of the first mural, but rendered in the checkerboard fashion of the second. As with the earlier murals, the forms are defined by the lines of an incised grid over the surface of the painting. The checkerboard composition here contains two design motifs arranged alternately on the</page><page sequence="8">wall. One is the anthropomorphic figure with zoomorphic staves, similar to the first paint- ing. The body of this figure is frontal, and the head is shown in profile. The headdress of the figure has volutes, and terminates in what may be representations of fox heads. The staves in the hands of the figure also termi- nate in zoomorphic forms, in this case ser- pent heads, with what are perhaps profile fox heads at the sides. The second motif is recti- linear, with stylized zoomorphic forms inter- spersed with anthropomorphic faces.3 Lower Level The Lower Level of Platform I is composed of three distinct sectors: (i) the Great Patio with painted reliefs; (2) a restricted area in the southwest corner, with rooms covered with sloping roofs; and (3) a smaller articulated court in the northwest corner (fig. 7). The Great Patio is a large open space measuring c. 2,400 m2, encompassing over a third of the structure and almost half of the Lower Level. The south, west and east walls were decorated with impressive painted reliefs (figs. 10, 11). The composition consists of a supernatural image, with a menacing, cross-fanged mouth, figure- 8 ears, and volutes encircling the face. Abbreviated zoomorphic forms, with whiskerlike barbels resembling those of a catfish, are above, below and to either side of the face. This in turn is enclosed within rhomboid borders, including one com- posed of interlocking stylized zoomorphic forms, repeated across the walls. The rhombi were 2.70 m x 2.80 m, vertex to vertex, thus covering most of the available surface of the walls (3 m in height). Similar depictions are known in other media in northern Moche art. Alva (1994) identifies the figure, seen in metal artifacts from Sipán, as the Decapi- tator. Lumbreras (1979: 121-123) notes that this image is frequently found in northern ceramics as well. The reliefs were probably made by a num- ber of artisans, as variations exist among them. The mineral-oxide pigments used in- cluded red, yellow, white, black, and blue. The reliefs were protected by an elaborate roof structure supported by algarrobo wood posts. Reeds were plastered and painted with 7.

Two small contiguous rooms in the south- east corner of the Great Patio were also orna- mented.4 The decoration consisted of motifs based on marine birds and fish (figs. 12, 13). Two basic designs alternate, with reversals in form and color. One shows a zoomorphic head with catfishlike whiskers, similar to 54 u CEDA those seen around the supernatural face in the larger reliefs in the main area of the Great Patio. The other is divided diagonally into two sections, one side repeating the zoo- morphic head, the other half bearing the image of a profile bird. Originally covered with a pitched roof, the interior floors and walls of these spaces had been painted white. Door- ways with high thresholds provided access to these precincts from the Great Patio.</page><page sequence="10">12, 13 - Details of painted reliefs from the southeast corner of the Lower Level, Platform I, Structures B-C, Huaca de la Luna 1 1 . Detail of painted reliefs from the Great Patio, Lower Level, Platform I, Structure D, Huaca de la Luna West of the Great Patio, in the southwest corner of Platform I, a series of rooms were found in what may have been one of the most private areas of the complex (fig. 7). Against the south wall were three contiguous small rooms. To the north were two relatively large rooms (6 m X 17.60 m and 19 m x 9 m). These spaces were originally covered with double sloping roofs, supported by pillars and pi- lasters. At Huaca Cao Viejo in the El Brujo complex, a large wooden post with a carved anthropomorphic figure was recovered from a similar type of room (see Gál vez and Briceño, this volume). The wooden figure from El Brujo wears a headdress with repre- sentations of two profile foxes. This finding in a similar and roughly contemporaneous site hints at the sacred character of these rooms. Finally, to complete the circuit of the Lower Level of Platform I, we arrive at the northwest corner. Here two large rectangular courts were located, overlooking the Great Plaza. Archaeological Evidence: Profile iC, Units 6, ii, 12 and the Looter's Tunnel Excavations carried out in recent years have shown that the architecture and orna- ment at Huaca de la Luna have been recon- figured over the years. The monument as we know it today, described above, corresponds to the last phases of construction. Five earlier construction phases have been identified, for a total of six major renovations. These super- imposed structures have been designated A-F, from latest to earliest. A certain homo- geneity in design was maintained throughout the construction sequence. Evidence for the architectural sequence comes from three U CEDA 55</page><page sequence="11">14- Canchero (dipper) found on Floor 3, Unit 6, Structure D, at Huaca de la Luna Diameter (body]: 15.7 cm; height: 8.5 cm; diameter (rimļ: 5.4 cm Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo Drawing by Carlos Ayesta sources (fig. 7): Profile iC, cleaned during the excavation of a looter's trench; a series of excavation units (6, n, and 12); and from findings during the study of a major, long looter's tunnel in the western façade of the huaca. Profile iC A large colonial-era looter's pit on the Upper Level of Platform I provided an occasion for studying the architectural sequence in this sector. Profile iC, located in the area of the small access ramp providing access between the Lower and Upper Levels, shows evidence of considerable architectural continuity between the later architectural phases. For example, the ramp maintained the same ori- entation and incline over the last three con- struction phases (from Structures C to A). Evidence of an earlier construction phase (Structure D) was found, showing a corridor in this area at that time, indicating that a reconfiguration of this sector occurred be- tween Structure D and Structure C. This was probably the time when the basic configura- tion of an Upper and a Lower Level on the summit of the platform was devised. A second key element seen in Profile iC has to do with construction methods. New building phases began with the burial of the previous construction; the existing building was covered with a thick layer of adobe bricks (approx. 2.5 m). Each new construc- tion completely buried the previous one. The one exception to this was Structure B, which suggests that this may represent a minor renovation rather than a complete recon- struction. Unit 6 The excavation of Unit 6 also provided important information on the construction sequence. Located in the western part of the Great Patio, this unit is the second deepest (8.5 m) trench excavated on top of Platform I. Three floors, associated with Structures A, B-C, and D, were identified. Important archi- tectural details of Structure D were defined, including a corridor with niched wall and a pillar. Fragments of a ceramic vessel known as a canchero (dipper) (fig. 14) were found on the floor of the corridor, providing a possible chronological indicator (see below). Units ii and 12 The exploration of a large colonial-era looter's pit inside the Great Patio also yielded impor- tant data on the architectural sequence. Units ii and 12 were relatively deep, cutting through the floors of Structures A-D. Evi- dence for painted reliefs from these last four phases were found along the eastern wall. Earlier remains, associated with Structure E, were also found in these units. To date, of all the excavation units, these are the only ones where almost all of the superposed construc- tions have been documented (Montoya 1998: fig- 3)- The Looter's Tunnel Beginning in the second half of the nine- teenth century, many large-scale clandestine excavations were carried out on the western side of the huaca in order to discover precious metals included in the burials in the plat- form. In several locations, looters had pene- trated horizontally into the monument, creating a series of tunnels of different size and extent.5 These tunnels provided a critical opportunity to analyze the earliest phases of the architectural sequence of the monument.

The entrance to this tunnel is located near the center the western façade of the huaca, and extends nearly 40 m underneath the monument. At its eastern end are two branches, one heading north for 10 m and the second heading south for 20 m. We were able to observe the existence of plastered walls and floors corresponding to the earliest con- struction stages of the huaca, as well as data on the transformations of the western façade over time. As we made our way inside the tunnel, a valuable piece of evidence came from the dis- covery of a succession of three outer walls corresponding to the western façade of earlier structures. These three plastered facings, painted with yellow pigment, were found at varying distances from the tunnel's entrance (at 15.6 m, 25.4 m and 35.2 m respectively). In other words, each time the platform was enlarged during these three construction phases, approximately ten meters of adobe bricks were added to the girth of the platform on this side, extending the western façade outward toward the urban plain. In keeping with the evidence encountered above, there appears to have been considerable architec- tural continuity in the last three phases, with no major changes in layout or ornamentation of the western façade. The Sequence of Architectural Superpositions The archaeological evidence demonstrates that Platform I was in use for a long period of time, with periodic reconfigurations. Here we may step back and consider the transforma- tion of the monument from its earliest his- tory (Structure F) to its latest incarnation (Structure A)6. The five major construction phases will be discussed in chronological order, from oldest to most recent (figs. 15, 16). Combining the evidence from the looter's tunnel and the excavations on the summit of the platform, some observations can be made regarding the nature of the sequential con- structions. The huaca increased in size with each phase, both in its horizontal and vertical dimensions. In addition to the ten meters added on to the sides of the construction, up 58 UCEDA Table 1 : Heights of Upper and Lower Levels of Platform I in relation to the plain.

Table 1 shows the relative heights of the Upper and Lower levels of Platform I during its different construction phases. The heights are measured from the residential plain, which is in turn about 70 m above sea level. Structure F Relatively little is known about Structure F, the earliest construction known at Platform I. As indicated above, the only evidence available for this structure comes from the looter's tunnel on the western façade of the huaca. This evidence has allowed us to define the western extent of the Structure F, as well as some floors. The western façade of Struc- ture F was located some 35 m inside the tun- nel, indicating that this structure was sub- stantially smaller than the one visible today, less than a third of its present size. The height of the platform was only 10.7 m above the residential plain. We have no information yet on the interior layout or decoration of Struc- ture F. Structure E Evidence for Structure E, representing the second phase of the construction sequence, comes from the looter's tunnel and the deep- est levels of Unit 11 (Montoya 1998). The western façade of this structure was identi- fied some 25 m from the entrance of the looter's tunnel, indicating that this building</page><page sequence="14">1 8. View of the Great Patio, Structures D (lower section) and B-C (upper section], Huaca de la Luna was io m larger than the previous one. Struc- ture E was approximately six meters higher than the earlier structure, at 16.75 m above the residential plain. Associated with Structure E is a feature not seen in the later architectural stages, namely a type of altar whose retaining walls were painted with parallel bands of red, black, and yellow (fig. 17,- Montoya 1998: 20). The data available suggest that the walls of Struc- ture E were not decorated but simply plas- tered and painted white. Structure D The façade of Structure D was found 15.6 m from the entrance of the looter's tunnel, again indicating an increase of about 10 m from the previous building. Evidence from Profile iC suggests that at this time a ramp between the Upper and Lower levels of the platform may have been constructed (at 24.2 m and 19.7 m in relation to the residential plain). The first evidence of painted reliefs in the Great Patio comes from Structure D (fig. 17 and fig. 18, lower section). In keeping with the later ver- sions of Great Patio reliefs, these show an anthropomorphic face in a rhombus, with zoomorphic motifs, either fish heads or styl- ized serpents, in the vertices of the rhombus. This central diamond-shaped form is then encased in a border of interlocking stylized zoomorphic forms, perhaps another version of the same creature seen in the vertices of the interior rhombus. This stylized creature is also repeated in the triangular spaces between the rhomboids. The discovery of the canchero or dipper in Unit 6 (fig. 14), mentioned above, has enabled us to suggest a relative date for this construc- tion.7 On the basis of this find, we tentatively propose that Structure D was in use during Moche Phase III. Structure C As with the earlier constructions, Structure C increased the size of the monument (the Upper and Lower Levels were respectively at 27.6 m and 23 m in relation to the residential plain). At this point, a standard orientation and incline of the access ramp between the Upper and Lower levels was established; this was maintained until the platform was aban- doned. An anthropomorphic figure with zoo- morphic appendages (fig. 9) was found on the north façade of this building, near the ramp. The Great Patio was rebuilt following a similar plan and its walls were adorned with painted reliefs (fig. 17 and fig. 18, upper sec- tion). Minor differences are apparent between the two stages (Paredes 1993; Uceda and Canziani 1998: 155). The basic format is retained, with the exception of the inclusion of what appears to be the same central face in the triangular spaces as well as in the rhomboids. The anthropomorphic face here uceda 59</page><page sequence="15">19- Ceramie duck-effigy bottle from Huaea de la Luna, Tomb II, Structure A Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo Proyecto Arqueológico Huaca de la Luna includes zoomorphic appendages. The small rooms with pitched roofs and ornamented walls in the southeastern (figs. 12, 13) and southwestern corner of Platform I were both associated to Structure C (cf. Navarro, Pare- des, and Rodas 1993: 54-59). Structure B In many respects, Structure B represents a minor renovation of Structure C rather than a full-scale rebuilding of the platform. The western façade of Structure C was retained, and there is little evidence that the overall size of the monument was dramatically increased in this phase. The murals found by members of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project (fig. 5) can be as- sociated with this construction phase. They are located in a room in the northeastern sec- tion of the Upper Level, where the floor is 29.8 m above the residential plain. On the Lower Level, excavations in the Great Patio showed that the floor of this structure (23.25 m above the residential plain), in con- trast to earlier constructions, had been laid immediately above the previous one, without any evidence of fill. Moreover, this new floor was associated with the wall with painted reliefs of Structure C. There is evidence of only minor remodelling and repainting of the figures (Paredes 1993). Structure A Structure A, the last construction phase, increased the size of the monument for the final time. A layer of adobe bricks, approxi- mately five meters thick, covered Structure B, increasing the height of the huaca. A new western façade was constructed, with a series of terraces (four of which are reasonably well preserved). Three of these had evidence of decoration, probably a continuation of the same lines of imagery seen on the north façade. On the northern façade, the ramp with a serpent in relief, and the reliefs of the warriors with shields and war clubs (fig. 8) was created. The general layout of both the Upper and Lower levels established in the earlier phases was largely maintained in Structure A. The Upper Level, now reaching a height of 32.2 m above the residential plain, was badly dam- 60 u CEDA aged by colonial and modern-era looting. Of the few remains of this construction, we have evidence of the access ramp and a corridor. The Lower Level (28.35 m above the residen- tial plain) was also largely destroyed, but remains of a floor were found, together with part of the decorated wall of the Great Patio. From what has been preserved, it is clear the general format of the earlier reliefs was con- tinued. A section with the frontal face in the triangular space has survived, along with a section of the stylized zoomorphic border.</page><page sequence="16">20. Correlation of structures with C-14 dates, ceramics In the fill underneath the floor of Structure A, a number of burial chambers were dis- covered. These graves have been discussed elsewhere (Tello 1997; Uceda et al. 1994). They have provided a means for assessing the relative date of Structure A. Grave goods found in Tomb II include a blackware stirrup- spout vessel representing a Muscovy duck holding a war club (fig. 19). The shape and decoration of this vessel are both typical of the Moche IV period in Larco Hoyle's chronology (1948). Ceramic vessels found in the other graves also pertained to the Moche IV phase, indicating that the last construction event at Platform I dates to this time. We were also able to obtain absolute dates for Structure A (fig. 20). Samples of organic material from the reed coffin of Tomb II, and from a wooden post associated with the floor of the Great Patio were submitted to the Gif-sur- Yvette laboratory in France. The reed sample from Tomb II (Gif-95 30) gave an age of 1,540 ± 50 years; the calibrated date, after Paz- dur and Michczynska (1989), corresponds to between a.d. 419 and 610, with a 95% confi- dence interval (2 sigmas). The sample from the wooden post (Gif-95 29) produced a greater age of 1,640 ± 40 years; the calibrated date fell between a.d. 271 and 522, with a 95% confi- dence interval (2 sigmas). These dates are in general agreement with others from Moche IV contexts at the Moche site (Chapdelaine, this volume, and 1998). The calibrated date of a.d. 419 to 610 from the reed coffin is rather late but acceptable. As for the date obtained from the post, a.d. 271 to 522 (calibrated), one possible explana- tion for its relative antiquity could be that this post had been taken from a previous structure and reused. If that was the case, this second date would have to be rejected. There- fore, it is proposed that Structure A was built during the Moche IV phase, in the sixth cen- tury A.D. To summarize, Platform I at Huaca de la Luna contains evidence of five major con- struction phases (Structures E, F, D, C, and A), with a less extensive renovation between Structures C and B. Over the years, it appears that Platform I generally maintained a con- sistent architectural layout with two main areas: an Upper and a Lower level, connected via a small ramp. The Upper Level was badly damaged by looting, so very little is known regarding its evolution over time, apart from the mural paintings from the northeast room discussed above. As for the Lower Level, its architectural history can be traced over the five main construction phases. The Great Patio in particular maintained its essential character through the various phases. From Structure E to Structure A, this space was continuously enlarged, but the relief orna- ment varied little from phase to phase. Struc- tures C, B, and A all retained the central supernatural visage first established in Struc- ture D. This continuity in iconographie con- tent and stylistic treatment continued over the course of the two centuries or more that separated the construction of Structure D from Structure A. The presence of this per- sonage, perhaps the Decapitator known from Moche III and IV ceramics (and occasionally found in Phase II), reinforces the association of these structures with Moche III and IV. Renovation of Power at Huaca de la Luna Study of the architecture of Platform I at Huaca de la Luna has shown that the monu- ment consists of a series of superposed uceda 61</page><page sequence="17">structures, largely following the same essen- tial layout over time. Access to the Upper Level remained relatively restricted, and the Great Patio was continually rebuilt as a large, open space decorated with impressive painted reliefs. In this section I consider possible motivations for the renovation of the temple at different moments in its history. As indicated above, each time Platform I at Huaca de la Luna was rebuilt, it involved the burial of earlier construction under a thick layer of adobe bricks. In a previous work (Uceda and Canziani 1993), it was postulated that torrential rain during ENSO events could have triggered successive reconstruction of this monument. Layers of sediment contain- ing remnants of paint were found in relation to different structures, indicating that the rain had washed the walls of this temple at various points in history. At these times, the disfigured murals on the outside façades and the painted reliefs of the Great Patio needed to be redone. New exterior facings were built and a thick layer of adobe bricks was laid on top of existing structures, maintaining the existing layout. In other words, an event like El Niño could have been the occasion for part of the process that resulted in the "regenera- tion" of Moche society. Nevertheless, recent excavations on Plat- form I, together with the study of earlier finds, have lead us to consider alternative explanations or perhaps complimentary fac- tors to the above interpretation of the reno- vations. We now feel that the rebuildings were linked to veneration of ancestors, and that the architectural renovations served to reinforce ancestral and priestly power at Huaca de la Luna. Following this hypothesis, each new structure was not a mere refurbish- ing event but a "réédition" of the whole structure. It is our view that in Moche society power came from the ancestors, and that the latter materialized themselves through their repre- sentatives, the priests. When a priest died, his replacement would have undertaken the con- struction of a new structure, where the de- ceased priest was then buried. The deceased priest would become a powerful ancestor, the monument would be energized by his pres- ence and the new priest would gain respect as the new living representative of the ances- tors. This new working hypothesis may be 62 UCEDA linked to the phenomenon of ritual burial of architecture known for some time in various parts of the Andes. This tradition, extending from the Archaic period to the Late Horizon, is characterized by the successive architec- tural renovations of ceremonial structures. This practice has been noted at Kotosh (Izumi and Terada 1972), Piruru (Bonnier, Zegarra, and Tello 1985), La Galgada (Grieder et al. 1988), as well at Formative period sites in Lambayeque (Shimada, Elera, and Shimada 1982) and lea (Canziani 1992). Support for this hypothesis of the regener- ation of the temple at Huaca de la Luna was found during excavations on Platform I. Analysis of Tombs I and II showed that both individuals buried were priests (Bourget 1994, I995; Uceda 1997a). The placement of their bodies within the temple may be seen as an action closely linked to the renovation of ancestors and, by extension, the renovation of power at Moche. In Andean cosmogony, the ceremonial burial of the dead forms part of the process of renovation, germination, and creation. This concept, widespread in the Andean region from the first agricultural societies, is a clear allusion to the germina- tion of seeds. Thus, the burial of the dead should bring germination in the form of the creation of ancestors. Both burial acts, human as well as archi- tectural, fulfill a basic function of social reproduction, and served to legitimate the power of the ruling elite. Nevertheless, ques- tions remain. Did the renovation of power have a cyclical character as it did in various ancient Mesoamerican cultures? Were the renovations concerned principally with a sin- gle paramount priest, or did they involve a group of priests? Although our current data are insufficient to answer these questions, future research may illuminate these issues. Ceremonies and Rituals Ideology and power in Moche society were strongly linked to the performance of cere- monies and rituals. Careful study of Moche religious practice should thus help us under- stand how the Moche articulated and con- structed power. Nearly a decade of excava- tions at Huaca de la Luna has provided a considerable amount of data clearly indicating that this architectural complex was mainly</page><page sequence="18">used for the performance of religious activi- ties (Uceda 1997b; Uceda and Paredes 1994). Excavations on Platform I have showed that the construction process was closely linked to the renovation of power through the burial of priests in Tombs I and II. Other buri- als have been identified within the fill cover- ing the last structure, again indicating the close link that existed between the construc- tion of the temple and the renovation of priestly power. It is important to emphasize that the priest's graves were not found in a distant cemetery but underneath the floor of the Great Patio. This large, open court was undoubtedly used as a ceremonial space for the performance of sacred rituals. Other spaces of Platform I were also devoted to ritual; rooms of different sizes were probably used as restricted areas for the priests and their attendants. Outside Platform I, other ceremonial precincts have also been identi- fied. Currently under study, Plaza 2 and Plaza 3B bear evidence of ritual practice (Baylón et al. 1997; Montoya 1997). Steve Bourgeťs excavations of Plaza 3A and Platform II have documented the exis- tence of a complex sacrificial site. According to Bourget (this volume, and 1998a, 1998b), rituals carried out in this space were overseen by a specific group of priests, a number of whom were eventually buried within Plat- form II. The skeletons that were found in Plaza 3 A were all adult males who had suf- fered fractures prior to their death (Verano, this volume). Victims had been put to death following a precise ritual sequence. Some bodies had been dismembered.8 Large, un- baked clay figures of nude prisoners, perhaps depicting the sacrificed individuals, were also found in the plaza. Two similar sculptures were also found in Plaza 3B to the west, indi- cating that this area was probably function- ally connected to the sacrificial site. Recent excavations in Plaza 3C revealed the exis- tence of another space where sacrificial prac- tices were carried out. Although study of Plaza 3C has not been completed, some dif- ferences from Plaza 3 A are evident: the bodies in this plaza were not dismembered, although some were decapitated and then defleshed. The general layout of Platform I at Huaca de la Luna, with its long access ramp leading to the Great Patio, would have offered an ideal space for the performance of rituals pre- ceding the sacrifice of prisoners in Plazas 3 A and 3C (see also Uceda and Paredes 1994). We hypothesize that the different spaces identi- fied at Huaca de la Luna were used for the per- formance of different types of rituals, some of which may have been related to the Sacrifice Ceremony, known from Moche iconography (Introduction to this volume, fig. 5; Alva and Donnan 1993: 127-141). This complex scene depicts the presentation of a goblet, presuma- bly containing the blood of sacrificed prison- ers, to a central individual. As a number of scholars have shown, this ceremony has clear correlates in the archaeological record. Graves of priests bearing the regalia of personages in the Sacrifice Ceremony have been found at Sipán (Alva, this volume), San José de Moro (Castillo, this volume,- Donnan and Castillo 1994) and Huaca de la Cruz (Arsenault 1994,- Strong and Evans 1952). Undoubtedly historic individuals played the roles of specific priests seen in the depictions of this ceremony and were eventually buried with the accouter- ments of their office. Until recently, however, there has been lit- tle speculation about where the ceremonies actually took place. We suggest that rituals bearing a strong resemblance to the Sacrifice Ceremony took place at Huaca de la Luna, and perhaps at other sites. Not only do we have the archaeological evidence of the cul- mination of the scene, the final dispatch of the prisoners in the plazas, we may also have indirect references to the earlier sequences of the ceremony depicted on the architecture itself. Representations of a parade of bound prisoners are found on the façade of Huaca Cao Viejo of the El Brujo complex (Gálvez and Briceño, this volume; Quilter, this volume), a structure that is in many ways similar to Huaca de la Luna, particularly in the pattern of architectural ornament. The north façade of Platform I at Huaca de la Luna is very damaged, but we hypothesize that similar prisoners were depicted on the façade here. Thus, the architectural ornament of the façade may refer to the very rituals that took place on and within the monumental architecture. Undoubtedly other types of rituals also took place at Huaca de la Luna. Evidence for other practices, however, is still slim. Coca seeds were found on a bench in front of a decorated wall in Plaza 2, suggesting some sort of propitiatory act. As yet, however, we uceda 63</page><page sequence="19">do not have the remarkable level of detail of specific rituals that we have for the Sacrifice Ceremony. Huaca de la Luna as Ritual Center The Moche site bears some of the largest con- structions of the prehispanic New World. The Huaca de la Luna complex was the major ritual center at the site, built and used over the course of centuries. It served as a locus for dramatic sacrificial ceremonies, interment of key ritual performers, and other activities. Platform I, the largest construction of the complex, contains evidence of five major con- struction phases, the last dating from the sixth century a.d. Huaca de la Luna has provided us with an unprecedented view into Moche ritual. Exca- vations at the site have confirmed that cer- tain practices known from the narrative scenes in Moche iconography indeed took place. The study of this monument, however, has expanded our understanding of Moche ritual practice, contributing data on aspects of Moche life that are not addressed in the fine-line paintings on Moche ceramics. Until recently, there has been little study of specific Moche sites or monuments over time,- we had developed a fairly good understanding of chronological change in Moche ceramics, but knew comparatively little about change over time in architecture. The evidence from Huaca de la Luna on the sequential construc- tion of the monument, and on the inclusion of burials linked to these constructions, has allowed us a new perspective into the mean- ing of Moche architecture and ritual. 64 UCEDA NOTES This project would not have been possible without the funding of Unión de Cervecerías Peruanas Backus &amp; Johnston. In particular we would like to thank Ing. Elias Bentin, President of the Board, Don Carlos Bentin, General Director, and Gilberto Domínguez, Regional Director. We are also grateful for the support of the municipality of Trujillo, especially Ing. José Murgia, mayor of Trujillo, and the regional government of the province of La Libertad, including Ing. Huber Vergara, and the corporation of public works of this province. The Universidad Nacional de Trujillo managed and administered the funds for the project. Our thanks to Dr. Guillermo Malea, past Rector, and to Mg. Eduardo Achútegui, Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, of this institution. My deepest and most sincere thanks are to the personnel of the Project, especially Ricardo Morales, Co-Director, archaeologists Maria Montoya, Ricardo Tello, José Armas, Moisés Tufinio, and artist, Carlos Ayesta. i . The Quechua term huaca has a variety of mean- ings, including a sacred place, a temple, an ancestor, or a mummy. Huaca is most often used to refer to sites traditionally held to be sacred in nature. The names Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna are not ancient, appearing only in travellers' accounts at the end of the nineteenth century. 2. Conservation and tourism issues have been dis- cussed elsewhere (Uceda and Mujica 1997, 1998). 3 . It is our view that these reliefs are entirely Moche in style as well as iconographie content. Previously scholars maintained that a checkerboard composition suggested an influence from the Wari culture of the southern highlands (Bonavia 1985: 85-97). As checkerboard compositions have been discovered painted on the sides of a Moche I tomb at La Mina in the Jequetepeque Valley (Narváez 1994), it appears that such ornament was found throughout the Andes and is not specifically indicative of Wari culture. 4. This space is also referred to as the recinto sacer- dotal (priests' enclosure) (Campana and Morales 1997). 5. In 1986-1987, the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, cleaned out and sealed these tunnels. Results of these interventions have not yet been published. 6. Structures A, B, C, and D correspond respectively to the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Stages in earlier publications (Uceda and Canziani 1993; Uceda et al. 1994). 7. This good-quality ceramic vessel is missing part of its base and handle. The body, slightly flattened and streamlined, measures 15.7 cm in diameter and 8.5 cm in height, with a diameter of 5.4 cm at the mouth. Finished in a cream slip, the upper part of the vessel is decorated with four panels containing a depiction of a zoomorphic form known as the Moon Animal, painted in red slip. Donnan (1973) studied</page><page sequence="20">approximately fifty examples of this type of vessel, although unfortunately only four came from scien- tific excavations. He identified two distinct body forms. One type is characterized by continuously curving sides without a distinct shoulder angle. The others have a sharp carination at their midpoint. Donnan also identified two types of handles: one is conical and tapers toward the tip; the second type is decorated with sculpted heads. Nevertheless, Donnan could not relate body form to handles, or the canchero form to a Moche stylistic phase. In the Virú Valley, William Duncan Strong and Clifford Evans documented four cancheros, three of which were from the tomb of the Warrior Priest (1952: Plate XXVII E and XXVIII J and L], one of the most elaborate Moche tombs known outside of Sipán. These three examples all correspond to the Late Moche period (Phase IV of the Larco sequence), and pertained to the Huancaco Red, White, Black (Strong and Evans 1952: 162-166), Red and White, and Gloria Polished Plain styles. The fourth canchero identified by Strong and Evans was a Carmelo Negative vessel from Burial 1 at the Gallinazo site (1952: 73 and Plate VII G). It is interesting to note that of these four vessels, two have carinated bodies, while two have continuously curving sides. Seven examples of cancheros were published by Donnan and Mackey, all pertaining to Phase IV and all having streamlined bodies (Donnan and Mackey 1978: 108, 126, 135, 156, 166 [M-IV 3, 27; M-IV 5, 26; M-IV 7, 6; M-IV 11, i; and M-IV 13, 4]). No diagnostic elements suggest an affiliation with ceramic phases in Larco's sequence (1948). Nevertheless, some elements of the canchero found in our excavations could be relevant for chronological purposes: (1) the size of the body is slightly smaller than all the forms described for Moche IV cancheros-, and (2) the designs are made with a thick brush and the colors are medium red. In size they would be similar to the Salinar and Gallinazo cancheros, while the color and use of thick brush - after Larco (1948) - would correspond to Moche III. A third element (3) is the presence of the Moon Animal. It has always been assumed that this representation comes from the Ancash highlands (Recuay style) and that it appears first in Moche Phase III (Luis Jaime Castillo, personal communi- cation, 1994). 8. The rituals carried out in Plaza 3 A would corre- spond to what Hocquenghem (1987) defined as the "punished" skeletons. BIBLIOGRAPHY Alva, Walter 1994 Sipán. Colección Cultura y Artes del Perú. Lima.
