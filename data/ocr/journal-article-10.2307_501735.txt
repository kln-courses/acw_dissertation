<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE Archaeological Institute of America (1964) The sixty-sixth general meeting of the Institute was held in Seattle on 28-30 Decem- ber 1964. Summaries of the papers presented are given in alphabetical order of the authors' names. ANCIENT VASES IN THE SEATTLE ART MUSEUM: D. A. Amyx, University of California. The Seattle Art Museum, world-famous for its treasures of Oriental art, should be better known also for its small but fine classical collection. This paper is concerned with the Museum's growing collection of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman pottery, which is being assembled with taste and skill, mainly through the benefactions of two donors, Dr. Richard E. Fuller, President and Director of the Museum, and Mr. Nor- man Davis. The vases, now amounting to some sixty pieces, have been wisely chosen for range, quality, and specific in- terest. Among the examples here presented by way of illustration, the following are most noteworthy: i) a Mycenaean (LH III A) three-handled jar, decorated with periwinkle designs; 2) an Attic Geometric high- lipped bowl with lid preserved, on its lip a "bird and birdseed" frieze; 3) a Cypriote Iron-Age (Bichrome IV) barrel-shaped jug, with a striking representation of a flying bird; 4) a Middle Corinthian cup of un- usual type; 5) an Attic black-figured neck-amphora of the Leagros Group, or near it, decorated with male and female dancers; 6) an Attic black-figured stemmed lekanis (a rare if not unique shape for this ware), its lid preserved, on the lid a frieze of horsemen; 7) an Attic red-figured cup, attributed to the Paris Gigan- tomachy Painter, decorated with scenes of banqueting and revelry; 8) a large Apulian red-figured amphora, showing, inter alia, Herakles among the Amazons, and a representation of a solo dance (oklasma); 9) an Etrusco-Corinthian oinochoe of distinctive style, the name-piece of the "Volunteer Painter"; and io) an Arretine pottery mold with dancers and musicians, bearing the stamp of the maker, M. Perennius Tigra- nus. The research on these vases will, it is hoped, lead eventually to their publication in a fascicule of the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum. SOME NEW EVIDENCE IN THE DATING OF THE Lu- RISTAN BRONZES: Guitty Azarpay, University of California. "Luristan Bronzes" constitute a relatively familiar category of grave goods, consisting mainly of weapons, articles of personal adornment, vessels, and horse trap- pings, which were discovered fortuitously or unsys- tematically in the Luristan region of northwestern Iran, from the third decade of this century. Since the appropriate context of individual pieces was unknown, scholars sought to place them in their proper historical perspective by investigations along the following lines: use of inscribed objects, the con- tent and style of the decoration, the function of the articles. While the inscribed articles gave a wide range of dates, from the III-II millennium B.c., the content and style of the decoration proved to be local fantasies and features which were comparable to ancient Meso- potamian art only on general grounds. The function and the portable character of the Luristan bronzes, however, suggested their attribution to the semi- nomadic Kassites of the II millennium B.c. who in- filtrated Mesopotamia from the east. The bronzes which bore inscriptions antedating the arrival of the Kassites were considered war trophies. A later opinion would substitute the Kassites for the Scytho-Cimmerians who entered Western Asia dur- ing the Iron Age, in the early part of the first millen- nium B.c. This substitution is supported by the pres- ence of quantities of iron articles among the Luristan "bronzes," as well as horse trappings used for saddle- rather than chariot horses. Recently discovered Iron Age sites in northwestern Iran, such as Marlyk, Hasan- lu and now Amlash, reveal additional support for dat- ing the bulk of the Luristan bronzes in the period of the Iron Age. Parallels between the burials from northwestern Iran and Luristan exist not only in the tomb inventory, but also in individual pieces (com- parison between anthropomorphic clay vessels from Amlash and Luristan), which suggest new and reward- ing areas of research in the art of Western Asia. ELECTRUM COINS FROM GORDION: Alfred R. Bel- linger, Dumbarton Oaks. A hoard of electrum coins found at Gordion in 1963 consists of twenty-six thirds, one sixth, and eighteen twelfths. All are part of the same type, the head of a lion to the right with open jaws, while on the reverse is a single punch mark for the twelfths, a double one</page><page sequence="2">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 165 for the larger denominations. It is generally agreed that these are products of the kings of Lydia of the late seventh and the sixth centuries B.c. but the place of their manufacture is unknown and this discovery adds one more item to the very slight evidence based on provenance. EXCAVATIONS AT MENDES, 1964: Bernard V. Bothmer, The Brooklyn Museum. Under the auspices of the American Research Cen- ter in Egypt and in cooperation with The Brooklyn Museum and The Detroit Institute of Arts, the In- stitute of Fine Arts of New York University began the excavation of ancient Mendes in the Nile Delta of Northern Egypt. The first campaign lasted from the end of May, 1964, to the second half of August. Field Director was Professor Donald P. Hansen of the In- stitute of Fine Arts. The capital of the Mendesian nome, known since the beginning of Egyptian history as the sanctuary of a ram god, the "Lord of Mendes," harbors the greatest ancient monument north of Heliopolis which has re- mained standing upright since antiquity, the mono- lithic granite naos inscribed for King Amasis (570- 526 B.c.). Here the dig was begun so as to recapture as much as possible of the plan of the Later Period tem- ple. A series of ten meter squares were opened by fol- lowing the east-west axis of the temple, approximately fifty meters north of the naos. The top level consisted of the debris of centuries of quarrying the temple and its foundations. Beneath this, the second stratum con- sisted of pure sand, and underneath came several meters of sub-foundations of hard packed earth mixed with pot sherds. Below it a stratum of occupational debris was entered, probably dating from the Old King- dom, and in probing further in the north portion of the temple precinct and to the west of the main tem- ple area an inscribed false door and two inscribed and painted limestone chapels were discovered which date from the late Old Kingdom. The type of these chapels is well known from similar decorated structures at Saqqarah (Jequier, Tombeaux de particuliers con- temporains de Pepi II). The early Old Kingdom level yielded a cylinder seal datable to Dynasty I and some four hundred flint tools and implements. FOUR BRONZE HYDRIAI IN THE METROPOLITAN MU- SEUM OF ART: Dietrich von Bothmer, Metropoli- tan Museum of Art. Since 1955, when a comprehensive article on the bronze hydriai in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was published in the Bulletin, four more bronze hy- driai, or component parts of hydriai, have come to the Museum. All are unpublished, except for the customary listing in the Annual Report. The earliest (57.II.x3), not unlike New York 54.II.2, is from the end of the sixth century B.c.; the late archaic or early transitional period is represented by a fine handle with the upper part of a woman (56.II.2); the third (57II.112), which bears two inscriptions is of the fourth century B.c.: the last (56.II.3), also of the fourth century, introduces a form and decorations unique among the ca. 250 hydriai of bronze that are known. None of the four hydriai in New York is included in the latest monograph on hydriai by Miss Diehl (Erika Diehl, Die Hydria. Formgeschichte und Verwendung im Kult des Altertums, Mainz 1964), and some of her generalizations will have to be modified in the light of these acquisitions. ISOTOPE STUDIES OF ANCIENT LEAD: Robert H. Brill, The Corning Museum of Glass, and J. Marion Wampler, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Isotope distribution ratios have been measured for thirty-five samples of lead from ancient objects made of lead, and twelve samples of galena ore from ancient mining areas. It was found that the isotope ratios of lead artifacts match the ratios of the lead ores from which they were derived. The measurements show further that the ancient leads studied can be divided into six distinct groups (or sub-groups) on the basis of their isotope ratios. These groups correspond in a useful way to geographical areas, since the differences in the isotope ratios are just a reflection of the dif- ferences in the geochemical histories of the various lead deposits. The groups are: L. Greece, Turkey and the Aegean; LLa. Northern and Central England; LLb. Southern England; LLL. Spain, Wales, Sardinia; LVa. Egypt; LVb. Saudi Arabia; V. Unique unmatching samples. Nature and history have not cooperated in such a convenient way that each ancient lead mine has its own unique isotope ratio. Isotopically similar leads often occur at widely separated distances, or over extensive areas. Nevertheless, the measurement of the isotope ratio of a lead of unknown origin can now be helpful. For example, such a measurement can be used con- clusively to disprove any of the above areas as possible sources for a given lead; or, with supporting informa- tion, to prove the source. The measurements were made with a solid-source mass spectrometer at the Brookhaven National Labora- tory. Ratios were determined of the four isotopes of masses 204, 206, 207 and 208. Only a few milligrams of sample are consumed in this type of analysis. The samples investigated consisted of metallic lead arti- facts, galena ores, slags or drippings, litharge, and lead extracted from ancient glasses and pottery glazes. The method can be applied just as well to lead corrosion products, pigments, lead extracted from alloys, or for that matter, to lead extracted from any other archaeo- logical material where it is presented in greater than trace concentrations. The technique offers one advantage over chemical analysis in that the isotope ratio is unaffected by the previous chemical history of the metal or the processes</page><page sequence="3">166 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 69 used for smelting and refining of the ore from which it came. The ratios can, however, be confounded by the re-use and mixing of leads from different sources. It does not seem likely at present that isotope analy- sis will prove helpful in the same way for the study of other metals. With the continuing accumulation of geochemical data and rapid refinements in instrumen- tation, however, the possibilities should be reviewed from time to time. THE LATER STADIUM AT ISTHMIA: Oscar Broneer, University of Chicago. Excavations in the Isthmian Sanctuary of Poseidon have taught us many new things about Greek athletics and athletic gear. Among the material evidence for the Isthmian Games are two stadia, one completely un- covered-so far as it is preserved-the second merely investigated. The earlier of the two, with its unique form of starting line, probably goes back to the fifth century B.c., and it contains evidence for a much ear- lier structure of as yet undetermined date. Because the earlier stadium encroached upon the temple area, it was abandoned near the end of the fourth century B.c., and its successor was constructed some three hundred meters to the southeast. It is this stadium that Pausanias saw and briefly described, and in it the Apostle Paul may have witnessed the Isthmian Games in the year A.D. 51. He probably had this occa- sion in mind when he wrote the Corinthians from Ephesus five years later: "Do you not know that in a race (literally in the stadium) all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it" (I Cor. 9:24). The stadium is located in a natural hollow and is now buried beneath an earth fill varying in depth be- tween two meters at the open end and more than six meters at the sphendone. By means of trenches and tun- nels, dug in 1962 and 1963, we have been able to dis- close its principal features and to obtain its over-all dimensions. It is one of the most carefully constructed of ancient Greek stadia, as well as the best preserved (excepting only the stadium at Delphi, which in its existing form is a Roman creation). The later stadium at Isthmia has some unusual features which promise to shed new light on Greek athletics. EXCAVATIONS IN CEOS, 1964: John L. Caskey, Uni- versity of Cincinnati. The third full campaign of excavation in Ceos, con- ducted by the University of Cincinnati under the auspices of the American School at Athens, began early in May and occupied three months. Progress was made toward an understanding of the topography of the principal site and toward solving various chrono- logical problems. At Ayia Irini new segments of the fortification walls were discovered, showing that the whole system was large and complex. The chief gateway on the eastern side led to an open square behind the inner end of the temple, near one entrance to the big house in Area A. Parts of the defensive works appear to have been con- structed as early as MMIII. Rebuilt and enlarged, they continued to serve through the LMIB/LHII period; it seems probable, though not yet certain, that they were abandoned in Mycenaean III, after the great earthquake. Certain of the houses in the town, but not all, were repaired and reoccupied in Mycenaean IIIA more or less in their original form. To this later period probably belongs a fragmentary slab of white marble with a representation of a warrior's head deftly drawn with incised lines; it was found built into a modern wall. This year it was learned that some walls of the temple (Area B) run deeper than we had supposed and that the earlier parts of the building must be dated in the Middle Bronze Age. It is becoming clear that much of the principal development at Ayia Irini originated in a time before the great houses of LM/ LH I-II. Further examples of Linear A script were found in early contexts this season, and one of the newly discovered graves yielded precious objects. During the season Miss E. Milburn made a thorough examination of imported and local pottery in several well-stratified groups, in connection with her studies as Olivia James Fellow of the Institute, and Mrs. M. Ervin drew up a detailed catalogue of the terracotta sculpture from the temple. A comprehensive study of the early site at Kephala has been undertaken by John E. Coleman. ROMAN STUCCO DECORATION: Michael Cheilik, Johns Hopkins University. In trying to establish a chronology for stucco, a form of Roman decoration that is difficult to date, one might turn to decorative moldings in stone and to paintings. Certain types of stucco designs closely parallel stone, especially architectural trim and exterior decoration; but often this represents a cheap imitation and will thus not be dealt with. In the case of interior decoration, stucco is an inde- pendent form, an alternate to paintings on walls and ceilings. As a result I have been able to establish a chronology of stucco work by close comparison with Roman paintings. The First style, a fusion of painting and stucco, imi- tates stone and can be set aside. From the mid-first century B.c. to A.D. 79 the Second, Third and Fourth styles evolve; later decorations will be categorized by their equivalent form in painting during the time of each emperor. The Second style, on ceilings, uses rectilinear compartments with finely executed figures. The Third style introduces wall designs, generally articulating vertical candelabra. By the time of Nero fantastic architectural shapes closely parallel the Fourth style in painting, and centrally conceived ceiling de- signs appear. The repertory of stucco decoration in- creases throughout the empire and new motifs are added to its vocabulary. Few of the older designs are lost, but they undergo metamorphoses.</page><page sequence="4">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 167 MIDDLE BRONZE AGE BURIALS ON CEOS: John E. Cole- man, University of Cincinnati. Excavation on the promontory of Ayia Irini on Ceos in 1964 brought to light nine burials assignable to the Middle Bronze Age, the first prehistoric burials defi- nitely recognized at this site. They are situated in two groups, one on the west side and one on the east side of the former neck of the promontory. Each group lies just outside but at a lower level than the earliest fortification walls. The first group, that to the west, definitely formed a small cemetery and consisted of five jar burials and two small cist graves. The jars were closed by stone caps. Some were decorated with Matt paint. Skeletal remains here were scanty but the small dimensions of the jars and the cist graves indi- cate that all were infant burials. None contained offer- ings. The second group, that to the east, consists at present of two cist graves (although more may be expected since the area opened at this level was small). The smaller of the two was slab-sided and contained, besides the remains of a skeleton, a jug and a stone bowl. The larger grave was built above and in a cleft of bedrock and had a well finished cover slab. It be- longed to a girl about 12 years old and was sumptu- ously furnished, containing, in addition to several pots, a diadem of gold and a necklace of gold and semi- precious beads, both of fine and delicate workmanship. It is thus the richest grave found in a Middle Helladic or Cycladic context. These graves give us a good picture of the manner of burial at this site in the Middle Bronze Age. The richness of the last mentioned testifies to its importance in that era. RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN ISRAEL: Immanu- el Ben-Dor, Emory University. During the period under review, i.e. during the years 196o-1964, archaeological activity was on the increase in Israel. Detailed plans were made for a complete archaeological survey which will begin in 1964 and will be carried out jointly by the Department of Antiquities and other archaeological bodies. New areas were investigated in the south (Negev). I. The excavation at Ein Gedi, near the Dead Sea revealed a chalcolithic and an Iron Age settlement. Important inscriptional material was recovered here as well as small objects of interest. 2. A large scale excavation was undertaken at Arad, a city occupied at the beginning of the Early Bronze period (3000-2700 B.c.) and again during the second part of the Iron Age, and most remarkable was the find of an Israelite sanctuary and of a number of Ostraca. 3. The fortress of Masada, built on an almost in- accessible rock, was attacked successfully by the ex- cavators and is being dug and reconstructed at the same time. Interesting mosaic pavements were dis- covered, among the earliest ever found in Palestine; also fragments belonging to the category of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 4. The excavation of the coast city of Ashdod re- vealed extensive evidence of Philistine occupation. Parts of a royal Assyrian inscription were found. The mound of Najileh, north of Beersheba, was dug, and served as training ground for American students organized as a regular Summer School. 5. In the north were several excavations, the Iron Age city near Ein Gev, on the Lake of Galilee; the Town of Akhzib with remains ranging from Middle Bronze to Persian period as well as Phoenician tombs; an early Christian church at Shaves Zion, with mosaics; a synagogue near Tiberias with mosaics. THE GREATER DEMARKHIA AT ERKHIA: Sterling Dow, Harvard University. Early in 1964 G. Daux published the Sacred Calen- dar of the Deme Erkhia in the Attic Mesogaia. Some 335 lines in length, and almost completely preserved, it is one of the most important inscriptions of the last several years. The heading is AHMAPXIA H MEKITN. The sacrifices are given in five columns, headed respectively A, B, F-, A, E, and concluded by totals for costs of victims. These features were and apparently still are une aposie, but a solution, clear and logical and historically accurate, is I think possible (see BCH 1965).

Fleischer, P. B. Price, and R. M. Walker, General Electric Re- search Laboratory. Fission track dating has been shown to be capable of dating glasses and crystalline materials from 20 years to more than a billion years ago, depending on the uranium content of the material. This dating method, in which the fraction of uranium impurity atoms that have spontaneously fissioned is measured by counting the resulting damage tracks (which are displayed by a simple chemical etching procedure), has shown several areas of usefulness for archaeology and prehistory: i) Many ordinary man-made glasses as young as 2,500 years contain enough uranium to be dated. 2) Special decorative glasses to which uranium has been added as a colorant may be dated if they were melted 20 years or more ago. 3) Natural glass artifacts which have been heated or remelted by man can be dated to give the time of heating. 4) The time of existence of a hominoid can be found by dating natural glass lava flows whose melting was contemporaneous. Illustra- tions of items i) to 4) will be presented.

OBSERVATIONS ON COMPLETING THE ALBUM OF DATED LATIN INSCRIPTIONS: Arthur E. Gordon, Univer- sity of California. Observations ranging from the sublime (the text of the Arval Hymn) to the ridiculous (the change from K. to Kal, in abbreviating Kalendae), in the fields of lexicography, orthography, text criticism, onomastics, and epigraphy proper, with special reference to chrono- logical development, in the inscriptions of Rome and the neighborhood, from the late Republic to the sixth Christian century. THE EXCAVATION OF HEBRON, 1964 SEASON: Philip C. Hammond, Princeton Theological Seminary. El-Khalil, the site of ancient Hebron, is one of the last major historical sites of the Palestinian area. Se- rious difficulties precluded any attempt at its excava- tion, in spite of its importance, until the present time. As a consequence, however, the site remained intact for the application of modern scientific archaeological techniques-a situation found at few major sites of biblical interest in the Near East. After a preliminary survey in 1963, the American Expedition to Hebron conducted its first season during the summer of 1964. The expedition uncovered ma- terials which fully justified the expectations of archaeo- logical data potentially to be found at a site docu- mented from very early times and possessing the geographical, climatic, and strategic features which generally indicate ancient occupation. The main concentration of activity during the first season was upon Jebel Er-Rumeide, across from the modern city. This area produced materials ranging from Medieval Islamic (Ommayid-Ayyubic) to Chal- colithic-Neolithic times. Iron I-II and Middle Bronze II materials were also significantly great, supporting the known documentary history of the site. Proton mag- netometer surveys further indicated areas to be inves- tigated in successive seasons. EXCAVATIONS AT SARDIS, 1964: George M. A. Hanf- mann, Harvard University. Excavations in the city brought promising results for the Lydian and Persian eras in the sector "Pac- tolus North," where an area unencumbered by later buildings yielded the best preserved Lydian dwellings yet found. Refinement of stratification was obtained by a section dug in the other major Lydian area, the "House of Bronzes." The first Lydian dipinto, possibly a dedication to Lydian Zeus was found. Levels of the ninth or tenth century B.c. were reached. Two large trenches run downhill immediately south of the "House of Bronzes" sector clarified the topog- raphy of the region in Roman and Early Byzantine times. A new major artery came to light in a colon- naded street which ran northward from the Pactolus toward the main avenue of Sardis. The eastern facade of the Synagogue and the ad- jacent area were excavated. Evidence was found that in the sixth century A.D. the eastern end of the Syna- gogue was rebuilt to serve as Byzantine fortification. Rooms uncovered to the west of the Synagogue may belong to it: one had a painted inscription, "Praised be the Lord." The large project of restoring the great entrance court of the Roman gymnasium was begun and the reconstitution of its dedicatory inscription (211/212 A.D.) was accomplished. A flanking unit to the south was excavated, and a unit to the west par- tially exposed. The latter may be the aleipterion men- tioned in the dedication. Soundings revealed that huge barrel vaults were used to support the palaestra as part of the complete releveling of this quarter after the earth- quake of 17 A.D. On the north slope of the citadel an additional stretch of the tunnel which descends from the top within the cliffs was freed. Decisive evidence for the original date and ultimate purpose is still lacking, but use in the Middle Byzantine period is proved by a coin of the twelfth century A.D. Ten miles away, in the Royal Cemetery of Bin Tepe, two months of tunneling into the large central mound failed to locate the grave chamber but produced an- other surprising result. The mound, which on evidence of Hipponax should be that of king Gyges (685-652 B.C.), contains a smaller inner mound encircled by a crepis of monumental masonry. A monogram carved ten times on this limestone wall is deciphered by the excavators as Gugu, the name under which Gyges ap- pears in the Assyrian annals. A vast system of ancient tunnels dug into the mound from the south appears to be Roman; it, too, failed to reach the grave chamber. WHO WAS WHO IN THE EAST PEDIMENT OF THE PARTHENON: Evelyn Harrison, Columbia Univer- sity. Carpenter has convincingly demonstrated that the center of the East Pediment of the Parthenon was occupied by a single great statue, which can only have been the seated figure of Zeus. The Madrid Puteal, with Athena and Hephaistos flanking such a figure, could well be an authentic reflection of the original composition except that the profile pose of Zeus gives the throne a prominence that is awkward for the composition and out of tune with the style of the pedi- ments. Enthroned figures in paintings and reliefs of the fourth century suggest a solution. If Zeus sat in a semi-relief pose, with the back of the throne and his upper torso parallel to the tympanon, his head turned toward Athena and his feet toward Hephaistos, the three figures would be more closely linked than in the Neo-Attic relief and the throne less obtrusive. The floor-marks in Block 14 suggest that Athena moved</page><page sequence="6">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 169 diagonally outward, and we can assume that the pose of Hephaistos in Block 12 was similar. The placement of Hera in Block ix is no longer a bar to a symmetri- cal center group. Altogether there is room for more figures than Car- penter and Berger assumed. We may tentatively restore the following: Helios, Herakles, Kore, Demeter, Arte- mis, Apollo, Leto, Dionysos, Hera, Hephaistos, Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, Amphitrite, Hebe, Ares, Hermes, Hestia, Dione, Aphrodite, Selene, twenty-one in all. Neighbors are linked by meaning and mythology and often by blood relationship. A number of mothers ap- pear with their children. There seems also to be a grouping of divinities according to the locations of their Athenian sanctuaries. The south wing contains those whose shrines were near the Ilissos and south of the Acropolis, the north wing those of the north side of the Acropolis, the north slope and the Areopagus. A CALENDAR OF SACRIFICES OF ELEUSIS: Robert F. Healey, S.J., Boston College. A careful examination of the actual stones on the spot (at present in the Apotheke of Eleusis), and fresh, clear squeezes provide a new and enlarged text of IG II2 1363, a Calendar of Sacrifices of Eleusis. Several new and important readings and restorations, and new interpretations of words already read but not previ- ously correctly understood, together with a comparative study of the other Calendars of Sacrifice of Attika, permit a new understanding of the prescriptions of the extant lines, as well as of the Calendar as a whole. A solution is proposed for all the major problems of the document. The extant lines constitute, in part or entirety, four panels, dealing respectively with four major festivals: the Proerosia, the Pyanopsia, the Thesmophoria, and (quite possibly) the Skira. The prescriptions for the Proerosia concern its solemn prorresis in Athens: those for the Pyanopsia, the participation of the Eleu- sinian personnel, including the "Priestesses from Eleu- sis," in the festival at Athens; for the Thesmophoria, sacred activity at the megaron at Eleusis and "sacred banquets and baskets" for the Thesmophoria as well as a perquisite for the Priestess of Plouton (not previously known); finally, the lines dealing with the Skira are so badly damaged that not much can be made of them. In addition, individual entries supply us with the epithet of Pythios for Apollo at the Pyanopsia, the meaning of Progonion or "sacred table-cloth" for the table used in his worship, and the presence and mean- ing of the megaron at Eleusis. The Calendar as a whole is a supplementary one, providing for minor expenses omitted from the prin- cipal Calendar of Sacrifices of Athens, or local pre- scriptions not included in it. A HELMET TOMB-GROUP OF THE TREBENISCHTE TYPE: Dorothy Kent Hill, The Walters Art Gal- lery. The Walters Art Gallery recently acquired a bronze helmet together with five pieces of sheet gold, com- prising a grave-group similar to those from Treben- ischte and recognizable as characteristic of the northern part of the Greek peninsula in the late archaic period. The helmet is of "Illyrian" type, that is, it has a rectangular face-cutting and long, immovable cheek pieces, each pierced by a hole near the tip while all edges have a bead pattern. It is of unusually large size, well preserved, bearing a thick green patina. As usual, there is a frame running lengthwise of the head for fitting a crest, and a loop at back and a projecting rod at front for tying this crest in place. The gold mask was made in two parts. One which forms the major part of the face has eyes, brows and mouth worked by hammering sheet gold into a matrix; the mouth has a decided archaic smile; there are no ears. The second piece is but a sheet of foil which was folded to form a nose and attached by five stitches of gold wire, the ends of which are marked by holes in the nose and in the mask proper. A narrow band of gold, ornamented by double spiral band, is of the right length for a diadem; it has now been re-used to help mount the mask on a block within the helmet, even though the mask must be dropped lower than is nor- mal if the diadem is to be visible. The other objects are a finger ring, very light and without ornament, and a sheet-gold plaque of diamond shape with rosette and borders rendered in low relief. Plaques of this form have sometimes been interpreted as diadems, but in this case, where an unmistakable other diadem exists, it probably is correct to call the diamond plaque a breast ornament. The gold pieces are all more or less red in color. The discoloration may indicate secondary burial, by which bones, partially burned and still warm, were arranged in the grave in the position of an inhumation burial, with the skull inside the helmet. Such burial methods were recognized on the occasion of the second discovery at Trebenischte (JOAI 27 [1932] Iff) al- though similar evidence was not found by the excava- tors of the first and largest group of graves (B. Filow, Die archaische Nekropole von Trebenischte, 1927). While there cannot be certainty that the Walters group is complete and cohesive, the helmet and the five gold objects form a normal group. Variations in style, type and motif from north-Greek grave-groups previously discovered are slight indeed. The rite of burial with the mask, originally Mycenaean and gen- erally abandoned before Greek times, continued for many centuries in the north; gold masks have been found in graves in the Black Sea area from as late as the fourth century B.c. THIE GEOMETRIC PERIOD IN ETRUSCAN HISTORY: Clark Hopkins, University of Michigan. According to the history books, the Etruscan culture succeeded the Villanovan in central Italy during the seventh century B.C., the period in which belonged the</page><page sequence="7">170 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 69 rich tombs of Tarquinia and Caere (the Warrior, the Bocchoris, and the Regolini-Galassi), of Praeneste (Bernardini and Berberini) and Vetulonia (the Circle Graves). Much of the furniture of the Warrior Tomb and the Circle Graves, however, was very closely re- lated to the bronzes of the Villanovan period. There is the possibility, therefore, that an earlier development of Etruscan preceded the recognized Etruscan culture of the golden tombs and that part at least of the so-called Villanovan culture belonged to this earlier phase of the Etruscan. A study of the incised decoration of Villanovan pottery and of the bronzes, particularly the belts, the elaborate horses' bits, the shields and the tripods sug- gests that the greater part of the Villanovan art and metal work belonged to Etruscan artists and artisans. Early Etruscan culture may, therefore, be divided into two sections, the first characterized by horses' bits and stylized figures which might be called the Geometric- Cavalry section, and the second, distinguished by the richer tombs and heavier armor which may be styled the Orientalizing-Hoplite phase. PULLING HERAKLEs' LEG: Seymour Howard, Uni- versity of California, Davis. It is well known that many restorations of ancient sculptures from the Renaissance on drastically altered the appearance of antiquities. Restoration during these centuries had an interesting history, for restorers and their patrons, despite usual license, increasingly prided themselves on the accuracy or seemingly antique char- acter of their additions and alterations. This prepared for recent attitudes toward antique sculptures and their restoration. There is an especially interesting case in which Fra Guglielmo della Porta, restorer for the Farnese family in the mid-sixteenth century, during the infancy of restoration's history, supplied a missing leg for the recently discovered colossal Lysippan Herakles by Gly- kon. Shortly afterward, the original leg was found; no less a person than Michelangelo reportedly asserted that the substitute (and hence contemporary craft) was equal to the original and should stand in its place, and so it did. In the next century, the great Roman Baroque sculp- tor Alessandro Algardi, who had become equally fa- mous as a classicist for his restoration of the Ludovisi sculptures, was commissioned to restore the Herakles and Hydra now in the Capitoline Museum. He ap- parently removed, or ignored, the rather modest an- cient leg of the figure to add a very elaborate and flamboyant Hydra, enlarging the sculpture to a major group. Here, apparently, was a deliberate attempt to rival the fame and excellence of the older restorer; and, as in the other case, the ancient leg was displayed next to the restored work. Though the Algardi restoration still remains as it was in the early eighteenth century Capitoline collec- tion, the Farnese piece at the end of that century was in fact renovated in preparation for its movement to Naples. In accord with what has become modern prac- tice and the attitudes to the antique that were develop- ing after 1750, the della Porta leg was removed and the antique one replaced. This was the work of a tractable professional restorer of more contemporary aspect, Filippo Tagliolini. A NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE FRAGMENTS OF IG 112, I951: Donald R. Laing, Jr., Western Reserve Uni- versity. The accepted arrangement of the major fragments of IG II2 195i and the interpretation of the inscription based upon this arrangement must be abandoned. Measurement of the exact widths of the columns of names on fragments "f" (EM 438) and the four joined fragments "h+a+b+i" (EM 12366, 8060, 8063, 12365) has shown that one cannot place "f" with its four columns over the corresponding first four col- umns of the joined cluster. There is a concrete and notable discrepancy between the widths of columns supposedly identical. However, by moving the newly joined fragments "c+f" and the smaller fragments associated with them ("d,e,g,j,k") from a position above "h+a+b+i" to a position well below them and one column to the left one achieves a consistency of column width while retaining an undisturbed tex- tual continuity. This new arrangement and the evi- dence which can be drawn from the position of simi- lar headings in consecutive columns of the text greatly alter our conception of the original size of this stele. One must now conclude that there was space for over four times as many entries as hitherto thought, in- volving the crews of eight triremes. The impressive size and the unique character of this text demand an extraordinary and important occasion for its erection. Such an occasion can be found and I shall develop and discuss the argument concerning its identification in a future paper. THE PROTOCORINTHIAN AND CORINTHIAN WELL AT ANAPLOGA: Patricia Lawrence, University of Ore- gon. In May, i962, a well of the Archaic period was ex- cavated in the area of a Roman building at Anaploga, between Old Corinth and Agioi Anargyroi. Its unusual importance for the study and interpretation of Corin- thian pottery is due to several features rarely present in groups of excavated pottery. Its depth, 24.85 m., ex- ceeds that of most Archaic wells. It was tightly packed with pottery, so that the contents appear not to have shifted very much in the course of time, and coarse ware is associated with datable fine ware through its entire depth. Terracotta figurines and lamps, occurring sporadically in close association with the pottery, in some cases can be dated relatively to the vases more exactly than was previously possible for the types in question. The Protocorinthian pottery, the earliest of which at the bottom of the well is Middle Protoco-</page><page sequence="8">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 171 rinthian, appears to represent random, gradual filling of the shaft. Vases in the Transitional style are scarcely present. In the period of Corinthian animal styles the well shaft was certainly a potters' dump, of one large establishment or of several, representing a distinct seg- ment of the industry. Most important are the series of oinochoai, of the standard trefoil-mouthed model and variant types; one of these, previously known only from isolated examples, is illustrated here by twenty- seven vases showing its development from Early Corin- thian to the beginning of Late Corinthian. There are numerous kotylai and cups, but other shapes are rare or absent. All of the vases, figured or black-glazed, of the Corinthian period are misshapen or misfired; they were discarded as unsalable but are unusually well preserved for the study of shapes and styles. The well provides an opportunity, unique to date, to relate plain and figured vases in continuous series through- out the period when the Corinthian pottery industry was at its height with respect to prosperity and its influence on other fabrics. The Early Corinthian pe- riod is particularly well represented. The latest vases, at the top of the well, show an early stage of the Late Corinthian style; therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that the well shaft was filled by ca. 560 B.c. EXCAVATIONS ON SAMOTHRACE, 1963-1964: James R. McCredie, Institute of Fine Arts, New York Uni- versity. The excavations of the American School of Classical Studies in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samo- thrace were continued in 1963 and 1964 by the Archaeo- logical Research Fund of New York University. Clearing of the stoa (AJA 67 [1963] 214) was vir- tually completed. Its foundations and the enormous number of blocks of its superstructure which have been recovered make a detailed reconstruction of the build- ing, a simple, single-storeyed, Doric stoa with an Ionic interior colonnade possible. Evidence for the earlier condition of the Western Hill now makes clear the important change in the appearance of the sanctu- ary caused by the erection of this large stoa in the Hellenistic period. Investigation of the "Ptolemaion," the unique Ionic propylon built by Ptolemy II (285-246 B.c.), was be- gun. In addition to details of the structure and design of the building, excavation has provided confirmation of K. Lehmann's suggestion that a wooden bridge spanned the torrent bed connecting the propylon with the sanctuary proper. The investigation of the abut- ment for this bridge on the Eastern Hill of the sanc- tuary led to the discovery of the foundation and lowest wall-course of a round building, ca. I4.60 m. in diameter, which had been buried under the abutment. Conclusions and details must await further excavation, but it seems probable that this building was the prede- cessor of the great Rotunda of Arsinoe II built be- tween 289 and 281 B.c., and that the new site of the latter was necessitated by the reorganization of the en- trance to the sanctuary, in connection with which Ptole- my's propylon was built. That more structures stood in this eastern area of the sanctuary is shown by the discovery of elements of the superstructure of a large- scale Doric building and fragments of Corinthian capi- tals. EXCAVATIONS AT KARATAS-SEMAYiUK IN LYCIA, 1964: Machteld J. Mellink, Bryn Mawr College. Report on the second season of the Bryn Mawr Col- lege excavation of an Early Bronze Age site in the plain of Elmali (cf. AJA 68 [1964] 269-278). About seventy more jar-burials were cleared. The habitation site to the north of the cemetery was also investigated. It is not a village but a complex consisting of a rectangu- lar house set in an oval courtyard, fortified in several stages. The first building stage is about contemporary with Troy I; after a destruction and conflagration the complex was rebuilt and used in the Troy II period, after which the site was abandoned. THE METONIC CYCLE IN ATHENS: Benjamin D. Mer- itt, Institute for Advanced Study. There has been a general belief that the astronomi- cal calendar of Meton was disregarded by the Atheni- ans in their civil reckoning of time. There is, however, evidence to show that the Athenian civil calendar sometimes followed the pattern of Meton's 19-year cycle and that his astronomical calendar was actually, at times, used as a guide, in terms of reference, for the civil calendar. PANAKTON: Irwin L. Merker, Rutgers University. One of the more vexed areas in the study of Attic topography is the northwest frontier. Here there has been controversy over the assignment of the names pre- served in the ancient authors and inscriptions to their proper sites. Panakton, which is mentioned in Thucy- dides, has been one of the most disputed problems. On the basis of the literary, epigraphical and archaeological evidence an attempt is made to show that Panakton is not to be placed at the ruins called Ghyphtokastro above the old road from Athens to Thebes, which is Eleutherai, but at the kastro above Kavasala and Ka- koniskiri in the Skourta Plain. PRAYERS OR CURSES? SOME LEAD TABELLAE FROM MORGANTINA: Ned Nabers, University of Kansas. During the excavations at Morgantina carried out by Princeton University under the direction of Profs. E. Sj6qvist and R. Stillwell during the 1962 and 1963 seasons a total of nine inscribed lead tabellae were found in connection with the clearing of the chthonian sanctuary in the southwest quarter of the Hellenistic agora. All of these tabellae except one were found rolled up with the inscribed face to the inside. The</page><page sequence="9">172 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AIA 69 inscriptions are written in Greek and are addressed to Earth, Hermes, the chthonian gods, and in one in- stance to Pluto, and request these deities to admit or receive (potidexesthe) a person or persons named on the tablet. Although these tabellae have many of the charac- teristics of defixiones it is suggested that these tabellae are not curses directed against living persons, but rather prayers for the kindly admission to the underworld of persons already dead at the time the lead sheets were inscribed and deposited in the sanctuary. Supporting this view are not only the differences in tone and wording between the Morgantina tabellae and defi- xiones from various parts of the Greek world, but di- rect verbal parallels with grave stelae (Roberts, Coll. Froehner 120-121; SEG 8.799, 5-6) and two passages from fifth century Attic drama (Soph., Phil. 819; Eur., Alc. 742-744) where there can be no doubt of the in- tention of the prayers. ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURE AND DECORATION IN Ro- MAN OSTIA: James E. Packer, San Fernando Val- ley State College. With regard to Ostian structural and decoration devices, two questions may be asked: i) can the dif- ferent features be divided into subcategories; and 2) were these features and their subdivisions used on par- ticular buildings, or were they employed irrespective of building type on all varieties of structure? Ostian doorways can be typed by size and/or by the form of the lintel. Windows may be similarly classified on the basis of their lintels. Generally two stairway types were used, according to the amount of street frontage available to the builder. On the other hand, the placement of the three Ostian balcony forms ap- pears to have been dictated by structural requirements. Although covered arcades were normally associated with rows of shops, such shops were ranged along the faqades of baths, horrea, or apartment houses. The prevailing forms of Ostian external decoration are the embellishment of entrances, the use of mold- ings, and the type of general finish applied to the ex- terior surfaces of a structure. The most usual decora- tion for doorways consisted of two columns flanking the entrance and supporting a pediment. This standard ornamental form may be subdivided into three types. Ostian moldings fall into two general classifications, simple and complex, each of which may likewise be broken down into a number of distinct types. All mold- ings were of terracotta, most of them mass-produced, and all were used according to the fancy of the builder. Finally, it cannot be dogmatically stated that Ostian buildings were not plastered; whether the structures were plastered or not depended upon the taste of the owners. We can conclude, then, i) that each of the archi- tectural and decorative features may be divided into several well-defined, common categories, and 2) that all of these features were used on all Ostian building types, baths, horrea, apartment houses, or temples, ir- respective of the actual purpose for which the struc- tures were intended. The employment of a particular architectural or decorative feature on a given building depended on the taste and wealth of the builder and not on the use to which his structure was to be put. THE EGYPTIAN COLLECTION IN THE CRANBROOK ACADEMY GALLERIES: William Peck, Detroit In- stitute of Arts. The Cranbrook Academy of Art had its beginning in 1927 under the leadership of Mr. and Mrs. George G. Booth. The collections of the important art objects assembled by the Booths have formed the nucleus of a little-known but outstanding institutional art museum. The Egyptian collection is of particular interest in that it contains several works of art that have had little or no publication, and as a consequence are virtually unknown. EXCAVATIONS IN THE PROVINCE OF SIENA, 1964: Kyle Meredith Phillips, Jr., Bryn Mawr College. During the summer of 1964 The Etruscan Founda- tion of Detroit sponsored excavations at three late Etruscan cemeteries located at Podere Papena and Poggio Luco (Maligmano) which lie to the west of Siena near the road (Senese-Aretina) leading from Siena to the Maremma. At Papena two small tomb sites were explored: the first, consisting of cremation urns buried with pottery offerings, is on the same hill as the buildings of the Podere, while the second, three rock-cut chamber tombs, is located about Iooo meters to the northwest on a second hill. Both necropoleis, located and tentatively dated to the IV-III century B.c. on ceramic evidence, are primarily of topographical importance, since they indicate occupation in an area of the Province of Siena which has virtually no ex- cavated ancient remains. The third necropolis, Poggio Luco, within the medieval Diocesis of Siena, was originally probably part of the territory of ancient Volterra and, later, of the Roman colony of Siena. Eighteen burials of two general types were cleared. Of these twelve are rock-cut tombs with recognizable dromoi and either circular or rectangular chambers. The more important examples, resembling tombs at San Gimignano and Casole d'Elsa, have benches for cremation urns. Two are exceptions. One, a monu- mental tomb still to be fully excavated, measures ap- proximately 17.50 m. from the entrance to the rear wall and has at least fifteen side chambers. The second is a miniature tomb: the dromos measures 2.60 m. in length, the chamber is 0.86 m. by 0.90 m., and 0.50 m. high. The remaining burials, simple pits dug into the stony soil or rock, contained one cinerary urn and from one to six accompanying pots. The number of burials in the rock-cut tombs is impossible to estimate; however, one tomb originally contained around eighty pieces of pottery.</page><page sequence="10">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 173 The necropolis at Poggio Luco was probably used during a relatively short period and might have served a large country estate. The pottery, with few excep- tions, is local. The shapes are primarily bowls, plates, jars, and crude impasto pots; however, jugs, askoi, amphorae, small cups, and fragments of late Volterran red-figured craters appear in limited numbers. These shapes, especially the bowls and plates, are influenced by Campanian pottery and some seem related to the later Arretine. Few Bronze objects were extant; how- ever, six of the rock-cut tombs contained eleven bronze coins. Ten of these are Republican and, when studied, should provide a more accurate chronology for the material at present broadly dated to the third and second centuries B.C. CYLINDER SEALS FROM THEBES; A PRELIMINARY RE- PORT: Edith Porada, Columbia University. Beginning in September, I963, Mr. N. Platon and Mrs. B. Stassinopoulou-Touleupa excavated several house plots in the center of modern Thebes previous to projected construction on these sites. In every case, Mycenaean remains were discovered, all probably be- longing to an extended palace complex. More precisely there seem to have been two complexes, an earlier and a later one; the walls of the later one, oriented differ- ently than those of the earlier palace, correspond in their orientation to the modern town of Thebes. In a narrow room of the later palace was found a treasure of objects made of lapis lazuli, agate and other precious materials, which seem to have fallen from an upper floor in their wooden boxes when a violent fire destroyed the palace. Most of the lapis lazuli objects are perforated cylindri- cal stones. There are also many agate stones in cylindri- cal shape but most of them are date-shaped beads. The agate from Thebes has more intense color contrasts than is generally seen in agates from Western Asia. The lapis lazuli, however, must have come through Western Asiatic trade from mines in Turkestan or Afghanistan. Thirty-nine of the lapis lazuli cylinders are engraved, but sometimes the engraving was abraded and only traces remain. In one case a new design was carved on the partly abraded cylinder, but in other cases this was not done and the craftsman's intention may have been to obtain lapis lazuli for beads or inlays. Only one agate cylinder was engraved but there were also two en- graved stamp seals, one in shape of a half-cylinder, the other a so-called flattened cylinder. The engraved lapis lazuli cylinders belong to several stylistic groups: Early Mesopotamian (Early Dynastic III to Old Babylonian, ca. 2500-I6oo00 B.c.): Kassite, made in Babylonia during the fourteenth century, or slightly earlier, in the fifteenth century; Mitannian cyl- inders from North Mesopotamia and North Syria of similar date; one Hittite cylinder, also of similar date; and several examples of Aegean styles. The agate cylinder seal belongs to the last mentioned group. In ILN, Nov. 28, 1964, Archaeological Section No. 2207, pp. 859-861, Mr. Platon's notes and the photo- graphs appear to have been badly confused by the editor of the section. Fig. 7 is a cylinder of Mitannian style with the later additions of an Egyptianized per- sonage at the end of the scene. Fig. 8 is also Mitan- nian, and both probably come from North Syria. Fig. 9 with elements of Mitannian style closely resembles the enthroned figure of a cylinder from Ras Shamara Ugarit, published by C. F. A. Schaeffer in Ugaritica II (1949) 41. Fig. 8 is not a Hittite cylinder of lapis lazuli but the agate cylinder showing a master of ani- mals, resembling the rendering on a seal ring from Mycenae, and possibly of local Theban origin. NEW EPIGRAPHICAL TECHNIQUES AND IG 12, 304 B: W. Kendrick Pritchett, University of California at Berkeley. Two techniques used by structural petrologists made it possible to make new readings in one of our most important fifth century financial documents. The potentialities of these techniques for further re- search will be pointed out. EXCAVATIONS AT KENCHREAI, 1964: Edwin S. Ram- age, Indiana University. The second campaign at Kenchreai, carried out for the American School of Classical Studies by the Uni- versity of Chicago and Indiana University, began on June 28 and extended through August 21. Excavation was continued at the north and south extremities of the harbor and new investigations were begun in the water, on a hill slightly north of center of the harbor, and at a series of remains on the coast some 800 m. north of the harbor. On the north promontory the Roman building dis- covered last year was cleared, and revealed in its more impressive period (perhaps the late first or early second century after Christ) a fine peristyle hall with extensive mosaic floors. At least one period of reconstruction and a final destruction in the fifth or sixth century after Christ are evident in the remains. On the south promontory the baptistry of the church building and other additions to the building came to light. Probes in the building confirmed a date for the church early in the fourth century after Christ. In the shallow water just off this promontory, foundation and small finds suggest the sanctuary of Isis mentioned by Pausanias and Apuleius. Extensive underwater investigation of the south mole revealed that it is composed mainly of massive broken rock reaching a height of some 30 m. at its outer ex- tremity. On the surface of the mole and the pier ex- tending back from it there was found masonry of a number of structures in conjunction with paved sur- faces. Pottery from this south mole suggests a date in the second century after Christ. On the hill Greek remains came to light. These con- sist of a large, unidentified building, a fuller's estab-</page><page sequence="11">174 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 69 lishment, and a deep rock-cut cistern, all of which are earlier than 300 B.c. From a still earlier time comes the quarry farther back on the hill. The remains up the coast were found to be the foundation and parts of the superstructure and sculp- tured members of a monument some 10.25 m. square. As yet unidentified, the monument is Roman and ap- pears to be of two periods. Small finds include quantities of glass, many lamps and lamp fragments, as well as some 510 Greek, Ro- man and Byzantine coins. Perhaps the most striking small finds are the terracottas, which when added to those of last year give us a collection extending in date from classical Greek times through the third cen- tury after Christ. THE PEACE POLICY OF PERIKLES: A. E. Raubitschek, Stanford University. The events examined in this paper, the death of Ki- mon, the Peace of Kallias, the Congress Decree of Perikles (part of which may be IG 12 26 : SEG 16.2), all took place before the transfer of the League Treas- ury from Delos to Athens in 455/4 B.c. At that time, the war alliance directed against Persia was changed into an organization for peace and security; it consisted of cities which were attached to Athens by (sometimes fictitious) bonds of kinship; an Attic Amphictyony. In this way, the conditions were created for the rise of Periklean Athens. THE POTTER MENAIDAS: I. K. Raubitschek, San Francisco State College. To the three aryballoi of Protocorinthian type in Paris (Hoppin, BF 22) and Bonn (AA 1936, 400-401, fig. 56) should be added an alabastron also of Proto- corinthian shape, now in Heidelberg, with almost identical inscription XAPOPI EMEOlIFESE ME- NAIAA S/FOPFIAS TO'OAON i. The vases are all unusual, being without handles, without feet, with rounded lip, having simple band decoration and in- scriptions engraved in the clay before firing. The cult of (Herakles) Charope is attested for Boeotia by Pau- sanias (9.24-5) and by Inscriptions (Pappadaki, Arch.- Delt. 2 [1916] 217-272; Peek, Zeitschr.f.Kirchengesch. [1940] 27-29), and the vases have been generally ac- cepted as Boeotian (Jeffery, Local Scripts 92). The other signatures on early Boeotian vases include two painted ones of Mnasalkes on ring aryballoi in Athens (Nicole, Cat. des Vases Peints du Mus. Nat. d'- Athenes i48, plate Iv) and in Boston (Fairbanks, Cat. Boston Mus. of Fine Arts 184, no. 538, plate LI), which belongs to the middle of the sixth century (Ure, Hesperia 15 [I946] 49); a painted signature of Phitha- das (or Iphithadas) on a gourd-like aryballos formerly in the Tyskiewicz collection (Pollack, RM 12 [1897] o105-I107); two of Gamedes, one painted on an unusual oenochoe in the Louvre (de Witte, BCH 2 [1878] 129, fig. 94), the other incised (not painted) on a probably spurious Protocorinthian aryballos in London (Murray, British Mus., Cat. of Vases I, Part 2, 7); one of Gryton inscribed on the sole of a plastic foot-aryballos in Bos- ton (Fairbanks, op.cit. 183-184, no. 536, plate LI), if genuine also of the sixth century. Thus, only the Me- naidas vases would belong to the seventh century. The other signatures of the seventh century are all painted and occur on vases with rather elaborate deco- ration; see the list in Shefton's note on the Aristonothos krater, Arias-Hirmer, History of Greek Vase Painting 275. If the Menaidas vases are genuine, they would be unique in their profile and in the engraved character of their inscriptions; equally unique would be the dedicatory formula (first to Charops and then to Apol- lo). ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FOR A PREHISTORIC LINK BE- TWEEN THE MEASURING SYSTEMS OF SUMERIA AND THE INDUS VALLEY: Dr. Erwin Reifler, University of Washington. Excavations in the Indus Valley have in recent dec- ades brought to light a considerable number of cubic weights of a weight standard and several specimens of a linear standard. In a paper read before the American Oriental Society in 1959, we have already submitted some evidence for an extraordinary metrological agree- ment between the weight standards of Sumeria and the Indus Valley. Our present paper will submit addi- tional evidence suggesting a link between both metrolo- gies unlikely to be coincidental. We shall first clarify the hitherto unknown metro- logical relationship between two Indus length meas- ures and between the linear and the weight standards of that civilization, and then show the close metro- logical relationship between footrule of the Sumerian governor Gudea of about 2175 B.C. and the linear sys- tem of the Indus Valley. Next we shall demonstrate that the oldest extant Su- merian metrological implements, those known as Du- du's Mina and Entemena's Vase and both of about 2400 B.c., agree rather with the metrology of the In- dus Valley than with that of Mesopotamia, and we shall show that the ancient metrological technicians who made them not only intended, but actually suc- ceeded in, much greater precision than they are usu- ally credited with. Our paper will also submit the evidence showing that the measuring system of the Indus Valley by no means perished with its civilization, but continued in India and elsewhere right into modern times. LYDIAN LEVELS BESIDE THE PACTOLUS AT SARDIS: Noel Robertson, Cornell University. This season's excavation on the bank of the Pacto- lus river, at the W edge of ancient Sardis, uncovered the most extensive remains so far of the pre-Roman city. In a few places undisturbed by later occupation, the Lydian walls are remarkably well preserved, at</page><page sequence="12">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 175 one point to the full height of the original stonework. It has been possible to reconstruct a fairly coherent plan of the site from the sixth to the third century B.c., over an area about 60 m. E-W by 30 m. N-S. The remains are mostly of houses, along with hearths, ovens, bins and other domestic installations. Five phases of building history are clearly distin- guishable throughout; but only vague and tentative dates can be suggested for these phases. The first two phases, shorter than the others, and lasting perhaps from sometime in the first half of the sixth century down to the beginning of the fifth, both ended in thor- ough destruction by fire, and were both followed by a short term of abandonment. In the third phase, last- ing through the next century, the earlier buildings were partially re-used, but occupation, though continuous, was sparse. Throughout the first three phases the houses were protected by a double line of retaining walls along the Pactolus scarp. In the fourth phase- roughly the fourth century-the settlement was con- siderably retrenched, and a new and more elaborate system of retaining walls and drains was constructed. During the fifth phase, reaching to the end of the third century or a little later, the whole area was vacant, ex- cept for a well and some outdoor walls; after this, oc- cupation ceased altogether. The excavation has thus supplied valuable evidence for the layout and construction of the Lydian city, and also produced quantities of well-stratified Lydian pottery, besides some fine Attic and East Greek pieces. EXCAVATIONS AT CORINTH, 1962-1964: Henry S. Robinson, American School of Classical Studies. Excavations during the past three years have been carried out in several areas, of which three will be noted here. A. An elaborate house attached to the northwest corner of the peribolus of temple "E." This was constructed in the first half of the ist century after Christ and lies adjacent to an important north-south road of early Roman date. The two rooms, in view of their lavish ornamentation and large size, must be associated in some way with the priestly activities of the (probably imperial) cult of temple "E." B. A Ro- man house in the area known as Anaploga. It was constructed in the first half of the Ist century after Christ and was elaborately remodeled in the later part of that century. A banqueting room, an acrolithic statue of Athena, and fragments of a building inscrip- tion all point to a structure of at least semi-public char- acter; a merchant's club or even the residence of the Proconsul Achaiae? C. An elaborate underground wa- ter system in the Anaploga area. The supply tunnel of the fourth century B.c. is more than 600 m. long and is served by over ten manholes. It fed at least two cisterns and provided water for irrigation. In the debris which choked the manholes we found fragments of Doric and Ionic architecture of large scale, boundary stones and what may be very unusual grave stelai of symbolic type, including one aniconic female head. Burials of classical date occurred nearby. RECENTLY DISCOVERED EARLY CHINESE PAINTED TOMBS: Richard C. Rudolph, University of Cali- fornia. An almost feverish archaeological activity on the Chinese mainland during the past ten or twelve years has resulted in the uncovering of a tremendous amount of material. Many new and important finds have been made, and not the least interesting and important are a number of painted tombs ranging in date from about the first to the thirteenth centuries A.D. Only several painted tombs were known before the communist take- over of China, and these were in peripheral areas. But these recent discoveries in China proper significantly enrich the meager sources of early Chinese painting and are especially important for the Han dynasty (25- 220) because formerly original paintings from this pe- riod were almost nonexistent. These murals are im- portant and unquestionably genuine documents for the history of Chinese art and mural painting in general; but perhaps more important is the content of these paintings-new information on various aspects of daily life and material culture which cannot always be found in Chinese literary sources, and new pictorial evidence of cultural influence from Central Asia and the Near East. A few of the murals are in a crude type of folk art, most of them are of fair quality, and a few are excellently painted in a very sophisticated style. Four painted tombs from the T'ang dynasty (618-906) reveal a hitherto unknown and peculiar type of tomb archi- tecture. Several tombs will be discussed in detail, in- cluding those of a minor Han official, and of a T'ang princess who was murdered at the age of seventeen and given a royal burial. SOME MAJOR GREEK SITES FROM THE AIR: Raymond V. Schoder, S.J., Loyola University. By special arrangements with the Royal Greek Air Force and the United Nations, I have been able to take color slides from the air of many archaeological sites throughout Greece. By use of telescopic and wide-angle lens, it was possible to photograph with clarity and sharpness of detail both over-all views of whole sites and their context, and particular objects of special in- terest within the complex of remains. The advantage of such photographs is perspective on inter-relations of buildings not possible from earthbound viewpoints. For this occasion air views of the following sites are presented; Mycenae acropolis, Tiryns acropolis, Epi- daurus sanctuary in general and detail of the theater, Sounium temple site, Piraeus harbors in single view, Aigosthena fortifications, Marathon plain and mound, Thermopylae pass, Salamis NE strait, Aulis bays and excavations, Aphaia temple on Aegina, Olynthus, Xerxes' Canal on Athos promontory, Mt. Olympus from east, Delphi Apollo sanctuary, Athens over-all of Agora, Acropolis, Olympieion, Stadium, and details of Acropolis and Agora.</page><page sequence="13">176 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AlA 69 DORIANS ON THE ACROPOLIS?: Evelyn Lord Smith- son, State University of New York. Fourteen graves and traces of others were found within the Mycenaean circuit wall on the Acropolis at Athens. All are carefully-built cist graves and may be assigned to the Submycenaean period, ca. I150o-100 B.c. Vincent Desborough has recently suggested a northern origin both for this grave type and for other features that are new and universally accepted at Athens at the beginning of the Submycenaean period. This is supported by skeletal material and recent dialect studies which have isolated peculiarly Dorian forms in Attic-Ionic that can only have entered before the Ionian migrations. Taken as a whole, the archaeo- logical evidence strongly suggests a new and persuasive element in the population of Athens, whose influence penetrated even the Acropolis, the very heart of the city. Yet nowhere are there indications that the Acropo- lis was sacked or taken by force. The elaborate provi- sions against siege attest an imminent threat and tradi- tion reports successful skirmishes with northerners, among them Dorians, on the western borders of Attica during the second and third generations after the Tro- jan War. Still another tradition, known to the fifth century and most fully elaborated by later authors, may have an element of truth behind it, if the associa- tion of the new burial customs with northerners holds. Besides refugees from the crumbling Mycenaean world, the Herakleidai, Argives who had taken up with Dori- ans, enjoyed on several occasions Attic, perhaps even Athenian hospitality. Despite chronological difficulties and conflicting versions of the stories, there may be some genuinely remembered tradition of foreigners, perhaps remnants of a larger band, on Attic soil. These were received and hospitality extended, though per- haps under compulsion, and some of their new ways taken over. Whoever set down these unique though not secretive graves on the Acropolis, if not the new- comers themselves, had thoroughly adopted their ritual. Even so, Thucydides may be right in saying that the same people had always inhabited Athens. For possibly more remarkable than their alleged purity of race was the ability of the Athenians to absorb, and even suppose that they had welcomed, newcomers to their land. EROS AND THE MARATHON BOY: Elmer J. Suhr, Uni- versity of Rochester. Few authorities will question the connection of Eros with the sun, but no one would assert that he stood for the sun itself. If he was an emanation of the sun, his aniconic image must have carried some resemblance to the sharp rays of Helios or the rounded projections of the rosette, the first perhaps related to the bow and arrow and the latter to the alabastron; these two ob- jects are the most common attributes of Eros. No de- scription of the unwrought stone of Thespiae, men- tioned by Pausanias, has come down to us, but passages in literature as well as artifacts refer us to two types of objects, associated with sky divinities, which seem to illustrate the meteorite and comet as prototypes of the pointed arrow and the alabastron. Popular belief in ancient times held that both meteorite and comet is- sued from the whirling sun. The Marathon Boy conforms to no known type of spinner, and though I agree with Professor Carpenter that Eros could be a spinner, this does not include the bronze in Athens. The outstretched left hand held an alabastrotheke, a container for alabastra, all of which is confirmed by a hydria in Reggio where Eros is pre- sented with the same motive and attribute. NEAR EASTERN, AEGEAN AND EUROPEAN CHRONOL- OGY: Homer L. Thomas, University of Missouri. The controversy over Egyptian and Mesopotamian chronology, which has gone on since 1939, is still far from resolved by Orientalists. Reconsideration of the present state of this controversy, or rather these contro- versies, is important for the absolute chronology of prehistoric Aegean and European cultures. The dating of the first dynasty and the Old Kingdom is important for fixing the chronology of Early Minoan and Early Helladic cultures and the later Neolithic cultures of Europe. There are two main schools of thought: one proposes a higher date for the beginning of the first dynasty, 31st century B.c., while the other puts its be- ginning as late as the end of the 29th century B.c. Egyp- tologists thus provide a range of about 300 years for estimating the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in the Aegean. The more uncertain Mesopotamian chro- nology is only of indirect usefulness for this purpose. Although Old Kingdom dates, which are significant for fixing EM II, are more settled, variations in present chronological schemes are sufficient to allow room for convincing arguments by those seeking either a high or a low chronology in the Aegean and Europe. While there is general agreement about the chronology of the Middle Kingdom, there is much dispute concerning the absolute dates of the reigns of the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties. These uncertainties, together with the equally significant disagreements over Mesopotamian chronol- ogy and pertinent historical synchronisms between Egypt and southwest Asia, raise many questions for both Mycenaean and European chronology. It may well be that the issues between the Oriental- ists and Egyptologists cannot be resolved at present. In view of these uncertainties, Aegean and European archaeologists must be mindful of the range of choice and the pitfalls of Near Eastern chronology when pro- jecting Aegean and European dates on the basis of Near Eastern connections. In light of the recent revolu- tion in chronology brought to so many periods by Car- bon-i4 dating, all absolute dates determined by Near Eastern historical dates must be treated with reserva- tion. Our Aegean and European chronologies will al- ways be estimates, which must now be based upon radiocarbon determinations as well as Near Eastern his- torical dates.</page><page sequence="14">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 177 FAIENCE PORTRAITS OF PTOLEMAIC KINGS: Dorothy B. Thompson, Institute for Advanced Study. Less well known than the faience portraits of Ptole- maic queens, especially those on oinochoai, are a few similar pieces that represent the kings. Of the ten presented here several have already been published; others are unknown. They should be studied as a group in relation to the problems of Ptolemaic iconog- raphy. The best examples are delicately modeled and can readily be recognized as true portraits. In the absence of inscriptions, however, several can be identified only with difficulty. Using as a basis all available portraits in other media, we can trace a series from roughly 270 until about 150 B.c. This series includes heads that were presumably emblemata from the floors of bowls as well as relief figures from the walls of vases. It is possible that these modest portraits will aid us in the complicated problems of Ptolemaic iconography. THE SANCTUARY OF THESEUS IN ATHENS: Homer A. Thompson, The Institute for Advanced Study. Investigations carried out in the summer of 1964 in the so-called South Square at the south side of the Athenian Agora have necessitated the reconsideration of the names and purpose of a number of buildings in that area. (For the earlier interpretation see The Athenian Agora: A Guide, 1962.) It is now apparent that the South Square is a crea- tion of the second and third quarter of the second century B.c. Within this period the middle Stoa and East Building were erected de novo; the South Stoa was completely rebuilt; the great rectangular enclosure previously identified as the Heliaia received a peristyle court, and the old Southwest Fountain House was radically altered. The area bounded by these struc- tures was henceforth entered through the East Build- ing. The East Building is now known to have contained an apodyterion, a loutron (with shower bath, wash- basins and footbasin), and exhedrai; all characteristic elements of a Hellenistic gymnasium. The Middle and South Stoas would have provided admirable covered running tracks; the "Heliaia" as remodeled has the plan of a typical palaestra and the Southwest Fountain House in its altered state may well have been used as a swimming pool. Pausanias, immediately after his account of the Agora proper, mentioned a gymnasium which was "not far from the Agora" and which was named from its founder "the Ptolemaion." Of the various Ptolemies the most likely appears to be the 6th, Ptolemy Philome- tor. His dates (185-146 B.c.) are thoroughly appropri- ate, and it may be significant that the outer colonnade of the Middle Stoa was closed in part by a screen wall of Ptolemaic type. "Close to the Gymnasium" continued Pausanias, "is a sanctuary of Theseus." The principal building of the sanctuary, named Sekos by Pausanias, may now be recognized in the large rectangular structure previ- ously identified as the Heliaia. The date of the struc- ture is suitable to the occasion when the bones of Theseus were brought from Skyros to Athens (ca. 475 B.C.). Its original design is strikingly similar to the heroon of Gjolbaschi-Trysa in Lycia, which clearly owes much to Athenian influence. After the modifica- tions carried out in the second century B.c., the plan is that typical of Hellenistic heroa, and best represented at Kalydon. In this period heroa not uncommonly served the functions of the Palaestra, and such a com- bination of uses would be particularly appropriate to an heroon of Theseus, the reputed inventor of wrestling. Prominent in the festival of Theseus at Athens were the ritual meals open to all the citizens. Admirable provision for these meals may now be recognized in the long row of dining rooms at the back of South Stoa I, the large building that closed the south side of the South Square from the late fifth century B.C. until its replacement by South Stoa II. There is reason to believe that a sanctuary of Theseus had existed in this region as early at least as the first half of the sixth century B.C. The area of the temenos was extensive from the beginning, its limits correspond- ing closely, in fact, with those of the South Square as laid out in the second century B.C. The enclosure was therefore amply large for the assembly of citizens called by Peisistratos, for the bivouac of the Athenians on the anxious night after the mutilation of the Herms, as well as for the occasional meeting of the Boule and of lawcourts, and for the allotment to certain magistracies, all of which uses are attested by the literary evidence. The position here proposed for the Theseion cor- responds with Plutarch's statement that the sanctuary lay in the middle of the city. The extent of the estab- lishment here considered, its antiquity and the beauty of its buildings also make credible Plutarch's observa- tion that all men revered the Theseion as they did the Parthenon and the Eleusinion.

Weinberg, University of Missouri. Two Roman glass factories in Western Galilee were investigated during the past summer by a joint ex- pedition of the Corning Museum of Glass and the Museum of Art and Archaeology of the University of Missouri. The main site, excavated during six weeks, was on the hill of Jelemie, a spur of Mount Carmel toward its southeastern end. An extensive building complex was exposed, in the lowest level of which were installations for glass manufacture. Walls and floors showed evidence of intense heat. Glass fragments were everywhere and included large numbers from vessels as well as much waste. Down the slope discarded ref-</page><page sequence="15">178 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AIA 69 use was found, including pieces of dismantled fur- naces. When the glass factory went out of use, domestic buildings were built over them. These produced quanti- ties of pottery, lamps, and coins. All the evidence points to a limited occupation of less than a century; the identified coins suggest that this was during the second half of the fourth century of our era. Jelemie has thus yielded, for the first time, a large amount of closely dated glass, the study of which should estab- lish the types of glass vessels manufactured in this region in the fourth century. A test excavation of eight days was made at one of several sites near the village of Kafr Yasif, east of Acre; a field which showed the greatest concentra- tion of glass on the surface was chosen for the test. The two trenches dug show that there was here a large dump from a glass factory; the factory itself was not located. Great piles of debris were com- prised largely of pieces of dismantled furnaces, both bricks from the lower part and walls with glass ad- hering to them. There were also numerous fragments of vessels and much waste glass, as well as raw ma- terials. Again, a domestic establishment seems to have followed the glass factory and much pottery was later dumped at the same site. The date of this site is ap- parently fifth and early sixth centuries. Reconnaissance has revealed numerous sites of glass manufacture in Western Galilee. It is planned to widen the scope of the excavations to include several of these, with the ultimate aim of being able to identify the products of one of the most noted areas of glass manufacture in the Roman world. THE HERA TEMPLE. AT OLYMPIA: SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING ITS WOODEN CONSTRUCTION: Donald White, University of Michigan. Since D6rpfeld's initial publication of the Hera Temple at Olympia, people have been content to ac- cept the fact that the temple originally employed wood in large portions of its construction. In the first place, the entire entablature is said to have been made from wood. However, I shall argue that the reasons put forth for this conjecture do not seem entirely secure. Quite apart from that, there is the matter of the original wooden peripteros. D6rpfeld's explanation for the variations in the surviving stone colonnade was that as the wooden columns gradually rotted away they were replaced in stone. In recent years this theory has lost favor, and Dinsmoor and Robertson have substituted the idea that each column was provided as a gift-offering of a city or pious individual. While this explanation avoids the problem of how one column can rot away in less than fifty years while others can survive down to Roman times, it suffers from the fact that such a practice would seem to be an anomaly: one cannot readily parallel the offering of the repair of single columns from a temple colonnade with vo- tive gifts from other sites. In addition to the question of why the columns were replaced there is the problem of the extraordinary amount of variation in the columns and capitals and in their placement. I shall argue that these differences in style, structure and size are more far-reaching than has hitherto been appreciated, and that furthermore these differences are especially peculiar in light of the very careful repairs carried out on the near-by Zeus Temple in the second century. Also, I will raise the problem of why the columns seem to be aligned on the south flank, but not on the north. Finally I will discuss the possible implications of the fact that one column from the south flank and one column from the north have very similar early archaic echinus profiles, and yet differ startlingly in respect to size and construction. I shall provide no answers in the course of this pa- per, but merely hope to stimulate a re-discussion of this familiar monument through the posing of the fol- lowing questions: I) Is it really necessary to believe that the entablature was wood? 2) Now that Doirp- feld's theory that the rotting-out of the wood members caused their gradual replacement, can we accept Dins- moor's and Robertson's idea that the replacement came about through the dedication of single columns over the centuries by cities or individuals? 3) If this last theory is also unsatisfactory, what does account for the extraordinary variety in the surviving columns and capitals? 4) Why were not the sensitivities of those responsible for the repairs disturbed by the very varia- tions that are so carefully avoided in the case of the Zeus Temple, and secondly by the haphazard and un- systematic way in which they were carried out? 5) What is the explanation for the peculiar difference be- tween the two early archaic columns? 6) And finally, does the answer to all these questions actually have to do with some calculated policy toward the temple put into effect over an interval of six centuries, as all commentators seem to suppose, or does it lie elsewhere? NEMEA, 1964: Charles K. Williams, American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The American School of Classical Studies conducted a three month campaign at ancient Nemea during the spring of 1964. The work consisted of the clearing of the eastern end of a large, late fourth-century building that had been partially built over by the Christian basilica, the recovery of the complete plan of the early Christian baptistery that lies directly north of the ba- silica, and the examination of a rectangular building that lies between the temple of Zeus and the basilica. Two main points emerged from the investigations. The southern limit of the sanctuary appears to have been formed by a row of three buildings, possibly more, that lie close together at about 35 m. south of the tem- ple. These structures face the temple and appear to define the temenos at this point. Farther south, behind these buildings, and under a long, late fourth-century building there was uncovered a kiln and part of the kiln yard. The firing chamber of the kiln is well pre- served except for the area where the later founda-</page><page sequence="16">1965] SIXTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 179 tions of the long building cut through the kiln walls. The plan of the long building, built at the end of the fourth century, produced the second fact hitherto unanticipated. The building appears to have been made of five separate units, each with its own entrance from the road that runs along the south wall of the struc- ture. The building is largely built of re-used material and of poor construction, but possibly served as the prytaneion for the Nemean Games during the early part of the third century. AN INSCRIBED HELMET IN BALTIMORE: J. H. Young, Johns Hopkins University. A bronze helmet was recently added to the archaeo- logical collection of the Johns Hopkins University. It is one of a group of antiquities collected in the Medi- terranean by Mr. Kemper Simpson of Washington, and generously given to the University of which he was an alumnus. The helmet purports to come from Olympia, and was tentatively dated to the fourth century before Christ. Our helmet is 22 cm. high, and is intact except for minor tears in the bronze. The nose-guard is broken at the bridge and repaired (in antiquity ?) with an oblong piece of bronze soldered on behind; similar patches were also used to reinforce the outer corner of each eye, although there are no breaks there. In shape it belongs to the Corinthian group of hel- mets; the top is a skullcap, the lower back a neckpiece, set off at either side by a notch from the cheekpieces closing the sides. The lower edge of our neckpiece is curved up and out. The eye-holes are cut out sharply, leaving between them a narrow somewhat pointed nose-guard. Close to the edge, all around, a row of holes has been punched out, about i cm. apart; around the bot- tom corners of the cheekpieces the row is intermedi- ately doubled. The holes may have served to fasten in a lining, but it is more likely that each hole held a decorative silver stud. Along the back one can see scratches around them where something has been pried out. There was no other decoration. Helmets like this one have been well discussed by Kukahn (Der Griechische Helm, diss. Marburg, 1936) and more recently by Kunze (Olympiabericht VII [I96i] 56ff). Our example appears to belong to the latter's early archaic "Myros Group," and is probably to be dated around 600 B.c. Many of these helmets ended their active careers as dedications at Olympia; thus the provenience reported may well be correct. Inside our helmet, along the lower edge of the right cheekpiece, is inscribed a man's name: KRATAIME- NES. The strokes are thin and shallow, hence easily and previously overlooked, and impossible to photo- graph; although in the nominative, the name must, I believe, denote the owner. The inscription is retro- grade, the forms of the letters highly archaic. They are elongated and narrow (e.g. the nu is 3 cm. high and I.I cm. wide). Here are the main characteristics: alpha tips, with a slanting crossbar; E serves for epsilon and eta and has sharply slanting crossbars and tail be- low; iota is broken, into at least four short strokes; kappa has short slanting diagonals to the vertical stroke; mu and nu have the first stroke very long, the others short, high and slanting; rho's semicircle is pointed; tau is very tall and the cross-stroke narrow; while the final S is represented by san. The helmet may have been made in Corinth and dedicated at Olympia but the letter-forms indicate that Kpawratp.xvr came from neither place. With the help of Miss Jeffrey's monumental study (The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece, Oxford I96I) we can, I believe, track Krataimenes back to Achaea, or to one of the areas influenced by Achaean alphabetic usage, for example Ithaca. Hence we might trace the travels of this helmet; from its manufacture in Corinth, to its owner in Achaea (or perhaps Ithaca), to its dedication at Olym- pia, to the antiquities market, and, finally, to Baltimore. ON THE CONTINUITY OF CERTAIN PATTERNS IN NORTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICA: Jerzy Zaborski, Arizona State University. New archaeological researches along the St. Law- rence river and in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces demonstrate a culture discontinuity between the Point Peninsula horizon and an earlier Laurentian culture in Ontario, while disclosing culture continuity in the Mari- times. The latter region manifests foci of the coastal Aspect of the Woodland Pattern, enriched by Owasco-Iro- quoian ceramic tradition and agriculture, and the Beothukan Focus carrying old Laurentian culture, in an unmixed manner. The Woodland Pattern shows a continuity to the culture of the Algonkians of contemporary times, while the point Peninsula-an intrusive culture in the North- east-itself a peripheral focus of the Hopewellian Pat- tern, shows its transformation into the Owasco Aspect. The Iroquoian Phase of modern history evolved from the latter.</page></plain_text>
