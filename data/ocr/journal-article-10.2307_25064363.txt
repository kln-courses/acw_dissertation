This article compares how Americans and Japanese classify causes of death, the timing and place of dying, and questions of pain and burden. Although people in both coun tries define a good death in broadly similar ways, their metaphors are derived from culturally constructed views of "nature" and of what it means to be human. Such notions do not determine how people actually die, but are the lens through which people interpret their own dying and that of others. In Japanese studies, we have accounts of Buddhist ideas about death from scholars of religion. We have studies of mortuary ritual and descriptions of funerals and memorial services in ethnographic accounts of village and city life. We have studies of birthing and babies, school children, teenagers, workers, mothers, and, increasingly, the elderly. It would seem that we have the life course covered, from birth to death. Yet what do we know about dy ing? To the extent that we think of death as a biological event, dying seems to negate culture, but even that act of defining death affirms the embedded My research in the American hospital was supported by a Grauel Faculty Fellowship of John Carroll University. Research in Japan was supported by an Abe Fellowship. I am grateful to these programs for affording me the opportunity to pursue this research and to the many people in both countries who shared their ideas, experiences, and expertise with me. In partic ular, I owe a tremendous debt to the patients and families who, already coping with the stresses of illness and hospitalization, were willing to allow me to enter their lives. All names in this ar ticle are pseudonyms. I am also grateful for helpful feedback on earlier versions of this essay from several anonymous reviewers, John Traphagan, Michael Fetters, Paul Nietupski, and par ticipants in an early discussion of this research in the Fall 1997 Lecture Series at the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies. 33 Journal of Japanese Studies, 29:1 ? 2003 Society for Japanese Studies</page><page sequence="2">34 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) ness of dying in social life. Dying appears to physically sever the individual from the world as we know it and yet it binds the living to the dead with the impact of its liminality. As an American anthropologist of Japan, I became intrigued with the question of what an academic study of dying might reveal about Japanese culture. However, as I thought about the issue, I recognized that I understood little of dying as a life stage in my own country. Because of that, it seemed that the implicit comparison that would result from studying only Japan would be intellectually dangerous,1 so I determined that I would conduct field work in both countries. Thus over the past decade, I have been intrud ing into the lives of seriously ill patients, their families, and their caregivers in both the United States and Japan to learn more about the decisions that are made about the use of high-tech medicine at the end of life. Japan and the United States share similar biom?dical technologies and approaches but reflect historically different worldviews and experiences of industrialization. In both postindustrial societies, death most likely occurs in old age from degenerative diseases such as cancers, strokes, and heart dis ease. Moreover, dying is medicalized, that is, defined as an objective, bio logical process that requires the dying person be removed from his or her everyday life and placed under the supervision of medical professionals.2 In fact, approximately 77 per cent of deaths in both the United States and Ja pan occur in health care institutions.3 To understand the process of dying in postindustrial societies, we must look at the various ways dying can occur, but also recognize that these postindustrial diseases and treatments take place within a cultural context that offers a range of meanings from which people interpret their experiences. A fuller explanation of end-of-life decisions must consider the numer ous influences on how people live as they approach death within each soci ety, including their financial situations, their personalities, the institutional structures in which they receive treatment and care, their interpersonal rela 1. That is, in the terminology I employ in this essay, without research-based knowledge of the United States, I would be dependent for my understanding of Japanese decisions on American cultural scripts of which I might be only vaguely conscious. These needed to be made explicit by conducting research in an American medical setting as though it were a for eign culture, which indeed it often was. 2. See Ivan Illich, Limits to Medicine; Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976) and Philippe Aries, Western Attitudes toward Death, trans. Patricia M. Ranum (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974). 3. In Japan, 76.8 per cent of deaths occurred in hospitals or in nursing homes in 1994 (K?seish? Daijin Kanb? T?kei J?h?bu, Jink? d?tai t?kei, Heisei rokunen, Vol. 1 [Tokyo: K?seish?, 1996], p. 127); in the United States, the figure was 77.0 per cent in 1992 (U.S. De partment of Health and Human Services, Vital Statistics, 1992, Vol. 2 [Hyattsville, Md.: DHHS, 1996], p. 374).</page><page sequence="3">Long: The Good Death 35 tions, and social hierarchies.4 This article focuses more narrowly on the ideas about dying that color people's experiences and thus come to consti tute the cultural meanings by which dying is evaluated. In both countries, there are widely shared ideas about the good death as well as multiple dis courses and interpretations about the relative merits of dying through vari ous causes, timing, manner, and places. This essay, then, is a study of mul tiple ideas of a good death in both societies. Ideas about good and bad deaths can be examined at several levels. One is what British sociologist Clive Seale discusses as "cultural scripts" of dy ing.5 By this he means cultural representations of death that are available to individuals in late mo dernity. ... These can, alternatively, be described as discourses on death or cultural scripts, making available a variety of meta-stories to dying and be reaved people for the interpretation of their biographical situations, (p. 4, emphasis added) These are incorporated into subtle messages in popular culture and every day socialization, but more obviously take the form of explicit statements by educators, religious leaders, medical professionals, journalists, and oth ers who contribute to, explicate, and justify such narratives. These state ments represent the cultural scripts at a general, abstract level dissociated from the specific circumstances that are always present in daily life. Yet they are often the only data upon which those who study ideas about death across cultures or religious traditions base their descriptions and conclusions. This essay instead looks to the ways that such cultural scripts interface with the notions of "ordinary people" facing serious illness and possible death, their own or that of others. Like the experts discussed above, "ordi nary people" also contribute to the creation and modification of cultural scripts, but they do so through their decisions, actions, and conversations in 4. A more thorough description of end-of-life decisions in Japan is the objective of a booklength manuscript I am writing, tentatively titled "Final Days: Japanese Culture and Choice at the End of Life." It will discuss the impact of structural context, cultural meanings, and social relationships on decisions about dying more fully than is possible in an article. 5. Clive Seale, Constructing Death: The Sociology of Dying and Bereavement (Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). For contemporary Anglophone countries, Seale identifies modern medicine, revivalism, and a new antirevivalist script. He stresses that these scripts are not determinitive but rather should be considered "as raw materials that are strate gically (though not always consciously) used in particular situations. Although elements of so cial structure may influence access to such scripts [e.g., social class, gender, and age differ ences; see p. 149] this model is capable of preserving the view that not everyone responds in the same way to death, and nor do people behave in a uniform fashion in relation to mortuary rituals" (p. 68).</page><page sequence="4">36 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) a less direct manner.6 Because their uses of and contributions to cultural scripts are less conscious and less obvious, understanding them requires al ternative methods of inquiry. My research questions have been framed by American bioethical cate gories and questions about "how to die" because these are concerns that re sult from the processes of medicalization of death, the development of med ical technologies, and postindustrial institutional arrangements for dying. End-of-life issues such as euthanasia, withdrawing of treatment, and pain management that are discussed by academic bioethicists are part of the day to-day experience of medical professionals, patients, and families, and are widely discussed in the media in both countries. Much writing in cross cultural bioethics, however, relies on public rhetoric of expert opinion and opinion polls as if they are equivalent to descriptions of daily life, to the ex clusion of the experiences of ordinary people. My methods and concerns are those of a cultural anthropologist interested in these more everyday behav iors and ideas. In both countries, I observed and participated in the daily activities of hospitals and home care situations and elicited people's ideas in formal in terviews and informal discussions.7 Notions of good and bad deaths fre 6.

The American fieldwork was conducted for one month in 1992 and six months in 1993 in a large, independent, tertiary-care hospital in a midwestern city. The hospital had no religious affiliation. Time was spent observing rounds, conferences, and patient care and interviewing patients and staff in several intensive care units, regular wards, and in the departments of bioethics and palliative care. In addition, all patients or family members going through a par ticular admitting desk during the periods of research were approached about participation in the brief interviews concerning their ideas about advance directives. Informed consent was ob tained from 102 people, and 19 of these were interviewed in greater depth later in their hospi talization. Aside from the bioethicists, none of the Americans was a nationally known partici pant in the discourse on end-of-life care. Interviews at the American hospital were conducted in English. Notes were taken during and immediately after interviews or observations and field journals were kept. The Japanese data were collected over seven months in 1996 through observation and in terviews in three hospitals of different types (a private university hospital, a national specialty hospital, and the hospice and p?diatrie units of a Christian hospital) and in home visits with home nurses and/or physicians. In addition to observing rounds, family conferences, staff con ferences, and patient care situations, I obtained informed consent and conducted interviews with 41 clinical physicians, 14 nurses, 9 volunteers, 34 seriously ill patients, 23 family care givers, and 21 other professionals such as social workers, bioethicists, and medical journalists. Two of the physicians, the bioethicists, and the medical journalists were chosen because they actively contribute to the public discourse on end-of-life issues. The rest were "ordinary people" in the sense that they do not write or speak publicly as "experts" on these issues. In terviews in Japan were conducted in Japanese. As in the U.S. fieldwork, notes were taken dur ing and immediately after interviews or observations, and daily field journals were kept. When</page><page sequence="5">Long: The Good Death 37 quently came up spontaneously. Other times I asked people (usually not those who were near death) to define their own "ideal" way to die. In some of the Japanese interviews, I additionally asked people to explain Japanese terms that I had identified from reading and from other interviews as com mon phrases used to describe styles of dying. From these observational and interview data, I have inductively constructed a framework of categories that are general enough to allow comparison between the two societies but specific enough to capture and organize the richness of the images expressed.8 The title of this article, "Becoming a Cucumber," is one such image. It comes from the comments of a 74-year-old man I interviewed as he was be ing admitted to an American hospital. He explained, "I have discussed that I don't want life-prolonging machines with my family. I don't want to lie around like a cucumber. There's no pleasure for yourself, and I don't want to be a burden." His vivid metaphor for what medical workers call "persistent vegetative state" (or, more recently, "permanent unconscious state") re minds us that to understand dying, we cannot rely only on the pronounce ments of medical professionals, bioethicists, or religious leaders. Rather, dying is intimately bound up with the meaning people attribute to living, as the petty bureaucrat Watanabe in Kurosawa's film Ikiru reminds us: "I can't die just yet. I don't know what I've been living for, all these years."9 Just as we understand that cultural scripts and ideals influence but do not determine how we live, we need to recognize the gaps that may exist be tween the ideas of those who explicate "how to die" and the ways in which ordinary people interpret their own and others' experiences of serious ill appropriate the formal Japanese interviews, mainly those with medical staff, were tape recorded and later transcribed by a native speaker. The majority of interviews and observations in both countries were conducted in hospitals because that is the locale where most deaths occur, but I also participated in some home visits with nurses and physicians or to interview on my own. I do not claim that the people I met are representative of Japanese or of Americans. It is never possible to generalize from such a small sample. However, I spoke with adult men and women of a variety of age cohorts, education lev els, occupations, and socioeconomic circumstances, and I believe that the range of experiences, attitudes, and ideas they expressed are indicative of both common themes and the diversity of responses beyond my sample. 8. Because these categories are derived inductively from my field sites, I cannot claim that they would be effective for comparison of all societies. However, they do seem to be reason able elements of concern. I have not included other societies in the comparison for conceptual reasons (for example, to include the case of a country that cannot afford regular use of respira tors to prolong life would present an important issue, but one beyond the topic of this article) and for methodological reasons (I do not have the language and culturally based interpersonal skills required to interview and observe on a sensitive topic outside non-Japanese- and English speaking societies). 9.

Dying occupies a liminal space between normal social life and biological death, and thus between culture and nature (as understood culturally). That opposition is itself ambiguous and shifting, and the liminal status is thus fraught with uncertainty. As cultural scripts attempt to frame that uncertainty, they offer metaphors that allow varying interpretations not only across cultural contexts or among different individuals within the same society, but also simultaneously within each person's experience. Victor Turner suggests that symbols are particularly powerful because they allow for a common cultural "language" without fixed conclusions or standard ized meaning.10 Careful listening as ordinary people draw upon and manip ulate elements of the cultural scripts allows us to identify the common "lan guage" of human dying within and across societies, and also indicates the variations of meaning and experience between and within them. This article then contributes to an ethnology of dying by attempting to understand the various culturally specific ideas expressed by Americans and Japanese as they interpret their experiences and discuss their ideas about life and death. The "bottom up" approach offers an alternative perspective on the gaps in any society between official rhetoric and lived experience. At the same time, the comparison also allows us to see beyond the cultural metaphors and identify common elements in the images of a "good death" for humans in an era of long life expectancies and high-tech medicine. Culture, Nature, and Death in Japan and the United States In both Japan and the United States dying is, in general, recognized as a natural occurrence. Death is a foregone conclusion for all living things. But just how "natural" is defined may lead to differing interpretations of dying. The notion that European culture is opposed to "nature," that humans at tempt to control or dominate nature, is frequently contrasted with an Asian approach of acceptance of a "nature" that is inclusive of human activity.11 Nature is claimed as part of a particularly Japanese religiosity in which na ture partakes in salvation and is a means by which humans may achieve it.12 We might expect, then, that Japanese would see their own dying and that of others as a continuation of a natural process, while Americans and Euro 10.

Alternatively, Americans might associate a Japanese style of dying with the calm stoicism of the samurai who faces death with honor. Those with an interest in Buddhism have focused on the ideal of a calm acceptance of death, as Sushila Blackman does in her book Graceful Exits: How Great Beings Die,13 relating stories about deaths of famous Asian sages, monks, and priests. Scholars of religion have found similar themes in Buddhist-influenced texts.14 For example, Yoel Hoffmann, in his book Jap anese Death Poems,15 provides a nuanced analysis that points to historical change in ideas about death, notes the use of satire and parody, and intro duces the idea of intrasocietal variation. The two sections of death poems in his volume reveal a somewhat different attitude toward death by Buddhist priests and by secular writers of haiku poetry. The former often express lack of regret as an ideal and underscore the meaninglessness of life and death. The haiku poems express a stronger sense of wishing to linger in this world for a bit longer, a reflection of continuing attachments within an acceptance that death must come as part of the natural course of things. Ethnographers have supplemented these views of an ideal death as calm, peaceful, or reflective with an emphasis on its social meanings. They find a common notion of continuity in behavior and personality from living to dy ing to the other world.16 Moreover, the significance of this continuity is not only personal but also strongly interpersonal. Despite the grounding of Jap anese daily life in a scientific understanding of the world, there continues to be an assumption of continued interaction between the living and the dead. Studies of ancestral rites and memorialized fetuses, as well as public opin ion polls, indicate that most Japanese have at least a vague sense of such a "life after death" alongside their scientific worldview.17 These ideas seem to 13.

Morioka Kiyomi shows how changes in family form from lineally extended to nuclear result from broader socioeconomic change, and impact the mean ing of the relation between the living and the ancestors. Less bound to in heritance and household continuity, ancestors can be incorporated into the family in more personal ways.19 Gradual changes in burial preferences and practices also reflect changes in the form and meaning of family and gender roles, as increasingly people indicate that they prefer not to have their ashes buried in the family grave. Instead, they may wish to have their ashes scat tered over the ocean or be united in a common grave with people who are not relatives. A woman may desire burial with her husband only or with her natal family, or even in an individual grave.20 In The Price of Death, Hikaru Suzuki analyzes contemporary funerals in comparison to "traditional" mor tuary rites and finds that they have become professionalized and commer cialized.

Media coverage of the issues of contemporary dying such as cancer disclosure and brain death have also given prominent voice to alternative viewpoints, often based on or opposed to the "Western" scientific approach. Furthermore, re cent writings have challenged assumptions about Japanese views of nature, such as the harmonious integration of humans into the landscape. Tessa Morris-Suzuki recognizes that this view is an important part of Japanese tra dition but asserts that this approach to nature is neither predominant nor un changing. She traces the history of an approach well accepted in the Toku gawa period in which humans were thought to have not only a right but a duty to develop the resources of nature for their own purposes (kaibutsu, the "opening up of nature").22 In Japanese Images of Nature: Cultural Per spectives, the contributors claim that "nature" is a cultural phenomenon. Defined in a process of condensing, selecting, channeling, idealizing, and making palatable the physical environment, Japanese culture has often at tempted to control and dominate nature rather than passively accept it.23 It would seem, then, that dying as a natural process has multiple interpreta tions, both historically and in contemporary Japan. Social scientists writing about the good death in the United States, Brit ain, and Australia have also focused attention on notions of a natural death in opposition to the assumption of a biom?dical discourse on dying.24 Philippe Aries pointed to the significance of historical change in notions of the good death, recognizing that the manner of dying is a cultural phenom enon.25 Subsequently, Tony Walter has examined what he calls the revival ist discourse in which "natural death" is opposed to a medicalized death.

The ideal death takes place at home surrounded by caring relatives and friends. Common to these descriptions is the desire for control and for personal dig nity.27 Some writers caution, however, that there are multiple definitions of a good death.28 Literature critical of hospice and other "revivalist" ap proaches to dying, along with the reactions of ordinary people facing death or bereavement, constitutes an alternative model of resistance to revivalist notions of "natural death," clearly establishing the concept as historically and socially contingent.29 One alternative perspective on the good death in the "West" was offered by some of my Japanese informants.

Several people with vastly different educational levels made comments to me such as, "In Japan, we don't be lieve in the idea of heaven like Christians do, so death is much more fright ening for us." They seem to hold an image of Americans who, bluntly told that they are dying, remain unflustered, committed to fighting their disease until the end, calmly writing out living wills, and then dying in dignity, alone, in peace, knowing they will be reunited with their God in heaven. To some of the Japanese people with whom I spoke, it seems that Americans retain their honor by being stoic individuals, responsible only to God, and indeed some of the Americans I interviewed utilized this framework in de scribing good or bad dying. Although people with whom I spoke in both countries generally ac cepted that there were cultural differences in ideas about dying, they con tinued to grant some degree of validity to a concept of "natural" death, and cultural comparison rarely entered into more concrete discussions about dy ing. Since dying is cultural, it is by definition filled with unquestioned as sumptions about what is "natural." While it is useful to contrast cultural scripts of dying, examining the ways in which ordinary people talk about death and looking at decisions made about dying can lead to a deeper un derstanding of cultural differences and similarities.30 American and Japanese Criteria for a Good Death Compared Criteria for distinguishing good and bad deaths are multiple and over lapping. From my interviews, observations, and reading, some of the most important features defining the various styles of dying are: the cause of death, the time of dying relative to age and onset of symptoms, the extent of pain and suffering, the extent to which the dying is thought to create depen dency or a burden on others, and the environment in which the dying takes place, especially the absence or presence of family and very close friends.

Hoffmann notes that the character for "death" is rarely used alone in reference to individuals but rather in combination with other characters.31 Expressions such as shinju (lovers' suicide), senshi (death in war), or r?shi (death in old age) link the death to the kind of life 30. This essay focuses on ideas about dying. The interpersonal and behavioral aspects of decisions about dying are discussed in Susan Long, "Living Poorly or Dying Well: Decisions about Life Support and Treatment Termination for American and Japanese Patients," Journal of Clinical Ethics, Vol. 11, No. 3 (2000), pp. 236-50. 31. Hoffmann, Japanese Death Poems, p. 29.</page><page sequence="12">44 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) led by the person and to the circumstances of his or her death. There is even a term for a man's death that occurs during sexual intercourse with a lover. The consistent use of modifiers is almost as though human death requires some kind of explanation. It is possible, however, to discern some order to the variation. At the first level, there is a distinction between death from illness and all other deaths, such as "death from old age" (r?sui), sudden death (totsuzenshi), homicide (kosatsushi), suicide (jisatsushi), and accidental death (jikoshi). Deaths from illness are distinguished in this folk classification by the organ system affected or by the disease name, such as cancer (gari), heart disease (shinz?by?), liver disease (kanz?by?), stroke (n?ikketsu), and senility (boke32). Images of good and bad deaths overlap with these various categories of dying, creating a web that reflects society's inconsistent values about what is important in life. For example, some people told me their ideal death would be r?sui, a gradual decline leading to death in old age. Others pre ferred a sudden death such as pokkuri in which they would be healthy until just before death. People who wanted r?sui desired a painless death but did not want to die young (before their time) either, and they were willing to accept a gradual decline and increased dependency in exchange. For others who similarly desired a pain-free dying, a concern to not become a burden on family led them to select the option, in the abstract of course, of pokkuri?3 These terms and categories will be further discussed below. United States. Americans similarly label deaths by illness category and also have nonillness categories such as suicide, homicide, death from natu ral disaster, and so on. I question how strongly the categories of r?sui and pokkuri would be utilized by the people in my American sample, though certainly in the past, Americans talked about "dying in your sleep" and "death from old age," and recognized a distinction between sudden death and others. But those categories have in contemporary American culture be come unacceptable as causes of death. The medicalization of death has led to the expectation that people must die of some biological dysfunction. However, as Susan Sontag has pointed out, all diseases are not equal. In a previous era, tuberculosis and, more recently, cancer and AIDS take on great symbolic significance.34 Although some cancer patients acknowledge 32. On boke, see Traphagan, Taming Oblivion. 33. The relationship between pokkuri and not being a burden is discussed by Richard Young and Fuki Ikeuchi in "Religion in 'The Hateful Age': Reflections on Pokkuri and Other Geriatric Rituals in Japan's Aging Society," in Susanne Formanek and Sepp Linhart, eds., Ag ing: Asian Experiences Past and Present (Vienna: ?sterreichische Akademie der Wis senschaften, 1997), pp. 234-36. 34.

This perspective was clearly expressed by Mrs. Raus, a 72-year-old American woman who was referred to the hospital with a lump in her breast. She was very involved with her adult children and their families who all lived in the vicinity but had not told them about the lump because she knew they would try to talk her into having surgery. She explained that she did not want to be a burden on her family by being "old and sick." Rather, she saw her cancer as a sign from God that she had lived all of her useful life and now it was time to "step aside" for the younger generation. The cause of death for a cancer patient thus carries different meanings than for patients dying of, for example, heart disease, which is more often associated with stress and life style. One candidate for a heart transplant even suggested to the transplant team's social worker that perhaps he had been trying to kill him self with his life style, which included a history of alcohol abuse, marriage at age 15 ending in divorce, and overeating to a weight of 300 pounds. Heart disease for him was the body's logical response to his human decisions, as opposed to God's message that he had lived a full life. Time: Age In both Japan and the United States, in thinking of both death from ill ness and other deaths, people make distinctions concerning time in two senses. Age is an extremely important factor in responding to news of seri ous illness or death. The other time factor is the rapidity of death, which is the subject of the following section. Japan. Most people, both lay and professional, with whom I spoke in Ja pan could not imagine not doing everything possible to save the life of a child. On the other hand, many people appeared willing to accept a death, their own or that of others, when it is felt that the person has lived out his or her full life span. That means that the death of an elderly person who has fulfilled the social roles of middle age such as parent and worker is thought to make sense in the "natural" order of things. Among deaths from illness, dementia and stroke are associated primarily with advanced age, whereas the others are thought to strike middle-aged people as well and are thus seen as especially tragic when death results. Among deaths not from illness, r?sui (what when I was a child we called "death from old age") is a category by definition limited to the elderly, whereas the others can affect people at any age. 35. For example, a man in his late 20s with non-Hodgkins lymphoma commented, "some guys?they're recovering alcoholics. Other guys are recovering drug addicts. I'll be a recover ing cancer patient."</page><page sequence="14">46 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) United States. Although Americans made distinctions by the age of the patient and the likelihood of death from various causes, without an ac knowledgment of something like "death from old age," all dying can be challenged as not being preordained. There is less willingness in the United States than in Japan, I perceive, to draw a line between those for whom the deterioration of the body should be accepted because of age or life stage and those who should be treated aggressively.36 Japanese doctors also frequently treat elderly patients aggressively, but they verbalize their doubts in terms of the patient's life stage. Among American doctors I observed, I heard ques tions raised more often in terms of the multiplicity of medical problems, such as "multiple organ system failure," in calculating whether further treat ment should be provided. The American hospital in which I observed is known for its doctors' willingness to perform heart surgery on people other hospitals will not touch because of age or the complexity of their cases. Yet I do not think that the attitudes of these physicians is unusual. Americans in general seem unwilling to ration scarce medical resources such as organs for transplantation on the basis of age as has been done in other countries such as Great Britain. At the other end of the life course, American doctors and parents were more willing to discuss letting a child die than were any of the Japanese with whom I spoke. In one p?diatrie step-down unit I observed in Japan, three of the nine beds were occupied by children whom I was told were in persistent vegetative state, one of whom had been there for 12 years. Neither the doc tors who now agonized over their "success" in keeping these children alive, nor the nurses who provided excellent physical and emotional care for them, nor their parents could consider discontinuing their treatment. In contrast was the case of Baby Carrie who was born in the United States with a severely defective heart and brain. Doctors believed that at most she would have minimal brain-stem function. The senior doctors be lieved they should continue their efforts to save her life, since she might live, although mentally retarded, to be 15 or 16 years old. Her parents were faced with the decision as to whether this newborn should begin a series of sur geries to repair her heart or to allow her to die without intervention. At a conference of approximately 20 people that lasted one hour,37 the parents 36. See the discussion of the lack of clarity historically as to whether aging is a disease in Sharon Kaufman, "Senescence, Decline, and the Quest for a Good Death: Contem porary Dilemmas and Historical Antecedents," Journal of Aging Studies, Vol. 14, No. 1 (2000), pp. 1-23. 37. In addition to the baby's parents, four representatives of the family's health mainte nance organization (HMO), a social worker, a chaplain, a bioethicist, three medical students, approximately seven physicians representing three departments who ranged in seniority from a first year resident to a department chairman with 30 years experience, several nurses, and my self as an observer attended the meeting.</page><page sequence="15">Long: The Good Death Al listened to detailed medical explanations of their daughter's condition and asked hard questions. That night they decided to request no further car diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if it became necessary (a "partial do-not resuscitate order") in spite of the continuing objection of the p?diatrie neu rologist. The mother at least had reached the conclusion that the baby was a gift from God to them as long as she lived and that they should take her home from the hospital. The father reluctantly agreed.38 In my six months at this American hospital, I was able to witness several such decisions that al lowed children to die without intensifying efforts at treatment. Time: Rapidity of Death Japan. Aside from r?sui, a gradual decline, all of the nonillness deaths occur suddenly. Pokkuri is a special category of sudden death that encom passes significant cultural values regarding the best ways to live and die.39 A 28-year-old specialist in internal medicine defined and evaluated such a death as follows: What kind of death would be ideal? Hmmm. Maybe pokkuri shinu. Sud denly, like when you get up and you're brushing your teeth and you have a cerebral hemorrhage and die, that would be best. Because you wouldn't have to worry about things. For example, at that time, this may be a very Japanese way of thinking, but anyway, there wouldn't be a period that you would have to fight the illness and face death directly. You wouldn't have to suffer with the complications of the disease and the inconvenience of being in the hospital for a long time. Yes, pokkuri death would be best. Although we might think of pokkuri as a contrast to a death drawn out in the hospital by high-tech medicine, the desire for pokkuri is not a new one.40 Hoffmann includes a poem in his collection from 1845, in which 75 year-old Rangai wrote: I wish to die a sudden death with eyes fixed on Mount Fuji.41 Indeed, there is a longstanding custom of praying for a sudden death at Buddhist temples, a practice that has taken on new meaning in an era of life expectancies of 76 years and 82 years for men and women, respectively. Fleur Woss has studied temples specializing in prayers for a pokkuri death. 38. Before Baby Carrie could be taken home, she had several episodes in which her breathing stopped. Her parents requested that the hospital chaplain baptize her rather than wait for a church ceremony after leaving the hospital. I do not know how long she survived. 39. Traphagan, Taming Oblivion, pp. 147-49. 40. See Young and Ikeuchi, "Religion in 'The Hateful Age,'" for a discussion of the reli gious historical background of pokkuri ideas and practices. 41. Hoffmann, Japanese Death Poems, p. 258.</page><page sequence="16">48 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) She defines pokkuri shinu as "to die suddenly, peacefully, and without long suffering." She finds that many of these temples have come to public aware ness of their specialization as a result of media attention on the new concern in the 1970s for the aging society and its accompanying problems of care giving. At the pokkuri temple she studied in Izu, 93 per cent of the wor shipers came because they did not wish to become bedridden and thus a bur den on other people. Another 18 per cent responded that they did not want to suffer with a long illness such as cancer. The great majority (80 per cent) of the worshipers were women,42 perhaps because of cultural images of the crone.43 Yet in my interviews and discussions, men also defined the ideal death as one that occurs suddenly, pokkuri, as in this informal comment by an elderly man who had experienced surgery seven times for colon cancer: "I'm unlucky because my heart is strong, so I'm going to have to go on suf fering. ... Pokkuri would be the best, but I'm not that lucky, I guess."44 Although some heart attacks and strokes may also result in sudden death, most of the deaths caused by illness involve some passage of time be tween diagnosis and death, time that often means pain, suffering, and de pendency on family and/or health care workers. Deaths due to illness and to r?sui have the potential to leave the person bedridden and thus a burden to others.45 A healthy, active woman in her 60s expressed, "You know about pokkuri temples? I'm wondering if I should start omairi [visiting a temple or shrine to pray]. Pokkuri would be good because I don't want to cause mei waku [trouble, burden] for my kids." Thus pokkuri is a quick death, as opposed to r?sui and deaths from ill ness. Although some people expressed advantages to a quick death such as 42. Fleur Woss, "Pokkuri Temples and Aging," in Mark R. Mullins, Shimazono Susumu, and Paul L. Swanson, eds., Religion and Society in Modern Japan (Berkeley: Asian Humani ties Press, 1993), pp. 191-202. 43. Susanne Formanek, "Views of the Crone in Pre-Meiji Japan," in Formanek and Lin hart, eds., Aging, pp. 107-29. 44. Other comments were less favorable to pokkuri because it is not limited to the elderly who had lived out their lives fully. For example, a 58-year-old man with congestive heart fail ure stated, "I have friends, colleagues who have died pokkuri, but I don't know the details of what happened. The best way is r?suika, when you just get to that age. . . . There is probably some pain. You can't die without pain. Maybe in pokkuri or a traffic accident there wouldn't be any [pain] for more than a second. The ideal to me is r?sui, because of age. I guess it would be after your late 70s. Pokkuri isn't ideal because it sometimes happens to young people." 45. I do not think that netakiri translates perfectly into English. It can mean bedridden in the American sense, but it sometimes seems to also refer to a life stage characterized as near death and almost full dependence on others. Some elderly who are netakiri are capable of more movement than they wish or are encouraged to do. Becoming netakiri represents a life transi tion. I remember going into a hospital room during my research in Japan to say hello to an el derly woman who was dying of cancer of the gall bladder and perhaps slightly demented. Al though she had been told that she had a tumor, she seemed to be in denial, once telling me when I asked that she was "getting much better." This time I asked her how she was doing and she replied, almost with a sense of accomplishment, "I'm netakiri now."</page><page sequence="17">Long: The Good Death 49 lack of suffering and not becoming a burden on others, people also believe a lingering death offers advantages not available to those who die suddenly. Some expressed a desire to prepare adequately for death, as a 38-year-old divorced woman with ulcerative colitis reckoned, I thought about suicide... but it would have been a lot of trouble for my fam ily. ... The ideal would be a death without pain... a heart attack, or suddenly falling over, or else just suddenly dying of old age. That would be ideal, but that's not available when you're young. I guess to die easily, it would have to be related to the heart.... So, as an ideal, it seems like I'd like something like pokkuri. But I'd also like to die after preparation, like arranging for my savings to go to my mother or brother, and handing over my clients. As this woman indicated, preparation may mean a readying of property distribution, role inheritance, or doing activities the person has always wanted to do.46 Sometimes "preparation" means conveying last messages to family and acquaintances. For some, there is also a psychological/spiritual dimension of readying oneself in order to face death calmly.47 This often came up when I asked people if they would want to be told if they had can cer. Those who did often referred to their desire to have time to prepare, both seishinteki ni (spiritually, mentally) and to arrange financial matters. Others, however, believe the spiritual/psychological dimension cannot be achieved by ordinary people, as a first-year medical resident confided, "I don't think people can overcome the fear of death. It's emotional, so even if you can un derstand what you hear, fighting the emotions will not make them go away; on the contrary it will be more upsetting."48 Time to prepare has thus become the rationale for disclosing a poor prognosis only to those for whom the practical aspects of readying is deemed necessary.49 But at least some members of the family are always told because, as observers have noted, death in Japan is thought to be social 46. Patients admitted to the hospice where I observed were routinely asked about such goals, which were recorded and used in care planning and later in assessment after a death. 47.

A 75-year-old man trying to care for his wife with cancer at home ex plained that as he himself grieved, he reassured his wife of their continuing relationship. My wife sometimes says, "I want to die. I don't want to be a burden." I feel so sad to hear that. But I know she is more sad, too. So I always tell her not to worry about that. We will meet each other again some time, somewhere, after finishing our lives on earth. I will take care of you [now]. Dying too quickly avoids burdening others, but it also robs people of the process of gradual adjustment and grieving that is part of the social experi ence of death. United States. Because of the medicalization of death, lay people may now associate sudden death with heart attack or stroke. At the opposite ex treme is "lingering," a slow death from something like cancer, or a dying prolonged by "artificial" means such as mechanical ventilation or tube feed ing. Many of the Americans who expressed favorable attitudes about living wills said things like this 38-year-old woman about the preferences of her husband (the patient): "He doesn't want to be put on life support if his brain is not working. We both feel like that. We don't want to linger." Like some of the Japanese, some Americans voiced the desire to have their "affairs in order" to prepare for death, although no one I spoke with brought up the kind of spiritual preparation some of the Japanese respon dents discussed. Several did mention, though, that they "have their life in or der" or that they "have lived a clean life" and so would be ready to accept death when it came. As one 63-year-old woman coming to the hospital for carotid artery surgery expressed, "I don't want to be on machines. I have my life in order." Pain, Suffering, and Becoming a Burden Japan. Pain was a major concern, perhaps the greatest concern in both countries, of nearly everyone with whom I spoke about dying. Over and over again, I heard Japanese family members tell physicians at the hospice or on the ward at the university hospital that they "just don't want her/him to suffer." No one suggested that there was any value to the physical suffer ing of the pain (unlike the value ascribed to seppuku according to Pinguet51), and all longed for a painless death. A number of people claimed that what they feared about their dying is pain, not death itself. For example, 50. Michael D. Fetters, "The Family in Medical Decision Making: Japanese Perspec tives," Journal of Clinical Ethics, Vol. 9, No. 2 (1998), pp. 143-57; LaFleur, Liquid Life; Lock and Honde, "Reaching Consensus"; Namihira, Inochi no bunka jinruigaku. 51.

I believe if you're a hu man being, death is part of life. It's the other side, like a sphere. The side the light is shining on is living, but the darker side is just as much part of the sphere. The only trouble is you can't come back to the light side! But that's part of life. I'm not afraid of it. ... I'm not afraid of death, but I do worry about pain. The only exception I heard was a cancer patient who said she would rather have cancer than be a burden with dementia or a stroke. However, she ac knowledged that she could say this because of the availability of hospice care and morphine. The opposite of a painful death is the ideal of dying yasuraka ni. Yasu raka can be translated as peaceful, calm, or comfortable. The character for yasuraka, also read as an, is the first character of the word anrakushi, a term that literally means comfortable or easy death but is the euphemism for eu thanasia. The conceptual overlap created by the presence of the yasuraka character in the word for euthanasia confuses the distinction so important to American bioethicists between "peaceful death" and "mercy killing." Where to draw a line between the two terms is not always clear to ordinary people with whom I spoke in Japan, thus the ambivalence of "understand ing" or even condoning euthanasia and at the same time opposing it as mur der.52 Even some people who do make the distinction believe that a pain-free death is so important that if requested, or if there is no means to control pain, euthanasia is morally acceptable. The term yasuraka ni shinu refers primarily in my data to physical com fort. At the hospice where I observed, the medical staff frequently discussed pain control among themselves and with patients and families, viewing this as the basis of their work. But there is also an element of spiritual and/or psychological calm implied by yasuraka, reflecting the common assump tion that the states of mind and body mirror each other, though I think most people would believe that relief of pain is a prerequisite for mental peace. But the distinction is not necessarily one that people feel the need to make. For example, there is a custom in which one or more family members come back to the hospital some days or weeks after a patient's death to thank the doctor and nurses, usually bringing a gift such as seasonal foods or sweets. In one discussion I observed in the hospice, the son and daughter in-law of a 74-year-old man who had died several weeks before expressed 52. Susan Orpett Long, "Ancestors, Computers, and Other Mixed Messages: Ambiguity and Euthanasia in Japan," Cambridge Quarterly for Healthcare Ethics, Vol. 10, No. 1 (2001), pp. 62-71.</page><page sequence="20">52 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1 (2003) their appreciation to the doctor: "I'm really glad we applied here. You all, doctors and nurses, really made it possible for him to die without suffering or pain, yasuraka ni" They continued talking about how peaceful his face was at the time of death, and the son expressed that he was grateful to the doctor for that. They commented that other relatives noticed the difference in the patient compared with his previous hospital, where presumably pain control had not been as good. Some writers have suggested that the peaceful appearance of the face at the time of death is important assurance to the survivors that they will not be plagued with a vengeful spirit, often used as a reason to deny permission to do an autopsy or donate organs.53 But it appears that for most people, a peaceful appearance of the face is less important as a reflection of the dead person's spiritual welfare than as a sign of assurance that the patient had not suffered and thus that the decisions made by the family and medical staff about the patient's care had been appropriate. A peaceful face serves as a kind of reward to the caregivers for fulfilling their responsibilities properly. People express great concern that a relative not suffer. Both r?sui and pokkuri represent deaths in which suffering is minimized, but in addition, deaths from illness can be yasuraka if there is appropriate medical care to control pain. The lack of conflict and an akarui (bright, cheerful) atmo sphere of caregiving, the presence of supportive family, and the patient's own self-cultivation or self-discipline may also contribute to a yasuraka dy ing, but the absence of pain is the key element in a peaceful death. United States. Like all of the Japanese with whom I spoke, Americans also wanted to die with a minimum of pain and suffering. I do not think there is a direct translation of the Japanese term yasuraka ni shinu, but the Amer ican terms "natural death" and "death with dignity" incorporate similar ideas. In American cultural stereotypes at least, Japanese culture glorifies seppuku (ritual suicide), a subcategory of ideal death that involves suffering for a cause, making a hero of the one who experiences the pain. I perceive a similarly stereotypical respect for Christian stoicism in the face of pain, a perception of a value in suffering, exemplified by the death of Jesus on the cross, if it brings meaning to the dying (as in the case of martyrdom). On the other hand, in neither country did the more "ordinary" people with whom I spoke see pain as adding meaning to their deaths, or to the in terpretation of their lives by the survivors, and they prefer to avoid it. An American man of about 40 said of his father, who had been diagnosed with cancer a year earlier, "My father is doing OK. He's stoic. He does what he has to. He's lost weight, so he doesn't look too good. He had six months of bad pain. That's gone now?that's all I care about." 53. Lock and Honde, "Reaching Consensus"; Namihira, Inochi no bunka jinruigaku; Ohnuki-Tierney, "Brain Death."</page><page sequence="21">Long: The Good Death 53 A 65-year-old nurse whose husband was being admitted for a heart catheterization also commented on the pain she has witnessed. "I've seen too many just [lie there]?I worked in a nursing home. We're at the stage when we refuse to let people go. Death isn't always the worst thing that can happen. Nobody wants to die, but sometimes it's worse to suffer." Her hus band added, "The way I've seen people suffer here, I can't think the devil would be any worse." The other side of suffering is the question of the burden on others. For the Japanese women praying at pokkuri temples for a quick death, burden on others was associated with the image of netakiri, being bedridden. Ameri cans also frequently talked about not wanting to be a burden on their fami lies. Sometimes that burden referred to family caregiving, noting that hav ing a family member so sick affects the "family quality of life," or that dying with extensive life support was "not fair to the family." Not infrequently ref erence was made to the burdens of making difficult decisions, of watching a loved one "lingering" hooked up to tubes and machines, and of paying for all of that treatment. As a 38-year-old woman being admitted to the hospi tal for tests explained, "If I'm brain dead, I don't want to take my family through the pain. The cost rises every day." Concerns for family emotional and financial burden were expressed by men and women, native-born and immigrant Americans, blacks and whites, younger and older adults. Whereas the concern of many Japanese for dependency was related to the burden of family members providing exhausting physical care, Ameri cans were more adamant about maintaining their personal independence, es pecially their cognitive independence. Several people told me about some one in their family who had lost their independence or mental competence, and expressed that they would not want to go on living in such a situation. One 54-year-old man, a retired machine operator admitted for "fluid reten tion," stated, Dad had a stroke?he was just lying there. The doctor said no matter what they did he'd be that way. I knew what he had wanted. My aunt was in the same situation, she lingered on a respirator. Everything was so artificial? she could not do anything for herself. I don't want that for myself. I guess it's just a matter of what we've experienced. Others expressed how terrible it was to see family members who had lost consciousness and were no longer "themselves." The common American belief that physical, and especially mental, de pendence is so abnormal as to no longer be human is the basis of the meta phor of "being a vegetable," as so vividly expressed by the man quoted in the title of this article, who didn't want to be a cucumber. Although the phrase "human vegetable" {shokubutsu ningen) or "vegetative state" (shokubutsu j?tai) was not unknown to lay people in Japan who occasion</page><page sequence="22">54 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) ally even made reference to the Karen Quinlan case, it rarely came up in dis cussion unless I specifically asked about the terms. When I did, most people, including nurses and physicians, did not carefully distinguish between brain death and persistent vegetative state (death of the neocortex but continued functioning of the brain stem). The terms vegetable or vegetative state came up continually in talking with Americans about dying as a state to be avoided. A 62-year-old police officer hospitalized for cardiac testing, for ex ample, explained, "If I was in a state of [being a] vegetable, I wouldn't de sire to continue if I had the choice. If I'm in a coma, don't pull the plug, or if it's a stroke, because you don't know. But if I'm brain dead, then it's worth less. If the brain is dead then the soul is gone." His contrast between being a "vegetable" and other situations utilized a religious image of the soul. Others voiced a more secular definition, that be ing a vegetable meant living only through a machine, a state they thought in opposition to living as a human. The brother of a 58-year-old patient ex plained, describing a niece who had a stroke in her 30s, "That's not life as it should be. By six months [on life support] you're a vegetable anyway." An other patient, a 67-year-old whose wife works in a nursing home, drew a dif ferent time line but agreed with the conclusion: "I wouldn't want to stay with life support more than one week." Or yet another patient, a 45-year-old man, stated simply, "I don't want to be a vegetable?that's not living." For these people who talked about being a vegetable, the emphasis was on the contrast between living on life-supporting equipment and living as a human. Others focused on specific ways in which such "vegetables" had lost their humanity. In a meeting between a staff bioethicist at the hospital and the middle-aged children of a woman who was not doing well after surgery, one of the sons explained that his mother had wanted to remain independent. To her, getting around, eating, toileting herself, and living in her own house were critical to her sense of being human. The son concluded by saying, "She didn't want to be a vegetable, to be in a vegetative state." A 58-year-old woman about to undergo her second heart surgery was concerned about the loss of sociability: "If I'm a vegetable, forget it. Don't put me on a machine. I wouldn't know what I'm doing anyway. I won't rec ognize anyone. You see people on TV where the family comes to visit and the person doesn't even recognize them. It's sad." Being a "vegetable" then, is being something other than human because it involves total dependency without the ability to engage in human rela tionships, to think, or even to be aware of one's surroundings.54 Many Amer icans feel strongly that they do not want to "live" this way. Although I think many Japanese would agree, they do not use the vegetable metaphor, per 54. Note the similar concern regarding senility in Japan discussed in Traphagan, Taming Oblivion.</page><page sequence="23">Long: The Good Death 55 haps because the notion of personhood is centered elsewhere than the brain and because physical dependency is more acceptable if not desirable.55 The Environment of Dying Japan. The environment in which the death occurs is a highly significant concern. In both countries, deaths from illness generally take place in a hos pital, surrounded by medical equipment. People envision that life-prolonging treatments involving invasive tubing and monitors accompany hospital dy ing. The environment fox pokkuri, by contrast, is more familiar, since it pre sumably takes place at home, at work, or at play, and is thus seen as more desirable. But the ideal environment to die for many people is at home. For elderly people in Japan, the phrase tatami no ue ni shinu, literally "dying on tatami," captures this sentiment, but even those who do not use those terms express a desire to go home or to remain at home. This desire, however, comes into conflict with other values, for example, the wish to not become a burden. Many patients also feel the obligation to continue to fight their illness (ganbaru) and believe they should be hospitalized to obtain the best medical care available. In other cases, the goal of yasuraka ni shinu, dy ing comfortably, requires admission to a hospital for adequate pain control. Until recently, it was sometimes financially advantageous as well to remain in the hospital, but new efforts at cost control in the national medical insur ance system have increased patient costs. The development of home nursing services, improved reimbursement for physician house calls, and the begin nings of a home hospice movement will help those people who wish to die at home realize this ideal in the future.56 When I asked people about the meaning of dying on tatami, they re sponded unanimously that it meant dying in one's own home surrounded by family. A few of the responses were more graphic. For example, for a pro fessional in his 40s, "It's not having all of the tubes. It's being in a familiar living environment with your own family, in your own home, under your own futon, cared for by your family, and there quietly drawing your breaths?I think that's what tatami no ue ni shinitai means." For some people there is a sense of nostalgia associated with dying on tatami. I began to ask people if tatami itself made any difference since the point seemed only to be at home. Two people mentioned that the character istic smell of tatami was part of the image and might be especially reassur 55.

All three of the hospice or palliative care wards I ob served had at least one tatami room?not home, but an effort to simulate the kind of home environment envisioned in the notion of tatami no ue ni shinu. The director of one of them pointed out that some patients were too far from home to return there, so the tatami room gave them the opportunity to have their families with them for their last few days, where they could "line up their futon along side each other." The emotional/social significance of sleeping together in Japan is well known57 and is a means of providing com pany and reassurance in elder care as well as for children.58 Buddhism spe cialist Carl Becker told me about a pretest of a study he was doing on the ideal environment for dying to aid in Japanese hospice design. Among the university students he asked in an open-ended questionnaire, a large number of these young people related that their ideal room would be an (atypically) large tatami room from which they could look out onto nature.59 A conver sation at a hospice in a different context than dying led me to recognize the further association many Japanese have of sitting around a low table (or ko tatsu) on tatami drinking tea, a context imagined to be timeless, in which si lence communicates and consideration for the other is central to interaction. It is this connection to an idealized past, along with the presence of fam ily, that is significant about tatami. The connection may be even broader, since in many homes I visited where an elderly person was ill, his or her bed, whether futon or a hospital bed, was in the room with the family butsudan (altar).60 A sense of connection to the past, to family, and to the world of spirits was poignantly expressed by Mrs. Kikuchi, a 64-year-old woman in the hospice due to breast cancer which had spread widely through her body. She coped with her fear by talking well beyond what the doctors felt they had time to hear: Mrs. Kikuchi: I want to live until August 15. Dr. Kimura: Why that date? Is that your birthday? Mrs. Kikuchi: Father will come back for Obon and so I can meet him. . . . He can take me to [the other world] and be my teacher [sensei]. 57. William Caudill and David W. Plath, "Who Sleeps by Whom?

After discussing the various arrangements we had seen, we wonder if the practical concern here is for space rather than atmosphere, especially when a large hos pital bed is in use. Since I conducted fieldwork in urban and suburban areas, the largest room in the home was likely the room with the butsudan, whereas in more spacious rural homes, per haps there were more options for placement of such a bed.</page><page sequence="25">Long: The Good Death 57 Dr. Kimura: That's a good idea, but I don't know if things will work out that way. Mrs. Kikuchi [with some frustration]: It's my dream \yume], Doctor! Nineteenth-century poet Shinga expressed a similar sentiment, Feast of the Dead: a fitting time to die.61 But most people I asked were less nostalgic about tatami, noting that the matting itself was largely irrelevant compared with the image of home and family that represents for many the ideal death. In a 1990 national survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, over half (53.3 per cent) of the respon dents stated that if they had terminal cancer, they would like to have their nursing care at home, as opposed to 28.1 per cent who selected a hospital and 11.1 per cent who selected a hospital for the terminally ill.62 Most of the people I spoke with stressed that going home, in the case of tatami no ue ni shinitai, meant having family there. As a nurse in her 20s re plied when I asked what was meant by tatami no ue ni shinitai, "Being in the place where you've been living, watched over by everyone. I'm not sure, but this kind of bleak place [the hospital] would be really lonely." Thirty-seven-year-old Ms. Sumitomo, an unmarried hospice patient with uterine cancer, was struggling with a decision as to whether to go home, which would be burdensome to her family, or to stay in the hospital, which would be lonely. But as the doctor quoted above pointed out, going home may not truly be a return to the family bosom as social change has meant an increased number of elderly living alone. For some people then, staying in the hospital is less lonely, as a nurse noted about one very social cancer patient on the university hospital ward. Some people may also want to go home for financial reasons. Being at home can represent the ideal, as in the case of an elderly patriarch of a four-generation family who looked out from his hospital bed on tatami over his beautiful garden while his daughter-in-law took care of him. However, I also saw cases in which home care seemed to represent a lack of options, as with the Kobe woman in her 61. Hoffmann, Japanese Death Poems, p. 294. 62. K?seish?, K?sei hakusho (Tokyo: K?seish?, 1995), p. 41. However, a similar question in the 1993 Yomiuri National Public Opinion Poll asked where it would be best for the patient with terminal cancer to receive treatment. The responses were 33.3 per cent at home, 26.3 per cent in the hospital, and 36.5 per cent in a hospital specializing in care for terminal cancer pa tients.

The public rhetoric is perhaps more strident. Ei, a TV personality who is the son of a Buddhist priest, quotes an unidentified (and thus presumably "ordinary") person as saying that "it doesn't matter if death takes place in the hospital or at home?the question is who will care for me when I'm dy ing." Ei then adds his own comment, "I don't want to die surrounded by medical equipment and technicians in the intensive care unit [ICU], but rather by family and friends."63 Another expert, a medical journalist, was more blatant in his critique of dying in a hospital than were the patients and family members I interviewed: Old people in the countryside and people in the olden days saw death and accepted that when they got old, this is what happened to each generation in turn. But today, dying is separated from most people because 80-90 per cent of deaths take place in the hospital. Do you know what happens when someone dies in the hospital? When they die, the family is sent from the room. They're told not to cry too loudly because it will disturb the other pa tients. And then the doctors practice CPR on the body. When they're done, the body is cold. It is cleaned and the family comes back in. Then the body is taken to the corpse room, which is always in the basement. It's near where they take out the garbage! I think that is not a very human way to die, and I think that as long as it's in the hospital, which is centered around medi cal treatment, that's how it will be. Most people say they want to die at home .... the idea of family being around. That's a better way to die.64 United States. Since the metaphor of the vegetable is so pervasive, it would seem that Americans' main image of death is that of a comatose pa tient in a sterile hospital room, hooked up to numerous machines, with tubes going in and out of the body. Like the Japanese patients and family mem bers, many Americans view this medicalized death as a "bad death." Amer icans talk about a "natural death" or a "death with dignity" as a more posi tive alternative. A natural death or death with dignity might take place in a hospital or nursing home, but it is perhaps more difficult to achieve in these 63. Ei, Dai?j?, pp. 85-86. 64. Yamazaki, Dying in a Japanese Hospital, offers similar scenarios of dying in a Japa nese hospital. Dying at home might come to be even more valued after a long stay in the hos pital, a 47-year-old retail employee I interviewed suggested: [Tatami no ue] is not an expression I use. I imagine it means in your own house, with family around. Maybe that would be something people in the hospital for a long time, like a year, would want. They might feel that way about their own home. I was only in the hospital for two months and was able to go home on weekends. My friends would come over and we would play music, so I never had that feeling. But tatami no ue might represent a kind of freedom?from expectations, from worrying about others. It's also a getting rid of all the tubes. It might be very Japanese?one's own house \jibun no tsuya; wagaya]?the value of one's own home, so dying there might be valued.</page><page sequence="27">Long: The Good Death 59 settings. Some Americans, like many Japanese with whom I spoke, ex pressed a desire to die at home. During a lecture to a community elder class about my research, I explained the Japanese notion of tatami no ue. One woman, probably in her 70s, raised her hand and asked, "Isn't that what we all want? To be in our own home with our family around and to just put our head down on our kitchen table?" There was laughter at the contrast be tween tatami and a kitchen table, but a number of her peers nodded in agree ment with her ideal. The ideal of dying at home may be difficult to achieve, but sometimes medical staff and family cooperate to make it possible. Mr. Caprio was a man in his 70s who had suffered several strokes and clearly expressed his desire to go home. The attending physician and family agreed. About a week after his discharge from the hospital I asked his doctor if he knew how Mr. Caprio was doing. He replied, obviously fostering Mr. Caprio's choice, He's at home now and seems more comfortable. I went out there yesterday. He is getting home care; [the therapists] are doing a good job. He sleeps most of the time, but wakes up, waves at his family. He told his wife he'd see her in heaven. The family has really rallied around. Of course, there is a significant difference in the meaning of going home to die in the United States and in Japan. The Japanese medical system pro vides financial incentives to keep patients in the hospital; the American, es pecially managed care systems, are designed to push people out into home or nursing home care. I did hear discussion frequently in the American hos pital about sending patients home, and social workers spent most of their time doing "discharge planning," arranging for nursing home admission or for home health services. In cases in which patients expressed a desire to go home, or family members wanted to take them home, the physicians I ob served did everything they could to stabilize the patient to facilitate that wish. Is it that Americans get good terminal care which allows dying pa tients to be in their preferred environment, or is it merely good financial management of health care resources? Japanese doctors and patients are as tounded to hear the condition in which American patients are discharged. Americans are incredulous that the average length of stay for Japanese pa tients is about 30 days. Good Deaths, Bad Deaths: American and Japanese Perspectives Multiple Meanings ofi(Natural Death " in Japan How do all of these images of ideal and poor dying come together? In general, it appears that although illness is part of nature, the pain, depen dency, and hospital environment in which it is treated makes it a "bad" death. In contrast, r?sui and pokkurishi are defined as "natural," and because</page><page sequence="28">60 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) of their minimal pain and lack of medicalization, they represent different forms of "good" death. I would suggest that another opposition lies in the "naturalness" of these deaths with the "unnaturalness" of deaths from sui cide, homicide, traffic accidents, house fires, and so on which result from so cietal/human causes.65 Although the term "natural death" was largely unfa miliar to the nonphysicians I asked, I frequently heard the term "naturally" (shizen ni, shizen no mama) used in a variety of contexts. In analyzing the use of these phrases, I found three overlapping meanings. 1. In its narrowest sense, "naturally" refers to a death that occurs with out illness or societal responsibility, in other words, r?sui and pokkuri, as in the explanation of "natural death" given by a 21-year-old college student: "Natural death is when an old farmer working out in the field just drops over." Or, as a 52-year-old doctor put it, "It's when the death isn't from a traffic accident or war or murder or things like that. And it wouldn't include illness. It wouldn't matter if it were at home or in the hospital... I guess ag ing is the real natural death." 2. In a slightly broader context, "natural" is opposed to "medicalized" death. For example, a young couple had come to consult with the hospice head nurse about whether they should agree to a procedure for their father at another hospital that would prolong his life with cancer. In her response, she referred to "letting nature take its course." Others defined "natural death" as without tubes. A 73-year-old woman with heart valve disease who explained that she did not want to become a burden on her daughter-in-law commented, "When I first came here, I told the nurses that I wanted a natu ral death [shizenshi shite itadakitai], no emergency measures. If the doctors think it's over, don't even give me oxygen or an IV." A middle-aged hematologist explained that when he tells family mem bers that their relative's life is in danger, if they express that they want the relative to go "naturally," he interprets that to mean not doing treatment to prolong life such as putting the patient on a ventilator or doing CPR or giv ing heart-supporting drugs. "But if the patient becomes unable to take food by mouth, I think it is alright to put in a central line for nutrition." Both of these meanings, the narrowest and the broader nonmedical meanings, are related to the concept of yasuraka ni, dying comfortably and 65. Brain death, arising primarily from accidents, would seem then to be classified as "un natural." Variations in the interpretation and significance of this distinction undoubtedly influenced the debate in the 1990s about brain death and cadaver organ transplantation in Ja pan. For different perspectives on this debate in English, see Eric Feldman, "Over My Dead Body: The Enigma and Economics of Death in Japan," in Naoki Ikegami and John Creighton Campbell, eds., Containing Health Care Costs in Japan (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), pp. 234-47; Lock, Twice Dead; Lock and Honde, "Reaching Consensus"; and Ohnuki-Tierney, "Brain Death."</page><page sequence="29">Long: The Good Death 61 peaceably. The word shizuka ni (quietly) was often associated with this idea as people talked about it. 3. The third sense in which "natural" is used is the most abstract, philo sophical approach to death. This was voiced by a 60-year-old man who had experienced a stroke himself and who had cared for a wife with Alzheimer's disease until she had to be hospitalized. He explained the importance he felt of living his natural life span: The ideal death is dying at home, with my hands held by my family. I dis agree with euthanasia [anrakushi] because everyone should live one's al lotted life. Pain control is one way to do this ... I [felt like I wanted to die] once 25 years ago when I was 35.1 was having a hard time in my job. I was so stressed and couldn't find my own value to living [sonzai kachi]. Once I thought about suicide. I decided to hide myself in a mountain retreat. I re alized that human beings are so small compared to the universe. Life is given by something beyond human beings_So I think people need to live out their allotted lives, (interview by Phyllis Braudy Harris and Miwa Fu jii; translation by Miwa Fujii) This definition is frequently mixed in discussion with the nonmedical definition. I believe this combination of the second and third meanings of "natural" dying constitutes the Japanese term usually translated as "peace ful death" (dai?j?), the good death. While it is possible to have a good death from illness, even in the hospital, it must be a death without pain and suf fering and without futile attempts to prolong the dying process. The pres ence of family at the time of death, in the form of tatami no ue or shinime ni au (being there at the time of death),66 validates the meaning of this ideal death for the survivors who can appreciate the "peaceful face" of the corpse. It is interesting to note that with the exception of r?sui and pokkuri, which are considered "natural" dying, it is precisely through culture (as defined by the anthropologist), not nature (as defined by those being inter viewed), that deaths become "good deaths." Dying is made less painful through palliative care, by the administration of medication, or through massage and other forms of touching. Or, in the extreme, the pain is taken by the act of euthanasia, a sacrifice by both the patient and the survivors who have facilitated it. The environment of dying is modified, even in the hospi tal, toward the ideal of tatami no ue ni shinu by the presence and caregiving activities of family members, heavily symbolic behavior. The creation of the proper emotional atmosphere may also be the responsibility of the staff at a hospice, but it was at the hospice where the participation of family was most encouraged and facilitated. Hospice and decisions against continued ag 66. See Michael D. Fetters and Marion Danis, "Death with Dignity: Perspectives on Car diopulmonary Resuscitation in the United States and Japan," in H. Tristan Engelhardt, ed., Hoshino Festschrift (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="30">62 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) gressive therapy even in other hospitals are a final cultural method of creat ing a "good death" by moving the dying process from that of a medicalized battle to one of acceptance of "nature." What Is Natural? The Theme of Choice in the United States The cultural revivalist script incorporates ideas about a "natural death" in opposition to a medicalized one. Yet what is "natural" is open to multiple interpretations, as in Japan. In contemporary American society, "the good death" is expected to vary with the individual.67 One theme that emerged consistently in discussions with Americans was that death had to do with ac tive choice, by the dying person, the family, the medical staff, or God. This presents a strong contrast with the widest sense of "natural" that I described among my Japanese informants. Although there is a strong emphasis on "fighting" illness by Japanese doctors and patients, the underlying concep tion is that dying is part of a natural process of living, one that can be post poned but the basic principle remains unaltered. Thus the focus of talk about death in Japan is descriptive. Whereas Americans might agree intellectually with the tenet that death is a natural part of life, their talk about death fo cuses less on various terms that label ways of dying and more on the activ ity of constructing a good death.68 But whose choice it is believed to be varies greatly among Americans, with significant consequences for both attitude and behavior. Some people focused on the choice of the humans involved. Most people interviewed fa vored advance directives such as living wills because they were thought to provide patients (as opposed to doctors or family members) the opportunity to make decisions.69 A 60-year-old woman who was a cardiac patient be lieved (incorrectly) that, If you don't have a living will, you don't have a choice. It's a legal thing. Doctors have to go ahead with it, and the family can't have any say in it. And it's a legal deal. Once it's on, they can't turn it off. I heard about the experi ence of a woman who wanted to check with her sisters concerning putting their mother on life support. When she came back the next morning it was too late. She was already on the machines. 67. Walter, The Revival of Death; Seale, Constructing Death. 68. This notion of choice is generally discussed in academic studies in terms of the indi viduation of death in postmodern society. See, for example, Walter, The Revival of Death, and Charmaz, Howarth, and Kellehear, The Unknown Country. 69. This favorable attitude did not mean that everyone had signed one. In fact, only one fourth of those people interviewed had a living will and fewer than 14 per cent had a durable power of attorney for health care.</page><page sequence="31">Long: The Good Death 63 A number of people expressed concern for sparing their families the ne cessity of making difficult decisions, as did this wife of a 62-year-old patient hospitalized for possible bypass surgery. A living will is for making our own decisions about what we want done so the loved ones left don't have to make it. . . . Many people wish their par ents had one so they didn't have to make the decision. ... [I have a living will so I will] not be putting the burden on other people. Others emphasized the element of control that individuals should have over their own dying. A 50-year-old wife of a patient asked that someone talk to her husband about advance directives after he got out of the intensive care unit. They had received information in the preadmission packet the hos pital had sent to their home. "We talked about it. He has his own ideas of what to do. I can't decide for him." In contrast to those who emphasized human control were those who be lieved strongly that dying was not a matter of human choice, but rather of God's. I was struck by the extent of religious phraseology I heard in the hos pital, one without any past or present religious affiliation. The God of these people was not an impersonal spirit or the laws of nature (which would be more similar to the Japanese broadest approach to the idea of "natural death"), but rather an anthropomorphic, omnipotent (male) director of the universe. People often spoke to each other as well as to me in phrases such as "leaving it in God's hands," "God takes them when He's ready," "only God can terminate a life," and "let Him do what He wants." One person who opposed advance directives believed that such forms do "what God should decide." Those who believe that death is God's decision do not necessarily agree about continuing or discontinuing treatment. Some assert that human inter vention opposes God's will. "God'll make the decision when we go, and there won't be no machines," explained a 45-year-old woman who was ac companying a friend from another city to the hospital for cancer treatment. In contrast, others like the 38-year-old wife of a patient with liver disease, expressed that "God gave us doctors and machines, so we should use them." Some people are not sure. Gerontologist Tom Koch relates an internet "con versation" he studied, with the participants' permission, in which a man so licited advice from others in the computer discussion group about terminat ing treatment for his mother. This man wondered if by terminating life support he would be "messing with God's territory," or if "God's territory already has been transgressed, and must now be set right."70 70. Tom Koch, "The Gulf Between: Surrogate Choices, Physician Instructions, and In formal Network Responses," Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, Vol. 4 (1995), p. 187.</page><page sequence="32">64 Journal of Japanese Studies 29:1(2003) What this focus on decisions and choices means is that there is much more discussion than in Japan of things such as discontinuing treatment and do-not-resuscitate orders. This is not to say that there is no denial on the part of Americans; there is plenty. Yet conversation in and out of the hospital seems more likely to include the topic of dying. The Human-Machine Opposition The extremely negative image of medicalized dying in hospitals in Ja pan and in the United States is similar but is reflected in slightly different metaphors. The Japanese discourse emphasizes acceptance of or opposition to the use of enmei chiry?, life-prolonging therapies. This refers less to the tubes themselves than to the various chemicals that enter the body through them: artificial nutrition and hydration, antibiotics to treat pneumonia in a patient with end-stage cancer, medicine to support blood pressure, oxygen, and so on.71 Although the term enmei chiry? was used in a general sense to refer to life support, I never heard it used specifically to refer to ventilator support, or in conjunction with the mechanical metaphors often used by Americans. In contrast, the American polemic centers on "life supports," which can mean all of those things, but more directly suggests to the lay people with whom I spoke the medical devices that deliver those treatments. In other words, it is machines, and the ventilator in particular, that provide the key metaphor for the image of horror of the medicalized death. That metaphor is evidenced when Americans (but not Japanese) frequently talk about "pulling the plug," "shutting off the switch," "hooking me up," or any of the variety of these extensions of the mechanical metaphor. As a widowed 71 year-old American woman coming to the hospital for angioplasty put it, "If there was no way of getting well; we don't believe in being vegetables? prolonging life by machine. Either you're a human being or you're not, and if machines take over you're not human any more." The strong opposition between being "naturally" alive as a human and being dependent on a machine "artificially" comes across clearly in many of my American interviews. A man of about 40 receiving cancer therapy ex pressed, "I lost a brother-in-law to an aneurism. He was just there with ma chines keeping him alive, but he wasn't really. So you just have to pull the plug." A 53-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis insisted, "You don't 71. A reviewer of an earlier draft of this article raised the question of how this concern squares with the well-known propensity of the Japanese public for consuming large amounts of pharmaceutical products, nutritional drinks, etc. My response is that there is clearly am bivalence?complaints about overuse, disposing of drugs considered excessive by patients? while, at the same time, belief that drugs do help, may save lives, restore bodily balance, and so on. Perhaps they are so symbolically powerful precisely because of this ambivalence.</page><page sequence="33">Long: The Good Death 65 want life maintained on machines, in other words, you're not really living." A 57-year-old man about to be assessed for a heart transplant explained his own views. "If I'm dead, don't keep me alive. If I'm not going to recover, I don't want to be there. If there's no hope, pull it. I could be a brain stem for 20 years." For at least one man speaking from a religious worldview, a 69 year-old accompanying his brother to the hospital for cancer and heart prob lems, God is on the side of nature: "God'll make the decision when we go? and there won't be no machines." Thus, to Americans thinking about death, the machine is analogous to the vegetable in that both are opposed to human life. Life-support machines are what allow the confusion between life and death by keeping the body breathing and fed while the human, the person, the soul is no longer there. The ambiguity of this "betwixt and between" state, I suggest, is as frighten ing in our postindustrial societies as are notions of purgatory and hungry ghosts in other times and places. Furthermore, this understanding of medi cal machines removes the responsibility for that awful state away from the doctors, technicians, and family members who apply the technology and ambivalently (because many patients believed firmly in "scientific pro gress") transfers it to the machines themselves. This understanding of what it means to be human, neither vegetable nor machine, is at the root of Amer ican understandings of "death with dignity" and "natural death." In contrast, some people with whom I spoke, including religious funda mentalists of Christian, Moslem, and Jewish backgrounds, had a differeftt view of medical machines. They found it unacceptable to stop aggressive treatment, since death is something only God decides; to turn off a ventila tor or to not treat pneumonia when drugs are available is defined as murder. In this worldview, control should not be exercised by humans alone, but through divine intervention. If machines had been invented and medicines discovered by humans, it was God's will that they be used for good, and sav ing a life is an unquestionable "good." Faith, prayer, and religious music were sometimes included, along with lack of pain and the comfort of fam ily and friends, as elements of dying well. These Americans saw no funda mental opposition between nature and culture, or between nature and ma chine because human culture is seen not as a matter of human control but as part of God's plan. The lack of a clear-cut boundary between nature and cul ture in this worldview is reminiscent of writing about Japan.72 Although the 72.

Ideals and Realities In both Japan and the United States, dying has been medicalized; most deaths occur in hospitals where a "natural death" must take on new mean ings in postindustrial contexts. Rarely does "natural death" refer to the way that life comes to an end in nature. Rather, the goal of achieving a "good death" takes precedence, and the "naturalness" of such a death must come from the social and cultural manipulation of the cause, timing, suffering, and the physicial and interpersonal environments in which death occurs. The majority of Japanese and Americans expressed similar categories of good and bad deaths if drawn in broad strokes. Despite individual varia tion in both countries, a number of themes emerged from my interviews and observations that were common, though not universal, to people in both countries. For most people, the goal of a good death is a peaceful death. The basis of such a peaceful death is that the last stage of life is pain-free. Hu man suffering?not only physical suffering, but also the mental anguish represented by the strong concern expressed in both countries that one not become a burden on family?should be minimized. Yet a good death is also one in which the dying person is surrounded by caring family, reflecting and creating an ambivalence about the social nature of dying. People in both countries desire recognition of a continuity from living through dying and hold the belief that death was, or should be, a personalized experience ap propriate to that person's values and life conditions. The opposite of dying well, for most Americans and for most Japanese, is lying in a hospital bed half-dead/half-alive, hooked up to numerous medical devices supplying various chemicals, deserted by all but nurses who occasionally appear to perform some manipulation of the body-with-its-artificial-appendages, no longer able to be oneself. In the parlance of the American man who inspired my title, people do not want to be "cucumbers." Yet despite these common notions about dying well, the ways that Jap anese and Americans expressed their ideas were culturally specific. Japa nese people spoke of pokkuri and r?sui, of faces that were yasuraka, of dy ing on tatami, and of receiving enmei chiry? through tubes to keep dying patients alive. The Japanese image of horror, of dying poorly, is dying alone, or of doctors practicing CPR on a corpse while the family waits in the hall way. American expressions focused on choice, utilizing religious and me chanical metaphors. Americans spoke of the nightmare of "lingering" on a machine as a vegetable. These metaphors suggest that different concerns un derlie the cross-cultural similarities. For example, although people in both</page><page sequence="35">Long: The Good Death 67 countries dread becoming a burden on their families, for Japanese the bur den usually referred to the stresses of physical caregiving. Americans ex pressed their wishes about how to die in order to spare family members from having to make difficult decisions about discontinuing treatment; and lack ing the universal health insurance coverage of Japan, Americans were also more concerned about draining their families' finances. Thus the interpreta tion of not wanting to be a burden reflected people's social experiences. The most significant difference in interpreting common notions of a good death was in what people meant by a "natural death." In Japan, "natu ral" is dying either suddenly or gradually that is not caused by society or by illness. It is a nonmedicalized death, but one in which pain is minimized and intimate human contact maximized, both through cultural means. In the United States, a natural death is one that rejects dependency on the artificial, especially mechanical means of maintaining life. In contrast to the broadest meaning of natural death in Japan, which emphasized human life as part of the ongoing process of all life, American metaphors insist on the difference between human life and other forms of life (as well expressed in the vege table metaphor). Humans are unlike vegetables because they are mobile but also because they are capable of emotion and meaningful interaction with others.731 find it ironic that both societies label the uniquely human process of controlled dying as "natural." Differences in what is "natural" and the ex tent to which human control is recognized and legitimated depend on the extent to which nature and culture or nature and machine are symbolically opposed. Nonetheless, cultural differences should not be overdrawn. In both countries, there is a discrepancy between the reality of life and these images 73. The contrast between human and vegetable so significant to many Americans is ex plicitly denied in some forms of Japanese Buddhism (and more broadly, in Mahayana Bud dhism) which proclaim the universal Buddha nature of all things. Dogen, for example, "be lieved that mountains, trees, water, and all the manifestations of Reality, including human beings, were the Buddha Nature" (Alice Matsunaga and Daigen Matsunaga, Foundation of Japanese Buddhism, Vol. II [Los Angeles: Buddhist Books International, 1976], p. 249). This Japanese Zen perspective is expressed in an eighteenth-century painting by It? Jakuchu entitled Yasai Nehan (Vegetable Nirvana). It utilizes a standard composition for por traying the death of Buddha but substitutes a daikon radish for the dying Buddha and other veg etables for the disciples and mourners. Shimizu explains that the radish symbolized humility, frugality, and the simple, ascetic lifestyle of monks. He continues: "The implication of the con tent of the Yasai Nehan is that the issue of life and death for all beings, sentient or insentient, always returns to the essential teaching of the Buddha. Blurring the conventional distinction of things, this message applies as much to vegetables as to humans." Yoshiaki Shimizu, "Multiple Commemorations: The Vegetable Nehan of It? Jakuch?," in James H. Sanford, William R. LaFleur, and Masatoshi Nagatomi, eds., Flowing Traces: Buddhism in the Literary and Visual Arts of Japan (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), p. 232. The contrast with Judeo Christian ideas of salvation is striking.

There is great variety in both countries of value priorities and of how these images are utilized in actual decision making that involves not only ideas but social power. Experts may define ways of dying as good or bad, right or wrong, but this rhetoric becomes symbolic as ordinary people variously in terpret ideas and metaphors to fit their own experiences, circumstances, and beliefs. Ordinary people in both countries experience tremendous ambiva lence in both wanting to save lives (their own or others) and wanting to avoid the betwixt-and-between of being neither humanly alive nor finally dead, and so draw from multiple scripts as they face death. This article points to the need to understand the images of various ways of dying that are part of the daily experiences of living in a specific society that makes particular assumptions about the relation of human culture to na ture. Yet these images alone do not determine behavior, any more than the pronouncements of religious leaders assure desired outcomes. The notions of good and bad deaths that I have identified do not stand alone but shape behavior that is negotiated in interpersonal and institutional contexts, en couraging or constraining the realization of the ideals. Variation within so cieties may be as great as variation between. Choices that people make about dying reflect the accumulated experiences of their lives, legitimated by the notions of good and bad deaths that these experiences have generated.
