The 6th-century mosaic, known as ';Virgin Mary and Child", depicted the Virgin Mary in a sitting position, holding Jesus to her bosom, and surrounded by archan- gels (which were already damaged). The mosaic also represented the twelve apostles in medallions. Two renderings of the mosaic can be found in Cyprus: Byzantine Mosaics and Frescoes, UNESCO World Art Series published by the New York Graphic Society by arrangement with UNESCO ( 1963).

American Society for Industrial Security: Overlap with Archaeology The American Society for IndustriaZ Security is the professionaZ association for security peopZe. At first gZance, it might nor appear to be an organization of great interest to archaeoZogists, but severaZ paragraphs in a recent membership appeaZ suggested that we might share some areas of concern. Thus, your editor invited Steven R. Ke//er, Director of the Department of Protection Services at the Art Institute of Chicago and Chairman of the A.S.I.S. Museum, Library and Archive Committee, to outZine some of the current goaZs of that Committee for JFA readers. We hope that opening the Zines of communication and cooperation with this, and the other organizations mentioned in these pages fiom time to time, may Zead to increased effectiveness and benefits for a1M invoZved. The Museum, Library and Archive Committee is a Standing Committee of the American Society for Indus- trial Security. It is composed of security people from museums and other cultural properties and law enforce- ment personnel engaged in finding stolen items. A.S.I.S. has asked each Standing Committee to es- tablish a subcommittee whose task it is to develop an annotated bibliography encompassing the vast majority of published items in their specialized area of security. We, therefore, will work toward developing such a bib- liography on the topics of museum, library, archive, and historical property security and related matters. The bib- liographies will be submitted to A.S.I.S. headquarters and dunng the next 24 months a comprehensive document will be prepared and made available to our interested members. Additionally, we wish to compile copies of all unpub- lished papers and other documents relating to our mutual interests and, with the permission of the authors, place copies in the A.S.I.S. Library for our members' use. Also to be undertaken by our Publications Subcom- mittee will be a project to determine the feasibility of preparing a series of mini-manuals on various topics deal- ing with museum, library, archive, and historical prop- erty security. These manuals will be submitted for publication by A.S.I.S. National Headquarters with full credit to the authors. Ultimately, these could be incor- porated into a definitive book on the topic of security for cultural institutions. I am also establishing a legislative subcommittee whose job it will be to research the various state and federal laws and international treaties and agreements in order to compile for our members a complete listing and summary of laws relating to the transfer of ownership of pillaged and stolen objects. The subcommittee would also monitor pending legislation through readily available sources, to insure that any legislation enacted is in the best interests of our members. We are interested in the preservation of archaeological sites just as we are in the theft of paintings and other material objects. When we find a way to take the profit out of the theft of art and antiquities, we will be better able to control the problem. For now, we are in the preliminary stages of our proj- ects. Any JFA readers who know of useful bibliogra- phies, etc., could be of great service by forwarding them to me. Opinions on how to solve the problems that we all face would also be welcome. STEVEN R. KELLER, DIRECTOR Department of Protection Services The Art Institute of Chicago Michigan Ave. at Adams St. Chicago, IL 60606</page><page sequence="10">Letter from Washington Ellen Herscher 522 The Antiquities MarkerlVitelli make a brief statement and ask a few questions, but did not stay until the conclusion. No other senators attended. It was somewhat surprising to find the dealers once again testifying against UNESCO legislation, because the text of S. 1723 is identical to a compromise version of H.R. 3403, the result of discussions among the interested parties in 1980, to which the dealers' representatives ostensibly agreed at that time. It is now obvious, how- ever, from their appearance at the hearings and from the Mitgang column (see below), that they will continue to oppose in any way possible any attempt, no matter how moderate, to regulate their activities. On the other hand, Senator Moynihan, who has previously championed their position, seems to have taken a more conciliatory stance on this particular bill. While raising objections to the UNESCO Convention on the same grounds that he has expressed in the past,2 he stressed that S. 1723 is a con- siderable improvement over its predecessors. It is significant that both the art dealers and Senator Moynihan used the hearings on S. 1723 to express their outrage at the other means (bilateral treaties and the Na- tional Stolen Property Act) now being effectively used to recover antiquities.3 Those comments, of course, are entirely beside the point or, if anything, would seem to argue in support of prompt passage of the implementing legislation. Certainly the provisions of S. 1723 are much more restricted than the other measures now being applied. Finally, the fact that these hearings were held at all is a tribute to the unflagging efforts of the supporters of the UNESCO Convention. Early last spring it seemed highly unlikely that any action at all would be taken on S. 1723, as there was no interest in it among the Senators and Finance Committee staff. The bill is now moving only because of the many letters they received in late spring and early summer, which demonstrated that there are many people in this country who do care about the pro- tection of antiquities. I would like personally to thank all AFFA members whose letters helped in this effort: after so many years, it is easy to be discouraged, but you can be sure that your letters DO make a difference. The following sections include some of the highlights of the hearings and a few relevant letters. 2. For a summary of the 1978 Senate Hearings on the CPIA see JFA 5 (1978) 98-100. 3. Editor's note. It is worth noting that during the 1978 hearings the dealers actually argued that the CPIA was unnecessary because stolen property was already covered by existing laws (JFA 5 [1978] 99). Now that those existing laws are being applied effectively to some cases involving the smuggling of antiquities, they would like to do away with those laws as well. LATE NEWS S. 1723 was reported out of committee without opposition on September 15. It is very likely that it will be passed by the Senate this session and that it will pass the House as well. The number of the House bill has not yet been assigned, but please write your Congressman urging that it be pushed through this session. Clemency Coggins August 15, 1982 Senate Holds Hearings on Cultural Property Implementation Act Hearings were held on the Cultural Property Imple- mentation Act, S. 1723, on July 22, before the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade. As only one of a group of 20 bills being considered at two days of hearings, time spent on this issue was necessarily limited. Testimony was restricted to one oral witness each in support and in opposition. Representa- tives of the State Department and Customs Service also made brief statements and responded to questions. R.E.W. Adams, President of the Society for American Archaeology, spoke on behalf of a coalition of archae- ological, art historical, museological, and preservation groups.l He was accompanied by Clemency Coggins (AIA) and Mary Elizabeth King (AFFA). Douglas C. Ewing, President of the American Association of Dealers in Ancient, Oriental, and Primitive Art, accompanied by his lawyer James Fitzpatrick and by Peter Marks, spoke for his group. Senator Danforth, the chairrnan of the Subcommittee was not present for this portion of the hearing, and Senator Matsunaga, the sponsor of the bill, presided.

We cannot expect other nations to aid in the control of such traffic if we do not offer them a quid pro quo. The US is probably the largest market in the world for antiquities, and, as such, has an obligation to lead in the control of the illegal traffic in artifacts. We can exercise such leadership by implementing the UNESCO Convention of 1970. Other signatories of the Convention would be positively influenced to similar action if the United States is willing to take this important step. This bill represents compromise among the various interests, scientific and cultural on the part of the arche- ologists, museum officials, and art historians, and com- mercial on the part of the art dealers. The art dealers' interests are served by, among other things, requiring that the President essentially determine that there is a crisis in a certain country in the looting of its antiquities and that the country of origin has implemented its own laws controlling the export of antiquities, before placing US import restrictions on those items. In addition to the favorable benefits for foreign nations and for US foreign relations, S. 1723 would have a significant scientific benefit as well. Archeologists do not benefit financially from archeological excavation, or from this legislation, except in the sense that we can raise research funds for sites that are still intact. Many sites have been looted in my area alone, the Maya lowlands, since 1970, the date of passage of the UNESCO Convention. The cave with murals in Guatemala, recently described in National Geographic magazine, is an example. Looters hit that site immediately after it was known; the lack of a market for such items and the existence of laws restricting the movement of these antiquities might have avoided this depredation. Finally, the American public benefits from exhibits such as "The Search for Alexander" in which some of the magnificent material from the tomb of Philip the Second was displayed. This legislation provides for the encouragement of such cultural interchanges. Again, had looters hit the site of Philip's tomb, we might not have had the opportunity to see this material collected under a single roof. Indeed, had this material been distributed among private collections by looters, we would likely not have even known that it was, in fact, from Philip's tomb! A ceramic from an archeologically recorded tomb can tell us a great deal about ancient cultures and about ourselves; an ancient pot sitting on an art dealer's shelf is just another pretty vase. Thank you very much. Prepared Testimony of Douglas C. Ewing I am Douglas C. Ewing. I represent and am President Prepared Testimony of Dr. Richard E. W. Adams in Support of S. 1723 July 22, 1982 Gentlemen: My name is Richard E. W. Adams and I appear before you as the President of the Society for American Ar- chaeology. I am also a past member of the Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association, and represent here today a coalition of organizations (see note 1). My formal position is that of Professor of Anthropol- ogy at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and I have been a field archeologist working with the ancient civilizations of Mexico and Central America for some 25 years. Past cultures and civilizations and ethnographic cul- tures are part of the universal heritage of mankind. The archeological and academic groups which I represent may number less than 100,000, but we are the professional expression of an interest which engages millions of peo- ple and which bridges cultural and political boundaries. That cultural heritage is in grave danger through pillaging of archeological sites on a worldwide basis for commer- cially valuable material to sell in the art markets of this country among others. The legislation you are consid- ering, Senate bill 1723, is another of a series of efforts to implement a set of protective laws which will begin to cope with this problem. The legislation is nothing new, for it follows through on a unanimous advise and consent by the Senate in 1972 on the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Archeological sites and cultural information destroyed for gain probably cause real anguish only among profes- sional archeologists and a few officials of the govern- ments concerned. The results and unnoticed impacts, however, are much broader. For many developing na- tions, there is a problem of building an identity, and part of that identity is involved in their native cultural past. If that past cannot be recovered because of the damage to the archeological resources of a country, then some- thing irretrievable and valuable has been lost. A parallel for us would be if Williamsburg had been looted to serve a market in 17th and 18th century artifacts, and not enough had remained to permit the meticulous excavation and restoration that one sees there today. To fully un- derstand the meaning of an artifact requires that you must know the context: whether it occurs in a tomb, a kitchen, or even more unlikely places. The United States is one of the largest markets for illegally excavated and exported materials. That is la- mentable in itself. However, much of the US public does</page><page sequence="12">524 The Antiquities MarketlVitelli of the American Association of Dealers in Ancient, Oriental, and Primitive Art. The Association comprises dealers in a wide range of art classical Greek and Ro- man, ancient Near Eastern, the arts of China, Japan, India and Southeast Asia, pre-Colombian art, and pri- mitive art from Africa, the Pacific Basin and North America. We are pleased to respond to your invitation to testify on S. 1723, a bill to implement the UNESCO treaty on international movement of cultural property. The Association has been involved for many years in commenting upon this highly controversial legislation which was initially developed by the State Department to implement the 1972 UNESCO treaty. Hearings have been held on predecessor bills in the House in 1977 and 1979, and in the Senate in 1978. This legislation has undergone a number of redrafts in an attempt to meet the many serious criticisms that have been advanced in the hearings. The central concern of the Association over the years has been the failure of the proposed legislation to provide that the United States would participate in a concerted international efffiort to respond to any problems in the trade and movement of cultural properties. We have em- phatically stated that unilateral action on the part of the United States would not in any meaningful way respond to the problems of the concerned foreign countries; rather, the traffic in cultural properties would simply be deflected from the United States to other major art importing nations. Thus, we were pleased that the most recent draft of the legislation, S . 1723, has incorporated the requirement of a concerted international response as a touchstone of any U.S. participation in such international plans. Nevertheless, there are still severe shortcomings with the present draft of this bill which do not afford a fair and equitable response for our citizens to the problems of the movement of cultural goods in international com- merce. Senate Bill 1723, while an improvement over previous bills, requires substantial changes to assure that it will be fairly and reasonably applied. The bill is vir- tually identical to Discussion Draft No. 1 of the House Committee on Ways and Means, printed February 27, 1980. Although the bill makes several desirable changes from earlier versions, it unfortunately does not take into account the constructive dialogue which the Discussion Draft elicited. Nor does it satisfactorily resolve some of the basic issues which had led to the severe and thoughtful criticism of predecessor bills by respected museum of- ficials across the country, distinguished collectors, and responsible art dealers. Thus, the remarks of Senator Matsunaga introducing this new bill, suggesting that it meets "the approval of the affected groups," Cong. Rec. 11286, October 7, 1981, simply overstates the degree of consensus and fails to reflect the deep concern of many affected parties. The salutory principle of S. 1723, to discourage illicit pillaging and destruction of the world's artistic patri- mony, can be achieved without penalizing responsible art dealers and collectors by inadvertently blocking im- portation into the United States of broad classes of works of art which have not been "pillaged," ''looted," or " stolen. " This testimony highlights significant matters of prin- ciple which remain unresolved and suggests a number of drafting changes to eliminate unnecessary ambiguities in the bill. Comprehensive hearings which can focus on these and related matters are essential to a reasoned anal- ysis of this bill. The current two-day hearings, announced less than two weeks ago, and during which S. 1723 is being considered along with over 20 other bills, is in our view completely inadequate. Indeed, many interested persons and organizations in the art world, even those who have actively participated in the past, have not been apprised of these truncated hearings. Additional hearings are necessary.4 A. Key Provisions of S. 1723 In the Appendix to this testimony,S we set forth our specific concerns with the new bill, including concrete suggestions for changes. The major points addressed in detail in the Appendix include the following: The "concerted international effort" principle as set forth in the bill requires greater clarity to be workable. A variety of provisions must be strengthened to as- sure that the requirement for a concerted international effort cannot be sidestepped. The emergency restnctions must be limited to avoid emasculation of the remainder of the bill. Documentation requirements must be further ration- alized to reduce potentially mischievous and unreview- able bureaucratic authority. B. Stolen Cultural Property: Section 7 In addition to the concerns discussed in the Appendix, the Association is particularly troubled by S. 1723's treatment of "stolen" property. We have two principal concerns. 4. Editor's note. The bill has only been under discussion for 10 years! 5. Editor's note. Space restrictions prohibit the publication here of the full Appendix submitted with Mr. Ewing's testimony. It will be avail- able in the written proceedings of the Hearing, available from the Senate Subcommittee.</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 9, 1982 525 First, certain types of cultural property which are ''stolen" may never be imported into the United States, whether or not there is a concerted international effort or the invocation of emergency restrictions. While there can be no reasonable objection to the principle underlying this provision, the actual language of the provision will result in unnecessary confusion and unintended harshness in its administration. First, the type of cultural property at issue need only be said to ''appertain" to the inventory of a museum or similar institution. Under this bill, a more manageable standard is necessary for a provision with such extraordinary consequences. The standard should be modified to include only property which is ''docu- mented as appertaining" to the relevant institutions' in- ventory. This revised standard should be added to page 19, line 20, and a similar change must be made on page 24, line 1. The second problem with Section 7 relates to the un- defined term ''stolen." Current practices of the Depart- ment of State and the Customs Service, as will be discussed toward the end of this testimony, indicate that Section 7 is likely to be abused in its present form. The problem results from an ambiguous decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States v. McClain, 545 F.2d 988 (1977). That case, interpreting the National Stolen Property Act, involved a most narrow factual circumstance where the evidence demonstrated that the parties involved had the clearest knowledge of foreign laws and a specific intent to traffic in properties in violation of those laws. Unfortunately, the decision is now being expanded to serve as a broad platform for invoking the civil and criminal process of the United States to bar and deter importation of cultural properties totally apart from the long established principles of com- mon law theft. The decision in McClain permits an inter- pretation that one can be convicted of transporting and receiving ''stolen" property under the National Stolen Property Act without proof that an object was ''stolen" in any common law sense; rather, it may be considered to be "stolen" simply because a foreign law asserts that any goods of a particular category or source are the prop- erty of the government in question. This mischievous interpretation should not be engrafted into Senate Bill 1723. In order to reconcile the perverse notion of ''stolen" permitted by McClain with that which has evolved over the years in common law, we propose an amendment to Section 7 to clarify legislative intent. The amendment should be added at page 20, line 2: The provisions of the National Stolen Property Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2315, shall apply to any cultural prop- erty stolen from such institutions and transported or sold or received in this country as prohibited by the Act, provided however, that no property shall be considered as stolen, converted or taken by fraud within the meaning of section 2314, or stolen, unlawfully converted or taken within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2315, where the alleged act of stealing, conversion or taking is based upon a taking away of such property from a foreign government or country and the claim of ownership of such property by the foreign gov- ernment or country is based solely upon a declaration of national ownership, without such property having been re- duced to possession by such foreign government or country.6 C. Abuse of Existing Executive Authority Beyond the issues concerning the specific language and policies of S. 1723, there is a need for the Congress to consider most carefully the efforts of certain executive agencies and departments to develop policies in this area which are far beyond present statutory authority and, in many instances, inconsistent with the provisions of this bill. For example, the Customs Service has recently em- barked on a systematic program of attempting to enforce foreign laws dealing with ownership of cultural properties in circumstances where U.S. law poses no bar to their importation. This highly controversial initiative by the Customs Service which has been admitted by govern- ment officials to be a policy in which Customs is ''wing- ing it" has been strongly criticized editorially in The Washington Post, a paper normally sympathetic to the concerns reflected in the legislation. Most critically, this action is totally inconsistent with the guiding principle of S. 1723. It is not part of a con- certed international response. Rather, it is unilateral; and even worse, it is lawless, literally, because it exceeds Customs' authority under its organic statutes. Earlier this year Senator Moynihan sought informal comment from the Customs Service on this very issue. A copy of his letter, dated April 21, 1982 is attached as Exhibit C, along with the Customs Service response, dated June 10, 1982, as Exhibit D [see below]. The Service incredu- lously states that the importation of art claimed to be owned by foreign countries is no different than the im- portation of a stolen motorcycle. The analogy is com- pletely unfair under the Customs Service current enforcement policies. The real issue, unmet by the anal- ogy, is what force the United States should give to another country's announcement that antiquities found within its borders belong to it no matter how long individuals within 6. Editor's note. This proposed amendment would, of course, com- pletely eliminate any protection for as yet unexcavated archaeological objects, which can hardly be ;;possessed" before they have even been discovered.</page><page sequence="14">526 The Antiquities MarketlVitelli the country possessed or traded them, and no matter that persons in the country can still own them. The Customs Service makes importation of such antiquities sound like ordinary theft from a common law possessor. That is exactly what the standard should be, but it is not the current enforcement policy of the Customs Service. Any hearings convened on S. 1723 should look care- fully into the Customs Service's actions which clearly, in our view, exceed existing statutory authority and quite improperly anticipate and preempt the views that Con- gress might have on the proper national response to this issue. It is also important for the Committee to review recent actions of the State Department which seem to lend the authority of the United States to enforce foreign laws dealing with ownership of cultural properties, where, once again, there are no U.S. statutes prohibiting the importation of such goods. The Association will, of course, be happy to continue to cooperate with the Congress in any way that it can to help assure that any legislation offered to implement the UNESCO Convention adequately balances all competing interests. We believe strongly that additional hearings are criticial to explore the serious issues which continue to divide the art community in connection with this legis- lation. The new hearings should also explore the recent actions of the Customs Service in arrogating legislative authority to itself and in misapplying the McClain . . c .eclslon. Exhibit C Mr. William von Raab April 21, 1982 Commissioner United States Customs Service 1301 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington DC 20229 Dear Mr. von Raab: I have become concerned with reports that the Customs Service has initiated a new program of seizing and de- taining imports of archeological and ethnological artifacts on the grounds that the country of origin has a law de- claring their national ownership. This new initiative would appear to exceed the Service's present statutory authority. Indeed press reports indicate that lawyers at Customs acknowledge that this program is on question- able statutory grounds. Beyond that, this new program may have the effect of preempting Congressional efforts to establish policy in the area. I believe consideration should be given to abandoning the program pending de- finitive Congressional resolution of this matter. A guiding principle of interest, at least in the Senate deliberations on this question of policy, has been the degree to which the United States unilaterally should bar or discourage the importation of the artistic patrimony of other countries. As you know, Congress has been directly involved in seeking to resolve this issue since the Senate gave its advice and consent to the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property in 1972. We have had extensive hearings in the Senate on legislation to imple- ment the Convention. Until this session of Congress, the bills introduced to implement the Convention had rejected the Conventions' underlying principle that a nation's import restrictions on cultural property should be made only as part of a ''concerted international effort." Each of the past bills would have permitted the Executive Branch unilaterally to impose import restrictions. None was enacted into law. Senators Matsunaga and Baucus have now introduced implementing legislation that accepts the Conventions' standard of a concerted international effort, and by doing so their bill, S. 1723, greatly improves the prior versions. This latest bill would also permit limited unilateral emer- gency import controls and would bar the importation of certain "stolen'' cultural property. But the bill has not yet been passed; nor in fact have hearings yet been held. It is especially troubling under these circumstances that the Customs Service has apparently exercised the au- thority which, until now, Congress chose not to confer. I would appreciate learning whether you intend, pend- ing a Congressional decision, on this matter to suspend this new program. I would also appreciate learning of the steps you have taken to establish and enforce the program and the specific statutory basis of this program. Sincerely, Daniel Patrick Moynihan Exhibit D The Ionorable Daniel P. Moynihan United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 June 10, 1982 Dear Senator Moynihan: This is in response to your letter dated April 21, 1982, expressing concern ''with reports that the Customs Serv- ice has initiated a new program of seizing and detaining importations of archeological and ethnological artifacts on the grounds that the country of origin has a law de- claring their national ownership." Your letter says that consideration should be given to abandoning the program pending definitive congressional resolution of this matter. We believe that some of your concem may be based</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 9, 1982 527 on misunderstanding. Perhaps it would be beneficial therefore, to outline our actual activities in this area and the statutory or other basis upon which they are based. We believe that this review will show that the Customs Service has not initiated a new program and that its ex- isting programs are consistent with Customs laws and our international obligations. It has, to my knowledge, always been the policy of the United States to assist foreign countries in recovering stolen property, particularly art objects. In this regard, the Customs Service, working with the State Department and other law enforcement agencies, has in the past as- sisted foreign governments in recovering religious statues stolen from ancient temples (India), Italian masters paint- ings (stolen from Italy and Germany), German postage stamps (stolen during World War II) and various Pre- Columbian artifacts (stolen from museums and archeo- logical excavation in Central and South America). Recently a great deal of attention has been given in the press to seizures and detentions by the Customs Service of Pre-Columbian art and artifacts from Peru. Some of the press stories involved interviews with importers and dealers or their attorneys who misstated Customs in- volvement or position, possibly because they were seek- ing to have criminal prosecutions discontinued. For example, a New York Times article (September 2, 1981 ) concerning the so called ''Bernstein" seizure at Dulles Airport gave the impression that Customs was using the seizure to establish precedent. This article appeared on page 1. When it was brought to the attention of the paper that the case involved traditional undervaluation and misdescription of imported articles, and would have been vigorously pursued regardless of the commodity in- volved, the paper printed a correction (albeit in the second section) of the September 3, 1981, edition. Mr. Seidel, our Assistant Chief Counsel and one of the Customs officials ''quoted" in the Times articles, assures me that Customs is not on "shaky legal grounds" in seizures such as Mr. Bernstein's. (In fact, Mr. Bernstein has been convicted and sentenced.) Much of the Pre-Columbian art and artifacts being imported into the United States is being misdeclared and undervalued for Customs purposes. As you can imagine, it is difficult for Customs officers to determine the coun- try of origin and the exact status of many of the articles. In an effort to determine the true description and value of the items, Customs frequently calls on the opinion of experts in the field. It is at that time that the Customs officers may learn of the specific nature of the articles and of the foreign ownership claims and the possible restrictions and prohibition on exporting and importing. These articles fall into several categories. 1. Pre-Columbian Monumental or Architectural Sculp- ture or Murals Under 19 U.S.C. 2091-2095 (P.L. 92-587) it is illegal to import into the United States articles covered by this statute without a certificate from the country of origin or proof that it was exported prior to the effective date of the regulations or that it is not subject to the Act. Customs may detain the item for 90 days or more pending the determination as to the article's admissibility into the United States. If the item falls within the act the seizure and forfeiture proceedings are commenced. 2. Pre-Columbian objects not subject to 19 U.S.C. 2091-2095 U. S . Courts have held that the National Stolen Property Act (18 U.S.C. 2314) is violated when objects are im- ported into the United States which are worth $5,000 or more and which have been knowingly removed from a country which has a statute declaring ownership plus a prohibition against exportation of the claimed object. See U.S. v. McClain, 593 F.2d 658 (Sth Cir. 1979). While actual knowledge of the existence of such legislation is probably necessary for criminal prosecution, the object itself would nonetheless belong to the foreign country. The United States presently has a treaty with Mexico (22 UST 494) and an agreement with Peru (signed by the Assistant Secretary of State on September 15, 1981) pro- viding for the recovery and return of stolen archeological, historical and cultural property. Thus, once the United States is aware of the claim of foreign ownership from these countries it would appear that at a minimum it has an obligation to assist the country in recovering the items. It has been the practice of the United States to institute a civil action in the nature of interpleader to allow the courts to determine ownership. In this respect, the im- portation of art and artifacts is no different than the im- portation of a stolen motorcycle or auto where a foreign country reports it stolen and it turns up at a port being imported by an innocent purchaser. To date, the Customs Service has only used the interpleader action in two cases involving artifacts. Both involve artifacts from Peru which has had a law since 1929 vesting title in unex- cavated artifacts in the Government of Peru. Peru has been vigorously prosecuting artifact cases in recent years and sought United States assistance since the majority of buyers are in the United States. In summary, the United States Customs Service has only been seizing artifacts where it is clear that it is prohibited under U.S. law, misdeclared or undervalued under U.S. law, or where knowledge on the part of the owner (the McClain situation) can be shown. When these situations are not present it has been the practice of the United States to only detain those items which may be</page><page sequence="16">528 The Antiquities Market/Vitelli covered by an international treaty or agreement and it appears that the item clearly falls within the purview of a foreign claim or ownership. During such detention, if it is determined that the item is not subject to treaty or agreement but claimed by a foreign country from which it was exported, it has been our practice not to release the item until ownership is established (by interpleader or other judicial action). In other cases, such as exports from a third country or where the law is not clear, Cus- toms may notify the country claiming ownership so that it can pursue its claims in court. In such cases, Customs will not detain the shipment. The Customs Service does not and will not enforce foreign export restrictions in the absence of a United States statute. Iowever, where there is a claim of own- ership and a treaty or agreement the Customs Service believes that it has an obligation to assist in returning the item to its rightful owner. The Customs Service believes that the proposed UNESCO legislation would certainly clarify the law in certain cases. Iowever, the UNESCO treaty would not supersede bilateral agreements. These agreements have fostered international cooperation, not only in the art arena, but also in other areas. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to express our views in this matter. Yours faithfully, Alfred R. De Angelug Acting Commissioner of Customs Statement of the Honorable Daniel Patrick MoynihanS United States Senator from the State of New York Senator Moynihan. Mr. Chairman, just in the briefest terms, as I think you know my views on the matter. I know the panel does. There is a particularly painful conflict in our own in- terests and feelings and beliefs on this subject. The United States has been very much in the advanced guard of those faced with probation through public institutions. Mu- seums, for example, have been meticulous about this subject of stolen loot and foreign artifacts. The Smithsonian Institution has established guidelines which are strictly upheld. I know at one point when the Roman and Greek coins were stolen from the Fogg mu- seum at Iarvard University, and in a small gesture to try to do something about this this occurred in India where I was then Ambassador I offered a small but not in- significant collection of Alexandrine tetradachms which I had in my possession, to the museum. And the museum, to my eternal gratitude, turned them down because I could not explain their provenience. As a consequence, it is the only piece of negotiable property I have left to bury myself and my wife. Absent that, it would be a pauper's grave or Arlington Cemetery. I didn't say then but I say now, they wanted to know where did I get them. I bought them from an Armenian coin dealer in Istanbul. And where did he get them? He got them, probably six or seven removes, from a group of people who had dug them up in Syria. There were three people; they split the hoard three ways, two of which have ended up in Geneva, the other is here. They were historically important, because they are about 15 different mints of the same coin. And the museum couldn't take them under a reason which seemed to me odd, because if the museum didn't get them somebody else would will eventually. And they were bought in an open market in an open way. When workmen discover hoards, which is frequently the case, they take them to the market. The largest gold collection of pre-Christian Ireland was discovered by men digging a railway tunnel in the 1850s. They melted half of it down and sold it as bullion before somebody noticed these fellows had an awful lot of money they ordinarily didn't have, and the rest is priceless. We don't want to discourage things coming to the market, because they end up with people who care very much about them. Our dealers are immensely responsi- ble, also. They don't deal in stolen goods; they deal in goods that come on the market. In this UNESCO legislation I will say simply: As in so many matters, the countries of UNESCO choose to ascribe their own shortcomings to the depredation of the West. And to allude to UNESCO as the standard against which we must measure ourselves is a perilous enterprise. They have already decided that the free press is a capi- talist, imperialist conspiracy, and that is just their begin- ning. The next thing, we will find that we have to follow a UNESCO convention that says abolish the First Amend- ment because it simply gives the power over public opinion to rich and depraved people. And that is the language they talk over there. They talk about our dealers who actually have been superb preservers of the past that is easily lost. * * * Richard Abby (Chief Counsel, Customs Service): Mr. Ewing's statement is not truly representative of what, in fact, the Customs policy has been. * * * Ely Maurer (Assistant Legal Advisor, [)epartment of State): The last time implementing legislation was con- sidered, in the Iouse Ways and Means committee (1979-80), we thought we had arrived at ''a consensus of views," except in regard to the evidentiary require-</page><page sequence="17">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 9, 1982 529 ments. The Administration's letter supporting S. 1723 suggests compromise wording on this issue. * * * Senator Moynihan. Well, yes. I would like to thank them all and say that I believe we have made very con- siderable progress in the last few years since the time when this first came up. I have sort of three sets of questions. If I can first say, I don't want to be constantly asserting my bona fides in this matter, but I think I share the concerns of the whole range of you here. I am Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Hirshorn Museum. We have been dealing with this problem at some length. We adhere very strictly to the Smithsonian standard. I must tell you that we have written at least one foreign government to say, "We have a large number of your artifacts that perhaps may have been stolen. Do you want them back?" And we have yet to hear from the foreign governments. In two years time we have not had an answer or a letter. My wife is an archeologist, a member of the board of ASOR, and is much involved in the concerns that the archeological community has, which are entirely legiti- mate, which is that if archeology is seen as a form of looting, certainly access to the sites will disappear [sic !] . It has already diminished, as I'm sure [)r. Adams would agree. I have three questions in a row. First of all, who can tell me what is the state of European and Oriental com- pliance with the treaty? Asked specifically whether Switzerland, Germany, France, Britain, and Japan have signed, Mr. Maurer answered ''no" to each, but was not permitted time for any explanatory remarks. Senator Moynihan then asked Mr. Abby how the pres- ent Customs practice diffiers from that attributed to it by the dealers, but did not allow time for a response. The senator continued by criticizing the laws of other coun- tries in regard to art export as support for his view that these laws are often foolish and arbitrary, and thus we ought not to enforce them. Speaking from his experience as Ambassador to India, Senator Moynihan added: ''anything Hindu that leaves this country is stolen; any- thing Islamic is well got rid of; and anything Christian is for the asking. On Buddhism they were also very protective. ' ' Mr. Fitzpatrick conceded that the bill was a ''consid- erable improvement'' over its predecessors, but said that the dealers still had ''reservations'' which are ''largely tune-up and technical concerns.'' These mainly consist of the need for specific standards for the requisite multi- national response, and that the present bill grants too much emergency power to the President (emergency measures could be imposed for a total of eight years). Mr. Fitzpatrick. We have a series of additional sug- gestions that we think are impc,rtant that the Committee consider, and in the past we have been anxious and it has been productive for us to meet with the other affected parties with the Subcommittee counsel and try to work those things through. We would be happy to do that again. Senator Matsunaga. I thought 1723 was the result of a compromise reached by those involved. Is this not so? Mr. Fitzpatrick. It is not so. It was a compromise reached on the part of the people on this side of the table, and I must say it did reflect discussions that were im- portant and significant in terms of the concerted inter- national response. We would not be here saying that we have concerns about these technical matters if those were not residual problems that we had. But we were not asked before the most recent bill, 1723, was introduced as to whether we had signed off on the bill. I must say our concerns are not of the dimension in this area that they have been in the past. There has been significant movement. But there never has been any re- quest to us or any assurances from our side of the table that we were signing off on the bill. Clemency Coggins, in response to Senator Moynihan' s questions about European actions, reported on her trip to France and England in November, 1981, as a rep- resentative of the AIA. In both countries she found active concern with the UNESCO Convention, and strong in- terest in the efforts being made in the U.S. Senator Moynihan. We are on the side of all of you here. But your interests are not entirely the same, and our nation has the right to protect itself against other nations who would like to see us do what they won't do. I would love to see a room full of the 24 members of the OECD, each with an ambassador, pen-in-hand, simul- taneously signing the UNESCO treaty. It's not a bad idea. After Senator Moynihan left, there was some further discussion for the record concerning the need for leg- islation and the suitability of the present bill. During this period, the dealers' representatives emphasized their desire to narrow the definition of ''stolen'' as used in the bill, in order to avoid its broad application as in the McClain decision: "common law concepts should govern.''</page><page sequence="18">530 The Antiquities MarketlVitelli In these hearings, the dealers did not attempt in any significant way to identify their position with the public benefit, an association they had used very effectively in the past. The following statement was submitted for the record in order to address the issue. Throughout the ten years that Cultural Property im- plementation legislation has been considered by Con- gress, most debate has taken the form of a combat between two small special interest groups, much like U.S. rubber producers seeking restrictions against ath- letic shoe importers. The art dealers want their trade to remain unhampered; it may have appeared that the ar- chaeologists want sites to be protected only so that they will have something left to dig up in twenty years. How- ever, Congress needs to consider more fundamental is- sues. Does the United States have any national interest in any of this? Are any benefits to the American public involved, and if so, how can they be attained? The As- sociation for Field Archaeology believes that both U.S. national interest and the public interest are served by S. 1723. The Convention on Cultural Property is intended to reduce the looting of archaeological sites. It follows the principle of supply and demand: if the demand for ille- gally-acquired antiquities is reduced, the looting which supplies that demand will diminish. Looting destroys archaeological sites, and with them disappears the knowledge which could have been gained from careful excavation. Recent popular accounts of scientific ar- chaeology, such as Martin's Hundred, many National Geographic articles, and the Odyssey television series, show what can be learned about man's past when ex- cavation is more than the mere seizing of aesthetically- pleasing objects. All civilized nations hold the principle that the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge benefits mankind as a whole. All civilized people deplore the destruction of knowledge. Thus a moral obligation re- quires that some action be taken to combat the ravishment of this irreplaceable cultural resource. But does the U.S. have anything to gain from this principled moral posture, or, as this bill's critics have claimed, does it have everything to lose? Full partici- pation in the Convention would immediately be a sig- nificant factor in improving our relations with many countries whose cultural patrimony is being destroyed by theft and smuggling. The loss of such material is a blow greatly exceeding its monetary value: it represents na- tional identity and pride, symbolizing a past often more glorious than these nations' developing status today. Our cooperation in Peru's recent attempts to regain artifacts taken illegally has warrned our relationships with that country in much wider spheres. The actual text of the Convention is a rare example of what may be considered a U.S. ''victory" in UNESCO. The original draft, much broader and more sweeping, which was supported by the Soviet bloc and many third world countries, was rejected by the Conference in favor of the present one, which is essentially a U.S.-drafted agreement. Certainly the U.S. has long recognized the necessity of international cooperation in dealing with some internal problems, as witnessed by our approach to narcotics enforcement. But will the American public be deprived of its ability to own and see cultural artifacts if this legislation is passed? On the contrary. First of all, S. 1723 will not affect the legal trade in antiquities: individuals and in- stitutions with the money to buy them will still be able to purchase properly documented objects on the open market. In fact, such buyers will be better protected by the clear title and authenticity assured by the trading procedures required by the legislation. The vast majority of the American people, however, must depend on museums and other public institutions for its access to ancient artifacts. Such opportunities will be increased by the passage of S. 1723. As Senator Moy- nihan has observed, most U.S. museums today already have policies prohibiting the purchase or acceptance of illicitly acquired objects, so the material affected by the Convention would not be going to museums anyway. Moreover, the economic realities of today dictate that most cultural institutions cannot make numerous and large-scale purchases of any kind. Much more important to the public's enjoyment are the large loan exhibitions, often sponsored by private enterprise, which have become more frequent in recent years. An exhibit such as ''The Treasures of Tutankha- mun" contained more objects than could ever be pur- chased by one museum, and was seen by more Americans because it traveled to several U.S. cities. The great pop- ularity of this show also attests to the importance of archaeological context: Egyptian tombs have been looted for more than three thousand years and U.S. museums contain thousands of objects from this source. But the Tutankhamun exhibit attracted much more interest be- cause it was known where all the things came from and to whom they belonged. These artifacts spoke to us of a living human being. S. 1723 specifically encourages such loan exhibits and other forms of cultural exchange. In fact, it provides important leverage for the President to use to elicit exchange with countries that have been reluctant to participate in the past. Recent developments such as the McClain decision and the bilateral treaties with Mexico and Peru represent a demand for some action to slow the wholesale destruction of these cultural resources. Congress should not delay</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 9, 1982 531 any longer passing into law the moderate and fair mea- sures represented by S. 1723. Submitted by Dr. Ellen Herscher Chair, Committee on Public Action The Association for Field Archaeology There are likely to be further discussions on specific points of S. 1723 before mark-up takes place. The Ar- chaeological Institute of America's Legislative Alert Sys- tem has been activated to solicit more letters urging passage of the bill during the current session of Congress. It is just possible that by the time these pages reach your mailbox the Cultural Property Implementation Act may have been passed. Historic Shipwreck Legislation The week before the Senate held hearings on the Cul- tural Property Implementation Act, the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Subcommittee on Oceanography, held hearings on another bill of great importance to archaeology. Congressman Norrnan E. D'Amours, Chairman of the Subcommittee opened the hearings as follows. Congressman D'Amours. The Subcommittee meets today, July 15, 1982, to receive testimony on H.R. 132, a Bill which would give the United States title to all abandoned historic shipwrecks located on the outer con- tinental shelf or under navigable waters within state boundaries. This bill responds to a perceived need for federal protection of these culturally valuable and non- renewable resources. The great monetary and historical value of some wrecks has created a conflict between federal and state govern- ments on one side, and private salvors on the other. This conflict over ownership of these vessels and their cargos is characterized by a long and continuing history of lit- igation. In Florida's federal courts, salvors have suc- cessfully asserted their right under Admiralty Law to search for and take possession of abandoned property recovered at sea. Efforts to demonstrate federal or state statutory limitations on these salvage rights have been rejected by the courts. Litigation continues, however, and the ownership debate remains open. This Bill represents an effort to settle the question of shipwreck ownership while providing a framework for the protection of the shipwrecks and their cargoes. I sin- cerely hope a clearer understanding of the abandoned historic shipwreck situation and the course of further Subcommittee action will result from testimony received today. Wilburn A. Cockrell, Administrator of the Underwater Section of the Bureau of Historic Sites and Properties, State of Florida, gave testimony for the archaeological community. Jerry L. Rogers, Associate Director, Ar- chaeology and Historic Preservation, National Park Service, Department of the Interior; Theodore G. Kron- miller, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Oceans and Fisheries Affairs, Department of State; Mel Fisher, Treasure Salvors, Inc.; and Deb Whitcraft, Professional Diver, were the other witnesses.7 Although there will almost certainly be no further ac- tion on the bill in this Congress, we may expect a revised version of the bill to be considered next year. The next issue of the "Antiquities Market" will include a full presentation of this proposed legislation. Peruvian Antiquities: the Bernstein Case and Others The Peruvian Embassy in Washington staged a glit- tering finale to the Bernstein case on August 5. The event marked the forrnal return of the approximately 700 Pre- Columbian artifacts, valued at $1.5 million, which had been found in the possession of importer David Bernstein and were determined by U.S. courts to be the property of the Peruvian government (JFA 9:2 [1982] 276-277). U.S. government officials attending the reception in- cluded Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Enders; Assistant Secretary of the Trea- sury John Walker, Jr.; and Commissioner of Customs William von Raab. Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Fernando Schwalb, accepted the objects on behalf of Peru and announced the formation of a non- profit foundation in the U.S. to assist Peru in constructing a new archaeological and anthropological museum. Par- ticular honors at the ceremony were given to U.S. Cus- toms special agent Richard Conger, who intercepted at Dulles airport the shipment that opened the case; to at- torneys for the Peruvian government, Frederick Truslow and Eugene Propper, and to Dr. Clifford Evans, the Smithsonian curator, who died of a heart attack shortly after inspecting the detained shipment. A small selection of the recovered material was on display during the pre- sentation; a complete exhibit is expected at the National Geographic Society and the other U.S. museums before the artifacts are actually sent back to Peru. The ceremony attracted considerable attention from the print and broadcast media, most of it sympathetic to the 7. Information on H.R. 132 was provided by W.A. Cockrell.</page><page sequence="20">The Antiquities Market is a regular feature of the Journal of Field Archaeology.

An unfortunate exception was a col- umn by Herbert Mitgang which appeared in the New York Times on August 5 (''Recovered Peruvian Art Raises Cultural Issues"). Mr. Mitgang's article was a transpar- ent paraphrase of the art dealers' public relations state- ments, and reflected a lack of effort to explore the situation in a substantive way. Meanwhile, David Bernstein paid a $1000 fine and is now performing his 200 hours of "community service" while on probation (his one-year jail sentence was sus- pended). He is serving as a consultant on the art and culture of Puerto Rico and Latin America at E1 Museo del Barrio in New York. At the same time, he continues his activities as a dealer, but according to the Mitgang column, he is ''no longer importing art from abroad but acquiring artifacts at auction and from collectors in this country." His new specializations include textiles from Indonesia, Bolivia, and the American Southwest, and American Indian artifacts. This penalty hardly seems to be a severe deterrent to traffickers in millions of dollars worth of antiquities. Peru's new bilateral treaty, however, is achieving some success in the recovery of objects. Two cases in Miami were recently settled under the terms of this agreement, with Peru being awarded title to all the disputed property. In the first, an importer, Daniel Goldfarb, settled out of court when he learned that Peru intended to pursue the case. In the second, Lee Moore, a well-known Miami dealer, agreed to an in-court settlement after two days of argument and returned the Peruvian objects in his possession, including a gold burial mask valued at $50,000. A Guatemalan pot among the seized items, however, was returned to Moore; the government of Guatemala is still seeking its recovery. NEH Sponsors Jefferson Lecture and Symposium In the midst of the day-to-day concerns of the federal budget and pending legislation, I welcomed the change of spending a day considering a larger perspective on archaeology. Each year the National Endowment for the Humanities sponsors a major public lecture in a field of the humanities. This year's lecture, the Eleventh Annual Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, delivered by Emily T. Vermeule on May 5, was entitled; ''Greeks and Bar- barians: The Classical Experience in the Larger World (see JFA 9 [1982] 398). The following day a symposium in conjunction with the lecture was convened on the topic ''American Perspectives on Archaeology." Participants were: Moderator, Machteld Mellink; Panelists, Peter Green, ''Archaeology and the Classical Tradition;" Peter Yon Blanckenhagen, ''Foreign Perspectives on American Archaeology;" Bert Salwen, ''American Archaeology and Historic Preservation;' and Sherman Lee, "Ar- chaeology and the Public". Dr. Vermeule provided a "Reaction" to the other papers; discussion by the invited audience of about 50 people followed. All the participants presented a generally positive view of archaeology's past achievements and its status today, although certain problems of political involvement, pub- lic relations, and funding were noted. Most striking to this observer, however, was a lack of consensus con- cerning the role of archaeology today; each panelist kept his remarks narrowly within the confines of his own spe- cialization. Moreover, several participants seemed to have difficulty in effecting a comfortable coalition of archaeology's humanistic and scientific aspects, a not uncommon problem, but somewhat more disconcerting at this symposium which was intended to consider ar- chaeology as a humanistic discipline. Still it was grat- ifying to see a major federal agency turning its attention to the broader theoretical aspects of archaeology beyond our own national boundaries.
