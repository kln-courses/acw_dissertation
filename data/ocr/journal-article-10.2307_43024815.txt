The fellowship holders would be expected to spend the 1997-98 academic year at SMU, as Research Fellows of the Clements Center. The fellowships are designed to provide time for senior or junior scholars to bring book-length manuscripts to completion. The Research Fellows will each be expected to teach one course during the two-semester duration of the fellowship and participate in Center activities. The Research Fellows will each receive the support of the Center, access to the extraordinary holdings of the DeGolyer Library, and a subvention toward the publication of their books. Each fel- lowship carries a $30,000 stipend and a modest allowance for research and travel expenses. Applicants should send a vita, description of their research project, sample chapter or extract, and three letters of reference from persons who can assess the significance of the proposal and the scholarship record of the proposer. Send applications to David J. Weber, Director, Clements Center for Southwest Studies; Dept. of History - SMU; Dallas, TX 75275. Applications must be received by January 15, 1997. The award will be announced on March 1, 1997.
