Menocal Narciso G. Menocal is a professor of architectural history in the Department of Art History, University of Wisconsin-Madison. He has been a recipient of Buell and Guggenheim Fellowships and has published and lectured widely on Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. His most recent publication is The Tobacco Industry in Cuba and Florida: Its Golden Age in Lithography and Architecture (Miami: Cuban National Heritage, 1995). s is well-known, mature societies are different from one another because of particular historical conditions that some- times act upon them for centuries. Cultural development in post-colonial societies, however, is much more compressed in time than in nations with longstanding traditions. In that accelerated process art becomes useful for discovering intrinsic values, disclos- ing the myths that describe them, and revealing the complex whole that distin- guishes a newly minted society from its mother culture. Cuban art conformed to that pattern from about the mid-1860s to about the mid-1940s, a span of eighty years one may label as its post-colonial period, a term used here in a cultural sense and not in a political one. Painting developed in three stages during that time. First it represented the physical environment, then it devel- oped an imagery around social idiosyncracies, and finally it made evident an abstract concept of nationality. The result was a collective portrait in which Cubans were able to recognize themselves. Two basic themes, the identification of folk characters and the depiction of the physical environment as a poetic entity (principally the landscape), appeared in painting shortly after the mid-nineteenth century, but only after being defined by novelists and poets. As a corollary, an investigation of ways to paint tropical light and its effects on color also ensued. Those nineteenth-century discov- eries were developed further in the twentieth century and became meshed with coopted European avant-garde styles. One result of that cooptation is that modern Cuban painting may appear to some as a peripheral cultural extension of European art. Yet such is not the case. In Europe establishing new defini- tions of form and pictorial space were major concerns, as is evident in Cubism, German Expressionism, or the neue Sachlichkeit- however different from each other these movements may have been and whatever their respective iconographical agendas were. In Cuban art, by contrast, establishing a national imagery through a search for the characteristic and exploring national identity were the major issues. Techniques for representing space and form in modern art, while enthusiastically received, were considered more as tools for establish- ing a corpus of national imagery than as a means for describing a new, abstract universe. Such a corpus would facilitate an assertion of national identity, collec- tively; and it would also help each person to discern how to fit within the broad spectrum of a national culture, individually. Nationalism made Cuban art sui generis in style and general appearance, but perhaps more interestingly, in the manner in which it should be read and interpreted.

Its pur- pose is to show how a major historical process took place. That process entailed the invention of an imagery illustrating the national ethos above and beyond the individual efforts of artists who attempted to create a Cuban aesthetic.2 Cuba was a Spanish colony through 1898. From the sixteenth to the mid- eighteenth century Havana was scarcely more than a fortified port, a protected gathering place for ships laden with goods that would sail back to Spain together as aflota. In spite of those conditions an intellectual life of sorts developed. Poetry was written from the early seventeenth century onward; the Dominican Order founded a university in 1728; the first newspaper was published on 24 October 1790; and a history of Havana, Llave del Nuevo Mundo, written circa 1752-1761 (but not published until 1830), gives evidence that a conscious "Cubanness" was evolving and that its author, Jose Martin Felix de Arrate, con- sidered himself to be Cuban rather than Spanish. Conditions, however, improved drastically in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and throughout the early nineteenth. A belated Enlightenment brought with it a series of progressive measures in politics, agriculture, industry, and commerce - and Cuban culture began to evolve, first in literature. No national art existed yet. Art was mostly an imported commodity generally circumscribed to religious articles and pictures for the church and the laity and to those pieces of industrial art - silverware and the like -required by the best households.3 Painting began to develop in the second half of the eighteenth century with the religious art of Jose Nicolas de la Escalera (1734-1804), followed in the 1.

Needless to say, a programmatic identification with a national ideal was far beyond their imagination. Nor does one find a Cuban content in the rest of the art of the period, such as the religious pictures of Giuseppe Perovani (1765-1835), a Brescian artist who lived in Havana for a short time, or the far more extensive work of Jean-Baptiste Vermay (1788-1833), a disciple of David, and the person responsible for making the profession of painting socially accept- able, inasmuch as he was French and white and not a "free man of color" like Escalera and Escobar. His local importance notwithstanding, Vermay was little more than an adequate painter; the best artist on the island only by default. Cuban themes began to evolve when Romanticism initiated a search for a national identity, first in literature and then in painting. Two of its manifes- tations are relevant here: the analytical and the lyrical. Analytical Romanticism appeared first in Cecilia Valdes, a novel Cirilo Villaverde finished by 1839. Notwithstanding influences from Sir Walter Scott and Alessandro Manzoni, the novel is broadly based on Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris.s Villaverde turned Havana and the many characters who inhabited it into sym- bols of themselves, and proved himself to be as skillful in doing it as Hugo was in portraying fifteenth-century Paris. But such definitions of a national imagery did not find their way into painting immediately. Painting itself, as a medium of expression, had to mature first, as literature already had. Important in that respect was the work of European lithographers arriving dur- ing the second quarter of the nineteenth century, especially since they looked at Cuban subjects from a fresh perspective, with eyes that were discovering the tropics.6 What becomes remarkable is that those artists portrayed so well the characters and sites Villaverde explored, although they had no knowledge of the novel, which was not published until 1882 (but a "primitive version," as Villaverde called it, appeared in the magazine La Siempreviva in 1839). Indeed, associating the novel with their work has become commonplace - a factor of 4.

The parallels of Cecilia Valdes-Esmeralda, Leonardo Gamboa-Phebus, and Jose Dolores Pimienta- Quasimodo are almost transparent, as much as the instances of Esmeralda and Cecilia being sepa- rated from their mothers at birth, the two mothers going insane, and daughters and mothers even- tually reuniting (at the end of the novel for Cecilia and just before her death for Esmeralda). Hugo's exquisite precision in describing medieval Paris found a counterpart in Villaverde's descriptions of Havana, a coffee plantation, and a sugar mill. 6.

"', " no small importance in the subsequent development of themes of nationalism in art, especially in the twentieth century. One of those lithographers was the Frenchman Frederic Miahle (1810-1881; in Cuba, 1838-1854), who created a series of seminal images in his illustrations for Viaje Al Rededor de la Isla de Cuba [sic] (1847-1848).7 El quitrin is by far the best known among them (fig. 1). It depicts three women taking the late afternoon air in a quitrin, a carriage typical of the island in which the coach- man, a lavishly attired slave, rode on the horse. This lithograph turned out to be so popular that it became one of the standard icons of Havana, especially since Miahle placed the quitrin crossing in front of the Fuente de la India, an important local monument that in itself represents the city. In El dia de reyes (The Feast of the Epiphany) he showed black members of the Abakua secret society wearing African dress and masks and dancing in San Francisco Square on the Feast of the Epiphany, the only day of the year in which they were allowed to do so, to collect aguinaldos (gifts of money) on the Feast of the Kings, the magi who brought gifts to Jesus (fig. 2). The third most relevant lithograph is El zapateado, showing white country people enjoying the traditional dance of theguajiros (peasants) (fig. 3). Beyond any aesthetic significance, El quitrin, El dia de reyes, and El zapateado are important for showing the four major social classes of the 1840s: leisurely and poor whites and free blacks and slaves. It was partly out of a commingling of characters, attitudes, and modes of language of these four kinds of people that Cuban patterns of behavior evolved. In Cuba, contrary to developments in the United States and elsewhere, factors of nationality have always taken precedence over racial issues. Such a peculiarity, while not precluding racism, toned it down; enough to eventually allow for an integration to take place, at least among the popular classes. Of necessity, that integration became a stra- tum of nationality. 7. On Miahle, see Bellier de Chavignerie and Auvray, Dictionnaire, 2:84; and especially Emilio Cueto, Miahle's Colonial Cuba (Miami: The Historical Association of Southern Florida, 1994). 190 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="6">Miahle's imagery was complemented by the work of the Spanish Basque Victor Patricio de Landaluze (1828-1889; arrived in Cuba in 1863). The twenty-six years Landaluze lived in Cuba were rife with the anti-Spanish sentiment that led to the first war of independence, from 1868-1878. Fervidly pro-Spanish, in many of his paintings and in practically all of his newspaper illustrations, Landaluze reveled in making evident his anti-Cuban opinions. Yet, attempting to be mor- dant and satirical in his depiction of Cuban types, Landaluze displayed an acu- ity of vision that fleshed out characters whom Miahle had portrayed not with- out a measure of classical idealization and academic detachment (fig. 4). Beyond this, he brought into painting a sensuousness and even a sexuality that are sem- inal to the national character and had long been present in Cuban music. Also, his best work is imbued with choteo, that peculiar form of humor in which Cubans seem to enjoy making light of what is perceived as someone's personal or social shortcomings, but which is also an expression of friendship, of mak- ing known to the butt of one's jest that one shares in an understanding of the problem, or even tragedy, that gave rise to the joke. Finally, while his purpose was to make use of blacks, mulattoes, and poor white peasants to portray what he saw as a typically inferior colonial life, he presented Cubans with folk types in whom they could recognize themselves, and which they subsequently trans- formed into national symbols, especially those he depicted in his book Tiposy costumbres de la Isla de Cuba (1881).8 Hence his presenting folk characters in situations that he as a Spaniard found embarrassing was not seen by Cubans as at all malicious but as delightfully true to life and therefore as a mirror-like image of themselves. While an identification of folk types was important to the development of a national art, the depiction of more subtle elements of the environment - of its scale, light, and color-was also required for identifying a national aesthetic. Lyrical Romanticism brought those concerns to the forefront. That mode appeared first in Cuba, seemingly all of a sudden, in the poetry of Jose Maria Heredia (1803-1839), especially in his Oda al Nigara (1824). A political exile, when facing the falls Heredia became anguished by a memory of palm trees and recalled a countryside not magnificently sublime but amiable and smiling and inviting in bright sunlight. In this and other poems Heredia fixed for all time an image of the countryside as a nationalistic metaphor. That trope, once translated into painting, became a recurring image in art. But before Cubans explored their landscape in painting, foreigners worked first at representing it, again, mainly in lithography. The illustrations by the Frenchman Edouard Laplante (born 1818; in Cuba circa 1848) forJusto German Cantero's Los ingenios (1857), a book on sugar mills, are reputed to be the best work of lithography produced in Cuba (fig. 5).9 Laplante's vision was as fresh as it was accurate and faithfully captured the rhythms, colors, and scale of the countryside. But when one compares those lithographs with equally well-rendered views of similar landscapes elsewhere, one realizes that Laplante's eye, although extraordinarily analytical, was unen- cumbered with nationalistic affective considerations for the Cuban countryside, 8.

While the book bears an 1857 imprint, it quotes statistics of as late as 1863. Los ingenios was printed in stages, each at a different time, in the Litografia de Luis Marquier, the same that printed Miahle's Viaje Al Rededor de la Isla de Cuba in 1847-1848. Eighteen fifty-seven probably was the date the project began. DAPA 22 191</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 4. Victor Patricio de Landaluze, Los negros curros.

His lithographs are indeed superbly rendered and painstakingly printed, but his aesthetic intention went no further than producing topographical views of sugar mills. Nowhere does one find in them the nationalistic intensity of Heredia's poetry. His contribution, as well as Miahle's (who also did land- scapes), was limited in that respect.10 It was through a knowledge of the Hudson River School that Cuban artists came to paint landscapes capable of evoking an emotional national identification. Cubans sensed an aesthetid and programmatic affinity in the way American artists put forth the landscape as a primordial image of America, pristine and 10. In respect to this, I do wonder if the kind of national self-identification Cubans often find in the landscapes of Laplante and Miahle may not be a result of a transference of readings from later landscape paintings by Cuban artists well acquainted with a romantic poetry rich in national rural imagery. 192 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 5.

Also, an influence from painting to painting was easier to establish than one from lithography to painting, especially since artists moved freely between Cuba and the United States after the mid-century. Federico Fernandez Cavada (1831-1871) was one of those artists. He studied engineering in Pennsylvania and later fought in the Civil War, earning the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Union Army. He subsequently settled in Cuba, where he favored the cause of independence. As a painter he had an intimate knowledge of the Hudson River School. In Rio San Juan, Trinidad (1865) he brought to a Cuban subject the cosmic, transcendental grandeur of nature that Frederick Edwin Church portrayed in much of his work, especially in The Heart of the Andes (1859), to which Rio San Juan is compositionally close, including minute human figures that remind us of the smallness of man in comparison with the sublime. In the preceding year Fernandez Cavada had painted Paisaje cubano (Cuban Landscape), also of the Trinidad mountain range, but in this work the central feature was two palm trees, the national symbol, the very trees that Heredia had yearned for in Niagara. But it was Esteban Chartrand (1840-1883) who best fixed on canvas the char- acteristics of the Cuban landscape." His knowledge of the countryside was of long standing, having been born and raised in his family's sugar mill near Matanzas. He also was conversant with American painting; he lived for long periods in New York City and was represented there by the Goupil Gallery. Eschewing the grandeur and breadth of Frederick Edwin Church or Albert Bierstadt, Chartrand approached the quieter luminism of Martin Johnson Heade (figs. 6 and 7). The sublime has no place in his amiable world, a poeti- cal idealization of a nation seeking self-actualization. In Paisaje (Landscape), of 1880, Chartrand conveyed those feelings in one of his best works. It is a lyri- cal scene in which palm trees, a pond, and a bohio (hut), with two guajiros (peasants) in front of it were given a life of their own by the painter, who had mastered the golden transparency of light from the setting sun. Suffused in that glow, the hut, the pond, and the grove are part of a poetic whole. Moreover, 11. On Chartrand, see Rail R.

Cuba, as well as Cubans, are represented in the painting by a number of images. First, there is the land- scape as an indication of the poetry and beauty of the national environment. Then, there are the guajiros, images of unspoiled rural nobility and virtue: synecdoches of an ideal society. As one final national symbol there is the bohio, the one native-Indian building type that survived as a rural dwelling. Chartrand's work embraced all these signs and meanings, equipoised now in an arcady of harmonious delight, in order to bring the landscape up to the level of a metaphor standing for nationality. In the process he transformed the rhapsodic bravura of the Hudson River School into a soft, soothing melody, like an adagio in a minor key Such was, at the time, the poetic essence of the Cuban vernacular. Another American influence in Chartrand's work appears in El tren de Guines (The Train to Guines), a painting with a train traveling across a landscape (fig. 8). Such a realization of the coming together of modern industrial tech- nology and nature is also a nineteenth-century American theme, one that Leo Marx identified as "The machine in the garden."12 An early use of this subject 12.

Photograph by Sandy Levy. in art appears in George Inness's The Lackawanna Valley, of 1855, a painting that shows an interaction between a train and a landscape. Chartrand may well have seen this work in one of his many visits to New York. Chartrand's perception of nature's loss of innocence through technology was an isolated incident in nineteenth-century Cuban culture. In point of fact most of his work depicts that "perfect arcady" most everyone seems to have been longing for. In poetry, for instance, it was described in Rumores del Hormigo, a volume of poetryJuan Napoles y Fajardo (1829-ca. 1862), who wrote under the pseudonym of El Cucalambe. (The book was published in 1856 and the author included in the title the name of the river that runs by his native Las Tunas.) Rumores del H6rmigo is a continuous sylvan paean to the beauty of the countryside and to the emotions it causes to swell in the hearts of innocent and virtuous guajiros. Steeped in the pastoral classical poetry of Theocritus, Virgil, and the Horace of the bucolic odes, El Cucalambe created with the decima- the standard form of peasant versification - an apparently simple and naive but in fact not unsophisticated vision of a perfect, idyllic, and pristinely beautiful national rural imagery. This imagery also served him to express metaphorically his longing for independence from Spain, a desire he made patent by his deep involvement in early anti-Spanish conspiracies in 1848 and then again in 1851. The lyrical content of El Cucalambe is different from that of Chartrand in that it is direct and even seemingly objective by design; the narrator is often a person different from the character reacting emotively to the landscape. Yet there is a commonality of interests between the poetry of El Cucalambe and the art of Chartrand, one that, avowedly, may be innately lyrical. In spite of their differences, their individual efforts were consecutive attempts at defining national virtue through a use of rural themes, as opposed to urban ones vitiated by European custom, and therefore by Spain. Less than half a generation after Chartrand, Valentin Sanz Carta (1850-1898) added a new dimension to the depiction of the landscape as a national theme. A former disciple of Carlos de Haes in Madrid, Sanz Carta usually narrowed his vision to one tree, bush, clump, or at most a narrow section of landscape that he made monumental and depicted in all of its luxury (fig. 9). Thus he added a hitherto absent expression of tropical sensuality to the representation of nature. But political events soon changed the course of art. A lovely vision of the total- ity of nature standing for an image of the nation became psychologically unsus- tainable in the tense political climate of the 1880s and 1890s, which led to the last war of independence (1895-1898) and the Spanish-American War (1898). But while illusions of a placid, pastoral utopia were shattered, a desire for calm and peace became ever more evident in painters and poets. Private collection. Miami, Florida. Following that vein, Jose Arburu Morell (1864-1889) and Guillermo Collazo (1850-1896) depicted a domesticated nature. Their world would include the refuge of a garden or a prospect to be enjoyed from the secure vantage point of a well-appointed house interior. To emphasize the otherness of this pictorial environment in contrast with the harsh political realities of the world beyond, ladies of leisure - the people most removed from political cares according to the conventions of the day- usually dwell in these canvases, if at all. In Arburu Morell's Eljardin (1888) a lady sits in a rattan chair in a garden, by a fountain, fanning herself, a picture he painted the year before he died at age twenty-five (fig. 10). Two years earlier, in La siesta, Collazo had likewise depicted a woman lounging in a chair, this time inside a room partly appointed with potted palms and a large oriental carpet, looking out onto an enclosed garden and a beach beyond (fig. 11).

These paintings are stylistically a world apart from the poetry ofJulian del Casal (1863-1893), although the poet found affinity with them since they reflected as much of a desire for refuge from the realities of the day as his work did.13 In a country torn apart by war and political strife, Casal had embraced in his work the exquisite aesthetics of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Mallarme and described paintings of Gustave Moreau in some of his poems. More to the point at hand, he created for himself in his rooms a rarefied atmosphere of Chinese silks, Japanese screens, Moorish lamps, and Persian carpets, where the realities of the world beyond were excluded as much as the harsh tropical sunlight the poet so much disliked. Decadence, however, had no place in painting, since artists continued to develop the theme of nature-as-symbol. But the landscape was no longer the image of 13.

'.:', nature artists pursued; tropical light had taken its place. Arburu Morell, and even more so Collazo, expanded their experiments on chromatic brilliance. The more they followed the lead of Sanz Carta by focusing on a narrow field of vision, the more they became conscious of effects of luminosity, both on shiny surfaces of vegetation and on reflections from walls, white or otherwise. Elpatio, a picture by Collazo representing a courtyard rich with tropical plants drenched in sunlight, is possibly the best example of this trend. The work attests to Collazo's mastery over new artistic conceptions of pure, tropical color burst- ing with light; with reds, greens, whites, and yellows contrasting with each other, all existing in a world where there is no possibility for the chiaroscuro of foreign latitudes. With this and other pictures, Collazo, and Arburu Morell as well, all but completed the repertory for pictorial representation of national physical characteristics. In hindsight we recognize that only two steps were missing to close the cycle the landscapes of Fernandez Cavada had begun a few decades earlier: an analysis of national idiosyncracy and a programmatic nationalist synthesis. Those two stages would come in the twentieth century. Yet, after independence in 1902, painting changed little. Armando Menocal (1863 -1942), Jose Joaquin Tejada (1867-1943), and, above all, Leopoldo Romafiach (1862-1951) extended late-nineteenth-century art well into the new century, strengthening a free academicism. But as painting turned into a series of exercises of excellent and even superb academic virtuosity, literature was creating a new vision. Once independent from Spain, writers chose to con- front truth instead of inventing an ideal future (as had been the goal of much of the literature of the last seventy years or so of colonial rule). Writers now transferred nationalistic values from a rural utopia to urban realities; the exoti- cism of Casal had died out with him. Twentieth-century culture was heralded mostly by the novels of Miguel de Carri6n (1875 -1929). His two best works, Las bonradas (1918) and Las impuras (1919), concern themselves with social realities of middle-class women and prostitutes DAPA 22 197</page><page sequence="13">living in a world dominated by men. The social criticism of Carlos Loveira (1882-1928), a self-taught railroad worker and world traveler, went beyond Carri6n's, especially in Los inmorales (1919) and, above all, inJuan Criollo (1928), the story of a poor young man who, because of social constraints, finds it necessary to commit all kinds of immoralities to raise himself from servant to member of the House of Representatives. Beyond the work of Carrion and Loveira, the novels of Jesus Castellanos (1879-1912), Alfonso Hernandez Cata (1885-1940), Jose Antonio Ramos (1885-1943), and Luis Rodriguez Embil (1879-1954) completed a picture of social reality that was far from perfect, much less utopian. A major cultural event of this period, one that opened many avenues for expres- sion, was the publication of the first issue of Social in January 1916. A monthly magazine covering literature, art, architecture, fashion, travel, and society news edited by Conrado W Massaguer (1889-1965), Social was published through 1933, and again from 1935 through 1938. Elegantly printed, richly illustrated, and served by a first-rate staff that included Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring,14 Social became an open forum for the avant-garde, both national and foreign; it created as well an extraordinary amalgam by bridging the gap between the haute bourgeoisie and the world of writers, thinkers, and artists. Soon the offices of Social became a meeting place for the intelligentsia, but since they were located on the Calzada del Cerro and therefore somewhat removed from the center of Havana, in 1923 the group began meeting for lunch at the Lafayette Hotel on Saturdays. In 1927 that group of intellectuals and artists - by far the most important in the nation - organized themselves as El grupo minorista and made known their manifesto in favor of political freedom and cultural reform, supporting "the new ideas."15 In that same year of 1927 the revista de avance [sic] was founded byJorge Manach, Juan Marinello, Francisco Ichazo, Alejo Carpentier, and Marti Casanovas (the latter two soon replaced byJose Zacarias Tallet and Felix Lizaso). This impor- tant publication, which only lasted through 1930, was created expressly to pro- mote the vanguardia in literature and the arts and supplanted Social as the main standard bearer of progressive thought, with some issues dedicated to one writer, as was the case on the occasion of Garcia Lorca's visit to Havana in 1930. Concurrently, a modern poetry had been developing since 1913 when Regino Boti (1878-1958) published Arabescos mentales. Subsequently Agustin Acosta (1886-1979) published Ala in 1915 and Jose Manuel Poveda (1888-1926) Versos precursores in 1917. In 1928 Mariano Brull (1891-1956) wrote Poemas en men- guante, a book in which he made use of meaningless combinations of letters having an inner rhythm all to themselves. He used the collective name ofjitan- jaforas to identify these poems, which were an attempt to attain to the purely abstract realm of rhythm. More importantly for painting, apoesia negra also 14. Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring (1889-1964) was an outstanding scholar and historian. From 1956 on he served as official historian of the City of Havana, heading the Oficina del Historiador de la Ciudad.

Cuban poets suddenly took notice of their own surroundings; the Afro-Cuban culture in their midst was the original document Europeans sought. In the opinion of Jorge and Isabel Castellanos, "The aesthetic values of Afro-Cuban religions were discovered in Cuba in the 1920s and established an influence of great strength in the national poetical movement."16 To most everyone's admission, black culture was a major discovery, and themes, rhythms, and language taken from the black vernacular became fused with rhythms and meters adopted from the new European poetry-Lorca's being by far the major influence in that respect. In 1926 Alfonso Camin pub- lished Elogio de la negra and in 1928 Ram6n Guirao wrote Bailadora de rumba and Jose Zacarias Tallet La rumba. Also in 1928, Alejo Carpentier and Amadeo Roldan collaborated in the production of La rebambaramba, a ballet mixing themes derived from Miahle and Landaluze and avant-garde music based on black rhythms and forms. In 1930 Nicolas Guillen published Motivos del son, followed a year later by Songoro cosongo. iEcue-Yamba-O! (1933), Carpentier's first novel, was also based on Afro-Cuban themes. This new interest in Afro- Cuban culture was, as well, part of an international movement taking place in the Hispanic world and paralleled similar events abroad, as when the Indian became central to a new vision of Mexico, the gaucho the symbol of Argentina, and the gypsy an important feature in the Spanish intellectual landscape. In Cuba, however, the trend became much more racially inclusive than abroad. Whites and mulattoes were indiscriminately brought forward as much as blacks to create an image of the new Cuba, a consequence of the cultural and racial integration that had already taken place among the popular classes. Following in the wake of the poets, painters became convinced that the most important function of a new art should be to reveal newly discovered national values through methods of vanguardia. Given that premise, the creation of a national imagery took precedence over investigation of modern form. Thus, the intellectuality inherent in the monochrome of the early Cubists found no echo in Cuban art, which pursued its interests in the emotional, pure, vibrant, contrasting colors of its natural environment. Moreover, Cuban artists dismissed the standard subjects of the new painting -as fixed by contemporaneous European masters - and concentrated on folk characters, thus strengthening the cultural integration of painting and poetry. The limits set by nineteenth-century art to the extent of nationalist topics were subverted in the process. Notions of Cubanness were now identified with urban themes, and when rural ones were explored, their signification was distinctively social or psychological, never lyrical or utopian, since both characteristics were now considered to be irrelevant and superficial, even maudlin. Collectively, therefore, the "Generation of 1927"-so called because the first exhibition of arte nuevo took place in May 1927- made much broader iconographical and iconological statements than did previous artists (fig. 12).17 By turning to the vernacular to create works of high art, the new painters, like the new poets, embraced characters, features, and emotions they felt to be innately theirs, 16.

In their enthusiasm the painters of the vanguardia all but exhausted the catalogue of national idiosyncracies and characteristics, representing them one by one within a span of about fifteen years.18 It is standard to open a discussion on the Generation of 1927 with Victor Manuel (1897-1969), an elegant draftsman, an able colorist, and the first Cuban artist to demonstrate an interest in abstraction.19 The work he did upon 18.

Also, he brought into a twentieth-century context conceptions of tropical color and studies on the reflection of light pursued by late-nineteenth- century Cuban artists. Color, rather than being a reality, now became an abstrac- tion of its own reality, a depiction of an idea of what was tropical rather than a representation of factual luminosity. Furthermore, Victor Manuel introduced into art folk characters who no longer were presented as curious specimens of picturesqueness, as had been previously the case not only in painting but also in the teatro bufo since the 1860s (fig. 13). One result of the new iconographical importance of the popular classes was that painters made use of them to depict sensual and sexual subject matters they considered to be features of the national iconology and, hence, worthy of recognition. Three pictures, one by Antonio Gattorno (1904-1980), another by Eduardo Abela (1889-1965), and a third by Carlos Enriquez (1900-1957), will serve to explore the progression of this theme from allusion to a frank depiction of lust. The understructure of Gattorno's El rio, of 1927, was a result of influences stemming mainly from the Mexican muralists (fig. 14).20 The important factor of the painting, however, is that Gattorno's deliberate sensuality of line and color has made two monumental female nudes harmonize with a background of a banana tree and a landscape of rounded brown hills that echo the shapes of their bodies. Tropical sensuality has made an appearance here, albeit indi- 4~~~^ ~rectly. Gattorno makes a veiled ithyphallic suggestion in the forthcoming fruit of the banana tree and reinforces his message with the presence of a fruit ven- Fig. 14.

' (Abela had been to Paris and Pascin had been to Havana),22 the artist portrayed an allegorical group that rushes forth from a beach pounded by the surf. The main figure is a mulattress dressed in white, who seems to hover above ground. Behind her swirl three bongoseros (drum players) and two allegorical protec- tive deities, whose wings become as one with palm fronds and banana leaves. Here Abela has recalled a standard religious iconography of saints and angels to portray the power, energy, and sensuality of the rumba, as it sways to and fro and surges forth from the sea onto the island with all the strength and self-assured presence of a conquering force demanding to become a national icon. Raw sexuality exploded in the paintings of Carlos Enriquez, and El rapto de las mulatas (The Rape of the Mulattresses), of 1938, is the best example of his 20.

The bandolero, the white-peasant-turned-highwayman, had long been a symbol of maleness, of the macho who lives on his cunning, courage, and fortitude. His lust is part of his legend. Tales of his sexual prowess precede him and most women give themselves openly to him, although he will indulge in rape if he so desires. The mulattress is his symbolic counterpart. Beautiful and boastful of her looks, her appetites are best served by assertive, impetuous debauchery. In El rapto de las mulatas the man to the far right holds one of the women fast against him. His eyes are concealed under the brim of his hat, but one senses that he is looking lustfully at her breasts, which she pulls up by bring- ing her shoulders back while looking at him, clearly proud of her body.

To make the imagery complete, Enriquez shows the couples riding unbridled wild horses - images of raw animal lust that he painted in a fiery, almost demonic, red. To strengthen his iconography, Enriquez worked in his peculiar style of frenzied juxtapositions and superpositions of reds and blues, yellows and greens, blacks and browns, and purples and greys. They slide into each other and swirl and twist to become either transparent planes of color, translucent surfaces glow- ing with inner fire, or masses of sumptuously erotic substance, all in combina- tions that make the wildest dreams of Franz Marc (whose work Enriquez may have seen during his European sojourn of 1930-1934) seem subdued and tame by comparison. In less than a decade Gattorno, Abela, and Carlos Enriquez shattered most notions of bourgeois decorum, celebrating joy, sensuality, and lust. Concurrently, Fidelio Ponce (1895-1949) worked from the other side of the spectrum: that of what he considered to be the worst remaining aspects of the Spanish heri- tage, traits that in his opinion were still ever-present and dominating within certain circles.24 His was a world of religious hypocrisy; of grief and fear and sorrow; of dried up, pious, ignorant old women; and of people dying of tuber- culosis. Ponce never turned to the avant-garde; he created his art by himself out of elements and pieces he chose from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish painting, the period of history whose influence he seems to have wanted to exorcise out of the national experience (fig. 17). In his paintings figures reminiscent of those of El Greco inhabit a desolate landscape permeated by the white of the paintings of Zurbaran (never the joyful white of the young 24.

Fig. 18. Lorenzo Romero Arciaga, La taza de cafe, oil on board, 97.3 x 123 cm, ca. 1940. Museum of Arts and Sciences, Daytona Beach, Florida, Cuban Foundation Collection. Among the manifold aspects of the national collective psyche being represented at the time, innate nobility and innocence also called out for recognition. Rural themes furnished the required imagery; the guajiro became an iconographi- cal entity standing for redemptive qualities unattainable in the corrupt quag- mire of cities Carrion, Loveira, and others had depicted in their novels. The guajiro was meant to make the viewer recall his lost innocence and supposedly make him long to retrieve it, although knowing all along that such a desire was no longer possible to fulfill. This moralizing function does not imply that the guajiro was seen as a hero. On the contrary, these paintings are mostly anec- dotal, created in the hope that a desire for goodness might result from con- templating images of the charming simplicity of the rural life. One such instance would consider, for example, that having a family picture taken was a grand, important event, as Aristides Fernandez (1904-1934) described it in Lafamilia se retrata (The Family Has Its Picture Taken). The generosity of the guajiro, even when living in extreme poverty, was to be revealed also. Lorenzo Romero Arciaga picked up the subject and represented it through the ritual of offering a cup of coffee as a sign of welcome in La taza de caf6 (The Cup of Coffee), of circa 1940 (fig. 18). Furthermore, inJugadores de domino, 1942, Abela made evident the nobility of the type in the calm monumentality in which he depicted a group ofguajiros, even if they are engaged in something as commonplace as a game of dominoes (fig. 19). The imagery of the new rural themes, therefore, lacked the universality typical of nineteenth-century exam- ples in which nature had stood as an emblem of a culture to be attained, and the guajiro had been but another element within a lyrical, all-encompassing, utopian landscape. The collective discourse of modern artists and avant-garde intellectuals was much too complex to reach consensus, especially since differ- ent currents seemed at cross-purposes, either extolling, denouncing, or merely making evident as many aspects as possible of the national idiosyncracy. The Weltanschauung was too confusing; too much was being revealed too fast and too richly. Competing with diverse images, each one as culturally impor- tant as the next, the subject of theguajiro was, if not a call for collective moral improvement, at least a respite looking back at mythical origins that, ironically enough, never existed. A theme parallel to innocence was that of tener confianza, a typical form of spontaneously open behavior that allows one to call a new acquaintance mi hermano (my brother) and any person of the opposite sex mi querercito (my little darling) with no aforethought or intention of disrespect. Confianza was more conspicuously evident among the urban working class, a social cate- gory untainted by the reticence of the haute bourgeoisie. Instinctively, people seemed to realize that the main virtue of confianza resided in its capacity for diffusing many of the tensions of living in close proximity to each other, a con- dition that could lead to abrasiveness at times. So deeply ingrained was confi- anza in popular neighborhoods that people who did not practice it, who "gave themselves airs," while not ostracized, were certainly the butt of every- one's choteo behind their backs. Estampas de San Crist6bal, of 1926, a book byJorge Mafiach, is a good introduction to the subject. Ostensibly a collection of vignettes of popular life in Havana, it is in fact a sociological document of the first order, describing a rich variety of urban human types interacting with each other.

Barberia (Barbershop), a painting from 1942 by Cundo, appears to be influ- enced by Picasso's so-called Neoclassical period, especially in the monumen- tality of the figures. But as usual when analyzing Cuban art, stylistic filiation is of less interest than iconological content; formal issues here are but a point of departure for delving into the national ethos (fig. 20). An important feature in this painting is that, contrary to standard practice, the barber is sitting down while giving a customer a haircut. He sits on a taburete, a cheap chair made out of wood and rawhide. The use of a taburete is a sign that this barbershop is in a popular neighborhood, the kind that doubles as a poor man's club, where men come after work to talk or read a newspaper far more often than for a haircut or a shave. Cundo's barbershop is a microcosm where confianza is a 25. I follow the standard Cuban convention - one that is totally arbitrary - of calling some artists by their first names, others, by their last names, and yet some others by their first and last names. Hence, for instance, it is always Cundo, Mariano, and Amelia, never Berm6dez, Rodriguez, or Pelaez. Portocarrero, on the other hand, is always Portocarrero, or at times "Porto," but never Rene. Equally, Wifredo Lam is always called Lam, yet Carlos Enriquez is known always as Carlos Enriquez, never as Carlos or Enriquez. 206 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 20.

He represented this condition not only by showing the barber sitting down like his customer but, even more tellingly, by giving each the same face. The two men stand as portraits of the same archetype. As extensions of each other they trust one another implicitly, in the goodness of complete confianza. It could be argued that such trusting behavior may be found among people of a similar class in many parts of the world, and undoubtedly this is so, but Barberia is specifically a representation of Cuban confianza because the iconog- raphy is fully Cuban. For instance, Cundo gave the men features that could be taken for those of a typically white middle-class Cuban with poor immigrant Spanish parents. By contrast, Orozco or Rivera would have probably painted a Mexican scene and given them Indian features. Cundo's barbershop is also telling. It has the flavor of a room in an old colonial palace, the kind that original owners had abandoned generations earlier and perhaps turned into a solar, or tenement house. The exaggerated Baroque-like ornamentation of the chair, the pattern of the tile floor, and the classical monumentality of the cabi- net in the background, with two barberpoles on top that look like fat columns, speak to a colonial grandeur that anywhere else would be inconsistent with a DAPA 22 207</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 21.

The painting, then, tells a tale of infor- mality, of friendships that are made quickly and last forever, and of a trust in one's fellow man based on a deeply rooted notion of social and cultural equal- ity. Such is the camaraderie of confianza. Inasmuch as vanguardia painters sought their subjects in daily life, the tradi- tional grandiloquence of history painting remained outside their interests. Nevertheless, historical subjects did crop up here and there. In 1934 Carlos Enriquez made use of his characteristic fiery style to paint one of the best examples of the genre. His Muerte de Marti (Death of Marti) is a splendid portrayal of the manic essence of a heroic death (fig. 21). It would indeed be hard to overemphasize that the artists of the Generation of 1927 discovered the multifariousness of Cuban culture. By so doing, their work established the second stage in the process of expressing the national iconology. Confianza, sensuality, lust, machismo, Afro-Cuban music, the nobility of theguajiro, the consequences of exaggerated views on religion, the easy- going ways of the middle class, and even occasionally, the national sagas were but a few of the many themes painters explored. Without fear of exhausting the list, one could add as well contrasts between rich and poor, the allegorical qualities of the local flora and fauna, the importance of Afro-Cuban religions, and the ubiquitous presence of the blue of sea and sky. Although it only lasted for about fifteen years, the Generation of 1927 left a splendid legacy: it solidi- fied the position of Cuban modern art, nationally and internationally; it inves- tigated a considerable number of solutions to formal and compositional prob- lems; and it created a body of work of substantial quality. But perhaps its out- standing contribution - establishing the second stage in the development of the national iconology--hinged on its analytical acumen, one that was as col- lective as it was spontaneous. Likewise, the enthusiasm it shared with poets in a mutual intent to reveal the scope of national culture had also certainly been important to its success. After such an extraordinary collective feat of analysis, a synthesis was in order, or at least a series of them. Mariano Rodriguez (born 1912), Rene Portocarrero (1912-1985), Amelia Pelaez (1896-1968), and Wifredo Lam (1902-1982), with no thought whatsoever of consensus - other than that furnished by a strong Zeitgeist- proceeded to shape the third and last stage in the unfolding of a national iconology. They set for themselves, individually, the task to represent in pictures that which was transcendentally Cuban. Yet to accomplish their work all they had was the standard immanent medium of form and color. Of neces- sity, their artistry was to provoke an empathetic response from the viewer, or at least his recognition of an evocation. The collective title of Gallo pintado (Painted Rooster) given by Mariano to a number of his paintings is telling. The reality of artifice is acknowledged and thus the irreality of painting is made evident. These are not roosters but images of roosters, abstractions that appear to be concrete whatever the circumstances, even if two of them are engaged in a cockfight (fig. 22). From such a position the artist was then able to consider the rooster as a symbol of whatever he wanted it to be. Mariano chose to concentrate on the idea of a rich polychromy that stood for the entire chromatic experience of the physical environment. But unlike Collazo, who depicted in the nineteenth century what he saw as the reality of tropical light, Mariano considered only the idea of it, and arbitrarily transferred that conception to the plumage of a rooster.

A gor- geously tropical entity was made to convey a meaning approaching an absolute abstraction, an ideality. Portocarrero also transformed his knowledge of Cuba into a chromatic synthe- sis, and while not attempting to define an essence, he did evoke it. In his work both the iconological and aesthetic significance of color surpassed any impor- tance the iconographical content might have, even though that content ran practically the full gamut of the Cuban repertory, from colonial interiors to landscapes to images ofsanteria. Portocarrero's color is of a special quality, for it is based on the experience of seeing sunlight going through mediospuntos de colores. A medio punto consists of a geometrical pattern of fairly large pieces of colored glass, predominantly blue, red, yellow, and green, with occasional transparent pieces, inserted in the semicircular area of an arched doorway in a colonial building (fig. 23). As an architectural device mediospuntos softened the harshness of tropical light while allowing it to filter into rooms. Medios puntos make an extraordinarily rich statement in the stately interiors of colo- nial palaces, especially if there are several doors in a row; richer yet is the vel- vety geometric patterns of color that light going through the mediospuntos makes on the marble floors. That visual experience allows for an exquisitely intimate understanding of the chromatic essence of what is usually meant by "tropical." 26 Moreover, inasmuch as that understanding can only take place in colonial buildings that evoke strong empathetic responses to tradition and 26. In spite of obvious differences in style, scale, and historical context, the experience is similar to coming to an understanding of the chromatic essence of the Gothic when seeing light coming through a stained-glass window in a medieval building. 210 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="26">*1 i ; .? ? r; I??u ? ;.F '"; I: -??*. .,rp*yiT, w *.? i.id ? ? ??? *r?W1 -?i I, diSPs --I" I ILlllbn - ii s rr ?;? .. . ?I ???:lr:i '?! li:C?JPC,*Xi.; 13;LIYH:I5;z;??s rCaFr :ik ?r*-in? -i???i</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 25.

Private collection, Miami, Florida. history, it is not surprising that Portocarrero availed himself of that experience and turned it into the nationalist cornerstone of his art. It is easy to see in a painting like Interior del Cerro (1943) how Portocarrero based his work on the mediopunto (fig. 24). The entire surface, including the girl, the chairs, the plant stand, and the doors beyond, is painted to recall stained glass - or its reflection. However, a landscape like his El diablito rojo (The Red Small Devil) (1944), to choose an example at random, makes one realize why Portocarrero retained the same chromatic values throughout his life (fig. 25). Time and again he was bringing to his art what he had learned from mediospuntos as an embodiment of the essence of tropical light and color. Thanks to that lesson, his chromatic symbolism of nationality became far more reflective of the Cuban essence than even the large number of national subjects he painted. So far all Cuban iconography had been based on clearly recognizable repre- sentations of people, animals, plants, objects, and the environment, whether urban or rural. An imagery everyone could easily understand was a quintessential requirement of a nationalist iconography; otherwise art could not fulfill its didactic and even propagandistic purposes. The representation of the Cuban iconology, or of aspects of it, placed such limitations on composition. Amelia Pelaez's extraordinary contribution was to show how an abstract imagery could be used to present an all-encompassing view of Cuban culture instead of 212 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 26. Amelia Pelaez, Marpacifico, oil on canvas, 73.4 x 94.93 cm, 1936. Private collection, Miami, Florida. Fig. 27. Amelia Pelaez, Naturaleza muerta, oil on canvas, 66 x 100.5 cm, 1946. Photograph by Sandy Levy. Private collection, Miami, Florida. only selected aspects of it. Yet she always kept her work well within the bound- aries of a sensuously organic Cuban aesthetic and never allowed her sense of composition to digress into the intellectualism that is so often a characteristic of abstraction.27 A former disciple of Alexandra Exter in Paris, Amelia would usually begin a painting with a rigorously geometric structure that would stand as a basis for the composition and bring order to it. Upon this she would super- impose a winding black Baroque line that reminds one of colonial ironwork. Bursting with energy, that line sways in undulations, bends back upon itself, and then moves on, sweeping across the canvas with a cadence Amelia seems to have extracted out of the essence that also gave birth to the nineteenth- century contradanza. Beyond this, she would paint a background of vibrant, primary colors that she took directly out of a medio punto, or of her idea of the primordial one. Finally, as her Cuban signature, she would add a central feature of tropical fish - still fresh from the day's catch- or fruit just purchased from a vendor who had come to her door or perhaps a flower, more often than not a hibiscus she had just picked in her garden and monumentalized on her canvas, an imagery she began to develop shortly after her return from her Paris sojourn (1927-1934) (figs. 26 and 27). Strong and bold in her painting, but shy and gentle in her everyday life, Amelia's synthesis of the Cuban experience was as personal as it was introspective. Perhaps recalling her uncle, the poet Julian del Casal, she created a refuge for herself and her mother and sisters in a house in La Vibora, an early-twentieth- century suburb of Havana. There, houses rendered in the Neo-Baroque style 27 On Amelia, see mainlyJose G6mez Sicre, "Amelia Pelaez: Modern Baroque," Americas 6 (December 1954): 12-17; Lo6l de la Torriente, "Ambiente y estetica de Amelia Pelaez," Cuadernos Americanos 27 (1968): 236-243; Museo Cubano de Arte y Cultura, ed., Amelia Peldez, 1896-1968: Una Retrospectiva/A Retrospective, with an essay by Giulio V Blanc (Miami: Museo Cubano de Arte y Cultura, 1988); and Alejandro G.

The lushness of her garden, which she tended herself, as well as the experience of light going through a medio punto, and a realization that the Baroque quality of the decorative ironwork in her windows matched the sensuousness of tropical fruit, fish, and flowers, and that their color, in turn, was also that of the medio punto, were things that Amelia came to understand and enjoy every day with- out having to leave her house, a microcosm representing for her the entire Cuban experience. All of this, and nothing more, she proceeded to synthesize on her canvases. Amelia- in the opinion of Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art of New York-"helped to bring Latin American art into the twentieth century."28 But still another synthesis was to take place. During the century that spans from the lithographs of Miahle to the early Afro-Cuban pictures of Wifredo Lam, black culture was frequently described by artists, often with intimate knowledge. None, however, penetrated its essence. An observer gets the impression that those artists were outsiders looking in, even if they shared in the beliefs of santeria and mayombe, the two principal religious systems Africans brought with them, and which many whites subsequently adopted. Lam was different from the rest. His work touched upon the essence of black hagiography.29 Lam gained consciousness of his Cubanness- at least as an artist -when he returned from Europe at the outbreak of World War Two. Once he reimmersed himself in the Afro-Cuban religious practices of his youth, he matured into the artist he was meant to be. His painting of a Cuartofamba (1947), a room with symbolic markings used for religious practices, is a landmark within that process of reacquaintance (fig. 28). His previous work in Paris, and being befriended there by Picasso and Andre Breton, had been means to hone his skills for his life's work; his experience in Paris had been similar to that of a gifted student who attends an outstanding school with superb teachers (fig. 29). As is stan- dard with Cuban artists, foreign influences provided him with a set of discrete features that he pieced together as the infrastructure upon which he constructed his art. Another Cuban characteristic of Lam was that the iconography he dis- covered was far more important than any stylistic filiation his work might show. Lam transcended his Cubanness while making use of Afro-Cuban subjects; his depiction of black lore portrays emotions that are felt universally.30 There is a hermetic quality to his work that goes far beyond a direct depiction of images of santeria and mayombe. Nowhere in his pictures does one find an image that anyone could recognize as any of the saints of the Catholic Church blacks of the diaspora associated with African deities, a standard iconography of other painters who treated the subject. The power of his imagery lies in being allusive, 28. Quoted in Geraldine P Biller, Latin American Women Artists, 1915-1995 (Milwaukee, Wis.: Milwaukee Art Museum, 1995), 103. 29.

Afro-Cuban beliefs, however, do not include an idea of a supreme transcendent being beyond Olofi and Olordumare, respectively the father and mother of heaven and earth.31 Through allusions to the orishas, or African deities, Lam forces us to sense awe, reverence, and deep fear; we are standing face to face with aspects of super- natural power, each more magical and mysterious than the next. Lam's religious purposes imparted strong surreal qualities to his work. In his canvases women become birds, birds become plants, and anthropomorphic beasts have four legs that end in hands (fig. 30). These stand side by side with strange and often frighteningly anthropomorphic, gynecomorphic, or androg- ynous figures of his own creation. While some of these figures have a ground to stand on, most hover and fly in an oneiric landscape, one without even a reference to a horizon line, even if they might have a teleological signification. The light in which they exist is also different from that which most Cuban artists loved to capture. Lam's world is suffused with the strange light of dreams and the colors it engenders (fig. 31).32 There are further puzzles to his iconography. In some of his works breasts and testicles metamorphose themselves into meanings that seem to be other than sexual, for each cancels the other as much as they complement each other. And such may be the case as well when the attributes of a beast comprise a moon crescent that itself may be part of a face and a cloven hoof that hangs from a limp, ribbon-like limb. The signification of a horned bird that issues out of, but remains attached to, a mother's neck is equally difficult to read. One can go no further than saying that these figures 31. See R6mulo Lachatafiere, El sistema religioso de los afrocubanos (Havana: Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 1992), especially 100-102. 32. Through his work the chiaroscuro -the quintessential light of ambiguity-made its appearance again in Cuban art, especially in his later graphic work, which recalls bright colors seen under a cold, overcast sky, as is so often the case in Paris.

It may also be possible that what we perceive as a riddle is nothing more than a result of the ineffable character of the universal. When we face Lam's work- as is standard when we encounter the sublime - it regales us with the fulfillment of knowing that we have recognized the existence of the universal beyond what is nothing more than a pictograph of a man's intima- tion of the supernatural. The culmination that Lam and Amelia represent was matched and even sur- passed in literature by Jose Lezama Lima (1910-1976), a hermetic poet for whom it was standard to enclose a metaphor within another metaphor to reach still a third, which in turn conveyed an intimation of the transcendent. 216 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="32">Lezama was also the person who brought together El grupo de Origenes, a group of poets and intellectuals with parallel interests whose main venue was Origenes, a journal Lezama published from 1944 through 1956, reputedly the most important literary periodical in the Hispanic world at the time. A sign that El grupo de Origenes exhausted the expression of the tangible within the col- lective Cuban experience in literature, as much as Portocarrero, Amelia, and Lam had done in art, was their search for metaphors and adumbrations probing into far deeper layers of the Cuban experience than those hitherto explored. One of their interests - as made evident in the journal's issue of winter 1948- was an exploration by Maria Zambrano of the characteristics of "prenatal Cuba," a literary image meant to signify that aspects of nationality were of such a par- ticular intimacy that they could be compared to genetic characteristics, albeit almost mystical in nature. Lezama completed the group's search for the origins and nature of transcen- dence in his most representative works, his two novels: Paradiso (1966) and Oppiano Licario (1977, posthumous), on which he worked most of his life, especially Paradiso. The novels take place mostly in Havana and comprise a unified whole with scores of characters, each with a different personality and a limited range of capabilities, urges, and aspirations, but each representing an aspect of the archetypal man. With the help of that device the reader is taken up a pyramid of ever-ascending layers of the human experience to embrace the final transcendence in the last chapter of Oppiano Licario. Once the sum- mit of awareness is reached, the reader understands that all the sundry and seemingly disparate events covered in the two novels were but severally per- ceived material, emotional, and intellectual clues to the existence of a final truth, and that those separate facts, feelings, entities, and thoughts were part of a collective whole, and also, mysteriously related to each other. In point of fact, while Lezama's style has often been called Baroque, the structure of his novels recalls the manner in which in a Gothic cathedral seemingly unrelated elements of architecture, sculpture, and painting combine themselves together into a whole that in the end expresses transcendence. Lezama's universal synthesis closed a chapter in Cuban literary history that Heredia's lyricism and Villaverde's analysis had opened in the nineteenth cen- tury. Similarly, Amelia and Lam, by attempting to encompass the whole of the Cuban experience in their paintings, completed the task begun by Fernandez Cavada and Chartrand. Thus, there is an elegant symmetry to the stages of the Cuban process of self-identification through art and literature. In art that process began with a prefatory period running from the 1830s to the early 1860s, dominated by French lithographers. Then came the first truly Cuban painting from the 1860s through the first quarter of the twentieth century. In that stage artists explored many of the bucolic themes defined by Romantic poetry from the 1820s through the late 1850s. Concurrently, folk characters that Villaverde had described in Cecilia Valdes were identified pic- torially by Landaluze; another interest of the times was an exploration of the characteristics of tropical light. The second stage came with the Generation of 1927. Artists of that period expanded on the discoveries of their predecessors and added their own extraordinary contributions during the approximately fifteen years of the vanguardia, laying bare most of the characteristics of the national ethos. Finally, in the third period, running from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, new artists created syntheses that stood for the entire national experience. Like the plot in Lezema's novels, the development of a national art was an ascending process: the first stage investigated physical characteris- DAPA 22 217</page><page sequence="33">tics of the environment; the second depicted the social idiosyncracies of the nation; and the third embraced the entire culture in abstraction. All of this had taken place in a compressed period of around eighty years. By 1947, at the time the APEC-Agrupacion de Pintores y Escultores Cubanos - became incor- porated "to establish a Cuban sense of plasticity," the aim, in fact, had been fully accomplished.33 All subsequent art could find a base on the iconology discovered roughly between 1865 and 1945, as much as, for instance, Renoir made use of French themes set in place in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The development of a Cuban national art brings some thoughts to mind. First, one encounters an extraordinarily rich production in a country that at the turn of the nineteenth century could boast of no better painters than Escalera, Escobar, or Vermay. Secondly, one finds a close symbiotic relationship between society and the physical environment. The quality of light on the island is very impor- tant in that respect. Its effect on hills and valleys, on palm fronds and fruit and flowers, on the color it gives to the sea, on how it reflects from surfaces of buildings, and on the way it makes human skin glow brings an important mea- sure of joy and insouciance to the quality of life.34 It promotes confianza and laughter, choteo and camaraderie. Without that particular light the physical envi- ronment would be meaningless; and without the physical environment the zest for life wilts. Thirdly, Cuban sensuality must be taken into account. The intel- lectual rigor made evident by the quality of literature and art is always concealed under an exploding sensuality. It appears under many guises, whether in the pervading light of Chartrand, the reflections of sunlight on the vegetation of Sanz Carta or Collazo, or in the languor of a figure by Arburu Morell. Later, it is evident on the faces of Victor Manuel's characters, the hills of a background of a painting by Gattorno, a mulattress representing El triunfo de la rumba, or more directly, in the work of Carlos Enriquez. Even Ponce, the most ascetic of Cuban painters, brought a measure of sensuality to the lines and rhythms of figures that dwell in a world purposefully anti-Cuban grey and sad and dense. Sensuality appears as well in the plumage of Mariano's roosters, Portocarrero's chromatic synthesis, and above all, the paintings of Amelia. There it all but explodes joyfully in the intensity of her colors, the lushness of her fruit and flowers, and the musicality of her Baroque line, which responds to a rhythm that is neither Spanish nor African because it is typically Cuban. With Lam the cycle of national self-identification in the arts came round. His work is surreal, oneirical, and transcendent. While many of his figures are forcefully sexual, the sensuality of his art, especially in the later work, is subsumed under the char- acteristics of his personal landscape, in which the Cuban physical environment is in scant evidence. Such a personal as opposed to collective -notion of sensuality is a further indication of his position at the close of the cycle of national self-identification, with some characteristics beginning to move away from a century-old norm. Finally, one notices idealization as a strong constituent 33. Needless to say- and as is widely known- Mariano, Portocarrero, Amelia, Lam, as well as the earlier painters, continued working for years; some are still doing so. The APEC, as an institution, lasted until 1950. Its members were Amelia Pelaez, Victor Manuel, Fidelio Ponce, Carlos Enriquez, Wifredo Lam, Mario Carreno, Rene Portocarrero, Mariano Rodriguez, Luis Martinez Pedro, Cundo Bermudez, Felipe Orlando, Roberto Diago, Julio Girona, and Osvaldo Gutierrez. See Castro, El arte, 58. 34. These facts have often been noted by travelers. One of the best examples of such statements is that of the Swedish novelist Fredrika Bremer (1801-1865), who, in 1851, writing to her sister, noted time and again how enthralled she was by the quality of Cuban light. See Fredrika Bremer, The Homes of the New World: Impressions of America (1853; New York: Negro Universities Press, 1968), 2:252-420. 218 DAPA 22</page><page sequence="34">&amp; a 7' Fig. 31.

Perforce this kind of imagery needs to be allegorical mulattresses, Amelia's hibiscuses, or Lam's orishas. In retrospect, one realizes the obvious, namely that the process we have sur- veyed bears the twofold mark of a post-colonial development: it was passion- ately self-conscious and it took place in a fairly short period of time. Its success is likewise evident. It is made patent by the many ways literature and art por- trayed the national idiosyncracy; and even closer to the subject at hand, by the quality of the paintings. o Note I wish to thank my colleagues Gail Geiger and Steve Orso and my student Paul Stoller for their suggestions on this paper, but most especially I wish to acknowledge my debt of gratitude to my late teacher, Eugenio Batista, who many years ago taught me how to look at Cuban art. I also acknowledge the help of William Bunce, Emilio Cueto, Thomas Gombar, and Lesbia O. Varona, who helped me to obtain illustrations.
