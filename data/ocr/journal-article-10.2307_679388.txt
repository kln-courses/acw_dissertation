<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion and Social Structure in The Division of Labor ERNEST WALLWORK Syracuse University The article offers a thoroughgoing reinterpretation of The Division of Labor, focusing on the six-stage theory of sociocultural change that lies in the background of Durkheim's well-known contrast between the ideal types of mechanical and organic solidarity. Durkheim's characterization of each stage is described in terms of its structural-functional differentiation and religious unity. The Division's evolutionary theory, which underlies much of Durkheim's mature work, is criticized for its dated ethnographic evidence, and contrasted with alternative evolutionary proposals, including that of sociobiology. EMILE DURKHEIM'S THE DIVISION OF LABOR IN SOCIETY remains an enigmatic classic. The subject of diverse interpretative schemes (Alpert 1939; Bellah 1973; Giddens 1971, 1972; LaCapra 1972; Lukes 1972; Nisbet 1965, 1974; Parsons 1949, 1960, 1974; Tiryakian 1962; Wallwork 1972), the book continues to elude-by overflowing-the various frameworks used to describe it. Yet the importance of The Division for understanding Durkheim's seminal contributions to anthropology and sociology can scarcely be gain- said. Even Parsons's influential early construal of the book's thesis in The Structure of Social Action (1949[1937]:301-470) as a definitively formulated "first position" that was subsequently withdrawn has itself been repudiated (Parsons 1975:107-109). Most recent interpeters are in agreement that The Division is the seedbed of virtually everything Durkheim wrote (LaCapra 1972:80; Bellah 1973:xxiii), but disagreements persist about the ways in which it is germinative. In few areas is the continuity between The Division and Durkheim's own later works clearer than in his lifelong preoccupation with structural functional differentiation (Parsons 1960) and the relationship of religion to social struc- ture and solidarity. But heretofore there has been no careful exploration of the precise stages of structural functional differentiation in The Division, much less an assessment of the relationship of these stages and the causal theory that explains them to Durkheim's later cross-cultural studies. I seek to provide a fresh angle of vision on The Division by focusing on the finely tuned theory of structural functional differentiation -and the role of religion within it -that lies at the heart of its evolutionary approach to macrosocial comparative studies. The result is a reading of the book that uncovers a number of societal stages between the now famous dichotomous contrast between mechanical solidarity in simple societies and organic solidarity in advanced societies. As we shall see, The Division's latent thesis is much richer in its descriptive detail about different types of society than other ERNEST WALLWORK is Associate Professor, Department of Religion, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13210.

Nor is Durkheim guilty, as some critics allege (Barnes 1966:168-169; LaCapra 1972:104-119), of indiscriminately lumping ancient Israel, Greece, and Rome among primitive societies characterized by mechanical solidarity. Rather, six distinct types of society are distinguished in The Division in terms of their structural functional organization and religious unity. These six societal types along the Western branch of the tree of evolution (Durkheim 1964[1893]:141, n. 21')- and Durkheim is only concerned with tracing occidental social history in The Division-are (1) the horde, (2) the tribe composed of clans, (3) the tribal confederation, (4) the ancient city-state, (5) medieval society, and (6) the modern in- dustrial nation. This typology is first clearly explicated only in The Rules of the Sociological Method (1964[1895]:82-84), but the stages presented there are obviously based on The Division (1964[1893]:174-192). Throughout The Division, summary statements like the following indicate the stage theory being employed: "If we compare tribes devoid of all central authority with centralized tribes, and the latter to the city, the city to feudal societies, feudal societies to present societies, we follow, step by step, the principal stages of development whose general march we have just traced" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:222). The five stages mentioned in this passage are stretched to six by Durkheim's inclusion of the horde as the first stage (1964[1893]:174). Durkheim refers to the first three of these six stages in his evolutionary scheme as ex- amples of "mechanical solidarity." The last three stages illustrate "organic solidarity." These terms have obscured the six stages, because Durkheim is not as clear as he should be about what he means when he refers to mechanical and organic solidarity as "ideal types" (1964[1893]:174). Only the hypothetical societies at either end of the evolutionary tree represent the ideal types, mechanical and organic solidarity. Among known societies, there is none in which both types of integration are not present: "they are two aspects of one and the same reality" (Durkheim (1964[1893]:129). Nevertheless, Durkheim claims that we may legitimately refer to a given society as being integrated on the basis of mechanical or organic solidarity if we can establish that one of these forms of cohesion predominates over the other in operationally insuring the solidarity of the group under consideration. Lewis Henry Morgan's Ancient Society (1963[1877]) which Durkheim relies on heavily in The Division, similarly combines a dichotomous contrast between two general types of societies with a more finely differentiated series of evolu- tionary stages, progressing from a societal stage approximating one ideal type to one ap- proximating the other. Progress in Durkheim's six-stage evolutionary theory is measured by increased struc- tural functional complexity. Each stage is formed by a union of societies of the preceding type or types. However, a new societal stage is something more than the sum of its parts, just as it is in modern developmental psychology (Piaget 1960:13-15). "A group which succeeds another is not simply a prolongation of the latter with some newly acquired characteristics; it is qualitatively different from it, having gained some properties and lost others. It constitutes a new individuality . . ." (Durkheim 1964[1893]19). The principal evidence of a stage change is structural, as new institutions arise to specialize in recently isolated functions. But structural change is dependent on a prior functional differentia- tion that the new institution both externally manifests and consolidates. In Durkheim's words (1888a:44-45), "structure presupposes function and derives from it . . .The structure is the function consolidated." What societal stages really mark, then, is the degree of structural functional differentiation. The form of religious unity changes step by step with these structural functional trans- formations, making its own contribution to the individuality of the stages. Development</page><page sequence="3">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 45 is identified by contraction and generalization of primitive religious culture. The all- pervasive, emotionally intense, and extremely detailed "common conscience" of primitive societies gradually gives way at each stage to beliefs and practices that are both fewer in number and more abstract. The concrete objects of worship in earlier societies are per- sonalized and spiritualized. The beliefs and practices required of the faithful are reduced to the essential core of the tradition. The individual is progressively freed from domina- tion by the collectivity until individualism is itself celebrated by religious symbolism in modernity. Alongside the process of contraction and generalization at the macrosocial level, the newly differentiated subgroups assume some of the specialized religious func- tions formerly fulfilled by the entire society. Identification of these six structural-religious stages, obviously important for accurate interpretation of The Division of Labor, is equally crucial for appreciating the links that tie Durkheim's entire corpus together. Nisbet (1966:86) and other interpreters of Durkheim's allegedly conservative social theory to the contrary (Zeitlin 1968; Mayes 1980), Durkheim never abandoned the evolutionary theory in his first book. Rather, each of his more specialized later studies of the history of the family, education, occupational groups, the state, socialism, contract, penal law, property, and, above all, religion presuppose and further contribute to the six-stage evolutionary thesis of The Division of Labor regarding structural functional differentiation from a primitive homogenous clan. An equally important consequence of the stage interpretation offered here is the con- tinuity (as well as the discontinuity) it uncovers in Durkheim's work on religion. Contrary to the apparent implication of Durkheim's own disclaimer (Deploige 1911:402-403) regarding an early appreciation of the fundamental importance of religion in society, which Lukes (1972:63), for one, accepts at face value, the present interpretation demonstrates Durkheim's early recognition of the functional significance of religion. As early as 1886, Durkheim realized that religion is a ubiquitous feature of social life, an- ticipating his more famous, later claim (1965[1912]:474) that "there is something eternal in religion." "So long as there are men who live together," Durkheim wrote seven years before The Division was published (1886:60), "there will be a common faith among them." Throughout his early articles (1886:65-69; 1888a:41-55) Durkheim repeatedly mentions religion alongside morality and law as one of the principal social facts. In this theoretical light, the changing role played by religion in Durkheim's intepretation of social evolution in The Division and subsequently is clearly a theme worthy of more careful analysis than it has received to date in the secondary literature. I believe the six-stage analysis of The Division in this article meets the tests of detail and coherence by making sense of much that is otherwise baffling not only in The Divi- sion but also in Durkheim's larger corpus. My main aim here is to correctly expound Durkheim's own views on both the nature of the stages and the principal sources of social change. But I also refer occasionally to some of the most striking points of agree- ment and disagreement between Durkheim's account and subsequent empirical and theoretical work. It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully assess the adequacy of Durkheim's evolutionary theory. However, I believe, for reasons that can only be sug- gested here, that his basic paradigm is highly suggestive with respect to the issue of "biology and culture" that is currently being debated by anthropologists in the aftermath of the initial phase of the sociobiology debate (see Barkow 1978; Beall and Goldstein 1981; Caplan 1978; Durham 1979; Heyer 1982; Kings College Sociobiology Group 1982; Lundsden and Wilson 1981; Polgar 1975; Wiegele 1982; Wilson 1975). The following scheme has been extracted solely from the 1893 edition of The Division of Social Labor. The stages and sources of change are described in detail on the following pages in order to provide an accurate map to the book as well as a sufficiently nuanced basis for accurate assessment of the theory.</page><page sequence="4">46 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 THE HORDE The simplest and earliest society in The Division is the horde (or band), a purely hypothetical construct postulated at the dawn of history by extrapolating backward from the simplest clan (see Durkheim 1964[1893]:174-181; 1964[1895]:82-83). An aggregate directly composed of individuals, the horde does not include elementary groups more simple than itself, and it is not a subsystem within any larger group. The horde, in other words, is a single, self-sufficient social unit that develops at the next stage into a clan, which is in turn both subdivided into families and joined within a larger tribe. The horde is Durkheim's "ideal type" of mechanical solidarity (1964[1893]:174), that is, a social system characterized by an all pervasive and emotionally powerful common conscience. Because social components of the primitive's "conscience" predominate pro- portionally and emotionally over individual components, individualism scarcely exists.2 When individual differences are expressed in the form of deviant behavior, repressive sanctions are brought into play. With everyone constrained to think and act alike, members perform the same social tasks, that is, there is negligible occupational differen- tiation, though there may be some along age or sex lines. Solidarity in the horde, as in the next two societal types, is based on the fact that individuals resemble and like each other because they believe in the same religious objects and moral norms, feel the same collec- tive sentiments, and perform similar functions. The term "mechanical solidarity" is employed to describe consensus under these conditions, not because unity is produced by mechanical or artificial means, but because social coherence is analogous to the solidarity of like elements or similar molecules in physical bodies. In other words, "mechanical solidarity" calls attention to the fact that individuals resemble and hence like each other, resemblance being due to the psychological similarity that results from sharing identical beliefs and norms. What Durkheim says about religion in the primitive horde is by necessity rather vague, given the absence of any empirical data. But this general account is theoretically impor- tant as the postulated first stage out of which later religions are thought to arise. In the beginning, religion is said to be all pervasive in its fusion with morality, law, and other forms of social life that are later differentiated from it. "Religion comprises all, extends to all. It contains in a confused mass, besides beliefs properly religious, morality, law, the principles of political organization, and even science, or at least what passes for it" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:135). Besides being pervasive, religious beliefs are emotionally vital inasmuch as they are shared by everyone and reaffirmed by collective gatherings and vigorous repression of dissent. Morality and law are also strongly held by virtue of being infused with inviolable sacredness, but they are not really distinguishable from religion. The absence in the horde of written law promulgated by a differentiated political authority (Durkheim 1888a:42, 1964[1893]:64-65, 68-69) suggests that Durkheim's con- ception of "repressive law," as an external index of mechanical solidarity that is em- pirically observable in the positivist sense, is drawn from a much later stage of societal development. If so, the latent stage scheme in The Division may be employed to meet Barnes's criticism (1966:168-169) that the ethnographic evidence does not support Durkheim's thesis that primitive societies are characterized by repressive law. The absence of any codified law or even differentiated political institutions in the simplest societies indicates that repressive law cannot be a reliable index of "the common con- science" in the earliest stages of Durkheim's evolutionary scheme, and it is a matter of record, as Barnes (1966:168-169) notes, that Durkheim took his evidence on legal codes from the more advanced urban societies of the ancient Near East, not from simple bands or tribal societies. There is considerable tension in The Division between Durkheim's general proposition</page><page sequence="5">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 47 that social repression decreases with greater societal complexity, on the one hand, and his acknowledgement, on the other, that "the action of the common conscience is stronger when it is exercised, not in a diffuse manner, but through the medium of a defined organ," such as the state, which does not come into existence until a later evolutionary stage. The latter view is more accurate with respect to the earliest societal stages. In a study of 48 societies, Freeman and Winch (1957:461, 463) conclude that repression in the form of punishment by governmental action tends to increase with social complexity, at least for awhile. More broadly, Bellah (1970:29) points out that it is the fluidity and flex- ibility of primitive religion ("The Dreaming" in Stanner's account), not its detailed prescriptiveness and harsh sanctions, that is responsible for the stability of these societies. In other words, Durkheim appears to be correct about the pervasiveness of religion in the primitive case as well as its tenacious resistance to significant innovation, but he appears to be wrong insofar as he implies that repression and detailed prescriptiveness are to be found within the simplest hunting and gathering bands. The earliest religion in Durkheim's account is a form of animism. "In the beginning, the gods are not distinct from the universe, or rather there are no gods, but only sacred beings, without their sacred character being related to any external entity as their source" (1964[1893]:288). According to this account, which anticipates Durkheim's classic argu- ment in The Elementary Forms (1965[1912]:52) that religion has to do with "sacred things" and not necessarily with God or gods, primitive religions are oriented to a single cosmos; they know nothing of a wholly different, transcendent world. The spirits are in concrete objects, as Frankfort's (1949:16-30) well-known description of mythopoeic thought also stresses. The primitive's environment, Durkheim writes, is made up of beings of all sorts who fill the social horizon. The states of conscience representing it then have the same character. First, they are related to precise objects, as this animal, this tree, this plant, this natural force, etc. Then, as everyone is related to these things in the same way, they affect all consciences in the same way . . ., and, consequently, the common conscience has a defined character. [Durkheim 1964(1893):287] Just as religious objects are concrete, the norms legitimated by them are precisely for- mulated. "In lower societies, the very external form of conduct is predetermined even to the details. The way in which man must eat, dress in every situation, the gestures he must make, the formulae he must pronounce, are precisely fixed" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:287). The four principal characteristics of primitive religion, then, are its pervasiveness, emotional intensity, concreteness, and precise regulation. Interestingly, in light of Durkheim's later work, there is hardly any acknowledgement of the importance of ritual in sustaining these characteristics of the shared symbol system or any attempt to distin- guish between the lack of individuality in certain kinds of rituals, for example, and the individual's profane sense of himself as clearly distinct from others in ordinary life (see Evans-Pritchard 1965:88ff.). Progress in the religious sphere is measured by Durkheim in terms of contraction (alongside structural differentiation) of the primitive religious con- sciousness together with its emotional weakening, generalization, and permissiveness regarding freedom of thought and action. THE SIMPLE CLAN-BASED TRIBE The second evolutionary stage in The Division is marked by the appearance of tribes formed by a simple combination of hordes, which have become clans (1964[1893]: 175-177). A clan is a horde that has ceased to be independent by becoming an element in a larger group, formed of like segments. Examples of these "simple polysegmental" societies, as they are labeled in The Rules (1964[1895]:84), include certain Iroquois and Australian tribes, the ancient Hebrews in the Pentateuch, and the first forms of the Athenian phratry</page><page sequence="6">48 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 and the Roman curia (Durkheim 1964[1893]:177). The clan is a kinship group with self- sufficient religious, political, and economic functions. Within it, solidarity is maintained by real or fictitious consanguinity. Actual blood relatedness lies at the basis of these ties, but real consanguinity is less important (as the frequent adoption of aliens illustrates) than shared beliefs about a common origin and possession of the same name (Durkheim 1964[1893]175-177). Clans are joined in tribes, which are similarly based on myths regarding blood relatedness. For instance, "the Iroquois . . . treat each other . . . as brothers or as cousins" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:176). Several major developments at this stage start structural functional differentiation. In the first place, the separate clans, while remaining very much alike, develop distinguishing characteristics. Each clan acquires "its own features and is thereby distinguished from others...; without this, they would lose themselves in each other and be effaced" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:177). In advanced forms of this societal type, former territorial clan segments specialize in particular functions. Second, nomadic clans of hunters and shepherds composed of single lineages settle in a particular territory (Durkheim, 1964[1893]:183), as Chang's (1958) research on early agricultural villages confirms. Identification with a common agricultural region or village subsequently becomes an added basis of social integration alongside consanguinity. Third, the first distinct political authority emerges in the person of the chief (Durkheim 1964[1893]:177, 179-181, 195-196). Durkheim was apparently unaware of the diverse forms of political leadership in simple societies, but he avoids taking a clear position, nonetheless, on whether the chief is temporary or permanent, a shaman or warrior, head- man in a council or solitary individual. What is clear is that the first political leaders arose in response to external dangers, especially wars (Durkheim 1964[1893]:177) and gained their authority by means of religious legitimation (cf. Weber 1963 [1922]; Parsons 1966:44-50). In Durkheim's view, the chief acquires the superhuman aura (dare we say, "charisma") formerly invested in the diffuse common conscience (1964[1893]: 195-196). But Durkheim (1964[1893]:196) also mentions pragmatic sources of legitima- tion, such as Dixon (1948:272) and Holmberg (1950:59-60) discuss. Durkheim acknowl- edges that the chief may eventually become a tyrant, as in oriental despotism, but he chooses to emphasize the chiefs newly won autonomy as the first positive step in the direc- tion of individualism. Chiefs are, in fact, the first personalities who emerge from the social mass. Their exceptional situ- ation, putting them beyond the level of others, gives them a distinct physiognomy and according- ly confers individuality upon them. In dominating society, they are no longer forced to follow all of its movements. Of course, it is from the group that they derive their power, but once power is organized, it becomes autonomous and makes them capable of personal activity. A source of in- itiative is thus opened which had not existed before then. There is, hereafter, someone who can produce new things and even, in certain measure, deny collective usages. Equilibrium has been broken. [Durkheim 1964(1893):195] The presence of a semiautonomous political institution improves the capacity of these societies to adapt to their environment. Religion in this second societal type shares the general characteristics of horde animism, since Durkheim extrapolated backward from it to the religion of the most primitive society. But Durkheim is clearer about identifying totemism with clan-based religion, thereby linking the religious symbolism with the kinship system, which many an- thropologists hold to be a universal feature of primitive religion even if totemism is not (Goldenweiser 1965[1917]:70). "The animals or plants of the species which serve as a clan-totem are the objects of worship," Durkheim wrote in 1893 (1964:288). And the totem provides the religious consciousness of consanguinity. Durkheim thus anticipates his later argument that totemism and a clan segmentary system imply one another, even</page><page sequence="7">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 49 that clansmen express their moral identity and feelings of dependence on one another and on their group by means of totemic symbols. Unfortunately, Durkheim was mistaken about the linkage of totemism with clan-based structures. As Evans-Pritchard points out, "there are peoples with clans and no totems, and peoples with totems and no clans" (1965:67). In fact, it is no longer accepted that the primitiveness of a social system assures the primitiveness of the form of religion associated with it (Goldenweiser 1965[1917]:69-70; Evans-Pritchard 1965:48-77). An apparent development beyond horde animism connected with totemism is belief in the descent of clans from a common tribal ancestor. Because clans are related by kinship through a primal founder or father, anthropomorphic concepts are added to totemic im- agery: Not only has the clan consanguinity as its basis, but different clans of the same people are often considered as kin to one another .... Among the Jews, who present . . . the most characteristic traits of the same social organization, the ancestor of each of the clans which compose the tribe is believed to be descended from the tribal founder, who is himself regarded as one of the sons of the father of the race. [Durkheim 1964[1893]:176). This appearance of a sacred person in the form of a great ancestor marks an important step in the direction of spiritualization and transcendence of formerly concrete religious objects (Durkheim 1964[1893]:288). THE TRIBAL CONFEDERATION The third societal type is scarcely distinguishable as anything more than an advanced stage of the second tribal type in The Division (1964[1893]:177-178, 182-183, 185-186), although it is clearly a third type in The Rules (1964[1895]:84), where it is clumsily described as "the polysegmental society simply compoundeQ." This more advanced socie- tal type appears when tribes begin to assume differentiated functions within the larger confederacy. The Levites, for example, assumed sacerdotal responsibilities within the larger confederacy of ancient Israel. With this rudimentary division of labor (Durkheim 1964[1893]:182), the first glimmerings of organic solidarity, with its characteristic feature of functionally interdependent social units, appears. In this way, "classes and castes . . . arise from the multitude of occupational organizations being born amidst the pre-existing familial organization" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:182). With the appearance of a clearly stratified society, each class or caste develops its own morality, "so that morality is diversified with social conditions" (Durkheim 1887b: 123). Initially, the new organization by function makes use of the mostly territorially based kinship groupings, but a tension now arises between this fixed, immutable kinship structure and the steady growth of specialized functions in complex interrelationship with other functional requirements (see Parsons 1966:22 for a similar view). With the greater complexity of organization, morality, and interdependent activity, the spirits or demigods are released from their former identification with the concrete ob- jects within which they are thought to reside. They are no longer permanently associated with "the things of which they were first only the attributes" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:288). Spirits or gods, "while residing here or there as preferred, nevertheless exist outside of the particular objects to which they are specifically attached" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:288). The spirits become less concrete, though they are still "immanent in the world." Precisely why this development occurs alongside the forgoing structural changes is nowhere in- dicated, beyond the theoretical assertion that new religious beliefs reflect structural alterations (1886:67). But Durkheim anticipates here Parsons's (1966:22-23) argument that differentiation poses new problems of integration and that the "value pattern must be couched at a higher level of generality in order to legitimize the wider variety of goals and functions of its sub-units" (see Durkheim 1964[1893]:287).</page><page sequence="8">50 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 Curiously, the monolatry (or worship of one god) within the ancient Hebrew con- federacy is totally ignored by Durkheim, himself a Jew. The cult of ancient Israel is assimilated to an exceedingly primitive religious type, largely because Durkheim locates the evolutionary stage of a society by its social structure and the Hebrew confederacy was not particularly advanced from this perspective. In contrast with Weber's emphasis on the prophetic breakthrough from monolatry to monotheism, Durkheim (1964[1893]: 138-140) stresses the detailed, sacrosanct, and repressive character of the command- ments contained in the last four books of the Pentateuch (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). The decisive cultural breakthrough in the direction of transcendence in Western civilization is attributed by Durkheim, as it was by his teacher Fustel de Coulanges (1955[1864] :390-396), to Christianity rather than to Judaism. His grounds are apparently that Christianity is structurally as well as ideologically a transethnic religion. That is, the inclusiveness of the Christian church breaks with the particularistic ethnic character of Judaism, which is a point Max Weber (1962[1921]:109) also stressed. This emphasis on the distinctive contribution of Christianity to Western beliefs and moral values continues throughout Durkheim's corpus (see 1938[1905]), but in his later writings it is less closely tied to structural developments, such as the urban locus of Christianity, and the significance of Hebraic monotheism is acknowledged (1951[1897]:226). THE ANCIENT CITY-STATE The fourth stage in social evolution is marked by the emergence of the ancient city- state, an aggregate formed by the fusion of several territorially based clans, tribes, and confederacies (Durkheim 1964[1893]:181-186). Cities constituted in this manner are awkwardly described in The Rules (1964[1895]:84) as " 'polysegmental societies doubly compounded,' " that is, they result from the fusion of several societies of the preceding, segmental sort (Durkheim 1964[1893]:186, 281). Sociopolitical unity is now based less on kinship than on territorial identification, as some more recent analysts of ancient urban societies also note (e.g., Lenski 1966:189-242; Parsons 1966:75-76). The principal sub- divisions are territorial districts (curiae, communes, for example), not familial groupings like gentes or clans (Durkheim 1964[1893]:186). These small districts are joined in larger territories (the assembly, the ward, the Hundred) rather than in tribes, and these ter- ritories, in turn, are often enveloped by more extensive units (province, shire, depart- ment) of the still larger society. With these developments, kinship groups lose their political functions and become private, extended families maintained by common tradi- tions, blood ties, and patriarchal authority (cf. Cohen 1969; Lenski 1966:209). As the sociopolitical significance of the kinship group is eclipsed, new institutions devoted to dif- ferentiated functions begin to emerge. Specialized institutions independent of kinship ties establish their autonomy and develop their unique functions within the city-state. Cen- tralized administrative and judicial functions become crucial for coordinating these com- plexly interdependent activities (see also Richardson 1975:330-333). The city becomes the symbolic and institutional control center that recent urbanologists have stressed. In the words of Schmoller, cited by Durkheim (1964[1893]:188), " 'The city . . . becomes as far as possible the ecclesiastical centre, the political and military centre of the surround- ing villages. It tries to develop all the industries necessary for the supplying of the coun- try, by seeking to concentrate commerce and transportation in its territory' " (cf. Weber 1962[1921]:88). The result of these developments is a further advance in the direction of organic solidarity. The group specialization and functional interdependence that began with the earliest differentiation of political leadership and caste occupational assignments finds a</page><page sequence="9">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 51 particularly fertile bed in the urban ethos, with its greater material and moral need for the increased production of a cooperative division of labor. Although the roots of organic solidarity extend back to the simplest known societies, interdependent specialization real- ly begins to flourish once it hits the economic arena, as it did in the ancient city-state. However, the territorial identity of the new group also means that the segmental struc- ture continues to be maintained. Because inhabitants settle within the ciy according to their occupations, "each body of workers is like a city which leads its own life" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:188). Organic solidarity only begins to be freed of its territorial basis during the modern period, and then incompletely, as contemporary political divisions clearly at- test. Religion in the city-state is a more complex phenomenon than in clans and tribes. In the first place, the older family-based religions persist in the heart of the more complexly differentiated societies. But those cults (ancestor worship is a prime example in the an- cient world) are increasingly confined to small domestic circles and removed from collec- tive cultural support. This transformation is marked by changes in public laws that gradually abandon enforcement of domestic religious duties (Durkheim 1964[1893]: 156-157). Despite their privatization, domestic cults are forced increasingly into confor- mity with the national religion (Durkheim 1964[1893]:187), a point that needs to be modified in light of the kind of data that Lenski (1966:209) brings forth about religious conflict in the urban centers of agrarian societies. In the second place, the civil religion of the city-state becomes increasingly abstract and, correspondingly, less pervasive in its control of everyday life and less intense in com- parison with earlier religions. Given a more diverse population with different kinship and ethnic ties, as well as local traditions, collective religious symbols and norms become more general in order to include everyone, much as the American civil religion in Bellah's (1970:168-189) analysis provides a highly general legitimation for a religiously pluralistic society. The gods are more sharply differentiated from humans: "Set upon the mysterious heights of Olympus or dwelling in the recesses of the earth, they personally intervene in human affairs only in somewhat intermittent fashion" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:288-289). This "progress in the direction of transcendence," as Durkheim calls it, sharpens the dichotomy between the supernatural and the natural that other observers associate with "historic religion" (Bellah 1970:32-36) and urban culture (Lenski 1970:134; Campbell 1975:1117). Durkheim, however, believes that these developments signal a gradual evolutionary weakening in the intensity of religion (1964[1893]:162), which scarcely does justice to the passionate quest for salvation in the ancient world or in historic religions generally. The state as a separate institution with primarily political responsibilities is more clear- ly differentiated from religion in the ancient city than in earlier societies (Durkheim 1964[1893]:142). In Rome, where Durkheim, like Parsons (1966:25), sees the state achieving its fullest secularization within the city-state structure, political functions were not only early separated from religious functions, they were even subordinated to them, as Max Weber (1962[1921]:209) also notes. But Durkheim recognizes that the separation of religion from politics was never fully realized in this societal type, and, indeed, that religion continues to influence politics into the modern period. In Athens and Rome, the political authorities were concerned only with maintaining those traditions that were believed to be essential for social cohesion: shared beliefs in the high gods and their role in human affairs; the right of asylum; protection of the sacred olives and temples from profanation; respect for the dead; and regular performance of priestly rituals, feast-days, sacrifices, and games (Durkheim 1964[1893]:160). In fact, in Rome "the State did not lend its authority to religion except insofar as the attacks directed against it also</page><page sequence="10">52 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 menaced statehood indirectly. The religious beliefs of foreign States and of foreigners living in the Roman Empire were tolerated, if they were kept within bounds and did not tread upon the State's authority." But the State intervened if its citizens turned towards strange divinities, and, by that, weakened the national religion. [Durkheim 1964(1893):161] If these well-known facts about religion in Rome support Durkheim's general evolu- tionary thesis about the gradual weakening of religion at the national level, they appear to undermine his related contention that medieval Christianity, at the next stage, marks a further debilitation. Durkheim found a way around the problem posed by this apparent strengthening of religion historically in Saint-Simon's notion that the organic apex of each stage is followed by a period of disintegration before the next stage begins its ascent (see Durkheim 1964[1893]:172, 1958[1895-96]:149; Manuel 1965:172-173). This notion of an alternating rhythm to evolutionary progress helps account for the greater strength of medieval Christianity in comparison with Roman religion, but it also highlights the er- ror that Durkheim makes in The Division in treating Roman religion as typical of the fourth stage. The Roman case represents disintegration in this scheme, or, as Parsons (1966:89) puts it, "a crisis in cultural legitimation." Durkheim acknowledges that Greco-Roman religion was transformed by philosophical criticism, beginning with the Sophists, but he argues that such criticisms--which represent the first expression of "free thought" in the West (Durkheim 1964[1893]:161, 285)--would not have developed if structural functional differentiation had not already weakened the hold of earlier religious beliefs (Durkheim 1886:67, 1964[1893]:161, 1964[1895]:71). Since progress is measured by differentiation in the cultural sphere as well as within institutional structures, the more advanced stages of religion are seen as permitting and even legitimating freedom of thought. This is the basis of Durkheim's later claim in Suicide (1951[1897]:157-158) that "Catholicism . . . concedes a far greater place to thought and reflection than Greco-Latin polytheism or Hebrew monotheism." Protestantism is said to be even more advanced than Catholicism, because the individual is both in practice and in doctrine "far more the author of his faith" (1951[1897]:158). These later arguments are in line with the contention in The Division (1964[1893]:171) that "Individualism, free thought, dates neither from our time, nor from 1789, nor from the Reformation, nor from scholasticism, nor from the decline of Greco-Latin polytheism or oriental theocracies. It is a phenomenon which begins in no certain part, but which develops without cessation all through history." MEDIEVAL SOCIETY Two structural changes mark the fifth stage in the social history of the West covered in The Division (1964[1893]:188-190, 289-291). The first historically is the greater dif- ferentiation of major social institutions within medieval society as compared with the an- cient world, that is, the formation of clearly separate institutions responsible for govern- ment, religion, education, and economics. Differentiation is especially prodigious among economic groups, which are now subdivided into manufacturing, shipping, importing, exporting, banking, agriculture, and so on (Durkheim 1964[1893]:188-189; see, for subsequent confirmation, Clough and Cole 1941). Each of these groups enjoys greater autonomy and sociopolitical importance than in any previous society. Whereas in Rome economic groups were poorly organized and too weak to affect the political structure, the medieval guilds developed into strong, autonomous institutions at the center of social and political life (see, for confirmation, Thompson 1928:790-791). The second distinguishing structural characteristic of medieval society is described as "inter-regional" differentiation, much like that discussed by Lenski (1966:203). Whereas the ancient city, with its modest internal complexity, was relatively self-sufficient, the in-</page><page sequence="11">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 53 stitutions within medieval society develop a complex interdependence with surrounding territories and cities. This is supremely true of economic groups. Since the fourteenth century, the inter-regional division of labor has been developing: "Each city, in its beginnings, had as many drapers as it needed. But the makers of grey cloth of Basle suc- cumbed, even before 1362, to the competition of the Alsatians. In Strasburg, Frankfort, Leipzig, the spinning of wool is ruined about 1550. ... The character of industrial universality of cities of former times found itself irreparably destroyed. [Durkheim 1964(1893):188] During the Middle Ages this interregional differentiation by cities with specialized in- dustries remained fairly modest, being limited, except in certain industries, to cities and environs within a limited territorial region. Hence, it was not until improved communi- cation and transportation freed industry from territorial circumscriptions that regional specialization became part of "the international division of labor" (Durkheim 1964[1893]: 280, 188-189, 22). Religion, in order to cover all the individuated persons and institutions within the vast commonwealth of Christendom, had to become more abstract. Christianity was aptly suited for this role with its "God of humanity," who is necessarily "less concrete than the gods of the city or the clan" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:289). In contrast to the gods of Olympus and Rome, who are interpreted by Durkheim as imaginative projections of life in the polis, the Christian deity "takes leave of space; his kingdom is no longer of this world" (1964[1893]:289). Ruling over the minds and hearts of men more than over exter- nally correct behavior, the Christian religion is said to be "the most idealistic that has ever existed" (1964[1893]:163). It is made up of "articles of faith which are very broad and very general, rather than of particular beliefs and determined practices (1964[1893]:289, 163). As a corollary, Christianity no longer represses infractions of minor importance as in earlier societies, "but only those that menaced some one of its fundamental principles, and the number of these was not great, for the faith, in becom- ing spiritual, more general and more abstract, became, at the same time, simplified" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:163). The idea of the human "person" replaces in morality and law that of "Greek" or "Roman," so that tribal and patriotic affections are subordinated to the love of humanity (Durkheim 1964[1893]:290). Precise prescriptions of external conduct in matters of dress and food are replaced by general principles of ethical action (1964[1893]:298). In becoming more general, Christianity also leaves greater room for individual reflec- tion. Many moral decisions in particular cases are now left to the believer's conscience. This makes possible a form of voluntaristic action that some interpreters (e.g., Pope 1973:399-415; Evans 1982:207) believe Durkheim's so-called moral determinism precludes. When God is viewed as far above human affairs, Durkheim (1964[1893]:290) writes, refuting this interpretation, his action is no longer omnipresent, nor ubiquitous. There is nothing fixed save abstract rules which can be freely applied in very different ways. Then they no longer have the same ascendan- cy nor the same force of resistance. Indeed, if practices and formulae, when they are precise, determine thought and movements with a necessity analogous to that of reflexes, these general principles, on the contrary, can pass into facts only with the aid of intelligence. Accordingly, "the individual really feels himself less acted upon" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:169); he becomes a more autonomous source of spontaneous activity. Medieval Christianity appears intolerant only in relation to modern experience. In com- parison with earlier religions, Christianity realized a considerable advance in the direc- tion of individual self-determination, as Troeltsch (1960[ 1911]:51-58) also stresses. This progress in the direction of individualism is evident in the decline within Christendom of the number of acts that were punished on religious grounds:</page><page sequence="12">54 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 The religious conscience of Christian societies, even at the time when the faith was at its height, called forth a penal reaction only when it was attacked by some infamous action, when one at- tacked it openly. . . . Sacrilege, of which blasphemy is only one variety, heresy under various forms, are hereafter considered only religious crimes. The list continues to diminish, thus evinc- ing that the strong and defined sentiments themselves became less numerous. How could it be otherwise? . . . [T]he Christian religion . .. is made up of articles of faith which are very broad and very general, rather than of particular beliefs and determined practices. .... Since its origin, different schools have been founded, and even opposing sects. Hardly had Christian societies begun to organize themselves in the Middle Ages than scholasticism appeared, the first systematic effort of free thought, the first source of differences. The rights of discussion . .. are from the first recognized. It is not necessary to show that its development since then has served to accentuate this. [Durkheim 1964(1893):163-164] Durkheim admits that Christianity has set parameters beyond which it has resisted new scholarly inquiries in the modern period, but he insists, as does Parsons (1967:46-47), that Christianity, in comparison with earlier religions, has been relatively permissive of rational autonomy and inquiry from the Middle Ages to the present. However, Durkheim fails to explain why the tolerant religious pluralism of the priestly class in Rome gave way to vigorous clerical repression of dissent in medieval Christendom. In addition to leaving greater room for voluntary action and rational investigation, Durkheim argues that medieval Christianity permitted a greater secularization of the state, the economy, and other social institutions. In contrast with the alliance of religion with politics and other social functions in the ancient city-state, Christianity is "separated from temporal life much more completely than it was in Rome" (Durkheim 1964[1893]: 163). God, who was present in all human relations in earlier societies, "progressively withdraws from them; he abandons the world to men and their disputes. At least, if he continues to dominate it, it is from on high and at a distance, and the force which he ex- ercises, becoming more general and more indeterminate, leaves more place for the free play of human forces" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:169). Thus, religious and moral functions are gradually freed from "political, economic, scientific functions," which constitute themselves apart, and take on a more explicit temporal character (see also Troeltsch 1960[1911]:I). But the impact of Christianity on secularization in The Division contrasts with Durkheim's own later thought as well as with Weber's (1958[1904-05], 1962[1921]) in- fluential work insofar as the accent is less on the influence of autonomous religious ideas than on structural differentiation. Instead of religious beliefs directly motivating inner- worldly activities, secularization is viewed in The Division primarily as a result of a loss of religious influence due to the formation of relatively autonomous institutions in politics, law, education, and economics. The withdrawal of pervasive and detailed religious con- trol over activities in these areas depends partly on changes in religious beliefs, and secularization presumably would not occur in the absence of a certain "desacralization" of the world by Christianity, but these changes are themselves largely responses to new structural conditions, even though Durkheim seems to have held that Christianity was particularly suited to these conditions from the outset. THE MODERN INDUSTRIAL NATION The most recent stage in Western history is structurally characterized in Durkheim's account by the eclipse of regional or segmental units (e.g., small towns, provinces) to which functionally specialized institutions were tied throughout the medieval period (see 1964[1893]:149-152, 168-169, 181-183, 188-190, 219-229). Liberated from earlier ter- ritorial constraints, large-scale functionally specific institutions assume responsibility for government, education, medicine, the arts, banking, manufacturing, shipping, com-</page><page sequence="13">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 55 merce, and so forth, even across national frontiers. Durkheim is apparently thinking of the industrial revolution and, like Parsons (1971:75), locates its key in "the extension of the market system and of the attendant differentiation in the economic sector of the social structure." To be sure, small shops, services, and local political groupings continue to function within territorially defined areas, so that segmental organization persists even in the most advanced societies. But the essential social functions are increasingly being taken over by specialized institutions that embrace an entire country or continent (see also Richardson 1975:309-310). These large institutions are no longer juxtaposed to one another, but interrelated and subordinated to one another around the state, which, through laws and administrative procedures, exercises a moderating influence over the coordination of these interdependent units. The state does not determine the minute details performed by these institutions, except in the case of local political groups that are gradually being absorbed by it. Rather, the state confines itself to setting forth general laws, such as contractual prescriptions, that predetermine the conditions of cooperation (Durkheim 1964[1893]:212-214; Parsons 1949[1937]:311). Under these circumstances, the effects of social changes (negative as well as positive) extend considerably beyond the particular segments within which they originate. The interdependence of institutions means that "what strikes one strikes the other" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:223), and even small changes frequently have widespread consequences. Individuals within these institutions are grouped, according to Durkheim, not by vir- tue of their relations of lineage, caste, class, or birthplace, but according to the par- ticular nature of their social activity or, in modern parlance, their "occupational role." In Durkheim's (1964[1893]:182) words: "Their natural milieu is no longer the natal milieu, but the occupational milieu. It is no longer real or fictitious consanguinity which marks the place of each one, but the function which he fulfills." Occupational groups subsequently become the principal sources of nongovernmental forms of social regulation and cooperation. A society based on these organizational principles, which are admitted- ly ideal, is said to be characterized by organic solidarity, because each interdependent "organ, in effect, has its special physiognomy, its autonomy. And . .. the unity of the organism is as great as the individuation of the parts is more marked" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:131). In Durkheim's view, societies of the organic type are more cohesive than societies based on common beliefs because each part is reciprocally interdependent on every other and on the whole. However, Durkheim ignores the correlative point that in- terdependent systems are also more vulnerable to breakdown from disruptions in small, but functionally indispensable, parts. The religion of modernity is "the cult of the individual," which consists of shared beliefs, without supporting rites, regarding the sacredness of the human person. In Durkheim's view, this religious respect for all persons, regardless of status, is not a new element in the moral consciousness of humankind but an extension of the basic regard for others recognized since the outset of human evolution. In this connection, Durkheim (1964[1893]:166) states that from the moment that men form a society, as rudimentary as it may be, there are of necessity rules which govern their relations, and, consequently, an ethic. .... Moreover, if there is one rule common to all these moral precepts, it is certainly that which forbids attacks upon the per- son, for men who resemble each other cannot live together without each manifesting to his fellows a sympathy which opposes every act of a kind to make them suffer. Nonetheless, moral responsibility in primitive societies is primarily directed toward sacred beings rather than other persons. It is only gradually, with the decline of tradi- tional religious ethics, that the human person, having acquired greater individuality through changing social conditions, becomes the object of religious esteem and respect (Durkheim 1964[1893] :403-404). As the collective conscience decreases in volume, preci-</page><page sequence="14">56 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 sion, and strength in all other areas, it begins to respect the individual person, who has been successively permitted by these very developments to become a unique personality with autonomous influence in the world. Insofar as respect involves esteem for moral autonomy beyond mere sympathetic "regard" for the feelings of others, a necessary con- dition for such respect is that the individual acquire "his own way of thinking and acting," apart from common corporate opinion (Durkheim 1964[1893]:137). For this to happen, the individual not only must be released from domination by the collective con- science, he or she also needs genuine alternatives, that is, the kind of milieu made possible by multiple institutions. The individual's own ideal under these conditions of modernity is no longer "to resemble everyone else," but to develop one's "individual qualities," to present "a singular and personal appearance," to fulfill one's natural talents within a unique "sphere of activity," to use one's own reason to apply social rules to particular cir- cumstances (Durkheim 1964[1893]:130, 131, 152). Once this ideal begins to be realized, individuals differ so much that the only ideology that can unite them is one based on what they all share, namely, their common humanity. Hence, the only collective senti- ments that have become stronger and more precise are those respecting individual per- sonality. "As all the other beliefs and all the other practices take on a character less and less religious, the individual becomes the object of a sort of religion. We erect a cult in behalf of personal dignity which, as every strong cult, already has it superstitions" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:172). Unfortunately, Durkheim offers little empirical evidence--beyond the success of the French Revolution, such as it was-in support of the supremacy of the cult of the in- dividual in advanced societies. It is even difficult to isolate criteria for identifying this cult, since it is not at all clear whether Durkheim is talking about common beliefs or an institutionalized civil religion of some sort. It is also unclear whether the cult of the in- dividual is always hostile to traditional beliefs, as suggested by the claim that the new cult "is possible only by the ruin of all others" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:172), or whether it is compatible with traditional beliefs, as Durkheim 1973[1898]:53) clearly claimed several years later. It is equally hard to know how to evaluate what Durkheim clearly does say about this cult, since no attempt is made to distinguish predictive statements about the religious cohesion of the ideal type of organic solidarity from descriptive statements about empirical societies. Since so much rests on the hypothesis that the cult of the individual varies directly with the degree of structural functional differentiation, Durkheim would have strengthened his case significantly if he had offered a comparative study of the civil religions and social structures of several leading industrialized nations. Furthermore, it may be true that the freedom of the individual has been increased at each successive stage, as Bellah (1970:44) also claims on the basis of his comparable evolutionary model, but Durkheim seems naively optimistic in The Divzision about being able to predict the future course of Western civilization, at least insofar as societies are "normal." The Divi- sion is also sociologically naive, insofar as the new cult is treated as if it were self- sustaining, although we have Durkheim himself to thank for later stressing the impor- tance of socialization and ritual in supporting, reinforcing, rearticulating, and redefin- ing shared normative commitments of this sort. Most subsequent commentators (Parsons 1949[1937]:308-324; Nisbet 1965:35-37, 1966:85-86; LaCapra 1972:84-92; Lukes 1972:166-167) seem to agree that Durkheim, at this point in his career, failed to appreciate the role of shared beliefs in fostering solidarity in advanced societies. The basis for this interpretation is Durkheim's argument that the cult of the individual, though common to the community, has the individual, not society, as its object. In Durkheim's (1964[1893]:172) words: If it [the new cult] turns all wills towards the same end, this end is not social. It thus occupies a</page><page sequence="15">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 57 completely exceptional place in the collective conscience. It is still from society that it takes all its force, but it is not to society that it attaches us; it is to ourselves. Hence, it does not constitute a true social link. What gets lost in the major commentaries on this passage is the very significant contribu- tion that Durkheim sees the cult of the individual making to modern solidarity, nonetheless. In Durkheim's terminology, the new cult is a source of "negative solidarity" (1964[1893]:115-120). That is, the sacredness of the individual articulated first within Christianity and, more recently, within the natural rights tradition stemming from the Enlightenment preserves social cohesion by surrounding each individual with a sacred aura, prohibiting attacks on, and interferences with, his or her normal activities. The solidarity resulting from these prescriptions is negative, because civil rights, like claims against others, primarily exclude others from interfering with one's life, liberty, or prop- erty. It does not lead wills to move toward common ends, but merely makes things gravitate around wills in orderly fashion. Because real rights are thus limited, they do not cause conflicts; hostility is precluded, but there is no active coming together, no consensus. [Durkheim 1964(1893):116] This is not to say, however, that natural rights do not perform an indispensable function with respect to solidarity. They are as important as laws prohibiting murder, robbery, and assault. Clearly, such laws constitute necessary, if not sufficient, conditions for solidarity, especially in individualistic societies. "The first condition of ... coherence," Durkheim 1964[1893]:120) argues, "is that the parties who compose it should not in- terfere with one another. .. ." But an additional point stressed in The Division about the inadequacy of modern religion's contribution to solidarity is that "this external accord does not make for cohesion" (1964[1893]:120). For positive cohesion to occur, it is necessary that individuals recognize and act on their positive interdependence a moral point that Durkheim fosters in The Division by demonstrating the actual empirical inter- connectedness of persons in complexly integrated modem societies. It is now widely thought that the mature Durkheim sought to attribute to modem societies the traits-collective conscience, moral authority, shared values, community, for example--"that he had first relegated to folk or primitive society" (Nisbet 1966:86). But Durkheim not only continued to profess allegiance to The Division's evolutionary scheme in numerous footnote references in his later writings, he elaborated further on that theory in his lectures on the family, the state, educational institutions, and occupa- tional groups. For example, his lectures on the family trace the gradual loss of the clan's multiple functional responsibilities to differentiated political entities, priestly classes, and occupational associations, as these nonkinship groups evolve in accordance with the se- quence depicted in The Division (see Durkheim 1888b:257-281, 1921[1892]:1-14, 1895:606-623, 1897:1-70; Davy 1931:103-157; Wallwork 1972:80-98). In the lectures on civic morals (Durkheim 1957[1900]), the state is defined as the chief governing authority (chief, council, king, parliament) of a multigroup society, that is, a society one step beyond the single, self-sufficient, diffuse horde or band. In describing different forms of the state, Durkheim clearly distinguishes among tribal confederacies, the city- state, medieval society, and the modem industrial nation-state, as he had in The Divi- sion. With regard to the evolution of education, Durkheim makes it clear that the "dif- fuse education" in primitive societies is taken over by a separate group of priests in the tribal confederacies, and then differentiated into loosely organized schools in the city- state (see Durkheim 1956[1911]; Wallwork 1972:120-130). L'Evolution pidagogique en France completes this development by tracing the rise of medieval education from that of the ancient world, and its evolution into the modern educational system, which is said to</page><page sequence="16">58 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 be characterized chiefly by rationalism, individualism, and humanism (see Wallwork 1972:130-145). Durkheim's history of occupational and professional groups (Durkheim 1957[1900], 1964[1902]:1-31) begins in the city-state, with the breakup of kinship con- trol over economic functions, and progresses through the efflorescence of guilds in the Middle Ages. The collapse of the guilds in the modem period leads Durkheim to predict, on the basis of evolutionary tendencies toward more differentiated societies, that new types of occupational groups will arise in the future. All of these lectures, as well as the mature Durkheim's other essays and books, dovetail with one another and mutually support the view that modem solidarity depends on recognition of the rights of the individual (Durkheim 1973[1898]:43-57, 1957[1900]). Some also propose modest socialist reforms, including collective ownership of the means of production, as a way of directing economic activities toward more just forms of cooperation (Durkheim 1964[1893]:353-388, 1957[1900], 1964[1902]:1-31). Criticisms of Durkheim's alleged social conservatism and ahistorical approach to social cohesion, such as Mayes's (1980) recent article, thus neglect not only the central role that evolution plays in his writings but also the ethical and political consequences that Durkheim himself drew from his work. (For further discussion of this point, see Wallwork 1984.) One of the heuristic advantages of identifying the six stages in Durkheim's evolutionary theory is that they help clarify the somewhat tangled discussion of the causes of the division of labor in Book 2 of The Division. Why do societies progress? The six-stage scheme highlights the fact that the phenomenon to be explained ("the social division of labor") is social differentiation in the broadest sense, not simply modem occupational specializa- tion, as Rueschemeyer (1982:579-589) and Friedmann (1955:45-58) wrongly assume. In fact, one of Durkheim's main purposes is to place the division of occupational labor, which had preoccupied political economists during much of the 19th century, within the broader context of sociomoral development in order to make the important political point that economic relationships are always subject to societal regulation, even under the regime of laissez-faire liberalism, as the enforcement of contracts clearly demonstrates (1964[1893]:211). The causal problem is to explain how the closed, self- sufficient, essentially static societies of early peoples were led to differentiate and then to explain how this process gave rise to an entirely new "organic" type of societal integra- tion. In explaining these developments, Durkheim appeals to certain material changes-in population size, means of transportation, and communication -but it is important to note that Durkheim does not cite these facts in an effort to explain the cultural superstructure. His operating assumption is that a society is always a reality sui generis (1887b:37, 1888a:30, 1964[1893]:106) constituted in large part by shared beliefs, norms, and values. What he seeks to explain is not the genesis of these cultural items but rather how once a simple society exists with shared meanings it is forced to differentiate the functional prerequisites of any viable social system. The stimulus for differentiation is located by Durkheim in intensification of the strug- gle for existence. The earliest differentiation of a separate political authority, for in- stance, is attributed to "internal conflicts or an external danger, such as war" (1964[1893]:177) or famine, that require the mobilization and direction of societal resources. Once a differentiated political authority is called into existence by new societal needs, this effect, in turn, has further consequences, such as the clan's abandonment of its former political functions in favor of increased specialization on whatever functions re- main. The newly differentiated political authority, if it proves successful in war, may also introduce a further differentiation in the economic realm if the collective conscience per- mits the incorporation of the conquered enemy into the tribe as slaves, who perform specialized economic functions alongside the conquerors (Durkheim 1964[1893]:265,</page><page sequence="17">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 59 271). Durkheim underscores how shared beliefs facilitate, delay, or thwart these early social differentiations. Differentiation only occurs "in the midst of a pre-existing society" (Durkheim 1964[1893] :276-277). Only those early societies differentiate that had collec- tive consciences that were sufficiently flexible to permit structural innovations, such as confederations with neighboring tribes (Durkheim 1964[1893]:177, 278). Whatever else may be said about Durkheim's explanation of the first major macrosociological transfor- mations in history, they were due to a convergence of multiple causes. Durkheim's primary interest in The Division is in explaining the massive transition from "segmental" societies (stages 1-3) to "organized" societies of the modern, in- terdependent or organic type (stages 4-6) In contrast with the tyranny of local customs in small territorial segments, the "organized" society is "a system of different organs each of which has a special role and which are themselves formed by differentiated parts." These are "co-ordinated and subordinated to one another around a single central organ which exercises a moderating influence over the rest of the organism" (Durkheim 1893, cited and transl. in Lukes 1972:153-154). In explaining this development Durkheim again cites an intensification of the struggle for existence. Appealing to Darwin's account of how two similar organisms will ex- perience intense competition for scarce resources if they are placed in the same environ- ment, Durkheim argues that something similar must have occurred in segmental societies when formerly isolated members began to interact more frequently. "If we agree to call this coming together and the active intercourse resulting from it 'dynamic or moral densi- ty,' " Durkheim writes (1893, cited and transl. in Lukes 1972:168), "then we can say that the progress of the division of labor is in direct ratio to the moral or dynamic density of society." This heightened social interaction is, in turn, attributed to two factors: one demographic (i.e., a concentration of populations due especially to immigration), the other technological, namely, an increase in the rapidity of, and in the number of means of, communication and transportation (Durkheim 1964[1893]:258-259). Heightened dynamic density is commonly reinforced by an increase in population size, but an in- crease in the population is not even a necessary causal condition. Small socities, like the ancient Greek polis, may show prodigious organic interdependence. Conversely, societies with large populations, like China and Russia, may be composed of largely self-sufficient local segments (Durkheim 1964[1893]:261). Durkheim's (1964[1893]:262) general for- mula is that "the division of labor . . . progresses in a continuous manner in the course of social development, . . . because societies become regularly denser and generally more voluminous" (emphasis in original). Durkheim's opposition to teleological explanations of macrosocial change, which he shares with many contemporary evolutionary theorists in the social sciences, leads him to argue (1964[1893]:270) that the entire process occurrs "mechanically," by which he means "in accordance with lawlike generalizations." But density alone does not cause the division of labor in the absence of a whole set of psychological and social factors that together with density are jointly sufficient. Durkheim assumes, for example, that com- petition increases along with greater social interaction because more producers and aspirants to roles come into conflict, doing battle for the same set of consumers and op- portunities, at the same time that traditional moral constraints and legal monopolies in local segments are eroded. Durkheim further postulates that in the ensuing struggle weaker competitors, if they are not driven from the field entirely, will be led by a com- bination of self-interest and creative imagination to invent new specializations in "a part of the total function they fulfilled up to then" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:169). Durkheim is aware that functional specialization is not the only solution to intrasocial conflict. Other alternatives include emigration, colonization, resignation to a precarious existence on the part of the vanquished, and elimination of the weakest (Durkheim</page><page sequence="18">60 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [86, 1984 1964[1893]:286). For these alternatives not to be chosen, it is essential that members feel strongly tied to the society in which they find themselves (Durkheim 1964[1893]:276) and that the stronger members be sufficiently altruistic to prefer peaceful accommodation to a fight to the finish. In addition, those who are specializing must remain in constant com- munication and employ certain feedback mechanisms in order to continually adjust their nascent specializations to those of others (Durkheim 1964[1893]:276). "There is no other way for one to take over all the activities the other abandons, and for the parties to adapt to one another" (Durkheim 1964[1893]:276, transl. Wallwork). Despite Durkheim's (1964[1893] :233-255) opposition to the economist's notion that the psychological desire for happiness provides a sufficient explanation of the division of labor, utilitarian con- siderations appear to enter Durkheim's own causal account at this point, insofar as the parties are depicted as trying to achieve the best for everyone. In order for functional specialization of the organic sort to occur, it is further required that the society already have a differentiated political authority, since these internal ad- justments require legal monitoring, coordination, and control (Durkheim 1964[1893]:200-228, 276-277). It is equally essential that the authority of the collective conscience has been weakened both by the emergence of a somewhat differentiated secular realm in politics and economics as well as by rational criticism and reformulation of received beliefs and norms (Durkheim 1964[1893]:283-286, 290-291). The hegemony of the upholders of tradition, especially the authority of the elderly in small communities, must also be loosened for significant innovation to take place, and the significance of heredity in the allocation of social roles must be on the decline (Durkheim 1964[1893]:291-328). Moreover, shared beliefs and values must actively encourage peaceful interactions and mutual cooperation (Durkheim 1964[1893] :276-280). In other words, shared beliefs and values must hold competitors together sufficiently to prevent internecine warfare and emigration; yet they must be flexible enough to encourage criticism of traditional practices, significant innovation, and effective reform. In practice, then, Durkheim acknowledges that the convergence of a number of causal factors is necessary to push a stage-3 society toward organic differentiation, although in theory he insists that it is dynamic density that "necessitates" this transition, when all the other conditions are in place. In practice, Durkheim also sees that there are a number of sources of social disequilibrium, such as wars and famines, beyond heightened social in- teraction, that may trigger new functional specializations. Durkheim thus comes close in practice, if not in theory, to the plausible view that sociocultural evolution may be af- fected by a number of possible selective pressures. What is needed beyond what Durkheim provides is greater specification of the precise nature of these pressures in various circumstances as well as identification of the forces responsible for selective elimination and retention of social experiments, some of which may be viewed, contrary to Durkheim, as random, such as genetic mutations. In assessing the overall adequacy of Durkheim's evolutionary theory after over ninety years, what stands out -beyond the difficulty of evaluating any sweeping survey of this sort--is the extent to which the main outlines of his stage theory remain plausible, especially when attention is focused on the six stages that underlie the overarching dichotomous contrast. Whatever mistakes Durkheim was led to make by the limited ethnographic evidence available to him, his criteria of structural functional differentia- tion as well as his choice of stages is remarkably congruent with more recent evolutionary theories (Campbell 1975, 1982; Bellah 1970; Irwin 1982; Lenski 1966; Parsons 1966, 1971; Richardson 1975). Durkheim's attempt to tie the structural characteristics of societies to specific cultural values (especially individualism) is probably the weakest link in this descriptive work, but it was Durkheim (1938[1905]) himself who later underscored the partial independence of collective representations from the structural systems that nourish them.</page><page sequence="19">Wallwork] RELIGION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE 61 Durkheim's theory of social change is more controversial today than his stage descrip- tions, not because it is out of date but precisely because it raises issues of pressing contem- porary significance. Like many current social theorists, Durkheim looked to Darwin for a nonteological explanation of evolution. His assumption was the reasonable one, that ex- planations that apply to all species other than Homo sapiens probably apply to Homo sa- piens as well. For this reason, Durkheim would probably have found congenial the ex- planation of altruism offered by sociobiologists (Wilson 1975), especially since one of his principal contentions against social Darwinists was that altruism is as basic a human motivation as egoism (1964[1893]:415). Nor would Durkheim necessarily be disconcerted by the sociobiologist's contention that we strive to maximize our genetic representation in the next generation. What he would have opposed vigorously, however, is the biological reductionism that makes it appear as if we always base our helpful conduct on calcula- tions of coefficients of relatedness. Against this use of the paradigm of evolutionary biology, Durkheim would insist that human behavior is uniquely conditioned by the sociocultural environment and by learning. It is because human altruism is modified by collective morality that it is capable of being extended considerably beyond kin. Yet, sociocultural systems, though they cannot be explained by genetic biology alone, also evolve. Hence, it is appropriate in Durkheim's view for the social scientist to make use of the paradigm of evolutionary biology. How this paradigm is to be applied to sociocultural systems is, of course, the essential question being debated today (see, e.g., Barkow 1978; Caplan 1978; Durham 1979; King's College Sociobiology Group 1982; Lundsden and Wilson 1981; Polgar 1975; Wiegele 1982; Wilson 1975). Because this question has yet to be satisfactorily answered, Durkheim's efforts with the six stages in The Division of Labor continue to deserve careful study and criticism. NOTES 1 I used the 1893 edition of Durkheim's De la division du travail sociale: Etude sur l'organisation des socidtis superieures in developing the thesis of this paper. Most of the page references to The Division of Labor are to the 1964 English translation, for the convenience of the reader. 2 Contrary to Durkheim's views here, Elizabeth Colson argues in Tradition and Contract (1974) that compliance with collective ways arises not from an absence of individuation but from fear of in- jury. Marjorie Shostak's Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman (1981) vividly demonstrates the sense of individual identity possessed by a 50-year-old woman in a hunting and gathering band in an isolated corner of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana.
