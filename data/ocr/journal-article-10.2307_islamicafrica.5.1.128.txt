The Essentials of Ibadi Islam is a long- overdue overview of one of the  most understudied and misunderstood sects in Islam. Having emerged in  the early Islamic period, Ibadism, a sect that is neither Sunni nor Shiʾi, is  influential today mainly in North Africa and Oman and is rich not only  in history, but also in theology, philosophy, and jurisprudence. Although  several works on Ibadism do exist in the English language—most notably  Adam R. Gaiser’s Muslims, Scholars, Soldiers: The Origin and Elabora- tion of the Ibadi Imamate Traditions—none of them explains Ibadi theol- ogy. Valerie J. Hoffman, whose volume is the first book- length work on  the theology of modern Ibadism in English, has done a superb job in in- troducing Ibadi literature—a literature that “is often very long, dry, dense,  and difficult to understand” (5)—to Western audiences. The Essentials of Ibadi Islam is divided into three parts: the first part  is a long and detailed introduction of Ibadi history as well as of the role of  Ibadism in the development of Islamic thought. Parts 2 and 3 provide an- notated translations of two complementary modern Ibadi theological texts.  In the introduction, the author discusses the origin and political history of  the Ibadiyya, the development of Ibadism as a distinct sect of Islam, and  the distinctive teachings of Ibadi Islam. In the introduction’s section on the  political history of Ibadism, Hoffman lays out the Ibadi perspective on the  early Caliphate and how this perspective differs from that of the Sunnis  and the Shiʾa. The author then moves to discuss how the Ibadis identify with much of  the Kharijite history, which is evident in a theological primer entitled Al-  ʿAqida ʾl- Wahbiyya, or The Wahbi Creed. Hoffman presents Ibadism as a  moderate Khariji sect that emerged under the leadership of ʿAbdallah b.  Ibad (or Abad) who broke with the more violent and extreme Kharijites.  This section concludes with a discussion of the emergence of the first Ibadi  state in the eighth century in the Hadramawt region, the establishment of  the Ibadi imamate in North Africa, and the role of Ibadism in the political  history of modern Oman. In the next section of the introduction, Hoffman provides the reader  with a list of Ibadi theological, legal, historical, and poetical works written  between the eighth and twentieth centuries. This section serves as a great  reference for those interested in early and modern Ibadi literature. The  following is a list of the topics discussed: the status of sinning Muslims;  </page> <page sequence="2"> bOOK reviews 129 religious affiliation (walaya) and dissociation (baraʾa); reward and pun- ishment in the afterlife; free will and predestination; the anthropomorphic  descriptions of God; reason and revelation; the unity of God, his essence,  and attributes; the creation of the Qurʾan; and jurisprudence. This section  by itself is a great contribution to the field of theological studies and is  quite useful for those interested in Islamic theology. In part 2, Hoffman provides an annotated translation of Al- ʿAqida ʾl-  Wahbiyya (The Wahbiyya Doctrine) by Nasir b. Salim b. ʿUdayyam al-  Rawahi (d. 1920). This primer in Ibadi doctrine is divided into seven chap- ters with an introduction by the author. Al- Rawahi’s primer covers many  different Islamic theological schools as well as differences between the  Ibadis of North Africa, Oman, and Zanzibar. In this text, al- Rawahi offers  a brief introduction to Ibadi doctrine as well as a thorough discussion of  many different Muslim groups, past and present. Some of the theological  issues that interested the Ibadis and are discussed in the primer are God’s  unity, essence, and attributes and the creation or eternity of the Qurʾan.  Hoffman notes that the Ibadis retain an interest in these topics as a way to  “defend doctrines that set them apart from other Muslims” (48). The primer  is written in the form of a student’s questions and the teacher’s answers. The theological primer contains lessons ranging in topics from the sci- ence in theology and the definition of tawhid (God’s oneness) to the most  important religious obligation, the three statements of faith, and the  knowledge of God’s oneness through the intellect. Also discussed are les- sons pertaining to the roots of knowledge of God’s oneness, the attributes  of God, and the origin of the word of the name of majesty (Allah). The primer also deals with interesting topics such as God’s attributes of  essence and of acts, the roots of religion, the impossibility of seeing God,  the types and regulations of religious affiliation (walaya) and dissociation  (baraʾa), the six religions and the regulations concerning people who are  not of Muhammad’s community (umma), the meaning of the jizya (protec- tion tax on non- Muslims), its requirement, the goal behind the jizya, and  the limits on a Muslim ruler in collecting the jizya. This section on the jizya  from an Ibadi perspective is helpful for Muslim theologians who are inter- ested in exploring further the meaning and goal of this Qurʾanic injunction. Part 3 of Hoffman’s work is an annotated translation of the seventh  section of chapter 3 and the entirety of chapter 4 of part 3 of Kitab Maʿalim  al- Din (The Characteristics of Religion) by ʿAbd al- ʿAziz al- Thamini al-  Musʾabi (d. 1808). The translated selection of the book deals with matters  pertaining to God’s power and human acts. </page> <page sequence="3"> 130 i slamic africa The Essentials of Ibadi Islam is important and essential reading for stu- dents in Islamic studies departments and programs as well as specialists  in Islamic theology. What makes this work useful, informative, and inter- esting is the way the chapters weave Ibadi theology with the theology of  other Muslim groups such as the Kharijites, the Muʾtazila, the Ashʾarites,  the Maturidites, the Shiʾa, and other Ibadis of different regions. This jux- taposition of the theologies of different Islamic theological schools makes  this work a great reference book on Islamic theology. Not only does Hoffman make available to Western audiences a wealth  of literature on Ibadi Islam and Ibadi theology but she has also managed  to present Ibadism in a fair and balanced way. The Essentials of Ibadi Is- lam does correct some of the misperceptions about the sect and challenges  Muslim and non- Muslim scholars of Islam to rethink their views of Ibad- ism. This book is of real importance as it contributes an essential literature  to the fields of religious and Middle Eastern studies while also filling a gap  in the field of Islamic studies. Not only does Hoffman present us with the  challenge to investigate further Ibadi history, theology, and jurisprudence  but she has also set the path for us to begin the journey into a world yet to  be discovered.
