<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theatricalization of Love Tzachi Zamir of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs (1870) Readers have repeatedly noted the theatrical quality of masochism. The .objective of the following reading of the novel is to take seriously and literally the histrionic nomenclature that permeates masochistic role-playing in the novel and - since the novel's eroticism is in part an autobiographical disclosure on Masoch's part - in masochistic sexuality as such. Masochism uniquely informs playacting. Acting illuminates masoch- ism. That a practice associated with the performing arts and aesthetics is deeply linked with an erotic one is surprising. But it is also initially plausible, given some of the familiar explanations for both. Acting and the need to act have been repeatedly theorized as a craving to withdraw from identity, to express alien desires under disguise. The underpinnings of dramatic acting thus bear a close resemblance to some widespread accounts of masochism. A "primary masochism" is often regarded as responsible for the desire to forego one's identity. Such a drive accounts for the pleasures inherent in self-shattering and, when sexually inflected, the pleasure derived from humiliation games. The overlapping between explanations for masochism and accounts of the psychological appeal of playacting suggest that the masochisti resort to drama is more than an accidental feature. Masochism is theatricalized love. Its loving aspect (and in Masoch, it is love) is one of the features that distances it from sadism (I follow Gilles Deleuze in his view of masochism and sadism as noncomplementary1), as does its theatricality. Masochism is an attempt to orchestrate an erotic relationship into well-defined roles. In Masoch's novel these are not merely sexual encounters but potentially indefinitely prolonged enact- ments of roles. Intimacy is thus organized according to a predetermined script. Masochism involves a complex play on identity. It destabilizes certainties regarding the pretended and the genuine. Like acting, it calls into question our entrenchment in subjectivity, intimating that self- unmaking and self-objectification can be willed, embraced, and chosen as that aspect of selfhood which one opts to disclose and offer as part of erotic intimacy. New Literary History, 2010, 41: 129-150</page><page sequence="2">130 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Venus in Furs unfolds the evolution of a relationship between Severin von Kusiemski, a self-proclaimed dilettante listlessly flirting with the fine arts, and Wanda von Dunajew, a rich, young widow. The couple meet in a Carpathian health resort. Severin introduces Wanda to his fantasies of subordination to women in general and to her in particular. A large part of the novel is a progressive enactment of these gradually intensify- ing scenarios of humiliation. The literary merits of the novel are easy to overlook if one seeks them in imagery, plot, descriptive insight, or quality of dialogue. The novel's import resides in its constituting an outstand- ing psycho-literary exploration into a usually hidden sphere of thought, feeling, love, and sexuality. Masoch is not interested in explaining his characters. His focus is rather on what they do or say, leaving his readers to make sense of the unfolded narration. Given the explicit nature of the events and the obvious way in which they draw on autobiographical material, Masoch's disinterest in shaping or controlling meaning making is remarkable. The character of Severin concerns us on two levels. Firstly, he willingly recedes from his subjectivity into the position of a living tool. Secondly, he proposes a total theatricalization of life and love. Such movements only partially overlap with dramatic acting, yet they can still inform and be importantly informed by it. Being possessed by a character as an ac- tor, allowing a fictional construct of words to enter and overtake one's actions and experience, the overwhelming attraction of this entrance into possession, are on the one hand broader than Severin's role-playing: ac- tors allow themselves to be populated by more characters than Severin's rather limited choice. Moreover, few actors would welcome the wholesale transformation of life into theater that Severin and Wanda are seeking to implement - the exclusiveness and devotedness which they exhibit in turning their lives into roles. On the other hand, such an exclusiveness itself creates a qualitatively rich and intense dramatic experience: an erotics governed by a perpetual role-playing. Regarding the method adopted in this paper, I will favor an analysis of the dramatic experience of masochism over the etiological psychoanalytic orientation that has come to monopolize the discourse in this field (al- though I have already mentioned one causal explanation of masochism, I will not pursue this line of analysis). Puzzling over the question whether the masochist seeks to punish an externalized father or is being punished by the father figure underlying the mistress no longer seems relevant or even rewarding to me in attempting to unravel masochism. Theorizing sexuality by aiming to fathom some underlying blueprint is not our only option, even for those for whom such endeavor makes sense. We can instead return to a humanistic inquiry dissociated from psycho- analytic motivation. By such an inquiry I mean an investigation motivated by the desire to perceive more (rather than the attempt to understand</page><page sequence="3">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 131 when such understanding is itself conceived as transcending what is seen) . It means attending to experiential details, focusing on qualitative features, and resisting the temptation to move on to some underlying "explanation." Qualitative subtleties are not to be dismissed as "appearances" - mere secondary outcroppings of some "reality." Explanation may or may not follow detailed perception. But perception and explanation are distinct operations. The former's significance does not depend on its furnishing data for the latter. I Let us begin with the pictorial sources of masochism. The novel opens with a situating of "Venus" in relation to pictures or statues, besetting the reader with numerous instantiations of the goddess of love. She appears in the narrator's dream before he talks to Severin. The goddess then plays a pivotal role in Severin 's Pygmalion-like experiences with a statue of Venus with which Severin is infatuated. Wanda will be repeatedly and explicitly associated with Venus throughout the novel. Masoch imparts dimensions of ritualistic devotion to Severin's and Wanda's love story by opening the novel with Venus engaged in various forms of relations with a man, and by having Severin deeply drawn into such an interaction (for example, prostrating himself before the goddess's statue in the garden in which the action begins) . The symbolic import of the beloved's deification may be inferred from a consideration of the novel's allusions to Titian's Venus with a Mirror. Titian, Venus with a Mirror, Andrew W. Mellon Collection. Image courtesy of the Board of Trustees, National Gallery of Art, Washington.</page><page sequence="4">132 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Rather than on a merely despotic woman, Titian's painting focuses on a self-absorbed infatuation with the self's own reflection. Unlike Nar- cissus, Titian's Venus does not unwittingly (and then tragically) fall in love with her image, but is breathlessly enthralled by her own beauty. Masoch touches on a salient feature of gods when anthropomorphic- ally described: their self-sufficiency. Titian's Venus, gasping in delight at her own beauty, is indifferent to the cupids watching her, presenting an insulated scene of self-fascination. The relationship between Severin and Wanda both responds to and transforms this image. The painting that the narrator accidentally sees in Severin's study is a "Venus in Furs," a picture of Wanda, playfully handling a whip and resting her foot on a young mesmerized Severin, who devotedly and doggishly gazes at her. The story behind the picture is disclosed much later in the novel. We learn that, as in Titian's paint- ing, the pictured scene between Severin and Wanda had also included a mirror. Wanda had stepped out of her bath and rested her foot on Severin. Both had caught sight of this in the mirror and ardently wished the image to remain, commissioning an artist to paint the scene. It is as if the casual unplanned instrumentalization of Severin as a human footstool had brought to the surface an archimage that was embedded in their minds and which will progressively be realized throughout the story. The intertextual relations between Titian's picture and the anonymous "Venus in Furs" involve a shift in the location of the mirror. In Titian's painting, the mirror is held up by cupids who are industriously creating Venus 's delight. The cupids aim to intensify her pleasure even more by adding one more ornament - the garland of flowers - to an already self-absorbed beauty. In Masoch, the "viewer" of the fictional picture is placed in the position of the original mirror. We look back at Severin and Wanda from the vantage point which captures the scene that they have jointly created. Titian's self-abnegating cupids beautify Venus. But they are not the focus of her gaze. She merely looks into the mirror. In Titian we thus have a discrepancy between Venus's and the viewer's respective perspectives. In Masoch, on the other hand, the viewer's perspective is that of the mirror into which both lovers had stared at a crucial moment of erotic connectedness between them. The tableau is thus an encapsulation of the precise shared vision. That vision is mirrored in different scenes in the novel. It is duplicated when the couple poses for the fictional German painter. It is glimpsed by the fictional narrator who looks at the painting many years later. It is also conveyed to the real reader of its verbal description. It gives the novel its name. The lovers wish for the scene, so beautiful in their eyes, to be fixed forever. Unlike the familiar conceit of love poetry - the desire to have</page><page sequence="5">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 133 a child with the beloved in order to preserve her beauty - we are con- fronted here with a need to immortalize a visual structure of obedience and indifference. Masoch adds a further intriguing discrepancy to this scenario: what Severin sees in the mirror, what he wishes to be immor- talized, seems to be Wanda's beauty. Yet what she responds to, and what eventually is painted, is her instrumentalization of him at that moment. Severin merges with Titian's cupids, finding in the instrumentalized cupids an echo of his desire. Like the cupids, Severin will be painted as a devotee of Wanda's beauty, who is captured in the act of self-worship. Like the winged boys, Severin ostensibly looks at her, not at the relation between the lovers. Yet it is that very relation which the commissioned picture will capture. We do not really know what Wanda sees when she looks at the mirror and exclaims ("rief sie aus"): "Ah, yes, it is truly beautiful."2 The object of her gaze as she is looking at the mirror see- ing herself resting her foot on Severin is undefined ("Es ist in der Tat schön"). Her wonder is intimated by the exclamation, and mimics Tit- ian's Venus's response to her own image. Yet what will be painted is not her beauty in isolation, but will involve Severin's submissive response to her beauty. When posing for the painter, Wanda will be very specific in asking to recreate the precise expression of a devoted, self-abnegating martyr staring up at her. This choreography of love is required once a visual structure animating the relationship has been accidentally unveiled, and demands to be recreated and (re) projected. II Understanding the subtleties worked into perception and self-posi- tioning in the paintings is crucial for the novel's representation of the masochistic gaze and the way in which it underpins theatricality. The visual nature of masochism as disclosed by the pictorial intertexts sug- gests that masochistic theatricality is a dramatic genre revolving around central images that are orchestrated by the characters/lovers. What Severin perceives in the mirror is not merely Wanda's beauty (he does not need the mirror for that) , but his own relation to this beauty. Yet his verbalization of this experience, the way he talks only about her when he looks at the mirror, as if she were the be all and end all of his gaze, intimates a self-marginalization that is worked into the masochistic gaze: he sees himself (he must), yet he will look only at her. What both lovers relate to here is not just beauty. As in Titian's painting, the focus is on the celebration of beauty. Severin's desire to prostrate before statues of Venus registers his need to complete and enact scenes of self-effacing</page><page sequence="6">134 NEW LITERARY HISTORY admiration. An orchestration of such scenes seems to lie at the heart of masochistic theatricality.3 These images, sometimes static and sometimes moving, operate somewhat like structural types. Each successful erotic encounter that instantiates the type becomes its token. We can even note here the precise tripartite distinction of play-interpretation-performance that characterizes theater and the performing arts in general. In conven- tional theatrical practice, we distinguish between the text ("play"), the cluster of decisions regarding its performance ("interpretation"), and actual, singular enactments that can differ while manifesting the same interpretation ("performance"). In masochistic theatricality, the "play" corresponds to some general text on domination and submission, a quasiphilosophical vindication of female domination as manifesting an aspect of the war between the sexes. The "interpretation" corresponds tq the specific "take" on the theme by particular enactors: in Severin's case the fascination with furs and cuckoldry. The "performance" is the actual, living encounters and the way they are experienced. The significance of the "play" - the philosophical organization and rationalization of that which will be interpreted, particularized, and enacted - warrants further scrutiny. It is more complex than what initially meets the eye. In presenting a philosophical justification for sadomasochistic practice, the novel's characters seem to be rambling rather than philosophizing. Men are associated with the fatuous attempt to formalize love and institutionalize it into marriage. They dissociate the sensual from the spiritual. Women stand for the pagan antipode to this "Christian" ideal. They embody the playful and unfaithful pursuit of painless pleasure. These ideals cannot be reconciled. One of them (so the philosophy goes) will inevitably triumph and enslave the other. Cruelty is, accordingly, an essential ingredient in the relationship between the sexes. Severin's progressive subordination to Wanda thus partakes of a general mastery of the sensual over any attempt to institutionalize and regularize passion. The opening scene of the book, in which Severin harshly reaches out to whip a maid, suggests that there is nothing con- clusive in the specific gendered arrangement portrayed by Masoch: the masculine element can overtop the feminine one. The crucial factors here are that of war and the inability to harmonize contraries. If evaluated as a philosophy one would find very little in this. German Romantics seem to have relished the genre. But we no longer sympathize with sweeping descriptions of culture painted through a few confidently eloquent brushstrokes vindicated by some crude metaphysics of gender, race, or nation. If read as a psychologically motivated process, as a ratio-</page><page sequence="7">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 135 nalization enabling Severin to accommodate his erotic preferences by situating it in relation to overarching first principles, the philosophical framing becomes more interesting, albeit predictable. If, however, it is perceived as an aspect of theatricality, the novel's pseudophilosophy becomes fascinating. As a constitutive part of self-theatricalization, the so-called war between the sexes enables the actors to relate to the characters they are about to embody through some broader framework. Practicing self-allegorization in this way enables Severin and Wanda to perceive their roles as expres- sive of a range of meanings that transcend the psychological or the per- sonal. The philosophical framing that opens the novel thus becomes an aspect of theatrical preparation. It is performed in order to facilitate and deepen the movement into theatricalized love. Instead of lying bare their individual psyches through a humiliation play, Severin and Wanda will regard themselves as manifesting something else, particularizing some general pattern. Philosophizing is thereby intriguingly subordinated to the erotic rather than expressive of an avoidance of it. Philosophizing here discloses an acute realization of the weighty challenge of maintain- ing prolonged and awkward role-playing. Severin and Wanda are not planning some brief sexual encounter involving bondage and submis- sion, but pursue a long-standing ideal. Philosophizing thereby assists in overcoming the challenge of turning one's life into theater. m The presence of the biographical self within the masochistic actor plays an important erotic role by challenging and limiting masochistic theatricality as well as by redefining erotic union. To begin with, the presence of the biographical identity peeping out behind the slave is a precondition for humiliation as such. Severin is renamed "Gregor" by Wanda as part of his enslavement. He is made to wear distinct clothing and to address her only through particular hierarchical titles. Yet this new personality, Gregor, operates as an erotically charged character for both lovers only because Severin is there all along, and because such actions demean him. Humiliation - sexual or otherwise - is predicated on an identity being reduced rather than obliterated. "Gregor" is an erotically imbued name because it is not Severin's own. Moreover, each act of such naming is also a pretended ignoring. The coexistence of two identities in masochism is crucial, since the annihilation of the biographical self, Severin's, would render humiliation impossible. Arguably, it is precisely this merging with a role later in the novel, Gregor's actual transformation</page><page sequence="8">136 NEW LITERARY HISTORY into a slave in Wanda's eyes, and the development of her genuine rather than pretended indifference to him, that terminates the relationship. The play is by then over. The complex function of biographical identities in this theatricalized love is subtly captured in the orchestration of the precise quality of the indifference that should color domination. "She asked lightly {leichthin), as though it were of no consequence: 'Do you want to be my slave?'" (163) . Similarly, the "casual" {nachlässig) placing of Wanda's foot on Severin in the painting that gives the novel its name is anything but a genuinely indifferent act. On the contrary, it is carefully staged, hovering precisely on the borders between role and identity. In the eyes of both lovers, she must be cavalier when she uses Severin as a footstool. Yet both retain a vivid sense of who they are within the scene. And the emphasis on the nonchalant nature of the gestures brings out the precise quality sought by the actors, in making the characters seem to have utterly forgotten their biographical identities. Recognition and the desire for carefully structured moments of misrecognition of biographical identity animate also the pervasive role played by stone and statues in Severin 's attraction. One thinks here of the garden scene in which Severin genuflects before the statue of Venus, or the multilayered function of the statue in setting off the first communicative exchanges between the lovers, or the role such statues have played in his childhood, or the numerous moments in which he looks at Wanda and perceives a statue. The mirror scene discussed earlier, for example, is suffused with the presence of a statue - Venus de Mediä - which Severin had seen a while earlier: Wanda's descent into the bath reminds him of the statue. Moments later, in describing the precise image that will get drawn by the painter and ultimately grant the novel its title, Severin perceives Wanda's body as if it was made out of cold marble. The interlacing of the sculptural and the erotic relates to more than the qualitative "coldness" Severin is craving for and attempt- ing to draw out of his mistress. (I will subsequently refer to the meaning of "coldness.") Like Ovid's Pygmalion, the desire to bond with a statue partakes, on some level, of the wish to pass unrecognized. The hypnotic pull of passing unrecognized by one's love object - a pattern itself explored by Stanley Cavell in other contexts4 - is the logical extension of the tension between role and identity built into masochistic theatricality. Wanda will always perceive a faint echo of Severin in the instrumentalized Gregor. On the other hand, stony Venus will not see Severin at all, allowing him to bond in a tighter way with his role. Indiffer- ent as Wanda might be, she will always mar Severin 's self-objectification. Humiliation games will never utterly suppress acknowledging something</page><page sequence="9">THE THEATRICALIZATION OF LOVE 137 of his identity as Severin, thereby reminding both of the theatricaliza- tion involved. Venus's marbleized gaze, by contrast, returns nothing to those who worship her. It enables a deepening of self-theatricalization since it removes the external anchoring of the nonenslaved self. Even with a statue, the subjectivity that remains is powerful enough to be incapable of erasure. Severin is doomed to remain a subject, and an essential frustration inherent in masochism is thereby exposed: progressive self- instrumentalization, however radical and theatrically creative, will never achieve self-effacement. The subject-role gap will always remain. The masochist can only hope to narrow it down. The complete leap into a role can never be made. At the same time, relating to slavery as a role paradoxically prevents it from being humiliating: "I cannot believe that you would dishonor me," says Severin (196) . What is being intimated is that the elaborate fantasies of bondage that Severin discloses to Wanda, inviting and exhorting her to partake of them, are not experienced by him as debasing. Rather than functioning as a psychological safety net, casting humiliation as a "role" absorbs all of the demeaning aspects of domination, allowing the biographical identity to remain unscathed. The question "How can she do this to me?" is asked both on the level of character and of identity. As long as he can transfer the humiliation onto the role, preserving a substantial enough part of his identity in order to sustain a sufficiently involved performance, he can maintain a distinction between theatri- cal and genuine humiliation. "She can do this to me as part of a play that we are enacting." The autonomous, creative subject remains in the background. He is codirecting and acting in an involved way scenes in which a thespian version of himself is being humiliated. Theatricality is thus an avenue which both enables the plunging into a difficult role, and the setting of a safe boundary that enables the masochist to avoid true humiliation. It is thus both a defense and an obstacle that the masochist would wish to transcend. In the novel, and precisely because Wanda is not made of stone, un theatricalized slavery remains a fantasy.5 IV Wanda is aware of the instability of the role/identity distinction. She warns Severin that the transition from fantasy to practice can be rough: "Beware, if you do find your ideal you may well be treated more cruelly than you anticipated" ( 180-81 ) . She suspects that unleashing the despot within her might undermine the modes by which Severin succeeds in</page><page sequence="10">138 NEW LITERARY HISTORY insulating the fantasy. She is right. Once the performance of masoch- istic theatricality actually begins, the neat dissociation between identity and role will give way to a crumbling of the boundary between self and role within both lovers. The first whipping scene that they share shocks Wanda into retreating to conventional erotic gestures. Severin's own withdrawal from the role that he had so ardently pursued follows shortly. Once Wanda orders him to obtain information regarding a handsome prince who attracts her interest, Severin's fantasies of cuckoldry give way to the sobering effect that the mere game of culling information has: 'You take my fantasies too seriously" he mawkishly tells Wanda (200). This response elicits her scorn and her own insistence that the game be played on a deeper level. Unlike previous incidents, in which we sense that she is being willingly manipulated by Severin into co-orchestrating his domination by her, in this particular moment it is difficult to dismiss a feeling of a genuine retreat on Severin's part. Such a withdrawal from the role is anticipated by the anxious thoughts that beset him whenever he senses that Wanda might seriously take part in the play he proposes. It is the voice of Severin's resistance to the role and his unhappy internal submission to it that underlie some of the more subtle moves which Masoch exposes. Even when she is ushered into the role of a dominatrix, Wanda's own erotic pull to the game goes beyond a mere cooperation with a fantasy. The more prolonged the role-playing, the more she discovers that she loves the role in the man, Gregor in Severin: "Severin, the seriousness with which you are playing your role is very endear- ing, and I find the constraints we are imposing on ourselves deeply exciting. I can no longer bear it, I am too fond of you, I must have a kiss; come into this house." "But, madam," I objected. "Gregor!" She slipped into the nearest entrance, climbed a few steps of the dark staircase, threw her arms about me and kissed me ardently. "Ah! Severin, you are very clever; as a slave you are much more dangerous than I expected. I find you irresistible - I am afraid of falling in love with you again." (216) Oscillating between his identities in this exchange is not just a means on Wanda's behalf of getting her way. Masoch discloses an aspect of Wanda's erotics: Severin's role as Gregor enkindles her love for him as Severin. She tells him that, ironically, his submission has spawned her greater admiration for him. His willingness to act out his fantasy is indicative of genuine power (212), and this elicits from her gestures of love and care.</page><page sequence="11">THE THEATRICALIZATION OF LOVE 139 Wanda's confession that she perceives "power" in his submission may be assessed as a way to lure him further into the role by playing upon his jeopardized masculinity. Noting "power" in a man's subjection to a woman can thus intensify the theatricality that both of them wish to deepen. But it can also intimate a further dimension of Wanda's lov- ing gaze. Her finding power in slavery bespeaks her attraction to the role Severin plays with her. But "power" is also manifested in Severin's capacity to overcome various internal barriers that would intimidate lesser mortals. Her domination of him thereby partakes of an internal dynamics of mastery and submission within him. Theatricalization for these lovers means sharing and enabling a mode of intimacy in which character triumphs over identity, role over actor, Gregor over Severin. Moreover, suppressing identity and allowing it to be mastered by a role is not limited to Severin. Wanda, too, needs to overcome the personal closeness, affection, and love that his role-playing triggers in her. The problem with such gestures - the repertoire of normative intimacy - is that they revitalize and foreground the actor rather than the character. They force the loveable slave to recede. Severin reemerges while Gregor vanishes like discarded clothes. Wanda is caught up in a Narcissus-like predicament: the attempt to grasp the image in the pond makes it van- ish. She can only communicate with his "power" - the source of her love - through theatricality. If we appraise as genuine connection only nonperverse forms of intimacy, Wanda and Severin enact a tragic love story, in which evasion on behalf of the beloved and moments of misrecognition are carefully orchestrated when the lovers are dangerously nearing intimacy. Masoch- ism would then become for us a variant of Cavell's "avoidance of love": a mode of role-playing designed to avoid acknowledgement and mutual perception.6 On the other hand, if we relate to role-claying as a means of singling out the uniqueness and particularity of Severin and Wanda, then we must overturn this evaluation, and relate to the repertoire of "vanilla" intimacy - the moments in which Wanda summons Severin back from Gregor, kissing and caressing him - as a fall from the intense intimacy they achieve as mistress and slave. Which is it? A response to this question involves pausing over the meaning of intimacy. Out of the various possible renderings, I will choose only what is helpful to our discussion: its association with privacy. "Intimacy" implies that some dimensions of life will only be shared with few. Inti- macy in love denotes forms of recognition and acceptance of another's body in its nakedness, of another's gestures, actions, history, context, family, profession, sexuality, eating habits, and so on. Intimacy in love also includes private love games, private jokes, and private names. It</page><page sequence="12">140 NEW LITERARY HISTORY is an exposure and creation of a private space and time in which the less revealed aspects of oneself are acknowledged rather than judged. Relevant to us, too, is intimacy's links with the creation of a joint his- tory. Relinquishing intimacy entails, accordingly, a disruption in one of these spheres: a rejection of one aspect or another, a disinclination to participate in love games, a refusal to create a private space or time, ap- praisal rather than acknowledgement, a withdrawal from shared projects. Clearly, Severin and Wanda are intimate in many, perhaps in all, of the above ways. Moreover, instead of choosing whether it is the role-playing or rather the retreat into nontheatricalized identities which constitutes ¿/^intimate space, we can note how the occasional withdrawal from roles suggests an even higher level of intimacy: an attempt to acknowledge aspects of identity that have not been subsumed under one's role. But even if this relationship exhibits unmistakable features of intimacy, what about the quality of the thoroughly theatricalized erotic gaze itself? Severin is seen as Gregor; Wanda is seen as a mistress. Can we truly associ- ate intimacy with a systematical and intentional apprehension of one's lover as someone else? The answer would depend on whether one notes in such a gaze primarily disconnection or rather a willingness to stretch theatricalized intimacy to its limits. The more rewarding dimension of the question of masochistic intimacy is unrelated to an evaluating or a pathologizing of Severin and Wanda. I raised the evaluative question merely to destabilize an overly brash dismissal of the possibility that the lovers are redefining intimacy. The more interesting aspects of masoch- istic intimacy are revealed when focusing on the qualitative nature of the private space that Severin and Wanda create. Particularly intriguing is the play with the boundaries between private and public space that the lovers set in motion, the way they incorporate the public gaze into their love games. I turn to some examples. V Theatricality implies an audience. In many of the scenes orchestrated by Severin and Wanda, they situate themselves in relation to a real or an imagined spectator. Besides the actual readers or the narrator who reads Severin's memoirs (the writing of which in itself constitutes an audience-invoking practice), or the painting left for some future un- designated spectator, there are less oblique ways by which the couple creates an audience. The casting of Severin as a servant, a message boy, a driver, a waiter, a gardener-assistant, and so forth, all involve situating him in relation to other onlookers. Such an "audience" is basically ap-</page><page sequence="13">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 141 propriated by the couple. Onlookers are made to watch a scene that is played out on a seemingly innocent level - a servant carrying his lady's bags - that has an altogether different hidden sexual meaning. Position- ing others in such ways personalizes the look of the other that is only abstractly implied in other private scenes of masochistic theatricality. That others accept Severin's role as a servant confers validity on the theatricality. Moreover, by duping others into co-acting with the couple as role-players, the audience becomes an unwitting participant in the dramatized scenarios: I climb up beside the coachman, mopping the sweat from my brow. A few min- utes later we draw up in front of a brightly lit doorway. "Have you any rooms?" She asks the footman. 'Yes, madam." "Two for me and one for my servant, all with heating." "Two elegant rooms for you, madam, both with fireplaces, and one without heat for your servant." "Show me the rooms." She gives them a cursory look. "Good, I am satisfied, have the fires lit at once. The servant can sleep in the unheated room." (210-11) The footman will, likewise, be recruited several times in the exchanges that follow. Unaware of the part he actually plays in deepening theat- ricality for the lovers by providing recognition and social credibility to their roles, he is doubly unaware of his playing a part in the scenes themselves: "Suddenly the door is flung open and the servant exclaims with a theatrical gesture [!] that could only be Italian: 'Madam demands to see you'" (211). Or: "Early the next morning I stood in readiness before Wanda's door, and when the servant brought up the coffee, I took it from him and served it to my lovely mistress" (215). If intimacy is related to sharing, creating, and sustaining a private space removed from public identities, the enrollment of the footman here manages to both set up a real audience, and at the same time to maintain privacy and intimacy by that very act. Servitude would allow such games with an unwitting audience; slavery would not. When it comes to personalizing an audience for the enact- ment of scenes of slavery (rather than more benign forms of service) it would prove impossible to withhold truth from the couple's audience. The three "black girls" who would tie Severin up and whip him, the "German painter," or the "Greek lover," will all become a knowing party to the particular nature of the role-playing between Severin and Wanda. In such encounters, role-playing will indeed be tinged with a sense of</page><page sequence="14">142 NEW LITERARY HISTORY withdrawal from intimacy. Pleasure remains, even intense pleasure. Yet the loving underpinnings of role-playing seem to recede. Deploying a knowing audience intensifies the acting. But it also erodes the intimacy, disrupting the privacy indispensable for its maintenance. Masoch is thus able to pinpoint a further limitation of masochistic role-playing: personalizing the implied audience of masochistic theatricality deepens the histrionics and intensifies the drama. It is thus an expression of in- timacy. At the same time, the involvement of others undercuts the very privacy that turns role-playing into love. VI The anonymity of the audience in these scenes - the indistinguishable three black girls, the Greek lover, the German painter - deindividuates them enough so that they can function as an audience but not really be acknowledged qua personalities. An acknowledgement of subjects fuller than these nameless characters would jeopardize the role-playing, skewing the disiine tiveness and erotic force of the played out scenes. Furthermore, a turning of the fictional audience from the lightly sketched caricatures that they are into anything rounder would immediately re- quire a deepening of Severin and Wanda themselves, which would blur the pornographic nature of the theatricality sought. The pornographic quality of Masoch 's novel issues from its focus on action, its reliance on abrupt transitions between erotically charged scenes, and the scanty characterization of the protagonists themselves. Our predilection to avoid granting pornographic representations the sympathetic and patient reading we practice in relation to more de- manding works of literature involves various strands, only one of which is their reliance on flimsy characterization (which, it should be noted, is not merely a lapse of pornographic creations, but a condition for their success as articulated fantasies). Yet, Masoch's novel, and in particular the theatricalization of love that it depicts, invites us to scrutinize anew this tendency to dismiss partial characterization. Limited characterization in Venus in Furs is not merely an aesthetic flaw but possesses an erotic dimension. In practicing and sustaining partial characterization of himself and of Wanda, Severin sexualizes the way by which he is narrativizing reality. By conveying hardly anything that transcends the bounds of a struggling slave undergoing deeper stages of enslavement, Severin is not merely being inarticulate, but charges the narrative with an unmistakable masochistic inflection. Masoch is at pains to convey Severin 's literal-mindedness throughout, implying that</page><page sequence="15">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 143 Severin's limited articulation can and might well involve an erotically governed narrowing of perspective. In Severin's narrative, Wanda will oscillate between playing a despotic mistress and a lover. The narrative as such thereby constitutes a refusal: it denies the lovers entire worlds of meaning when they are being dissociated from their role-playing. Through occasioning such an omission, the narrative becomes itself a. kind of masochistic love play. Limited description is, ac- cordingly, not merely an expression or description of Severin's eroticism, but a constitutive, performative dimension of it. We must grasp enough of Severin's personality to experience the sense of an individual being reduced. From then on, however, we can relate to the gaps in the text, the shifts between scenes omitting any glimpses of a nonerotic world, as themselves an aspect of sexualized humiliation. A systematically emptying out of self unrelated to his slavery is an aspect of Severin's experience of inner congealment. His progressively shrinking self-narrative throughout the novel thereby recreates in him the marble- like quality he recurrently perceives in Wanda. Severin's narrative seeks to metamorphose the lovers into statues, into puppets in the grip of a role. Yet Masoch also suggests their unspoken resistance to this self-staging as well. Severin's relating of the events that he orchestrates is permeated by a lugubrious quality. In Wanda we note the careful way in which she tries to extricate herself and her partner from a play that is becoming progressively dangerous to both (upon realizing that Severin manages to sexualize her indifference to his threat to commit suicide). VII Masochism entails an oscillation between the desire to tunnel deeper into slavery and the opposite pull to withdraw from it due to the anxi- ety that one's identity has altogether disappeared in the role. It is this dialectical movement that turns cuckoldry into more than another vari- ant of humiliation play. Cuckoldry is a complex source of fascination and dread for Severin. The introduction of an actual rival lover who may perform as Wanda's worthy partner rather than as her slave is a fantasy that Severin repeatedly finds ways of intimating to Wanda. The prospect of cuckoldry is ostensibly a limit that Severin dares not cross, a modality of humiliation play that is too cruel for Wanda to perform. Cuckoldry is a radically deeper form of abasement for Severin. As a sexualized humiliation play, the desire to be cuckolded implies that in his craving for further humiliation, his identity as "Severin" under "Gregor" becomes insignificant enough for Wanda to take up a lover.</page><page sequence="16">144 NEW LITERARY HISTORY At the same time the lover is not only intensifying Severin's slavery as Gregor. The lover genuinely jeopardizes Severin and Wanda's relation- ship as a loving couple. The actual Greek lover chosen by Wanda is described through con- flating gendered predicates. We are informed that in the past he wore feminine attire and that infatuated men mistook him for a woman. His femininity is not merely an aspect of his history but transpires in the ultimate scene. He whips Severin mockingly, saying that Severin's displea- sure stems from the Greek being unadorned with furs. The Greek lover's partial feminine side emerges as a surprise given the highly masculine way in which he is previously described. The androgynous element renders complex the cuckoldry scene. Severin will be positioned between mock- ing Wanda and her effeminate lover. And while the levels of humiliation are ostensibly clear, Severin's being beaten by the lover of the woman he loves, the androgynous nature of the lover itself reflects the ideal of the defeminized woman, divested of her warmth, embodied in a cold figure that is no longer a woman. Severin's Pygmalion-like attraction to statues of goddesses already bespeaks his fascination with the ideal of womanhood, dissociated from human warmth. The woman that he sees latent in the Greek is a manifestation of the same statuesque and cold ideal he cultivates throughout the novel. This accounts for the intense pleasure that intermingles with Severin's genuine, nonacted indignation throughout the scene. Male masochism involves a distancing from and refusal of femininity. A woman will only be seen as something other than herself, something lacking warmth, compassion, and care that is conventionally expected of her. The dewomanized androgynous lover functions as a physical manifestation of this emotional refusal: a woman endowed with the body of a man partakes of the same ideal object of desire as the woman turned into stone, into an uncaring despot. We note Severin's craving for Wanda's coldness precisely at moments in which the couple lapses into conventional intimacy, when she bestows on him conventionally feminine gestures of closeness and care. As much as he longs for such moments, when they occur he carefully and persistently ushers her out of them. The abruptness by which he does this, suggests that for Sev- erin there is something desired yet unbearable about the experience of feminine caring: "Try to forget yesterday's horrible scene," she says, in a trembling voice. "For your sake I satisfied these mad wishes, now let us be reasonable. We shall be happy and love each other, and in a year's time I shall be your wife." "My mistress," I cry, "and I your slave!" (187)</page><page sequence="17">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 145 Such recoiling from warmth on his part - directing her back into the slave/mistress conceptualization - characterizes many of their dialogues. Severin will invoke his need for gestures of intimacy only to invite or even orchestrate her withholding of them or withdrawing from them. He thus augments such expressions of intimacy into a form of punish- ment. She must be both able to extend such warmth to others (hence the fantasy of cuckoldry) , yet unwilling to direct such feelings to him. Her "coldness" - to which, in part, the furs that preoccupy him relate - is a physical manifestation of an internal lack in Wanda which he projects onto her. She must both possess femininity and deny the nurturing, em- bracing aspects of it (hence, perhaps, the resort to ultrafeminine items of clothing in masochistic scenarios in general), conveying womanly elegance and vulnerability yet precluding Severin from communicating with its more tender aspects. The cuckoldry fantasy in Masoch's novel thus bears upon a gendered aspect of masochistic theatricality. In their insistence on withdrawing from warmth - an essential attribute of the cultural fashioning and expectation from women - the cuckoldry scenes and the preoccupation with "coldness" (or the marble within a woman) seem to disclose an aspect unique to male masochism.7 Wanda's crudest withdrawal from warmth (and also a cardinal develop- ment in her relation to her role), occurs after she confesses her sexual fidelity to him, when role and identity are abruptly reversed: She began to stroke me like a child, to kiss and caress me. . . . We spent two heavenly hours together. She was no longer a stern and capricious mistress but an elegant lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs and books that had just been published and she talked to me with such verve, lucidity and good taste that more than once I carried her hand to my lips, enraptured . . . "Are you happy now?" "Not yet." She lay back on the cushions and slowly opened her kazabaika. But I promptly drew back the ermine over her half naked bosom. 'You are driving me insane!" "Come to me." I fell into her arms; her kisses were like a serpent's. She whispered once again: "Are you happy?" "Infinitely," I cried. She burst out laughing, and her laughter had such an evil ring that it sent a cold shiver down my back. 'You dreamed of being the slave and the plaything of a beautiful woman, and now you imagine you are a free man; you think you are my lover, you insane fellow! I need only make one move and you become a slave again. Down on your knees!" (231-32)</page><page sequence="18">146 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The significance of this particular scene is that the divide between Wanda and her role is overturned. Until this moment, Severin had perceived Wanda behind the mistress. She could withdraw from the role into her old nondespotic personality. Bondage games were merely scenes played out between them. Yet at this particular moment, the loving gestures and shared intimacy themselves become a role that she plays but to torment him further when she drops the caring disguise. The distinction between enacted appearance and reality can no longer be upheld. It is at this precise moment that Masoch adds a subtle touch: the cold- ness is transferred from Wanda to Severin. Her evil and shrill laughter ("ein böses, gellendes Gelächter") triggers cold shivers in him ("es mich Kalt überrieselte"). This is effected by an initial reinstating of Severin's former identity through conventional intimacy. She caresses and strokes him "like a child," swearing that she has been faithful to him. They read poetry together. She ardently professes her wish that he be happy. Yet precisely as she invites him to make love with her and he declares his infinite happiness, she drops the caring disguise, and mocks his presumed manhood.8 Now he is no longer the lover interacting with her through unique erotic games that are potential forms of intimacy, but is himself rejected. His former identity is no longer sought for throughout the play, but becomes an instrument to further his humiliation. Theatricality is exacerbated: rather than playing the roles of mistress and slave, they now begin to play at being lovers. And it is precisely at this moment that the coldness he draws from her flows into him. He feels cold all over. VIII I have argued that masochism involves a prolonged and intense play acting. But what kind of nonsexualized acting does it approximate? The hyperbolic nature of masochistic role-playing - the exaggerated gestures, costumes, coldness, haughty rejection, and hound-like dependency - does not suggest some generalized theatricality. It points, rather, at a more specific form of acting. Masochistic acting eschews the attempt to either particularize or personalize the role. The repertoire of masochistic gestures is fashioned out of visual and symbolic clichés. Like the facial expression of the defeated clown, the attitude of the slave kneeling at his mistress's feet is not unique. He is distinguishable from other such slaves only in the contingency of his physical features. While Wanda can be inventive vis-à-vis modes of cruelty, masochistic acting seems to be confined to types. Being a "mistress" or a "slave" means inhabiting a role governed by an alien set of typical expressive conventions. Creativity in such roles is highly circumscribed.</page><page sequence="19">THE THEATRIC ALIZATION OF LOVE 147 An actor playing the role of a masochist does not have to tunnel into private memories or draw on personal experiences. As actor, the mas- ochist is closer to the expressive world of the mime artist, or the figure of Vice, or Everyman of the morality play, or the Harlequin from the Commedia dell'Arte. The enactment of such roles is not modeled after life. It is oriented at capturing and stylizing a distilled core of the staged sentiment. Here is Declan Donnellan's description of acting set types (he calls these "persona") in the Commedia dell'Arte. In our context, it is interesting to note the deployment of the language of control and sur- render in his description of the phenomenology of such acting: A practical example of persona occurs in Commedia dell'Arte, where different archetypal characters are available to be adopted, inhabited and played by the performer. The actor need not necessarily have done a wealth of specific research on the character of Pantalone. The actor who recognizes the persona of the foolish old man will be able to adopt the persona of this well-known character. Incidentally, the actor adopts a persona; the actor does not adapt a persona. In fact, the more the performer is able to surrender to the persona, the more the persona will adopt and even adapt the actor. It is as if the persona itself has done the background research and lends its findings to the actor.9 Donnellan describes the process whereby it is the archetypal character that overtakes the actor's embodiment in a reversal of the power relations between actor and role. A successful enactment of a type depends not on filling out the missing details that could fully bring the character to life. Becoming a type necessitates a dissipation of the sense of self, allowing the type to supersede and mould one's identity. Such an experience is not unique to acting types. "We speak of the actor playing a role," says Richard Hornby, "but actually, the role plays him."10 The actor's self is thus simultaneously expanded and relinquished. Acting thus offers a mixture of pleasures involving both the delights of self-amplification, but also the overwhelming threat of self-disintegration. Acting as such could be thus construed as expressing and fulfilling "primary masochism," a receding into the Freudian oceanic, the need to - in Cynthia Marshall's phrase - "self-shatter."11 Yet unlike acting in general, masochism is closer to type acting than to the mode of realistic acting favored by Stanislavski- inspired approaches. The reason is that masochistic acting consists in establishing a distance between self and role through the deployment of a visual language that is unrelated to one's "non-acted" identity. Masochistic role-playing is not an aesthetically driven form of refined acting. But it overlaps in an illuminating way with the psychological mechanisms underlying stylized acting. Masochism is a form of sexual- ized type acting. It is centrally about the resistance and distancing from</page><page sequence="20">148 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the role. Concomitantly, it is about the fascination with the role, as well as the willingness and capacity to enter further into it, allowing the role to take over. * * * I have argued that the theatricality of love in masochism consists: 1) Of love relations that shift into role-playing and that represent an alternative form of intimacy. Such an intimacy can be dismissed or pathologized only if one adopts a simplified understanding of "disguise" and of the implications of communication under role. 2) The scenes involve in- viting and yet withholding "traditional" gestures of love and feminine caring. An expression of such gestures, followed by a refraining from extending them is the currency of the masochistic erotic dialogue. 3) Masochism is theatrical in the pictorial choreography of the scenes that are created, sustained, and that regulate the erotic play. 4) It relies on an imagined or an actual audience who, wittingly or unwittingly, becomes coparticipant in the scenes. 5) The genre of masochistic theatricality is stylized, featuring burlesque hyperbolic types rather than striving for the verisimilitude of detailed human characters. Such partial characterization accounts for the limited interest bestowed on the other's subjectivity and the constricted self-articulation of the masochist. A curtailed expression is not only pornographic, but establishes an aspect of the specific role- playing that underpins masochism. It enables the role to overmaster identity if the masochistic actor is willing and able to permit this over- turning to occur; 6) Finally, the particular kind of role-playing adopted in masochism, "slavery" and the withdrawal from subjectivity it implies, is itself an aspect of the phenomenology of acting: the magical pull of self-dismantling, of lovingly collapsing into the object within.

Severin's feverish devotedness, which Wanda insists on capturing in the painting, is indeed static, but it is not frozen. 4 See Stanley Cavell, "The Avoidance of Love: A Reading of King Lear," in Disowning Knowledge in Six Plays of Shakespeare (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1987), 39-124. 5 An intriguing parallel in early modern drama to such capacity of the fictional name to insulate and defend the actor from what the character that he incarnates performs occurs in Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. When contemporary readers wonder why Faustus repeatedly refers to himself through his personal name rather than through the first person pronoun, one thought that comes to mind is that such a ploy enables the actor to embody and vocalize the rituals of denouncing God and committing himself to Lucifer on stage. Lines such as "There is no chief but only Beelzebub, / To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself1 (1.3.58-59) or "I, John Faustus, of Wittenberg, Doctor, by these presents, / do give both body and soul to Lucifer ..." (2.1.105-6) suggest that a directly personal syntax may have been perceived as possibly damning the actor's actual soul. References are to the 1604 text in The Complete Plays, ed. Mark Thornton Burnett (London: Everyman, 1999). 6 Nick Mansfield presents a different reading that dismisses the possibility that the novel explores an alternative intimacy. He argues that Severin's desire is far more aggressive than his submissiveness would suggest, seeking to annihilate Wanda's own, and transforming her into a liberated dominatrix who has somehow discovered a desire deeply buried within her. For Mansfield, Wanda does not discover dominance within her, but is surreptitiously coaxed into it by Severin in an act of prolonged objectification, mirroring back to Severin the shattering of desire that he seems to crave for himself. Mansfield would thus probably deny the possibility that masochism is a form of intimacy or love: "The masochist fulfills his desire by annihilating the desire of the other. . . . The masochisti desire is fulfilled by being extinguished. The other's desire is extinguished by being represented as fulfilled" {Masochism: The Art of Power [Westport, CT: Praeger, 1997], 8). Yet since Wanda repeatedly says that something has been liberated in her, Mansfield must reject her explicit language, dismissing it as an outcropping of Severin's own manipulation. Mansfield may be right. But he may also be exhibiting a form of critical paternalism towards Wanda and a conser- vatism in his outlook that Masoch's novel challenges by suggesting unconventional modes of intimacy. Mansfield's reading might well be instancing the annihilation of Wanda's desire, the very act that he ostensibly criticizes. 7 While female masochism (sexual or not) has been extensively discussed (for example, Jessica Benjamin's The Bonds of Love: Psychoanalysis, Feminism, and the Problem of Domination [New York: Pantheon, 1988] ) and even implicitly identified with masochism as such, I have not found discussions of it in relation to (or as) theatricality. One intriguing exception to this rule is Anne McClintock's discussion of the relationship between Hannah Cullwick and Arthur Munby {Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Context [New York: Routledge, 1995], chap. 3). McClintock ably reads into Cullwick's theatricalized forms of submission a mode of what can be regarded as a subversive political theater. Even in McClintock's analysis, however, theatricality is not a facilitator of love but mostly a means of articulating classed or gendered resistance (perhaps because for some - though I am unsure about McClintock - "love" cannot be dissociated from power dynamics in the first place). Narratives focusing on feminine masochism tend to situate the heroine in relation to male sadists rather than lovers. The latter are more aligned with Sade's protagonists than with the theatrical quality of humiliation expressed in Masoch's work. The most important aspect of discomplementarity between sadism (as manifested in Sade's novels)</page><page sequence="22">150 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and masochism (as described in Masoch) is that Masoch is describing love; Sade does not. 8 The German original stresses the scorn aimed at Severin's manhood even more than the above translation conveys: "jetzt bildest du dir ein, ein freier Mensch, ein Mann, mein Geliebter zu sein" (96). 9 Declan Donnellan, The Actor and the Target (London: Nick Hern Books, 2002), 108. 1 0 Richard Hornby, The End of Acting: A Radical View (New York: Applause Theatre Books, 1992), 57. 11 In his account of the psychosexual basis of acting, Richard Hornby associates the dissipating borders of identity which acting involves with a regression into the oceanic state described by Freud (chap. 2). Acting thus overlaps with religious and erotic states. For the developments in the concept of masochism - its movement from a mere perver- sion into a primary drive and the implication of this for the self - see Cynthia Marshall, The Shattering of the Self: Violence, Subjectivity, and Early Modern Texts (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2002). Marshall incorporates accounts of the self by Laplanche and Bersani that situate it in between the need to consolidate identity and the counterdesire to deconstruct. She argues that the emergence of early modern subjectivity was linked to a proliferation of representations of shattering bodies on the early modern stage. Given the orientation of this essay, I would add to her argument that the boost in the popularity of theater and acting as such in early modern England registers a fascination with suppressing and overcoming one's identity in a public space. Marshall's argument could thus help historicize the self-role dynamics I describe in the context of a broader transformation in self-experience. And while I would not go as far as Carol Siegel and John Noyes in suggesting that masochism is an invention that should be understood in terms of a particular formative moment in European history and literature, I welcome the suggestion that some dimensions of acting and masochism could be profitably understood as historically situated in relation to overarching transformations in personal experience. For a further exploration of this issue, see Carol Siegel's Male Masochism: Modern Revisions of the Story of Love (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1995); John. K. Noyes, The Mastery of Submission: Inventions of Masochism (Ithaca, NY: Cornell Univ. Press, 1997).</page></plain_text>
