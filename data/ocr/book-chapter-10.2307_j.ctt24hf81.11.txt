<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> SEVEN  The Archaeological Record of Early  Austronesian Communities  As demonstrated in Chapter 4, the reconstructions of comparative linguists  indicate that the earliest identifiable Austronesian communities were located  in Taiwan. Prior to the Austronesian colonization of this island, some degree  of common linguistic ancestry with mainland Asian populations (especially  ancestral Austroasiatic and Tai-Kadai speakers) is evident in macrofamily recon- structions. Beyond Taiwan, early Austronesian colonists later moved southward  through the Philippines into Indonesia and Oceania.  These early Austronesian populations had economies based firmly on agri- culture and maritime subsistence, some domesticated animals, and a technology  that included canoes, well-constructed wooden houses, and probably pottery.  The linguistic evidence can tell a great deal about the geographical patterning  of Austronesian expansion and about certain adaptations that took place in the  Austronesian lifestyle. It cannot, however, tell very much about absolute chron- ology or illustrate many stylistic details of material culture.  The provision of information in the latter categories is of course primarily  the domain of archaeology, as the bulk of the next three chapters will show.  This discipline can also provide some information that can be equated with the  record of ethnolinguistic prehistory as derived from linguistics. For instance,  the documented spread of pottery and polished stone adzes after 3000 BC  through parts of Island Southeast Asia is perhaps mainly a result of Austronesian  settlement, although this is naturally impossible to prove in any absolute sense  because pots and stones cannot talk. But such categories of material culture  have dates, typological characteristics, and distributions that we can attempt to  interpret.  To anticipate the following sections, I will set out here a brief version of my  201  </page> <page sequence="2"> 202 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  overall model for the later stages of Indo-Malaysian prehistory (Bellwood 1991,  1995a):  1. The Austronesian-speakers who expanded into the Indo-Malaysian Archi- pelago carried a fully agricultural economy and introduced pottery and a  new repertoire of unibeveled stone adzes. However, woven in with this  agricultural economy were continuing skills in terrestrial and maritime  hunting and gathering. Linguistically, a presence of rice in the agricultural  repertoire seems certain. Archaeologically, the evidence is less conclusive  and I return to this problem below.  2. The pre-Austronesian inhabitants of the archipelago occasionally used  edge-ground stone axes and shell adzes, but they did not use pottery.  While they undoubtedly exploited many tubers and fruit trees, later to be  of major importance as domesticates, they did not systematically cultivate  these species. Had they done so, the present representation of non-Austro- nesian and non-Mongoloid populations in the major islands of Southeast  Asia would, for demographic reasons, be much fuller.  3. Non-Austronesian hunters and gatherers survived in ever-diminishing  numbers throughout the millennia of Austronesian expansion, but a non- cereal agricultural economy might have developed independently in the  New Guinea Highlands before this expansion took place. This could help  to explain why Austronesian colonization of New Guinea was restricted  only to marginal coastal locations.  4. During the millennia of expansion southward and into Oceania, the  economies of Austronesian societies underwent a number of latitudinal  and more localized ecological adaptations. Cereals were apparently re- placed in eastern Indonesia by tubers and tree fruits. Some groups even  specialized away from agriculture in the directions of terrestrial or mari- time hunting and gathering (e.g., the Punans and Orang Laut).  5. During the millennium between 500 sc and AD 500, the archipelago was  incorporated into wider South and East Asian spheres of interaction.  Major introductions or developments of this period include metallurgy  and probably domesticated cattle and water buffalo, together perhaps  with a significant increase in commitment in certain areas (e.g., Northern  Luzon, Java, Bali) to terraced and irrigated rice cultivation. Contacts with  the civilizations of India and China also began during this period.  I. THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE  There is now enough botanical, linguistic, and archaeological evidence to allow  a partial reconstruction of the early stages of agricultural prehistory in China  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 203  and Southeast Asia. This has not always been the case; until a few years ago it  was fairly commonplace for geographers and botanists to offer purely hypothet- ical reconstructions that were always plausible but never testable. One was the  well-known theory of Sauer (1952) that agriculture arose with the vegetative  planting of tubers and other useful plants in the monsoon regions of Mainland  Southeast Asia, especially in resource-rich coastal and riverine situations where  varieties of useful plant species were available for many purposes as well as  food. The literature that has grown up around Sauer's theory is too extensive to  review here, but I must question (without necessarily entirely rejecting) two  widely accepted corollaries of his views. One is that agriculture based on the  vegetative planting of trees and tubers long preceded the cultivation of cereals  in Southeast Asia. The other is that agriculture began in "affluent forager" con- ditions of leisure and plenty that allowed experimentation.  As far as the first corollary is concerned, I accept Gorman's suggestion (1977)  that rice was one of the earliest plants to be domesticated in China and Main- land Southeast Asia. Archaeological evidence from China supporting this obser- vation is now prolific and will be reviewed below; there is no direct archaeo- logical evidence supporting an earlier stratum of noncereal cultivation, except  in New Guinea, an area of only marginal relevance for early agriculture in  Southeast Asia. However, it must be noted here that some of the oldest Neo- lithic sites in Southeast Asia have not yet produced direct evidence for rice (or  for any other domesticated plants for that matter); such sites include Nong Nor  in Thailand (ca. 2500 Be; O'Reilly 1995) and the sites of the Ta-p'en-k'eng cul- ture in Taiwan (ca. 3000 Be; Tsang 1992). This problem could simply be one of  sampling, but the possibility that rice was not universally grown by some of the  earliest agricultural peoples to penetrate Southeast Asia must also be considered.  I will return to this very important question later.  In addition, it is entirely plausible that hunter-gatherer populations such as  the Hoabinhians practiced occasional protection and even some casual cultiva- tion of forest tubers and fruit trees before systematic agriculture began. The  main conceptual difference here is not between totally foraging and totally agri- cultural economies-few (perhaps no) populations in real life occupy such  extreme poles. But a foraging economy with some casual cultivation does not  necessarily carry the same evolutionary potential as an agricultural economy  with some foraging. Those forager societies that eventually moved into system- atic rather than casual agriculture were given unprecedented opportunities for  demographic growth, especially if they grew cereals (as they no doubt did in  China).  The second "affluence" corollary has long been favored by K. C. Chang  (1981, 1986) for China and is currently popular amongst archaeological theore- ticians in various forms for other parts of the world, centered mainly on con- </page> <page sequence="4"> 204 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  cepts of competitive feasting as spurs to increased food production (e.g.,  Hayden 1990; Blanton and Taylor 1995). Of course, starving people are perhaps  the least likely of any to "invent" agriculture, and relative affluence might have  characterized many of the hunter-gatherers who first made the transition to  agriculture. Even so, it is difficult to see affluence and social competition as hav- ing major causal roles in themselves, partly because so many ethnographic  foragers have had such competitive economies without making any transition  to agriculture at all (e.g., western North America).  Instead, the majority of published opinions in the 1990s regard the origin of  agriculture as a reaction to encouraging and directed forms of stress, whether  due to direct demographic pressures on resources or to less specific environ- mental or seasonal perturbations affecting resource availability (McCorriston  and Hole 1991). One very common assumption is that hunter-gatherers will  not successfully turn to cultivation-which intermittently requires higher inputs  of labor and forward planning for land clearance, weeding, and harvesting- unless they are forced to do so by an insistent and growing imbalance between  population size and available food. The ethnographic record in Australia, South- east Asia, and other regions makes this conclusion virtually unavoidable (Head- land 1986; Bellwood 1996b).  This general stress-focused view has always seemed to me to be very plausi- ble, but alone it can hardly explain why agriculture should have developed- apparently independently-in a number of hearth regions in the Old and New  Worlds around and immediately following the end of the Pleistocene. Since the  first edition of this book was published, the whole topic of agricultural origins  has snowballed into one of the biggest debates in archaeology, and of course the  issues cannot be covered fully here-they demand a book in themselves (Mac- Neish 1992 represents one try, but with only limited applicability to eastern  Asia). It is now evident that agriculture in Southwest Asia and perhaps China (I  am reluctant to include other areas such as the Americas) evolved amongst "com- plex" terminal Pleistocene foragers who were already practicing some degree of  sedentary life and food storage, and that it evolved in those regions where the  plant species concerned were somehow "stressed" in supply, perhaps as a result  of being at the edges of their distributional ranges and thus very vulnerable to  minor environmental changes (for some discussion of these points see Bell- wood 1990b, 1996a, b).  The record from Southwest Asia is the most detailed in the world for an early  transition to agriculture. In general, last glacial environments in Southwest Asia  seem to have been cold, relatively treeless, and perhaps too dry for large-grained  annual grasses to have flourished widely. A major environmental change, the  most major and most rapid in world history since the beginning of the last  interglacial 130,000 years ago, then commenced with the spread of a warmer  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 205  climate, apparently with a more dependable winter wet season, after about  14,000 years ago. The rapidity and magnitude of this change perhaps indicates  why agriculture developed at this time rather than at various times back into  the late Pleistocene. The result of this environmental change was a spread of  annual grasses and nut-bearing tree species that allowed some groups, such as  the Natufians of the Levant, to inhabit small but fairly permanent villages sup- ported by food storage for lean seasons. Increasing sedentary settlement should  then have allowed more frequent births, leading to an inexorable rise in popu- lation (as indicated by modern studies on recently settled hunter-gatherers; e.g.,  Gomes 1982 for settled Negritos in Malaysia). This in itself might have been suf- ficient to encourage groups to increase their grain yields by systematic cultiva- tion, but a postulated shift back to a cooler and drier climate in the Levant after  11,000 BP (the "Younger Dryas") might have provided an extra stimulus in this  regard. Soon after 10,500 years ago, the erstwhile Natufians were building large  pre-pottery Neolithic villages such as Jericho, with some villages (Abu Hureyra,  Ain Ghazal) attaining sizes over 10 hectares by 9,500 years ago. If this postu- lated trajectory is correct, the late Natufians were probably the first people in  the world to cultivate grains-and we may almost know why (for references on  the above see Bellwood 1996b).  A. The Beginnings of Agriculture in China  Note: The term China refers here to a geographical region, and not purely to the  region currently inhabited by the Sinitic (Chinese-speaking) people. Some of  the prehistoric societies of the region were perhaps ancestral to modern Chi- nese. Others, especially those to be described below, certainly were not and are  better regarded as ancestral Southeast Asian in cultural affiliation.  It is quite difficult to apply the Southwest Asian model directly to eastern Asia  because the necessary details in the archaeological record simply are not there,  although this need not imply that a different model is required. Rice and  millets were being cultivated in village settlements in central China by at least  8,000 years ago (Chang 1986; Yan 1991, 1992; Shih 1992; Jiang 1994), but in  China the Neolithic as known to date begins with the presences of pottery and  domestic animals, neither of which appeared in Southwest Asia until up to two  millennia after the first evidence for plant cultivation. This suggests strongly  that the indigenous roots of agriculture in China still remain to be discovered.  Agriculture in China seems unlikely to be a simple transference from Southwest  Asia as the crops, technologies, and people in the two regions are quite unrelated.  As in Southwest Asia, the climatic amelioration at the end of the Pleistocene  in China involved a rise of temperature, approaching present levels by 13,000  </page> <page sequence="6"> 206 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  BP, and also the development of a much stronger summer monsoon (see Chap- ter 1), which would have encouraged dispersal of the ancestors of the cultivated  annual millets and rice, both summer monsoon crops (Whyte 1983; Oka 1988;  Chang, T. T. 1989). Indeed, climatic conditions in China between 10,000 and  4,000 years ago were slightly warmer and wetter than now and would have  been very favorable for summer rice crops in the swamps and lakes of the  Yangzi valley (Chang, K. C. 1986:211-212). As in Southwest Asia, there is some  evidence that the overall climatic amelioration was temporarily reversed by a  Younger Dryas interval between 11,000 and 10,200 years ago, but whether this  would have had any impact on the shift to cultivation, as currently claimed by  some scholars for Southwest Asia (Moore and Hillman 1992), remains uncer- tain. Any temporary shortening of the summer growing season on the northern  edge of wild rice distribution could, however, have been quite significant for  populations targeting it as a food source.  Cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, was derived from the wild Oryza rufipogon with  both annual and perennial habits according to Oka (1988), but via an interme- diate wild annual form Oryza nivara according toT. T. Chang (1976b) (see Plate  38). According to Oka (1988:131-132), wild rice today grows only as far north  as Fujian, but grew as far north as the Yangzi until the Song dynasty. In the  warmer climatic conditions of the early Holocene we might expect wild rice to  have grown well north into the region between the Yellow and Yangzi Rivers. It  certainly appears to have been first domesticated in the swampy regions lining  the middle and lower courses of the Yangzi River (Glover 1985; Yan 1991, 1992;  Bellwood et al. 1992; Y. Wu 1996), and thus toward the edge of its natural range  in a region where winter storage and synchronized annual planting would have  been encouraged.  The morphological and genetic changes in rice-reduced shattering, greater  synchronicity of germination and ripening, increased panicle (rather than grain)  size, reduced awns and glumes, tendency to evolve self-pollination-were prob- ably stimulated by the same kinds of harvesting and management activities that  led to the related changes in wheat and barley in Southwest Asia (Oka 1988;  T. T. Chang 1989; Thompson 1992). Such activities include the use of a sickle/  reaping knife, selection of nonshattering stock for planting, planting outside  the areas of wild stands, and winter storage of seed leading to reduced selection  pressures for tough protective glumes. According to Oka (1988:101), some of  these changes could have taken place rapidly. The rice cultivation of Hemudu  in Zhejiang Province (c. 5000 Be) is described by Yan (1992:121) as being  already "of a fairly advanced form," and according to Li Kunsheng (1985) the  Hemudu rice was already differentiated into indica and japonica varieties.  The overall trajectory of the oldest Chinese Neolithic cultures can be sum- marized as follows (for site locations, see Fig. 7.1):  </page> <page sequence="7"> FUJIAN TA-P'ENG-K'ENG  FUGUODUN &amp;YUAN-SHAN  GUANGDONG • &lt;&gt;"  -9, P'ENGY~~~ P'U rAI-YUAN  FENG-PI- PEINAN  rOU K'EN-TING  '.  % 0 .·  a  :::&gt;  oNON PAWAI &lt;e  BAN KAO  • ?0  ~ !o N ONG CHAE SAO 15 KHaOnKd  NPHANOM 01 BAWNGAN ONG NOR  0 I)  \)" :;&gt;l BAGUMBAYAN  ,~  ' $" ·.

From  published data it is not clear whether we have here one primary develop- ment of agriculture with two minor sub-foci, or two independent devel- opments, but numerous finds of rice in the Yellow River region indicate  that all these groups were in some degree of contact Oiang 1994; Wu Yaoli  1996). Suggestions that some cave sites in southern China have older pot- tery than the above are suspect in the absence of well-verified open sites.  2. 5000 sc: The Yangshao, Dawenkou, Hemudu, and Majiabang cultures all  developed in central China, plus assemblages distributed down the south- ern coast of China to Fujian and Guangdong (K. C. Chang 1995; Tsang  1992, 1995; and see Meacham 1984-1985a for some possible dates of this  order for painted pottery assemblages from Hong Kong and Macau). The  assemblages from coastal regions south of the Yangzi, including Taiwan,  are all fairly closely related in terms of ceramic detail (e.g., red slip, cord  marking, perforated pedestals, general shape repertoire, etc., not to men- tion the broad range of nonceramic material culture such as stone adzes  and stone reaping knives1). However, direct evidence for rice cultivation is  so far absent from the oldest sites in Guangdong, Taiwan, and Hong Kong,  despite a definite presence by 3000 sc at the site of Shixia in Guangdong.  There can be no doubt that one of the most important sites excavated in  recent years with respect to rice cultivation is Hemudu, which lies on a flat allu- vial plain about 25 kilometers to the south of Hangzhou Bay in northeastern  Zhejiang (Chekiang 1978; K. C. Chang 1986:208-224; Liu 1985). The bottom  waterlogged layer of this site (layer 4) dates to between 5200 and perhaps 4900  BC and belonged to a village of rectangular timber houses (one being 7 meters  wide by over 23 meters long) constructed with skillful mortice and tenon tech- niques and raised on rows of small timber piles. Large quantities of rice husks  were found as temper in the sherds, and in one area of the excavation a solid  mass of rice husks, grains, straw, and leaves formed a layer-perhaps once a  threshing floor-with an average thickness of 40-50 centimeters. This rice was  presumably cultivated in the alluvial soils around the site, possibly with a range  of aquatic plants in low-lying swamps (H-L. Li 1983). Pigs accounted for 90 per- cent of all animal bones; it is assumed that they were domesticated, together  with dogs and possibly water buffalo (domesticated fowl are known from other  contemporary Chinese sites). The range of mammals hunted included deer, rhi- noceros, elephant, and monkey; birds were hunted as well. An interesting  occurrence amongst the plant remains is the gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), a plant  of widespread importance in Southeast Asia and Oceania.

The material culture of Hemudu (Fig. 7.2 and Fig. 7.3) is particularly impres- sive. It includes hoes made from animal scapulae, bone tools and whistles, jade  penannular earrings, and stone adzes with oval or quadrangular cross-sections,  </page> <page sequence="11"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 211  --------------------- some resembling the stepped form of the Ta-p'en-k'eng culture of Taiwan  (below). Knee-shaped adze hafts were found-this shape occurs in initial Jomon  Japan and almost universally amongst the Austronesian peoples of Oceania- and there are also some detachable wooden spade blades. Pottery items include  spindle whorls and a range of round or flat-based, cord-marked vessels, the  former often having carinated bodies and incised rims. Pot stands, pottery  stoves, animal figurines, footed dishes, and lids also occur, and there are a few  painted sherds. This pottery tradition shows that the totality of potting knowl- edge found in the early cultures of Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia was al- ready present in this region a millennium before the beginnings of Austrone- sian expansion.  I have examined the consequences of the shift to agriculture in China else- where (Bellwood 1994, 1995b, 1996a, b). They were massive indeed if we exam- ine both archaeological and linguistic sources of evidence, leading to a demo- graphically driven dispersal of populations that encompassed the next five  millennia and over half the world's surface (including Oceania). One part of  this dispersal, as a peripheral offshoot from the southeastern part of the early  Chinese agricultural domain, is represented by the Austronesians. Their Aus- troasiatic contemporaries in the Malay Peninsula are dealt with in Chapter 8.  II. THE BEGINNINGS OF AUSTRONESIAN PREHISTORY  I now wish to move straight into a review of the modern archaeological evi- dence pertinent to Austronesian dispersal. It is not my intention to review the  outdated but historically interesting theories about stone adze types and waves  of migration into the archipelago-readers will find these details in a previous  book (Bellwood 1978:170-175, 207). Solheim (e.g., 1975, 1979a, b, 1984-1985)  has also developed a nonlinguistic theory of Austronesian origins amongst  mobile trading sea peoples in eastern Indonesia, with secondary movements up  to the south Chinese coast and then eventual back movements of Malays and  Chams from south China into the archipelago. A similar theory has been devel- oped without reference to linguistic data by Meacham (1984-1985b, 1992).  These theories differ from my own in several fundamental respects, as this  chapter will indicate.  A. The Prehistory of Taiwan  Prior to the Neolithic, the island of Taiwan has only a limited record of flaked  stone assemblages (the "Ch'angpinian"), probably related to the Hoabinhian,  which survived in the south and east of the island until about 3000 Be (Sung  1979; K-C. Li 1983a).z (For recent reviews seeK-C. Li et al. 1989; P.J-K. Li et al.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 212 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  a r -, "\ \ I  \ I I  \ I I '  ••  • /  .'  ·fJ~. 0 15Cm  g  k  0 10 Cm  Fig. 7.4 Artifacts of the Ta-p'en-k'eng culture: (a-g) cord-marked and incised pottery, including a lug  (e) and a perforated ring-foot (f); (h) waisted "net sinker''; (i) perforated slate projectile point; OJ clay  pendant(?); (k) stepped adze; (I) adze; (m) pitted pebble anvil. From Chang 1969. Courtesy: Yale  University, Department of Anthropology.  1995.) The oldest Neolithic assemblages belong to a culture with cord-marked  and incised pottery, termed the Ta-p'en-k'eng (henceforth TPK) culture by Chang  (for details seeK. C. Chang 1969, 1970, 1986; Chang et al. 1974; Dewar 1977).  One of these sites (at Pa-chia-ts'un near T'ainan) has a single radiocarbon date  of about 4300 Be, and the culture appears to have continued in existence in  western Taiwan until about 2500 BC (Pearson 1989; Spriggs 1989:605). Charac- teristic artifacts (Fig. 7.4) include cord-marked globular pots with incised  everted rims and occasional lug handles or ring feet (some with perforations),  stone adzes with quadrangular cross-sections and occasionally with hafting  steps, polished slate points, stone net sinkers, and possibly a stone bark-cloth  beater (an artifact type also reported from Neolithic sites in southern China).  The whole culture gives the appearance of having been introduced into the  island fully formed.  Sites related to the TPK culture have been recently excavated by Tsang (1992;  1995) in the Pescadores (P'eng-hu) Islands, which lie 45 kilometers west of Tai- wan and about 140 kilometers from the Chinese mainland. The first phase rep- </page> <page sequence="13"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 213  resented here is the Kuo-yeh, dated from 3000 to 2500 BC. It contains a material  culture of TPK type-without rice or reaping knives-that Tsang believes was  brought by colonists from Taiwan. Rice (as husks in pottery), stone knives, and  bone fishhooks make an appearance in the next phase, termed the Suo-kang,  after 2500 BC.  The economy of the TPK culture has been a matter of some obscurity as  cereal remains have not yet been reported from the major excavated sites. The  prehistory of millet in Taiwan is a complete mystery, even though linguistic  reconstruction suggest a great antiquity for it (Zorc 1994:549). Nevertheless,  given the importance of rice cultivation in the mainland province of Zhejiang  at least a millennium before the Taiwanese Neolithic commenced, I would be  most surprised if this crop was totally absent on the island before 2500 Be. Most  authorities on Taiwanese prehistory (e.g., Tsang, above) believe that cereals were  not introduced into the island until after 2500 BC, when stone reaping knives  became common in the western region. However, the pollen diagram from the  Sun-Moon Lake in the mountainous center of Taiwan indicates a marked increase  in large grass pollen, second-growth shrubs, and charcoal particles soon after  3000 BC (Tsukada 1966, 1967). As this region is rather remote from the coastal  areas where early agriculture must first have been established, then it follows  that agriculture (if this is what the core records) must have appeared long before  this date in Taiwan. More significantly, actual rice remains (apart from those of  the Suo-kang phase, above) have been reported from the Chih-shan-yen site in  Taipei (ca. 1500-2000 BC; Wang 1984), and rice impressions in pottery are  reported from the K'en-ting site in the far south of the island (ca. 2500 BC; K-C.  Li 1983a), although both of these sites belong to cultural phases apparently  following the TPK.  The immediate origins of the TPK culture clearly lie on the Chinese main- land. K. C. Chang (1977) has drawn attention to TPK ceramic parallels with the  shell-mound site of Fuguodun in nearby Fujian, dated between 5200 and 4200  Be. From here there are potsherds decorated with incised lines, impressed rows  of semicircles, and zoned patterns within incisions made by dentate stamping  with the toothed edge of an Anadara shell. More recently, both K. C. Chang  (1995) and C-H. Tsang have looked in great detail at the question of TPK rela- tions with the Chinese mainland and point to a very large number of pertinent  sites, mostly shellmounds and some with evidence for stilt houses (Tsang 1992:  246; 1995). These sites include several in Guangdong (Tsang 1992:245-246),  plus several farther north in Fujian (Xitou, Keqiutou, early Tanshishan), and  there can be little doubt that the similarities indicate contact if not common  population origin. Importantly for questions of navigational and canoe-con- struction technology, several of these sites are on small offshore islands (as are  some of the Hemudu culture sites in Zhejiang). Whether these material culture  </page> <page sequence="14"> 214 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  similarities indicate borrowing by native Ch'angpinians of Taiwan from main- land sources, as suggested by Meacham (1995), or whether they represent an  actual colonization of Taiwan by pre-Austronesians of mainland origin, is a  question that will doubtless exercise the minds of archaeologists for some time  to come. I have no doubts about my own opinions, which, as clearly stated  above, give much credence to the results of comparative linguistics.  Pre-Austronesians therefore colonized Taiwan from Fujian or Guangdong,  but when did their descendants, following the break-up of Prato-Austronesian,  begin their moves into the Philippines? The answers to this question are to be  found in the post-TPK cultures of Taiwan. By the late third millennium BC the  TPK culture had apparently differentiated into at least three, perhaps four  regional archaeological complexes, possibly already with initial linguistic differ- entiation into the several first-order Austronesian subgroups that are believed to  exist on Taiwan (see Chapter 4). In the west and south of the island there are  cultures with red cord-marked pottery, originally termed Lungshanoid by  K. C. Chang (1969). These are best known from Chang's excavations at Feng-pi- t'ou and from the Choshui and Tatu River sites (including the site of Niu-ma- t'ou) in the west-center of the island (K. C. Chang et al. 1974; Dewar 1977;  Stamps 1977), and also from sites with slightly different assemblages in the far  south of the island (K'en-ting and 0-luan-pi; K-C. Li 1983a, 1983b). Dates run  from about 2500 to 500 BC . The Feng-pi-t'ou assemblage includes red cord- marked and painted pottery with a considerable elaboration of form, repre- sented by tripods, high perforated ring feet, bottle forms, and the use of a slow  wheel (Fig. 7.5).

The postholes of  part of a rectangular house were excavated at Feng-pi-t'ou, together with a burial  stated to have Mongoloid affinities.  The Lungshanoid cultures of western Taiwan do not appear to be of direct  significance for the settlement of the Philippine and Indonesian islands to the  south. However, I think the situation may be different with the Yuan-shan cul- ture of northern Taiwan, which was derived according to all authorities by local  development from the preceding TPK culture (possibly via the Chih-shan-yen  culture with its domesticated rice in the Taipei region; Wang 1984). Dates for  Yuan-shan and Chih-shan-yen assemblages range from 2500 BC into the first  millennium BC. Yuan-shan pottery is characterized by globular vessels with ring  feet and strap handles, decorated with some incision or punctation and red or  brown slips (Plate 30). Cord marking and tripods are absent; this is quite signif- icant because the oldest pottery assemblages in the Philippines and Indonesia  also lack these features. In addition, the slate reaping knives are absent in the  Yuan-shan culture, as they are again in the later sites to the south (although  they are present in the west of the island). So if rice cultivation continued,  people may have turned to bamboo knives, as used today for millet in highland  Taiwan (see Note 1, pages 316-317).  Other Yuan-shan items include untanged, shouldered and stepped quadran- gular adzes, slate projectile points, chipped stone hoes, stone bark-cloth beaters,  and spindle whorls of clay (Fig. 7.6). The latter are of interest as they also occur  in the red corded-ware sites of western Taiwan and in the southern Chinese  Neolithic cultures; they suggest that a knowledge of weaving, perhaps using  hemp fibers on a backstrap loom, was present. Domestic dogs are also claimed  from some Yuan-shan sites, but the presence of domesticated pigs seems uncer- tain in the Taiwanese Neolithic (pig bones are present in many sites, but per- haps they were hunted).  Down the eastern coast of Taiwan, Pearson (1968, 1969) has investigated  sites of the related T'ai-yuan culture; these are generally undated but they seem  to be associated with stone-slab graves, sarcophagi, and uprights, together with  Yuan-shan style pottery with the characteristic ring feet and loop handles. Since  the first edition of this book was published, however, east coast Taiwan archae- ology has been illuminated by some quite remarkable discoveries at the 40- to  SO-hectare village site of Peinan (Lien 1989, 1991, 1993). The excavations here  took place owing to railway construction and have yielded remains of fifty  house foundations and over 1,500 burials, dating mainly between 1500 and 800  BC, but with an earlier and less well understood component related to the TPK  culture beneath. The houses were constructed on rectangular stone pavements  and laid out in rows, with adjacent rows of stone-walled storehouses (Plate 31).  </page> <page sequence="16"> a  .  c d e\ 1  ()  g h J  ·::  k ll  m  0 5 10  vr rnA en  Fig. 7.6 Top two rows show artifacts from Feng-pi-t'ou: (a, b) stone knives; (c-e) baked clay spindle  whorls; (f) clay disc (compare Fig. 7.2a).

The floors of the dwelling  houses sealed slab-lined burial cists (Plate 32), an arrangement indicating a defi- nite interest in ancestor veneration on the part of the inhabitants. The graves,  many multiple, revealed a high rate of infant and fetal death, for reasons at  present unknown (Lien 1991: 344).3  The pottery from the Peinan graves is mainly a fine orange ware, sometimes  red slipped, with no other forms of decoration. The most common form ap- pears to be a jar with two vertical strap handles (like Yuan-shan pottery) and a  ring foot. Spindle whorls, pig and dog figurines, and stone bark-cloth beaters  also occur in the site. The grave goods include some remarkable items of Taiwan  jade: tubular beads, bracelets, penannular earrings with circumferential projec- tions (the so-called lingling-o, a very widespread form in Southeast Asia; see Chap- ter 9), anthropomorphic earrings (Fig. 7.7), and perforated projectile points. Most  adults had four of their upper teeth extracted-canine and first incisor on each  side-and stained teeth attest to betel chewing. Lien also suggests (1991: 350)  that both rice and millet were cultivated. The Peinan culture is also claimed by  Lien to have living representatives in the Paiwan peoples of eastern Taiwan.  Looking at Taiwanese prehistory from an Indo-Malaysian perspective, it is  obviously the cultural phase prior to about 2000 BC that is of most interest,  since it is clear that Austronesian settlers had already moved into the Philip- pines and perhaps Indonesia by this time. The Peinan culture is thus a little late  to be of direct interest, but its plain pottery style finds some affinity with the  oldest pottery assemblages to the south. The TPK culture is of enormous impor- tance as a potential record of the oldest stage of Austronesian society that can  be identified on linguistic grounds (i.e., Initial Austonesian). Not only does this  culture have clear mainland Chinese origins, but it also has what I believe are  clear successors in the Yuan-shan and Peinan cultures and the earliest Neolithic  cultures of the Philippines and Indonesia.  It is still uncertain when rice cultivation appeared within this cultural  sequence; my suspicion is that rice remains will turn up in TPK sites eventually.  Although most highland Austronesians of Taiwan grow hardier millets today  (Setaria, Panicum, and the more recent Indian Sorghum and Eleusine; Chen 1968;  Fogg 1983), it must be remembered that the warmer western lowlands where  the oldest Neolithic sites occur are now entirely settled by Chinese rice growers.  Other aboriginally cultivated plants in Taiwan include sugarcane and gourd,  and it is highly likely that these were grown, with Setaria (foxtail) millet, by TPK  societies as well; all are of at least Prato-Austronesian antiquity. Although coco- nuts and breadfruit grow in southeastern Taiwan today, it seems more than  likely that these two tropical species were introduced later into the warmer  parts of the island from the Philippines.  </page> <page sequence="18"> Co.· :·o·-,_:. . ©....  •' ..

THE NEOLITHIC PHASE IN ISLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA AND  WESTERN OCEANIA  I will now consider the archaeological evidence for Neolithic assemblages in the  Philippines and Indonesia, and will later expand this evidence into a larger pic- ture of economic change and adaptation. However, I should first go back again  to the Neolithic cultures of Taiwan between 3000 and 2000 BC and note the  material items present. These include quadrangular cross-sectioned adzes, bone  and slate projectile points, and a pottery tradition that trends through time  from a predominance of cord marking toward an emphasis on plain or slipped  bodies (in the case of the Yuan-shan and Peinan cultures), with the continuing  presence of incised, stamped circle, and punctate decoration and perforated  ring feet. Other items include stone net weights, hoes, and possibly bones of  domesticated pigs and dogs. Reaping knives and spindle whorls are not clearly  present until after 2500 BC.  In the Philippines, northern Borneo, and many regions of eastern Indonesia,  the oldest Neolithic pottery is characterized by simple forms with plain or red- slipped surfaces, sometimes with perforated ring feet. This phase has no very  clear internal divisions at present; it seems to continue everywhere with no  marked breaks into the last 2,000 years. However, it is convenient to separate  the post-500 BC cultures-those with metallurgy and predominantly incised  pottery-from those that went before; these later cultures will be considered in  Chapter 9. In the first edition of this book, I also separated a number of deco- rated pottery assemblages as "late Neolithic" and tre:tted them separately, but  subsequent research and dating has left little rationale for this decision. In this  chapter I will cover all Neolithic sites in Island Southeast Asia, leaving the  Malay Peninsula-a completely separate cultural entity from the islands during  the Neolithic-for consideration in Chapter 8.  The most varied Neolithic assemblages occur in the northern Philippines,  which is what could be expected given their closeness to Taiwan. The more  southerly sites in Borneo, Talaud, the Moluccas, Sulawesi, and Timor show some  degree of attenuation of material culture. Java and Sumatra are unclear in this  respect because few presumed Neolithic sites there have been excavated-and  none dated.  A. The Philippines  The Philippines reveal a widespread horizon of red-slipped pottery beginning  perhaps around 2500 BC. In northern Luzon, an important open site called  Dimolit has been excavated by Peterson (1974:) on Palanan Bay in Isabela Prov- ince. The lower occupation level here has three rather widely spread radio- </page> <page sequence="20"> 220 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  E::J small post holes  I@ &amp;I large pool holes  lo 0! modern post holes  &amp;\'/\) I heavy aoh  §].shallow ditch  1m. 2m. ....

Posthole  settings for two 3 x 3-meter square houses were found, each with double walls,  the outer post row being set in a slot (Fig. 7.8). The pottery is plain or red  slipped and comprises globular or carinated vessels and dishes, some on ring  feet with small, clustered perforations.  Many other sites in northern Luzon-located in the main valley and tribu- taries of the Cagayan River-have yielded types of pottery similar to Dimolit.  The caves of Rabel and Laurente have yielded dates for it that might be as early  as 2800 Be (Spriggs 1989:593), and at Andarayan similar red-slipped pottery has  been dated to 1500 BC, here with rice chaff temper, pottery stoves, and spindle  whorls (Snow et al. 1986). Musang Cave (Thiel 1988-1989) has yielded similar  plain and red-slipped pottery with ring feet. Another cave called Arku (Thiel  1986-1987a) produced a burial assemblage dated between 1500 Be and 0, with  pottery similar to that from Musang. Other items from Arku, many clearly par- alleled in Taiwanese Neolithic sites, include shell and stone beads, shell brace- lets, two tattooing chisels of horn, penannular earrings of stone (including two  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 221  of jade), shell, or pottery like those from Peinan, a stone bark-cloth beater,  pottery spindle whorls, barbed bone points, and stone adzes. The burials were  apparently primary or secondary and sometimes dusted with ochre or placed  in jars.  Other artifacts with Taiwanese parallels, such as slate projectile points, have  been found in surface collections in Luzon. It is apparent that excavations on  this island are well on the way to demonstrating a significant Taiwan-northern  Philippine axis of Neolithic continuity. This conclusion is reinforced by the dis- covery of a site called Sunget on Batan Island, between Taiwan and Luzon.  Although Sunget has not yet been excavated or dated, the preliminary survey  report (Kumamoto 1983:55-61) refers to discoveries of red-slipped pottery with  ring feet and lug handles, perforated slate points, and stepped and shouldered  adzes-all items closely paralleled in the Yuan-shan repertoire.  In addition, there are some sites in the northern and central Philippines that  contain incised and dentate-stamped sherds as well as the universal plain or  red-slipped wares. At Lal-lo and Magapit, in the lower valley of the Cagayan  River in northern Luzon, there are many estuarine bivalve shell middens; they  range in location from close to the river to nearby hilltops and in size up to SO  by 100 meters, with depths up to 3 meters. Many sporadic archaeological forays  have been made on these middens, but unfortunately there is no overall sum- mary available. However, the material culture is extremely interesting, not least  because of the richness of incision and dentate stamping on some of the pot- tery, with high perforated ring feet and some lime infill of designs. Stepped  stone adzes also occur, with dates apparently back to about 2000 BC (Thiel  1984-1985, 1986-1987b; Aoyagi et al. 1991; Ogawa 1993). The richness of the  dentate stamping, dated in the Magapit hilltop site to ca. 800 BC by Aoyagi, is  important for considering the affinities of the oldest pottery in the Micronesian  and Melanesian islands (see the discussion on the Lapita culture below). Pottery  very similar to that from the Cagayan middens is also reported from a disturbed  burial cave excavated by Solheim (1968) in Batungan Mountain on the island of  Masbate (central Philippines). A carbon date of about 900 BC from an adjacent  and perhaps slightly later cave may be pertinent for this, and the Batungan  assemblage concerned (from cave 1) includes a quantity of red-slipped sherds  from carinated vessels, with incised, dentate-stamped, and stamped-circle  motifs much like those from the Yuan-shan repertoire on Taiwan (compare  Plate 30 and Fig. 7.9). So far, this stamped and incised pottery decoration does  not appear to be present in the oldest pottery sites in the Philippines, but this  may simply be a sampling bias; much further work is needed on this question.  Moving toward the southern Philippines, Fox (1970) has excavated in Du- yong Cave on Palawan a flexed and face-down burial of a male provided with a  quadrangular-sectioned stone adze, four Tridacna shell adzes, two ear discs and  </page> <page sequence="22"> 222 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  --------------- --- - ------ - ---- ----- .  • . f  ) &amp;- .

Charcoal from the burial pit was dated to  about 3000 sc, and similar shell implements also occurred in a level in the cave  deposits dated to about 4300 s c . This site is unusual in having no pottery and  its early date suggests that the stone adze may have been traded from agricul- tural populations situated elsewhere into an indigenous hunting and gathering  community. The shell tools may indicate a local tradition, a continuance per- haps of the preceramic tradition of shell adzes represented in the northern  Moluccas (Chapter 6; see Plate 25).  Elsewhere in the Philippines, plain pottery is reported from shell midden  deposits dated to about 2000 sc in the Bagumbayan site on Masbate (Bay Peter- </page> <page sequence="23"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 223  c  0 I 2 3 4 5 Scm  ~---- Fig. 7.10 Burial goods from Duyong Cave, Palawan, ca. 3000 BC (?):(a) shell adze; (b-d) Conus  shell discs and pendant; (e) stone adze.

Plain, slipped, and incised sherds  occur at around the same date in the Edjek site on Negros (Hutterer and Mac- donald 1982:223). Plain and red-slipped sherds also occur in the Balobok (Sanga- sanga) shelter in the Sulu Archipelago (Spoehr 1973; Ronquillo et al. 1993), but  in this case with very uncertain dates.  In general, the Philippine Neolithic sites have continuing evidence for pig  and deer hunting as well as for the use of flake tools (some with an edge gloss at  Dimolit), but to my knowledge stone reaping knives are not found at all and  the pottery spindle whorls do not occur south of Luzon. As noted for the Yuan- shan and Peinan cultures of Taiwan, grain reaping may have been carried out  with organic tools, or it may have faded away toward equatorial latitudes. The  </page> <page sequence="24"> 224 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  latter is an option that I will elaborate upon in due course. Weaving may have  been replaced by bark-cloth production in many areas (a conclusion also reached  by Ngo 1984-1985 to explain the shift away from cord-marked pottery to the  south of Taiwan), but as weaving was so widespread ethnographically, an initial  retraction followed much later by an expansion-perhaps with fibers such as  cotton or abaca (Musa textilis)-might have occurred.  B. Indonesia and Sabah  Within Indonesia, the Leang Tuwo Mane'e shelter in the Talaud Islands has  yielded plain and red-slipped sherds from thin-walled vessels with globular  bodies and everted rims (Fig. 7.11 top) dating possibly from about 2500 BC  (Bellwood 1976a, 1981; the date comes from a single determination and is not  very secure). Large numbers of shellfish continued to be discarded in the  Neolithic layers in this site and the preceramic chert industry continued, but  without the earlier tendency toward blade production (see Chapter 6, Section  IliA). Across the Sulawesi Sea in the cave of Agop Atas (Madai) in northern  Borneo (see Chapter 6, Section liB), the early Holocene pebble and flake indus- try was succeeded-after a long gap in occupation-by a pottery assemblage  similar to that from Talaud (Fig. 7.11 bottom) with a continuing stone flake  industry. This has been dated a little uncertainly-by thermoluminescence and  radiocarbon-between 2000 and 500 BC (Bellwood 1988). After 500 BC the cave  was again abandoned until the early Metal phase about 2,000 years ago.  Both Leang Tuwo Mane'e and Agop Atas produced little more than pottery,  leading me in the earlier edition of this book to suggest an attenuation of mate- rial culture as Austronesian groups colonized southward. In 1987, excavations  in the rock shelter of Bukit Tengkorak-formed amongst tumbled boulders on  the rim of an extinct volcano near the town of Semporna in southeastern Sabah  -have led me to change my mind somewhat (Bellwood 1989; Bellwood and  Koon 1989). The lower layer in this shelter, dated between 1000 and 300 BC,  yielded red-slipped pottery with plain or incised pedestals, a superbly decorated  incised vessel with a lid (Fig. 7.12), and lots of shell items including adzes,  beads, bracelets, and a possible fishhook shank, together with shell manufactur- ing debris. Stone tools included lava files, adze chips, a remarkable agate blade  and awl industry made on prismatic cores and, perhaps most remarkable of all,  small chips of obsidian from two sources: one unknown and the other being  one of the Talasea sources in northern New Britain in Mela-nesia. The Talasea  obsidian sources were used by Lapita people in the western Pacific, and the  Bukit Tengkorak discovery of this material increases its distribution at ca. 1000  BC to 6,500 kilometers-from Borneo to Fiji-thus making it perhaps the most  widely distributed material in the Neolithic world.  </page> <page sequence="25"> (  ,,  ,,  /  /  A3c A2f  .,  "\   \ I A3f  I  ' /  ' /  )  ' \  ~  ~idknob  Fig. 7.11 Neolithic pottery from Leang Tuwo Mane'e (top) and Agop Atas (bottom).  </page> <page sequence="26"> /  ~PEDESTAL  UI"PER liD PII.OFIU UNCERTAIN  &amp;0  " " ~  -eJ ~CM  II • -QJo  U II  :.: . .  - 1=-==-o=:iS CM  • :: DIRECTION Of FlAKING  - Fig. 7.12 Artifacts mainly from the lower layer (1000 to 300 BC) at Bukit Tengkorak, Sabah.

Red slip faded in importance. Fragments of pottery stoves, an im- portant artifact class known as far back as 4500 BC in the Hemudu site in Zhe- jiang (Bellwood 1989:Plate 3), are quite common, as are decorated lids and ped- estals. Talasea obsidian was no longer imported in this phase, which dates  between 300 BC and the early first millennium AD, but the other shell and stone  industries seem to have continued. Both phases at Bukit Tengkorak are rich in  fish bones and these, plus the obsidian, pottery stoves (used ethnographically  by sea nomads in the Sabah-Sulu region), and shell ornament manufacture indi- cate that the Bukit Tengkorak people were adept seafarers-and perhaps traders.  Indeed, the agate prismatic blade industry is quite unique in Island Southeast  Asia and, if not a local innovation, could reflect contact with an apparently  contemporary region of similar microblade production in Guangdong, espe- cially the site complex of Xiqiaoshan, near Guangzhou (Huang et al. 1982). The  much poorer assemblage of this period from Agop Atas could thus represent a  community of inland cultivators, people not a part of this interisland network  of contacts.  Does the Bukit Tengkorak assemblage represent the kind of maritime-oriented  tradition that should have characterized the earliest Austronesian colonists who  moved into Oceania? The site has yielded no direct evidence for agriculture, but  then neither have most others of this phase in Island Southeast Asia; the prob- lem may have more to do with sampling and survival than a true absence.  The late-phase decorated pottery from Bukit Tengkorak has some perhaps  superficial similarities with the pottery assemblage known for many years from  the inland sites of Kalumpang and Minango Sipakko, which lie close together  on the middle course of the Karama River in west-central Sulawesi. These two  sites have produced perhaps the most remarkable pottery assemblages of any  sites in Indonesia. Unfortunately, neither is dated, and Kalumpang-the most  important-was investigated long ago by Stein Callenfels in 1933 and by Hee- keren in 1949 (Heekeren 1950a, 1972:184-190; Sutayasa 1973). Both are open  sites with no stratigraphic differentiation of the materials found, and the assem- blages include quadrangular and lenticular-sectioned stone adzes, some with  unusual waisted or knobbed profiles, ground slate projectile points similar to  the Taiwanese Neolithic types (but without perforations), a stone bark-cloth  beater, and some possible stone reaping knives (Plate 33). The pottery is espe- cially remarkable-some of the motifs are shown in Fig. 7.13-and there are  also some knobbed lids and ring feet with cut-out decoration. Of all the pre- sumed pre-Metal assemblages excavated in Indonesia, this one-at least in its  stone repertoire and some aspects of pottery decoration-seems to have the  closest resemblance to the Neolithic assemblages of Taiwan.  </page> <page sequence="28"> Fig. 7.13 Incised sherds and a modeled face from Kalumpang, west-central Sulawesi.

However, given the Taiwanese parallels for the stone points and  the Oceanic Lapita parallels for the pottery decoration, I would personally not  be too surprised if an age of over 3,000 years can one day be demonstrated. As  always, more research is needed.  In southwestern Sulawesi, pottery appears in small quantities in the upper  layers of Toalian sites, perhaps here used by continuing hunter-gatherer popula- tions. In the shelter of Ulu Leang, Glover (1976) has reported the first pottery at  about 2500 BC in a continuing Toalian industry with Maras points, although  Bulbeck (1992:13), on the basis of some new radiocarbon dates on human bone  from Leang Burung 1, is unwilling to date pottery here earlier than 1500 BC.  The sherds here are of plain, unslipped globular cooking pots with everted rims.  In the northern Moluccas, the type of red-slipped and occasionally incised  pottery typical of the Bukit Tengkorak early phase, Agop Atas, and Leang Tuwo  Mane'e is also found in the excavated rock shelter of Uattamdi, on Kayoa Island  to the west of Halmahera. The Uattamdi red-slipped pottery occurs in the lower  layer of the site, beneath an upper layer of early Metal phase jar burials. It con- tains red-slipped pottery-some with painted stripes identical to examples from  Leang Tuwo Mane'e (see Fig 7.11)-lots of shell beads, bracelets and spoons/  scrapers, a lenticular-sectioned stone adze and a stone chisel (plus an abun- dance of adze chips) (Plate 34). In addition, significantly, there are well-strati- fied bones of pig and dog-both of which were no doubt domesticated animals  in this region. The whole assemblage is well dated between 1200 and 300 BC,  after which it is replaced by the more elaborately incised early Metal phase pot- tery assemblage (Bellwood et al. 1993; Bellwood 1995c).  The shelter of Uattamdi also has a basal and culturally sterile beach sand  dated to about 1300 Be; this could be taken to indicate that the makers of the  red-slipped pottery were not occupying Kayoa Island at this time (a statement  of course subject to a certain sampling proviso). Uattamdi has no obsidian and  lacks indications of shell artifact manufacture-unlike Bukit Tengkorak-but its  pottery assemblage is clearly closely related to those of the other sites just listed,  to a degree that surely indicates close ethnic connection across this northeast- ern corner of Island Southeast Asia at ca. 1000 BC. Similar red-slipped pottery, in  this case with some incised decoration, dates from about 900 BC onward in the  open site of Buwawansi, on Gebe Island to the east of Halmahera.  From caves in eastern Timor, Glover (1977a, 1986) has also reported similar  but apparently unslipped pottery dated initially from somewhere between 2500  and 2000 BC. A few decorated sherds were also found in layers dated loosely be- </page> <page sequence="30"> 230 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  y I'  b '  '  a  ®  f  e-~  O"--===:~-lllli3 em  Fig. 7.14 Neolithic shell artifacts and tanged stone points  from eastern Timor: (a) Trochus shell fishhooks from Sui  Ceri Uato; (b) pierced Anadara shell from Uai Sobo 2; (c)  Nautilus shell spacer beads from Sui Ceri Uato; (d) frag- ment of Trochus shell armlet from Uai Sobo 2; (e-g)  tanged stone points from Uai SoboL From Glover 1977a.

The  Timorese caves have also produced shell beads, bracelets, and one-piece angling  hooks of Trochus shell (Fig. 7.14). As at Uattamdi, pig bones appear with the  pottery, again surely domesticated here and derived from Sus scrofa of java or S.  celebensis of Sulawesi (Groves 1981, 1995). Even more surprisingly, Glover was  able to show that cuscuses, civets, and macaques were also introduced at about  the same time as the pigs. It is not clear whether these animals were tamed or  wild at the time of introduction, but this evidence for transport of nondomesti- </page> <page sequence="31"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 231  cated animals into the faunally impoverished islands of eastern Indonesia from  Neolithic times onward is particularly interesting, especially in light of the  much earlier evidence for marsupial translocation in the northern Moluccas. Al- though possibly historic introductions in many cases, the presence of maca- ques, civets, deer, and Javan porcupines on various other islands in the Lesser  Sundas and Moluccas (Musser 1981; Groves 1984) and of the cassowary in  Seram (Wallace 1962:300) should also be noted. Dog, cattle, and goats appear in  the Timorese cave record after 1000 BC, but the goats and cattle could be more  recent.  Plant remains from the Neolithic layers in Timor include the Polynesian  chestnut (Inocarpus), bamboo, gourd, and (after 1000 Be) a single grain of fox- tail millet (Glover 1977b). These Timorese finds are thus of great potential sig- nificance, since they allow the suggestion that an agricultural economy involv- ing at least some form of pig husbandry and possibly millet cultivation was  introduced to the island sometime around 2000 BC.  The early Neolithic sites I have described so far are really the only ones from  which there is coherent dated information, with the exception of sites in Sara- wak that I will consider in Section D below. For Sumatra there is little of a usable  archaeological nature, and Java still remains something of a mystery. The prob- lem for Java and Sumatra may be that Neolithic sites along former northern  coastlines are now likely to be buried under many meters of alluvium and  beneath the water table (like the Hoabinhian middens of Sumatra), and hence  unavailable for archaeological research.4 Nevertheless, the enormous number of  superbly manufactured quadrangular and pick adzes from Java (Duff types 2A  and 7A : Fig. 7.15), often made from semiprecious stones such as serpentine,  agate, or chalcedony, suggests that Neolithic populations once occupied the  island (although some of the finer adzes may actually be of early Metal phase  date). The extensive working floors for adzes and stone bracelets found in  several places in central and western Java add support to this view (Heine Gel- dern 1945); a detailed analysis of material from one such site located between  the villages of Bomo and Teleng in south-central Java has been carried out by  Tanudirjo (1991).  One working floor for quadrangular adzes, excavated at Kendeng Lembu in  eastern Java (Heekeren 1972), produced sherds of thin, red-slipped vessels with  round bases and everted rims. My own examination of this material in Jakarta  suggests that it is related to the early red-slipped pottery of the Philippines and  eastern Indonesia, but few details are available. Otherwise, a scatter of cord- marked and incised pottery finds, particularly from western Java, is summarized  by Sutayasa (1973, 1979; see also Bellwood 1978:220-221). This material is  undated and much of it could of course be long post-Neolithic.

To summarize some of the above, it is apparent that oldest dates for red- slipped and plain pottery anywhere south of Taiwan are not much older than  2000 BC, except possibly for Luzon. Because Austronesian populations had al- ready reached Samoa, in the central Pacific, by 1000 Be, it is beginning to look  </page> <page sequence="33"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 233  as if the Austronesian migrations, at least for the first 10,000 kilometers (Taiwan  to Indonesia and eastward to Samoa), took place within a relatively short time  scale within the second millennium BC. Another source of information, albeit  very diffuse with respect to dating, comes from the pollen record of forest clear- ance. Pollen diagrams from highland swamps in northern and central Sumatra  and western Java provide some interesting but rather equivocal evidence for  forest clearance that may be related to settlement of these regions by cultiva- tors, although unfortunately there are no archaeological records in direct asso- ciation (for summaries see Flenley 1985a, 1985b, 1988; Maloney 1985, 1994).  For instance, a pollen core from Pea Sim Sim Swamp near Lake Toba in north- ern Sumatra (1,450 meters above sea level) indicates that some minor forest  clearance could have started as early as 4500 BC, but the major phase, evidenced  by an increase in large grass pollen, began during the first millennium BC. Lake  Diatas near Padang (1,535 meters above sea level) in central Sumatra has yielded  a similar sequence. The nearby Lake Padang core (950 meters above sea level)  indicates swamp vegetation clearance and burning by about 2000 BC, and there  is evidence here for an increasing protection of the useful Arenga palm species  by 2,000 years ago. At Situ Gunung in western Java (1,015 meters above sea level)  there is an increase of pandanus and fern spores-perhaps indicating some for- est clearance-at about 2800 BC. However, other Sumatran and Javan cores, ad- mittedly from quite high altitudes, offer evidence for major forest clearance  only after 1000 BC (Flenley 1988; Stuijts 1993).  The overall pollen record therefore seems to suggest some intermittent forest  clearance in Sumatra and Java occurring at high altitudes during the mid-Holo- cene, but with permanent clearance occurring only after about 3,000 years ago.  As these records are all from highland areas, it may be reasonable to expect that  cultivation in coastal lowlands began slightly earlier, but this remains uncer- tain. It is also apparent that the Pea Sim Sim dates for initial forest clearance are  a little earlier than would be expected from the archaeological record alone.  This may reflect the fact that hunter-gatherers are quite capable of burning for- est in drought periods, even close to the equator, a circumstance made clear by  the presences of charcoal particles in pollen cores going back well into the late  Pleistocene in New Guinea (Haberle 1993) and by charcoal particles radio- carbon dated to about 10,000 years ago from soils in Brunei (Cranbrook and  Edwards 1994:339). Given what we know of the chronology of dispersal of the  Austronesians, it seems unlikely that systematic forest clearance for agriculture  would have begun in Java and Sumatra much prior to 1500 Be, but new data  could change this view. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Sumatra  and western Borneo were settled by agricultural groups from southern Thailand  or Malaysia before Austronesian settlement commenced; this possibility will be  discussed further for Sarawak in Section D.  </page> <page sequence="34"> 234 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  Earlier agriculturalists, or at least intensive harvesters of tree crops, could also  have occupied parts of eastern Indonesia before Austronesians arrived. The New  Guinea Highlands clearly witnessed an independent transition to swamp agri- culture-perhaps for taro-about 10,000 years ago (Golson 1977; Bellwood  1996b), and questions arise as to whether or not this system ever spread off the  New Guinea mainland. Present indications are that it did not in its fully fledged  swamp-cultivation form (Spriggs 1993), but van der Kaars (1991) notes an in- crease in palm pollen at about 6,000 years ago in Kau Bay, northern Halmahera.  This could represent a record of indigenous intensification of arboriculture,  with consequent population growth. Austronesians clearly were never able to  settle this area successfully, for Papuan languages still dominate the northern  Moluccas today.  C. Western Oceania  In the western Pacific, Austronesian colonists between 1500 and 1000 BC left an  extremely clear-cut trail of pioneer archaeological sites across about 6,500 kilo- meters of ocean and islands (many previously uninhabited), from the Admi- ralty Islands north of New Guinea to as far east as Samoa, in western Polynesia.  This impressive migration probably correlates linguistically with the period of  Proto-Oceanic (see Chapter 4, Section VB). Although much of western Mela- nesia had long been occupied by Papuan-speaking groups, it is clear that these  tended to be settled mainly in the larger islands of New Guinea, the Bismarcks,  and the Solomons. Many small islands, and all territories from perhaps New  Caledonia and Vanuatu eastward (certainly including Fiji), were thus available  for canoe-borne colonization by Austronesian groups.  The resulting La pita culture, which represents colonization of virgin territory  in most locations where it has been found beyond the Solomons, is generally  well dated and well studied in terms of artifacts and economy. It suffers from  few of the chronological problems that beset the often mixed and undated Neo- lithic assemblages from Island Southeast Asia. Lapita, therefore, can provide an  excellent insight into its logical antecedents, which lie somewhere in the east- ern regions of Indonesia or the Philippines (the linguistic evidence points to the  Moluccas and western New Guinea) in the mid-second millennium sc. No one  has yet located these antecedents very precisely, but even if many elaborations  of ceramic decoration (such as dentate stamping) were developed within Mela- nesia itself, we now have clear evidence for the prior existence of cultures with  similar economic, technological, and navigational skills in the Indo-Malaysian  Archipelago (with Taiwan). A brief review of the Lapita culture, and its contem- porary in the Mariana Islands, is thus offered here.  The Lapita evidence, when viewed from an Indo-Malaysian viewpoint, reveals  </page> <page sequence="35"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 235  quite clearly an integrated culture between 1500 and 1000 BC (the later phases  of disintegration are not of concern here) with the following archaeological fea- tures (for summaries see Kirch and Hunt 1988; Green 1991; Allen and Gosden  1992; Galipaud 1992; Spriggs 1995; Kirch 1995; Kirch 1997, Spriggs in press):  a. A range of coiled or slab-built vessels with volcanic or coral sand tempers,  ranging in form from globular cooking pots through narrow-necked water  jars to a variety of open bowls, some with flat bases. Some vessel profiles  are sharply carinated, and other accessories include lug and strap handles,  lids, and pedestals, the latter being most common in the earliest sites such  as those in the Mussau Islands (ca. 1500 Be). Vessel surfaces are often red  slipped, and the decoration, generally in zones around the upper surfaces  of some of the vessels, includes a quite astonishing and intricate range of  incised and dentate-stamped motifs (Plate 35d) of rectilinear,5 curvilinear,  and even anthropomorphic forms (Spriggs 1990), the latter perhaps indi- cating a concern with ancestors common to all Austronesian populations.  Later Lapita pottery tends to have simpler designs, and dentate stamping  fades in popularity first in favor of incision, and eventually plain ware.  b. Economically, the Lapita culture was based on a mixed horticultural and  maritime subsistence. Pigs, fowls, and dogs were all present; plant remains  from waterlogged sites include taro, coconut, candlenut, pandanus, and  canarium, all exploited by pre-Lapita populations in western Melanesia as  well (Kirch 1989; Swadling et al. 1991; Loy et al. 1992). Village settle- ments, in some cases of stilt houses, occupied zones marked by sherdage,  earth ovens, hearths, and other features averaging about one hectare in  size (maximum seven hectares in the Mussau Islands) in coastal and small  offshore island locations. A fairly healthy interisland exchange of obsid- ian and other tool stones was carried out, especially in western Melanesia  between the Bismarck Archipelago and the Santa Cruz Islands. Rats (Rattus  exulans) and occasional wallabies and cuscuses were transported, too.  c. Items of Lapita material culture apart from pottery include stone adzes (all  untanged) with quadrangular and lenticular cross-sections, stone chisels,  shell adzes, a range of shell ornaments (beads, armrings, necklace units),  and one-piece bait fishhooks for angling. The shell fishhooks suggest a  technological adaptation confined mainly to Oceania, but bait hooks of  shell are also found in a few Indo-Malaysian Neolithic sites, especially in  Taiwan and Timor.  The Mariana Islands of western Micronesia were also settled about 1500 BC  (Craib 1993; Butler 1994; Rainbird 1994; Amesbury et al. 1996) by users of a  thin-walled, red-slipped, and coral-sand-tempered pottery, formerly termed Mari- anas Redware but now perhaps better known as pottery of the Tarague Phase  </page> <page sequence="36"> 236 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  ---------------- (1500 to 500 Be; Butler 1994). There are very strong indications that this pot- tery may be closely related to the Philippine and early Talaud/Moluccan red- slipped assemblages described above, and all Micronesian archaeologists seem  to agree that the Mariana Islands were settled from the Philippines or northeast- ern Indonesia by a separate and possibly slightly earlier movement than that  indicated by Lapita in more southerly latitudes.  For Lapita itself, in Melanesia, there is less agreement, with many archaeolo- gists who undertake research in the Melanesian region continuing to claim that  Lapita origins reflect no significant contact with Indonesia at all and that all  Pacific populations are derived in isolation from the early settler populations of  western Melanesia in the Pleistocene. This view is to me completely at odds  with the evidence from linguistics and genetics, and is rejected here in its  entirety. The archaeological record alone is quite insufficient to prove or dis- prove movements of people in prehistory. Not only does the linguistic sub- grouping of the Austronesian family make a Southeast Asian source for Oceanic  Austronesian speakers almost unarguable (I say "almost," because there have  of course been processes of population contact and influence at work in Mela- nesia during the past 3,000 years that obviously make the picture less than  crystal clear), but we also have the striking fact that most Proto-Oceanic terms  associated with agriculture are derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian forebears  in Island Southeast Asia, rather than from the native Papuan languages of west- ern Melanesia. Although Papuan peoples had developed some forms of agricul- ture before Austronesians arrived, especially in the interior of New Guinea, little  of their knowledge seems to have been transmitted into those Lapita/Austrone- sian populations that moved eastward to settle Fiji and Polynesia. The "creoliza- tion" between Papuan and Austronesian cultures in western Melanesia occurred  later.  D. The Neolithic of Sarawak  As I have noted, the Neolithic period of western Indonesia is virtually a total  blank, despite the numerous reports of pottery from scattered sites in Java and  Sumatra, often cord-marked or carved-paddle-impressed in contradistinction to  that from eastern Indonesia (e.g., see Bronson and Asmar 1975 for Sumatra).  Unfortunately, these assemblages are so far undated and generally resist any his- torical interpretation. The situation is different for Sarawak, however, which has  a good sequence of Neolithic human activity covering the past 4,500 years from  the cave of Gua Sireh inland from Kuching-a sequence illuminated also from  the Niah Caves and from Lubang Angin Cave in the Gunung Mulu National  Park.  </page> <page sequence="37"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 23 7  1. GuaSireh  It will be remembered from Chapter 4 that the Land Dayak languages of west- ern Sarawak have linguistic features identified as a possibly Aslian (Austroasiatic)  substratum by Adelaar (1995). The work at Gua Sireh brings this observation  into especial prominence, although it should be stressed that the bulk of the  archaeological record during at least the past 3,000 years in Sarawak is likely to  be of Austronesian affinity. Nevertheless, the earliest Neolithic assemblages of  Gua Sireh have much in common with the Peninsular Malaysian and southern  Thai Neolithic, perhaps more than they do with the red-slipped wares of Sabah  and eastern Indonesia. This suggests that an Austroasiatic settlement of western  Borneo (and perhaps also parts of Sumatra) could have occurred before the  arrival of Austronesian populations in the region. The latter have come to dom- inate the linguistic scene, just as did their cousins who established the Chamic  (Austronesian) enclaves in formerly Austroasiatic regions of southern Vietnam  (see Chapter 9).6  The cave of Gua Sireh lies about 55 kilometers southeast of Kuching in west- ern Sarawak, in the limestone massif of Gunung Nambi. It is flanked by flat  alluvial terrain, used today and perhaps since about 4,500 years ago for the  growing of rice. The site was first excavated by Harrisson and Solheim in 1959,  then by Zuraina Majid in 1977, and most recently by Ipoi and Bellwood in 1989  (Ipoi 1993; Ipoi and Bellwood 1991). The Neolithic phase in Gua Sireh began  about 4,500 years ago with the appearance of pottery with carved, cord-wrapped,  or basketry-wrapped paddle-impressed surfaces. Other kinds of decoration such  as red slip or incision/punctation were virtually absent. Some sherds had rice  grain or husk inclusions, and a single rice grain in one sherd has been AMS  radiocarbon dated to an age of ca. 4,500 years. This is a highly important dis- covery, supported by conventional C14 dates from the same layer and more  recently by the discovery of many rice husk fragments in the soil of this phase  (Sen 1995).  This date for rice from Gua Sireh is the oldest evidence for putatively domes- ticated rice in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago and, as will be noted in Chapter  8, it is roughly contemporary with the plentiful evidence for rice in some sites  in central Thailand. Furthermore, the paddle-impressed pottery of Gua Sireh is  very different from the red-slipped Neolithic pottery of Sabah, the Philippines,  and eastern Indonesia (although some paddle-impressed pottery does occur in  these latter regions during the early Metal phase). The early date, the rice temper,  and the predominance of paddle impression on the pottery must open the pos- sibility that the assemblage reflects the arrival in Sarawak of a Mainland South- east Asian (Austroasiatic?) rather than an Austronesian population, although it  </page> <page sequence="38"> 238 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  should be noted that the mainland assemblages to be described in Chapter 8 are  only similar to Gua Sireh-not identical. The Niah caves, farther to the north- east, also have paddle-impressed pottery similar to Gua Sireh.  2. The Niah Caves and Gunung Mulu  I will now continue the Niah sequence where I left off in Chapter 6, Section IIA.  According to the original reports of Harrisson (e.g., 1957, 1958, 1959, 1970),  pottery first appeared in the West Mouth sequence at around 2500 or 2000 BC  together with quadrangular cross-sectioned adzes, which were preceded by an  earlier lenticular-sectioned form. Spriggs (1989:603) has since pointed out many  of the problems associated with the Niah C14 series and suggests that the oldest  acceptable Neolithic date from Niah is ca. 1400 BC. However, the Niah pottery  appears to be mainly of simple globular forms with plain or carved-paddle-im- pressed surfaces, and cord marking is rather rare (Solheim, Harrisson, and Wall  1959; Wall 1962; Zuraina 1982). The assemblage is similar to that from Gua  Sireh, and may be of a similar commencement date.  In the Niah Caves, and also in another cave called Lubang Angin in the  Gunung Mulu National Park (Ipoi 1993; Ipoi and Bellwood 1991), some very  striking types of non-paddle-impressed pottery made an appearance after about  /  Scm \  .....__  _,  Fig. 7.16 Double-spouted vessels from Lobang Jeragan, near Niah. From Harrisson 1971. Cour- tesy: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.  </page> <page sequence="39"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 239  1000 Be, especially as grave goods. These vessel types, which do not occur in  Gua Sireh, include closed water vessels with double spouts (Harrisson 1971) and  elaborately incised and painted "three-color ware," which has painted or im- pressed designs enclosed within incised lines (Fig. 7.16, Plate 36). The double- spouted vessels are unique within Island Southeast Asia but do have distant par- allels-possibly dated to about 2,000 years ago-in the Admiralty Islands to the  north of Papua New Guinea (Kennedy 1982). Because a fragment of bronze of  similar date has also been found in the Admiralties, presumably an import from  somewhere in Indonesia (Ambrose 1988), this distant parallel may reflect more  than coincidence.  The 1989 excavations in the cave of Lubang Angin in Gunung Mulu  National Park (about 160 kilometers southeast of Niah; Ipoi 1993; Ipoi and Bell- wood 1991) yielded extended burials wrapped in bark cloth and laid in shallow  pits in the floor of the cave; the grave goods seem to have been placed on the  surface. This has led to much mixture within the deposits, but as the material  culture is quite homogeneous the site might have been in use only for a rela- tively short period. The pottery contains some cord-impressed or carved-paddle- impressed vessels, together with double-spouted vessels identical to those from  Niah, large carinated vessels of three-color ware decorated with red and black  pigment (the third color being the surface of the pot) and complex designs of  infilled incision, and two unusual deer heads attached to a pottery vessel of  some unknown overall shape. The radiocarbon dates for Lubang Angin fall  between about 700 BC and AD 500, and as glass beads and iron fragments were  also found in the site it is possible that the assemblage spans the period (per- haps late first millennium Be; see Chapter 9) when these items were first intro- duced to the region.  The Niah and Lubang Angin three-color ware is similar to some early Metal  phase pottery from Sabah and especially the Philippines, where similar motifs  are tentatively dated in Manunggul Cave A on Palawan to the early first millen- nium BC (Fox 1970). The Manunggul pottery, like the Niah three-color ware,  has fairly exuberant incised curvilinear designs with punctate infillings. The  three-color decoration also resembles that on pottery from the upper layer at  Bukit Tengkorak in Sabah, dating after 300 BC (above), and also the undated  assemblage from Kalumpang in western Sulawesi. The interesting possibility  arises that this three-color pottery in these interior regions of Sarawak might be  a record of the inland expansion of Austronesian populations from coastal loca- tions some time in the early first millennium BC.  As far as the overall sequence of Neolithic activity in the West Mouth at Niah  itself is concerned, the general lack of information on habitation assemblages  forces one to turn to burial types and their associations. During the Neolithic,  an inner portion of the cave behind the area previously occupied in preceramic  </page> <page sequence="40"> 240 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  times was used for burial purposes. About 130 burials were excavated from this  "cemetery sector" prior to 1967; cultural details have been described by Barbara  Harrisson (1967). All graves are shallow and seem to belong to one continuous  phase of activity dated quite uncertainly to some time between 3000 Be and the  first millennium AD; dating was by a large series of thirty collagen or apatite  radiocarbon dates from human bone reported by Brooks et al. (1977). However,  these dates are of such extremely uncertain reliability and contain so many  internal contradictions that I refer below only to dates determined on other  materials, such as charcoal or shell.  The main burial types at Niah are as follows:  a. Extended burials, totaling sixty-eight, laid in shallow graves marked with  stakes, with (in most cases) heads pointing into the cave. Many skeletons  were coated with hematite or partially burnt, and it is interesting to note  that a similar incomplete burning of corpses has been reported ethno- graphically for Land Dayak groups in Sarawak (Roth 1896:137). At Niah  the bodies were placed in log coffins with plank lids or in cigar-shaped  caskets of sewn bamboo strips, and in some cases they were also wrapped  in pandanus mats before being placed in the containers. Some of the  burials in bamboo caskets were provided with pillows of wood, matting,  bamboo, or leaves. There are also traces of textiles with two burials that  are probably quite late in the sequence. Associated artifacts, possibly grave  goods, include a quadrangular adze, sherds of three-color ware, two bone  rings, and a wooden disc-shaped earplug. Later graves in this series have  glass beads and metal goods. Three radiocarbon dates from a mat and two  wooden coffins (burials 75 and 60: Harrisson 1975b; Harrisson 1967:154)  fall between about 1750 and 500 BC.  b. Cremations and burnt secondary burials. These two categories were sepa- rated by Barbara Harrisson, but it seems best to consider them together.  Fifty-nine were found (twenty-six fully cremated and thirty-three less  fully burnt), placed in small wooden coffins, pottery jars (Plate 37), or bas- kets. One was in a Chinese jar, presumably postdating AD 1000. Associated  goods for the whole group included quadrangular adzes, shell rings and  perforated discs, some double-spouted jar sherds, and a single copper  object. Two burial jars are dated to about 1500 BC (burial 69, and from  wood with burial 159; Harrisson 1968), and another burial jar to about  750 BC (burial 67). These dates for jar burial do seem a little early given  the patterning elsewhere in the archipelago, but similar dates in the late  second millennium Be for double-spouted sherds have been claimed from  two other caves near Niah: Magala and Lobang Jeragan (Harrisson and  Harrisson 1968; Harrisson 1971). The problem with Magala, however, is  </page> <page sequence="41"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 241  that the sherd concerned was found on the surface of the cave and not in  definite association with the bone that was dated.  The Niah evidence thus presents some major problems. On the one hand there  is a large series of radiocarbon dates, but mainly on bone collagen or apatite  and of uncertain reliability. On the other hand there are large numbers of arti- facts, but it is almost impossible to associate the vast majority of them in any  convincing way with the dated bones. Nothing short of massive reexcavation,  perhaps now impossible, can resolve this problem.  If the Niah dates are correct, the sequence there may indeed contain jar  burials from the late second millennium BC in fully Neolithic contexts, as now  appears to be the case in southern Vietnam (Ha Van Tan 1985b). I am also will- ing in principle to accept late second millennium Be dates for the double- spouted and three-color sherds, given the evidence from Lubang Angin. A few  other comments can be added to the Niah story. It is possible that a small  domestic dog was present in the Neolithic phase (Clutton Brock 1959; Medway  1977b) together with the domestic pig, although definitive evidence for the  latter before the fifteenth century AD seems to be lacking (Medway 1973; Cran- brook 1979). Neither the dog nor the domesticated species of pig (Sus scrofa) is  native to Borneo, and the native wild boar (Sus barbatus) appears never to have  been domesticated. Otherwise, the economic evidence from the West Mouth  suggests little real change from pre-pottery times, and it looks as if the site was  used predominantly for burial during the Neolithic-and perhaps for occasional  visits-rather than as a base for a sedentary agricultural population.  IV. AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF EARLY AUSTRONESIAN EXPANSION  If the linguistic data from Chapter 4 plus a number of important botanical and  ecological observations are added to the above archaeological record, then the  course of Austronesian prehistory from the Initial Austronesian settlement of  Taiwan (fourth millennium sc?) through about 1500 BC, when Neolithic voy- agers were beginning the Austronesian settlement of Oceania, can be recon- structed.  During the late fifth or fourth millennium BC, colonists from the mainland  of southern China (probably Zhejiang or Fujian) settled Taiwan. Initial Austro- nesian languages were spoken on this island for several centuries (a millen- nium?) before further expansion took place. During the third millennium BC  colonists moved into Luzon, and the Malaya-Polynesian subgroup now began  its separation from the other primary subgroups of Austronesian that remained  on Taiwan. The linguistic reconstruction for Prato-Austronesian (located on Tai- wan) reveals an economy with domestic pigs and dogs and cultivated rice,  </page> <page sequence="42"> 242 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  millet, sugarcane (perhaps domesticated from the wild Chinese species Saccha- rum sinense; Daniels and Daniels 1993), yams, and Alocasia (Wolff 1994; Zorc  1994). The archaeological evidence adds pottery, weaving, and bark cloth, plus  the stone and bone items (reaping knives, projectile points, adzes) already de- scribed for the Taiwan Neolithic.  By at least 2000 BC, Prato-Malaya-Polynesian began to break up, probably  with settlement expanding in various directions into the southern Philippines,  Borneo, Sulawesi, and the Moluccas. The Prato-Malaya-Polynesian vocabulary  items presumably reflect the tropical environments of the Philippines, and im- portant new items were added to the economic repertoire: the chicken, coco- nut, breadfruit, Colocasia (taro), banana, sago, betel chewing, and the addition  of sails to canoes. Of course, none of these items can be proven definitely  absent from the Prato-Austronesian vocabulary; all the linguistic evidence can  say is that it cannot be demonstrated that they were present. Certainly it would  not be at all surprising if taro and domestic fowl were present in the Taiwanese  economy at around 3000 BC. But breadfruit, coconut, banana, and sago were  most probably first incorporated into the Austronesian crop inventory in the  tropics.  By about 2000 BC the Central-Eastern Malaya-Polynesians had expanded,  presumably through the Moluccas, to at least as far as Timor. Navigational skills  and sailing techniques must have been improving by this time-as the impend- ing settlement of Oceania makes clear-and rapid coastal expansion was prob- ably preferred to the more laborious process of settling island interiors, which  might in some cases have sheltered hostile populations. Cereal cultivation  declined to only minor importance in eastern Indonesia, and the Austronesian  settlers of Oceania based their economy purely on tubers, tree fruits, and other  vegetatively reproduced plants. I will now fill out the botanical background to  these Austronesian adaptations by looking at some of the major crop plants and  at the dynamics of shifting cultivation.  A. Rice and Other Cereals  As indicated earlier in this chapter, the earliest cultivated rices developed,  according to the archaeological record, from wild annual or perennial forebears  in central China (Plate 38a). It is apparent from studies of modern varieties that  both the wild forms and the early varieties domesticated from them at this lati- tude would have been highly sensitive, during their growth and ripening cycles,  to variations in day length (photoperiod) and sunshine incidence (Oka 1988).  Flowering would have depended on latitudinally determined day length at the  start of the dry season, and the ripening process would have required about  forty-five days of dependable and adequate sunshine (Chandler 1979:44) and a  </page> <page sequence="43"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 243  precise progression of daylight durations (Oka and Chang 1960; Vergara 1976;  IRRI n.d.). In effect these cultivars were genetically conditioned for successful  growth cycles under specific latitudinal and climatic conditions.  Today, varieties with little or no photoperiod sensitivity have been developed  that will grow successfully in equatorial or high latitudes, but rice yields are still  highest in the intermediate tropical latitudes, especially where irrigation is car- ried out. They drop off (as do protein and starch contents) as one moves toward  the equator (Fig. 7.17). For the early centuries of Austronesian expansion it may  perhaps be assumed that all varieties were sensitive to daylight lengths, and any  attempts to move them relatively quickly into equatorial latitudes would have  met with either decreased harvests or no harvests at all (Spencer 1963:84). For  instance, excessive cloudiness or rain during the ripening period, high night  temperatures, and unvarying day lengths would in combination promote pro- lific vegetative growth, but grains would tend to be small and in many in- stances would probably never reach maturity (Oka 1975; J. H. Chang 1968).  Grains might also ripen in the middle of an exceptionally wet period so that  successful harvesting would be difficult or impossible.  tillilf,~  I~ -~ 11;::::::&lt;:i:i:i:i:i:41   ~2  1--x-:-a 3  c:::J 4 •((  Fig. 7.17 Present-day relationships between rice cultivation and environment: (1) "home" area of rice  where crop may be raised year after year without climatic modification; (2) important rice-producing  areas where at least one parameter of climate is frequently less than ideal for successful crops; (3)  areas where climate must be modified to produce a crop; (4) areas with no important rice production.

Many rice specialists have stressed the diffi- culties and drops in yields that result in changing from a monsoon to an equa- torial climate (see especially Spencer 1963); I have also summarized the basic  situation in more detail elsewhere (Bellwood 1980). As Austronesians moved  south toward the equator and east toward Oceania, rice evidently dropped out  of the crop repertoire until suitable southern hemisphere environments in Java  and Bali were reached. This, at least, was a scenario I favored for the first edition  of this book-a scenario basically driven by environmental factors-but now I  think it needs slight modification.  The environmental factors are of course unarguable and undoubtedly of sig- nificance. But earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 5, I raised the possibility- with Sather (1995)-that early Austronesian economies were varied and not en- tirely "standard agricultural." In other words, some groups probably grew rice  in sedentary terrestrial circumstances, especially in Taiwan and the Philippines.  Others adopted foraging, as some of the ancestral Punans of Borneo (Chapter 5,  Section I). Still others favored maritime specialization and mobility, as perhaps  the people of Bukit Tengkorak in the first millennium Be. It almost stands to  reason that the latter type of adaptation would be the one most likely to lead to  island colonization, and such people are perhaps the least likely to have had  sedentary rice-growing lifestyles. It is also salutory to note that the earliest colo- nists of the Pacific Islands, from Lapita at ca. 1500 BC through to the ends of  Polynesia (especially New Zealand) at about 900 years ago, generally adopted  mainly foraging economies in the first few centuries of settlement owing to the  profusion of natural resources. Of course, this behavior often led to rapid faunal  extinction, as in the case of the New Zealand moas (Anderson 1989). But these  populations never abandoned agriculture entirely and were able to revert to it  more and more in the later stages of prehistory.  The same might have happened in Island Southeast Asia. Those Austrone- sians who moved into Oceania abandoned rice cultivation and never thereafter  recovered it. Their cousins in much of Malaysia and western Indonesia, if the  historical and ethnographic records are any guides, recovered it with gusto (if  indeed any of them ever dropped it entirely, which is perhaps unlikely). The  archaeological record of rice cultivation, albeit faint, indicates this with clarity.  Rice is now well attested in Taiwan and western Borneo by 2000 BC, so its culti- vation was clearly known to many communities during the early millennia of  Austronesian expansion. Sites in central Thailand also have domesticated rice at  2000 BC (Chapter 8). Although Hill (1977) suggested that rice was of minor im- portance in Peninsular Malaysia prior to the period of Funan (early first millen- nium AD), I suspect future archaeological research there will push dates for rice  cultivation back to an earlier period as well. In eastern Indonesia, rice seems to  </page> <page sequence="45"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 245  ---------- have been less important than millet, yams, taro, and sago even as late as AD  1500 (Spencer 1966), although it clearly was grown in quantity in favorable  lowland regions of the Philippines and Sulawesi (e.g., see Pelras 1981 for Makas- sar). However, it is almost universally of great importance today in the islands  of western Indonesia, including equatorial Borneo and Sumatra, and may always  have been so throughout Austronesian prehistory in the monsoon islands of  Java and Bali.  Given the above observations, I would incline to the following view of the  prehistory of Austronesian cereal cultivation. Firstly, the northern populations  in Taiwan and Luzon have probably always cultivated rice and foxtail millet in  varying proportions, although the failure to find direct evidence of rice in the  oldest Neolithic sites of the TPK culture in Taiwan does raise some problems.  Other cereals of Southeast Asian origin, such as the perennial Job's tears and the  annual"Japanese barnyard" millet Echinochloa frumentacea (Li 1970), were prob- ably also grown on a minor scale as well.  A second stage of adaptation followed with expansion, probably involving  much coastal foraging mobility, into and beyond the southern Philippines after  2000 BC. The groups who moved toward Sulawesi and eastern Indonesia clearly  dropped rice to the scale of a very minor crop but probably continued to grow  Job's tears and some foxtail millet; I am unsure whether the latter would have  suffered the same traumas as rice during an equatorial shift. Foxtail millet, of an  apparently ancient and shattering variety, is still of importance in Halmahera  (Ishige 1980), in central Sulawesi (Downs 1956), and in other parts of eastern  Indonesia (Fig. 7.27). It has also retained considerable importance in Taiwan  and Lan Yi.i (Botel Tobago Island; Arnaud 1974; Fogg 1983).  The other side of this second stage concerns those groups who moved  toward western Indonesia, Peninsular Malaysia, and southern Vietnam. These  appear to have concentrated more on rice and possibly Echinochloa (which does  not occur in eastern Indonesia; see Fig. 7.18). Although millet has survived  ethnographically amongst the Senoi of central Malaya, there is a chance that it  may be a relatively recent introduction. Rice would undoubtedly always have  been important in the ideal soil and climatic conditions of magnificently fertile  Java and Bali. Nonphotoperiod-sensitive varieties better suited to an equatorial  climate may already have developed by the time the first Austronesians began  to settle Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.  B. The Tubers and Tree Fruits  As far as eastern Indonesia and Oceania are concerned, the equatorial shift dur- ing the second stage described above clearly led to a dominance of fruits and  tubers over cereals. Of the tubers, the most important are the aroids (Plate 39)  </page> <page sequence="46"> 246 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  = Ianger mollet  ..  .. -- .,.,. .. --- 0  .•  Fig. 7.18 The present eastern limits of cereal crops in the islands of Southeast Asia.

The greater yam (Dioscorea alata) has its homeland in the mon- soon regions of northern Mainland Southeast Asia (Burkill 1951) and may have  been cultivated by Austronesians throughout their prehistory. Other species of  yam were probably first domesticated in Sulawesi and the eastern Indonesia- Melanesia region (Coursey 1972, 1976). Today, yams survive as staples only in  </page> <page sequence="47"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 247  parts of Taiwan, Mentawai, and Banggai; wild yams still sustain some of the  hunters and gatherers, such as the Negritos.  The taro (Colocasia) (Plate 39 left) poses a more difficult origin problem since  it grows freely in a wild or feral state along river banks in many parts of South- east Asia and India. Its homeland, if it ever had a restricted one, remains  unknown (Barrau 1965; Yen and Wheeler 1968). Matthews (1995) has suggested  the ancestor of cultivated taro is a wild form, Colocasia esculenta var. aquatilis,  which grows widely from India to northern Australia and New Guinea; it could  have been domesticated on more than one occasion independently. The same  applies to the giant aroid Alocasia macrorrhizos, which has a similar widespread  distribution (excluding Australia and New Guinea). Colocasia attained some im- portance in the islands of Southeast Asia; it has been reported as a tradition- al staple in regions as far apart as Nias, parts of northern Borneo and north- ern Luzon, and Lan Yii. In the latter island it is grown by the Yami using  terraced wet-field techniques similar to those used widely in Oceania (Kano and  Segawa 1956). Both the aroids and the yams have probably given way in the  face of an expansion of rice cultivation in recent centuries, yet it is clear that  they were both of major importance in eastern Indonesia prior to AD 1500  (Spencer 1966).  Of the more important fruits, bananas were domesticated locally from  Eumusa species in Indonesia and Malaysia and from Australimusa species in the  Moluccas and New Guinea (Simmonds 1966). Wild forms of both still grow on  Halmahera today. Coconuts, despite a rather uncertain ancestry, may well have  been first domesticated (or at least systematically planted) in the Indonesian- Melanesian region. Coconut remains are common in Lapita sites in Melanesia  and coconuts from prehuman contexts have been excavated on Aneityum  Island in Vanuatu, far out in the western Pacific (Hope and Spriggs 1982). Har- ries (1978) believes the round-fruited and thin-husked form of coconut most  commonly grown today was first domesticated in Thailand or Island Southeast  Asia, but indigenous domestication of a long-fruited and thick-husked variety  in Island Melanesia is also possible.  The starch-yielding sago species (Metroxylon, Corypha, Arenga, and Caryota)  are also native to equatorial Indonesia and Melanesia (Ruddle et al. 1978), while  Eugeissona is restricted to Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. All have localized  roles in hunter-gatherer and agricultural subsistence in some swampy equatorial  lowlands, particularly in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia (e.g., see Ohtsuka  1977; Ellen 1978; Ishige 1980). These trees, together with the breadfruit, panda- nus, rambutan, durian, and other good fruit-bearing species, would all have  been available for systematic exploitation by Austronesian societies expanding  into equatorial Indo-Malaysian latitudes. Most were probably also exploited by  previous hunting and gathering groups, but full domestication and the devel- </page> <page sequence="48"> 248 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  opment of seedless varieties (as in the bananas and breadfruits) would have re- quired at least some conscious selection and planting.  C. Shifting Cultivation  Shifting cultivation of cereals is still practiced widely in Island Southeast Asia  today, in both equatorial and drier monsoon climatic regimes. The system obvi- ously varies tremendously from place to place depending on a number of social  and ecological factors, but it can support modern populations at densities of up  to sixty persons per square kilometer (e.g., see Freeman 1955; C. Geertz 1963;  Spencer 1966; Unesco 1978) or above in certain regions of high fertility such as  Java (Chin 1977). Compared to the average densities of 0.005 to 0.12 persons  per square kilometer given by Unesco (1978) for hunter-gatherers in tropical  forests, these figures clearly reveal the demographic significance of this type of  agriculture, even if they are small when compared to modern wet-rice popula- tion densities of up to 2,000 persons per square kilometer for Java.  Traditional systems of shifting cultivation in Island Southeast Asia normally  require short cropping cycles of one or two years to be spaced with much longer  fallow periods (e.g., see Freeman 1955; Rousseau 1977), when secondary forest  can reestablish itself and shade out the thick-rooted grasses that would other- wise take over and render future cultivation difficult (Seavoy 1973b). The whole  system depends a great deal on the nutrients provided by the burning of vegeta- tion prior to planting; most nutrients in tropical forests are contained in the  topsoil and vegetation rather than in the subsoil. If cropping continues for too  long, the topsoil may be eroded away or depleted in nutrients, and grasslands  requiring much more labor-intensive methods of cultivation will establish  themselves (this has of course happened in many areas). Prolific weed growth  can also promote frequent field shifts, since newly cleared plots require less  weeding than old ones (Clarke 1976).  This type of field shifting may eventually require village movement, al- though it need not necessarily require territorial expansion. For instance, the  Mnong Gar of Vietnam need to move their villages every seven years or so  (Condominas 1980), but they do so in a cyclical fashion so that an abandoned  locality will eventually be reoccupied after many years. The traditional system  of the Kayan of Central Borneo appears to have been similar (Hose and McDou- gall1912), with village moves occurring every twelve to fifteen years. However,  the Iban of Sarawak provide a classic example of a unidirectional type of expan- sion that has allowed single bilek families to move as much as 300 kilometers in  a single lifetime (Freeman 1955:25, 1970:286), through conscious selection of  virgin rain forest for new ricefields that are used only for one or two years until  weeds promote their abandonment. This phenomenal expansion is of course  </page> <page sequence="49"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 249  --~---~--------- relatively recent and it has involved iron tools and an unlimited expanse of rain  forest previously inhabited by only sparse populations, but it does still provide  an idea of how rapidly Neolithic cultivators could have expanded into virgin  agricultural territories when conditions were right. As the prehistory of Oceania  shows, Stone Age people can clear forest quickly, perhaps by using techniques  such as ring-barking rather than clear-felling.  Other features of modern shifting cultivation in Island Southeast Asia are  also of interest for possible reconstructions of how such systems might have  been managed in prehistory. For instance, most groups simply place seeds in  holes made by digging sticks in the untilled ash and topsoil, and the system  does not require tillage or plowing if it is maintained at a balanced level with  sufficient forest regrowth during fallows. Grasslands and greatly increased pop- ulation densities do of course require more intensive techniques of tillage and  mulching, as in parts of the New Guinea Highlands, but in Island Southeast  Asia it seems that intensification was directed much more toward the elabora- tion of wet-rice cultivaton, which I will discuss in more detail below. Most mod- ern shifting cultivators also mix their crops in the fields; for instance, the Iban  dibble in a few cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd seeds with the rice (Freeman  1955). This diversity may help to offset some of the risks associated with depen- dence on a single crop species and it may also help to discourage the depre- dations of crop pests and rats, which often tend to flourish in totally mono- cultural systems (e.g., see Takaya 1980 for modern rice cultivation and rat  infestation in lowland Sumatra). Planting in holes rather than direct broadcast- ing also allows for more conscious selection of seeds and thus for the develop- ment of different varieties.  V. THE STAGES OF AUSTRONESIAN AGRICULTURAL PREHISTORY  In a previous paper (Bellwood 1980), I concluded a discussion of Austronesian  agricultural prehistory by postulating four main stages of development. These  stages can be reduced to three for purposes of the following discussion, in  which I will expand on the types of cultivation practiced. The stages overlap in  time, although they are successive in terms of commencement, and each has  continued in some form to the present.  A. Stage 1  Stage 1 is the early phase of Austronesian expansion, centered in southern  China, Taiwan, and the northern Philippines. Incorporating the pre-Austrone- sian Chinese mainland sites, this phase can be dated between 5000 and 2000  Be. Economies seem to have had both maritime and agricultural economies in  </page> <page sequence="50"> 250 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  varying proportions, the latter with a cereal component including rice and fox- tail millet. As populations spread southward, rice might have continued to be  grown in localized swamp or alluvial backswamp conditions similar to those in  which its annual forebears originated. These were perhaps similar to those used  by modern Borneo peoples such as the Lun Dayeh (Padoch 1985) and Kantu  (Dove 1985), in which an initial labor investment can produce flooded fields on  riverine flats or in swamps that are easy to maintain and consistently produce  higher yields than dryland systems. However, as populations expanded in den- sity, cultivation surely developed more toward the shifting dryland form. Millet  can only be grown by dryland techniques, and the dry (or upland) rices were  probably developed secondarily at this time by selection for thick and deep  roots, loss of photoperiod sensitivity, and a tendency for early maturity to  escape the effects of drought (T. T. Chang 1976a; 1989).  B. Stage 2  The Austronesian expansion toward the equatorial zone after 2000 Be led to a  partial replacement of the cereals by the ecologically better adapted tubers  (especially the nonseasonal taro) and fruit or starch-bearing trees. The system of  shifting cultivation also underwent changes. During Stage 1, plot preparation in  the monsoon regions would have demanded a fairly complete clearance for  cereals (which need full sunlight), with successful burning of vegetation. In the  wetter equatorial zone, clearance would not have been so easy for a people with  only stone tools. Vegetation grows prolifically throughout the year and the rain  forest trees are more massive and could perhaps only be ring-barked. More im- portantly, heavy rain can make burning impossible (Freeman 1955; C. Geertz  1963). In Mindanao, yields can apparently double when a good dry period allows  a burn (Yengoyan, in C. Geertz 1963:22). So there would be obvious pressures  toward the development of cultivation systems requiring less forest clearance  and more emphasis on trees and tubers that do not require such broad expanses  of uninterrupted sunlight as cereals.  Systems of this type are still widespread in remoter parts of Indonesia and  Melanesia today. The Nuaulu of equatorial Seram (Ellen 1978) cultivate taro,  yams, bananas, and sago (wild sago stands are also exploited) in multicrop gar- dens where up to fifteen different species may be grown together (including  sugarcane, manioc, coconut, and others). Because the region has no dependable  dry season, up to ten burns may take place before planting can occur. If we sub- tract the iron tools these people now have, it is not difficult to see that large- scale garden clearance would not have been a very viable option for Neolithic  groups in such an environment. Another example comes from Mentawai, off  </page> <page sequence="51"> The Archaeological Record ofE arly Austronesians 251  the western coast of Sumatra, where sago, taro, and bananas are grown in  swamps with very little clearing and no burning-the cut vegetation is simply  used as a mulch (Mitchell and Weitzell 1983). Neither of these groups grows  cereals at all, and I rather suspect that systems of this kind, which were eventu- ally taken right through tropical Oceania, began to characterize Austronesian  economic patterns increasingly after about 2000 BC in the truly equatorial and  ever-wet lowland zone.  It should also be remembered that agricultural systems based on tubers and  tree fruits may have developed independently in New Guinea, although the  only direct evidence for this at present relates to a tradition of swamp drainage  for unknown cultigens (taro?) that commenced at about 7000 BC in the Wahgi  Valley, deep in the highlands of Papua New Guinea (Golson 1977, 1985). I have  mentioned the role of New Guinea in this regard several times previously, and I  have tried to make it clear that some parts of western Melanesia might already  have been settled by agricultural groups before the period of Austronesian  expansion (the biological and linguistic evidence both provide strong support  for this viewpoint). However, while such developments may have been of pro- found significance for western Melanesia, there is no compelling evidence at  the present time suggesting that they had any great effect on the development  of agriculture in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago.  C. Stage 3  By 3000 years ago most cultivation systems were probably still based on shifting  and localized swamp cultivation, with a predominance of cereals in northern  regions such as Taiwan and the northern Philippines, and perhaps in java and  some of the dry Lesser Sundas. Along the equator, cereal cultivation may have  been of importance in the western islands of Borneo and Sumatra, but there is  very good evidence that tuber and fruit dominance had long been developed in  eastern Indonesia and, of course, in Oceania. Prior to 3,000 years ago it is possi- ble that varieties of rice with low photoperiod sensitivity had developed within  the archipelago and that these rices (like weaving and the backstrap loom)  might have been undergoing geographical expansions in popularity through  quite a long period. However, the main features of Stage 3 as recorded histori- cally cannot really be stated to involve changes in crop dominance; instead it  appears that a major but regionally localized shift toward intensive wet-rice cul- tivation in bunded fields (sawahs) occurred, contemporary with but perhaps  independent of a similar shift to bunded field cultivation of taro in Oceania  (Kirch and Lepofsky 1993). Such bunded or embanked fields for rice utilize  water supplies derived either from wet-season rains (rainfed systems) or artifi- </page> <page sequence="52"> 252 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  cial canals (irrigated systems). Both rainfed and irrigated systems can be laid out  as a checkerboard network of bunds on flat land, or they may be terraced into  slopes and even steep hillsides (Plates 40 and 41).  It is most unfortunate that wet-rice cultivation, a system that in both irri- gated and rainfed forms has obviously transformed islands such as Java, Bali,  and Luzon, has no clear archaeological or linguistic prehistory in the Indo- Malaysian Archipelago. The massive success in the archaeological recognition  of ancient rice fields through excavations and phytolith analyses in recent years  in Japan suggests that modern technology might soon make some break- throughs, but the fact remains that none have occurred yet. On present evi- dence, mainly based on guesswork, any great economic importance for this  kind of cultivation prior to perhaps 2,500 years ago can hardly be assumed. His- torical records indicate wet-rice cultivation in northern Vietnam from about  200 BC (Wheatley 1965); here and in northern Thailand there is archaeological  evidence that wet-rice cultivation in bunded fields may have developed during  the Iron Age (after 500 BC), together with the use of water buffalo for plowing  (Higham 1989:198-200). In Java the oldest inscriptions referring to irrigation  (presumably for rice) date from the eighth century AD (Meer 1979). This is about  as far as the direct evidence goes, and at this rather vague level it is clearly inap- propriate to debate whether rainfed systems preceded canal-irrigated systems  (or vice versa), or whether both forms developed together as a result of local dif- ferences in topography.  But there are other important points to note about wet rice. Most modern  systems depend on iron and water buffalo for successful management, and this  has led to the idea that wet rice must be an Iron Age phenomenon. This, of  course, is not so, since the Polynesians managed quite well to develop and use  similar wet taro systems with only stone tools and no traction animals. Never- theless, there is no doubt that wet-rice cultivation as known today is mainly  (but not entirely) related to large, dense populations and the iron-buffalo com- plex of technology. It is not commonly found in regions of light population  and the system clearly flourishes best on fertile volcanic and alluvial soils, as in  Java and Bali, where it was so closely tied historically with the Indianized civil- izations that a major development during the first millennium AD must always  remain likely (there is no good evidence against this possibility). Wet rice in  these islands can support enormous populations as yields can be increased  through more careful field preparation, transplanting, and continuous cropping  through the year with irrigation (Geertz 1963). Wet rice also matures faster than  dry rice. The sawahs themselves can be cropped indefinitely in many regions  without fallows, partly because the irrigation waters carry nutrients and also  because fern-dwelling algae in the sawahs are efficient fixers of atmospheric  nitrogen.  </page> <page sequence="53"> The Archaeological Record of Early Austronesians 253  A major point here, of course, is that wet-rice cultivation on a given unit of  land can feed many more people than dry rice grown by shifting cultivation,  but the establishment of the necessary field systems does require a great deal of  initial labor. So it is hardly surprising that many shifting cultivators would con- tinue with swiddening unless obliged to intensify, perhaps owing to population  pressure (e.g., see Seavoy 1973a for Kalimantan), or in the face of managerial  demands for increased production to support a state or bureaucratic apparatus.  The Indianized civilizations may well have been able to enforce such manage- rial demands in Java and Bali, but explanations of this type hardly suffice for  wet-rice cultivation by the remote Kelabits and Lun Dayeh of inland Borneo  (Schneeberger 1979; Padoch 1983), or by the peoples of the northern interior of  Luzon whose magnificent terraces are amongst the most spectacular anywhere  in eastern Asia (see Plate 41).  The lfugao terraces of Luzon (Conklin 1980) comprise 20,000 kilometers of  embanked terraced fields, of which 7,000 kilometers are stone faced. They sup- port a relatively small-scale bilateral society with densities of between 100 and  250 persons per square kilometer. About one-half of lfugao subsistence needs  are also provided by shifting cultivation, and land does not seem to be in short  supply. According to Reid (1994d), the linguistic terminology for rice agricul- ture and terracing in northern Luzon descends from Proto-Nuclear Cordilleran,  a language that might have existed 1,500 to 2,000 years ago. There is as yet no  archaeological evidence to support this rough date, but it seems not unreason- able. The terraces are clearly not associated in any way with the presence of a  centralized authority or a master plan; they have probably been developed  piecemeal by wealthy but tribally organized families of high status, able to com- mand sufficient labor for construction and maintenance. The mountainous  Luzon terrain is obviously also suited to terracing in an aesthetic sense, and one  cannot entirely discount the importance of such a factor.  Perhaps I can draw one moral from this story: Wet-rice irrigation can exist on  a large scale without bureaucratic intervention of the type associated with the  ancient canal irrigation systems of Mesopotamia or northern China. This, as  pointed out by Bray (1986) for southern China, is because wet-rice irrigation  can operate as a piecemeal family or small group system, as with the subak irri- gation corporations of Bali. There is, therefore, a potentially optative basis to  the origins of wet-rice cultivation; the system need not always reflect the  demands of a state organization and a dense population, although history of  course shows that this has often been the case. Seemingly aberrant cases such as  Luzon and central Borneo are really rather hard to explain without at least a  partial model of free choice-and perhaps emulation.  Prior to AD 1500, sawah rice may have been the limit of intensification in the  Indo-Malaysian Archipelago, although I should perhaps mention the intensive  </page> <page sequence="54"> 254 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  tapping of the juices of the lontar palm (Borassus sundaicus) in Roti and Savu in  eastern Indonesia (Fox 1977). In addition, the modern story of the opening of  the lowland swamps of Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Irian Jaya to rice cultivation  (Collier 1979; Tsubouchi 1980) shows just how productive such apparently use- less environments can become, but this is a technology-based and organiza- tional option that probably would not have been at all attractive to, or even  feasible for, prehistoric Austronesian cultivators.  </page> </plain_text>
