LUCIA Introduction St. Lucia (Map 1) has a very long history of pottery production. The first evidence of pottery on the island dates from pre-Columbian times, that is, around AD 200. During that time a richly decorated pottery known as the Saladoid series was made. Quantitatively, pottery production reached its climax during late pre-Columbian times, with pottery from the so-called Suazoid series or Suazan Troumassoid subseries, as recently redefined by Irving Rouse (Rouse &amp; Morse 1995). It is assumed that Suazoid pottery, still regarded by today's islanders as "Carib" pottery, did not survive into the early colonial period and is therefore unrelated to the pottery of the con- tact-period Island Carib mentioned by the early and mid-seventeenth-cen- tury chroniclers of the Windward Islands. The slaughter of the Amerindian population on the islands by European colonists and the introduction of slaves from West Africa led to a breakdown of the indigenous culture and the replacement of the indigenous local pottery tradition by a series of Afro- Caribbean wares. From a technological point of view, the Afro-Caribbean ceramics can be regarded as local Caribbean adaptations integrating a blend of skills and techniques from African, European, and Amerindian - "Carib" - pottery manufacturing traditions both in form as well as in function (Heath 1999). However, there is no consensus among scholars regarding the exact composition of the influences going into the blend (Petersen, Waiters &amp; Nicholson 1999:160). The Afro-Caribbean wares once had a wide distri- bution throughout the Lesser Antilles, contrary to the present-day situa- tion. Traditional potters producing "folk pottery" survive to this day on the Lesser Antillean islands of Nevis, Antigua, Martinique (St. Anne), and St. New West Indian Guide / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids vol. 78 no. 1 &amp; 2 (2004):73-104</page><page sequence="2">Map 1 . Map of the Lesser Antilles, detail showing St. Lucia</page><page sequence="3">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 75 Lucia (Caraïbe Pointe, Morne Sion).1 Archaeological fieldwork on these and other islands has shown that it is often very difficult to distinguish the modern earthenwares that remain in use today from late pre-Columbian/early colonial Amerindian pottery.2 Yet, vessel shape, temper, and thickness of the ware are characteristics that may be employed to distinguish between the two traditions (Armstrong 1990; Meyers 1999:208). This paper focuses on the technological sequences of the pottery manu- facturing process through time, based on the fact that the successive tradi- tions are all characterized by handmade, low-fired pottery. We do not want to enter the debate regarding the so-called Island Carib problem, that is, the uncertainty about the identification of the archaeological ceramics that can be ascribed to the Amerindians of the colonial period of the Windward Islands, and the relationship of this earthenware with the modern folk pottery of the Antillean archipelago. While the Suazoid series has been seen as the material remains of the pre-Columbian ancestors of the historic Island Carib by Ripley Bullen and Adelaide Bullen (1972, 1976) and Dave D. Davis and Christopher Goodwin (1990) others, notably Louis Allaire (1977, 1984, 1991) and Arie Boomert (1986, 1995), have suggested that this pottery complex should dis- play features showing a derivation from the littoral portion of the Guianas and, moreover, a relationship to the present Karina (Carib) of this region. In addition, we do not want to participate in the current debate on Afro- Caribbean wares, which has tended to revolve around origin, stylistic diver- sity, and related ethnicity questions (Hauser &amp; Armstrong 1999; Heath 1999; Petersen, Watters &amp; Nicholson 1999). Rather, we provide a picture of the pottery manufacturing process on St. Lucia through time between diachronic, geographically bounded pottery traditions with markedly different origins. We do this by using the results of the analysis of Suazoid ceramics, combined with information gathered from the early ethnohistorical accounts from the Windward Islands and recent ethnoarchaeological fieldwork among tradi- tional potters on St. Lucia. An overview of pottery manufacturing techniques and production from late-pre-Columbian and present times follows, resulting in an insight into the whole sequence of operations of the manufacturing pro- cess embedded in the sociocultural realms of the Suazoid, Island Carib, and Afro-Caribbean cultures (see Lemonnier 1986, 1993; Gosselain 1998). It is believed that technological knowledge embedded in one society's manufac- turing tradition, which passes from generation to generation, is stable through time (Stark 1998; see also Hofman &amp; Jacobs 2001/2002). However, it can- not be assumed that this knowledge is transmitted from one tradition to the other. The manufacturing processes in the different cultural traditions should 1.

BRIGHT be clarified by comparing the production steps of each ware. The reconstruc- tion of the production technology involves, in all cases we present, identifying the raw materials used (like clay and temper), studying the shaping, finishing, and decoration techniques and firing process. By studying the changing social and cultural environment over a period of time, the developmental trajectory of the pottery manufacturing and the choices made by the potters will be given a place in the history of the island. HISTORIC PREAMBLE St. Lucia has a long habitation history that begins around AD 200 with the first Amerindian settlers on the island. These first inhabitants originated in the northern part of South America and brought ceramics from the Cedrosan Saladoid subseries with them. However, the island seems to have been most densely occupied during the later period of pre-Columbian times termed the Suazoid period (from approximately AD 1 150 to 1500). For the next few centuries the situation is less clear. The Lesser Antilles and the Windward Islands in particular have a markedly different colonial history from that of the Greater Antilles. The same lack of interest evinced by Columbus in bypassing swiftly the islas inutilas seemed to pervade the European attitude toward these islands for the century and a half after Columbus. Archaeology in the Leeward Islands has pointed to a possible depopulation of these islands, bar St. Kitts, Antigua, and Nevis, before the arrival of Europeans in the area. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this depopulation, ranging from resource deple- tion and Amerindians fleeing other Amerindians, to disease and slave trad- ing. European settlers pouring into the region from the seventeenth century onward reported most of the Leeward Islands to be deserted, some of them only recently. However, the Windward Islands and certain Leeward Islands harbored a more lasting and resilient Amerindian population, which initially offered considerable resistance to the foreign occupiers. The Island Carib, regarded as a post-Columbian culture, were the inheritors of all the cultural traditions of the native Caribbean people and the mainland Karina, and they temporarily manifested themselves on the almost empty stage of the early colonial period (Allaire 1977; Boomert 1986, 1995; Whitehead 1995:105). The French-Island Carib peace treaty of 1660 allowed the remaining Island Carib to seek refuge in reserves on Dominica and St. Vincent (Wilson 1997). Over the years, the reports of skirmishes and other contact dwindled, until the Amerindians were ultimately marginalized and relegated to the foot- notes of European colonial history. Of course, this is a rather general view that does injustice to the period of about two hundred years during which the Amerindian population of the Lesser Antilles, particularly the south, under-</page><page sequence="5">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 77 went a remarkable resurgence (Honychurch 1997). A final factor contributing to the decline of the Amerindian population and their cultural heritage was the influx of African slaves into the region, which resulted in the preserva- tion of certain indigenous elements and the introduction of new ones from Africa. A people known as the Black Carib, a fusion of Island Carib and escaped black slaves, offered considerable resistance to the European powers until they were finally defeated in 1797, ending Amerindian resistance in the Antilles (Boomert in press). Thus it is not surprising that the pottery produced by Africans newly arrived on the Leeward Islands showed little Amerindian influence (see Petersen, Watters &amp; Nicholson 1999) because there may have been few Amerindians left to pass on the tradition. On the other hand, because Africans did mix with the dwindling Amerindian population in the Windward Islands, they took over certain customs and aspects of material culture as part of the process of trans- culturation. An interesting dimension is added to the question of Amerindian influences by examining the Puerto Real ceramics on Jamaica. It has been sug- gested that a slave trade in North American, not Caribbean, Indians may have had a minor effect on Afro-Jamaican folk traditions (Meyers 1999). Map 2.

HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT On St. Lucia, the Amerindian presence was so lingering that it left its marks on eighteenth-century maps. Both Thomas Jefferys's (1699-1775) map of 1775 and a map drawn by J.N. Bellin (1703-72), dating to the mid- eighteenth century, make mention of an Amerindian locale along the coast near Anse Mabouya (Map 2). The dwellings were depicted in a cluster, accompanied by a notation refer- ring to Carib. While lacking extensive documentation on the Amerindians on St. Lucia during these times (but see Vérin 1961), archaeologists are aided by a body of mainly French chronicles focusing particularly on the Windward Islands and dating to the early colonial period.3 These documents form an invaluable account of early colonial-period interaction between Europeans and Amerindians and offer an overview of the customs and material culture of the Carib inhabitants of the islands. Although none of these documents deal with St. Lucia outright, the situation outlined in these writings must apply to a certain degree to St. Lucia and its variegated postcontact population. There are indications that people near Caraïbe Pointe on the west coast of St. Lucia have maintained a somewhat stronger link with their Amerindian roots than other St. Lucians (Vérin 1961, 1963). African slaves manned the many European plantations on the island, such as Balembouche Estate, La Haut, Fond d'Or, and others. Over the years, the different populations coalesced, and most mod- ern-day St. Lucians embody to a certain degree this mixed heritage. While under the yoke of European planters, these people managed to retain their own cultural traditions and belief systems, as well as their material expressions. St. Lucia had a comparatively late start economically, only turning into a sugar-producing economy based on African slave labor in 1765. However, the continual struggle for supremacy between the French and English, who were both bent on possession of St. Lucia for its importance as a military stronghold with its excellent harbor facilities, retarded exploitation of St. Lucia's economic resources. The island's economy suffered further set- backs in the wake of the American Revolution and through violent hurri- canes that destroyed many plantations. Fortunes vacillated between France and England, and St. Lucia exchanged hands countless times between the mid-eighteenth century and 1814, when the island was finally ceded to the British. Only then, at the start of the nineteenth century, did St. Lucia begin to prosper, with products like sugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton in full cultiva- tion (Ragatz 1963:218; Breen 1970:53). Archaeology on St. Lucia The island of St. Lucia played a central role in the earliest systematic study of Caribbean prehistory. Despite its early role in stimulating archaeological 3.

LUCIA 79 research in the Caribbean, very little formal archaeological work has been conducted on the island in the past twenty-five years. Notable exceptions are the research undertaken by the University of Vienna in the 1980s (Friesinger 1986; Friesinger &amp; Devaux 1983) and current research by the University of Bristol at historical sites. However, before these excavations, the last major field investigations were conducted by Marshall B. McKusick (1960) as part of his Ph.D. research in 1956 and 1957, William G. Haag (1964), and the Bullens (1970, 1973 with Branford); the last major summary of St. Lucian archaeology was compiled by Charles Jesse in 1960 and revised in 1968. In 2002, an international cooperative program was established between the St. Lucia Archaeological and Historical Society, the Florida Museum of Natural History, and the Faculty of Archaeology of Leiden University (Keegan, Hofman &amp; Hoogland 2002, 2003). The aims of this project are to develop an inventory of archaeological sites on the island, to develop a better classification of the unique styles of pottery and decoration found on St. Lucia and in a broader context in the Windward Islands,4 and to conduct ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological investigations on the island. FROM SUAZOID TO FOLK POTTERY The Suazoid series in the Windward Islands was preceded by a thousand years of successive pottery traditions, which originated on the mainland of South America. Early horticulturalists introduced ceramics of the Cedrosan Saladoid subseries into St. Lucia around AD 200. Ceramics of this series are characterized by their thinness, hardness, and overall quality. They are richly decorated with paint, incisions, and modeled-incised adornos. Cedrosan ceramics have been found on St. Lucia at the site of Grande Anse, Black Bay, and others. A Troumassoid series divided into Troumassée A and B developed around AD 350 and a late Troumassée around AD 750. The Saladoid-Troumassoid succession does not imply an interruption in sty- listic modes between the two series. Troumassée A corresponds well with Late Cedrosan Saladoid, and Troumassée B shows a clear continuity from Troumassée A. This smooth transition demonstrates an uninterrupted local development over time (see also Boomert 2000:244-45). 4. Following a culture-historical approach, studies of pre-Columbian ceramics from the Caribbean have long been oriented toward the construction of relative chronologies by means of typological frameworks and did not incorporate the sociocultural aspects of society. Most of these studies focused on stylistic aspects of decoration and morphology. Technological studies in which the whole sequences of pottery production are analyzed have rarely been conducted, but are certainly of increasing interest among Caribbean archaeologists and ceramologists (e.g., Hofman 1993; Bloo 1997; Curet 1997; Reed &amp; Petersen 1999; Hofman &amp; Jacobs 2001/2002).</page><page sequence="8">80 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT Troumassoid ceramics are thick with relatively soft, grit-tempered paste, which crumbles easily. Vessel shapes are varied; forms include boat-shaped, kidney shaped, pedestal, bottomless, double, hemispherical, and inverted bell- shaped bowls. Rims tend to be thickened with a variety of forms including flanges and rim bevels. Painted decoration is common, including bichromes and polychromes with red, white, and black. Some modeled-incised motifs are present. Over time the painted decoration disappeared, as did fine-line crosshatching. Tripod griddles were introduced and modeled-incised deco- rations became more elaborate. The type-site for the Troumassoid series is the site at Troumassée River, St. Lucia. Troumassoid ceramics are found all over the Windward Islands (Troumassan Troumassoid subseries) and in the Leeward Islands (Mamoran Troumassoid subseries) (Petersen et al. 2004). From AD 1150 on, the Troumassoid series was followed by the Suazoid series, or Micoid series, as it was called by McKusick (1960). This series includes the Choc style, named after the site in the northwestern part of St. Lucia, and the Fannis style is named after the proprietor of a property at Micoud on the southeast coast (McKusick 1960:152-54; Jesse 1968a). The Suazoid series extends from as far south as Tobago to as far north as Martinique and Les Saintes (Boomert 1986, 1995; Allaire 1991; Hofman 1995). Recently dis- covered sites on St. Lucia that yielded late Suazoid pottery are Saltibus Point, Pare Estate, and La Ressource (Keegan, Hofman &amp; Hoogland 2002, 2003). Several researchers have focused their attention on the origin and devel- opment of the Suazoid series, which includes the latest pre-Columbian pot- tery of the Windward Islands. The discussion began in the late 1950s when McKusick identified ceramics of the Fannis style on St. Lucia that resembled ceramics made by local potters today. He further suggested that Fannis would be ancestral to the Island Carib pottery described by the early and mid-seven- teenth-century French chroniclers. These chronicles describe a number of characteristics regarding their fabrication, vessel type and their nomencla- ture, surface treatment, and function (see also Barbotin 1974; Allaire 1977; Boomert 1995:25). Despite several attempts, Island Carib pottery has never been positively identified in the archaeological context, and Suazoid pot- tery seems to have little in common with Island Carib pottery (Allaire 1977; Boomert 1995). Other attempts to correlate the Island Carib with similarly late complexes on the islands such as Cayo also have never been fully accept- ed and are still the subject of exploration and discussion (Boomert 1986, 1995). The current scenario views Karina people (predominantly men) with their pottery traditions coming from the mainland to the Antilles during late prehistory and replacing the Suazoid culture. This would explain the resem- blance of Kari'na vessel types to those described by the seventeenth-century chroniclers. Boomert ( 1 995 :28, 31) claims that Island Carib and Kari'na pot- tery both developed from one and the same predecessor (i.e. the Koriaban subseries), the most widespread Amerindian cultural tradition of the Guianas</page><page sequence="9">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 81 in late prehistoric times. Cayo pottery, which is very similar to Koriabo pot- tery from the mainland and which has been found on St. Vincent and spar- ingly on Grenada and Dominica, would then be the pre-Columbian precursor of the historic Island Carib pottery styles (Boomert 1986). Recently, Cayo pottery has also been reported for Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe (Richard 2002, 2003), and St. Lucia. Similarly, several attempts have been made to correlate Island Carib pot- tery with modern folk pottery (Fewkes 1914:675). However, with the excep- tion of some similarities in techniques and the survival of a few indigenous names for specific vessel types, little correlation has been found as yet (Vérin 1963; Jesse 1968b; Allaire 1977). In fact, the colonial or Afro-Caribbean ware, which dates back to at least the early eighteenth century, is more likely to be ancestral to modern folk pottery (e.g., Petersen, Waiters &amp; Nicholson 1999). It seems that a considerable number of studies have focused on the production sequences of the earthenwares that are associated with African populations in the Caribbean.5 Although the precise date cannot be pinpointed, it is appar- ent that African slaves started making pottery soon after they arrived in the Antilles. These wares probably circulated in an internal or "underground" economy initially, before gradually reaching colonial markets as well (see Meyers 1999). This pottery bore little resemblance to either European or Amerindian ware, although certain production techniques or conventions may have been similar. These earthenwares have come to be known under a variety of monikers, including Yabbas or Creole (or criollo) ware, African ware, Afro-Caribbean pottery, colono-wares, and folk pottery (perhaps the least pejorative and most inclusive term). Island-specific designations such as Afro-Jamaican and Afro-Cruzan also exist. It should be pointed out that the more general terms mentioned above have not been applied to Caribbean contexts exclusively; they are also applied to North American contexts. Most studies have yielded similar conclusions on the ceramics. The authors agree that these wares began to appear in the seventeenth century (and in some places even earlier, see, for example, sixteenth-century Cristophe Plain ceramics from Puerto Real, Jamaica), as a result of intermingling between indigenous peoples and African slaves, and that was in turn influenced by colonial pottery traditions. As far as manufacturing processes are concerned, the techniques applied to the northern Lesser Antilles Afro-Caribbean ware included coiling and hand modeling rather than wheel manufacture, and open firing (low-fired) conditions rather than firing in a kiln. Furthermore, little or no use was made of glazes, and the pottery tended to be heavy and coarse.6 Kiln-fired and wheel-thrown pottery has been termed Euro-Caribbean pottery, 5.

BRIGHT although it appears that there are exceptions to this rule, such as the wheel- and-kiln, slave-produced sugarpot industry of Barbados (Meyers 1999:207- 8). Interestingly, a correlation may exist between Amerindian pottery and folk pottery in terms of the mineralogical content of the pastes (i.e. predominantly local provenance), whereas the Euro-Caribbean pottery is more likely to have completely divergent pastes, often imported from different locales (Meyers 1999:206). From the mid to late eighteenth century, folk pottery manufacturing seems to have gone through a period of declining production, perhaps giving way to inexpensive, imported ceramics and cast-iron pots (Armstrong 1990:157). By the early nineteenth century interest in the imports waned, and folk pot- tery went through a resurgence that lasted until the onset of industrialization and the modern era. Folk pottery now leads a rather marginal existence, often in the more rural settings some distance from towns and cities, and predomi- nantly among poorer members of society. Very little is known about gender and Afro-Caribbean pottery manufacture in colonial times, because the very phenomenon of Afro-Caribbean pottery has gone unstudied until recently. Contemporary Afro-Caribbean pottery is made exclusively by women, how- ever (Handler 1964; Petersen, Watters &amp; Nicholson 1999). Besides the wide- spread local use of clay pots, most pottery production is oriented toward mar- kets and the tourism industry. Morphology and Style Suazoid pottery in the Windward Islands, including the Troumassan and Suazan subseries, comprises both a coarse and a fine ware (Boomert in press) (Figure 1-2). Dominant vessel shapes of the coarse ware include simple con- tours, often with unrestricted or independent restricted orifices. Most vessels are thick and poorly made and tempered with a great variety of materials. Surfaces are often scratched or scraped, but polished surfaces occur as well. Rims are simple rounded, rounded and slightly thickened, or inward thick- ened. Finger-notched rims are predominant in the later phase of the series. Bowls may have wide or flat handles, extended rim handles or rim lugs. Peg- shaped lugs are sometimes added to the end of bowls. Bases tend to be flat, but low ring bases and legs are present as well. Along with that coarse ware, there is a finer ware with more composite, complex, and boat-shaped vessels made of hard-fired, fine clay and with polished surfaces. Decoration on these vessels tends to be garish - finely or heavily incised lines in parallel designs, circles and dots, wings or scrolls on the rims or exterior sides and complicated modeled-incised lugs, frequently with human faces. These faces are flat, with appliquéd noses and eyebrows, punctate or slashed mouths, nostrils and eyes, and pierced ears (Rouse 1992: 129). Red paint is common overall, and bichrome is rare.

Anthropomorphic adornos</page><page sequence="12">84 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT are legs and footed griddles, pot stands, spouts, body stamps, spindle whorls, pierced cylinders known as loom weights, freestanding (female?) figurines and clay pestles.7 These clay pestles may also be decorated with anthropo- morphic or zoomorphic figures. On St. Lucia this series includes the Choc and Fannis styles. The Choc style is characterized by a paste that is grit-tempered and hard. Coiled con- struction is often apparent from unsmoothed surfaces. It is characterized by extreme simplicity of vessel form with round or slightly concave bases. Annular bases are rare. The presence of bowl legs in addition to tripod griddles is typical, decoration is simple, and emphasis on unthickened rim lips, thickened rims are uncommon and only appear in combination with red paint. The surface finish tends to be coarse, brushed or uneven, rather than smooth. Decorated pottery only exists in the form of red paint with a deeper and darker red than the lighter Troumassée reds. Incision occurs, with a typical design being horizontal bands alternating with a vertical line or dot. Choc style is very distinctive from Troumassée pottery. However, its overall appearance is nondiagnostic as a result of the simplicity and relative crudity of sherds (McKusick 1960:115, 141-42). The Fannis style shows continuities from the Choc style in the exclusive use of overall red paint and the absence of limited-area red. The paste is grit-tempered, black, and hard. There is a trend toward heavier and thicker pottery. Several new vessel shapes were introduced, including shallow, very crude, tripod and tetrapod bowls and large globular pots with slightly flaring rims. Vessel shape is frequently asymmetrical or irregular. The Fannis style sees the introduction of notched rims, elbow-shaped legs, crude spouts surmounted by a horizontal loop handle, legged ringstands, and more frequent use of modeled-incised designs. Crude, irregular incision also occurs along with finger indentations on the rim (McKusick 1960:116-17). Regarding Island Carib pottery, the early chroniclers mention different pot- tery vessel types, each with a specific function. Most pots that were used for cooking were raised over the fire by resting them on three stones, the man- bácha (Breton 1892:350).8 The most recurrent vessel types are the canalli , the boutéicha, a cooling jar, the chamacou , the taóloüa , the oúchou, a clay pot to heat the oiiicou , the roiiara , the iáligali, the toúrae , a kettle, pot, or marmite to cook vegetables, fish, and meat which resembled the roüara.

BRIGHT tomáli-ácae (male form) or toma-hiem (female form)9 is the pot in which one makes a sauce of crab and pepper, the so-called pepperpot, the balábi , dish or plate and last but not least the boutalli, which is the griddle for baking cassava (Breton 1892:67, 93, 94, 107-8, 418, 467, Barbotin 1974) (Figure 3). The eighteenth-century Anonymous of St. Vincent mentions "for their pottery utensils, their principal ones are two large vessels, one to hold water and the other to hold oiiicou , . . . one or two marmites, and a vessel to store the roucou . . . They also make a number of others more or less big for other purpose" (Pinchón 1961 :79).10 The canalli or canari is a vessel with a big orifice meant for storage of dry food and liquids. Breton mentions "f. canali" (Breton 1900:59) which means that this is a word used by the women. There are also the words mónca , imouca- li , which he translates as "canari, my canari" (Breton 1892:361). Various sizes exist, and the contents could range from six to fifteen liters. The Anonymous of Carpentras (Moreau 1987:132) is more precise about the size and adds, and when they want to make their wine, they have large vessels which are named " canali" which have no other use, and contain close to a muid [also spelled muiz; 3,456 liters], and similar height, of which the base is like a plate, becoming ever broader toward the end, which is sometimes four to five feet in diameter. There are also smaller ones that are used when their feast is not so large.11 According to de la Borde (1674:20, fig. 3, 8, 10), "the canary is a clay ves- sel with a pointed base" (Figure 4). 12 This vessel could also be used as a vessel for boiling and fermenting cassava beer or oiiicou (Breton 1892: 107; 9. It appears that two categories of vessels can be distinguished in Island Carib earth- enware. The first one is associated with the male sphere of activities, bearing Cariban names; the second one with the female sphere, bearing Arawakan and European names. The first category includes well-finished, more or less ceremonial wares for commu- nal use during meals ( chamacou , taóloiia, and the toma-hiem ), the second is related to domestic use ( rouara , bourrelet) (Boomert 1995:25). 10.

"Et lorsqu'elles veulent faire du vin, elles ont des grandes terrines qui se nomment ' canali ' qui ne servent à autre usage, et contiennent aucune près d'un muiz, et hautes de même, dont le fond est comme une assiette, s'élargissant toujours jusqu'au bout, qui a quelquefois quatre ou cinq pieds de diamètre. Il y en a bien aussi d'autres plus petites qui servent lorsque leur festin n'est guère grand" (Moreau 1987:132). 12.

Bottom half: drawing of canary by de la Borde (1674) Moreau 1987: 132). 13 De Rochefort (1658:436) reported that the small ones (called taumalis) were used for stew (pepperpot), and the large ones were used to make their drink, the oiiicou. 14 Barbotin (1974:plate VI) believes that the canari was placed over the dead body, to contain food for the after- life. This detail, however, is not mentioned by Breton. Others believe that the term canalli was used for all the domestic pottery and that the pot had multiple functions (Boomert 1986:99). According to Lóven (1935:249) it could be of Spanish origin and a copy of the Spanish olive oil jars (see also du Tertre 1973: 1 11). The term is still often used today in the Guianas and on the islands. Conaree is used on the British islands to describe iron cooking vessels with a restricted opening.15</page><page sequence="16">88 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT Concerning the chamacou , the taóloiia, the roiiara , and the iáligali Breton (1892:107-8) writes: The first two serve to pour oüicou, which has boiled and is passed around, we pose them in front of them, full instead of jugs, there are those which can contain twenty to thirty pots, the others have smaller ones, depending on whom they are presented to; the third one serves to cook potatoes; the fourth one serves to roast fish, there is a fire underneath and at the mouth below on several rocks. In order that the fire has air [can breathe], it is narrow at the top, the top is decorated with small sticks that are laid across and on which they put the fish, which can slowly cook over a low fire (the heat is conserved within the canari).16 Regarding the latter, Breton (1892:267) adds, " iáligali oulépe ábarou mónca , the canari , which has no ass."17 Concerning the boutalli (male) or bourrêlet (female), Breton (1892: 93-94) reports more extensively, "it has the shape of a griddle on which the women from that time dry their starch [paste] and of which it retains the name, it is of clay, placed on three stone rocks elevated half a foot or more, heated by the fire, the manioc flour is poured over to be baked on it, such is the oven of the savages."18 La Borde (1674:25) mentions in addition the dimensions of the griddle, "the griddles are made from clay one finger across in thickness, round, and one foot and a half in diameter: they put them on three stones or rocks large enough to serve as a support and put fire underneath."19 The Anonymous of Carpentras speaks instead of the toucqué as being the griddle and describes the use of three stones underneath (Moreau 1987: 13 1).20 Breton (1978:46) also mentions the toucqué in this respect but as being used without stones. 16. "Les deux premiers seruent à mettre l'oüicou qui a boüilli, &amp; qui est passé, on les pose deuant eux, pleins au lieu de pots, il y en a tel qui contiendra vingt à trente pots, les autres sont plus petits, suiuant les gens ausquels on les presente: le troisième sert à faire cuire des patates: le quatrième sert à faire rostir le poisson, il y a du feu dessous, &amp; á la bouche en bas sur quelques roches, affin que le feu aye de l'air, il est estroit par haut, le dessus est garny de petits bastons qui font en trauers, sur lesquels ils posent les pois- sons qui cuisent à loisir, &amp; souuent à petit feu (la chaleur se conseillant dans le canari)" (Breton 1892:107-8). 17.

LUCIA 89 Finally, Breton (1892:94; see also Breton 1900:98) describes the boutéi- cha as a "clay pot in which the Spaniards put their wine, the French use it to get water and call it jar"21 The chronicles mention particularly large sizes for some of the vessels, which consist mostly of open bowls and necked jars with pointed and rounded bases and sometimes handles (see Boomert 1995:26). Breton mentions liále tomáli ácae , the body of a clay pot (Breton 1892:266) and tiále, the body of a bottle (Breton 1900:98). The upper part of a pot or vessel is named tioúma, atálouragle (Breton 1900: 115). Breton mentions cambakêtáali liràcaeáli, the canari is cracked or broken (Breton 1900:171). He further mentions arerá- tina, meaning "piece" or "scale" (sherd) of "broken pot" (Breton 1892:51) or barrerátina, talouláchagonê, piece of broken pot (Breton 1900:291). This could indicate that broken potsherds were of particular importance and may have been reused for other purposes (see Allaire 1977:5 1). Vessel types that are popular in the folk pottery on St. Lucia today include simple shapes such as the kannawi ( canari ) or cooking pot and the bésin (basin), which is a large bowl. The kannawi is a vessel with a simple contour and a handle at opposite ends. The dimensions of this vessel vary from small to very large. For cooking, these pots are put on three stones called fouyé (foyer). The tèson (tesson?) or coal pot is an outward flaring vessel sometimes with finger indentations on the rim, wider at the top than at the bottom. Figure 5. Assorted folk pottery vessels (Morne Sion, St. Lucia) 21.

HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT A perforated base separates the top from the bottom, which has an opening for the placement of fuel. The chòdyè ( chaudière ) is a large, flat-shaped ves- sel for frying. This flat-shaped pot is placed on top of the coal pot. Then there is the pòt a flè ( pot à fleur), the flowerpot, the jar {jarre) as a water container, the pia (plat), to put food on at meals, the téwin (terrine), with two loop handles to wash or cook food or used as water container, and a pot (name is undetermined) to store (Figure 5). Finally there is the platin (platine), a very large plate to bake cassava bread.22 The rim portion of some vessels is occasionally decorated with finger indentations. The Pottery Manufacturing Process Clays are ubiquitously available in the southern part of St. Lucia, and it seems that from pre-Columbian times through to today they have been used for the local manufacture of pottery. The pre-Columbian clays from St. Lucia have local provenances. Fabrics of the pottery from Saltibus Point are of volcanic origin and have a consistent quantity of quartz. This may point to an origin in the island's youngest volca- nic deposition (Belmond Pumice). Fabrics are quite uniform and only differ in the proportion of volcanic rock versus mineral inclusions (plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, augite) (Faupl 1986). At Giraudy, the Bullens (1970:68) identified Suazoid fabrics characterized by grit- and crushed-shell temper. Suazoid shaping techniques involve coiling, but techniques such as flat- tening, slab building, pinching, and molding were also employed. Ceramic or calabash molds were probably used for the latter technique (Hofman &amp; Jacobs 2001/2002). These techniques have been applied independently, but also in combination, depending on the size and shape of the intended vessel. Scraping has been done with a shell or calabash sherd (Hofman &amp; Jacobs 2001/2002). Vessels have rather thick walls and a clumsy appearance. Finishing techniques include smoothing, burnishing, and polishing with a polishing stone, although most Suazoid vessels are crudely finished and often have scratched surfaces. These scratches are a result of rubbing the surface with grasses when the clay was in a leatherhard condition. Decoration com- prises finger-notched rims, incisions, and modeled human figures. Vessels have fired in an open fire in a rather controlled way, under oxidizing to neu- tral conditions at temperatures generally not exceeding 800° C. The fire was built up as an open structure, so that the wind could blow through it. Vessels were placed upside down in the fire to obtain a more equal spread of the heat. Alternatively, firing furniture (e.g., rocks or broken vessels) could have 22. The terminology for the various vessel shapes is given in patwa or patois, the kwéyòl or Creole language spoken on St. Lucia today (Frank 2001).</page><page sequence="19">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 91 been in the lowest part of the pile for the same reason (Hofman &amp; Jacobs 2001/2002). The chroniclers mention that in Carib Island society, probably women were usually the potters. As de la Borde (1674:21-23) writes, "the men are so fool- ish, and so ridiculous, that they do not want to have touched the labor, nor to put their hands on women's tasks, although they can do as well as they. For example, they would rather starve than make the cassava, make the kettle, the canary, plant the manioc." "The women are less idle than the men, they are like their slaves . . . They make the hamacs , look for firewood, make palm or calaba oil; they make the roucou , comb and titivate each other, prepare the couy , and the calabashes, make the ouïcou [cassava beer], the canaries , the griddles and kettles."23 Other sources are more equivocal as to the sex of the potters (Pinchón 1961:72; see also Petitjean Roget 1995). The clay used to make these pots is called allinéteu {terre à pottier) or Teútêli (Breton 1 892:29, 458). An anonymous manuscript from the early eighteenth century on St. Vincent adds the following regarding the manufacturing process: These utensils [pots] were made of certain clay or greasy earth, well moistened and well kneaded, which they find at the foot of the hills, but, because they are no potters and because they do not have wheels, this is how they proceed: they collect quantities of this greasy earth, which they expose to the sun to dry it out and make it into dust. It is then passed through various sieves until all the rocks are gone. It is then kneaded with a little water and the gum of certain wild palm trees to consolidate the paste. They then take the necessary quantity, which they spread on a flat stone and little by little gets a larger width, and if it is to make a pot, while it hardens, they carefully raise the edges of that paste, which they bring closer to the centre by raising it higher, then with the palm of their hands, just like our potters, they shape the bottom while at the same time with their other fingers, they polish the exterior and close the cracks produced by making it round. Finally, they have a pot, but they have no proportions, nor determined shapes and very little solidity, while being too massive in some places and too brittle in others. They often even have difficulties using them when they are dry because since the base is not exactly flat, it tends to lean more on one side than the other. Regarding the large vessels I marmites ], there is more time and work needed. After they finish making them, they have to look for the most friable parts and cover them with slip 23. "Les hommes sont si sots, &amp; si ridicules, qu'ils ne voudraient pas avoir touché à la besogne, ni mettre la main au travail des femmes, quoy qu'ils peussent faire aussi bien qu'elles. Par exemple, ils mourroient plûtost de faim que de faire de la Cassave, faire la marmite, le Canary, planter le Manioc ... Les femmes sont moins oysives que les hom- mes, elles sont comme leurs esclaves ... elles font les amacs, cherchent le bois pour le feu, font l'huile de Palmiste &amp; de Calaba; elles font le Roucou, peignent et ajustent les autres, accomodent les Couy s, &amp; les Callebasses, font l'Oiiicou, les Canaris, les platines, &amp; les marmites" (de la Borde 1674:21-23).</page><page sequence="20">92 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT both in the interior and exterior, and then with a fish scale or cutting stone, they polish them in the way that the vessels do not tend to crack when put to the violence of the fire (Pinchón 1963:78-80).24 This manuscript mentions the following regarding the drying process: "to dry their vessels, the Carib keep in their dwellings an area built for that purpose, sheltered from the sun and where they manage to keep some wind through the openings in the walls . . . they [finally] put them near a large fire, which gives them a good firing without cracking them" (Pinchón 1961:79- 80).25 About the firing du Tertre 1973 (1621:326) says that after piling the fuel all around and over them, they set fire to it, producing a slow fire, which baked the vessels as well as the European furnaces. Vessel surfaces were smudged. Breton (1892:13) mentions achálaca coina, "making the black, heating gum from the elemi under a clay pot"26 24. See also Allaire 1977:46; Petitjean Roget 1995:166. The information used by Father Pinchón comes from an eighteenth-century anonymous manuscript on the Carib of St. Vincent. Allaire (1977:46-49) cites this source extensively. His translation of the original French text is partly used here. "Ces ustansils sont faits avec une certaine argile ou terre grasse bien détrempée et bien paitrie qu'ils trouvent à la chute des montagnes, mais, comme ils ne sont point potiers et qu'ils n'ont point de tour, voicy comme ils s'y pren- nent: Ils ramassent quantité de terre grasse, qu'ils exposent au soleil pour bien la sécher et la metre en poussière; ils la passent dans différents tamis jusqu'à ce qu'il n'y reste aucune pierre, ils les paitrisent ensuite avec un peu d'eau et de la gomme de certains palmiers sauvages pour consolider cette patte; ils en prennent ensuite la quantité néces- saire pour l'ouvrage qu'ils se sont proposés, qu'ils étendent sur une pierre plate et peu à peu luy donne une grande largeur, et si c'est pour en faire un pot, à mesure qu'elle durcit, ils soulèvent doucement les extrémités de cette pâte qu'ils raprochent du centre en l'élevant, et, avec le poulce, ainsy que nos potiers, ils forment le fond dans le tems qu'avec leurs autres doigts ils en polissent l'extérieur et cimentent les fentes qui se fer- ment par l'arrondissement ; enfin avec l'aide du tems, ils ont un vase, mais qui n'a ny proportions, ny figure déterminée et très peu de solidité et est trop massif en certains endroits et trop foible dans d'autres ; souvent même, ils ont peine à s'en servir quant il est sec, parce que, la base n'étant exactement plate, il penche plus d'un côté que d'autre. A l'égard des marmites, il leur faut encore plus de tems et travail, car après qu'ils ont fait cette marmitte, il faut qu'ils cherchent les endroits les plus foibles pour les enduire avec de la terre glaise tant en dedans qu'en dehors, et ensuite, avec une écaille de poisson ou une pierre tranchante, ils le polissent de manière que le vase soit uni de crainte que la violence du feu ne le fasse éclater" (Anonymous 1961:78-80). 25. "Pour faire sécher leurs vases, les Karaybes ont dans leur habitation un endroit fait exprès, à couvert du soleil et où ils ménagent un peu de vent par les ouvertures qu'ils y font, et quant ils ont assez secs, ils les mettent auprès d'un grand feu qui leur donne une bonne cuisson sans les faire fender" (Anonymous 1961:79-80). 26.

LUCIA 93 and achalácani , "is the smoke or soot of this gum, which adheres to the canari and which makes this nice black color."27 All over red painting and black motifs on a red background have been reported for additional serving cups and bowls made out of calabash (como- ri, rita , lita, taba) by the Anonymous of Carpentras (Moreau 1987:108-9; see Boomert 1995:26 who erroneously classifies these categories as earthen- ware). "The comori , in which they put the wine that they want to take out of the villages ... which is similar to the rita, is painted red, and the rita , which is to put water in is not. And the one that is to serve wine also named rita is painted red with black designs on top."28 The Anonymous of St. Vincent also describes the painting of the calabashes in addition to their engraving (Pinchón 1961 :81), "they paint this vessel with different colors, and decorate it with different motifs and use for this painting the juice of certain trees which is like a varnish which conserves this fruit in all its beauty and prevents the heat or the humidity from causing alterations or fissures."29 Women manufacture today's "folk pottery" (Figure 6). However, men may assist in carrying out of some tasks, such as quarrying the clay and cutting the wood for firing. Clays (tè gwä) are collected from neighboring quarries. The potter may, in some cases, have to pay for the clay if the "quarry" does not belong to her. When quarried, the clay is put into piles. The people from the village know which pile belongs to whom and would never take clay from someone else's pile. The potter collects from the pile big chunks of red clay that is of a good quality for making the pots. The chunks that have black in them are rejected. The clay is then transported back to the potter's shed in a bag on her head. Behind the shed is another "quarry"; white clay from the bottom layer of the pit is collected here. The mixing of the red and white clay with water makes it suitable for making pots. A large stone is wetted with 27. "C'est la fumée ou suye de cette gome, qui s' attaché au Canari qui fait ce beau noir" (Breton 1892:13). 28.

"Ils peignent ce vase de différentes couleurs, l'ornent de différentes figures et se ser- vent pour cette peinture du suc de certains arbres qui est comme un verni qui conserve ce fruit dans sa beauté et empêche que la chaleur ou l'humidité luy cause quelque altération ou le fasse fender" (Anonymous 1961:81).</page><page sequence="22">94 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT Figure 6. Different steps in the folk pottery manufacturing process. Clockwise from top left: collection of the clay, pounding the clay, shaping the vessel, drying in preparation for firing (Morne Sion, St. Lucia) some water and the mixed clay is put on top of the stone, forming a small pile. The potter splashes a little more water on the pile and then uses a long wooden tool, like a pestle, that is thin at the top and thick at the bottom, to pound the clay. She stops every few minutes to turn the clay and put it back on the pile. She works the clay with her hands, in between the pounding. The process takes about five to ten minutes. The pounded clay is then taken in to her workshop. To shape the clay the potter uses a clay bowl with rounded edges, and places it on her lap. She takes a handful of clay from a pile to her right, and begins to work the clay with her hands. She makes a long coil and begins to smooth it out, forming the base of the pot. Then the clay is flattened with her hands. She takes more clay from the pile and forms shorter lumps. These lumps are worked into the clay she has in her hands. She works the clay by turning the base and adding the lumps and forming the walls of the pot. The</page><page sequence="23">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 95 potter adds more lumps, turning and working the sides of the pot with the coils, going higher and higher. To scrape the clay on the inside and outside of the pot, the potter uses a calabash sherd or scale ( cau or kay; see couebi in Allaire 1976, 1977:64).30 She wipes the rim of the pot with a wet cloth. Then the pot is left to dry until the next day, because the clay is too soft to smooth. Sometimes, depending on the shape of the pot, a ceramic mold is used to form the base part. To decorate some of the pots, she makes finger-notched impres- sions on the rim. A polishing stone is used to polish the vessel's surface. The potter gathers these stones from the beach. She does not fire the pots that she has made until she can fire a large batch at once. So she waits until more pots are finished, before stacking them. Wood is placed on top of the pile to cover the pots. Then more pots and pieces of wood are piled on top of that up to a height of about 1.60 metres. More wood goes around the boundaries and up the sides of the pile, and it is lit until all the wood has burned (Figure 7). Figure 7. The firing place (Morne Sion, St. Lucia) SYNTHESIZING REMARKS: CHANGING CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS St. Lucia's fascinating history from late pre-Columbian through colonial to present times reflects the changing social and cultural environment in which the pottery manufacturing traditions must be studied. All three tra- 30. This word resembles the Island Carib word coy mentioned by the Anonymous of Carpentras. This word means "calabash" (see Moreau 1987:109).</page><page sequence="24">96 CORINNE L. HOFMAN &amp; ALISTAIR J. BRIGHT ditions include hand-built and low-fired pottery. While all the clays used seem to be of local origin, their composition is different. As far as shaping is concerned, coiling is considered the most common shaping technique used for the Suazoid pottery, albeit often combined with flattening, slab building, pinching, and molding. Although coiling is reported for today's pottery, fash- ioning with smaller lumps of clay is done by the potter in Morne Sion and has also been reported for Antigua (Allaire 1976). Molds are used in both cases. The chroniclers give no details for the Island Carib pottery regarding the shaping techniques. Calabash tools are used in all three cases to scrape to equalize and make the surface thinner. During the finishing process, Suazoid vessel surfaces are often scratched or scraped, but polished surfaces occur as well, whereas folk-pottery surfaces are exclusively smoothed and polished. Island Carib vessel surfaces are report- ed to be smudged with a black soot. Smudging also occurs among various Amerindian people on the mainland, notably those of the Guianas coastal zone and the Orinoco Valley. The resin used for smudging is the simiri (derived from the bark of the locust tree Hymenaea courbaril ), and it ensures a water- proof surface (Boomert 1995:27). Smudging is also known from earlier pre- Columbian pottery, often occurring on the inside of the vessel. The tools used to scrape and polish the vessels have remained the same. Decoration is rare but consists of finger-notched patterns on rims, com- mon to the late Suazoid ceramics on the Windward Islands and St. Lucia. It is not mentioned by the chroniclers, but is still applied occasionally today on folk pottery. On other islands, like Martinique, finger-notched rims are not a common feature on modern pottery (Victor 1941; Allaire 1977). The fine ware of the Suazoid series has incised, painted, and modeled designs, often on red slipped surfaces. The chroniclers do mention varnishes of grey, red, and yellow and of many other colors. Today's folk pottery is largely undecorated and does not bear any slip. Firing is done in an open fire on which the clay pots are piled up as was done in pre-Columbian and early colonial times. In general, simple vessel shapes characterize all three traditions. Interest- ingly, Suazoid vessels and bowls have flat bases and low ring bases, but legged bowls are present as well. The Island Carib canary is reported to have a pointed base. Flat bases are common in today's folk pottery. The griddle for baking cassava bread occurs throughout all three periods, although their shapes and sizes differ. During the Suazoid, griddles have three legs. The chroniclers mention griddles that rest on three stones similar to today's grid- dles. The dimensions of the latter are, however, far greater. Vessel nomenclature attests to their divergent origins. Close correspon- dence has been noted between the Island Carib names and the nomenclature used by the Karina of the Guyanas and the Middle Orinoco Valley (Allaire 1977:55-61, 1984). The chamacou is similar to the Karina samaku , and the Island Carib toura, balabi , and tomahiem to the Karina touroua, parapi, and</page><page sequence="25">POTTERY MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN ST. LUCIA 97 tuma-yene , respectively. On the other hand, the term canari , used by the chroniclers, is still in use today among St. Lucians. It has been suggested that the term is derived from the Spanish and is used in areas colonized by the French, while the English use the term conaree. The term boutéicha mentioned by the chroniclers is also derived from the Spanish. The term chaudière mentioned by Breton (1966:71) is also still in use on St. Lucia today as chòdyè in kwèyòl. Pottery manufacture was a household affair in these traditions. Women have been the principal potters through time. However, according to Biet (1896:39), the manufacture of pottery was a male activity among the Island Carib, who were related to the Karina of French Guiana, in the mid seven- teenth century. Apparently this changed to a female activity during the early eighteenth century (Boomert 1995:32). Boomert speculated that it might be possible that the Island Carib men, assuming that they moved to the islands, continued to manufacture a mainland-derived pottery repertoire motivated by the desire to express strong feelings of ethnic unity with the Karina of the mainland. According to Boomert (1995:32) the resulting contact may well explain why there are two pottery repertoires (one female related and one male related) among the Island Carib - a situation that is expressed in a distinct nomenclature for certain vessel types and their physical appearance. Today, although men may assist during some parts of the production process, pottery manufacturing remains a woman's affair. The island of St. Lucia is certainly one of the most interesting places in the Lesser Antilles to study the development of pottery traditions because one can clearly observe nearly two thousand years of pottery manufac- ture on this island. To this day there is a very strong survival of traditional craftsmanship on the island, not only of pottery manufacture, but also the making of fish pots, mats, baskets, and of cassava processing. These tra- ditional crafts are still very pertinent to contemporary society as is evident from the establishment of the Folk Research Centre in Castries, the capital of St. Lucia. This interest coincides with other developments such as the open- ing and maintaining of historical parks at Pigeon Island, Mamiku Garden, Balembouche Estate, and Fond d'Or. This heritage is not only significant in terms of tourist revenue, but equally, or more, so as the foundations of a national identity. This study hopes to have fulfilled the aim of illustrating the distinctive- ness of each pottery manufacturing tradition rooted in the divergent origins, whilst on the other hand acknowledging the resemblances resulting from a blend of traditions. Suazoid pottery represents an indigenous, pre-Columbian development of the Windward Islands. Island Carib pottery shows strong cultural affiliations with the mainland of South America, especially, but not exclusively, in the Karina earthenware of the Guyana coastal zone (Boomert 1995:27) also bears European influences, specifically in its nomenclature</page><page sequence="26">98 CORINNE L.
