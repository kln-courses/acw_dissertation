<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMOTION THE problem of abstract and programme music is ever with us. The fire sometimes only smoulders, but when a Strauss or a Stravinsky comes along, it blazes up at once. At the moment it is not giving off much heat, but only making sufficient smoke to fuddle the layman, who is assured by writers on music' that music is a unique mode of experience sui generis, but by composers2, who almost always give to their works a motto or descriptive title, that it is a common mode of experience though recorded in a peculiar medium. It is an interest- ing occupation to criticise the views put forward at various times about the real nature of music-Hanslick's arabesques in sound3, Newman's dualism4, and the " purely musical emotion " invoked by some psychologists and many musicians5. But what I wish here to do is to adduce a new argument for the old way of regarding music as the expression of emotion. Most of what has been written about the place of emotion in music was written before psychology had said anything useful about emotion. Indeed, a scientific psychology of emotion only began with William James6, and has not yet reached any certain conclusions, though the work of Ribot and McDougall is sufficient to enable us now to approach this ancient problem from a new angle. If we examine the territory that lies between Music and Psychology we may find an answer, so far as a philosophic problem ever does find an answer, to the aesthetic problem, which neither musicians nor philosophers have yet done very much to solve. Psychology presents a rather bedraggled appearance just now, having been pushed between the upper millstone of philosophic and scientific 1 Mr. W. J. Foxell, for example, in his new little book on " Musical Appreciation," which quite rightly recognises that this is a topic which belongs to Appreciation as much as a study of Form or History, adopts this view. He says: " Whatever intellectual or emotional associations we, or even the composer, may please to make with the music, it is not these, but the musical ideas themselves .... which are the real content of the music." 2 Even Vaughan Williams, for example, who has recently proclaimed his allegiance to the Ascetics in no uncertain tones. 3 See " The Beautiful in Music " (Hanslick). 4 See the article "' Programme Music " in Musical Studies. 5 Among psychologists, Dr. W. Brown; among musicians, who usually use the term emotion unscientifically for sensation, Mr. Arthur flliss and Mr, Edwin Evans are representative names. 6 "Principles of Psychology." (Macmillan, 1890.)</page><page sequence="2">46 MUSIC AND LETTERS contempt and the lower of superstitious veneration. But, if it has anything to say about music, we can at any rate listen sceptically. What is emotion, and how does it get into music? I propose to adopt McDougall's view of the nature of emotion and to develop the thesis that all the music which one wants to hear is programme music; that the programme is mainly emotional, that the emotions which are " expressed in " or " are the subject matter " of music are the ordinary emotions of life, and not peculiar to music or purely musical emotions; that this emotional content is the subject of that pure in- tuition which Croce has described as the essence of artistic creation; and that every work of art (and therefore all music) is a judgment of value, in which the intellectual element is represented by the word " judgment " and the emotional by the word value, emotion being the source of our values. A judgment of value, then, casts a feeling into the form of a judgment, which is a logical proposition involving and addressed to the intellect. When we say "This is good," we communicate in that short proposition a fact and an emotion. The communication is intellectual: the emotion com- municated, though recognisably distinct, is inseparable from the intellectual judgment. The psychosis is indivisible. Similarly what happens in Art is that some experience of an emotional character, which from the nature of the case is fleeting, has somehow been caught up and crystallised by the intellect in the same kind of way as the particular facts apprehended by the intellect are caught up and crystallised in concepts. This crystallised emotion is the work of art. On the face of it Wordsworth's famous definition of art as " emotion recollected in tranquility " seems inadequate, but it does embody this central idea that an evanescent experience has somehow been caught and given a permanent form. We are all familiar with emotional states by our own direct experi- ence of them, and psychologists tried for long enough to make out an exhaustive list of the various emotions, each of which has a peculiar quality. But the lists when they had got them led nowhere, and only resulted in confusion, for our emotional life does not appear to introspection as a succession of this, that, and the other, but as a continually changing stream in which one element comes into prominence and then fades into something else; fear to curiosity, curiosity to annoyance or anger, anger to disgust and so on. McDougall has, therefore, put forward a hypothesis about the general nature of emotion, which systematises the emotions and brings them into relation with the other phenomena of mind, and yet allows for the distinctive qualities of the different emotions recognised by common speech and literature. This hypothesis does not yet command</page><page sequence="3">EMOTION 47 universal assent among psychologists, but it is finding increasing sup- port and in the absence of any equally comprehensive account may safely be accepted as the starting point for any enquiry that involves the study of the emotions. The hypothesis is that emotion is the central part of all instinctive mental processes. The complete mental process consists of first becoming aware of a stimulating object, and finally acting somehow towards it in a way innately determined. Between the cognitive and conative activities is a central part, the affective. The cognitive and conative activities admit of very great modifications, not only in individuals, but between one man and another, but the affective part is common to all men and remains uncontrollable and unchanging in the individual. Fear, for example, causes different men to act differently, and men are made afraid by the perception of different objects, and the same individual may be frightened by different objects at different stages of his career; but the central thing, the feeling of fear, is everywhere and always the same in quality.' Every instinct has a central part, which may be called its accompanying emotion, with a peculiar quality of its own. These are the primary emotions, and McDougall has sifted out of the vast range of our emotional experience those which seem to be irreducible to anything else or to one another, and tabulates the primary2 emotions and the instincts from which they are derived in parallel columns thus: 1. Instinct. Emotion accompanying the Instinc- tive Activity. 1. Escape (self-preservation, avoid- 1. Fear (terror, fright, alarm, etc.). ance, danger instinct). 2. Combat (aggression, pugnacity). 2. Anger (rage, irritation, dis- pleasure). 3. Repulsion. 3. Disgust (repugnance). 4. Parental (protective). 4. Tender emotion (love). 5. Appeal. 5. Distress. 6. Pairing (reproduction, sexual). 6. Lust (sexual emotion or excite- ment-sometimes called love-- an unfortunate and confusing usage). 1 This cannot, of course, be proved, and is only an inference from experi- ence, but there seems no reason to doubt it. Even Siegfried ultimately knew what fear was; the cognitive part of the instinct was not stimulated by the perception of Fafnir in his case, as it would have been in that of most of us, nor was the resulting conation the same in him as it would have been in me (I should never have stood up to the dragon like that), and, again, many of us could have gazed upon Brunhilde, if not without emotion, yet without the emotion of fear; yet there seems to be no doubt that the central affective part of his experience was fear, the common human emotion we all know sooner or later. So that McDougall's doctrine holds even in the somewhat abnormal case of Siegfried. 2 Tn "S Social Psychology " he gives two criteria for the primacy of an emotion: (1) if a similar emotion is found among the higher animals; (2) if it is found morbidly exaggerated in pathological cases.</page><page sequence="4">48 MUSIC AND LETTERS 1.

Amusement (jollity, relaxation).1 But the complexity of the experience of the civilised adult is such that he rarely experiences any of these crude emotions in a pure form; far more frequently two or more emotions are aroused simultaneously and blend to form secondary and tertiary emotions. As an example of a binary compound he gives scorn, which is the mixture of disgust and anger. Add positive self-feeling to scorn and we get contempt. In a similar way he accounts for admiration as the mixture of wonder and submission, for awe as admiration plus fear (" admiration is a binary, awe a tertiary compound "). Add gratitude to awe and we get reverence. Gratitude in itself a compound of tender emotion and negative self-feeling (submission). Fear plus disgust is loathing; add wonder and we get fascination. This account of the origin and nature of emotion as we experience it in ordinary life is but a rough summary: it is necessary to add that these primary and derived emotions are blended with one another and modified in a hundred ways.2 They are, however, but the raw material of our emotional life, which would be at the level of the animals if we felt and behaved according as the fleeting stimulus of the moment aroused first one and then another of these instincetive emotions and their derivatives. The minid of civilised man is more highly organised than this, for the evanescence of emotioln is one of 4a mnat notewworthv eharacteristies.3 While any feeling of fear, anger 1 This list, which I quote from his most recent work (" Outline of Psychology," p. 324) is not quite the same as the list he gives in " Social Psychology." It is not necessary to the acceptability of his general theory that every emotion ever experienced by man should at this stage of our knowledge be assigned once and for all to a definite place in this or any other list, or in some doubtful eases be rigidly classed with theo primary or with the derived emotions. 2 The reader is referred to his " Social Psychology " for an indication of some of these modifications. See especially pp. 128 et seq. 3 Cf. Ribot. "It is a phenomenon of sudden appearance and limitedl duration." It might be well to quote the rest of his definition: " Emotion is in the order of feeling the equivalenit of perception in the intellectual order, a complex synthetic state essentially made up of produced or arrested movements. (Cf. below p. 53), of organic modificationis (in circulation, respiration, etc.), of an agreeable or painful or mixed state of consciousness peculiar to eaeh emotion."</page><page sequence="5">EMOTION 49 or more subtly compounded emotion is at once the chief motive of action and the standard of value by which all behaviouir, both of the suibject himself and of others, is judged while it lasts, its duration is limited. One may blaze with anger for five minutes, remain in a state of bad temper for an hour after an outburst, hut a day wears away all but a thin substratum of the most intense emotion.1 It will, however, be objected that some motives of instinctive or emotional origin sometimes dominate conduct for years or even a life- time-stories of revenge offer more striking examples of what happens in the experience of everyone. This kind of emotional permanence is explained by the doctrine of the " sentiments,"2 according to which our emotions tend to organise themselves about the various objects which tend to exicte them. The word " complex " is sometimes applied to these systems of associated mental elements, which are bound together by emotional ties. Psychologists have not yet made uip their minds whether the term " complex " should be restricted to pathological " sentiments,' '3 but the fact is now universally recog- nised, and can be verified by anyone who observes at all carefully the behaviour of his fellow men, that the mind does organise its experi- ences into systems which are unified by common affect (feeling) in suich a way that if one of the elements is stimulated the whole system is called into activity. A musical example will make this clear. By the war a very strong German complex, in which many of the strongest primary emotions, fear, anger, aggression, gregariousness, provided the affective bonds, was organised in the minds of most Englishmen, with the result that many musical people, who could not deny the greatness of Beethoven and Wagner, said quite openly that, while they did not wish to say anything against the quality of the music, they did not want to hear it just now; in the case 'of Strauss they went fuirther, and not only would not listen to him, but saw in the fact of his writing for an orchestra of some size the megalomania of the Kaiser; while purists, who previously condemned the use of any song ;rsnshtiAns (~could no Ionger bear to hear their Schubert and Brahms 1 In this crude analysis I have omitted, the intermediate mental processes wthich depend on circumstances, whether, e.g., in the case of anger the emotion is vented on the offender, in which case the transient character of the emotion is even more apparent; or, whether, in cases where no conation is immediately involved, the crude emotion brings into operation a sentiment like justice, which ultimately satisfies the instinct in the indirect form of punishment. The point is that not only is our whole; emotional life varying from moment to moment, but any particular emotion which may be dominant for an appreciable time varies in intensity and in no short time is replaced by another. 2 Enunciated by Ribot (" Psychologie des Sentiments ") and elaborated by Shand (" Foundations of Character "), and McDougall (" Social Psychology "). 3 They held a symposium about it only last winter (1922-3). Vol. .</page><page sequence="6">50 MUSIC AND LETTERRS in German. Any German association tended to rouse the whole complex into activities with its accompanying emotion of strong repugnance. It is from " sentiments " or " complexes" of this kind, though they are not always so highly charged with strong affect, that most of the emotions of ordinarv experience are derived. Some- times an instinct may be aroused pure and its corresponding pure emotion experienced, but much more frequently our feelings are blends of several instinctive emotions or derived from sentiments. In any case, the ultimate source of any emotion muBt always be sought among the instincts. It is the difficulty of finding adequate origins in instinct that compels us to reject the hypothesis of a purely musical emotion. For either we have to postulate a purely musical instinct, or to show that we have a music sentiment capable of yielding the rich emotional content revealed in the works of composers and experienced by the listener. The objections to postulating a primary instinct for music are numerous, independently of the biological objections. First, there is the wide recognition already noticed that whatever the nature of musical satisfaction may be, it is the same in essence as that derived from the other arts. If we postulate an instinct for art we shall be driven to do the same for religion, scientific enquiirv and consciencel -which seems to be untidy and uneconomical thinking. Further, as we shall see, there are elements of several other instincts embedded in osthetic experience, so that it cannot be one of the primary in- stincts. Then, again, the emotion vielded by a primary instiniet is a single feeliing of peculiar qualitv (ef. Ribot's definlition), and it would be difficult to regard the content of a ftneral march and a scherzo as producing the same single, peculiar effect on the listener. If we admit a whole series of emotions peculiar to music (as Dr. Brown2), we have but added to our difficulties, for we can give nio account of them or of their origin. The most hopeful source of a purely musical emotion is the sense of rhythm. " Sense " of rhythm we say, but it has some claims to be called an instinct. Rhythm is undoubtedly innate. and not only an innate faculty. (i.e., akin to other forms of appre- hension), but possessing considerable dynamic powers, which bring it very nearlv into the r ealm of emotion (Wundt, indeed, calls it an emotion). A rhythmic movement, like drumming with one's heels, oanmQ to nrodnea a nurely rhythmic pleasure of an emotional character, 1 Dean Rashdall and Prof. MclDougal recently carried on a considerable controversy in the " Hibbert Journal " on a point closely akin to this. 2 " The Quest," 1912, where he states (but does not argue) that " Music expresses an emotional life peculiar to itself. Thet emotions represented are not the emotions of everyday life, nor are they even idealised forms of these emotions."</page><page sequence="7">EMOTION 51 but it- may also produce a whole series of ordinary emotions ranging from stupor to frenzy. In any case, whether it be an emotion or a sense-the sense by which we apprel-end time-and however lorae a part it plays in musical. satisfaction1, we are hardly entitled to explain the emotional significance solely in terms of rhythm and take no account of the great powers of emotional expression possessed by other elements in music, melody, harmony, design and tone-colour. The whole is greater than the part. But if we have no a?sthetic instinct it is certain that we have an tsthetic sentiment. M. Ribot in Ch. x. of his classic work on the emotions expresses the origin and traces the evolution of our Festhetic 1 Not long ago I heard the Hungarian String Quartet play Mozart's D minor quartet, in which the trio of the Minuet contains this passage: : t At the asterisk they mnade a hardly appreciable pause, the very smallest possible hold-up of the rhythm. The effect was electrifying, and woke me from a semi-bored stupor to which a. previous quartet had reduced me, to a most intense feeling of pleasure an-d awakeness, and I rem-ember that I start-ed up in my chair. This experience had all the marks of emotion and fitted Ribot's definition in every respect including an organic disturbance in the region of the spine, the motor discharge involved in my sudden change of position and the unique pleasurable feeling-tone. In asking myself Su'b- sequently what' this emotion was, I could find for it nothing but a purely rhythmic content. But I do not wholeheartedly accept even a purely rhythmic emotion. I hesitate to appeal to symbolism, by arguing that the rhythmic emotion is a symbol of some other e-motion. I do, however, regard this as the most serious objection to my view of the nature of art' (as the expression of ordinary emotion). It might be possible to meet it by putting forward a htypothesis of "undifferentiated emotion "corresponding to " free libido " which appears to introspection merely as "excitement." But I do not X know.</page><page sequence="8">52 MUSIC AND LETTERS sentiment. He accepts the true origin of art as lying in the play impulse, and is emphatic that there is a purely instinctive element. i This x," he writes, speaking of the proprium quid of creative work, " which for want of a better term we may call spontaneity, is of the nature of an instinct. It is a craving to create, equivalent in the intellectual order to the generative craving in the physiological order." And from this germ he traces the evolution of the sentiment through dancing, which is muscular play, and ornament, which has a social val-ue, to the anthropomorphic stage where art is freed from a merely human reference and man is enabled to derive aesthetic pleasure from the natural beauty of scenery (a late development for which there seems to have been no taste even in classical times), till finally he can talk of " Art for Art's sake." Some such analysis must be accepted of the origin of the pleasure which we derive from the contemnplation of beauty (whether of Nature, art or anything else). This particular enmotion is present in anv artistic activity. A singer or conductor, for example, if asked to register the emotional content of his conscioutsness at the actual moment of performing a work will be most aware of at sense of power or ilpotence in. " getting it over," whether he has got his audience, whether he is getting this nuiance from his instrument and so on; in fact, the dominant emotion is that derived from the instinct of construction and is identical in kind with that of a potter shaping his vessel, of a schoolboy solving an algebraical problem, of a chemist at the critical moment of his experiment, or of anyone engaged in anything which is " coming right " or " going wrong." But this emotion is plainly not that which inspired the composer to write, though it will dominate his mind perhaps during the labour-pains of composition, and it is certainly not what the listener feels. It is neither a purely musical emotion nor is it the emotional content of a work of art. The emotions of the listener give one a valuable clue, for though he feels foreboding at Zamiel's syncopated drum-taps in Der Frieschutz, heavenly rapture in the last movement of the Ninth Symphony, and stark terror in Holst's Mars, yet it is not quite the same foreboding that he experiences at receiving a summons to a fateful interview or the terror of actual warfare. Something happens to the emotion which makes it different, though leaving it the same emotion. This something is Wordsworth's " remembering in tranquility." It is the essence of art, like the essential meaning of a thing crystallised in a concept. The emotion is caught up by an act of intuition. The difficulty of this view for music is the indefiniteness of the emotion as seen by introspection and the great variation in the emotion produced in or suggested to different minds. The Andante</page><page sequence="9">EMOTION 53 of a string quartet may suggest to one the tranquility of the sea at Margate on a summer morning, to another the tranquility of religious resignation, to a third the quiet satisfaction of a piece of work well done; while the composer, if pressed for the impulse which begot the work, may say that it was some charming idyll which he read in a book of short stories. This very serious difficulty is robbed of its worst terrors by Ribot's doctrine of emotional memory and by a consideration, universally recognised, of the complexity and variation in human character. Let us see how all this works. It is to deliver myself into the hands of the enemy and to commit the unforgivable sin. But for argument's sake let me take a musical example and imagine a not impossible (I hope) programme for it. Brahms towards the end of his life wrote ., Uf. ,' IA I -I Taking this movement in connection with what we know, both from his music and his biography, of his life, thought, tastes and character, we may interpret it as an expression of that passionate longing, which for some natures is specially apt to arise at the contemplation of great natural beauty, to seize upon life, to stop the flow of time,' and with a side-glance at Death to eternalise the transient. There is no one name for a complex emotion of this kind, and its quality is so subtle as to be inexpressible save in music-words will not do it.2 Possibly not every human being will feel the mingled wistfulness and gratitude of it, and those who do feel it will feel the mingled emotional elements in different degrees. of strength according to their intellectual faith, their emotional sensitiveness, even their physical sensitiveness to sun and air, in a word, according to their personality. Hence it comes about that any two violinists playing this work may take this theme I This element is present, I think, in some degree in all big art, but in this work it is very strong. 2 But it can be analysed, anid its instinctive origins indicated. First, the great natural instinct of preservation of the self, combined with, strange as it may seem, negative self-feeling, then some root of gratitude to tlhe Creator in which tenider emotion- and negative self-feeling are blended, to these miist be added an elemienit of wonder and, perhaps, a small amount of joy andl sad- ness, both complex emotional states. The bracing element whiclh becomes more prominent in the second subject is derived from the self-regarding sentiment.</page><page sequence="10">54 MUSIC AND LETTERS a shade faster or slower, and while they can hardly fail to feel its wistfulness, may interpret it in a different sense from that given by two other violinists. And it also comes about that while we can all write strings of thirds and sixths, they won't be what Brahms wrote because we are not Brahms and have not the precise blend of intel- lectual, emotional, moral and all the other traits that Brahms had. Further, a similar emotional stimulus would react differently on Bach or Mozart or Holst.1 These are commonplaces admitted widely enough, but not always realised at their full value. They would certainly be difficult to maintain and account for on Hanslick's theory of " arabesques sonores." It seems safe to assume that all humans are equipped with the same instincts from which emotion is ultimately derived, and that we canl all experience all the emotions-Mr. Holst says that musicians are expressing in sound what all men feel; and yet within this funda- mental sameness there is the enormous divergence which we have just noted. When we come to the divergence of interpretation given by those who listen to the Clarinet Quintet or to our imaginary tranquil Andante, how shall we reconcile the summer morning at Margate with religious resignation? By M. Ribot's theory of emotional memory; which claims that emotional states divested of all their accompanying circumstances can leave behind them a memory of themselves. Alongside of ordinary intellectual memory is this affective memory in which the feeling of love, fear or disappointment is separated from its causes on the various occasions on which it was experienced, and is in a sense an abstract emotion, analogous to an abstract idea (or concept). Now the motion of music arouses general or abstract emotional states (an abstract of tranquility in our example) and through them by means of association and a kind of emotional reverberation, calls up in each hearer his own particular images and ideas which have once formed the settings of such emotional states in each individual's experience.2 Confirmation is found for this doctrine in the close connection between emotion 1 I had a very good illustration of this at an orchestral concert at which Dvorak's violin concerto and Mozart's horn concerto were played on the same evening. The last movements of both works seemed to me to express the same feeling of light-hearted gaiety. The sameness was easily recognisable though it passed through the medium of the personality of -a passionate Czech on the one hand, and of a mercurial Viennese on the other. 2 M. Combarieu's criticism of this doctrine in " La Musique, ses Lois, son Evolution " is directed not against its explanation of differing interpreta- tions, but against the view that the subject-matter of music is these abstract emotions. My view is that the composer is expressing a definite emotional state which may, it is true, have more than one root in his total past experi- ence, and so far be a generalised emotion, but which is essentially a pro- gramme felt at a definite moment.</page><page sequence="11">EMOTION 55 and bodily movement and the movement of music. Thus M. Combarieu, who rejects the idea that musical composition is emotional memory, claims for his own doctrinel what he calls " le dynamisme de la vie passionelle." " Directement, la musique ne peut traduire aucun sentiment determine," he says [which is pre- cisely what I argue it does do]; "mais, de la vie psychique elle traduit l'intensit6, le dynamisme interieur et general avec tous ses degres . . . . elle neglige les representations et les concepts qui accompagnent l'etat affectif; elle n'en retient que l'energie..... Elle est pour ainsi dire le dynamometre le la vie sentimentale." The same idea appears in H. J. Watt's " Foundations of Music." " Melody," he says, " is the motional connection between tones, and with all its means of variation (rhythm, speed, pitch, etc.) it is only necessary to bring the motions of music into some sort of correspondence with the character of the acts and energies of man for it to be able to express his soul's life." Music is a form of motion, now-spatial but temporal. On the other side the connection of emotional states with bodily movements has been emerging more and more clearly in psychology. James's topsy-turvy doctrine of the emotions is only an overstatement of the accepted view that it is incipient conation. The two words " motion" and " emotion " significantly have a number of their letters in common. No one can deny motion to music, though he may wish to keep it free from e-motion. Motion will thus express the ebb and flow of psychic energy; an emotional state of whatever sort-whether, as Ribot says, it be the feelings that arise from neuralgia or the grief expressed by Michael Angelo in his Sonnets-reduces itself to a heightening or depression of the energy of the organism. The motions of music will then express the composer's emotions and awaken those of his audience, and just as every individual listener has a different idea of the concept " dog " according to his individual experience of particular dogs, so will his emotion of tranquility be different according to the different circumstances (at Margate or in a cathedral) in which he has experienced tranquility and to the individual make-up of his own character. An objection which a doctrine such as the one here put forward has to meet is the phenomenon of the prodigy, which has occurred so frequently in the history of music. If character and emotional experience are the vital essence of music, how can the music of a very young man, a Mozart or a Mendelssohn or a Schubert, have the 1 " La musique est l'art de penser avec des sons sans concepts."</page><page sequence="12">56 MUSIC AND LETTERS worth which a great deal of this " young" work undeniably has? It is hard to give a complete answer, but two things may be borne in mind. First, instinct is a natural endowment and may develop young, so that the chief ingredient, emotional susceptibility, is given, just as exceptional iintellectual ability is a gift of Nature and may put forth its powers early; any theory, except perhaps Hanslick's formalism, must take so much for granted. Second, though it is easy to make a list of youthful geniuses who have given birth to full-grown works of art, an equally if not more imposing list may be made of composers who, like Beethoven and Wagner, have only produced their greatest work in maturity after deep experience of life. We shall never explain why some men are more gifted than others, nor why one man's gift runs to making those flying leaps which we call creation in the field of chemistry and another's in the field of periodic sound vibrations. But that need not discourage us from examining the fruits of the gift, nor invalidate its analysis. Let us look the difficulty boldly in the face and pass by. Emotion, then, is the impulse which sets the creative instinct at work and is the subject-matter of the communication that the creator gives to the world. In the process of giving it he crystallises it, putting into permanent form something that as it occurs is of brief duration. How does he do it? What is the nature of the crystallising process? Modern opinion in the main follows Croce in declaring it to be an act of intuition, i.e., it is a process of cognition and the work of the intellect. Lascelles Abercrombie pursues the implications of this and says that beauty is not a quality of things but an intuition or judgment passed oln experience, and the work of art is the expression of the complete experience, which includes the value it has for the mind wlhich experiences it.' He further holds, as Croce does not, that an essential attribute of art is that it is communication or publication to others of a complete experience (" complete " again=" complete with values "), and for purposes of communication the expression mulst be external; and since an intuition, if it is to be communicated, must take the formn of a judgment, we are jtustified in saying that the intuition of art is a judgment of value. Art is not concerned with 1 Essay towards a " Theory of Art," p. 50: " When we say that art con- sists of the expression of experience we mean the expression of whole experi- ence: both of the substance which the world contributes by being experienced and simultaneously of the value which the mind contributes." The reader is referred to the earlier chapters of this work on " aesthetic experience," which is the raw material of art, becaus3 Abercrombie might deny that this was the same thing as the emotional experience for which I argue. " Face value " is his test for mesthetic experience. But must not even " face value" satisfy some instinct?</page><page sequence="13">EMOTION 57 facts or statements and can make no existential judgments; its subject-matter is value, and experience only has value in so far as it appeals to and satisfies our emotions. For the emotions, rooted though they are in instinct, are the finest flower of human evolution without which reason itself is barren and may be evil. And it is the highest in man with which the masterpieces of music deal. F. S. HowEs.</page></plain_text>
