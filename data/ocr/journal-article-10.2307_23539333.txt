<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gerry H. Brookes Fictional Forms in William Hale White's Autobiography of Mark Rutherford and Mark Rutherford's Deliverance For Victorian scholars William Hale White's Autobiography of Mark Rutherford (1881) and Mark Rutherford's Deliverance (1885) raise the question of how literary criticism should deal with works that seem a mix of fictional and autobiographical materials. They may be treated as mixed works, but doing so avoids a leading question in genre theory, whether there is an informing principle, fictional or autobiographical, to which the various elements may be subordinated. I mean to argue that in the Autobiography the fictional and any auto biographical elements are subordinated to the dramatic representation of an egotistical character in a particular predicament that is worked out according to the principles of plot. Although Deliverance takes up again the narrative of the life of the same character, White shifts his focus onto communal principles of adaptation to modern life, which he exemplifies in various lives, giving his work an exemplary shape, that of an apologue. Both works have forms that approximate those of narrative fiction, and they should be judged accordingly.1 Although some critics have been content to consider the works amorphous fictionalized autobiography, interpretation from the start has been dominated by the hypothesis that the works have the coher ence and power of autobiography, that is, that their effect depends on their representing experience that is prior to the text, which is what I seek to deny. In reviewing both books, William Dean Howells remarked, "When you have read the books you feel that you have wit nessed the career of a man as you might have witnessed it in the world and not in a book. We could not give too strong an impression of this</page><page sequence="2">248 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 incomparable sincerity" (485). White himself encouraged the ten dency to read the works as autobiographical. Referring to the Autobiog raphy and Deliverance in The Early Life of Mark Rutherford (W. Hale White)—a title that indicates his public identification with his protago nist2—White remarked, "I have been asked at 78 years old to set down what I remember of my early life. A good deal of it has been told before under a semi-transparent disguise, with much added which is entirely fictitious" (5).3 While his remarks encourage viewing the works as at least mixed in genre, they do not provide an indication of the principles according to which he uses both fictional and autobio graphical materials. His claim that much of the narrative is fictional has not been sufficient to discourage critics from viewing it as essen tially self-expressive, in part because no fictional form seems evident to them.4 On the other hand, the works are clearly not pure autobiog raphy. Originally, in responding to Howells, even White himself seemed momentarily convinced that he had not invented any of the narrative but had simply recorded it. He wrote Howells that he "never should have dreamed of publishing anything if it had not struck me when I was fifty that perhaps some of my experiences were worth recording for the sake of those who were brought up as I was" (Stone 124). This justification for publishing is, of course, very close to that claimed by his protagonist in the opening pages of the Autobiography (Ch. 1: p. 2). White apparently could not bring himself to admit that the impression of sincerity could be a creation of his art and was not simply implicit in a bare account of his own life. White seems to have been willing to risk confusion about the extent to which the works were records of verifiable experiences. The autobiographical impres sion that the works created, a strain of expressive criticism ready to embrace such an impression, and White's cooperation in allowing himself and his protagonist to be confused have all made it difficult to escape seeing the works as autobiography. James Anthony Froude, whose The Nemesis of Faith suffered from similar confusion in readers' minds, added a note to his text insisting that his protagonist's experi ence was not his own (xv-xvi).5 White never wrote such a note. This view, that White wrote only autobiography, rests on much that cannot be verified, often on an apparent intuition that some higher truth about the author is being told, rather than any literal one.6 An obvious reason for thinking that no literal truth is being told is that Rutherford's and White's lives do not conform in many details. Impor tant influences on White, such as his father and Caleb Morris, for example, are not present, and the significant episode in Deliverance of</page><page sequence="3">Brookes action and apologue 249 opening a room for the working poor of Drury Lane has no analogue in White's life. Any intrusion of White's father, for example, who re cited Byron from memory and was drawn away from the meeting house by Carlyle's early works, would have forced White to change significantly the course of Mark Rutherford's life. Catherine Mac donald Maclean has even suggested that the life story actually pre sented resembles those of two of White's friends, William Chignell and William Macall, more closely than his own (227). The discrepan cies between White's life and his protagonist's seem to suggest that he is turning his materials away from whatever meaning might be inher ent in the story of his own life and toward something else. Yet these fic tionalized details commonly drive the critics back into a more ineffable realm of essential truths, unknown facts, and psychological mysteries. Wilfred Stone, for example, who knows White's life more intimately than anyone, insists that all explanations of the details in the works must be biographical: the Drury Lane episode, for example, cannot be imaginary but must be based on some experience that White had but we cannot document (Stone 138). Obviously, any work in some mea sure arises from its author's experience. The real question is what is the form that "formulates" his experience. In his influential essay on White, Basil Willey warns that Mark Rutherford is not White, only "a projection from White's personality" (190). But in documenting the progress of his thought, Willey cannot help seeing these books as allegories of White's experience. Asking whether in the Autobiography, "he was not dramatizing a typical expe rience rather than recounting his own," Willey concludes that "Hale White's habit is to stick closely to the inner facts, however he may alter the outward details of his own life" (213). The critical question is not, however, whether White is presenting a typical experience or his own. The life he presents is both typical and unique, and much of its uniqueness springs from "outward details"—why are they not "out ward facts" in Willey's formulation?—that are different from those of White's life. Further, the distinction between inner and outer is not helpful, since the internal facts of Rutherford's life are, as we shall see, densely intertwined with the external. Whether human experience is dualistic (say, inner and outer) or holistic is an issue for White and a dilemma for Rutherford. The elements of experience, however, which might form a unity but often in White's eyes do not—that is, personal ity, physical well-being, ideas, community, circumstances—correspond to the elements of dramatic narrative. In such a narrative they can be manipulated experimentally and imaginatively, free from the ground</page><page sequence="4">250 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 of actual experience, free from the distinction between inner and outer reality, which forms the basis of Willey's claim for biographical authenticity. The distinction between telling one's own life story and telling a typical one is not useful. If White told his own, it would perforce have to be both typical and unique for anyone to be interested. White him self believed that there are common or typical threads running through lives, but that the condition of each life varies, often in frustrating, iso lating ways. Bunyan, whom White describes more than twenty years later, is like Rutherford but still unlike him. His Grace Abounding is "a terrible story of a peculiarly nervous and almost hypochondriacal tem perament; whose sufferings, although they are inter-twisted with Puri tanism, have roots which lie deep in our common nature. Bunyan's object in writing it was not the pleasure of self-analysis, but to strengthen those of his friends who had suffered his temptations" {Bunyan 8). Like many of his own critics, White was interested in the lives of which literary works were the expression. He viewed Byron, for example, as "a mass of living energy, and it is this which makes him so perpetually attractive and sanative [healing] too. For energy, power, is the one thing after which we pine, especially in a sickly age. . . . The real man, Byron, and his poems are perfectly unconscious, as unconscious as the wind" ("Byron" 184-85). Truths lie in the experi ence out of which men speak. But men and experiences differ. Ruther ford, of course, is not given the genius of Bunyan or the power of Byron, although he shares Puritan-like suffering with one and a "sickly age" with the other. White portrays Rutherford's life as both representative and particular, making him like other sensitive suf ferers, the distant type of whom he takes to be Christ, but making his suffering more "commonplace" (Autob. 1:1). The conditions under which he endures makes any consolation his life might offer much less certain than what Bunyan's affords. In short Rutherford's life is repre sentative but unique, worked out in particular circumstances that gov ern its shape and implications. If Rutherford's life is significantly different from White's, he clearly uses autobiographical materials and presents ideas and observations of his own, which appear elsewhere in his journals and other works. But the fictional and autobiographical materials are shaped within forms that make them intelligible, satisfying, and important, apart from the complex, extra-literary context of White's life. Both the Autobiography and Deliverance can be understood without a sense that some external truths or facts about the author are at issue or have the power to con</page><page sequence="5">Brookes ACTION AND APOLOGUE 251 firm or deny the substance of the narratives, as is certainly the case with overt autobiographies like Newman's Apologia or Mill's Autobiog raphy. Rather than telling his own story, White fuses fictional and autobiographical materials into a dramatic account of the life of a hypothetical person in the Autobiography and then, in Deliverance, into a set of hypothetical examples of how some people adapt to the disa bling conditions of modern life. Stone remarks that whenever White used personal experience in the Autobiography, he distorted it in order to make Rutherford's situation worse than his own had been (Stone 89). Indeed, some of his former schoolmates objected to his apparent unfairness to the president of the college he attended, a version of whom oppresses Rutherford (Stone 36). These distortions are neces sary to the consistent effect White wishes to create. Ultimately the books are powerful evidence of the nature of White's view of the world, but they are only indirect evidence of his personal experience. A number of framing devices, like the use of a fictional author and editor, point to the hypothetical nature of the narratives, inclining one to think that the experiences described are not necessarily true or are at least intended to seem more hypothetical than actual. The devices cer tainly work to forestall the reader's inclination to test the narratives against other accounts of the same life. The reader asks whether the text presents a plausible and internally consistent life story, not whether it presents a plausible version of the life of an actual person who may be inquired after. Yet a much more powerful indication of the nature of the narratives resides in the familiar informing shapes of fic tion, in the principles governing the forms of the works. One need not be surprised to discover from external sources that, as in much fiction, some episodes are versions of real events, but their power resides fully in the context of these works, where it lies in their probability, not in their verifiability or their accuracy as records of William Hale White's experience. Tacitly, one perceives that a whole, actual life could not arrange itself so neatly to fit the demands of the implicit forms, and it is hard to conceive of any reader, with vision unclouded by biography or romantic bias, becoming persuaded that these books are true and accurate accounts of the life of a real man. The formal principles in question, however, are framed within the conventions of autobiography. In the Autobiography, White has Ruth erford narrate in chronological order his life story from childhood, through his efforts at the ministry, to his work for a radical publisher in London. Deliverance continues this story to Rutherford's death but treats the conventions of autobiography more loosely. Since the two</page><page sequence="6">252 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 works are different, it will be best to concentrate on the Autobiography first. The frame of the Autobiography has a somewhat chaotic appear ance, which makes the work's form more difficult to perceive. White said that he wrote the Autobiography at "extraordinary high pressure" (D. White, Diary 51), haste that shows in long paragraphs that cover a range of subjects and in abrupt transitions, both of which make the work seem at times organized by the order of thought, by little more than recollection and association. The occasionally haphazard appear ance of the narrative makes it seem more spontaneously confessional of course, and the off-handed advice on curing alcoholism or dealing with passion in boys, for example, makes the work seem casually discursive. Yet its form is not casual. The work gains its considerable power through patterns that emerge in the episodes of Rutherford's life, pre cisely the kind of patterns that appear in plotted fiction, that is, in imi tations of actions, in imitations that involve the reader in inferring the nature of justice and degree of charity accorded the protagonist as a consequence of the interworkings of his character, thoughts, actions, and circumstances within the events that constitute this portion of his life. The work has the sort of dramatic organization that Aristotle describes in the Poetics, though it is, of course, not a play but a narra tive.7 Rather than observing the working out of human relationships as on a stage, we read the protagonist's account of them, and his attitude in the telling is part of the drama. This life story involves us not only in understanding but also in creating and satisfying expectations that do not derive from any effort at an accurate representation of some thing prior to and separate from the narrative itself.8 Expectations are raised by the pattern of events that emerges within a sequence of causally related episodes. The sequence may seem puz zling because while the episodes spring from each other in an intelligi ble way, they are not so closely linked that they give a very specific sense of inevitable progress along a line toward resolution. White does not go so far toward disrupting ordinary sequences of causes as does Hardy in his late novels, but he creates a similar sense that frustrating events like these were going to happen no matter what the specific causes. His ability to do so depends on his establishing that a wide range of causes can affect the protagonist. Rutherford may be thwarted or thwart himself in numerous ways. White focuses our generalized concern about causes and effects on specific elements of Rutherford's predicament, on his search for a place in the world, for companion ship, and for some stabilizing of his speculation. These quite human objectives are interrelated and bear directly on another concern, his</page><page sequence="7">Brookes action and apologue 253 health and happiness. Rutherford is vulnerable in any and all of these spheres, which, of course, complicates any progess he might make. Those scholars who have used these books to illuminate an actual, historical crisis of faith (and whose interest in the authenticity of the narrative is thereby enhanced) have emphasized Rutherford's ideas, but it should be noted that his predicament is a complex human one and only partly philosophical, a predicament both particular and rep resentative, one that involves a characteristically uncertain Victorian idealism. His personal predicament is the result of being brought up in a Dissenting community unable to prepare him to cope with the cur rent doubts about "the old anthropomorphic and miraculous religion" that Matthew Arnold remarked in 1877 "no longer reaches and rules" the popular mind "as it once did" (149). The problem is deepened by Rutherford's unsteady personality, his own and partly unique sense of isolaton and alienation, his incapacity to turn outward from the self, which is where all the pain is. Within and without, all is chaos and pain. In representing Rutherford's struggles to bring himself and his spir itual life into some accommodation with the world he faces, White controls our expectations by creating three alternatives for Rutherford. First, he can remain passive in the face of the misery of his circum stances, can succumb, for example, to the deadening effect that life among the Dissenters and Unitarians has on him, which threatens despair, alcoholism, hypochondria, and finally sheer panic. Second, he can perceive, and be attracted to the prospect of, connection with the divine, the Christ-like touch of someone who will care for him, eleva tion into an exalted spiritual and emotional state, with, say, the help of Handel and the company of friends. The possibility of a life that touches the infinite is so compelling that he cannot abandon it, in spite of the attraction of a third possibility. Third and finally, he can move toward some accommodation with the world and toward greater readi ness to settle for moments of happiness in the midst of reduced misery, the alternative he finally chooses. This possibility is kept before us in the examples presented by the Misses Arbour, the butterfly man, Mary Mardon, and Theresa Wollaston, people who have made adjust ments or, in Darwinian terms, adaptations that ease their sufferings. The possibility is also pressed by the older narrator who constantly suggests that at a later date he has learned some consoling lesson. "Only when I got much older," he says characteristically, "did I dis cern the duty of accepting life as God has made it, and thankfully receiving any scrap of love offered to me, no matter how imperfect it</page><page sequence="8">254 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 might be" (2:25). The curl of Rutherford's lip implicit in the words "scrap" and "imperfect" are, however, an indication that any fictive submission to this alternative will not come easily, given his perfec tionism, however much it promises to relieve the tension that drives him to such emotional extremes. Rutherford's contempt for anything less than the best takes on a life of its own. As readers, however, we can predict that he will move toward accommodation, away from the worst miseries and short of a fully spir itual life, although how far he will go may remain unclear. This alter native is made to seem likely because pursuit of the Christ-like possi bility tends to increase the likelihood that the worst will occur. That is, his pursuit of this possibility in his speculations and first efforts—pur suit of perfect human relationships and of responsiveness on the part of the infinite and the human—leads him to blunders, frustration, and misery, to failure in the ministry and to hypochondriacal panic at the prospect of teaching at a boys' school. Yet this path through humilia tion and sorrow also leads tacitly to greater understanding of the world, some capacity to endure, and greater freedom to live the life he wishes. Rutherford remarks ironically that when he was a boy, Sun days were "compensation" for the "perfect poetic pleasures" of child hood spent in the country (1:5), part of the bad compensations held in tension with the good in Rutherford's life. Pursuit of the best possibi lities, available only for brief moments, increases the incidence of the worst. In his pursuing the Christ-like, he pays dearly for what he wants, without getting much of it. Character, ideas, and circumstances combine to force Rutherford to view himself as one of a particular class of people—the weak, the com monplace, and the lonely, whose lives he hopes to make more bearable by the example of his own (1:2). He has a special susceptibility to depression and hypochondria, which at first encourages alcoholism and mental paralysis but which he gradually learns to suffer with greater patience. He is also prey to self-contempt and has a compulsive desire to confess his weaknesses, often interrupting the flow of the nar rative in order to do so. This habit is one of the elements of what we might agree with Gamini Salgado to call "the rhetoric of sincerity," and it encourages the impression that the work is confessional or auto biographical. White, however, binds this compulsion up with Ruther ford's view of the world. He makes Rutherford a weak character, lonely, not assertive, physically and spiritually susceptible, yet desir ous of something beyond what his circumstances make available. His ambition is extraordinary, springing from such unlikely circumstances</page><page sequence="9">Brookes action and apologue 255 and accompanied by such contempt for others and for ordinary ways of life. His predicament is tied to his ideas and beliefs, often explicated and sometimes misperceived. White's own views can be associated with idealism, which seeks ultimate reality through the spiritual ele ments of human experience. Maurice Mandelbaum points out that the nineteenth-century manifestations of idealism tended to "view God and the social world as synonymous" (35) and could accommodate Darwinism, identifying "true religion with a worship of the immanent power which was at work in nature, evolving higher forms of exis tence, bringing mankind out of crudity, ignorance, and selfishness into altruism, knowledge, and culture" (35). Rutherford's thinking is a var iation of this position and is implicit in the narrative from the begin ning, even though the younger Rutherford is supposed to be brought up as a Dissenter, implicit in the values inherent in the older narrator's judgments from the start, in the distinction between Rutherford's idyl lic weekdays as a child and his Sundays, in his susceptibility to Wordsworth, and in the readiness with which he moves to a secular ized view of Christ as a man who suffers. Basil Willey considers White "an embodiment of the Puritan spirit adrift in the Age of Agnosti cism" (186-87). But, if one puts one's knowledge of White's biogra phy aside, Rutherford is better considered an instinctive idealist who approaches agnosticism because of apparent failures of idealism, not of Calvinism. He comes to doubt his inherited Calvinism, although he never loses many Puritan tendencies, but he is never brought to give up an idealist position, religious and widely shared. Rutherford, in short, is a child of the nineteenth-century, not the seventeenth. Rutherford's idealism creates problems for him and somewhat puz zling formal signals for the reader because it takes an idiosyncratic and confining form. One of Rutherford's greatest difficulties stems from a set of metaphors that permeates his thinking and channels it along rather narrow lines. The central metaphor is that of scale of hierarchy: "On whatever lines the world may be framed, there must be distinc tion, difference, a higher and a lower; and the lower relatively to the higher, must always be an evil. The scale upon which the higher and lower both are, makes no difference. The supremest bliss would not be bliss if it were not definable bliss" (6:85). This view, which permits him to preserve the dualism of Calvinism within the frame of the one ness of idealism, comes down to a species of Darwinism: "The law of the universe everywhere is rather the perpetual rise from the lower to the higher; an immortality of aspiration after more perfect types; a suppression and happy forgetfulness of its comparative failures"</page><page sequence="10">256 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 (6:76). The protagonist's difficulty here is that he counts himself among the comparative failures, but he sees no reason why he should be and fears what Tennyson also feared in In Memoriam, that God in Darwinian form is careless of the individual. Only he feels it person ally. The metaphor of hierarchy reinforces related and powerful philo sophical pairs that Rutherford uses to divide up the world he encoun ters.9 Thus the ideal is set against the ordinary, the infinite against the commonplace, sympathy against coldness, emptiness or worldliness against spirituality. His categories, sustained by his idealism, give his judgments of others a Puritan severity. Either persons touch the uni versal, as he puts it, or they remain low and unworthy of such notice. Also, his sense of spiritual or moral hierarchy blends with his percep tion of the social scale in ways that confuse and frustrate him. He is constantly baffled that those, like himself, who deserve recognition, in part because they need it so badly, are not granted it. Worse, in pursu ing their own spiritual lights, that is, in being their best selves, they experience humiliation, shame, and frustration. When Mary Mardon sings, "He was despised," Rutherford seems to himself "to be listen ing to the tragedy of all human worth and genius" (6:90). Life after death might rectify the injustice of the world, but that solace is increasingly closed off. If justice is to be done, it must be done in this world, and it is not, at least insofar as he can tell. Still, he strives to raise himself on all of the scales that he perceives—or at least, on the social scale, to maintain himself and not to be put down. He dwells, for example, on what he views as the highest issues, finding the semi scientific activities of the reasonably well-adjusted butterfly collector to be "mere solemn trifling compared with the investigation of those great questions with which I had been occupied" (8:108). But he does not find himself in a just and responsive world, and his efforts tend to isolate him and to bring greater shame on him for his social and profes sional failures. White increases sympathy by making us see that Rutherford's thinking traps him in painful paradoxes. He looks inward, where he should find his own spiritual being and a link with the larger spirit, but he finds weakness and shame. He looks outward, and he sees some evidence of an immanent God but also a complex and apparently unjust reality that does not permit him to infer the coherent set of laws that govern the universe, that is, to know the mind of the prime mover. He is pushed toward atheism by Mardon, but he does not abandon the idea that an intelligence different from but greater than a human one operates in the world. "We are able to see," he concludes, "that the</page><page sequence="11">Brookes action and apologue 257 arrangements which we would make, if we had the control of the uni verse, would be more absurd than those that prevail now" (9:136), which is not a strong affirmation but also not atheism. We see that even the skeptic Mardon is susceptible to being moved by the spirit of the universe, which means that, in White's conception, he is a spiri tual being of a higher order. White controls our expectations for Rutherford by making us perceive that the nature of his fictive human beings makes atheism impossible. Rutherford's thinking is problematical in at least one other respect that has a direct bearing on our perception of form. A modern reader is likely to notice that much of what happens to him is a result of circum stances, occurrences over which no person has any control. He is raised, not by choice, in a Dissenting household and educated badly for the ministry. The options open to him are continuously narrowed by his situation; he does not have much control over what he does or whom he lives among. When the Unitarian congregation invites him to their pulpit, he remarks, "I pondered over the matter a good deal, and then reflected that in a case where every opening is barred save one, it is our duty not to plunge at an impassable barrier, but to take that one opening, however unpromising it may be" (7:96). He is unfortunate in his choice of women, with none of whom he can make a successful marriage. Moreover, he has little means of explaining how or why barriers lie before him in some directions and not in others. He despairs at understanding the workings of "the only God whom I knew, the forces which maintained the universe" (8:110). He is aware of the voices telling him to be patient, including Mardon's (whose per son and voice, like others, arise as reflexes of Rutherford's needs, not simply as accidents).10 Rutherford also knows something of the lesson of slow healing from his experience of depression and bad health, but his intellectual response to his predicament is not very penetrating, while his emotional and psychological response is powerful. Mary Mardon's refusal of him, because of her devotion to her father, simply drives him into an attack of monomania and that special misery that "lies in the belief that suffering of this kind is peculiar to ourselves" (7:98). He has no perspective on his circumstances, except to notice them as the occasion of his suffering. He tends to blame other people for his unhappiness, often for their passivity and want of spirit or sym pathy, and to turn upon himself. He acts as if he were stigmatized for some unknown reason, envious of others, deficient in himself, and per sonally responsible for much of what goes wrong. Rutherford's constant confessions of weakness, which seem eccen tric and compulsive, thus spring in part from his view of the world,</page><page sequence="12">258 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 from his temperament, and from his circumstances. And they can, incidentally, be best represented dramatically. When he rebuffs his petty nemesis Snale with justifiable anger, and Snale does an appropri ate pratfall, Rutherford cannot take any satisfaction in what has hap pened. Instead he turns on himself: "When I got home I bitterly regretted what had happened. I never regret anything more than the loss of self-mastery" (6:82).11 Even when circumstances, in the form of the stool on which Snale is sitting, slip in the right direction, he has no means of taking any satisfaction in them. He might notice, as the form of the work makes us do, that circumstances, in conjunction with the choices he makes—or refuses to make—indeed force events gradually in the direction of moderating his suffering and of making accommo dation more nearly possible. But Rutherford is not ready to perceive or accept fully the change. The fictions tells us what the protagonist's consciousness does not. White makes us understand this pattern in Rutherford's life, to know the interplay among his character, ideas, and circumstances, and to anticipate its consequences. The plot places intense pressure on Rutherford to make the accommodation; yet, as we have seen, his resistance to doing so, in spite of the pain he helps to bring on himself, makes him seem grimly heroic. Rutherford's last words to us are mor bid and pessimistic. For him "the hour of illumination has not yet come." He is even willing to resist ordinary Victorian optimism about inevitable progress, adding, "Whether it ever will come to a more nobly developed race, we cannot tell" (9:137). After Rutherford's nar ration ends, White has Reuben Shapcott assure us, as the older narra tor has tried to do all along, that Rutherford changes, not by giving up speculation entirely, but by being content gradually to "rest and wait" (9:139). White also has Shapcott promise some continuation of the narrative, which White obviously had in mind and which became Deliverance. The Rutherford encountered there, as we shall see, is a different man. In the Autobiography, however, White surely chose a natural way out of his dilemma, ending the narrative where he does and, in effect, sending Rutherford off on a long vacation. The task of making him into what Shapcott and the older narrator, at least overtly, seem to want him to become would not be easy, and the change is more easily implied than shown. In Mark Rutherford's Deliverance, White can present Rutherford more as he wishes him to be, without the difficulty of dramatizing the</page><page sequence="13">Brookes action and apologue 259 transformation. White has Shapcott remark that he hopes to recover additional portions of Rutherford's manuscript because "I am afraid that up to this point he has misrepresented himself, and that those who read his story will think him nothing but a mere egoist, selfish and self-absorbed" (9:139). In the Autobiography, Rutherford is these things and more, but he is not by the end of it transformed, as we should not be surprised to discover. Deliverance, on the other hand, proposes strategies of adaptation that an older Rutherford can at least contemplate. Deliverance is commonly taken to be less successful than the Autobi ography and to be less well made, usually as a consequence of applying the wrong standards. In it White shifts the focus onto the social impli cations of Rutherford's ideas, by presenting a series of examples of how different people have adapted to contemporary social conditions. This more generalized concern naturally disappoints those who seek implicit confession or disguised autobiography. The work's rather dif ferent form may make it seem less well constructed. Deliverance is dif ferent and needs to be judged on its own terms. Like the Autobiogra phy, it has an implicitly fictional form. Realistic and naturalistic as some of its episodes may seem, they are framed as fictional examples. As in the Autobiography, White certainly uses autobiographical as well as fictional materials, but both are presented as hypothetical and not as referring to something prior to the apparently fictional narrative. One suspends disbelief not because the events seem actually to have hap pened but because, given such conditions, such events could have hap pened. Rutherford is, as promised, presented in a much less egotistical light, but he is placed among other individuals facing analogous diffi culties. Interest in his fate is subordinated to a more generalized inter est in how these different people, including him, adapt to the condi tions of modern life. The result of this shift in emphasis is a different form, which satisfies several demands. White undoubtedly felt himself under considerable cultural pressure to close Rutherford's Byron and open his Goethe, to have him, like John Stuart Mill, overcome con cern for self by finding satisfaction in what is done for others (Mill, Autobiography 85-86).12 Further, White's fiction seems always to have an exploratory quality that leads him to hold up different individuals as specimens rather than linking them causally, in plots. Clara Hop good, for example is full of characters who break off the on-going story to recount their own lives or someone else's. In fact, the Autobiography is remarkable among his works in that there, in the work often taken to</page><page sequence="14">260 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 be his least fictional, he manages plotted fiction by subordinating bio graphies and biographical anecdotes to Rutherford's story, though not without visible effort. In Deliverance, he simply organizes his general concerns into a series of examples, subordinating interest even in the protagonist's specific fate to them. The break between the two works also allows him to avoid the difficulties he had in the Autobiography in bringing Rutherford to a less egotistical and more generous state of mind. In the introduction to his extremely useful collection, Ap proaches to Victorian Autobiography, George R Landow reiterates Wayne Shumaker's observation that many autobiographers have diffi culty representing the shift from adolescence to adulthood, from an unstable to a stable personality, as do, it might be added, many nine teenth-century novelists (xxix-xl). This difficulty, complicated by his somewhat truculent protagonist, encouraged White to exaggerate a common break in narratives of life stories by presenting the adult Rutherford in a second volume. Some confusion about the nature of Deliverance is plausible enough. It is more overtly philosophical and more discursive than the Autobiog raphy, and its narrative seems disjunctive, especially when it turns abruptly from from the plight of the London poor to the story of an eccentric woman Rutherford valued when a child. These subjects seem unrelated, as if this were a fictional representation of an unso phisticated autobiography in which anything relevant to the writer's thoughts and experiences could be included. But the subjects are related, analogous examples, tied more closely to the narrative scheme than appears at first. The narrative divides into two skeins. The first recounts Rutherford's and his friend M'Kay's attempts to save souls in Drury Lane; the second traces, by an unannounced route, the course of events leading to Rutherford's marriage and relative happiness with Ellen, the girl to whom he was engaged for a time in the Autobiogra phy. These qualities in Deliverance are not necessarily weaknesses but are in fact signs of a different and coherent intention. Within this nar rative frame, White embeds his set of fictional examples of persons who adapt or are helped to adapt to the spiritlessness of modern life, in particular to the suffering caused by "the neglect or oppression of man" (5:213). Deliverance approaches the form that Sheldon Sacks describes as an apologue or work "organized as a fictional example of the truth of a formulable statement or a series of such statements" (Sacks 26). White exemplifies what Rutherford calls "the religion of the Reconciliation, the reconciliation of man with God," which is achieved by "making it my duty of duties to suppress revolt, and sub</page><page sequence="15">Brookes action and apologue 261 mit calmly and cheerfully to the Creator" (6:228). He does not pre scribe passivity; but he promotes quiet adaptation to one's situation, seeking by one practical means or another to make life bearable. He shows, again, that if one adapts and assumes the proper attitude, then there will be "some compensation" (6:229), perhaps even momentary joy. There is less rebelliousness here and less passionate self-destruc tiveness than in the Autobiography. Deliverance is more self-assured and in some ways more coherent, although its coherence is different. As in the Autobiography, no overt claims are made that the examples are based on actual experience, yet so compelling is the conviction that they must be authentic that their implicit coherence may be over looked, even though it is based on formal principles prone to stimulate invention. For example, White's presentation of the wretched of Drury Lane has always seemed puzzling to those who assume that he is presenting a version of his own experience. Although, as Stone has shown, White had some knowledge of Drury Lane, he did no such social work. Still, Stone insists, these are "sociological studies which could have been drawn only from life" (138). If one frees oneself from the idea that White is representing his own prior experience, then one can see that while these characters may be drawn from some observa tion, they are certainly drawn from conviction, from belief in a certain approach to suffering. The work is not modified a whit if, as appears the case, White made the whole episode up. White describes these Drury Lane characters both in order to show how the doctrine of Renunciation can work even in the least probable cases and to show that human progress is possible in spite of fears about the ignorant masses. Some of his concern is contemporary, that is, focused on current debate about extension of the franchise. Ruther ford remarks that decisions in Parliament, where he, like White, has become a reporter, are now made in ignorance, which some take to be an argument against extending the franchise. But, Rutherford count ers, the average dock worker has better reasons for doing what he does than do the Members. Indeed, he finds a heightened sensitivity in the multitude "to impressions to which men hedged round by impregna ble conventionalities cannot yield" (1:149). White includes a footnote: "This was written many years ago, but is curiously pertinent to the discussions of this year.—EDITOR, 1984" (1:149). Of course the pas sage was not written many years before, and White wants to show, by hypothetical example, that human progress and compensation through Renunciation are possible even for the least of those who might come to share power in the future. "I wondered," Rutherford says, "how</page><page sequence="16">262 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 men could be worth anything if they could never see the face of nature. . . . Hope, faith, and God seemed impossible among the smoke of the streets" (1:149). White has him find what seems impossible, although not without some trial. In representing this foray into Voluntaryism, White is responding to a movement in the 1880's to provide, either through organized reli gions or by other means, for the material and spiritual needs of the urban poor (see Inglis 62-74). White wishes first to suggest some of the ways in which hope, faith, and God are not likely to be applied successfully in this environment. He has Rutherford and his friend M'Kay, who appears serious about religion, observe the hopelessness both of Sunday worship in London and of the spectacle of free thinkers baiting an orthodox preacher. M'Kay, however, perceives a more hopeful alternative, seeing "in the history of all great religious movements, a record of the improvement of the human race, or of large portions of it, not merely by gradual civilisation, but by inspira tion spreading itself suddenly" (2:167). Through Rutherford's experi ence White shows that in actuality much less can be hoped for, but that by ministering in small ways to the immediate needs of the few men who seek help, M'Kay and Rutherford can improve their lives. Neither orthodox religion nor inspiration will assist these men, but some compensation can be achieved by personal, practical aid, which demands that they be seen as individuals with particular needs. Part of White's radicalism is his willingness to see, at least imaginatively, Christ-like suffering at the extreme of the human order, "at the bottom of the great cities" (5:209). At first Rutherford, faced with the "ball of adamant" of Drury Lane can only "faintly, and I was about to say stu pidly, hope—for I had no rational, tangible grounds for hoping—that some force of which we are not aware might some day develop itself which will be able to resist and remove the pressure which sweeps and crushes into a hell, sealed from the upper air, millions of human souls every year in one quarter of the globe alone" (5:209-10). Partial grounds for hope, White demonstrates, lie in the ability of M'Kay and Rutherford to save a few. Thus the account of their work in Drury Lane is an attempt to exemplify the power of certain ideas applied where they appear least likely of success. White's essentially fictional, narrative form allows him to make his ideas more credible by making them seem drawn from as well as tested by experience. Abruptly at the start of Chapter III, "Miss Leroy," White breaks off Rutherford's account of the Drury Lane experiment, turning to what appears a random reminiscence of childhood. Gradually it becomes</page><page sequence="17">Brookes ACTION AND APOLOGUE 263 obvious that he is pursuing the second skein of his narrative, the his tory of the woman Rutherford eventually marries, who had become the widow of the son of the former Miss Leroy. This narrative link is weak, and, partly as a consequence, the analogical link among her, the London poor, Rutherford, and other emerging characters becomes stronger. Miss Leroy turns out to be another outsider who must adapt to the conditions of life, which in her case are the confines of a small and narrow-minded town, with the aid of unorthodox and somewhat eccentric Christianity. Like M'Kay she takes Jesus for her God, although she remains somewhat pagan in her intolerance of the weak and foolish (3:179). She takes the practical step of marrying George Butts, a placid local miller, and gains great freedom to pursue her own ways. "Thus," concludes Rutherford, "did Mrs. Butts live among us, as an Arabian bird with its peculiar habits, cries, and plumage might live in one of our barnyards with the ordinary barn-door fowls" (3:184). Mrs. Butts offers a contrast with Mrs. M'Kay, who suffers quietly from her husband's intolerance of her weaknesses. Rutherford describes her immediately at the end of the previous chapter, and her passivity may have brought the more aggressive Miss Leroy/Mrs. Butts to White's mind. Both women must be appreciated, and Ruther ford testifies to Mrs. Butts's place in his heart and in his memory, "with all her faults and eccentricities," especially because she was "one of the very very few whom I have ever seen who knew how to love a child" (3:185). White uses her son, Clem, to invert her eccentricity into a contrast ing attitude that is anathema to Rutherford, "that the inferior ought to render perpetual incense to the superior, and that the superior should receive it as a matter of course" (3:189). The outwardly superior Clem is a kind of compensating evil to offset his mother's precious qualities and influence. White's interest in bad marriages has often been noticed, but he also seems to see a similar principle operating in fami lies generally, in which good people, capable of some happiness, are linked to bad or at least troublesome ones. The butterfly man in the Autobiography has a deranged son, and Rutherford in Deliverance has a troubled step-daughter. Clem, presented according to a simple rhetori cal principle of contrast, is a negative example, another oppressor of the neglected and unrecognized, whose power to wound is heightened by his success in the world and whose passions are unrestrained by Christianity. Through Clem, White leads back to Ellen, Rutherford's former fiancee, a more positive example, with a more direct bearing on</page><page sequence="18">264 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 Rutherford. Clem marries her but encounters a squire's wife who agrees with him about the privileges of talent. This view is rebutted abruptly by the squire who surprises them in a familiar moment at the piano and drives Clem out of town. Clem's wife suffers, naturally, from his treatment of her. She also turns to the Bible and especially to Christ, although in a more traditonal Calvinistic way than do M'Kay and Miss Leroy. Rutherford discourses at some length about her Cal vinism, asserting that it represents "a philosophy which is a necessity in all ages. 'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.' This is the last word which can be said" (4:206). The consoling idea in this philosophy is that "for each individual soul there is a vocation as real as if that soul were alone upon the planet" (4:207). This view is stated with more conviction than in the Autobiography, and it accounts for White's desire to exemplify the "destiny which shall take care of every atom of life on the globe" at work in numerous lives, rather than in just one. Rutherford calls his discussion of these ideas "a long digression which I did not intend" and says that he was simply "anxious to show how Mrs. Butts met her trouble through her religion" (4:207). The discus sion is hardly a digression. Having shown that religion can work in two different modern lives, according to individual needs and voca tions, White has Rutherford return to the least probable cases, the oppressed of Drury Lane. His somewhat awkward organization has rhetorical advantages, since he returns us to Drury Lane more inclined to find credible the examples of success there. A characteristic Victorian double impulse is at work in these exam ples of dealings with the lower classes. Rutherford wants to save indi vidual souls, but he also fears the apocalypse that will come if nothing is done to stem the corruption loose in the districts of the poor. Social as well as spiritual progress depends on the outcome. The needs of the four men and one woman whom Rutherford describes are "intensely practical and special" (6:226), to be met by changing jobs or other adaptive strategies, not by the orthodox and uniform strategies of church or chapel, or, it should be noted, by Carlylean devotion to work. White, like Ruskin, had learned that the modern world creates tedious, repressive work that constitutes slavery. The spiritual needs of these people are met by Rutherford's doctrine of the Reconciliation, not by rebellion against the conditions of life, but by calm and even cheerful submission to the Creator (6:228). Rutherford and M'Kay's solution maintains a Protestant emphasis on the individual, demand ing personal and not, for example, class remedies.</page><page sequence="19">Brookes ACTION AND APOLOGUE 265 From this more impersonal concern with the poor, White returns to the line of the narrative leading to Rutherford's marriage to Ellen Butts, exemplifying in the process the limited possibilities of happi ness available more easily within the confines of private rather than public life. Each provides some compensation for the prior misery of the other, but, as Rutherford remarks, there are no epochs in life as there are in novels, no situations that fix a person's remaining career (8:246). Momentary joy is compensated by new misery. Rutherford's clerical work becomes almost as degrading as that of the men he has helped, and he applies the same kinds of remedies, securing for him self some freedom by isolating his family life from his work, seeking the best in literature, feeling the power of his wife's love, the kind of love that a despised menial can appreciate, since "those who are pros perous and courted cannot understand its power" (8:252). Rutherford becomes, again, another example of the truth of the ideas that concern White in the book. His wife's daughter, likewise, indicates conditions under which the most troublesome personality can flower forth, in this case in response to her mother's illness. This small family finally comes to some joy on a holiday after Ellen's recovery. But of course the joy is only momentary, and Rutherford dies shortly thereafter, appar ently of a stroke suffered after he was abused by his tyrannical supe rior. His employers respond meanly, sending his salary to the date of his death and then his belongings, "carriage unpaid" (9:272). We could expect little more. As Reuben Shapcott promised, Deliverance presents a less egotistical Rutherford. Here White uses him to tell us about the lives of numer ous suffering individuals, not just his own, and rather than watching Rutherford himself founder in his struggle for answers to complex questions, we are shown repeatedly the efficacy of a certain attitude toward life. For this reason the book has a less unsettling effect. Although there are occasional lapses, places where just a bit of polish ing would have made the narrative seem less disjunctive, the work is quite carefully arranged to show how different lives can be improved. Deliverance is thus well shaped to fulfill a purpose, but the purpose is different from that of the Autobiography, which, while it is not neces sarily better shaped, has a dramatic form that most readers are likely to find more engaging. The two works are of a piece. The second allows White to avoid representing dramatically what would have proved a baffling but necessary transition from a Byronic Rutherford to the Goethean one. It also allows him to shift to a different fictional form better suited to the more general view he wished to embody—the indi</page><page sequence="20">266 biography Vol. 9, No. 3 vidual egoist requires the fictive first person autobiography, while the narrative of collective careers requires the kalaidoscope of example. Fiction and "message" are one. While Deliverance is not less well con structed, it is likely that the Autobiography, with its special, personal intensity, will remain the favorite of most readers. The younger Rutherford, "Wandering between two worlds, one dead,/The other powerless to be born," remains a powerful image of a particular human plight (Arnold, "Stanzas" lines 85-86).13 The hero of Deliverance delivers himself in ways that our civilization has not yet adopted. Both works use autobiographical and fictional materials, and while they thus spring from mixed sources, they have coherent forms that do something other than reveal or half-reveal the life of the author. The form is the content, and it is not autobiography. University of Nebraska-Lincoln NOTES 1. This distinction between apologues and plotted narratives is made by Sheldon Sacks in his first chapter. See also Ralph W. Rader's revision of Sack's model of narratives that are imitations of actions (33-34). Others who have argued that the works are fictional, on grounds different from mine, include Gamini Salgado, who argues that the Autobiography is a novel, because it has a the matic organization, and that Deliverance is not. In fact, Deliverance, not the Autobiography, has a thematic organization. Irvin Stock argues loosely, in spite of the identity he sees between White and Rutherford, that the book is a novel organized around the theme of the conflict between reality and dream (92). 2. As W. Eugene Davis points out, White used Rutherford's name as a pseudonym selectively, in publishing subsequent fiction and some other works, including journals and this autobiography (97). 3. White also identified specific passages in the two books as autobiographical. See pp. 79 and 85 of Early Life and his remarks about the two works in The Groombridge Diary. 4. Wilfred H. Stone, for example, follows Howells, adding that the works possess slight fictional coloring and no plot and calling them "spiritual autobiogra phy" (122). Stephen Merton argues that both the Autobiography and Deliver ance are autobiographical and have no plot. 5. Stone points out that Froude's book was published by John Chapman, for whom White worked (50n; see also 172). White had been reading Froude's Bunyan (see White, "Froude" 313). Mark Rutherford's name echoes that of Froude's protagonist, Markham Sutherland, sufficiently to suggest the possibility of a further connection. 6. For an extreme statement of the view that works bearing little overt resemblance to narratives of their author's lives should nonetheless be considered autobiogra phy, see William C. Spengemann.</page><page sequence="21">Brookes action and apologue 267 7. The argument made here follows Aristotle through R. S. Crane, Elder Olson, Sheldon Sacks, Ralph W. Rader, and Richard Levin. 8. Jina Politi emphasizes this distinction as it appears in Aristotle (17-24). 9. Chaim Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca discuss philosophical pairs (411-59). 10. Harry W. McCraw remarks that "every time Rutherford is faced with a different problem or situation, just then he meets with someone whose character and history are in some way helpful to him (45). 11. The idea of self-discipline seems to have been pervasive at the time White was writing. Owen Chadwick says that orthodoxy "believed with monk or puritan that goodness was to be found through the discipline of the self' (119). 12. In the same vein, Arnold says, "It turns out that the only real happiness is in a kind of impersonal higher life, where the happiness of others counts with a man as essential to his own" ("Preface" 157). 13.
