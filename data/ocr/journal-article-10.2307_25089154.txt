<plain_text><page sequence="1">John C. Elder John Muir and the Literature of Wilderness npHERE is a flourishing tract of contemporary American litera -* ture which could be called the genre of naturalist autobiography. Important representative volumes include Aldo Leopold's Sand County Almanac, Loren Eiseley's Immense Journey, Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire, Gary Snyder's Turtle Island, and Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. The grouping of these books within one genre reflects the fact that each is an amalgam of the same three elements: close observation of nature, within an awareness of the modern science of ecology; a journal of the author's own growth, by means of that in tense relation to nature; and speculation about larger religious and political issues connected with the cause of wilderness-preservation. The influence of this literature of wilderness has been tremendous. Not only have these books been very widely read (Desert Solitaire has been through five printings since 1971, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek has been through six since 1974), but they have also had special impact on a couple of important constituencies. All the authors I named are used in college courses ranging from literature to philosophy to biology, as well as in interdisciplinary approaches to such subjects as environmental ethics. They contribute to a new naturalist canon, as well, and thus help to form the positions of the major conservationist organizations. Members of Audubon, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth read these books, their groups' magazines quote from them regularly, and figures like Abbey, Snyder, and Dillard come to function as updated Victorian Sages, who are called upon for words of encouragement or guidance as new crises arise. This group of figures seems to constitute a movement as well as a genre, but it is difficult to get a fix on its program. One reason for this difficulty is obvious: the cluster of books listed here spans only the last thirty years; the environmental movement and its literature are still growing fast. The other reason?at least as important?is the particu larity of these books; each centers around one person's response to details of a certain environment. Even the religious and political sug 375</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review gestions are loops, curving back soon to the books' specific place and time. John Muir, who lived from 1838 to 1914, is the individual to whom we can turn for clarification of the assumptions and directions of this new literature of wilderness. Often referred to as the father of the national park system, for his efforts to preserve the wild places of the Sierra Nevada, he was also the author of ten volumes and of numerous newspaper and magazine articles. His writings fit the criteria of the modern genre I have been describing; in addition, his historical setting and his style are such that he reveals a general pattern of response to nature, which may be discerned largely intact in the work of his twentieth-century successors. One reason that Muir is able to clarify the values and contours of subsequent American wilderness-literature is that, both chronologically and thematically, he stands midway between current writers and the Transcendentalists. On the mantel of his ranchhouse in Martinez, Cali fornia, Muir had two portraits, one of Emerson and one of Thoreau. It is evident that he took to heart Emerson's exhortation in "Nature" for a "religion by revelation," whereby we meet God face-to-face in the beautiful countenance of the natural world. Even Muir's early understanding of what we now call ecology might perhaps be traced back to Emerson's insistence that "Nothing is quite beautiful alone; nothing but is beautiful in the whole." The entire story of his adventur ous and cheerful outdoor life also shows how fully he embraced Tho reau's faith: "While I enjoy the friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me." In looking at John Muir's writings we also see his important diver gences from his mentors both in matters of style and in basic attitudes towards nature. Muir certainly perpetuates the teaching of Emerson and Thoreau that solitude in nature is the state most conducive to genuine enlightenment. But what he actually finds in the wilderness does not confirm the other doctrines of the Concord philosophers, so much as it looks ahead to the beliefs of current naturalists. Both as a writer and as a political figure, it is Muir, and not his Transcendentalist models, who embodies the basic assumptions of our environmental movement. The key to John Muir's style, and to one of his differences from earlier naturalist traditions, is suggested in the terms of his disappoint ment when Emerson, who met Muir at Yosemite, was hurried away by his entourage before he could go camping. Such an early departure, 376</page><page sequence="3">The Literature of Wilderness Muir protested, was "as if a photographer should remove his plate before the impression was fully made." This image of the human being as a photographic plate, gradually beautified through exposure to natu ral forms, is one Muir returns to. Like Jonathan Edwards and D. H. Lawrence, his fellow religious sensualists, Muir knows that it is imme diate experience, not its literary reflection, that finally has transforming power; the writer can at best only direct the reader's attention towards the really important things: No amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to know these moun tains. As well seek to warm the naked and frost bitten by lectures on caloric and pictures of flame. One day's exposure to mountains is better than car loads of books. See how willingly Nature poses herself upon photographer's plates. No earthly chemicals are so sensitive as those of the human soul. All that is required is exposure, and purity of material. "The pure in heart shall see God!" This imagery, suggesting that the human being needs only a recep tive attitude towards the earth, expresses Muir's conviction of nature's active autonomy. It also nicely fits Muir into the progression of En lightenment and Romantic assumptions about nature, as it recalls John Locke's image of the camera obscura. This invention?a dark room with a tiny hole in the door, through which an image of an object held outside the door was projected upside-down onto the opposite wall ?was the forerunner of the modern camera. It also seemed to Locke the perfect symbol for the human mind: no ideas were possible except for those immediately derived from the external world by way of the senses. This denigration of the mind's imaginative, creative powers out raged the early English Romantics, Who countered it with the model of the Aeolian Harp. In the poem of that title, just before he is stifled by the "mild reproof" of his new wife, "pensive Sara," Coleridge asks, Or what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd, That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the soul of each, and God of all? In this metaphor, so much more flattering to the poet's self-esteem, the mind still depends in a general way on nature for its activity, but de rives new and characteristic melodies from its own unique framing. 377</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review In returning to the camera for his imagery of mind, Muir avoids that inherent passivity which so much annoyed the Romantics in the camera obscura: the camera has become portable in the meantime, allowing the person a decision to be an active photographer, carrying his plate to the glaciers or cities of his choice. At the same time, it re veals the greater independence and concreteness Muir grants nature. Rather than being merely universal and plastic, the earth is allowed complex, particular life beyond all human response. Human life is de veloped by nature, but that is not nature's point. The world is full of objects as real as the human mind, and of creatures who live as fully as we do. This is a doctrine so automatically accepted by Muir's con servationist successors and, in day-to-day life, by most people as to appear self-evident. But it is Muir's departure within naturalist models of mind; and it is a concept just now beginning to venture out of its literary bird-sanctuary and into the serious debate over public policy. Many human prerogatives fall away when we perceive the truly independent life of other creatures. Muir's response, while cruising along the coast of Alaska, to the return of his companions from hunt ing makes it clear what a radical perception this really is: "From the shepherd to the red-handed hunter, it is the same; no recognition of rights,?only murder in one form or another." This implicit demand for a wilderness Bill of Rights was recalled by a recent case before the Supreme Court; it was argued that Mineral King Wilderness Area of California had as much legal integrity as a corporation, for example, and thus had a basic right not to be destroyed by Walt Disney Enter prises' projected ski-resort. This argument did not prevail (though, for other reasons, neither did Disney), but its line of thought has been further extended in Christopher Stone's book, Should Trees Have Standing? Muir's belief in nature's autonomy has its important stylistic corol lary, the attempt to give a very clear and detailed account of just what he has seen in the wilderness. It has to be admitted that Muir's writing lacks the synthetic power of Emerson or the wonderfully inventive language of Thoreau; it is also inferior to that of a number of his natura list successors in these regards. But it is unexcelled as a vivid and focused description of particular natural scenes. Muir always wants to start fresh with the facts of his experience. A revealing anecdote is that, when leaving Wisconsin on his first long walk?a 1,000 mile hike to the Gulf of Mexico?Muir turned down a copy of Virgil's bucolic poems offered to him by a teacher; he did not want any literary filters 378</page><page sequence="5">The Literature of Wilderness over his lens. The cost of such lack of sophistication is occasional stiff ness or sentimentality when Muir is expressing an opinion in his writ ing. But it liberates him from Cartesian dualism and the anxiety of influence alike, leaving him free to look closely at the rocks and trees and birds he comes upon in his journeying. Intellectuality, in its reduc tive or idealist tendencies, can put on blinders to the world's shifting multiplicity. At one point in "Nature" Emerson writes, "There is in woods and waters a certain enticement and flattery, together with a failure to yield a present satisfaction. This disappointment is felt in every landscape." Edwin Teale relates that here, in the margin of his copy of Emerson, Muir writes, "No?always we find more than we ex pect." Unburdened with too many abstractions, Muir approaches nature with attentiveness and humility. Although not overly knowledgeable about literature or philosophy, John Muir was far from an ignorant man. He knew a great deal about science?specifically botany and geology?and this understanding, with its accompanying terminology, does much to enrich both his apprecia tion of nature and his writing style. On the simplest level, the Latin terms for animals and flowers which he uses regularly seem to empha size the objective reality of those creatures, to keep them from being absorbed too quickly as mere aesthetic effects. Picicorvus Columbianus may finally be as much of a human imposition as the name Clark Crow, but with its sacramental obscurity it draws our respectful notice to the litde bird. His deep interest in geology gives further weight to Muir's observa tion of natural phenomena. He countered the official "cataclysmic" explanation of Yosemite's formation with his own observation that the rocks had been carved by glaciers, and that remnants of those glaciers could still be seen at work in the valley's river headlands. Eventually vindicated in this bold opinion by other scientists, Muir used his aware ness of the vast scale of geological formation and time to tie together his climbs and inspections, to link boulder fields and Half Dome in a continuing cosmic drama. Science thus legitimized Muir's close attention to the grooves on rocks, at the same time that it helped him and his readers to make large affirmations about the natural process. John Muir, both in his exploration and in his writing, had a taste for the sublime: thunderstorms, blizzards on the mountaintops, bears, glacial ravines. With nature at its most monumental, it is hard for a writer's emotional responses not to overwhelm his description. Here, too, Muir's acute scientific eye helps him hold onto his sense of nature's 379</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review concrete reality. In a celebrated passage in The Mountains of California, Muir writes that The most magnificent storm phenomenon I ever saw, surpassing in showy grandeur the most imposing effects of clouds, floods, or avalanches, was the peaks of the High Sierra, back of Yosemite Valley, decorated with snow banners. . . Innumerable peaks, black and sharp, rose grandly into the dark blue sky, their bases set in solid white, their sides streaked and splashed with snow, like ocean rocks with foam; and from every summit, all free and unconfused, was streaming a beautiful silky silvery banner, from half a mile to a mile in length, slender at the point of attachment, then widening gradually as it extended from the peak until it was about 1000 or 1500 feet in breadth, as near as I could tell. Such waving sheets of airborne snow would be just the sort of startling natural effect to make a poet like Wordsworth see the earth as erupting into imagination; Book I of The Prelude describes this visionary trans formation : The surface of the universal earth With triumph and delight, with hope and fear, Workfs] like a sea. Muir, though he also celebrates the amazing spectacle, characteristically substitutes scientific explanation for suggestions of transcendence. He points out that this is an effect of dry, pulverized snow, and goes on to observe that No perfect banner is ever hung on the Sierra peaks by a south wind. . . In general the south sides are convex and irregular, while the north sides are concave both in their vertical and horizontal sections; the wind in ascending these curves converges towards the summits, carrying the snow in concen trating currents with it, shooting it almost straight up into the air above the peaks, from which it is then carried away in a horizontal direction. Like Melville with his cetology or Thomas Mann with his biochemis try, Muir goes so far into the scientific data of sublime phenomena that, rather than throwing cold water on the initial wonder, he fires it with facts which testify to its reality, and are endlessly suggestive in them selves. This double contribution of science to an appreciation of the natural world is an important element in the writing of twentieth century naturalists. Nowhere is it more beautifully evident than in a chapter of Loren Eiseley's Immense Journey entitled "The Judgment 380</page><page sequence="7">The Literature of Wilderness of the Birds." Whereas Tennyson felt all human values to be challenged by the fossils of vanished species, Eiseley stands in the Badlands thinking of creatures who roamed there fifty million years earlier, and feels a spiritual circuit completed: The carbon that had driven them ran blackly in the eroding stone. The stain of iron was in the clays. The iron did not remember the blood it had once moved within, phosphorus had forgot the savage brain. The little individual moments had ebbed from all those strange combinations of chemicals as it would ebb from our living bodies into the sinks and runnels of oncoming time. I had lifted up a fistful of that ground. I held it while that wild flight of south-bound warblers hurtled over me into the oncoming dark. There went phosphorus, there went iron, there went carbon, there beat the calcium in those hurrying wings. Alone on a dead planet I watched that incredible miracle speeding by. For one who cultivates an intense love of nature while resisting transcendent values, the obvious pitfall is anthropomorphism. Edward Abbey, like the other contemporary writers I have grouped with him, acknowledges this problem early on in Desert Solitaire: "The personifi cation of the natural is exactly the tendency I wish to suppress in my self." Yet a couple of pages later he also asserts that "We are obliged ... to spread the news, painful and bitter though it may be for some to hear, that all living things on earth are kindred." Abbey's resolution of this tension also informs John Muir's writing: that comprehension of complex natural interdependence which we now call ecology. This is Muir's refrain: There are no square-edged inflexible lines in Nature. We seek to establish a narrow line between ourselves and the feathery zeros we dare to call angels, but ask a partition barrier of infinite width to show the rest of creation its proper place. . . Most people are on the world but not in it?have no con scious sympathy or relationship to anything about them?undiffused, separate, and rigidly alone like marbles of polished stone, touching, but separate. Muir and his naturalist followers find that a knowledge of ecology rehabilitates the belief in nature's essential unity. One need not dissolve natural phenomena into the Godhead to perceive their unity; neither is it necessary to plant sermons in stones. As Loren Eiseley saw, the air we breathe and the blood in our veins circulate through wide-mouthed bass and warblers. From microbe to man, populations of different species 381</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review prey on and protect each other. Such an insight into the larger balance also restores the reputation of much-maligned predators. Muir particu larly loved bears, though he had the sense not to stand too close while admiring them; writers today proclaim the beauty and necessity of coyote and timber wolf, and their right to a place in the cycle of life. This ecological outlook is a very valuable element in the literature of wilderness, a way of affirming the pattern of everything, without the necessity of a sentimental gloss over certain details. Annie Dillard, working from her deep knowledge of the super-violent realm of insects, finds in her science the justification for this lyrical affirmation: I am a frayed and nibbled survivor in a fallen world, and I am getting along. I am aging and eaten and have done my share of eating too. I am not washed and beautiful, in control of a shining world in which everything fits, but instead am wandering awed about on a spinning wreck I've come to care for. Her thorough scientific understanding of how human life is integrated into the exchanges and balance of the bio-sphere releases Dillard from Thoreau's idealist revulsion, as when he says, "The wonder is how they, you and I, can live this slimy beastly life, eating and drinking." The implicit determinants of Muir's style, then, and of the styles of his successors, are the conviction of nature's reality and worth beyond any human scheme of values and the understanding of the earth as a whole-system. A more obvious, but equally important, stylistic factor is this wilderness literature's political motivation. Muir's writing, like that of the forester Aldo Leopold, issues from personal experience, and like Leopold's it has an avowed intention to transform the attitudes of the readers and, eventually, the policy of the nation towards wilder ness. National parks and forests from California to Alaska bear Muir's name, and testify to his effectiveness as a constant lobbyist for nature. The continuing importance of the Sierra Club, which he founded and then headed for the first two decades of its existence, speaks for his skill as an organizer. He would write an article, take Teddy Roosevelt camping?anything for the cause of natural preservation. It was when he wrote of particular conservation needs that Muir adopted the prophetic tone which current writers also know how to use. He has been to the mountaintop and, in the beauty of wilderness, walked with God. One of his prophetic messages is exhortation: "Come to the woods, for here is rest. . . The galling harness of civilization drops off, and we are healed ere we are aware." The other message is stern 382</page><page sequence="9">The Literature of Wilderness reproof. Having won the battle for Yosemite, Muir turns his attention to Hetch Hetchy, a beautiful valley doomed to be the victim of an unnecessary water project. This fated, and largely unknown, wilderness incited Muir to prophetic anger: These temple destroyers, devotees of raging commercialism, seem to have a perfect contempt for Nature, and, instead of lifting their eyes to the God of the mountains, lift them to the Almighty Dollar. Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for watertanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man. The same anger shivers through the contemporary literature of wilder ness. Abbey assumes even Muir's imagery when, in 1968, he anticipates the stupid damming of Glen Canyon as equivalent to burying Chartres Cathedral in mud. Hetch Hetchy and Glen Canyon were both inun dated, but writers like Muir and Abbey played important parts in the long batdes which saved Yosemite and the Grand Canyon from similar schemes. A last point to make about style is that Muir's persona was and re mains a major element in his literary impact. Like Whitman and Hemingway, Muir, with his magnificent beard, was the subject of very impressive photographic portraits. He was the most adventurous of our authors, alone in the first ascent of numerous mountains, living in the wilderness for weeks at a time with no shelter and only a sackful of bread crumbs by way of provisions. His story and his person continue to impress people who have never read his books. He is a saint of the environmental movement, with the Sierra Club calendars and books as his icons. This brings us, by the long route, from literary style to the religion of nature. I have tried to isolate the elements of John Muir's style which characterize the modern literature of wilderness. Now I want to syn thesize a more general understanding of Muir as he bears on the ecology movement's religious directions. I believe that John Muir suc cessfully breaks a trail between two opposed, unsatisfactory approaches which have dominated human responses to the rest of the natural world. For purposes of simplification I will identify the poles of opposition as the Protestants and the Pythagoreans; taking away the capitals, one might also say the earth-movers and the idealists. By Protestant I want only to indicate that element of the Judaeo Christian tradition associated with the work-ethic, wherein, as Gary Snyder puts it, "men are seen as working out their ultimate destinies 383</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review (paradise? perdition?) with planet earth as the stage for the drama? trees and animals mere props, nature a vast supply depot." In a widely quoted 1967 essay in Science, entitled "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis," Lynn White argues that the problem is inherent in Christianity : To a Christian a tree can be no more than a physical fact. The whole con cept of a sacred grove is alien to Christianity and to the ethos of the West. For nearly two millennia Christian missionaries have been chopping down sacred groves, which are idolatrous because they assume spirit in nature. . . We shall continue to have a worsening ecological crisis until we reject the Christian axiom that nature has no reason for existence save to serve man. White's brush is a little broad, as when he promotes a practice to an axiom in the space of a page. But it is also undeniable that our highest religious values have all too often countenanced contempt for the earth and for the other creatures living on it. The idealist pole could as easily (and reductively) be termed Plato nist, Johannine, Hindu, or Transcendentalist. I choose Pythagorean because of a charming admission made by Thoreau in Waiden. After a lengthy account of how on his two and a half cultivated acres he "made the earth say beans instead of grass," he adds, "Not that I wanted beans to eat, for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned . . . and exchanged them for rice." In addition to sharing the ancient philosopher's avoidance of beans, Thoreau follows Pythagorus in the belief that divine spirit houses throughout the physical world, and that we should therefore avoid all unnecessary killing of animals. So far, the idealist position conforms more closely to Muir's love of nature than does the Judaeo-Christian tradition as presented by White. But it is finally too ready to see nature as merely mediate, its beans to be sold once one has learned the wisdom of their growing. Waiden is one of our supreme celebrations of nature; but Thoreau's many appreciative references to the Bhagavad Gita also prepare us for this serious pun: "If you would avoid uncleanness, and all sins, work earnestly, even if it is only at cleaning a stable. Nature is hard to overcome, but she must be overcome." This is the counter-problem to the work-ethic where, though nature is viewed as lifeless, it is at least experienced as substantial, offering enough gratifying resistance to make the chain-saw snarl and the bulldozer snort. But the idealists declare the forms of this world mere shadows; once nature has revealed the divinity within it, they hasten to lose themselves in light. 384</page><page sequence="11">The Literature of Wilderness In order to distinguish John Muir from both these unfortunate tendencies, I would call him a Christian pantheist, without much em phasis on either word. From his boyhood in Scotland to his youth on a Wisconsin homestead, Muir was steeped in the rigid Calvinism of his father. In his memoirs he describes how, by the age of twelve, he could recite the New Testament straight through, as well as large portions of the Hebrew scriptures, having "memorized them by heart and sore flesh." Considering the fanaticism under which he suffered, it is not surprising that Muir was never much drawn to theology or organized religion. But, as has been evident in previous quotations, Biblical lan guage is as distinctive an element of Muir's writing as scientific terminol ogy is; thus, his hymns to nature resonate with the ecstatic or devotional passages of natural description in Genesis, the Psalms, and the Parables of Jesus. Muir's language suggests the terms for a critique of Lynn White. Those who would reduce the Biblical account of creation to a rationale for a mechanistic ethic discount the relish with which Genesis catalogues "the moving creature that hath life." It does not seem right to blame the sky above Los Angeles on a Psalm that begins "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork." In short, it was scarcely by considering the lilies of the field that we created the present ecological crisis. It is obvious that western civilization badly needs to re-order its assumptions about nature. But it is equally certain, as the writings of Milton and Wordsworth as well as Muir acknowledge, that the Bible presents us with an im portant model of delight in a creation of creatures. Biblical language is the vehicle with which Muir expresses his dis covery of spirit throughout nature. During a heavy downpour in Alaska, he sees the trees as "gray-bearded patriarchs bowing low and chanting in passionate worship!" In a giddy letter, after having drunk some juice from a redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), he writes: I wish I were so drunk and Sequoical that I could preach the green brown woods to all the juiceless world, descending from this divine wilderness like a John the Baptist, eating Douglas squirrels and wild honey or wild anything, crying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Sequoia is at hand! And, following a high-Sierra windstorm, during which he had ridden joyfully back and forth in the top of a 100-foot-high Douglas spruce, he tells of "the coundess hosts of the forests hushed and tranquil, tower ing above one another on the slopes of the hills like a devout audience. The setting sun filled them with amber light, and seemed to say, while 385</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review they listened, 'My peace I give unto you.' " Leopold, Eiseley, and Dillard continue to find the concepts and language of the Judaeo Christjan tradition useful for understanding and conveying nature's meaning; Snyder finds his framework in Native American beliefs and in Zen Buddhism, while Abbey distrusts all religious doctrines. All, regardless of specific theologies, share Muir's experience of the wilder ness as holy. Muir is able, on the trail's other side, to attribute spirit to nature without falling up the idealist chute. His secret is a reversion to the pre-Pythagorean Greeks, to a world of gods who both inhabited natural objects and were expressed by them. In another famous chapter from The Mountains of California, Muir describes the water ouzel, his favorite bird. It lives in the tumult of Yosemite's waterfalls and rapids, flying and swimming through the turbulence and laying its eggs ("white like foam bubbles," Muir says) in crannies of the rock backing the falls. Muir describes this cheerful creature, which he comes upon in some of his wildest adventures, as "my little comforter," but rather than disembodying it in his veneration, he attaches it the more closely to its natural place : Ouzels seem so completely part and parcel of the streams they inhabit, they scarce suggest any other origin than the streams themselves; and one might be almost pardoned in fancying they come direct from the living waters, like flowers from the ground. John Muir's writing is a sturdy affirmation of the earth, as well as a record detailing its beauty. His books coalesce in a single vision of nature's wholeness, a transforming perception to which he was helped by his own experience of wilderness, and to which he tried to lead the rest of the nation. Muir's sermon is "only connect": he wants to bring individuals into closer harmony with nature, to point out to them the huge, beautifully balanced cycles within which all phenomena take part, and, eventually, to share his understanding that the panorama of wilderness is the substance, as well as the demonstration, of divine truth. He asserts, with Whitehead, that God "is not before all crea tion, but with all creation." This is why Muir cares so much that we "Climb the mountains and get their good tidings," why he insists that "Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into the trees." 386</page></plain_text>
