<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETTY DASHEW ROBINS AND ROBERT F. BUSSABARGER FOLK IMAGES OF SANJHI DEVI The images of the Indian goddess, Sanjhi, a gramadevata (village deity), are popular art forms. After many generations have formed their versions of Sanjhi her annual portrayal remains naively straightforward, intrinsically powerful, and sensuously designed. These dei (folk style), images are also excellent sources of cultural, social, and religious insights for the interpretation of village life even where it has become a part of urban areas. Sanjhi images can be found in the villages and cities of Rajasthan, Punjab, Hariana, and Uttar Pradesh. Examples illustrated and discussed in the following remarks are from Juliano village (near Delhi), Rampura village (Delhi), Gurgaon village, Hariana, Kinari (tinsel) bazaar, Chandhi Chowk (Old Delhi) and in Rajgarh village, Rajasthan. Sanjhi's rural wall image is redesigned as a paper collage (discussed below) when the image makers move to an urban setting. Although the village tradition is retained, distinct changes occur in the design that reflect the urban way of life. As S. K. Ray has written, "the living tradition of a small object, an earthen vase ... an alpona drawing from a woman's hand vertically connects men of the past with men of the present..."z "The living tradition of folk art in India furnishes important documents augmented by social and political impacts."3 Village women make Sanjhi, to whom the young unmarried girls pray to obtain a good husband, many children, and prosperity; her image is an inseparable part of the bratas4 (cere- monies in which only women participate to make vows). The making of the deli image has sur- vived the extensive image production of mirgas (the sophisticated "great tradition" art). Loss of patronage of the mdrga productions made it necessary for the professional artisans who were men to change to other means of employment, but the dei types made by women have con- tinued independent of economic changes. Sanjhi Devi is one of the many mother goddess forms worshipped throughout India. The belief in the female principle as the Goddess, is a major religious emphasis; its origins are found in obscure local cults and indigenous tribal elements. The goddess concept from pre-Aryan times became an integral part of the highly developed traditions of the Vedas, Purdnas, and Tantras which have a continuing influence on current beliefs. T.A.G. Rao in discussing Devi IAnanda K.Coomaraswamy, Christian and Oriental Philosophy of Art, Dover, New York, 1956, p. 130. 2 Ray, S.K., Folk Art of India, Vagalyam, Calcutta, 1967, P. 13. 3 Ray, S.K., The Brata Art of Bengal, K. L.Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta, 1961, p. 16. 4 Ray, p. 13. The authors are using S. K. Ray's definition of brata. Ray makes the distinction between the words brata and puja. He defines bratas as household or domestic worship by women only; puja, "temple worship of a single religion of magical origins" which is performed by men. s Coomaraswamy, p. 130. 295</page><page sequence="2">suggests that "... a student ... cannot fail to see in the very numerousness and variety of these goddesses a striking proof of the gradual affiliation of non-Aryan deities of all sorts to the institutions of 'expanding Hinduism.'"6 The Sanjhi image originates from these non-Aryan primitive cults whose believers endow the Goddess with the appropriate powers emphasizing her beneficent nature toward procreation and the fullness of life. When her devotees are ab- sorbed into Hinduism she becomes incorporated into the Hindu pantheon as one of its god- desses while retaining her traditional significance, form, and use in religious7 ritual. However, affiliation of Sanjhi with other non-Aryan goddesses is also an essential aspect of her attributes. Stella Kramrisch describes Sanjhi, "as a form of the Great Goddess Hoi, and the ceremonies as the celebration of the sacraments of the cosmos. The image of the goddess Hoi, whose body is the square diagram of the cosmos, is assimilated to the shape of man by adding to the square a head and the extremities, or also to that of a house in which man has his dwelling or to both at the same time... When, however, the Great Goddess as Sanjhi is made to dwell in her image, her shape is a composition of triangles entirely covered with multi-form and starshaped clay discs."8 The seven sisters, mothers, or virgins who are affiliated with Sanjhi and whose local and regional names and enumerations vary (6, 7, 8, 9, Io, 16) are non-Aryan grama devatis, but more lately have come to be regarded as wives or sisters of Siva and as the consorts of Brahmd and Visnu. Combined, their attributes are identical to Sakti (female energy). Their relation to Sanjhi within the Goddess principle is evident by the cross-references of her common attributes, i.e., K;irttikeyi (May~iri)- Kaumdri; Sarasvati - Vdc - Brahmani - Sandhyd; Pdrvati - Indrini - Camundd; Laksmi - Vaisnavi - VarIhi; or the Pleiades (Krttiklis), the six nurses of KIrttikeya. They are benevolent in nature and have the power to ward off evil and disease, and they are worshipped to assure well being through birth and marriage. Nevertheless, at the same time they possess demonic powers and are the messengers of death. Sanskrit origins of the name Sanjhi relates the goddess to evening or twilight. Sandhya is the goddess of twilight (especially evening), goddess of the juncture of light and darkness who is the daughter of Brahmi (referred to as Sarasvati as well as the wife of Siva).9 The popular Hindi name for evening is sanjha. 6 Rao, T.A.G., Elements of Hindu Iconography, Paragon Reprint Book Corp., 1968 (1914 Madras Edition) Vol. 12, Part II, P. 399. 7 Oscar Lewis elaborates about Sanjhi and the Niortha or Naurtha Festival in Rampura village, Delhi State, in his Village Life in Northern India, Vintage Books, 1965, p.21 5-6, 234, 235,238, 239. Also in Village India, edited by McKim Marriott, 1969, University of Chicago Press, in his Little Communities in an Indigenous Civilization, p. 192, 200, 202, 215, he discusses the Naurtha or Nau Durgas (Nine Durgas) Festival in the village of Kishan Garhi, U.P.Although Sanjhi is not named in the latter, both authors connect her or her type with this festival. Also the distinction between the "little and great traditions" are developed. 8 Kramrisch, Stella, Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, 1968, p. 70. Her description of the rectangularly shaped goddess Hoi resembles the Oppi Untracht photograph in Craft Horizons, July, August, 1959, p. 14. The worship of Hoi is ascribed to women with children by Oscar Lewis, pp.219-22I. 9 Oppi Untracht; the two photographs illustrate images made for a celebration called "Sandhia" (sandbyd, evening rites) for marriageable girls in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The worship is ascribed to Saraswati (epithet of Brahmani, one of the seven mothers), and it occurs in the fall (same as Sanjhi) for 15 days. The triple hymn to the Sun (morning-noon-evening) is Vac (goddess of speech) and called Saraswati at sunset. As the goddess of the arts, Saraswati's vehicle is a peacock (sikhivahana) which connects her to the dance. During the three circular motions by the bridal couple around the sacred fire (wedding dance) prior to the Saptapadi (7 steps) to the northeast they chant prayers to Saraswati (Padraskara-Gribya- Sfitra, Kandika 7, 8). Also, Mayura-Vara-Vahini who rides a peacock mentioned in the Durgd Saptasati is a Durgd form of 296</page><page sequence="3">According to one informantio she becomes synonymous with Pirvati. After her long and austere devotion (tapasya) Siva made her his consort and granted all her wishes as a reward; hence Pirvati's linkage with Sanjhi who has the power to satisfy marital aspirations of young girls. Also, Sanjhi's connection to Laksmi, goddess of good fortune is implied by her power to bestow well being. Two mediums are used to make the images of Sanjhi (see illustrations). One, which is the older indigenous form, is essentially clay, paper, tinsel, shells and cloth ornaments stuck onto cowdung which has been plastered on walls; two, colored paper collages and drawings. The former remains relatively unchanged whereas the latter has incorporated new motifs. The ex- posure to different art forms and materials that were present and available in towns and villages has stimulated the portrayal and construction of the Sanjhi image in watercolor on walls and as paper collages which are then sold in bazaars prior to and during the Sanjhi brata or ritual festivities.v Brightly colored cutouts are pasted on white paper, and border is usually decorated with gold, silver, blue green, yellow, black and red metallic glitter paper. The collage depicts a convincingly direct, yet primitively stylized image of Sanjhi who is surrounded by both past and present symbols of the good life. Traditional symbols of pros- perity such as the camel, the bullock cart, and the palanquin are juxtaposed with modern sym- bols such as the naively depicted airplane and train. The meaning of the new symbols takes on those of the older traditions. The melding of a primitive religious deity with Hinduism, as well as the accommodation of Hinduism to modern life, are thus exemplified. In the Delhi area Sanjhi Devi's brata commences on the first day of Ashwin (September- October) and continues for a total of nine days.'z The Dassahra Pajd, which celebrates Rima's victory over Rivana, immediately follows the last day of Sanjhi Devi's brata. The Sanjhi celebration in Jaipur, Rajasthan is very elaborate. During the nine days of the nine Durgis festival with its fair are featured competitions such as camel races, archery, wrestling, sword fighting, folk dancing, and singing. Saraswatl. Because both she and Sanjhi are connected with the peacock and have the rectangular aspects of Hoi, we conclude that all three may be worshipped interchangeably. See Kramrisch, Plate XXVIII, for an additional Sanjhi illustration. 10 P.D. Sharma is our informant. He is originally from Rohtak, and now resides in Delhi. He, with the photographer Avinash Pasricha, took some of the pictures illustrated in the article. " The many ritual art forms or ideographic diagrams made by women similar to Sanjhi are referred to by different names in various parts of India. They are made on inside and outside walls, floors, doorways, courtyards and verandas of homes. Many are formed by flower paste drawn on a mud surface, painted colors on whitewash, mud and dung con- structions faced with mirrors, terracotta shapes, shells, etc., and others are drawn or painted on portable surfaces such as paper sheets. Examples by name or location and description include: i. Alponas, typical of Bengal. 2. Lakshmi house drawings, Pipili, Puri, Orissa. 3. Rangolis of northern India and Maharastra. 4. Saurashtran relief mud and mirrored walls. 5. Madubani paintings, Mitila, Bihar. 6. NVaurtha images such as Sanjhi; Hoi in north central India. 7. Saora tribal pictures, Orissan interior (made by both boys and girls). 8. Mandana in Rajasthan. 9. Sathiya in Gujerat. Io. Kolum and mugga in southern India. I1. Cowka purna and sona rakhna in Uttar Pradesh. 12 Lewis, pp. 215-6. 297</page><page sequence="4">Brata "signified a solemn or sacred purpose... which is pursued as a joyous rhythmic ritual simultaneously through an integrated employment of thought, work, and physical move- ment".13 Like all such ceremonies, the Sanjhi Devi brata comprises three elements. Tagore describes them as: "First the desire, then the art (alpona), next the spell (chhada) and in the end the story (kathd)".* S. K. Ray sums up the meaning of the brata, "brata, originally a crude witch- craft, gradually developed into a system of worship through art. Spells become poetry, and magical alpona became art. The spells are the 'lyric cry of the soul' and the alpona are the re- flection of delicate desires of the mind of our women folk."15 We have already mentioned the desires which Sanjhi is importuned to fulfill, namely, the wish to be blessed with a good marriage. At the start of the brata, the unmarried girls organize into groups which perform the rites together. The traditional Sanjhi image (the alponayantra diagram element), alone or with her sister Dhoonda, her brotherI6 and children (her relatives in a broad sense) is executed by the participants on the outer walls of houses or on the compound walls. A base of mud and cowdung is decorated with clay discs (implying mandalas or yoga body energy centers), bits of cloth and cowrie shells. The eyes are indicated by shells; hair by black charcoal or paint; teeth by the color white; dress by red, yellow, and green. The girls break their daily fast with an evening meal at one of the homes of their relatives who take turns in assuming the task of food preparation. The best meals possible are prepared so that the girls will be strong and healthy for marriage. On the last day of the brata, the image of Sanjhi is scraped off the walls, and the materials are placed into a pitcher. The girls, in procession and singing and chanting prayers (the chhada element) carry the dung-filled pitcher to the banks of a river or pond. There, they place a lighted lamp in the pitcher and float it on the water. As the pitcher floats away, the girls tearfully sing songs of adulation to Sanjhi. The brata ends with a feast of the food each of the girls has brought to the river banks, and perhaps a recapitulation of the ceremony (kathd element). The creation of the Sanjhi images made possible by the continuance of her ritual worship in both village and urban settings has not been eclipsed by the passage of time or social and economic change. Nevertheless, the rapid encroachment of technological growth threatens the unselfconscious insulated life that has fostered and preserved the primitive energy of the images of Sanjhi. Therefore, concern for the worth of the Sanjhi images as artistic forms and cultural documents is greatly to be encouraged. DISCUSSION OF ILLUSTRATIONS Plate I Sanjhi's hands are always in the abhaya mudrd or gesture of assurance. Her body, highly stylized and intuitively exaggerated, is reminiscent of paleolithic images of mother goddesses. Sacred 1a Ray, Bratas of Bengal, p. Ii, quoted from Dutt, G. S., The Bratachari Synthesis, Calcutta, 1940. 24 Ray, Bratas of Bengal, p. II, transl. by Ray from Banglar Brata, 1947, P- 70. 1s Ray, Bratas of Bengal, p. 48. 16 Lewis, p.216, Kramrisch, p.70o. 298</page><page sequence="5">diagrams, yantras17 (pictorial instruments for representation of the essence of divine beings) appear as centered rosettes or star-shaped terracotta discs which act as mandala body energy centers, a motif associated with kundalini sakti8, a tantra yoga concept. Large-sized discs are the most auspicious concentrations of jakti (energy). The rings on the arms, hands, and legs are bangles and ankle bracelets given to the bride. The women who make Sanjhi images and participate in her brata may not necessarily be aware of implicit meanings found in their creations which are identified with the "great tra- ditions." Our interpretations are related to the evolution of these traditions which have trace- able origins in the more intuited "little traditions" to which Sanjhi is normally assigned. Her face is covered by a red curtain (purdah) a traditional custom observed and a color used for wedding saris. The head has a protruding stylized peacock feather which is identical to the "tope" motif of the seven figures seen on one of the Mohenjo-Daro clay seals. Dung has been temporarily stuck to the brick wall of the house to serve as a base for the whole figure. Later it is removed and replaced with whitewash as a part of the Naurathaig cere- monies for the young girls of neighboring families of the same social status. Plate II Sanjhi, the center figure, is accompanied by Dhoonda, her sister (left), and her brother, or friend, and four symbols of friends (upper left; two not in photograph). Sometimes similar marks designate the number of children in the family. They also have the appearance of charan (feet) and are possibly the feet of Laksmi. The figure on the right hand corner is Sanjhi's brother who brings offerings on the eighth evening of Nauratha. Sanjhi and Dhoonda are in purdah, and, when they are fed (nivedya offering),zo the curtain is lifted. (Sanjhi's curtain was lifted by P.D. Sharma for the photograph.) Bodies of the figures are triangular and similar to those of the small figures in the painted drawing (illustration VII) from the Kinari bazaar, but appendages are more literally formed in contrast to the Juliano image. Sanjhi's yellow bid and cowrie shell necklaces are also different features. The yellow (haldi) is made from the turmeric plant for an auspicious color applied to the bodies of wedding couples.2 This color is associated with the stories about Sitd and Gauri (the "light" or brilliant) and in relation to Sitald (smallpox goddess), for prevention of disease.2 The terracotta star shapes against the dark (night) dung background are common to all the illustrated wall images. 17 Alain Danielou, Hindu Polytheism, Routledge and Kegan, London, 1963, P.351-61. s8 Danielou, p. 286. 19 Lewis, pp. 199, 215-I7, 234-7, 24I, 243, 245, Marriott, pp. 192, 20zoI, 202, 211, 21, Fig.3. 20 Thomas, P., Hindu Customs and Manners, Taraporevella Sons, Bombay, ig96o, p.28.

Her hands, typical of the other illus- trated wall motifs, are made (not necessarily intentionally) like a conch shell (Sankha) shapes. Conch shells are wind instruments used to make sounds during the sandhyas and are also cut into bracelets.'3 Closely viewed, the star-like mandalas generally have an open (peacock feather eye) center with painted spots implying a square, the cosmic universe. In Kramrisch's wall image illustration, Sanjhi's upper body (with the same mandalas) is rimmed by peacocks in full form. The chest design may be taken as moon, sun and stars diagram which also appear in the bazaar drawing. Her amulet is a magical ornament commonly worn which wards off evil spirits and sometimes contains herbs, metals, or stones beneficial to the body. This kind of multiple inter- change of literal and symbolic meanings derived from a basic visual shape is typical of forms used in Indian art. Related expanded meanings by both observer and maker or user are possible. Plate IV A village woman in a colorful sari forms the peacock of the Sanjhi wall image design. Below the main figure is the goddess Nauratha (goddess of the nine nights) with a variety of names, "Siva Sankar", Sitd, and Bari Devi (big goddess). Her image and symbols are almost identical to Sanjhi. By example the design is passed on to her daughters. Plate V This Sanjhi collage, a much older version than others shown, has a commandingly strong sense of design. Although it uses essentially the same elements, some are not included in the illustrated later versions. Couples who apparently are dancing together inside Sanjhi's house-body as well as outside are probably a wedding pair. They may also be Krsna dancing with a Gopi (cow- maid), Krsna with Radhd, or Rdma and Sitd rejoicing in reunion helped by Hanuman, who tell the story of divine and human love. The rat (or mouse), Musika, (as interpreted), the vehicle for Gane'a (household god and remover of obstacles) and the bull, Nandi. (Vehicle of the great god Siva) under Sanjhi's feet expand the context of her affinity to other deities. The bottom area emphasizes both traditional and new means of transportation to carry on commerce and ceremonies; the horse, camel, elephant, bullock cart, and train. An auspicious four-quartered flowered cross represents the universe with a gold square center as the earth as well as the sacred crossroads?4; it is balanced on the right side by a Siva linga temple. All of these figure in a young girl's aspirations to please Sanjhi who may grant her a full and rewarding life. 3 Chatterji, Tapan Mohan, Alpona, Orient Longman Ltd., Calcutta, I965, p.35. 24 Marriot, p. 204. 300</page><page sequence="7">Plate I Sanjhi Devi Image, about 40" high.

Resulting configurations become purposefully exaggerated and geometric and describe the maker's inner ideas. The synthesis of Sanjhi's anthropomorphic rectangular (with a triangular "roof" head) house-body (quaternary form) and the literal objects and figures surrounding her heighten the iconic effect of the design. The multi-colored objects against a white paper ground which parallels that of the Sanjhi on walls. By her right hand she has a mirror (symbolizing the reflection of the goddess) and fan (denoting respect) for her personal comfort. In the upper right hand corner Hanuman leaps s through the sky which announces his role in the coming Dassahra. Over Sanjhi's head an air- plane suggests the swiftness of his or anyone's journey to conquer evil. Double peacocks and other birds above Sanjhi are universally used motifs and add meanings such as the male and female aspects of life (love birds).26 The peacock is always auspicious and a sign of importance and immortality. In its role as Karttikeya's vehicle it acts as killer of serpents or Time. Female devotees, one, hands clasped in reverence, and the other a dancer, flank Sanjhi. A well or a lota (water vessel) head load signify the role of water as a vital element to life. Human suffering is warded off by the scorpion (rTcika) seen under the mirror; the palanquin adds status and comfort, especially as a wedding ceremony conveyance; a garden or forests with trees (possibly including a tulsi bush27 for the vastra offering),28 flowers, elephants, tiger and birds exemplify the extension of Sanjhi's effect on life. The "X-ray" schema of the house or womb repeats within Sanjhi the form of young girls of the house. Rectangularity, a feature of the whole collage, may imply the four-quartered aspect of the world. It is rimmed by a flame design which suggests the path of an arati lamp or as on the saras of Bengal,29 the edges of a tank or lake with waves. Plate VII In the red monochrome painted drawing Sanjhi does not basically differ from her collage image. As a diagrammatic drawing it closely resembles alponas and rangolis. The bilateral form over the head appears to be a torana (arch) commonly found in temples and over images, compared to its use in the other collages it is exaggerated in size. An embroidered household torana (re- presenting strips of Mangoro or Ashoka tree leaves) drawn above the other one exemplifies auspicious decorations for marriage ceremonies. Visnu's face is quaintly depicted as the sun 2s Danielou, pp. I73-4. 26 Cirlot, J.E., A Dictionary of Symbols, Philosophical Library, N.Y., I962, p. 239. Peacocks symmetrically disposed on either side of the cosmic tree (Persia) denote the psychic duality of man (related to the myth of the Gemini) drawing its life-force from the principle unity; also (Hindu), the pattern of its wings resemble eyes, are taken to represent the starry firmament. They also correspond to dusk, Also, Verrier, Elwin, The Tribal Art oflIndia, Oxford U. Press, London, I951, pp.15I1-6. 27 Gupta, S.

The new moon day, amavasya, (living with the sun) connects Sanjhi's aspects with the astrology and cosmology of night and day. The triangular "star" cluster, resting inside the crescent moon may have the following interpretations: A triangular diagram representing the Seven Mdtrkds (mothers)31 also called (the Pleiades) is found in areas where Sanjhi is worshipped. One type of triangular diagram is constructed with seven directions of space, three with double directions and the center a3 groups. Also the ascending triangle33 (Siva's sign) is synonymous with the Pleiades who are in the constellation Vrshabha (bull or Taurus, the vehicle of Siva). On the beginning of the night of the seventh lunar month when Sanjhi's worship takes place the sun, new moon, and the Pleiades appear auspiciously together as "living with the sun." The Krittikds (the six Pleiades) are the nurses of the peacock rider KIrttikeya, god of war, (Siva's virile son). A dweller of the higher spheres of the fiery sun, Kdrttikeya is symbolized by Sanjhi's starry peacock crown. In a story by Kishan Garhi women, a light was held behind a sieve to imitate the new moon.34 The tdrd-brata5 worship of the planets as Sfirya (Sun), Candra (moon) and Tarr (stars) and sometimes related to the Pleiades constellation is connected with Bengal alpona designs. Perhaps this worship by women desiring progeny parallels or relates to the Sanjhi drawing. Sanjhi's arms, legs, and rectangular house body delineations with triangles represent the body energy centers as seen in the clay discs of the wall images. The male principle is an upward triangle: fire, the female is down (water and energy) and the point is bindu (limit of manifesta- tion). Diamond and triangular figures (arms raised in assurance) inside may be interpreted as Sanjhi in the form of young girls. Figures in the top row are not clearly defined but may de- scribe the aspiration for a family including boys. Although Sanjhi has two arms in other ex- amples, the four here represent a common motif for many Indian deities to describe the multi- plicity of their powers. The usual comforts and toiletries for the goddess, the fan, mirror and comb, are at her sides. The cow, a sign of plenty, and the bull representing virility are incorporated at the bottom. The two girls in the corner are worshipping Sanjhi. 31 Danielou, p. 287; Kramrisch, p. 57; Wilber T.Elmore, Dravidian Gods in Modern Hinduism, U. of Nebraska, 1913, pp. 18-30; W.Crooke, Popular Religions and Folk Lore of Northern India, M.Manharlal, Delhi, reprint 1968, Vol.1, pp. I I I-I 12; Monier-Williams, Brahmanism and Hinduism, McMillan, N.Y., 1891, pp. I88, 213, 222-229; H.Whitehead, The Village Gods of South India, Oxford U., London, 1916, pp. 24, 27, 36. a2 Cirlot, p. 269. 3a Cirlot, p. 318. 34 Marriot, p. 204 and figure 2. as Chatterji, pp. 33, 45, 50, 58, 59, 61, 62. 306</page></plain_text>
