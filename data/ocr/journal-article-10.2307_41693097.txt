The contribution of the West towards formulating a theory of aesthetics and developing it into a philosophy of its own is recognised beyond doubt. Hard and sustained work done in the field of Arts, Architecture, Philosophy, Religion and Literature would reveal that Indians not only did also know much about beauty and aesthetics, it was deeply rooted in their culture. Mrs. Padma Sudbi, in her present work, investigates the entire gamut of the aesthetic theories of India and she deserves our thanks for taking up the challenge. Her concern in her doctoral thesis, of which this monograph constitutes one part only, has been to systematically arrange and understand the Indian aesthetic theories in Sanskrit literature mainly beginning from Vedic literature to the age of KãlidSsa. For this she goes into the history of different Indian concepts of beauty, arranges them in chronological order, compares them with concepts in the West and, above all, discusses and analyses them so as to reach a conclusion which could help us in understanding the subtleties of the theory of Indian aesthetics. Dr. ( Mrs. ) Sudhi chooses to follow the definition of aesthetics as given in the Encyclopaedia Britannica to encounter the wider range of aesthetics and tries to study the whole problem from the ethical, religious, social, philosof phical and political view-point. Her efforts have been to acquaint hersei- with various aspects of theology, religion and arts and provide us with cate- gories of Sanskrit literature in the different schools of aesthetics. She prefers to only casually refer to the theory of Rasa and Abhinavagupta, the much talked about, and discusses the problem of art from angles referred to above. She also refers to Western authors only to find correspondence in Western aesthetics. Padma Sudhi divides her monograph into five chapters containing two to three sub-sections each. The contents of her thesis are supported by a number of plates and sketches of which she has given the details in her mono- graph. The Prologue includes the introduction to the topic and the scope of the subject, a brief history of Indian aesthetics, contributions, treatment of the subject and her limitations together with some remarks at the end. The list of abbreviations, the bibliography and the word-index, all make the mono- graph scientific and presentable. The first chapter, with its three sub-sections, introduces the reader with t|ie limits of the study of aesthetics and helps to deduce the essentials of</page><page sequence="2">340 Annaìs BORI , LXIV ( 1983 ) beauty of Indian aesthetics in general. Dr. ( Mrs. ) Sudhi starts with the etymology of the word 4 Sundara % turns to the comparative study of aesthetic attitudes of the East and the West and then discusses the theories propounded by poeticians and philosophers. This she does using all the terminology of the ancients. In sub-sections II and III she deals with Indian view-point, both philosophically and as understood in Art, regarding Kala and the art of music, painting and sculpture and explains beauty as physical, mental, spiritual* ethical and also metaphysical. Starting right from the Vedas, Dr. ( Mrs. ) Sudhi moves upto the Sutras, covering the Brãhmanas, the Aranyakas and the Upanisads in between, in the II chapter. Beginning from polytheism of the Vedic culture she covers the whole range of anthropomorphism, henotheism and pantheism and finishes with monotheism, the culmination point of Vedic thought. Having discussed the role of Usas, Agni, Soma, Rudra, Sürya, Aditi and Purusa during the later period and of sacrifice during the Brãhmana period in the I section of the chap- ter, she turns towards the study of the optimistic aesthetic concepts of Vedas which culminated into philosophical culture of the Upanisads. In her effort to reach the concept of harmony she discusses here the metaphysical aesthetic experiences and wide perspectives of rationalization and humanism and supernal attitudes. Sukrti, Samrddhi and Siddhi of the Upanisads, accord- ing to her, are the target upon which are founded the aesthetic theories of that period. The last section of the chapter is devoted to the study of the philosophy of Bhoga and Yoga as understood by the Sütras. Chapter IU deals with Purãnic literature which places beauty in synthesis of Societies, Cultures, Religions and Philosophies. It pertains to the study of the moral good of ethiqs, knowledge and spiritual advancement of philosophy, the truth of epistemology, love in fine arts and its culmination into the concept of devotion. Whereas in the I section the attempt has been to find out the scattered concepts of beauty and their social perspectives, their reaction to the tradition, new ideas, new images, new talents, theory of love with reference to philosophies of Vaiçnavism, Šaivism and Šaktism, the cosmic-play, theory of yoga, Ardhanarišvara, the psychological analysis of the symbols of aesthetic achievements and the Surrealism of the Purãças attract the attention of the reader in the II Section. Section III deals with the psychological bearings of Agni Furano on aesthetic taste. Chapters IV and V have only two sections each. Placing Rãmãyapa and Mahãbhãrata in their chronological order in these two chapters separately Dr. Sudhi asserts that contrary to the bourgeoise society of Mahãbhãrata Râmâyana's idealism favours the socialistic society and challenges even fhç</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 341 divine law of spiritual values. She discusses at length the word ' Sundara * and its various applications in the Sundara-Kãnda of the Rãmãyana and compares Rãmãyana with Yoga-Vãsistha and Adhyãtma Rãmãyana also. With this wide perspective in view, Dr. Sudhi aptly points out to the progressive value of aesthetics. Underlining the importance ef extreme atten- tion or concentration required for the enjoyment of beauty, she suggests that aesthetics, according to Indian view-point, may be called as " Saundarya- Yoga " in India. This scholarly work thus provides the reader with ample new inform- ation, and gives enough evidence of being original and interpretative. The introduction of the new material, undoubetly, has affected the compactness of the work, but it has its own utility as well for those not very well acquainted with Sanskrit writings.
