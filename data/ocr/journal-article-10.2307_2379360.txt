Professor Topitsch, of the University of Vienna, along with Professors V. Kraft and B. von Juhos, constitute what must be one of the rarest of philosophical species, that of Viennese Positivists in Vienna. In this book the author continues, quite in the spirit of the Wiener Kreis, to explore and expose the col- lection of Scheinprobleme (pseudo-problems), ethical, epistemological, and social, which to the positivist collectively make up metaphysics. Unlike most other Viennese Positivists, Topitsch comes to philosophy, not from math- ematics or physics, but from sociology. He stands in the line of Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and Hans Kelsen; but finds in his predecessors, even in the "heroic positivism" of Weber, too much "pathos," too much senti- mental regard for man's understandable, but ultimately useless and even dangerous, attempt to make himself at home in an unfriendly cosmos with nothing between him and his en- emies but a bag of empty tautologies and out- right contradictions. The convulsions of the present-like the crisis of the city-state in Plato's time-demand an "intellectual asceti- cism" strong enough to break away once and for all from world views which are empty of content and which at bottom rest on forcing subjective and local values onto the objective universe. The author is probably not so naive as to suppose that the disappearance of meta- physics will lead at once to the progress that some enthusiasts have preached. Self-deception springs from deeper needs than philosophy. But it might at least be hoped that a theoreti-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 225 cal resolution of metaphysical Scheinprobleme could serve as a necessary, if unfortunately not a sufficient, condition for a final victory over the obscurantists who so excessively an- noy Professor Topitsch and, indeed, all good positivists. The basic thesis of the book is that all the categories of European philosophy represent a progressive abstraction and emptying of con- tent of those primitive, concrete, and cosmic ideas which we call "myth." Myth, in turn, was an anthropomorphic projection on a uni- versal scale of "concrete valuational assump- tions concerning the consequences of human social and ethical transactions." The purpose of this sociocosmic myth-making was, first, to explain and, second, to predict the conse- quences of human actions. Soon, however, the local and personal details of the myth were to such a degree removed that when the pro- jected picture was reflected back onto men, they were no longer able to recognize the provenance of their own ideas, which now ap- peared to them as absolutes. Human society, arts, and primitive techniques were all ex- ploited in this process of analogy to yield what Topitsch calls "intentional models of the cosmos." In these models (termed by the author sociomorphic and technomorphic, re- spectively) the universe appears as a social play of familiar roles derived from purposive willing and action and thoroughly charged with value. Indispensable to poetry, they are useless for philosophy, which, nevertheless, can set itself no other task than to ruminate them endlessly. Now such a thesis as to the origin of meta- physical categories is not completely new, but it is presented in this book with such a wealth of example and scholarly learning that the reader (at least, this one) feels that it be- comes more and more a solidly documented fact and less and less a mere speculation. The author is able to do this because of his famil- iarity with a large body of very recent Euro- pean research, most of which, it should be noted, is unknown to American philosophers, partly, one feels, because of language barriers, but partly, one fears, because of a lack of in- terest in a kind of philosophizing which does not fall readily into the classifications already become traditional in the English-speaking world. It might perhaps be described as the "Philological Philosophizing" of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Spengler, and others. Professor Topitsch traces the development of the Eastern and the Hellenic myths in de- tail up to the beginning of the second cen- tury B.C., at which time they had become that philosophical koine (to use a felicitous expres- sion of Festugiere) which has since exercised, under the influence of Christian dogma and neo-Platonism, a decisive influence on Euro- pean philosophy. Originally pragmatic and empirical, the koine was attenuated first into a moralistic or contemplative metaphysics which transfigured the world because it could no longer explain it. With increasing attenua- tion in modern times, it has issued more and more in a set of empty formulas which are no longer in principle confrontable with any pos- sible fact. (In ethics these two stages pro- duced, respectively, hypothetical imperatives and absolute or categorical imperatives.) Metaphysics becomes at last a bloodless set of disembodied values, while the natural sci- ences, renouncing any possible connection with values or metaphysical concepts, make more and more successful predictions of fact. The task remaining to the positivist philos- opher is apparently to exhibit these historical processes in such a perspicuous schematism that the unprejudiced mind will renounce once and for all the pseudo-problems and meaningless solutions of metaphysics. This last metaphysics-free stage had in any case become a clear logical necessity after Kant and his successors had shown that certain nu- clear sentences of the traditional theology and metaphysics were theoretically unprovable and were grounded, if at all, in practice and valua- tion. But logical necessity and psychological necessity have no necessary connection and even tough-minded, positivistic persons, as, for example, Durkheim, could not take the last step of identifying metaphysical catego- ries with pure metaphors (although Durkheim had previously interpreted sociologically the whole structure of metaphysics and even of formal logic.) The objection is bound to be raised against this book that it commits the genetic fallacy; that a chronological account of metaphysical categories can no more rob them of their epis- temological status than a genetical account of mathematics could prove mathematics to be a branch of physics. Such an objection would be beside the point, however. It is quite in order to offer for metaphysical concepts a genetic account of their status if they have no other. And that they have no other status is true, at least, for the positivist, who cannot</page><page sequence="3">226 ETHICS imagine any criterion of meaning which could be used to make metaphysical statements meaningful. And, although Professor Topitsch is not at any pains to discuss which version of the positivist criterion of meaning he is using, it is quite clear that this criterion, whatever it is, is not itself to be regarded as one of the discredited statements of metaphysics but an open invitation, never accepted, for the meta- physician to say what he means, if, in fact, he means anything. This book is most warmly recommended to all positivistically tinctured persons who would gladly exchange, at least for a while, Anglo-American precision for European in- sight. As is unfortunately true of many other- wise estimable German productions, there is very inadequate indexing. JOHN WILKINSON University of California at Santa Barbara</page></plain_text>
