<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dimitri N. Breschinsky Flights of Fancy: Birds in the Works of Loren Eiseley Rectitude of the heart lends to the mind its true value. Without it an intelligent man is a monster. -Denis Fonvizin, 18th-century Russian playwright Wild geese , not angels , are the images of humanity's own highest self. They show us the apogee of our own poten- tial. They live by the same principles that we, too often, only espouse. They embody liberty ; grace, and devotion, combining those three contradictory virtues with a seam- less elegance that leaves us shamed and inspired. When they pass overhead, honking so musically, we are treated to (and accused by) a glimpse of the same sort of sublime creaturehood that we want badly to see in ourselves. -David Quammen, 20th-century American nature writer 1. Of Birds and Men In his provocative essay-cum-short story "The Judgment of the Birds/'1 Loren Eiseley- or, better, his professorial persona- finds himself on "the twentieth floor of a midtown hotel" ( Immense Journey 16 5)2 looking down in the dim light of early morning upon an unfamiliar cityscape: New York being taken over by birds. The birds are pigeons whose Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 15.1 (Winter 2008) Copyright © 2008 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">40 ISLE flashing wings seem to concentrate the gathering light, making "the outlines" of the lofts "more distinct," and who, in utter silence, were beginning to float outward upon the city. In and out through the open slits in the cupolas passed the white-winged birds on their mysterious errands. At this hour the city was theirs, and quietly, without brushing a single wing tip against stone in that high, eerie place, they were taking over the spires of Manhattan. They were pouring upward in a light that was not yet perceptible to human eyes, while far down in the black darkness of the alleys it was still midnight. (165-66) It is a breathtaking sight- so exhilarating, in fact, that the still somno- lent narrator, who is precariously perched on the "broad old-fashioned window sill" (165) of his hotel room, feels a primordial urge to join in the revelry. The muscles of his hands begin to twitch, "making little premonitory lunges" (166). He wants "to enter that city [of light] and go away over the roofs in the first dawn." Of course that would be suicidal, so, reluctantly, he draws back and returns to his "own kind" (167). But the impulse is still there: to merge with the birds, to become one with them. What is there about birds that would make the narrator, a natural- ist and explorer bearing a distinct resemblance to the author, want to shed his human identity and fly off with them? Eiseley's short stories and essays brim with birds, common ones mostly. There are song spar- rows and sparrow hawks, crows and ravens, warblers and pigeons, gulls, owls, ducks, and meadowlarks- the list could be considerably expanded. There is also the generic bird, to which Eiseley appeals on more than one occasion. Why so many avian species, named and un- named, in his works and what role do they play? More importantly, what insight do they provide into his art and philosophy? That is the subject of the present inquiry. It should be said at the outset that Eiseley's works, as those of other twentieth-century literary naturalists, such as Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Annie Dillard, and Barry Lopez, feature many other creatures besides birds. Used for a variety of literary and extraliterary purposes or mentioned only in passing, his menagerie includes foxes and hares, rats and muskrats, catfish and star fish, turtles and snakes, a pike straight out of Waiden Pond, and even the occasional insect- brown wasps,3 for example, who fall from their paper nests with the approach of winter, and sphex wasps, who, in preying on cicadas, raise disturbing ques- tions about evolution. A spider that attempts to live on in a street lamp (a "minor sun") despite the onset of winter is the subject of an entire episode in one work. Squirrels, with their hilarious antics around bird feeders, are a source of endless fascination, even as are the lowly one-</page><page sequence="3">Flights of Fancy 41 celled creatures that inhabit roadside ponds. After all, modern rodents and protozoans share the potential of evolving into something more "advanced/7 perhaps even into sentient beings, as did the Precambrian bacteria that eventually led to humans. But it is birds that most often capture- and hold- the writer's imagination. They are, for him, the epitome of the animal kingdom, its highest fliers, surpassed now in this respect (thanks to aviation technology) only by man himself. Man, of course, is at the very heart of Eiseley's literary enterprise, and the writer's attitude toward his "own kind" goes a long way in explaining his affinity for birds. Despite Eiseley's constant emphasis on man's innate capacity for cooperation and compassion and his de- fense of the human race against the behavioristic "revelations" of such popular writers as Robert Ardrey, whose 1961 best seller African Genesis stressed the selfishness, greed, and aggressiveness of ancestral man,4 that attitude was, at best, ambivalent. Nowhere is this ambivalence more starkly revealed than in his essay "Strangeness in the Propor- tion," in an "autobiographical" episode5 in which he directly confronts the darker side of human nature. The narrator, as so often in Eiseley a wanderer, is overtaken at dusk by a thunderstorm. He has lost his way in "a rural and obscure corner of the United States" (Night Country 146) and tries to flag down a horse-drawn wagon loaded with hay careening down a country road to ask the driver, perched high in "some limbo of lightning and storm" (147), for directions or perhaps a ride. The rain seems to let up for a moment. Eiseley writes: Then, in a bolt of light that lit the man on the hayrick, the waste of sodden countryside, and what must have been my own horror-filled countenance, the rain plunged down once more. In that brief, momen- tary glimpse within the heart of the lightning, haloed, in fact, by its wet shine, I had seen a human face of so incredible a nature as still to amaze and mystify me as to its origin. It was- by some fantastic biological exaggeration- two faces welded vertically together along the midline, like the riveted iron toys of my childhood. One side was lumpish with swollen and malign excrescences; the other shone in the blue light, pale, ethereal, and remote- a face marked by suffering, yet serene and alien to that visage with which it shared this dreadful mortal frame. (147) As the narrator instinctively shrinks back, the figure on the hayrick, aware of his shame, raises "a shielding hand to his [. . .] face" (147) and passes out of view. Eiseley comments on this nightmarish, eidetic encounter, clearly an epiphany: [T]hat I saw the double face of mankind in that instant of vision I can no longer doubt. I saw man- all of us- galloping through a torrential land-</page><page sequence="4">42 ISLE scape, diseased and fungoid, with that pale half-visage of nobility and despair dwarfed but serene upon a twofold countenance. I saw the great horses with their swaying load plunge down the storm-filled track. I saw, and touched a hand to my own face. (148, emphasis added) The narrator's almost unconscious gesture at the end of the quoted passage is a fine touch. It links him to all of humanity: he too has a double face, which no other earthly creature possesses. Because, en- dowed with consciousness and its refined twin, reason, man is aware of his actions and, as theologians and ethicists tell us, must choose between good and evil. All too often he makes the wrong choice, pursu- ing, as Ardrey had argued, his own personal gain, sometimes violently, at the expense of the common good. This is man's "demonic" aspect. But man is also endowed with a conscience (the flip side of conscious- ness6), whose refined twin, compassion, allows him to feel pity for the fallen. As Eiseley eloquently argues in his celebrated essay "The Star Thrower," it is this "angelic" aspect of man7 that ultimately liberates him from "Darwin's tangled bank of unceasing struggle, selfishness, and death" (Unexpected Universe 91), because reason alone- man's remarkable ability to comprehend and manipulate the world about him- is not enough to deliver him from his dangerous aggressive tendencies. These tendencies, Eiseley writes in the essay "The Time of Man," survive in his "old and lower brain- a fossil remnant [...] dragged with him, unfortunately, out of the Ice Age" (Darwin 226). This is exactly what Ardrey had been saying all along. The difference is that, unlike Ardrey, Eiseley sees both faces of the human animal. "Perhaps," he muses in another essay, "How Man Became Natural," "man has always been both saint and sinner- even in his raw begin- nings" (Firmament 111).8 A close comparison of the two scenes we have just considered is revealing. Paradoxically, the setting of the first, in which Eiseley tries to penetrate the world of birds, is a modern metropolis, whereas that of the second, in which he takes the measure of man, is a sparsely popu- lated rural area. However, each setting yields its improbable secrets because, as the writer contends in "The Judgment of the Birds," basic truths can be glimpsed in the unlikeliest of places through "natural revelation," the only requirement being the isolation of the observer (Immense Journey 164-65). Both episodes take place in dim light, but in the case of the first, it is the light of dawn, which holds the promise of another day, whereas in the case of the second, it is twilight, with "the lowering dark" (Night Country 147) of a sudden thunderstorm. While it is the flapping wings of pigeons that intensify the light over Manhat- tan's rooftops, gently revealing their quaint architecture, it is a bolt of lightning, with the rain stopping for a moment to clear the view, that</page><page sequence="5">Flights of Fancy 43 lights up the hideous face of the farmer- a starker contrast is difficult to imagine. The very different reactions of the protagonist in these two "numinous encounters"9 underscore the dichotomy. In the first, he leans farther out of the hotel window, ready to enter "that city of light" (Im- mense Journey 166, emphasis added) illuminated by the pigeons; in the second, he shrinks back in horror from elemental man- the "dark figure of the farmer" ( Night Country 147, emphasis added) on the hayrick. In virtually every respect, birds and humans appear as polar op- posites in these scenes. Light and dark, day and night, life and death, good and evil, the sacred and the profane- these are some of the an- titheses that arise from the juxtaposition. It is, of course, not all quite so simple, and more needs to be said about Eiseley's view of man to see how it relates to birds, but something of the dichotomy we have established runs as a refrain through much of his work. 2. The Modern Dilemma Eiseley's skeptical attitude toward what is ostensibly humankind's greatest achievement, modern science and technology, is familiar to Eiseley aficionados and well documented in the critical literature (Mary Ellen Pitts has even devoted a book-length postmodernist study to the subject10). However, since it brings sharply into focus his view of man,11 a brief overview of the writer's argument with regard to science and his critique of Western civilization (the two are inextricably linked) would not be out of place in the context of the present inquiry.12 The problem, Eiseley asserts, begins very early- with primordial man's ejection from the proverbial Garden of Eden. The Garden was his first world, the world of nature, "which cherished and brought him into being" ("The Last Magician," Invisible Pyramid 137). In that realm he lived, as all life on the planet, primarily by instinct. But in the course of evolution a strange thing happened. He was already walking upright when, for reasons still not fully understood, his brain mushroomed, allowing him "[to slough] instinct away for a new interior world of consciousness" ("How Human Is Man?" Firmament 124). Man's "fall from grace" was the direct result of the growth of his intellect and its by-product, language, which precipitated him into his second world, the world of culture.13 "Scarcely had he stepped across the border of the old instinctive world," Eiseley writes, "when he began to create the world of custom. [. . .] He was, in fact, creating another nature, a new source of stability for his conflicting erratic reason" ( Firmament 124). It was an artificial</page><page sequence="6">44 ISLE realm, a "phantom universe" ("Man in the Autumn Light/' Invisible Pyramid 120) drawn out of man's mind and, as Eiseley suggests, limited only by his own creativeness. He entered into himself; he cre- ated society and its institutions. The exterior, natural world would be modified and pushed farther and farther back by the magic circle in which he had immured himself. Some societies would dream on for millennia in a world still close to nature; other roads would lead to the Greek thinkers and the Roman aqueducts. The history of the world- changers had begun. ("The Time of Man/' Darwin 232) "He is an inconceivably rare and strange beast [. . .]," Eiseley says of this emergent being. "With his coming came history, the art of the mind imposing itself upon nature. There has been no previous evolutionary novelty comparable to this save the act of creation itself" (227-28). Man's new world consumed him completely, but as long as human societies continued to slumber in the shadow of the natural world, there was no apparent danger. The rift between man and nature was there, but it did not immediately threaten the stability of the system. Equilibrium was maintained until the late Renaissance, when Western man, in rediscovering his classical heritage, first embraced inductive reasoning and the experimental method of science. This "invention of inventions," as Eiseley calls it ("A Hidden World," Man Who Saw 62-63), bore bounteous fruit and eventually led to the industrial and technological revolutions, but there were hidden dangers as well. "There is [. . .] more than one world to be drawn out of nature," Eiseley hints darkly ("Strangeness in the Proportion," Night Country 134). "It was in the West," he reminds us, "that the whirlpool began to spin" ("How Human Is Man," Firmament 125). This was man's second fall from grace. Since then, a multitude of developing countries has eagerly joined the maelstrom, spreading the problem to the farthest corners of the earth. Eiseley credits Sir Francis Bacon with being the first great spokes- man of the new age, who said of the scientific method that it is "the foundation of all, for we are not to imagine or suppose, but to discover ; what nature does or may be made to do" (qtd. in Eiseley, "An Age of Violence," Man Who Saw 32, original emphasis). At the end of the six- teenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth, with dogmatic thinking on the wane and much reason for optimism, Bacon envisioned a Utopian society based on human reason, a "New Atlantis," as he called it, where science would be employed "for the uses of life" (qtd. in Eiseley, "An Age of Violence," Man Who Saw 39).14 But aware, as Eiseley puts it, of "men's lusts and rapacities" ("The Orphic Theatre," Man Who Saw 85), he also warned that the technological arts "have an ambiguous or</page><page sequence="7">Flights of Fancy 45 double use, and serve as well to promote as to prevent mischief and destruction, so that their virtue almost destroys or unwinds itself." "All natural bodies," Bacon declared in a passage anticipating Eiseley's stance on man, "have really two faces, a superior and inferior" (qtd. in Eiseley, "The Orphic Theatre," Man Who Saw 86). Blaise Pascal, who was born just three years before Bacon's death in 1626, was already able to discern an emerging pattern. Speaking of the growing human tendency to "demythologize" nature, he wrote: "There is nothing which we can- not make natural, there is nothing natural which we do not destroy" (qtd. in Eiseley, "How Natural Is 'Natural'?" Firmament 159). These early warnings went unheeded. "In fact," Eiseley writes of Bacon's hopes and expectations, "it could readily be contended that science, as he intended to practice it, has not been practiced at all" ("Strangeness in the Proportion," Night Country 133). Science and technology were a fundamentally novel development in human history, giving man unprecedented power over his environment. As a consequence, they wrought profound societal and psychological change, which Bacon, for all his perspicacity, did not foresee. For one thing, they completely transformed the nature of agriculture, the very basis of civilization. "Never before," Eiseley writes, "have such large masses of people been so totally divorced from the land [. . .]," which further "contributed to the alienation of man from nature" ("The Spore Bearers," Invisible Pyramid 82). For another, they forever altered man's perception of himself. Armed with machines of his own invention, the new urban man imagined himself to be, if no longer at the center of the Universe, then certainly its undisputed lord and master. After all, he was made in God's image, and now he could prove it. By the twentieth century, science had become a new religion, with its own ceremonial rituals and anointed priesthood. "To many," Eise- ley writes, "it replaces primitive magic as the solution for all human problems" ("The Spore Bearers," Invisible Pyramid 90). "Progress"15 was its watchword and consumer society its foundation. Outward-reaching (material) change was so rapid that internal (spiritual) growth could not keep pace. As a result, in an essay quoted above and provocatively titled "How Human Is Man?," Eiseley avers that the rise of science has come dangerously close to bringing into existence a type of man who is not human. He no longer thinks in the old terms; he has ceased to have a conscience. He is an instrument of power. [. . .] the moment such power [torn from nature] is brought into the human domain it partakes of human freedom. It is no longer safely within nature; it has become violent, sharing in human ambivalence and moral uncertainty. (Firmament 135, original emphasis)</page><page sequence="8">46 ISLE "Moral responsibility/' Eiseley underscores, "has difficulty in existing consistently beside the new scientific determinism" (141). In another es- say, invoking the teachings of Buddha, he says that "one cannot proceed upon the path of human transcendence until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future" ("The Spore Bearers," Invisible Pyra- mid 81-82). In other words, inward growth must accompany outward expansion, reserve and restraint temper dreams of conquest. This is something that never happened in the West nor in any of the developing countries that have embraced Western technology. Eiseley's assessment or, better, indictment of the Western scientific achievement is that, "great though it is," it "has not concerned itself enough with the creation ořbetter human beings [. . .]. It has concentrated instead upon things [. . .]" ("How Human Is Man?" Firmament 130). In a particularly devastating characterization, Eiseley refers to the modern urbanitě, a beneficiary of science, as "mass man" and "the asphalt man" (136). This is a creature who is perfectly prepared to "kill off everything" in order to make "more room" for humans. "We'll be able to synthesize food pretty soon" (128), he reasons. And in an essay tellingly titled "The World Eaters," Eiseley likens Homo sapiens to "a new bacterial strain" (Invisible Pyramid 62), "a planet virus" (64) that now threatens, quite literally, to destroy Earth. "A mathematical formula traveling weakly along the fibers of the neopallium," he points out in another essay, "may serve to wreck the planet. It is a kind of metabolic energy never envisioned by the lichen attacking a rock face or dreamed of in the flickering shadows of a cave fire" ("The Last Neanderthal," Unex- pected Universe 230). Poet that he is, Eiseley speaks of this new energy metaphorically, but always in apocalyptic terms: "The closer man and the natural world drew together, the more erratic became the behavior of each. Huge shadows leaped triumphantly after every blinding illu- mination. [. . .] unseen by many because it was so gigantically real, the multiplied darkness threatened to submerge the carriers of the light" ("The Star Thrower," Unexpected Universe 81-82). Clearly, according to Eiseley, Bacon's grand vision has gone off track. Instead of bringing salvation to humankind, the incipient science that he championed four centuries ago ultimately resulted in unspeakable new misery. Two world wars and especially the Cold War, which co- incided with Eiseley's creative life and was ever more dependent on weapons of mass destruction, made a mockery of Bacon's insistence that technological advancement always be "for the uses of life." All life on the planet was now under threat. And if humans did not destroy it in some ultimate conflagration, they would surely do so by attrition, cut- ting down the remaining "sunflower forests" (one of Eiseley's constant metaphors for the natural world),16 until nothing was left. "Once the</page><page sequence="9">Flights of Fancy 47 juggernaut is set in motion/' Eiseley writes, "to slow it down or divert its course is extremely difficult because it involves the livelihood and social prestige of millions of workers'' ("The Time Effacers," Invisible Pyramid 105). At the root of Eiseley's ambivalence about modern science is the determinism and positivism that it has fostered in the scientific com- munity. To Eiseley, very much aware of the uncertainties inherent in Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, the belief that science is all-powerful and, given enough time, will answer the ultimate ques- tions of life seemed like ultimate hubris. "We have learned a great deal about secondary causes," he writes in his essay "How the World Became Natural," "about the how of things. The why, however, eludes us [. . .]" (Firmament 4, original emphasis). It is precisely this shift in focus from the safe and sane world defined by the Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm with its mechanistic determinism to the new world of unpredictability and boundless possibility that made Eiseley a compatible subject for Pitts's postmodernist study. Needless to say, the object of Eiseley's vituperation is not science as such, to which he remained committed, but rather its misuse by a "dehumanized" scientific establishment- a perversion he linked di- rectly to man's dual nature.17 In the same essay in which he suggests that modern man, a product of the technological revolution, is not fully human, Eiseley includes the following litany of science's indisputably momentous achievements: Science has brought remedies for physical pain and disease; it has opened out the far fields of the universe. Gross superstition and petty dogmatism have withered under its glance. It has supplied us with fruits unseen in nature, and given an opportunity, has told us dramati- cally of the paradise that might be ours if we could struggle free of ancient prejudices that still beset us. No man can afford to ignore this aspect of science, no man can evade those haunting visions. ("How Human Is Man?" Firmament 139) Bacon would have been delighted- but, Eiseley hastens to add, "[i]t is the roar of the whirlpool [. . .] that breaks now most constantly upon our listening ears [. . .]" (139). It is of that roar that he chooses to speak.18 Today, more than a quarter of a century after Eiseley's death, "the blasphemous megatons of modern physics" ("The Time of Man," Darwin 221) that he spoke of with the intensity of a Biblical prophet are still there, waiting to be deployed, and humanity's capacity for self-destruc- tion remains undiminished. No wonder he opted for the birds.</page><page sequence="10">48 ISLE 3. The Wildness and Wonder of Birds "In Wildness is the preservation of the world." The sentiment ex- pressed in Thoreau's famous dictum19 was enthusiastically shared by Eiseley, who devoted several penetrating essays to his transcendentalist forerunner20 and quotes or mentions him in numerous other works.21 And for Eiseley, as for poets and thinkers throughout the ages, one of the highest expressions of wildness is the winged bird, as familiar as the house cat yet forever alien and beyond the pale of human reach. Thoreau no doubt used the word "wildness" in its now obsolete sense of wilderness , or the natural world untouched by humans.22 As we have seen, Eiseley draws a sharp distinction between that realm and the man-made world of culture, especially culture in its Western, "world-eating" manifestation. Modern man is twice removed from nature- once by virtue of having developed, many thousands of years ago, consciousness and language, and once again by virtue of having acquired, in relatively recent times (thanks to the scientific method), the Faustian power to control nature. Ironically, as Eiseley remarks in "How Human Is Man?" "[t]he stability of nature on the planet [. . .] is threatened by nature's own product, man" ( Firmament 128). At the opposite end of life's spectrum are the birds, almost totally instinctual creatures who never left the original Garden and threaten nothing. There is a magic about them, a certain, to use Henri Bergson's happy phrase, élan vital, that is usually reflected in Eiseley's treatment of birds- as in his characterization of them in the essay-cum-short story "The Bird and the Machine." "Birds," he writes, "are intense, fast-living creatures- reptiles, I suppose one might say, that have escaped out of the heavy sleep of time, transformed fairy creatures dancing over sunlit meadows" (Immense Journey 185, emphasis added). Eiseley readily admits that this is "a youthful fancy" (185) but clings to it nonetheless, citing by way of explanation a liberating experience he once had with a pair of sparrow hawks in his youth (more about that later). As the episode from "The Judgment of the Birds" examined at the outset of this study demonstrates, birds dance not only over sunlit meadows, but also over the dimly lit rooftops of a huge metropolis. At dawn, when the city is still fast asleep, it is a modern-age wilder- ness, and the pigeons floating up from their roosts momentarily have free rein. They offer a profound insight into the magic of birds and the irresistible- unto death- attraction they held for Eiseley. His fer- vent desire to transcend the species boundary and merge with all of the living world, however, is realized, for one brief moment, not with birds, but with a fellow mammal- a fox cub too young to recognize the enemy in man. In the essay-cum-short story "The Innocent Fox,"</page><page sequence="11">Flights of Fancy 49 the two roll around together in the dust, playing with a chicken bone from the fox's den. Such interspecies communion, the writer holds, is a way of breaking down ancient barriers and keeping "the universe at bay" ( Unexpected Universe 212).23 Another example of the mystery of birds is provided in Eiseley's short story "The Gold Wheel," in which birds are seen from a child's perspective. The child, who is running away from home on the back of a horse-drawn tea wagon, is overtaken by a thunderstorm and takes refuge in the hedges that border a countryside mansion ("the bishop's house"). In the "intermittent flashes of the lightning" he suddenly realizes he is not alone: In the hedge where I crouched [. . .] were many hundreds of brown birds, strangers, sitting immovable and still. They paid no attention to me. In fact, they were immersed in a kind of waiting silence so secret and immense that I was much too overawed to disturb them. [. . .] Today I know that those birds were migrating and had sought shelter from exhaustion. On that desolate countryside24 they had come unerringly down upon the thin line of the bishop's hedge. (Night Country 10, em- phasis added) Note that the emotion the birds inspire in the young protagonist, who is the narrator's former self, is awe- a result both of their profound indifference to him and their preternatural stillness amid the ragings of the storm. The passage represents the climax of this particular segment of the story. After the storm passes, the child crawls out of the hedges and makes his way back home (the tea wagon had "unaccountably vanished"). But the incident, together with several others in the story, makes him a confirmed fugitive from society, with a distinct rever- ence for life. Although the authenticity of "autobiographical details" in Eiseley's works is sometimes difficult to assess, it is quite likely that the writer's "imprinting" on birds stems from a childhood experience similar to the one described. Then there are the birds that appear out of nowhere during the narrator's continuing quest, in another episode of the "The Judgment of the Birds," for "natural revelations" and "visions." This time the action takes place not in New York City, but in a real wilderness- the Nebraska Badlands, where the narrator had been collecting "petrified bones of long-vanished creatures" ( Immense Journey 171) for a university museum (a verifiably autobiographical reference to summer field work that Eiseley did during his student years at the University of Nebraska). The explorer is trying to find his way out of the wasteland at sunset when he has his vision:</page><page sequence="12">50 ISLE It was then that I saw the flight coming on. It was moving like a little close-knit body of black specks that danced and darted and closed again. It was pouring from the north and heading toward me with the undeviating relentlessness of a compass needle. It streamed through the shadows rising out of monstrous gorges. It rushed over towering pinnacles in the red light of the sun, or momentarily sank from sight within their shade. Across that desert of eroding clay and wind-worn stone they came with a faint wild twittering that filled all the air about me as those tiny living bullets hurtled past into the night. (171, em- phasis added) The "wild twittering" in the desolate setting is, of course, an evoca- tion of the wildness of the birds, whose generic identity Eiseley does not yet reveal. The clay under the explorer's feet contains the chemical remains of the area's former residents- "fifty million years of bellowing monsters moving in a green world now gone so utterly that its very light was travelling on the farther edge of space" (171). Yet despite the recurrent die-outs in geologic time, life on the planet hangs on tena- ciously: witness the "little close-knit body of black specks" dancing and darting overhead in the unlikeliest of locations. The explorer picks up "a fistful of that ground" and holds it while that wild flight of south-bound warblers hurtled over me into the oncoming dark. There went phosphorus, there went iron, there went carbon, there beat the calcium in those hurrying wings. Alone on a dead planet I watched that incredible miracle speeding past. It ran by some true compass over field and waste land. It cried its individual ecstasies into the air until the gullies rang. It swerved like a single body, it knew itself and, lonely, it bunched close in the racing darkness, its individual entities feeling about them the rising night. And so, crying to each other their identity, they passed away out of my view. (172, emphasis added) Only now do we learn that the birds are migrating warblers, little long-distance travelers of many species indigenous to the western hemisphere, whose wildness is again emphasized ("wild flight"). A final reference to the unearthly setting ("dead planet") provides the backdrop necessary for a full appreciation of the riotous activity in the darkening sky. Note the miraculous reanimation of the chemical ele- ments that takes place on high and the subtle relativity of the motion depicted: not only are the warblers "hurtling" forward into the night, but, as the shadows deepen, the oncoming darkness itself "races" to engulf them. Through the use of such simple poetic devices as synec- doche and personification, Eiseley imaginatively animates the desolate scene, transforming it into an integrated, dynamic whole.</page><page sequence="13">Flights of Fancy 51 No sooner does the flock pass out of sight than, in a dramatic ges- ture calculated to capture the magic of the moment, Eiseley has the narrator drop his "fistful of earth/' In counterpoint to the "wild flight" and the "incredible miracle" just witnessed, the clay rolls "inanimate back into the gully at the base of the hill: iron, carbon, the chemicals of life" (172-73). We are back on the dead planet. Even in the face of death and dissolution, life miraculously persists, not only in the course of geologic time, but in every existential moment of being. That is the idea underlying the next episode of "The Judgment of the Birds," the part that lends the work its name. The scene abruptly shifts from bleak desert to lush forest- "a place of pouring waters and green leaves" (173) out of the narrator's dim past. The peripatetic ex- plorer is still in search of "miracles" and stumbles upon one quite by chance. He has "come over a mountain," "slogged through fern and pine needles for half a long day," and "on the edge of a little glade with one long, crooked branch extending across it," sits down to rest. Ideally situated to see the drama that will shortly unfold before his eyes, yet "concealed from the glade" (174), he falls asleep. Eiseley writes: When I awoke, dimly aware of some commotion and outcry in the clearing, the light was slanting down through the pines in such a way that the glade was lit like some vast cathedral. I could see the dust motes of wood pollen in the long shaft of light, and there on the extended branch sat an enormous raven with a red and squirming nestling in his beak. (174, emphasis added) The simile linking the glade to a vast medieval "cathedral" shot through with shafts of sunlight filtering through, not pines, but gothic embrasures underscores Eiseley's belief in the essential sacredness of nature, which for him was the ultimate place of worship.25 He goes on to say: The sound that awoke me was the outraged cries of the nestling's parents, who flew helplessly in circles about the clearing. The sleek black monster was indifferent to them. He gulped, whetted his beak on the dead branch a moment and sat still. Up to that point the little tragedy had followed the usual pattern. But suddenly, out of all that area of woodland, a soft sound of complaint began to rise. Into the glade fluttered small birds of half a dozen varieties drawn by the anguished outcries of the tiny parents. No one dared to attack the raven. But they cried there in some in- stinctive common misery, the bereaved and the unbereaved. The glade filled with their soft rustling and their cries. They fluttered as though to point their wings at the murderer. There was a dim intan- gible ethic he had violated, that they knew. He was a bird of death.</page><page sequence="14">52 ISLE And he, the murderer, the black bird at the heart of life, sat on there, glistening in the common light, formidable, unmoving, unperturbed, untouchable. (174-75, emphasis added) Eiseley makes the "crime" seem all the more egregious by meta- phorically staging it in a "temple" and having the "perpetrator" be a raven- in Western mythology, a traditional symbol of death and the devil himself (memorably used by Poe in his famous poem). Note how even the long branch on which "the black bird at the heart of life" whets its beak after gulping down the "squirming nestling" is dead, as though everything the raven touches is doomed to perdition.26 But in the end it is the songbirds, the angels gathered in the glade, who prevail. I quote the passage in full because it epitomizes the writer's emphatically humanistic stance: The sighing died. It was then I saw the judgment. It was the judgment of life against death. I will never see it again so forcefully presented. I will never hear it again in notes so tragically prolonged. For in the midst of protest, they forgot the violence. There, in that clearing, the crystal note of a song sparrow lifted hesitantly in the hush. And finally, after painful fluttering, another took the song, and then another, the song passing from one bird to another, doubtfully at first, as though some evil thing were being slowly forgotten. Till suddenly they took heart and sang from many throats joyously together as birds are known to sing. They sang because life is sweet and sunlight beautiful. They sang under the brooding shadow of the raven. In simple truth they had forgotten the raven, for they were the singers of life, and not of death. (175, emphasis added) The raven is forgotten, because life on earth has no sense of time and hence no existential memory. Although ethologists would prob- ably disagree, only the human animal, which has sacrificed wildness (and wilderness) for civilization, has been able to truly transcend the time barrier that separates one moment of awareness from the next. It is noteworthy that there is no interaction here between the narrator and his subjects. He is strictly an observer watching from the wings because, as Eiseley explains, "man is an intruder into such silences" (173). Only on rare occasions such as this is he able to peer back, wist- fully, into the Garden. 4. Birds as a Symbol of Freedom Closely related to the wildness of birds is their celebrated freedom. The sight of a bird soaring in the sky has always evoked in earthbound</page><page sequence="15">Flights of Fancy 53 man a sense of vicarious liberation from the bonds of civilization and inspired lyricists the world over to flights of fancy. Consider, for ex- ample, the great Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin. In 1823, while in exile in the south of Russia for writing incendiary verse, Pushkin composed a luminous lyric in celebration of the Easter season called simply "Ptichka" (A Little Bird): In alien lands devoutly clinging To age-old rites of Russian earth, I let a captive bird go winging To greet the radiant spring's rebirth. My heart grew lighter then: why mutter Against God's providence, and rage, When I was free to set aflutter But one poor captive from his cage. (12)27 In the poem, which is in the first person and has autobiographical overtones, Pushkin expressed humankind's ancient desire, as old as civilization itself, to be free of political shackles and cultural constraints. It is a freedom, he suggests wryly, that is granted only to birds. Eiseley, too, has contributed to the genre of the avian lyric. Although freedom per se is not mentioned in his early poem "To a Homeland Bird Seen in a Storm," it is implicit in the sparrow hawk's flight as it circles over the "checkered // Grainfields" of the poet's homeland (Nebraska) and in the bird's "scornful" demeanor. Eiseley writes: [. . .] I see you circle And climb through the rain and dusk. Beat less scornfully over me, tiny, high-hearted Adventurer under the storm's wing. Men and their guns Are no dearer to me than to you. ( Lost Notebooks 48) In disavowing his human predatory nature, the poet claims fraternal allegiance to the "hawk":28 Sparrowhawk [sic], I am your brother Though footsore and weary, not wingless, Having, like you, the hawk's mind [...]. (49) Notably, he too can soar, if only in the mind. As with Pushkin in exile, the poet's liberty is largely imagined. As I have suggested, birds in Eiseley's works are most often seen as the antipode of man- and as an antidote to the "civilizing" effect humans have had on nature. In the opening passage of "The Gold</page><page sequence="16">54 ISLE Wheel/' a short story cited earlier, Eiseley traces the dichotomy, placing it squarely in the middle of the Cold War: In the waste fields strung with barbed wire where the thistles grow over hidden mine fields there exists a curious freedom. Between the guns of the deployed powers, between the march of patrols and policing dogs there is an uncultivated strip of land from which law and man himself have retreated. Along this uneasy border the old life of the wild has come back into its own. Weeds grow and animals slip about in the night where no man dares to hunt them. A thin uncertain line fringes the edge of oppression. The freedom it contains is fit only for birds and floating thistledown or a wandering fox. Nevertheless there must be men who look upon it with envy. (Night Country 3, emphasis added) As civilization retreats, wilderness advances, bringing with it the free- dom that the "old life of the wild" has always known. Its harbingers are a fox (Eiseley's favorite mammal), thistledown (floating down from the first line of the story), and, of course, birds. Ironically, the strip of land on which wildlife has regained a foothold is "strung with barbed wire" and riddled with mines, which is why the freedom that obtains there is a "curious" one. Man, sitting on either side of the divide, can- not partake of it, however much he may want to. Such freedom exists not only in no man's land. "[Precisely similar lines," Eiseley notes, "run in a delicate tracery along every civilized road in the West [. . .]" (3-4). He has in mind the "hedges of thorn apple and osage orange" that line the roadside and constitute "the last refuge of wild life between the cultivated fields of civilization" (4). (It is in such hedges bordering the bishop's house that the child hero of "The Gold Wheel" sits out the storm together with the brown birds.) What is more, as we learn at the end of the story, "the lines are everywhere- a net running through one's brain as well as the outside world" (12). Man, with his convoluted brain and free will, can elect to be either a part of nature or its adversary. It is up to him to get on the right side of the line and in tune with the birds. In the central episode of "The Bird and the Machine"- the title, with little loss in meaning, could be transcribed as "Nature and Civilization"- Eiseley's narrator, perhaps remembering his fraternal ties to the sparrow hawk, makes the right choice. He had "joined some colleagues heading [. . .] into a remote windy tableland" (Immense Journey 185) in search of fossils, but his instructions were also "to help capture some birds" (186) for the museum. As a result of a transformative expe- rience he had "up there among the escarpments of that range," Eiseley informs his reader, "I can never bear to see a bird imprisoned" (185). The bird that he captures, with considerable difficulty and not without injury to his person and professional pride, happens to be a sparrow</page><page sequence="17">Flights of Fancy 55 hawk- "a fine young male in the prime of life" (189). The female got away through a hole in the roof of the dilapidated cabin where the pair had been nesting. Once subdued, the bird lies impassively in his captor's bloodied hand, peering fiercely at him. Eiseley writes: "He neither gave nor expected mercy and something out of the high air passed from him to me, stirring a faint embarrassment" (189). The embarrassment resolves itself the next morning, when the narrator sets out to build a proper cage for his captive. Eiseley sets the scene meticulously, moving from the physical to the ambient and then the speculative in a concise three-step progression: "The sky was a deep blue, and one could see for miles over the high outcroppings of stone. [. . .] A wind as cool as a mountain spring ran over the grass and stirred my hair. It was a fine day to be alive" (190). The narrator wonders where the sparrow hawk's mate might be and concludes that she is "in the next county by now" (190). Acting on impulse, he takes the bird out of the box in which it had been stowed for the night to have a look at it before building the cage. I got him right out in my hand with his wings folded properly and I was careful not to startle him. He lay limp in my grasp and I could feel his heart pound under the feathers but he only looked beyond me and up. I saw him look that last look away beyond me into a sky so full of light that I could not follow his gaze. The little breeze flowed over me again, and nearby a mountain aspen shook all its tiny leaves. I suppose I must have had an idea then of what I was going to do, but I never let it come up into consciousness. I just reached over and laid the hawk on the grass. (190-91) The fact that the events of the story take place in the spring is mentioned but not emphasized,29 and Eiseley draws no analogy between himself and the bird, yet there is a distant echo here of Pushkin's clandestine eulogy to freedom. Eiseley writes of the sparrow hawk he has just released: He lay there a long minute without hope, unmoving, his eyes still fixed on that blue vault above him. It must have been that he was al- ready so far away in heart that he never felt the release from my hand. He never even stood. He just lay with his breast against the grass. In the next second after that long minute he was gone. Like a flicker of light, he had vanished with my eyes full on him, but without actually seeing even a premonitory wing beat. He was gone straight into that towering emptiness of light and crystal that my eyes could scarcely bear to penetrate. For another long moment there was silence. I could</page><page sequence="18">56 ISLE not see him. The light was too intense. Then from far up somewhere a cry came ringing down. (191) The expected epiphany, involving both birds, follows: I was young then and had seen little of the world, but when I heard that cry my heart turned over. It was not the cry of the hawk I had captured; for, by shifting my position against the sun, I was now see- ing further up. Straight out of the sun's eye, where she must have been soaring restlessly above us for untold hours, hurtled his mate. And from far up, ringing from peak to peak of the summits over us, came a cry of such unutterable and ecstatic joy that it sounds down across the years and tingles among the cups on my quiet breakfast table. I saw them both now. He was rising fast to meet her. They met in a great soaring gyre that turned to a whirling circle and a dance of wings. Once more, just once, their two voices, joined in a harsh wild medley of question and response, struck and echoed against the pinnacles of the valley. Then they were gone forever somewhere into those upper regions beyond the eyes of men. (191-92) Perhaps it is worth pointing out that, like most avian raptors, spar- row hawks usually mate for life- a fact that lends the scene a certain romantic ambiance. As we have seen, freedom in Eiseley does not involve any such moral category as free will or ethical choice. These are human precepts, and as such, have no relevance to birds. What birds do have is the freedom to live their lives as they were meant to live them, in their own natural and unrestricted environment. Only man can take that freedom away- or return it, if he so chooses. 5. Birds in Conflict with Civilization Given the dichotomy of bird and man in Eiseley's world, it is inevitable that at points of contact there would be friction between the two. Not surprisingly, the conflict is almost always at the bird's expense. Birds end up as mute victims of technological "progress" and the encroach- ment of civilization. We have just seen an example of this in the discussion of birds as a symbol of freedom, with the capture of the sparrow hawk. True, this time the bird was released unharmed, but not all predators, even of the human variety, are embarrassed by their exploits or feel pity for their prey. Certainly not the anonymous duck hunter in Eiseley's meditative short story "One Night's Dying" who left a crippled victim to its fate.</page><page sequence="19">Flights of Fancy 57 The narrator encounters it while strolling down a desolate beach. "[. . .] I see ahead of me/' Eiseley writes, "a bleeding, bedraggled blot on the edge of the white surf. As I approach, it starts warily to its feet. We look at each other. It is a wild duck [. . .] with a shattered wing. [. . .] Before I can cut off its retreat it waddles painfully from its brief refuge into the water" (Night Country 173). Let us note in passing the allitera- tive epithets "bleeding" and "bedraggled" applied to the métonymie "blot," which quickly resolves into a waddling duck. The bird's attempt to escape is thwarted by the breakers: The sea continues to fall heavily. The duck dives awkwardly [. . .] under the fall of the first two inshore waves. I see its head working seaward. A long green roller [. . .] rises and crashes forward. The black head of the waterlogged duck disappears. This is the way wild things die, without question, without knowledge of mercy in the universe, knowing only themselves and their own pathway to the end. (173) Rounding off the episode, the narrator strolls farther up the beach and reflects on the hunter. "I wonder [. . .]," he muses, "if the man who shot that bird will die as well" (173, emphasis added). The double entendre is probably intentional. But it is not only in the predator-prey relationship that human be- ings, today armed not with a flint knife but a double-barreled shotgun, can harm the "lesser creatures." It can happen through indifference or sheer neglect in the very heart of the civilized world because, as the next episode of "One Night's Dying" demonstrates, civilization takes little notice of the remnants of nature surviving in its midst. The episode takes place in New York City, one of the writer's favorite haunts.30 The narrator, while "strolling sleepless as usual toward early breakfast time in Manhattan," sees "a sick pigeon huddled at an uncomfortable slant against a building wall on a street corner" (175). He feels sorry for the bird but, having "no instrument of help," walks on. Eiseley writes: At this moment I grew aware of something I had heard more loudly in European streets as the factory whistles blew, but never in such inten- sity as here [. . .].31 All around me the march of people was intensifying. It was New York on the way to work. Space was shrinking before my eyes. The tread of innumerable feet passed from an echo to the steady murmuring of a stream, then to a drumming. A dreadful robot rhythm began to rack my head, a sound like the boots of Nazis in their heyday of power. I was carried along in an irresistible surge of bodies. (175) A block away he manages to look back. What he sees is disquieting: No one hesitated at that corner. The human tide pressed on, jostling and pushing. My bird had vanished under that crunching, multifooted</page><page sequence="20">58 ISLE current as remorselessly as the wounded duck under the indifferent combers of the sea. I watched this human ocean, of which I was an unwilling droplet, rolling past, its individual faces like whitecaps passing on a night of storm, fixed, merciless, indifferent; man in the mass marching like the machinery of which he is already a replace- able part, toward desks, computers, missiles, and machines, marching like the waves toward his own death with a conscious ruthlessness no watery shore could ever duplicate. I have never returned to search in that particular street for the face of humanity. (175-76) What we have here, of course, is Eiseley's "mass man" (a.k.a. "the asphalt man") in action. Reinforced by the wave metaphor, the representation of this social type is one of the strongest narrative condemnations of humankind in all of Eiseley. A much more muted condemnation of humankind, also involving pigeons, may be discerned in Eiseley's essay-cum-short story "The Brown Wasps." Implied more than openly expressed, it is contained in the episode in which a subway system is built in Philadelphia (a city Eiseley knew well), replacing the old elevated railway "with its barnlike stations containing nut-vending machines" (Night Country 232). The pigeons that had flourished among the peanut-eating crowds on the "El"- "generally one flock to a station," they "flapped in and out of its stanchions and steel work or gathered in watchful little audiences about the feet of anyone who rattled the peanut-vending machines" (232)- were suddenly, when the trains went underground, deprived of a reliable food source that had sustained "unnumbered generations" (233) of them. Let us note in passing the finesse of Eise- ley's epithet "barnlike" with respect to the stations where the pigeons fed. He likens the disappearance of the ancient railway to "a great [food-bearing] river subsiding suddenly into desert sands" (232). The birds flap around the deserted stations hopefully for a while, wait- ing for the "momentary drought" (233) to pass, but finally give up and depart. However, when demolition crews begin taking down the stanchions with pneumatic drills and acetylene torches, the flocks return- "strangely, momentarily"- to their old haunts, mistaking the new, destructive rattle for the old, productive one. Eiseley uses this ironic conflict between man and bird, brought on by the advance of civilization, not for its own sake (the pigeons were perfectly happy receiving handouts from humans), but to demonstrate the persistence of memory, which is one of his major themes. Even so, his empathy with the birds is unmistakable. Presently, humans are in the ascendant. But birds (as we have seen) are resilient creatures, and they have all the time in the world. They hover on the fringes of civilization, just waiting, as Eiseley suggests</page><page sequence="21">Flights of Fancy 59 in "The Bird and the Machine/' to take over. First, there is a deserted backwoods cabin- an outpost of civilization, such as the one in which the protagonist captures the sparrow hawk: [Tļhere were holes in the roof and the birds had come in and were roosting in the rafters. [. . .] A cabin going back to nature in a wild place draws them till they come in, listening at the eaves, I imagine, pecking softly among the shingles till they find a hole and then suddenly the place is theirs and man is forgotten. (Immense Journey 187) Then an entire city is abandoned (as may happen after a nuclear ca- tastrophe), and the birds move in. In yet another acerbic rejection of humankind's earthly dominion, Eiseley says he would not be sorry to see man gone: Sometimes of late years I find myself thinking the most beautiful sight in the world might be the birds taking over New York after the last man has run away to the hills. I will never live to see it, of course, but I know just how it will sound because I've lived up high and I know the sort of watch birds keep on us. I've listened to spar- rows tapping tentatively on the outside of air conditioners when they thought no one was listening, and I know how other birds test the vibrations that come up to them through the television aerials. 'Ts he gone?" they ask, and the vibrations come up from below, "Not yet, not yet." (187) Such a resolution of the conflict between nature and culture, in which the tables are turned on humans and victim becomes victor, should not come as a complete surprise. We have seen intimations of it in "The Judgment of the Birds," where, in a kind of dress rehearsal of the final takeover, the pigeons sally forth at dawn to savor Manhat- tan while most of the city's current denizens are sleeping peacefully in their beds. If Eiseley's doomsday scenario ever plays out, it will be the birds' ultimate revenge. 6. The Larger Picture I do not believe Loren Eiseley was a bird watcher. Born some twenty years before the Great Depression, he belonged to an earlier generation of Americans among whom bird watching was not yet in vogue. However, though he may never have kept a life list, Eiseley was certainly a lifetime observer of birds. His oeuvre offers eloquent testimony to that fact.</page><page sequence="22">60 ISLE We have identified and briefly discussed three distinct roles that birds play in Eiseley's works. Symbolic in essence, the roles are predi- cated on binary oppositions involving birds and men. As we have seen, Eiseley uses birds as a symbol of 1) the wildness and wonder of nature (wilderness and civilization are opposed); of 2) freedom (flight and flightlessness are opposed); and of 3) the vulnerability of nature to human intrusion (victim and victor are opposed). The roles are not mutually exclusive. Thus, the pigeons that hover at dawn over New York, "the greatest city of the world eaters" ("The Time Effacers," Invisible Pyramid 115), represent not only the wildness of nature (i.e., the natural order as it was before the advent of man), but also the freedom implicit in that wildness; this, ultimately, is why the narrator wants so fervently to join them. Likewise, as already noted, the released sparrow hawk represents not only the freedom of wild things, but also, in its capture and confinement, the fundamental conflict that exists between wilderness and civilization (the vulnerability of nature is revealed). The interrelatedness of the roles reflects their continuity in nature: they are nothing more than different aspects of the bird as it is seen by men- or at least by one man. Other avian functions in Eiseley could well be posited. By shift- ing the emphasis a bit, it is possible, for example, to speak of birds as fugitives from civilization or, on the contrary, as exemplars of nature's resilience to adversity. Or to highlight their constancy and bravery. Inevitably, such categories are related to the delineated ones (indeed, we have peripherally touched on some of them). One could also point to Eiseley's numerous casual references to birds. Such birds are usually not identified by family, genus or species, serving as mere markers of the living world. Here is a typical example from "The Star Thrower," in which the author (and not just the narrator) deliberates with the ghost of his dead mother, whose "torn eye" stares at him from an old photograph with ragged edges: "But I do love the world," I whispered [...]. "I love its small ones, the things beaten in the strangling surf, the bird, singing, which flies and falls and is not seen again." I choked and said, with the torn eye still upon me, "I love the lost ones, the failures of the world." It was like the renunciation of my scientific heritage. (Unexpected Universe 86, original emphasis)32 All of these considerations, however, would add little to the overall picture; they would only confirm Eiseley's abiding interest in and fascination with birds. That Eiseley is concerned primarily with the symbolic aspect of birds is evident from the fact that there is precious little physical</page><page sequence="23">Flights of Fancy 61 description in his works. Nowhere does he marvel at the lightness of bone that allows a bird to take wing, delight in the delicate iridescence of its feathers, or reflect on the amazing diversity of beak shapes and functions- all a legitimate concern of the literary naturalist. What he focuses on instead is situation , gesture , and action , which lend themselves naturally to allegorical interpretation.33 Thus, the pigeons flying out at dawn over Manhattan (situation) and illuminating the city's cupolas and spires with the morning light reflected from their fluttering wings (gesture) temporarily take over New York (action); allegorical interpre- tation: modern man is an intruder into the natural world, and when he is away, the wild things move in. Similarly, the sick pigeon dying in that same metropolis (situation), huddled against a building on a street corner (gesture), is trampled to death by the morning rush-hour crowds (action); allegorical interpretation: modern man, obsessed by his second world, is oblivious of the first. If birds in his works are any indication, Eiseley is less a literary naturalist than a philosopher of nature. Birds for him are not objects of description but rather subjects for contemplation, within the framework of his referential system, of which humans are an integral part. Rather than dwell on "inconsequential" detail or pictorial representation, he draws attention to the larger picture. Yet in that cosmic sweep Eiseley ignores some basic earthly ques- tions. When he depicts birds as victims of civilization, for instance, he never brings up the overarching issue of habitat loss, which, as ecolo- gists are wont to point out, is the primary cause of recent biological extinction- the sixth largest ever on the planet and one brought about primarily by human activity, including agricultural development and urban sprawl.34 Nor, for that matter, does Eiseley delve much into extinction as such or any other burning environmentalist issue. Can the freedom fortuitously granted one sparrow hawk make up for all the lost ones? And has the species, referred to in field guides as "com- mon," suddenly come under threat? The answer to these questions holds the key, I think, to the reason why American environmentalists and ecocritics, who readily quote everyone from Henry David Thoreau and John Muir to Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson- all great nature writers, to be sure- generally ignore Eiseley.35 They do not see him as an ally in their cause, completely overlooking, because of its deliberate indirection, the tenor and power of his art. As noted earlier, birds are the tip of the iceberg in Eiseley's ani- mal kingdom. Amazingly, most of the phyla are represented- true, sometimes only by a single class (the sea-dwelling Echinodermata, for instance, by hapless star fish washed up by the sea)- with mammals a runner-up to birds in terms of frequency of reference. Like the birds, most of these creatures serve largely as a counterpoint to humans. Take,</page><page sequence="24">62 ISLE for example, an encounter with a muskrat reported in the essay "How Natural Is 'Natural'?" It occurs on a New England lake that has been pre-empted and civilized by man. All day long in the vaca- tion season high-speed motorboats, driven with the reckless abandon common to the young Apollos of our society, speed back and forth, carrying loads of equally attractive girls. The shores echo to the roar of powerful motors and the delighted screams of young Americans with uncounted horsepower surging under their hands. (Firmament 154) To swim in those roiling waters would be to court disaster. Sitting safely under a boat dock, far from the madding crowd, the narrator discovers an older world. There, in the shallows, he spies "a dark shadow moving swiftly over the bottom. It was the first sign of life I had seen in this lake, whose shores seemed to yield little but washed- in beer cans" (154-55). The shadow turns out to be a young muskrat, who shows little fear of the protagonist, approaching him closely. It is clear to Eiseley that the creature "had not [. . .] heard very much about men" and was laboring under the delusion that "animals and men were still living in the Garden of Eden" (155). The facts of the matter were quite different. "On this pleasant shore," Eiseley observes, "a war existed and would not end until nothing remained but man" (155). Rather than engage the muskrat in a game, as he once did with the equally friendly fox cub, the narrator shoos it away. "You are in the wrong universe," he warns, "and must not make this mistake again. I am really a very terrible and cunning beast. I can throw stones" (156). With this, he drops a pebble into the water, and the muskrat, presum- ably having learned its lesson, paddles warily away. The narrator, too, takes his leave, "obscurely pleased that darkness had not gained on life by any act of mine" (157). The muskrat clearly fits Eiseley's avian paradigm. Like the released sparrow hawk, it is a beneficiary of the freedom granted it by an act of compassion- one that may keep it from getting cut to shreds by the teen-age mass men who have usurped the lake. Alternatively, as with the sick pigeon whose life is snuffed out by busy New Yorkers, its metaphorical function could be interpreted as relating to the age-old conflict between animals and civilization (after all, despite the narra- tor's best efforts, the muskrat just may get cut to shreds). Or finally, like the flock of warblers hurtling over a "dead planet," it may be seen as the magic spirit of the lake that perseveres despite all odds. Whatever the interpretation, the muskrat demonstrates that birds and other creatures depicted by Eiseley have much in common when it comes to their relationship to humans.</page><page sequence="25">Flights of Fancy 63 Does Eiseley imbue animals with human feelings and motivation? Of course he does, just as poets have done from time immemorial. The question would be spurious, were it not for the fact that Eiseley is not only a poet who feels a special kinship to animals, but also a sci- entist with an obligation to objectivity, which is why some of his more literal-minded colleagues in the scientific community challenged him on the issue of anthropomorphism. In a brief entry in one of his post- humously published notebooks, which were not intended for publica- tion, Eiseley responds to his nameless critics with a "countercharge," accusing them of denying their own humanity by refusing to extend human impulses to other animals. "There is a sense," he writes, "in which when we cease to anthropomorphize, we cease to be men, for when we cease to have human contact with animals and deny them all relation to ourselves, we tend to cease to anthropomorphize ourselves [...]" (Lost Notebooks 200).36 Turning then to the related question of symbolism in the depiction of the natural world, Eiseley goes on to assert that all interpretation of reality is symbolic in essence. But there is a caveat: "[I]f we read it [our world] symbolically aloof from ourselves and our kindest impulses, we are returning to the pre-Deistic, pre-Romantic world of depraved Christianity- the world where man saw about him 'fallen nature/ with the devil slipping behind each tree" (200). "Modern anthropomorphiz- ing," the writer maintains, "consists in miming nature down to its ingredients, including ourselves. This is really only another symbolic reading, certainly no more 'real' than what I have been charged with" (200-01, emphasis added). The argument put forth in this casual notebook entry is neither conclusive nor very convincing, and certainly students of behaviorism, who are the chief opponents of anthropomorphism in animal studies, would be surprised to learn that they too read the world symbolically.37 Eiseley's implicit denial of scientific objectivity is in character, especially given what modern science, in his opinion, has become. What I think he really means, however, is that in poetry , even if it is grounded in sci- ence, scientific stricture must give way to poetic license. His own liter- ary works are a prime example of that injunction. "He was neither an ideologue nor a polemicist, or, for that matter, an especially systematic thinker," Eiseley's biographer, Christianson, says of his subject. "The beauty of language was paramount to him [. . .]" (389). In fact, because art looms so large in Eiseley's works, I have noted in passing some of the stylistic strategies and literary devices the writer uses to achieve a desired emotional effect. One of them, not previously mentioned, is the time-honored device of anthropomorphization.</page><page sequence="26">64 ISLE Another literary device that deserves special mention because it is central to Eiseley's art and relevant as well to his treatment of birds is the technique of defamiliarization.38 Looking at something from an unusual perspective and thus "making it strange" intensifies the emotional (aesthetic) effect of what is observed on the observer, as though it were being seen for the first time. The technique was the hallmark of surrealist writers and artists, who used it in erecting their fantastic dreamscapes. Although he did not share their ultimate goals (one of which was to free art from the constraints of reason), I would venture to say that Eiseley, a contemporary of Salvador Dali, was a surrealist at heart.39 Virtually every episode involving birds that we have considered undercuts in one way or another our expectations of them, much as Dali's drooping or crimped timepieces subvert our notion of time's steady flow. Pigeons are such commonplace, familiar creatures- who would ever expect to see them hovering triumphantly over rooftops in the surreal light of a New York City sunrise? Even more outlandish is the thought that man, due to some untoward event of his own making, would eventually abandon that city and let the birds take over. The list goes on, occasionally including episodes in which defamiliarization is coupled with anthropomorphization. The woodland birds that pronounce their "judgment" on the "murderous" raven are both defamiliarized and anthropomorphized. The same is true of the liberated sparrow hawk and its mate as they meet in the cloudless sky in an ecstatically erotic "gyre." It is symptomatic that in referring to the pair Eiseley uses the personifying personal pronouns "he" and "she" rather than the neuter "it." Personification is a corollary of anthropomorphism. Mary Ellen Pitts adds another dimension to Eiseley's use of defamil- iarization. Emphasizing the importance of the technique to the writer, she sees it primarily as a function not of aesthetics but of ideology, i. e., as an expression of the writer's extraliterary intent. Pitts writes: Eiseley's defamiliarization of "natural" is essential to his reconsid- eration of the human relationship to the environment. To be truly "human"- to define ourselves in terms of the nature that produced us- will require an understanding that moves away from the Enframed view of nature as that which we can isolate, fragment, understand, manipulate, and eventually- as Pascal suggested- destroy. It will require an understanding that looks to dreams and imagination, to insight and sympathy, to potential and unpredictability, to a dialogic understanding that allows for not only the scientist's but also the poet's and the amateur's insights. (179) By offering a fresh perspective on reality, defamiliarization can indeed open up new philosophical vistas more readily perceived in dreams</page><page sequence="27">Flights of Fancy 65 than in the laboratory. After all, what experiments did Einstein perform before conceiving of relativity? Pitts has a point. Although she makes no mention of anthropomorphism in her study, Eiseley's reliance on the device is consistent with Pitts's formulation of the writer's extraliterary intent. By attributing human impulses to other animals, Eiseley includes humans in the grand continuum of life, which extends down to the lowliest protozoan. In doing so, he breaks down existing conceptual barriers ("the Enframed view of nature") between the known and the unknown, the possible and the seemingly impossible, thus allowing for the emergence of what the critic calls a "dialogic understanding" between the scientist and the poet. This is precisely why Eiseley the poet says he will feel no remorse if the birds do indeed take over. Engaged in a dialogue with himself, he is confident as a scientist that the evolutionary niche presently occupied by man, the only truly sentient being on the planet, will successfully be filled by some other worthy but perhaps less rapacious contender. The overall emotional effect that Eiseley strives to achieve in coun- terposing birds to humans is admiration and/or concern for the former (thus, implicitly, for all of nature) and- I do not think I am putting it too strongly- a sense of despair in connection with the latter. Behind it all there stands a single question: Can man, through whose eyes the material universe has for the first time (to our knowledge) looked out upon itself with self-recognition, survive his own calculated and unremitting desecration of nature? In other words, is there a way for him out of the modern dilemma, which, as we know, is compounded of culture, civilization, science, and technology? If it exists at all, Eiseley writes in "The Last Magician," "it is to be found in the enlightenment of the spirit- some ability to have a perceptive rather than an exploi- tive relationship with his fellow creatures" (Invisible Pyramid 146). He forcefully pursues this line of reasoning in the essay: Today man's mounting numbers and his technological power to pollute his environment reveal a single demanding necessity: the necessity for him consciously to reenter and preserve, for his own safety, the old first world from which he originally emerged. His second world, drawn from his own brain, has brought him far, but it cannot take him out of nature, nor can he live by escaping into his second world alone. He must now incorporate from the axial thinkers40 an ethic not alone directed toward his fellows, but extended to the living world around him. He must make, by way of his cultural world, an actual conscious reentry into the sunflower forest he had thought merely to exploit or abandon. He must do this in order to survive. If he succeeds he will, perhaps, have created a third world which combines elements of the original two [. . .]. (154-55)</page><page sequence="28">66 ISLE As we see, in his unassuming yet compelling way, Eiseley insists on an ecological ethic much more far-reaching and profound in its implications than anything envisioned by even the most radical of environmental activists (the feasibility of his proposal, lacking as it does any discussion of its implementation, is another matter).41 The creation of a third world- a kind of retreat back into nature without relinquishing the tangible achievements of Western civilization- was Eiseley's fond hope. Anxious to reestablish the old syncretic universe that disintegrated after the fall, he never gave up on man, because humankind is so fundamentally different from the rest of the natural world and has such immense potential. As Eiseley writes in another notebook entry, [t]he living world is confined very largely to separate fractions of the whole which lies about it. The great forest tree dreams on indifferent to the world that passes on the road beneath it; the midnight owl hunts under Antares' light without the slightest curiosity about Antares; the pitted viper, drawn like a homing missile upon the warmth emanating from a rabbit's body, has no curiosity about the lives of rabbits. Such minds are like splinters from a shattered mirror; they give back a very small, particularized reflection of the outer world. ( Lost Notebooks 113-14) What follows is perhaps Eiseley's ultimate tribute to the human race: By contrast we might say that man is a much greater fragment. Alone among the animals he has escaped this pure utilitarian concentration which has compressed so many minds in nature into cramped little angles of view. Man in his moments of reflective thought has reached a fundamental point of divergence with the world from which he has emerged. He can contemplate the bird in flight and divorce his inter- est from the dinner plate. He is the only animal that can. (114, original emphasis) In the final analysis, because of his unique double face and the free will he acquired in the bargain, man's possibilities as compared to those of birds, such as the owl that knows nothing about the double star Antares, are infinite. It is up to him to decide which face he will present to eternity.</page><page sequence="29">Flights of Fancy 67 NOTES 1. Eiseley's literary works fall within the "short story- essay" continuum. At one extreme, narrative and plot predominate, at the other, there is the free range of scientific ideas. Many, perhaps most, of Eiseley's "concealed essays/' as he himself called them in "The Ghost World" (All the Strange Hours 182), with their mix of anecdotal evidence and abstract theory, fall somewhere in between, which makes them difficult to classify in terms of genre. This is why in borderline cases such as "The Judgment of the Birds" I resort to the cumber- some but technically more accurate term "essay-cum-short story." 2. In discussing Eiseley, most critics refer to his published books rather than to the short stories and essays that compose them. Though this procedure is a convenient shorthand, I propose to depart from it and will refer instead to the individual pieces. As Andrew J. Angyal points out in his excellent monograph on Eiseley, the writer's books are for the most part "editorial assemblages" (77), i.e., collections of miscellaneous shorter works, many of them previously published in periodicals. To an extent, this applies even to Eiseley's so-called autobiographies, The Night Country and All the Strange Hours , as well as to some of his more scholarly volumes devoted to the history of science, such as The Man Who Saw through Time (a series of essays on the life and times of Sir Francis Bacon). Therefore, to omit the particular source of the text under consideration is to ignore its true context. 3. "Brown wasps" is not a generic name but a reference to the insects' color. 4. Although he never mentions Robert Ardrey by name, Eiseley surely has the author of African Genesis in mind when, writing of Darwin's "natural selection" in his 1969 essay "The Star Thrower," he remarks that "famine, war, and death are not the sole instruments biologists today would accept as the means toward that perfection of which Darwin spoke. The subject is subtle and intricate [...]. Let it suffice to say here that the sign of the dark cave and the club became so firmly fixed in human thinking that in our time it has been invoked as signifying man's true image in books selling in the hundreds of thousands" (Unexpected Universe 83-84). 5. On the less-than-autobiographical nature of such episodes and their literary function in Eiseley's works, see note 9 below. 6. The Latin-based terms "conscience" and "consciousness" are etymologi- cally related, linked through a French connection with the idea of "know- ing." 7. The theologically charged terms "demonic" and "angelic" are not used by Eiseley in this particular context, but they express well the dichotomy he had in mind. 8. Following anthropologist Raymond Dart whose theories he espoused, Ardrey argues that, "[l]ong ago, [. . .] a line of killer apes branched off from the non-aggressive primate background" (29, emphasis added) and, for reasons "of environmental" and "predatory necessity," evolved into man. In "The Time of Man" Eiseley concedes that, based on the paleontological evidence, "these man-apes, or perhaps I should say some of these man-apes, had become killers of game" (Darwin 231, original emphasis), as Ardrey alleges. However, allowing</page><page sequence="30">68 ISLE for an altruistic component in human evolution, Eiseley does not agree that these man-apes were necessarily in a direct line of ascent to modern man. "It appears unlikely," he writes, "[. . .] that all such creatures survived to become men; some may have been living fossils in their own time. The last of them may have been exterminated by the spread of man himself" (232). 9. The epithet "numinous" is used by Eiseley scholar Andrew J. Angyal, who explains that such incidents from the writer's career "brought him face to face with a 'Mysterious Other'- miracles, one might almost say, that forced him to contemplate the subjective and illusive dimensions of the natural world" (80). "These 'numinous' encounters," Angyal observes, "often involve strange and solitary figures, shamans perhaps, bearing oracular messages decipherable to a mind open to such preternatural events" (81). "Another curious quality about these episodes," he goes on to say, "is that many of them have been heightened or altered to suit Eiseley 's thematic purposes- and some may be largely invented to fit the context of a particular essay" (81). In other words, far from being autobiographical, the episodes are products of the imagina- tion, which is why Eiseley's works, grounded in fact though they may be, are often difficult to classify as fiction or nonfiction. His crowning achievement as a writer was that he was able to straddle both worlds, blending them into a coherent and artistically viable system of literary expression. For more on Eiseley's "numinous encounters," see W. H. Auden (122), who may have been the first critic to take note of them as a literary device. 10. Pitts's Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science is a systematic attempt to link Eiseley's texts to a postmodernist reexamination of scientific "reality." It is the second such major study of the writer to date, the first being Carrithers's Mumford, Tate , Eiseley : Watchers in the Night. 11. Eiseley's view of man was expressed with sufficient regularity in his works to prompt a reviewer of All the Strange Hours to comment that "Eiseley has written this same book, under various disguises and titles, more than half a dozen times before [. . .]" (Olney 31). 12. The discussion in this section is based primarily on essays contained in three Eiseley collections: The Invisible Pyramid, The Firmament of Time , and The Man Who Saw through Time. The quoted pieces, which deal with the his- tory and philosophy of science, are expository in nature and largely lack the narrative (and autobiographical) component characteristic of Eiseley's more literary compositions. 13. Ever the evolutionist, Eiseley uses the word "culture" almost inter- changeably with "history," which he defines as cultural change, or "the evo- lutionary flow of ideas in the heads of men" (Invisible Pyramid 20). 14. "For the uses of life" is one of Eiseley's favorite Bacon sayings. He dwells on it at length in his essay "The Hidden World," elaborating on the significance of the phrase (Man Who Saw 63-65), and quotes it again in the concluding passage of what is perhaps his single best known essay, "The Star Thrower," where he refers to it as "Bacon's forgotten words" (Unexpected Universe 91). It might be said that Eiseley's mission as a writer was to resurrect those words and put science back on a humanistic track.</page><page sequence="31">Flights of Fancy 69 15. Because he sees progress as dubious at best, Eiseley frequently puts the word in quotation marks. See, for example, his discussion of technological progress in the essay "The Time Effacers" (Invisible Pyramid 105). 16. See, for example, 'The Flow of the River" (Immense Journey 24) and "The Last Magician" (Invisible Pyramid 155). The image of a sunflower forest is a reflection of some of the happier moments of Eiseley's lonely childhood in Nebraska, when he first became attuned to nature. 17. The aggressive side of human nature, Eiseley argues in "The Time of Man," has always been, "figuratively speaking," armed with "claws," but be- cause of modern technology, these claws can now be "fantastically extended" (Darwin 226). 18. Unlike Eiseley, the late astronomer Carl Sagan emphasizes in his popular works the bounties that science, which he likens to "a candle in the dark," bestows on humankind. For him, the glass is "half full." Yet even Sa- gan occasionally speaks of the dangers inherent in science and urges caution in its application, as in one of his last published books, The Demon-Haunted World. In particular, he writes that "[t]he unprecedented powers that science now makes available must be accompanied by unprecedented levels of ethical focus and concern by the scientific community [. . .]" (419, emphasis added). That sounds very much like Eiseley. For more on the telling difference in outlook between the two writers, see Carlisle (178). 19. It appears in his essay "Walking" (Thoreau 239). 20. See "Thoreau's Vision of the Natural World" (Star Thrower 222-34) and " Waiden : Thoreau's Unfinished Business" (Star Thrower 235-50). 21. In his essay-cum-short story "The Flow of the River," for example, in speaking of the fact that all life originated in water and that the human body is three-fourths water, Eiseley recalls that Thoreau, "in one of his moments of strange insight," had called "the emerald pickerel in Waiden Pond [...] 'animalized water'" (Immense Journey 20). 22. Even so, the word "wildness" retains the aura of its original (and still current) sense of the state of being wild, i.e., undomesticated and uncultivated by humans. 23. Eiseley scholar E. Fred Carlisle says of this episode that it is the "finest expression" of a recurrent motif in Eiseley- "his longing to escape into the animal world" (65). Eiseley's affinity for foxes was duly noted by his biographer Gale E. Christianson, who not only titled his monumental work on Eiseley Fox at the Wood's Edge after a self-referential remark the writer made in private correspondence (see Christianson 151), but also used as an epigraph to the work a previously unpublished Eiseley text, in which the writer, forever the fugitive in flight, speaks of having adopted "the ruse of the fox" to escape the "huntsman." The latter metaphor also appears in Eiseley's short story "The Gold Wheel," in which he writes, even more revealingly, "The fact that I wear the protective coloration of sedate citizenship is a ruse of the fox- I learned it long ago. The facts of my inner life are quite otherwise" (Night Country 4). It seems that Eiseley's infatuation with foxes derives at least in part from their traditional role of wily survivor in fables dating back to Aesop's time.</page><page sequence="32">70 ISLE 24. Desolate settings, whether characterized as such by the author or not, are a commonplace in Eiseley's narrative prose, and we shall encounter them again. Eiseley, it might be said, is a poet of desolation. Obsessed as a writer with time and death- entities that were also within the purview of his professional interests as an anthropologist- he frequently staged his set pieces on "coasts that invite shipwreck" ("The Star Thrower," Unexpected Universe 80). In one particularly revealing passage, which sets the tone of an entire essay, he writes: "It happened a long time ago at Curaçao [. . .], on a shore marked by the exposed ribs of a wrecked freighter. The place was one where only a student of desola- tion would find cause to linger" ("The Last Neanderthal," Unexpected Universe 214, emphasis added). This is why his no-nonsense biographer Christianson, in juxtaposing Eiseley to Thoreau, calls the latter a writer "of light" and the former a writer "of shadows" (423). "Unspeakable loneliness and melancholy," he writes, "were for Eiseley a part of the natural order" (427). 25. Referring in the essay "How Natural Is 'Natural'?" to a hallmark of his "bone hunting" profession, Eiseley writes, "I am a man who has spent a great deal of his life on his knees, though not in prayer. I do not say this last pridefully, but with the feeling that the posture [. . .] may have had some final salutary effect" (Firmament 176). Nature seen as a temple is, of course, a commonplace in nineteenth-century transcendentalist writing, and Eiseley continues the tradition. So does Jordan Fisher-Smith, who, in an essay written in the closing years of the twentieth century, says that "a great wrong has been perpetrated on people who have been convinced that God is more likely to show up at a church than somewhere else." To rectify the wrong, he suggests that "we start attending such things as fish runs and [bird] migrations as if we were attending church" (12). It is in the realm of nature (where Eiseley seeks them) that the real miracles are to be found. 26. Such traditional bird motifs, with apparent roots in folklore, are rare in Eiseley. In attempting to establish the role birds play in his works it would be useless to consult Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, which has a section on animals (vol. 1). Even the raven is not mentioned in this compendium as a harbinger of death, though that is one of the bird's key functions in the oral tradition. Except for the basic folkloric opposition of sky (bird) and earth (man), Eiseley usually treats birds creatively, weaving them into the complex fabric of modern associations that is the subject of the present study. 27. The poem is based on a Russian folk custom, with roots in the pagan past, of releasing captive birds on Annunciation Day. Occurring on March 25 (April 7 New Style), the holiday is intimately associated with church celebra- tions of the Easter season: Palm Sunday, Easter Sunday, Ascension Day, etc. The quoted translation is by the American Slavicist Walter Arndt, who preserved Pushkin's metrical pattern and rhyme scheme. While not a word-for-word rendition, it is faithful to the spirit and sense of the original. 28. The American Ornithologists' Union has recently renamed the sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius), which is now officially called the American kestrel. Not a true hawk, it is actually the smallest and most common of North American falcons.</page><page sequence="33">Flights of Fancy 71 29. Eiseley writes of the expedition: "We came into that valley through the trailing mists of a spring night" (Immense Journey 186). That is the only refer- ence in the story to the season in which the narrative unfolds. 30. In his later years, Eiseley often traveled by train from his home in Philadelphia to New York, where he frequented antique bookshops in search of bibliographic rarities for his growing collection of Darwiniana (see Chris- tianson 301-02). 31. Though he never set foot on the Continent, Eiseley did in fact once visit London on a business trip, "sometime in late 1951" (Christianson 298). 32. In the essay, the mother's "torn eye" is poetically associated with the "beautiful dark-lensed eyes bleared with sand" (Unexpected Universe 70) of the dead octopus that the narrator stumbles over on the desolate shores of Costabel with their grim harvest of washed up sea life. The photograph mentioned in the text, or one similar to it, is reproduced in Christianson's Eiseley biography with a quotation from "The Star Thrower" (see Christianson 276). 33. As Eileen Crist, a student of the sociology of behavioral and life sci- ences, notes, among animal behaviors gestures in particular "can be appre- hended as subjectively expressive, both loaded with import and intentionally addressed" (167). 34. For an informed and thoroughly readable analysis of the problem, see Richard Leakey's and Roger Lewin's book The Sixth Extinction, especially chapter 13. 35. One indicator of the problem is "The Audubon Canon," a short list of nature writing compiled by Verlyn Klinkenborg and published in 1998 by Audubon magazine. Included is "a handful of indispensable books from the past 100 years," which "appear here [. . .] because they changed the way we think about nature or because they are paragons of observation or of writ- ing" (102). "[W]eighted heavily toward the end of the century" (102), the list includes works by Muir, Leopold, and Carson, as well as by lesser-known writers, such as Apsley Cherry-Garrard, Vicki Hearne, and John McPhee. Eiseley, who spans the generations and in my opinion has made outstanding contributions in both areas of qualification, did not, however, make the grade. Similarly, the authoritative Literature and the Environment, an anthology of essays on nature and culture compiled by Lorraine Anderson, Scott Slovic, and John P. O'Grady in 1999 for classroom use, though it includes works by Thoreau, Muir, Leopold, Carson, and McPhee, to name but a few, omits Eiseley. Surely this is not an oversight on the part of the compilers, but a conscious rejection of the writer as an environmentalist. 36. Eiseley's thought is echoed by Dan Wylie, a very recent critic interested in anthropomorphization in fiction, who writes: "To anthropomorphize, in a crucial sense, is to do no more than what we do with one another. It is a kind of metaphor [. . .]" (116). 37. In the long and contentious history of animal studies, the view of be- haviorists battling with Darwin's alleged anthropomorphism had prevailed by the 1960s, but "neoanthropomorphism" has been making a steady come- back in the works of latter-day ethologists and animal psychologists. New battles are being fought on old battlegrounds. For an intriguing discussion of the subject, see John S. Kennedy's book The New Anthropomorphism. Need-</page><page sequence="34">72 ISLE less to say, the concern is not with the depiction of animals in art, but their representation in scientific studies- a difference that seems to have eluded Eiseley's detractors. 38. For a brief discussion of the importance of defamiliarization in Eiseley's treatment of time, one of his overriding concerns, see my study "Reaching beyond the Bridge: Time's Arrow in the Works of Loren Eiseley," page 94. 39. In their excellent early study of Eiseley, one of three monographs on the writer to come out in 1983, Gerber and McFadden point out Eiseley's "ventures in surrealism," to which they devote an entire chapter (9). No other major study of Eiseley refers to this subject. 40. Eiseley defines axial thinkers as "the creators of [the] transcendent values" (Invisible Pyramid 147) that found their expression in major world religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism. Follow- ing the Neolithic, "a period mostly marked by architectural and military triumphs" (146), these emergent creeds, each in its own way, represent "the rise of a new human image" that involves "a rejection of purely material goals" and "a turning toward some inner light" (147). As Eiseley writes, "[t]he destiny of the human soul became of more significance than the looting of a province" (147). 41. For a more pragmatic approach, see Aldo Leopold's closely reasoned argument for establishing a "land ethic" in his landmark essay of the same name (201-26). See also Barry Lopez's illuminating suggestions for dealing more equitably with the natural world in an essay provocatively titled "The Passing Wisdom of Birds" (202-06).
