Women should be silently riding their zebras. Diane Wakoski Le possible est un des provinces du vrai. Charles Baudelaire L A CASA DE LOS ESPIRITUS (1982), a novel by the Chilean magical real- ist Isabel Allende, and the paintings of the Spanish Surrealist Remedios Varo (1908-1963) are strikingly similar in their aesthetic structures and in projection of their mystical worlds. I want to link the work of these artists by pointing to certain shared visual meta- phors, and then by applying a theory of spatial organization in painting and sculpture put forth by the psychologist of art Rudolf Arnheim. In so doing, I will not attempt to present a "unified theory": on the contrary, I will distinguish the visual (and visualizing) capacities of narrative from those of painting, as well as discuss the capacities they share. My purpose is to elucidate the work of one artist in terms of the other-the purpose of most comparative and interartistic studies-and beyond this, to generalize about the fantas- 1 The term dates from the twenties in Germany, where it was used by the art critic Franz Roh to describe the relationship of painting to the reality it presented. See Menton 27 ff. 113</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE tic element that characterizes so much recent Latin American art, whether verbal or visual. The descriptive term "magic realism"-now employed almost exclusively to describe works of literature--was first applied to paintings;' the word "fantasy" derives from the Greek phantasia--literally, a "making visible." I compare the fantastical arts of Allende and Varo, then, the better to discover the processes by which each makes visible her invisible world of wonders. Unlike Isabel Allende's best-selling novel, the paintings of Remedios Varo are little known outside Latin America. This unfamil- iarity may be explained in part by Varo's geographical displacements, in part by the fact that much of her work is still in private collections in Mexico City. Her paintings are usually overlooked in exhibitions of European Surrealism; and since she is not identified as Latin American, they are also regularly excluded from exhibitions of Latin American art. Her exclusion is due to cultural as well as geographical boundaries. Varo's paintings create an idiosyncratic visual space of/ in which women are master builders. Her represented world is popu- lated by sensuous, aggressive, intelligent, mystical women who exist outside the visual conventions of female portraiture, and outside the usual cultural conventions of female activity as well. In short, the fe- male space imagined and depicted by Varo resists a number of powerful cultural categories and conditions; not surprisingly, it has also been resisted by the purveyors of those categories and condi- tions. A biographical orientation and general description of her characteristic images is, therefore, useful at the outset. Varo was born in 1908 in Angles, in the province of Gerona, Spain-the world of Dali and Mir6 and Picasso.2 At the age of seven- teen she went to Madrid to study art at the Academia de San Fernando; after finishing her degree in 1931, she spent a year in Paris, then returned to live in Barcelona, exhibiting her work with the so-called "grupo logic6fobo" in 1936. In 1937, she married the 2 Biographical information about Varo is available in Edouard Jaguer's book of reproductions of her paintings with accompanying text and chronology; Whitney Chadwick, especially Chapter 5, "Women Artists and the Hermetic Tradition"; Estella Lauter's Women as Mythmakers, Chapter 4 ("Remedios Varo: The Creative Woman and the Female Quest"); Ida Rodriguez Prampolini and Peter Engel's cata- logue text for an exhibition sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences. Engel calls attention to the fact that the year usually given as Varo's birth year, 1913, may be incorrect; I have accepted his theory and have cited 1908. The first full-length critical biography of Varo, by Janet Kaplan, begins to redress the general neglect of Varo's work in this country and elsewhere. The best reproductions to date of Varo's work are to be found in Octavio Paz and Roger Caillois. Kaplan provides excellent and extensive reproductions.

That year, 1937, Varo and Peret fled the Civil War and settled in Paris, where Varo became acquainted with Paul Eluard, Andre Breton, Antonin Artaud, Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Leonora Carrington, and other founding spirits of international Surrealism. Varo participated in the International Expositions of Surrealism in 1938 and 1940, but it was not until the late 40s and early 50s in Mexico that she began the paintings for which she is now known. European Surrealism entered Latin America through Mexico: Artaud visited Mexico in 1936, Breton in 1938. Carefully calculating his oxymoron, Breton called Mexico a "naturally surrealist" country. When World War II broke out, travel to Mexico was motivated less by intellectual and aesthetic affinity than by political necessity. Varo and Peret, again forced to flee from war, left Paris for the south of France in 1940 and, after great difficulties in arranging passage, ar- rived in Mexico City at the end of 1941. There they found other European artist refugees; many would stay on beyond the end of the war, and some would establish permanent residency in Mexico- among them the painters Guinther Gerzso, Wolfgang Paalen, Alice Rahon; the film director Luis Bufiuel; the photographer Kati Horna; and the painter and sculptorJose Horna. Varo and the English surre- alist painter Leonora Carrington resumed the friendship they had begun in Paris. In Mexico, they developed a collaborative relation- ship based on their shared spiritualism, and on the affinities of their aesthetic sensibilities and modes of visual expression. The relation- ship proved crucial to the artistic identities of both women. When Varo's marriage to Peret ended in 1947 and Peret returned to Paris, Varo stayed in Mexico. In what is known as her "decada mexicana," the period between 1953 and her untimely death in 1963, she painted the hundred or so paintings upon which her reputation is estab- lished. Beyond the supportive group of artists who surrounded Varo in Mexico, the extent to which Mexican culture (and Latin American culture generally) enabled this Spanish painter to develop and real- ize her artistic vision is a complicated question, but obviously crucial to my comparative discussion. Varo did not resume painting for three years after settling in Mexico, and did not exhibit her work for another nine. During these first dozen years, she worked as a com- mercial artist, a designer of furniture and theater sets, a restorer of pre-Columbian pottery. This work slowed her production of paint- ings, but gave her time to absorb Mexico's cultural and aesthetic am- 115</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE bience and establish her artistic independence from European insti- tutions and authorities, not the least of which may have been the patriarchal character of Surrealism itself. One can only speculate on the effects of that process of accultura- tion, since Varo's work does not explicitly incorporate characteristic Mexican iconographic elements, landscapes, or colors." But I believe she found, as did many other European artists besides Breton, that in Mexico the tenets of Surrealism were not products of an intellectual movement but reflections of popular attitudes and beliefs, not a radi- cal break from the past but a continuous, living tradition. Mexico's rich and often unexpected mixture of indigenous and Christian my- thologies and iconographies, its visible continuity of ancient and modern cultural forms, its implicit cultural valorization of mystery and drama over empiricism and discursive logic, its own particular ratios and relations of public and private, political and psychologi- cal-these were not lost upon European emigres seeking access to irrational modes of mind and matter. Nor were they lost upon artists seeking the visual means to express their discoveries. European real- ism had never been fully transplanted to Latin America, and Latin American visual art forms (especially indigenous and colonial, but also modern) proceeded as often from a conceptual image of the world-a phantasia--as from any supposedly objective observation. It must have seemed to these Europeans that Latin American literature, " The question of the influence of the Latin American cultural context on Varo has not been systematically addressed by her biographers. Chadwick states in passing that "Of all the European Surrealists working in Mexico, [Alice] Rahon appears to be the one most directly influenced by the country's indigenous art, for although Varo was an avid collector of pre-Columbian art, its forms and content play little if any role in her own work and Carrington does not seem to have consciously drawn from this source until the late 1950s" (201). Kaplan cites Varo's statement, "I am more from Mexico than from any other place," but she does not specifically exam- ine the presence of Mexican culture in Varo's art; rather, she limits her discussion to the cultural conditions that facilitated the enthusiastic Mexican reception of the 1940 International Exhibition of [European] Surrealism. Only the Mexican art his- torian Ida Rodriguez Prampolini acknowledges the essential importance and the generalized influence of the Mexican context. She states explicitly about the Spanish Surrealists Kati and Jose Horna: "El ambiente extrafio, la il6gica atm6sfera que rodeaba en Mexico a esta singular pareja frecuentada por los exponentes del grupo surrealista y unida por una entrafiable amistad a Leonora Carrington y Remedios Varo, van Ilevando aJose Horna a buscar la expresividad por la vena fantaistica" (80). In relation to this question, we should compare Varo's early work in Europe to her later work in Mexico. Very little of her early work has been reproduced: "Las almas de los montes" (1938) in Chadwick (216), and "Titeres vegetales" (1938) in Kaplan (62) display considerably less narrative content than Varo's later work, but to gener- alize on the basis of so few early works is useless. Rather, in the course of my discussion, I compare the nature of European Surrealist painting generally to Varo's Mexican paintings, and speculate about the differences. 116</page><page sequence="5">ALLENDE &amp; VARO too, generally preferred the mythical to the empirical: by then, Jorge Luis Borges, the bookish rationalist, had conceived of European phi- losophy and theology as a branch of fantastic literature.4 A few years later, Julio Corta~zar made the axolotl, an ancient amphibian animal indigenous to Mexico, a quintessential literary symbol of the uncon- scious mind. My point here is not to argue for the predominance of the fantastic in recent Latin American art. Such an argument is hardly necessary. Nor do I wish to resolve the issue of Latin America's cultural pres- ence in Varo's art. The debate between formalism and contextualism is necessarily speculative and ongoing with regard to every artist's work, since we cannot know what an artist might have created had he or she been elsewhere. Nonetheless, the Latin American cultural context cannot be dismissed as an issue in the interpretation of Varo's art merely on the grounds that the evidence of it is not explicit in her painted images. I will return to this question in my conclusion; for now, let me say simply that the Hispanic New World provided a cultural environment that nurtured and inspired Varo's fantastic art, as it has more recent artists of the fantastic, including, of course, Isabel Allende. Like Leonora Carrington and her Mexican contemporary, Frida Kahlo, Varo's paintings are of a piece. Recurring or related images, figures, and settings represent her perennial preoccupation with the presence of spiritual realities in the physical world, and with the pro- cess of metamorphosis. Her paintings provide visual metaphors of psychic activity: in them, the physical world is made to interact with, and is ultimately subsumed by, the spiritual world. The mechanical 4 In a book review published in his 1932 collection, Discusi6n, Borges writes: Yo he compilado alguna vez una antologia de la literatura fantastica. Admito que esa obra es de las poquisimas que un segundo Noe deberia salvar de un segundo diluvio, pero delato la culpable omisi6n de los insospechados y mayores maestros del genero: Parmenides, Plat6n,Juan Escoto Erigena, Alberto Magno, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Francis Bradley. En efecto, ?que son los prodigios de Wells o de Edgar Allan Poe-una flor que nos llega del porvenir, un muerto sometido a la hipnosis- confrontados con la invenci6n de Dios, con la teoria laboriosa de un ser que de alguin modo es tres y que solitariamente perdurafuera del tiempo? dQue es la piedra bezoar ante la armonia preestablecida, quidn es el unicornio ante la Trinidad, quien es Lucio Apuleyo ante los multiplicadores de Buddhas del Gran Vehiculo, qu6 son todas las noches de Shahrazad junto a un argumento de Berkeley?

In the same collection, see also Borges's essay, "El arte narrativo y la magia" (81-91); and in Otras inquisiciones, "Nathaniel Hawthorne" (71-95), where Borges selects the most fantastical of Hawthorne's works in order to delineate his personal theory of the predominance of a fantastic tradition in U.S. literature. 117</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE serves, and then transforms into the mystical. This metamorphosis reflects Varo's desire (and that of European Surrealism) to depict psychic realities in terms of natural phenomena and, conversely, to transform the physical landscape according to psychic realities. Varo's idiosyncratic iconography includes fantastical machines that facilitate metaphysical voyages to other shores, other worlds. In sev- eral paintings, the marvelous means of transport springs from the voyager: locks of hair wind out and down to become the handle bars and wheels of minimalist bicycles; hems of dresses reveal not feet but delicate spokes and rims; hats extend into wings, and bodices into waves; capes become sails and shells to convey abstracted visionaries toward mystical destinies. In other paintings, vessels seem to spring from the wondrous world in which the voyager wanders: a musician sails in a mermaid barque, playing her hair like a lyre; a fleet of fabu- lous vessels sails around the spiraling walls of a city to its central tower, where a bird suspended in mid-flight awaits them. Such fantastic voyages and voyagers suggest transmigration and the transfigurative powers invoked by medieval alchemy. Breton, in his second Surrealist Manifesto, called for the "occultation of Surreal- ism," and implied that Surrealism was the latest avatar of the medi- eval hermetic tradition. Varo knew well the tenets and iconography of this tradition, deeply rooted in Spanish medieval thought. Fur- thermore, she was a student of Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Tantrism, and a follower, as was Leonora Carrington, of G.I. Gurdjieff, whose philosophy was based on Sufi mysticism and emphasized the meta- morphic potential of music and dance. The word metamorphosis contains the Greek prefix "meta," which often denotes change and is the same prefix as in the word metaphor. In Varo's paintings, meta- morphosis is a metaphor for the very process of metaphor-that is, for the transformative process of creative activity. The title of Octavio Paz's poetic homage to Varo, "Apariciones y desapariciones de Remedios Varo," calls attention to this recurrent visual metaphor of metamorphosis in Varo's work. To visual metaphors based on these alchemical and mystical sys- tems, Varo's paintings sometimes join images of post-Einsteinian physics. She suggests the mechanical laws by which the world turns, but she also depicts visionary scientists whose activities call into ques- tion the immutability of those mechanical laws. In one painting, a physicist/magician casts a spell upon a globe floating in the air on an axis which, like the room itself, tips precariously to one side. In an- other, Descubrimiento de un ge6logo mutante (1961), both the observer and the world observed appear to be in the process of evolving from 118</page><page sequence="7">ALLENDE &amp; VARO one form to another. Most importantly for my own comparative ar- gument, Varo's female figures routinely move from one state to an- other, emerge from a wall or a tree or the air itself, empowered by and also liberated from the solidity of the material world and corpo- real form. An example is Nacer de nuevo (1960; Fig. 1), in which a figure emerges from a patently vulvar space to find the liquid reflec- tion of a crescent moon-archetypal image of mutability and female fecundity. Varo conveys the impression of momentarily capturing the protean and evanescent qualities of her female figure before she moves or metamorphoses or disappears altogether. Clearly, Varo's principal possessors of transformative energy are women. Whitney Chadwick (190-91) notes that Varo kept a detailed diary and wrote stories, one of which, "Dama Milagra," portrays the intuitive and magical knowledge of women (as opposed to men, whose knowledge is different, and is acquired through study and sci- entific experimentation). In Mt'sica Solar (1955), Armonia (1956), and La creacion de las aves (1958), images of light and music dramatize the spiritual forces her women "scientists" engender and engage. Varo also gives to her women figures the role of satirists of modern sci- ence, particularly those sciences that pretend to transformative functions but are not in touch with the cosmic forces necessary to effect the real transformation of human consciousness. Cirugia pldstica (1960) and Mujer saliendo del psicoanalista (1961) are humorous examples of this satiric vein. Trovador (1959) combines Varo's recog- nizable iconographic embodiments of music, light, and movement, and her characteristic textures and interwoven matrices. In this painting, the troubadour's powers of enchantment may be thrown into question by the gender of his mermaid barque; or, on the con- trary, it may confirm them. Metaphysical female figures often virtually exude from physical surfaces, and in this painting, female figures serve both as the source and the vehicle of his music. The interchange between the physical world and an explicitly female/ metaphysical space is schematized humorously in Mimetismo (1960). A woman is figurally integrated into the material realm, her hands reiterating the carved scrolled arms of the chair upon which she sits, her feet its pointed legs, her skin the design of its upholstery. In turn, the prehensile legs of the chair and the other furniture-the sewing basket, for example-enact explicitly human (and arguably female) activities, grasping things from a drawer, reaching, touching, twining. 119</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Figure 1. Nacer de nuevo.

But Varo's Mimetismo is very different in its suggestion of the transmut- ability of her female figure. This figure exists at once as subject and object in her permeable and transparent world. It would seem, then, that Varo self-consciously reconstrues panthe- ism into panfemism (or panfeminism, if one wishes to recon- textualize Varo's images in contemporary ideological terms, as I will below.) Her mystical women are essentially a single woman whose wide-set eyes, narrow nose and mouth, and long, flowing hair consti- tute a stylized self-portrait. Varo's better-known Mexican contemporary, Frida Kahlo, also painted numerous self-portraits, but Kahlo's self-portraits are more detailed and realistic in their iconic self-representation, and are hence less suggestively symbolic of fe- male principles generally. Varo's figures are not individualized women but archetypes of a creative energy that is conceived and de- picted as fundamentally female. In Isabel Allende's La casa de los espiYitus, this archetypal and funda- mentally female energy is embodied in the author's series of mystical women characters, and it is in these characters that Allende's magical realism converges most explicitly with the surrealistic art of Remedios Varo. Allende was not familiar with Varo's paintings when she wrote her novel, but her spiritual characters and their otherworldly environments are surprisingly similar to Varo's." Though I will eventually argue that their female fantasticks are moti- vated toward essentially different ends, my interartistic comparison will be served in the meantime by some description of the world cre- ated by Allende in La casa de los espizrtus. Like Varo's, Allende's female characters exist simultaneously in worlds that are human and superhuman, rational and beyond rea- son. They are thus sometimes described (as Varo's are depicted) in anthropomorphic terms. Rosa la Bella, the first magical female whom we meet in the novel, has a "maritime" grace: "El tono de su piel, con suaves reflejos azulados, y el de su cabello, la lentitud de sus movimientos y su caricter silencioso, evocaban a un habitante del agua. Tenia algo de pez y si hubiera tenido una cola escamada habria sido claramente una sirena, pero sus dos piernas la colocaban en un limite impreciso entre la criatura humana y el ser mitol6gico" (12). Here, Allende's descriptive technique, as well as what she describes, " Conversation with the author, April 8, 1988, Houston, Texas. 121</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE may easily be linked to Varo's palette and subject matter-in the blu- ish color and light, the ethereal female form, the graceful movement of her anthropomorphic metaphor. As in Varo's art, the mythic and spiritual dimensions of Allende's narrative grow out of a closely ob- served physical reality that is itself translucent, permeable. Beyond their mythic qualities, Allende's characters are analogous to Varo's figures in their invocation of the occult sciences. Allende also opposes alchemy to modern scientific logic, and challenges the cultural hegemony of rationality. Her character Clara, we are told, inhabits a world where "se confundian la verdad prosaica de las cosas materiales con la verdad tumultuosa de los suefios, donde no siempre funcionaban las leyes de la fisica o la 16gica" (78-79). In Varo's paint- ing La llamada (1961; Fig. 2), an astral female figure who holds and wears alchemical instruments might be Clara's emblem. In El hilo (1956; Fig. 3), a ball of thread-archetypal symbol of fate dating back at least to the Moirai, weavers of human destiny in Greek mythology- is held by Varo's visionary, and might serve as the image of Clara's own destiny, her own clairvoyance. Indeed, we might conceive of Varo's female figures collectively as the visual analogues to the ghostly presences-los aparecidos-who animate Clara's house of spir- its. Clara is in contact with her household spirits by means of a magical three-legged table. Three "translucent" women-the Mora sisters who, like the Moirai, are the very incarnations of fate-advise Clara of the table's telepathic power, which they ascertain in a visual image: eran las finicas que tenian la prueba irrefutable de que las a'nimas pueden materializarse, gracias a una fotografia que las mostraba alrededor de una mesa y volando por encima de sus cabezas a un ectoplasma difuso y alado, que algunos descreidos atribufan a una mancha en el revelado del retrato y otros a un simple engafio del fot6grafo (115). The table is the agency by which phantasias are made visible, and the narrator's matter-of-fact report of the winged ectoplasm and the ma- terialist explanations of the "unbelievers" only serves to emphasize Clara's unshakable belief in the reality of the spirits, and in the imag- ing/imaginative capacities of her table. Clara's table also serves as the iconic link between spirituality and domesticity: the four-legged family dining table, locus of physical and familiar nourishment, set and presided over by the matriarch, is closely associated with (and sometimes is magically transformed into) Clara's three-legged table. So, Allende suggests, the cosmic and the quotidian are interwoven in this house of spirits. In fact, all of Allende's women characters depend on symbolic 122</page><page sequence="11">ALLENDE &amp; VARO Figure 2. La lamada.

Even Blanca, the most rational of all the Trueba women, refers to the knowledge she has gained at her mother's table in order to distinguish between appearance and real- ity. She realizes that her husband, Jean de Satigny, is not what meets 123</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Figure 3. El hilo.

Despite her common sense, which for more than twenty years has caused her to resist "the dance of the three-legged table," she eventually yields to its movements and her own intuition, and enters Jean's photographic studio to discover the true nature of his activities. Hidden phantasias are made visible by means of the in- sights acquired around Clara's kinetic table. 124</page><page sequence="13">ALLENDE &amp; VARO Figure 4. Naturaleza muerta resucitando. Reproduced by permission of Walter Gruen. Again, we find a visual analogue to Allende's verbal art in a paint- ing by Remedios Varo. Varo's spinning table in Naturaleza muerta resucitando (1963; Fig. 4) is clearly animated by the same cosmic en- ergy as Clara's table, and may serve as another tangible symbol, along with the thread of Varo's El hilo, of Clara's clairvoyance. 125</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE In La casa de los espiritus Isabel Allende describes a painted portrait of Clara, which now hangs in a London museum. The portrait shows a middle-aged woman sitting in a rocking chair that floats in the air amidst blowing curtains and suspended objects, with a fat black cat observing the scene: "Influencia de Chagall, dice el catalogo de museo, pero no es asi. Corresponde exactamente a la realidad que el artista vivi6 en la casa de Clara" (237). Like Varo, Allende dissociates her creativity (and her creations) from their European patriarchal precursors, and insists instead on a context that is local (Latin Ameri- can), and domestic (female). When we are told that over the years, a group of spiritualists gathers around Clara and the Mora sisters, we may allow ourselves the meta-fantasy of seeing Remedios Varo among that group, painting the portrait of Clara, and the fantastical archi- tecture of the house as well. Beyond these similarities to Varo's images, I would propose that Allende fosters the reader's experience of seeing (in the visionary, as well as the visual sense) by making self-conscious metaphoric and structural use of color, line, shape, mass, texture, light-the semiotic tools, so to speak, of the painter. Indeed, the narrator of the novel refers to the narration itself in spatial terms: Alba characterizes her story as "una cadena de palabras luminosas" (234) and "un rompecabezas en el que cada pieza tiene una ubicaci6n precisa" (379). She also refers to the political fate of the characters-the im- pelling motive of her narration-as a "dibujo" which was laid down before her birth. Using the torturer, Esteban Garcia, to epitomize this intuition, she writes, "Es un trazo tosco y torcido, pero ninguna pincelada es inuitil" (379). This metaphor should not surprise us, for Alba is, we may have forgotten, a painter: as a child, she is given a box filled with paints, brushes, a small ladder, and permission to paint on the walls of her bedroom. Over time, she fills them entirely: "en medio de una flora venusiana y una fauna imposible de bestias inventadas, como las que bordaba Rosa en su mantel y cocinaba Blanca en su horno de cerimica, aparecieron los deseos, los re- cuerdos, las tristezas y las alegrias de su nifiez" (240). That Alba's painted fresco will serve as a metaphor for the narrative she later con- structs is confirmed when she meets her father, the revolutionary Pedro Tercero, for the first time; we are told that she immediately places him in "la categoria de los seres que merecian ser pintados en el fresco gigantesco de su habitaci6n" (246). So we are reminded that Alba, with her panoramic painting, is part of a line of artists- Rosa and Blanca before her-who embody feeling in visual form. The origin of this visionary lineage is crucially linked to seeing. As 126</page><page sequence="15">ALLENDE &amp; VARO a child, Clara does not speak, or feel the need for language, for nine years. Her muteness begins after she witnesses the sexual violation of Rosa's corpse by Dr. Cuevas's assistant: laid out on the family's kitchen table, Rosa is an eroticized spectacle. The oppressive power of the male gaze has been discussed by a number of feminist theo- rists. Luce Irigaray, for example, asserts: "Investment in the look is not privileged in women as in men. More than the other senses, the eye objectifies and masters."' But here, the male gaze is both recog- nized and subverted: Clara also gazes, through the kitchen window, and sees what Irigaray would call the assistant's commodity fetishism. As a result, Clara begins her own very different "visionary tasks": from that moment on, "seeing" is for her a means of transcending the ob- jectifications and projections that her culture imposes upon women. Her creation of an expressly female realm is subversive, of course, and her domineering husband Esteban knows it. He throws his sister Ferula out of the house because he is jealous of her relationship with Clara, naively believing that it keeps Clara from loving him com- pletely. Years later, the aging but still-intransigent Esteban drills a hole in the bathroom wall to spy on her, but the reader knows before- hand that his voyeurism-and his lifelong enterprise of domination-will fail. Esteban's viewpoint reinforces his physical and psychological separation from Clara: his peephole reiterates the monologic/ monofocal nature of his vision and his power, and con- trasts radically with the comprehensive vistas of Alba's frescoes and Clara's apariciones. Esteban seals up his peephole and immediately notices that his own body is shrinking, a narrative juxtaposition that confirms my interpretation of these passages in terms of the politics of gender and visual possession. With the exception of Rosa (and perhaps because of her), Allende's female characters are able to re- sist objectification by the male gaze. They are resolute subjects who produce their own meaning, their own selves. There is much more to be said about the politics of seeing in this novel, but I will leave the development of this discussion to other critics and focus instead on the interartistic significance of this scene. It seems clear to me that Allende implies a preference for the signify- ing capacities and energies of spatial/visual structures. Clara's childhood lack of language can be understood as initiating and facili- tating her construction of a female consciousness that is primarily 6 Quoted in Owens 70. Irigaray's exploration of the relation between commodity fetishism and women in a patriarchal society is relevant to Allende's novel.

During her muteness, she lives in a world described as a "caleidoscopio de espejos," (78) where she is "accompafiada por los espiritus del aire, del agua y de la tierra" (79). Her wordless world is as visually multifarious as the paintings that Alba will later create upon her walls. In the silence of her visions, "el tiempo no se marcaba con relojes ni calendarios y . . . los objetos tenian vida propia, los aparecidos se sentaban en la mesa y hablaban con los humanos, el pasado y el futuro eran parte de la misma cosa ... " (78). The spatial metaphor of the kaleidoscope, linked as it is to Clara's mute conversations with los aparecidos (literally, those who appear) seems calculated by Allende to emphasize yet again the visual claims of her character's phantasias. And Alba, making a final reference to her grandmother Clara's notebooks, the source of her own narrative, speaks in terms of space and sight. We are told that the young Clara does in fact record her silent visions in words in order that she may "ver las cosas en su dimensi6n real" (379). Like the three Mora sisters who, Alba says, could see the spirits of all eras mingled in space, Clara in her notebooks, Alba in her narrative, and Allende in her novel self- consciously eschew the linear temporality of verbal narration-"la ficci6n del tiempo, en el presente, el pasado y el futuro," as Alba puts it-to create structures that strive for the simultaneity and immediacy of a spatial/visual mode. The explicit visual orientation of this novel's descriptive strategies is hardly new. The narrative rebellion against the discursive struc- tures of language was already in full force in European literature by the end of the second decade of this century: Imagists, Futurists, Cub- ists, Vorticists, Expressionists, and Surrealists aimed to break the boundaries between visual and verbal art, between synchronic and diachronic expression, by means of montage, juxtaposition, free as- sociation, automatic writing, and so on. And certainly many recent Latin American fiction writers avail themselves of spatializing narra- tive strategies.7 T.S. Eliot provided one of the first theoretical discussions of spatial structuring in fictional narration. In his influ- ential review, "Ulysses, Order and Myth," written in 1923 to defend Joyce's masterpiece against contemporary critical charges of form- lessness, Eliot coins the phrase "mythological method" to support his case. He argues thatJoyce uses this method, instead of the "narrative method," as the means of ordering the "immense panorama of futil- 7 I discuss spatial form in Latin American fiction in "Voyeur/Voyant" and "Euro- pean Intertextuality in Vargas Llosa and Cortizar. 128</page><page sequence="17">ALLENDE &amp; VARO ity and anarchy" of the modern world that Ulysses aspires to present. The mythological method "discovered" byJoyce, as Eliot puts it, im- plies the creation of a grid upon which the author locates "living material"-objects, events, settings-"and the emotions and feeling of the writer himself . . "(177). It allows Joyce to integrate into his temporal narrative medium a mythic dimension where past, present, and future do not apply.8 Eliot's spatial concept is, of course, a metaphor for the complex narrative structure of Ulysses, for words deployed on the printed page. But it nonetheless begins to suggest my own theoretical approach to the visual (and visualizing) capacities of Varo and Allende. Literary theorists have recently extended and modified literary critical mod- els to include the "reading" of painted "texts." Prominent among such studies are Norman Bryson's Vision and Painting, Wendy Steiner's The Colors of Rhetoric and Pictures of Romance, and W.J.T. Mitchell's Iconology. I will reverse their procedure, however, and (fol- lowing Eliot) apply a spatial model to a literary text. Rudolph Arnheim, like Eliot, invokes the idea of the grid. Arnheim argues that every work of visual art is conditioned by two spatial systems, one parochial, the other cosmic. In the parochial system, shapes are controlled by an invisible, non-hierarchical right- angled grid of verticals and horizontals. In the cosmic system, shapes are controlled by the power of an internal center which, unlike the parochial system, does engender a visual hierarchy, from the central point outward. Both systems are necessary to organize the visual space of the painting. Arnheim states, "The interaction between the two spatial systems generates formally the complexity of shape, color, and movement that our visual sense cherishes; and it represents sym- bolically the relation between the cosmic perfection of which any thing or creature possesses a little and the struggle between down- ward pull and upward striving that marks the drama of our earthly behavior" (x). Arnheim's paradigm might initially appear to depend on binarisms that would limit or even betray interpretation of Varo's vi- sionary paintings. However, the dualisms of his compositional model are proposed not as oppositional or mutually exclusive but rather as existing simultaneously and in creative tension within a given compo- sition. His categories allow us to consider the ways in which Varo's geometrical spaces transcend the very enclosures upon which their 8 The seminal critical essay on literary spatialization is by Joseph Frank; another important early essay on the subject is that of Walter Sutton. 129</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE composition depends. Varo's imaginary spaces are filled with geometrically patterned forms and furnishings-arches, corridors, steps, fountains, towers. Their exaggerated artifice-they are, after all, structures that could never stand-creates the impression of painted theatrical backdrops or stage sets. Consider in terms of Arnheim's system the grids and centric structures of Varo's painting Nacer de nuevo (Fig. 1). On the floor, the intersecting lines of tiles, table legs, walls, create oblique and right angles; on the table, its central point, a bowl contains a luminous semi-circle, a crescent moon that shines down through a hole in the ceiling and reflects back up again into open space. Aligned with the central vertical of this painting, just to the right of center, is the head and body of a woman who emerges through a wall that opens in symbolically female form, as if to suggest the figure's rebirth by means of and though her gender. She is both witness to and symbolic source of the cosmic force generated by the painting's centric system-eyes, breasts, table, bowl, moon. In La llamada (Fig. 2) and El hilo (Fig. 3), the disposition of arche- typal figures in their measured architectural medium also lends itself to interpretation via Arnheim's structural model. In El hilo, the ball of thread is the cosmic center of the painting, its off-centeredness to the left counterbalanced by the circle of vegetation on the rug to the right, and also by the series of symmetrical arches within the male figure's body. The arches both point toward the center and fade away from it, receding into the distance and the destiny that the woman pulls back again to the center of the painting and onto her ball of thread. The sibylline power of Varo's female figure emanates from this complex structural tension of circles and lines as surely as it does from her abstracted eyes, or from the absence of eyes of the figure whose destiny she controls. Both exist in Varo's typically gran- diloquent space: here, as in many of her paintings, visual hyperreality creates a surreal environment. The walls, door, mirror, fireplace, wainscoting, exist in two dimensions, all points and lines and angles. The arc and volume of the billowing draperies serve to emphasize the planar surfaces of the house's interior, and also to sug- gest a world exterior to the house, an eventual and contingent world where the wind blows and grass and moss grow through the cracks. I will return to this intriguing duality of times and spaces in the last section of my essay. The final painting I want to discuss in Arnheim's terms is in fact the last one that Varo created-her only known work without a human or an animal figure. Naturaleza muerta resucitando (Fig. 4) yields easily to 130</page><page sequence="19">ALLENDE &amp; VARO Arnheim's thesis. The strong vertical axes and intersecting radials on the floor and table cloth in this work lead to the dramatized center point of the composition. The painting is first of all a visual pun, a visual image that plays on words: it is an unstill still life, a "naturaleza muerta" revivifying. The whirling table spins around a cosmic center, a center that is reiterated by the circles expanding outward concen- trically from it. Centrifugal force sends planetary fruit and flying saucers into orbit: on the left, a pomegranate (symbol of fertility and eternity in medieval Jewish and Christian iconography) bursts; on the right, other fruits collide, their seeds falling to earth like meteorites. The table's cosmic energy threatens momentarily to destroy the most basic grid of the parochial system, the canvas itself, by flying out of the very frame that contains it. But seeds of regeneration are sown by this destruction, and take root and sprout on the gridded floor. Ap- plying Arnheim's terms to this painting, we see that the cosmic force of the centric system is potentially destructive, but we also under- stand that it possesses the power to regenerate the parochial system upon which Varo's imaginary space is deployed. Within the parochial system of any painting or sculpture, Arnheim recognizes further spatial elements that exist in creative tension, par- ticularly on the vertical axis. I have quoted his observation on the downward pull of gravity and the upward striving of the human spirit. Naturaleza muerta resucitando simultaneously emphasizes and over- comes the physical limitations of spatial existence that Arnheim ad- dresses. Gravity is both defied and reasserted, by the table and also by the insects that fly overhead. The table manages to remain upright, and the insects momentarily elude both the downward pull of the vertical axis and the outward thrust of the center. But the fragility of their flight and of their freedom, like the precarious balance of the spinning table, only emphasizes the forces and vectors which are oth- erwise everywhere visible. Varo revises the binarisms of physical/ spiritual, body/mind by creating a metaphysical geometry in which both physical and spiritual realities are inscribed and operative. Arnheim's spatial model is applicable to Varo's paintings, but can it also be profitably applied to Allende's narrative art? The applica- tion will necessarily be speculative, because Arnheim is theorizing about visual structures, not verbal ones. Nonetheless, let us inquire into what might correspond to the parochial and cosmic systems in a novel, La casa de los espiritus. Might we say that the narrative structure corresponds to the gridded parochial system (as Eliot essentially pro- posed of Ulysses), and reserve aspects of the novel's thematic content for Arnheim's centric cosmic system? No, because Arnheim clearly 131</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE finds the two spatial systems operating in both the structure and the content of the work of visual art. Here instead, let me propose that the recurring image of Clara's three-legged table is the cosmic center of the grid (the parochial system) that is the novel as a whole. I would suggest that Allende's novel deploys its densely detailed narrative elements on a conceptual grid of intersecting axes running horizontally (this axis might be conceived as those realistic elements of plot, setting, causal sequence), and vertically (here, narrative ele- ments that allude to pre-existing mythic systems-among them Sufi teachings, alchemy, Gurdjieff, the Greek Moirai, Neruda's poetry, Garcia MaIrquez's fiction, theoretical physics-and perhaps also the spirits who exist beyond time and reason in Clara's house). These horizontal and vertical axes would constitute the novel's parochial system-though I am tempted to unsettle Arnheim's rectilinear con- struct by conceptualizing Allende's narrative space as an intertwining network or matrix, a labyrinth with short cuts and tangents and fork- ing paths, or as the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope of mirrors to which the narrator compares Clara's world. The novel's centric fo- cus-its cosmic system-is thematically and structurally located, I would hypothesize, in the recurring narrative image of Clara's three- legged table. We remember that Clara's table exists at the very center of her house, and is the medium that connects the house and its in- habitants to the spiritual world. It is thus the structural center of the imaginative space created by the novel, as well as its central narrative image and its thematic center. Like Varo's painted table, the move- ments of Allende's verbal table have undeniable cosmic significance. If we entertain this conceptual and critical leap for a moment, we may observe that the cosmic system symbolically centered in Clara's table and the parochial system of political and social realities do in- deed exist in tension, as Arnheim asserts they must. The reader, like Clara, constantly senses the conflict between her vision of cosmic har- mony and the catastrophic events which the narrative sets forth. Unlike Varo's painting, where that tension creates a fragile but ten- able balance (witness the insects, the rooted seeds), Allende's novel is less sanguine. Though the narrator tells us that Clara tries to main- tain "el delicado equilibrio . .. entre los espiritus de Mals Alla y las almas necesitadas del Mas Aca" (148), she ultimately recognizes that a balance is impossible: "De nada le [sirvio] la mesa de tres patas ... frente a la urgencia de defender a los inquilinos de la peste y el desconcierto, a la tierra de la sequia y el caracol, alas vacas de la fiebre aftosa, a las gallinas del moquillo, a la ropa de la polilla, a sus hijos del abandono y a su esposo de la muerte y de su propia incontenible ira. 132</page><page sequence="21">ALLENDE &amp; VARO Clara estaba muy cansada" (148). The welter of phenomenal particu- lars in this sentence, like so many others in the novel, occupies its part on the grid where Allende arranges the multiplying vicissitudes that will, before the novel ends, include torture and murder. The grid in its entirety is, of course, the novel itself-an "immense pan- orama of futility and anarchy," to repeat the spatial image that Eliot used to describe Ulysses. The "downward pull" of events-now I re- peat Arnheim's phrase-threatens eventually to overwhelm whatever cosmic perfection Clara's round table might conjure. My discussion of the spatial nature of Allende's novel must remain metaphoric, as did Eliot's of Ulysses, because Arnheim's theory refers specifically to the visual space of the painting, not to the visual space of the printed page or the imaginary space that fiction creates in the mind's eye. But I find his theory useful because it allows the critic to address the power of Allende's text as a text, that is, as a formal aes- thetic construct, as well as a reflection of and upon human experience. Furthermore, it serves to underline what I have de- scribed as the novel's thematic and structural striving toward visual form. Indeed, analytical models such as Arnheim's that emphasize spatial structures and relations within literary texts may prove par- ticularly suggestive when applied to women's writing.9 Feminist critics have repeatedly stressed women's displacement by language- medium of patriarchal power, embodiment of patriarchal cul- ture-and the necessity of creating a space beyond the dominant or- der from/in which to operate. This "female space" has been called the "wild zone" by the anthropologist Edwin Ardener (3), and his term-and related ones-has been widely adopted.1' Ardener dia- grams male ("dominant") and female ("muted") cultures as eccentric circles that overlap but do not coincide. Whereas the male circle represents the dominant culture and is thus wholly accessible to and structured by language, the crescent of the female circle out- 9 Elaine Showalter asserts that "the concepts of perception, silence and silencing are ... central to discussions of women's participation in literary culture" (261). 10 Showalter describes the metaphorical extensions of this spatial metaphor: "For some feminist critics, the wild zone, or 'female space,' must be the address of a genu- inely women-centered criticism, theory, and art, whose shared project is to bring into being the symbolic weight of female consciousness, to make the invisible visible, to make the silent speak. French feminist critics would like to make the wild zone the theoretical base of women's difference. In their texts, the wild zone becomes the place for the revolutionary women's language, the language of everything that is repressed, for the revolutionary women's writing in 'white ink.' It is the Dark Conti- nent in which Cixous's laughing Medusa and Wittig's guirilleres [sic] reside. Through voluntary entry into the wild zone, other feminist critics tell us, a woman can write her way out of the 'cramped confines of patriarchal space"(263). 133</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE side the dominant order is imaginary, symbolic, silent. It is no-man's- land, a space foreign to mainstream male culture which, according to Ardener, must find symbolic expression through ritual and art. My point is not to relate Ardener's spatial model to Arnheim's, or to elaborate its obvious relevance to Clara's childhood muteness or the silent spirits that inhabit her house, or Alba's global narration, or any of the other spatial metaphors to which I have referred. Rather, I want to call attention to the intersection of Ardener's feminist theory and Arnheim's art criticism at the very point where they invoke spa- tial structures to discuss consciousness, culture, texts. This intersection has encouraged my own brief excursion into the hypo- thetical space of Allende's text, but it awaits further, more deliberate crossings by feminists and psychologists of art together. Arnheim's spatial model also leads me to an essential difference between Varo's table and Allende's, and to what is perhaps the essen- tial difference between European Surrealism and Latin American magic realism as well. Varo's fantastical images are principally con- ceived to depict psychological and spiritual realities, and thus to address the nature of the self and the soul, whereas Allende's are grounded in communal and political and social realities, and are in- tended to communicate the writer's objection to those realities. European Surrealist art is characterized not by specific political refer- ence but by images that aspire to the status of archetype, and Varo's female figures do indeed reflect their European lineage on this point." They are Everywoman, and their isolation in (and from) their specific surroundings seems to confirm that fact. Varo's Everywoman is alone, and even when she is not, she does not con- verse with or look at the others. Her struggle to free herself from material entrapments and cultural encumbrances is private and spiri- tual, not public or political. Like Varo's paintings, Allende's novel is allegorical and archetypal, but her archetypes point to particular events and people in recent history as Varo's paintings do not. There is never any doubt about the men whom Allende's Poet, Candidate, and President represent, or about the time and place that are the subject of her political alle- gory. Even Clara, Blanca, and Alba are given actual historical refer- ents in the epigraph of the novel. In short, Allende's table is point- edly subversive in ways that Varo's is not, though I would (again) urge " Estella Lauter discusses Varo's work in terms of Jungian archetypes, which she defines as the human tendency to form images that express recurrent or widely shared experience. See her "Visual Images by Women" especially Chapter 4, "Remedios Varo: The Creative Woman and the Female Quest" (79-97). 134</page><page sequence="23">ALLENDE &amp; VARO further, more detailed comparative and interartistic discussion- here, of the differences between the Latin American political impera- tives to which Allende's contemporary magical realist text responds, as against the impulse to cultural subversion obeyed by the European Surrealists of Varo's time. In both cases, but in different ways, the fantastic has served as a liberational mode. My assertion that Varo's work does not aim to embody specific po- litical situations or subjects is relevant to the artist's own historical context, and to her view of her artistic concerns as essentially psycho- logical and spiritual. It is impossible, however, to ignore the ways in which Varo's work has become political as our own cultural context has evolved, and more specifically, as feminist critics have addressed the artistic modes and spaces by and in which women are determined and depicted. If La casa de los espiritus is the work of an avowed femi- nist (and Allende's subsequent novels, De amory de sombra [1984] and Eva Luna [1987], also project explicit feminist concerns), Varo was a spiritualist with a deep understanding of female modes of knowledge and expression. She depicted women's creative and intuitive powers before the "feminine mystique" was conceived as an issue of cultural politics. Though her paintings repeatedly address the nature of woman's quest for freedom and fulfillment in ways that now seem to constitute a quintessential feminist statement, Varo herself could hardly have conceived them as such, or ideologized them as we now may. For viewers in the 1990s, Varo's Everywoman combines the mys- tical and the political in proportions decidedly different from those of a quarter of a century and more ago. I earlier raised the unanswerable question of the role of the Latin American cultural environment in Varo's artistic achievement, and I want to conclude by returning to that question. I have linked Varo to European Surrealism, as do the art critics who discuss her work, and as she did herself. This is understandable, but it is equally important to understand that Varo's work departed from European Surrealism in several important respects, including Surrealism's fundamental aesthetic investment in psychic automism. Recall Breton's declara- tion in his first Surrealist Manifesto that the most effective image is the most arbitrary one, and Louis Aragon's emphasis, in Le paysan de Paris (1926), on the automatic sources, hence the necessary disorder, of the Surrealist image.'2 While Varo shared with these Surrealists a deep interest in areas and activities beyond rational control, her paintings do not use automatic associations or arbitrary juxtaposi- tions to evoke them. I do not mean to reduce European Surrealism 12 Rodriguez Prampolini cites Breton as saying, "La imagen mas fuerte es la que 135</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE to these ideas of Breton and Aragon; my point here is that the fantas- tic content of Varo's paintings never stems from the arbitrariness of her images but, on the contrary, from their narrative content. She evokes the unknowable by visualizing archetypal narrative situations and portraying archetypal actors in those situations. There is almost always an implicit "before" and "after" to the arrested moment of the painted scene, a potential plot based on a set of causal associations that may be reconstructed from the depicted image.'" The mystical voyage, painted repeatedly, is the most basic of Varo's narratives, but by no means the only one: unfolding stories of creation and transfor- mation and liberation abound in her work, as I have already said. Her triptych, Bordando el manto terrestre, is an obvious example-a three-part painting has narrative potential as a single painting does not-but Varo's single paintings can also be "read" by their viewers for the related stories that they tell. Varo's visual narrativity gives her paintings an internal coherence and causal structure suggestive of an occulted order beyond the visible, rather than the utter lack of such an order urged by Breton and Aragon. It is significant that Varo arrived in Mexico at the time when Rivera, Orozco, O'Gorman, Soriano, Kahlo, Rodriguez Lozano, An- tonio Ruiz, and others (having experienced and assimilated the energies of European Surrealism) were creating visual modes of tell- ing stories-about Mexican history, society, the Mexican self. Varo's paintings are very far from Rivera's murals, Kahlo's autobiographical ex-votos, Soriano's popular allegories or Ruiz's ritual tableaux. None- theless, I would propose that her narrative impulse was nurtured and encouraged in this Mexican artistic ambience as it might not have been in Europe, where narrativity in painting had by the late forties been virtually eclipsed by the prevailing preference for abstraction.14 In this regard we may consider that Varo, like the Mexican painters I have just named, extended one of the signifying possibilities devel- oped by Surrealist artists earlier in the century. I am thinking of the mythological motifs and dreams depicted by Ernst and Brauner, with presenta el mayor grado de arbitrariedad, no lo oculto," an assertion that is hardly applicable to Varo; and she cites Aragon as saying, "el vicio llamado surrealista es el empleo desordenado y pasional de la estupefaciente imagen," a statement that also differs from Varo's work in both substance and spirit (76). s' Arnheim relates the temporal content of the painted images to his posited paro- chial and cosmic systems in the final chapter of The Power of the Center, "Persistence in Time" (209-14). 14 For a historical perspective on the question of narrativity in the visual arts, see Wendy Steiner, Chapters I and VI. 136</page><page sequence="25">ALLENDE &amp; VARO their emphasis on memory and return; the spare visual parables of Klee; the inverted or subverted narrative sequences in some of Magritte's and Delvaux's figures and scenes; Dali's work in the late 20s and early 30s; and much of the work of women Surrealists-Fini, Sage, Tanning, Carrington. This is Surrealist art in which narrative potential does in fact inhere, and Varo shares their impulse to arche- typal narrative imaging. But unlike Magritte, Ernst, Delvaux, and Dali, Varo moves the representation of women beyond socially con- structed images of objectified desire, to tell a quite different story. I am aware of the danger of creating overly-simplified oppositions between European and Mexican aesthetics, narrative and non-narra- tive art, male and female artistic production. However, the Surrealist vein of visual narrativity was largely exhausted in Europe by the time Varo began to realize her own creative powers in Mexico, and her distance from Europe may have freed her to reject the reigning ab- stract formalism of her own time, to pursue (and also, in some sense, preserve) this earlier vein of Surrealism. I argued that Isabel Allende uses metaphors and methods from the visual arts to challenge the constrictions of language and narrative form; now I would propose, conversely, that Varo discovered in the temporal and causal structures of narrative a means of containing and controlling the seemingly limitless abstraction of the prevailing European formalism. Surely this was a discovery influenced, and per- haps even made possible, by her residence in Mexico. Octavio Paz, in "Apariciones y desapariciones de Remedios Varo," acknowledges the complexity of Varo's visualized narratives: Raices, follajes, rayos astrales, cabellos, pelos de la barba, espirales del sonido: hilos de muerte, hilos de vida, hilos de tiempo. La trama se teje y desteje: irreal lo que llamamos vida, irreal lo que llamamos muerte-s6lo es real la tela. Remedios antiparca. Maquinas de la fantasia contra el furor mecanico, la fantasia maquinal. No pinta el tiempo sino los instantes en que el tiempo reposa. En su mundo de relojes parados oimos el fluir de las sustancias, la circulaci6n de la sombra y la luz: el tiempo madura. Nos sorprende porque pinta sorprendida. (51) Paz's image "hilos de tiempo," his phrase "el tiempo madura," and his word "trama" are suggestive here, for they address the narrative potential inherent in Varo's visual art. Paz plays with the contradic- tion of narrative movement in the motionless spatial medium of painting: Varo's threads, strands, fronds, astral rays may be under- stood as symbolizing the linear unfolding of her mystical stories, as 137</page><page sequence="26">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE well as representing the intricate spatial designs of nature. Paz con- cludes his poetic commentary on Varo's paintings by evoking the cre- ative volatility of their forms: "Las formas buscan su forma, la forma busca su disoluci6n." Varo's fantastic art depends upon the subtle shiftings and superpositions of spatial and narrative forms, as does the magical realism of Allende. Paz's emphasis on Varo's representation of nature as dense, sinu- ous, flowing, suggests another distinction between her paintings and European surrealism generally. The vital organicism of her painted world departs notably from the sterile world of much European Sur- realist art, a departure that seems to owe something essential to the Mexican natural environment and to its representations (indigenous and Hispanic). Vines sprout from furniture, roots reach through floors, bark and moss grow on walls, birds nest in chair backs, forests and rivers and oceans proliferate on/in human bodies or engulf them from behind. I have said that Varo's geometrical interior in El hilo (Fig. 3) resembles a theatrical backdrop or stage set, but the organicism of the vegetation counterbalances the studied artifice of the planar surfaces, and in fact recalls the natural forces that beset and eventually overtake Clara's decaying house of spirits. The moss hanging from ceiling and walls, the plants growing in the rug, are reminiscent of several fictional Latin American houses that fall be- fore the forces of invading nature-the Buendia house in Garcia M~rquez's Cien aios de soledad and the dictator's palace in El otoiio del patriarca, the Olmos Acevedo house in Sabato's Sobre heroes y tumbas, the Ventura house in Donoso's Casa de campo, the mansions-turned- tenements in Mexico City in Fuentes's short story, "Estos fueron los palacios." Varo's portrayal of the tenacious fecundity of nature, set in visual opposition to the decay of human artifacts, parallels a preva- lent strain of verbal imagery in Latin American narrative that goes back to the mid-nineteenth century and before. I would build one final conceptual bridge between Varo's surreal- ist art and her Latin American cultural context, a bridge that is significant to our understanding of Allende's magical realism as well. I have already discussed the highly structured composition of Varo's paintings. Less clear in printed reproductions is the intricate tracery of almost-transparent pigment that she often superimposed upon the more solid geometry of her darker backgrounds. A lacy brushwork texture of hair and feathers, branches and bark, rays of light and misty, astral air shimmer above or in front of her architectonic spaces. By blowing thinned paint on the surface of her canvas, or by blotting pools of thickened paint, she created the textural illusion of 138</page><page sequence="27">ALLENDE &amp; VARO mist and moss and circumambient air. These modes of applying paint were adapted from the Surrealist practice of decalcomania, but whereas for the Surrealists decalcomania was an automatist technique used for producing chance configurations, for Varo it was a means of creating surface details to enhance her carefully delineated images (Kaplan 122, 128). Our awareness of the control and coherence of Varo's spaces may also be influenced by their smallness (her paint- ings are rarely more than eighty centimeters on a side, often less than forty, and are occasionally oval or round or diamond-shaped), and by the precision of line allowed by masonite, her preferred surface. Varo's impulse to fracture, then fill, the surfaces of her visual space may be usefully linked to the style increasingly labeled by art histori- ans as New World Baroque, Barroco de Indias, or Neo-Baroque.15 An essay on the Latin American Baroque by the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier is relevant to our discussion of Varo's visual composition, and to our speculations about the interplay of fantastic art and Latin American culture.16 In "Lo barroco y lo real maravilloso," Carpentier rejects the idea that the Baroque style flourished only during the period usually des- ignated by historians of European art.17 On the contrary, he asserts that the Baroque forms imported into Latin America by European colonizers coincided with and continued ancient indigenous forms. Carpentier writes that the Baroque "se manifiesta donde hay transformaci6n, mutacion, innovaci6n" (123): his examples include the sculpted stone facades at the indigenous Mexican sites of 15 The seminal art-historical study of the Baroque aesthetic imported into and im- posed upon New World forms by the Spanish Crown and Church in their vast archi- tecture, art, literature is Pal Kelemen's; recent discussions of this style in literature are byJulio Ortega and Severo Sarduy. 16 Carpentier was closely associated with Breton and the Surrealist movement in the '20s and '30s in Europe, but broke with that movement as he developed his theory of the special nature of the American fantastic-lo real maravilloso americano-- a phrase often loosely translated as magic realism. For a history of the relationship between Carpentier's conception of Latin American magic realism and European Surrealism, see Gonzalez Echevarria 56-66 and 123-29. 17 This essay is based upon and develops Carpentier's famous 1948 essay, "De lo real maravilloso americano." Carlos Fuentes describes the New World Baroque in terms similar to Carpentier's. His definition of the Baroque is specifically relevant to Varo's visual composition: "una visi6n circular, excentrica, en la que los volfimenes escult6ricas, el juego de luces y sombras, el contraste de plenitudes y vacios, la aventura de las lineas, obligan a un desplazamiento del espectador, que s61o puede ver la obra si ocupa espacios diversos: cada movimiento crea un espacio nuevo y, de cierta manera, crea una nueva obra. El arte barroco supone una trans-figuraci6n permanente (255-56.) 139</page><page sequence="28">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Teotihuacan and Mitla, the plateresque facade of the church in Tepoztlan, the glazed geometry of the polychrome tiled dome on the church of San Francisco de Ecatepec near Cholula, the intertwining high reliefs of the Rosario Chapel in Puebla, the drbol de la vida on the ceiling of the church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca. These works of art and architecture use both straight and curved lines in series of "focos proliferantes que se prolongan al infinito" (118). Indeed, Carpentier notes that the early colonial churches were baroque to the second power, for the Indians who were obliged to build them infused into the European designs the subtle influences of their own baroque monumental and pictorial art. It is, in fact, this creative cul- tural mixing that Carpentier celebrates in his essay. He asks: "?Ypor que es America Latina la tierra de elecci6n del barroco? Porque toda simbiosis, todo mestizaje, engendra un barroquismo. El barroquismo americano se acrece con ... la conciencia de ser otra cosa, de ser una cosa nueva, de ser una simbiosis, de ser un criollo; y el espiritu criollo de por si, es un espiritu barroco" (126). Carpentier's culminating example of the New World Baroque is the sculpted stone statue of Coatlicue, the Aztec Great Mother goddess, eclectic in form, sources, and mythological significance. Here I would add the innumerable representations of pre-Hispanic goddesses in polychrome ceramics and polished onyx, alabaster, mother-of-pearl. Coatlicue is just one of the inhabitants of Mexico's house of spirits, one of its many images of otherness in the form of woman. Clearly Carpentier intends to amplify the usual definition of Baroque, a definition circumscribed by European rather than Ameri- can practice. He does not describe an artistic space merely (or necessarily) charged to surfeit with elaborate ornamentation, or a space that uses curved lines exclusively. Rather, he refers to an art that encloses space without imprisoning it, that encodes it in imagi- native forms to reflect telluric realities. While we will do well, I think, to reject the term Baroque to describe the paintings of Remedios Varo, we nonetheless recognize in Carpentier's descriptions essential elements of her style: her circumscription of visual space, even as she portrays her female figures' liberation from that space; the plasticity, both narrative and kinetic, of her painted figures and space; the pro- liferation of her natural images-plants, birds, animals, water; her sinuous landscapes, which exist in tension with the linearity of her artifacts and architecture; her use of light, shadow, color to create spatial volumes that are both opaque and diaphanous. Thus, where Whitney Chadwick suggests a comparison of Varo's spaces to de Chirico's, I would insist instead upon a Mexican comparative con- 140</page><page sequence="29">ALLENDE &amp; VARO text. I do not mean to imply that Varo consciously re-oriented her artis- tic vision to conform to Mexican aesthetic styles and traditions: artistic inspiration does not operate so logically. Still, we discover forms and spirits akin to Varo's in the fragmented baroque surfaces of the retablos behind the altars of many Mexican colonial churches, with smooth estofado torsos of archetypal angels and saints emerging from vertical surfaces; or in the repeated natural and geometric mo- tifs carved or assembled on pre-Hispanic pyramids, from which also emerge smooth, rounded animal and human forms-the ceramic and stone figures that have lain buried behind their facades, to be resurrected by the archeologists of our century. Naturally, Varo knew this Mexican artistic and decorative tradition in its many forms, as well as de Chirico's paintings: it may even be an unconscious "sym- biosis" of de Chirico and Teotihuacin, so to speak, that contributes in some part to her brilliantly conceived spatial proportions, vol- umes, textures. But it is the Mexican part of this aesthetic mestizaje rather than the European that would have encouraged Varo's resis- tance to the process that Ortega y Gasset referred to as the dehu- manization of art. Varo's human subjects stand in stark contrast to the principal current of European (and U.S.) art after the thirties. Her Everywoman's evident subjectivity emphasizes Varo's distance from the technological formalism of which de Chirico's art is an ex- ample, from the large geometric and monochrome compositions and constructions and the minimalist and aleatory forms toward which artists in the Western industrialized countries have progres- sively moved during this century.'8 Both the themes and the composition of Varo's paintings seem to me to support Carpentier's conviction (strongly felt by the late thir- ties, first codified in 1948, and elaborated inter-artistically in his 1975 essay) that European Surrealism differed in spirit and practice from lo real maravilloso americano. In Latin America, Carpentier argues, the fantastic is not to be discovered by subverting or transcending reality with abstract forms and impossible images. Rather, the fantastic in- heres in the human realities of time and place, where improbable juxtapositions and marvelous mixtures exist by virtue of Latin America's history and geography and demography and politics, not by manifesto. This contradictory human reality-"la conciencia de ser otra cosa, de ser una cosa nueva," to repeat Carpentier's phrase- 18 Suzi Gablik charts this movement generally; Lucy Lippard charts it more specifi- cally. 141</page><page sequence="30">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE is the source of lo maravilloso in Varo's art, as it is in Isabel Allende's. It is their awareness of otherness, both cultural and cosmic, that causes their magical tables to jump and spin and conjure distant worlds. And it is their awareness of themselves as other, as creative females in patriarchal cultures, that keeps them in close contact with this world as well.19 University of Houston Works Cited Allende, Isabel.
