<plain_text><page sequence="1">JONATHAN CULLER Reading Lyric Several of de Man's late essays converge, in ways that have not been easy to understand, on the notion of the lyric. The difficulties are nicely exemplified in the essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, which declares of Baudelaire's "Correspondances" and "Obses- sion" that "the resulting couple or pair of texts indeed becomes a model for the uneasy combination of funereal monumentality with paranoid fear that char- acterizes the hermeneutics and the pedagogy of lyric poetry."' De Man con- cludes that we have no term to describe the sonnet "Correspondances." "All we know is that it is, emphatically, not a lyric. Yet it, and it alone, contains, implies, produces, generates, permits (or whatever aberrant verbal metaphor one wishes to choose) the entire possibility of the lyric" (261-62). What, then, is the lyric? To understand these late essays one must attempt to elucidate this notion of lyric or of what is involved, according to de Man, in reading something as a lyric, or in lyrical reading. "No lyric," he writes, "can be read lyrically, nor can the object of a lyrical reading be itself a lyric" (254). The place to start seems to me the continuity between de Man's claims here and a structuralist approach to genre-the best known is perhaps Todo- rov's work on the fantastic-which sees genres as sets of reading strategies or conventions for producing meaning. To treat a bit of journalistic prose as a lyric poem, for example, is to bring to bear on it a different set of expectations and strategies, including, most obviously, new assumptions about reference, but especially the assumption that something of significance is being said and a repertoire of ways to endow details with significance by establishing internal symbolic patterns and external tropological relations. One might also mention the assumption that interpretation should seek a level of abstraction at which unity can be achieved, and the convention that the text's typographic arrange- 1.

The current formulation of this view is that the lyric is a fictional imitation of personal utterance, so that to interpret a sequence as a lyric is a matter of working out who is speaking, in what situation, with what concerns, in what tone-aiming ultimately to articulate the full complexity of the speaker's attitudes, as revealed in the tones of the overheard utterance. To interpret a sequence as a lyric is to find ways of hearing in it a speaking voice, which is taken as a manifestation of consciousness.3 In the Anatomy of Criticism Northrop Frye defines the lyric as utterance overheard: "The lyric poet normally pretends to be talking to himself or to someone else: a spirit of nature, a Muse, a personal friend, a lover, a god, a personified abstraction, or a natural object.... The poet, so to speak, turns his back on his listeners."4 I have argued that apostrophe, the turning away from actual listeners to address absent or imagined interlocutors in the way Frye indicates, is the characteristic trope of lyric: apostrophe, with its "O"-O rose, thou art sick; 0 Wild West Wind; 0 chesnut tree-an 0, devoid of semantic reference, is the very figure of voice.5 Apostrophes are embarrassing, and crit- icism of the lyric has systematically avoided both the topic of apostrophe and actual apostrophes-translating apostrophes into description. One can argue that this embarrassement is linked to the obviousness that apostrophe is a figure, an empty 0, for which one can scarcely make cognitive or transcenden- tal claims of the sort that are routinely made for metaphor: it is embarrassing for the high callings of lyric to depend on, or even be linked closely with, this sort of figure. Critics have characteristically translated apostrophe into description ("O rose, thou art sick," is an intensified way of describing the rose as sick), but what the lyric or a lyrical reading (to use de Man's term) does is to translate description into 'apostrophe and anthropomorphism. In pairing "Correspon- dances" and "Obsession," de Man suggests that the mysterious declaratives of "Correspondances" give way to the specular totalization of "Obsession": "La nature est un temple" through which man passes, is transformed into: "Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cathedrales;" which sets speaker and natural object in an intersubjective relationship. In these late essays, de Man takes a considerable interest in apostrophe and some interest in other critics' inclination to avoid and ignore it. In "Hy- pogram and Inscription: Michael Riffaterre's Poetics of Reading" he sees as 2.

Riffaterre calls this address "personification" and dismisses it from his commentary by stressing the banality of describing the inanimate in animate terms. "Now it is certainly beyond question," de Man writes, with that assurance with which he generally states some proposition that might seem to need demonstration, "that the figure of address is recur- rent in lyric poetry, to the point of constituting the generic definition of, at the very least, the ode (which can, in its turn, be seen as paradigmatic for poetry in general). And that therefore it occurs, like all figures, in the guise of a clich6 or a convention is equally certain. None of this would allow one to discard or to ignore it as the main generative force that produces the poem in its entirety. "6 Hugo's "Ecrit sur la vitre d'une fenetre flamande," he notes, "is a decla- ration of love addressed to something or someone, staged as an address of one subject to another in a je-tu situation which can hardly be called descriptive." De Man also insists in these essays on a figure linked with apostrophe: pros- opopoeia, "the master trope of poetic discourse," the giving of face or voice to entities. The status of prosopopoeia and its relation to anthropomorphism is a crucial problem in de Man's conception of the lyric, and we shall return to it later. In the case of Hugo's poem, he continues, "The apostrophe, the address (0 vieux pays ... .) frames the description it makes possible. It is indeed a prosopopoeia, giving a face to two entities, "l'heure" and "l'esprit," which are most certainly deprived of any literal face. Yet by the end of the poem it is possible to identify without fail the je and the tu of line 1 [J'aime le carillon de tes cites antiques] as being mind and time. The figuration occurs by way of this address."7 The lyric characteristically depends on these figures of apos- trophe and prosopopoeia, which associate lyric with voice and, by presuming and foregrounding I-you relations, generate anthropomorphism, "a conceit by which human consciousness is projected or transferred into the natural world" (p. 89). "Anthropomorphism," de Man writes, involves not just a trope but an identification on the level of substance. It takes one entity for another and thus implies the constitution of specific en- tities prior to their confusion, the taking of something for something else that can then be assumed to be given. Anthropomorphism freezes the infinite chain of tropological transformations and propositions into one single asser- tion or essence. . . . [241] In reading "Obsession" as a translation of "Correspondances" into lyric intelligibility, de Man focuses on the apostrophes' I-you structure-the 6.

The surrealistic speech of live columns in "Correspondances" is naturalized in "Obsession" into the frightening but natural roar of the wind among the trees: Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cath6drales; Vous hurlez comme l'orgue; et dans nos coeurs maudits, Chambres d'6ternel deuil oii vibrent de vieux rales, R6pondent les 6chos de vos De profondis. "The final attribution of speech to the woods (vos De profondis) appears so natural," writes de Man, "that it takes an effort to notice that anthropomor- phism is involved" (256). While "Correspondances" asserts a series of equiv- alences without situating them in relation to a human subject, "Obsession" sets up a relation between inside and outside such that qualities, like echoes, can be passed back and forth, and poses the question of whether patterns are projected from outside to inside ("tes bonds et tes tumultes,/Mon esprit les retrouve en lui") or from inside to outside ("Mais les t6nebres sont elles- memes des toiles/Oui vivent, jaillissent de mon oeil pars milliers,/Des etres disparus aux regards familiers"). De Man notes that the relationship between "Correspondances" and "Obsession" can be historicized as Classical versus Romantic (terms, he writes, that are "rather crude metaphors for figural pat- terns rather than historical events or acts") [254]. He sums up as follows: What we call the lyric, the instance of represented voice, conveniently spells out the rhetorical and thematic characteristics that make it the paradigm of a complementary relationship between grammar, trope, and theme. The set of characteristics includes the various structures and moments we encountered along the way [in the interpretation of "Obsession"]: specular symmetry along an axis of assertion and negation (to which correspond the generic mir- ror images of the ode, as celebration, and the elegy, as mourning), the gram- matical transformation of the declarative into the vocative modes of ques- tion, exclamation, address, hypothesis, etc., the tropological transformation of analogy into apostrophe, or the equivalent, more general transforma- tion ... of trope into anthropomorphism. The lyric is not a genre, but one name among several to designate the defensive motion of understanding, the possibility of a future hermeneutics. From this point of view, there is no sig- nificant difference between one generic term and another: all have the same apparently intentional and temporal function. [261] This last sentence is mysterious: why "apparently intentional"? The sug- gestion is that all genres are ways of convincing ourselves not only that lan- guage is meaningful, that it will give rise to an intuition or understanding, but that this is an understanding of the world. The lyric seems to consist of</page><page sequence="5">102 Yale French Studies patterns of anthropomorphism and naturalization that guarantee the intel- ligibility of tropes. "Figural gestures-metaphor, apostrophe, prosopopoeia- are stabilized into a presentation of the naturalness of the human."8 De Man goes on to observe that "Generic terms such as 'lyric' (or its various sub- species, 'ode,' 'idyll,' or 'elegy') as well as pseudo-historical period terms such as 'romanticism' or 'classicism' are always terms of resistance and nostalgia, at the furthest remove from the materiality of actual history" (262). One problem that arises is this: we can understand perfectly well the notion of generic categories as modes of understanding and naturalization. Someone taking this view can argue that no text really "is" a lyric but that, as de Man puts it, these are merely nostalgic categories for classifying and mas- tering texts. Genres are ethical and aesthetic defenses against language. But at certain moments de Man apparently wants there to be lyrics, wants to call "Obsession" a lyric. "No lyric," he writes, "can be read lyrically, nor can the object of a lyrical reading be itself a lyric" (254). This puzzling statement at the very least assumes that there are such things as lyrics. "Correspon- dances" is not a lyric, for it is the object of that lyrical reading called "Obses- sion" (and the other translations into lyric intelligibility that make up the tradition of interpretation of this much read poem). "Obsession," a lyric, can- not be read lyrically: it cannot be translated into lyric intelligibility, both because it does not need or provoke a defensive reading-motion (it is already itself such a translation) and perhaps also because a true "reading," in an- other sense de Man often gives the word, would be a deconstruction or an identification of tropes-a prosaic reading rather than a lyricizing account of man and nature.9 The play of both "lyric" and "reading" here can be seen as instances of the "persistent dismantling or inversion of each formulation or concept" that William Ray has recently described as a source of the power of de Man's writing.'0 Terms or categories to which one gives weight prove to have been used elsewhere with a contrary valorization or in a quite different sense which nevertheless seems systematic rather than accidental. One might say that apodictic statements which prove not precisely compatible take the place, in de Man's writings, of Derrida's neologisms, his nonconcepts, and his typographical structures or devices. De Man's play consists of the slippage of terms in weighty assertions that resist reconciliation. 8. Cynthia Chase, Decomposing Figures: Rhetorical Readings in the Romantic Tradition (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986), chapter 4. 9. In "Hypogram and Inscription" de Man makes glancing reference to "Correspondances" in terms which he would later call a lyrical reading but which he here identifies as pertaining "to the canonical 'idee recue' of the poem, not to the poem read" (35 n, my italics). A discussion of the term reading would not only have to explicate this sense of reading (what de Man and a few others do) and its quite different sense in lyrical reading, but also to decide what to call what critics have generally done to lyrics such as "Obsession" when they interpret them (since "no lyric can be read lyrically"). 10.

On the one hand, "prosopopoeia as positing voice or face by means of language" (81) seems the basis of anthropomorphism, and is given generic associations: "prosopopoeia, the master trope of poetic discourse." "Pros- opopoeia is the trope of autobiography, by which one's name ... is made as intelligible and memorable as a face" (76). Yet in "Wordsworth and the Vic- torians" de Man can be interpreted as distinguishing prosopopoeia from an- thropomorphism: emphasizing that the former is "an active verbal deed, a claim . . . not given in the nature of things" while the latter, as he says in "Anthropomorphism and Trope," is "an identification on the level of sub- stance, the taking of something for something else that can then be assumed to be given" (241). Rather than being a defining constituent of lyric or lyrics, then, prosopopoeia gets associated with an originary catachresis or the point at which what de Man calls in "Shelley Disfigured" "the senseless power of positional language" (117) posits trope-an impossible but necessary mo- ment. Prosopopoeia would then be precisely what gets lyrically misread in a lyrical reading or a lyric." One further statement in "Anthropomorphism and Trope" suggests a line to be pursued in asking what a lyric is. De Man writes, "The lyric de- pends entirely for its existence on the denial of phenomenality as the surest means to recover what it denies" (259). He is discussing the fact that the sensory richness of "Correspondances" is replaced in "Obsession" by an ab- sence of sensory representation- "je cherche le vide, le noir, et le nu," for example, or simply "les tenebres," pure darkness-but that at this very mo- ment the poem reasserts the possibility, even ineluctability of representation: Mais les t6nebres sont elles memes des toiles Oui vivent, jaillissant de mon oeil par milliers, Des etres disparus aux regards familiers. The suggestion that "the lyric depends entirely for its existence on the denial of phenomenality as the surest means to recover what it denies" is connected with the claim at the beginning of "Lyrical Voice in Contemporary Theory" that "The principle of intelligibility, in lyric poetry, depends on the phe- nomenalization of the poetic voice."112 De Man goes on to argue that 11.

Jauss, Toward an Aesthetic of Reception (Minneapolis: U. of Minnesota Press, 1982).</page><page sequence="7">104 Yale French Studies Riffaterre and Hans Robert Jauss, in different ways, repress figural and literal aspects of the signifier in order to make poetic voice "coincide with the phe- nomenality of its own discourse." The phenomenalization or actualization of voice can be shown to be challenged, however, both in the practice of their reading and in the theory that sustains it. "The consequences for a theory of the lyric," de Man writes, "and, more generally, for the relationship between genre and figure are far-reaching but too complex for summary exposition." Exposition is left to others, while he offers exemplification in two readings "in which the phenomenality of the form is critically examined in terms of figural substitutions or material inscriptions." Phenomenality is the key term here. To gloss it one might say that the idea of perception presumes a phenomenal world-phenomena that are given to perception (as opposed to an imposition or positing of forms). De Man argues, by way of readings of Hegel, Hugo, and others, that phenomenality is the product of figuration; he argues for what he calls in The Rhetoric of Ro- manticism "the dependence of any perception ... on the totalizing power of language" (91). (To take this line is to emphasize language as act over lan- guage as representation.) However, the notion of the phenomenality of language-that there is given to perception a body of sensible signifiers which stand in a representa- tional relation to conceptual signifieds that are given to the understanding- is crucial to the notion of reliable cognition. And one function of the aesthet- ic and of texts placed in the category of the aesthetic has been to link the sensuous and the conceptual in a phenomenal relation modeled on the appar- ent phenomenality of language and its signifying process. Of Hugo's "Ecrit sur la vitre d'une fenetre flamande" de Man writes, "the phenomenal and sensory properties of the signifier [here the "carillon"] have to serve as guar- antors for the certain existence of the signified and, ultimately, of the refer- ent," time.13 Cynthia Chase explains: "the process of signification, which has a material element, is made to serve as an example and a guarantee of the phenomenality of experience. But this belies the arbitrary nature of the link between signifier and signified, the sign's independence of sensory determin- ations; the materiality rather than the phenomenality of the sign. In fact, the process of signification can exemplify phenomenal experience only by means of a figuration."''4 De Man's most accessible explanation of the supposed phenomenality of language comes in the argument that Saussure's work on anagrams, which reveals potentially endless patterns that might or might not signify, shows that to perceive the signifier at all is to confer on some patterns but not others the status of meaningful articulations. The impossibility of determining 13. "Hypogram and Inscription," 33. 14. Chase, Decomposing Figures, chap. 4.</page><page sequence="8">JONATHAN CULLER 105 whether such patterns signify or not, are encoded or not, amounts to "the undoing of the phenomenality of language"-that is, the undoing of the as- sumption that linguistic structures are given as perceivable and intelligible. He writes, "We would then have witnessed, in effect, the undoing of the phenomenality of language, which always entails (since the phenomenal and noumenal are binary poles within the same system) the undoing of cognition and its replacement by the uncontrollable power of the letter as inscription."'5 Anagrams, a random occurrence of syllables read or misread as a key word, provide a model of language that is germane to the question of the lyric. What de Man calls the materiality of language (or of "actual history" in a passage cited earlier) is, as Chase put its, "what is prior to the figuration that give the text its phenomenal status," but which, as de Man insists, "cannot be isolated 'as such,' as a 'moment,' as an origin."'16 However, a pairing, such as "Correspondances" and "Obsession," which lets one think about figural transformations and anthropomorphisms enables one to treat certain difficul- ties, unintelligibilities, as what has been transformed. But this sort of pairing poses a problem-a problem about reading lyrics. De Man's account of the lyric and lyrical reading makes "Obsession" a lyric and a lyrical reading of "Correspondances"-a translation into intelligibility, anthropomorphism, phenomenality. But that tempts one to say, reciprocally, that "Correspondances" demystifies "Obsession." De Man's analysis of the pair suggests that in reading lyrics we should seek out the infratext that ex- poses the lyrical translations accomplished by lyrics, but he emphatically denies that "Correspondances" can be taken as a reading of "Obsession." "No symmetrical reversal of this lyrical reading-motion is conceivable" (261). Of course, reversal is not just conceivable but seductive, if not irresist- ible. Readers of "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" will be led to seek, for every lyric, a nonlyrical infratext-whether another text or a recon- struction-that demysties it, exposes it as anthropomorphism. De Man's es- say itself functions in precisely the way he denies is conceivable; by arguing that "Correspondances" is not a lyric but contains and implies all the pos- sibilities of lyric, he makes it in effect, if not in principle, a reading of lyric: an exposition of its constitutive conditions. Why does de Man emphatically deny this course, this possibility? In part to expose it as a recuperative strategy of understanding. To take the unin- telligibility of "Correspondances" as demystification would be precisely to recuperate it: to make it no longer a materiality on which meaning is im- posed by lyrical translation but a further instance of meaningfulness.

Chase, op. cit.</page><page sequence="9">106 Yale French Studies ing ourselves against this course, however, will not forestall it, and we seem to be left in a situation where de Man's writings will lead us to read lyrics in precisely the way he tells us not to. However, uncomfortable or inappropriate this condition, it seems a gen- eral consequence of de Man's work. For example, though his writings focus on what resists or disrupts the hermeneutic process and repeatedly oppose an understanding which overcomes textual difficulties so as to hear in the text what it is thought to say, this is the only way to understand or interpret de Man. One can only make sense of his writings if one already has a sense of what they must be saying and can allow for the slippage of concepts, working to get over or around the puzzling valuations, the startling assertions, the apparently incompatible claims. To learn from his writings, one must read him in precisely the ways he warns us against, and the same may well prove true for reading lyrics. If we try to avoid performing lyrical readings on lyri- cs-and he tells us lyrics cannot be read lyrically-we will seek or recon- struct demystificatory infratexts, reversing the lyrical reading-motion in a way he says is inconceivable.
