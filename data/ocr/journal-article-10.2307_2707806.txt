<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIR THOMAS BROWNE AND THE METAPHOR OF THE CIRCLE 1 BY FRANK LIVINGSTONE HUNTLEY Thus is Man that great and true Amphibium, whose nature is disposed to live, not onely like other creatures in divers elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.2 If Milton justified the ways of God to man, Browne, a humbler Christian, sought only to justify the ways of man to God. He appeals to many readers today largely because of his ability, in language that startles while it informs, to reconcile science and religion. On the relationship of these two worlds in his thinking, one view, represented by Basil Willey, extends to Browne that "unified sensi- bility " which Eliot found in the metaphysical poets: It meant the capacity [Willey writes] to live in divided and distinguished worlds, and to pass freely to and fro between one and another, to be capable of many and varied responses to experience, instead of being confined to a few stereotyped ones .... [The worlds of the mind] were divided and dis- tinguished, perhaps, but not, as later, by such high barriers that a man was shut up for life in one or another of them .... The point about these differ- ent worlds was not that they were divided, but that they were simultane- ously available .... Something of the peculiar quality of the "meta- physical " mind is due to this fact of its not being finally committed to any one world. Instead, it could hold them all in a loose synthesis together, yielding itself, as only a mind in free poise can, to the passion of detecting analogies and correspondences between them.3 But D. K. Ziegler holds that Sir Thomas divorced reason and faith through his use of rational faculties in the one world and a rhetorical display of metaphor and paradox in the other. Ziegler accuses Browne of merely playing with religion: The result is that the analogical and anthropomorphic thinking which he rejects as a scientist delights him as the religious man. As a scientist he tries to clarify and enlarge the field of knowledge, as a religious man he says " I love to lose myself in a mystery." 4 1 This paper grows out of an earlier one, "Sir Thomas Browne, M.D., William Harvey, and the Metaphor of the Circle," Bull. of the History of Medicine [Johns Hopkins], XXV (1951), 236-247. That paper dealt with the interrelations of two sciences, astronomy and anatomy; this, with the interrelations of Browne's science and his religion. 2 Religio Medici, Part I, sec. xxxiv.

HUNTLEY It would be useless to attempt to prove that Browne failed to dis- tinguish between science and religion. Though for many in the Middle Ages Aristotle's first cause and the Christian's God were metaphysi- cally identified, still from the thirteenth century distinctions between the two worlds had been maintained. To separate yet join, at once, science and religion, the Middle Ages made theology queen of the sciences, differing not in kind but degree. Even with the limited ad- vance of empirical science up to Browne's time this method was ques- tioned; yet Browne does not deviate from the hierarchy. He places divinity above philosophy as a higher or ultimate truth. But they are not held together (as Willey suggests) in a " loose synthesis." In the Platonic rather than Aristotelian mode, the dichotomous terms, divinity and philosophy, together form a whole. And they can form a whole only as Browne can make vital connections between them which lift him, as it were, from the visible to the invisible world. More the poet than the philosopher, and more the devotional writer than the theologian, Browne puts his metaphors to work not only to express the reality but also the immediately apprehended attributes of that reality. Metaphors mark the necessary " correspondencies." Hence, the problem of his dependence upon the circle metaphor in Religio Medici is a double one: of epistemology-how does one know God? and of language--how does a poetic scientist like Browne talk about this kind of knowledge? Browne combines the use of the circle by the poet and its use by the scientist.8 And it is this that justifies a separate treatment of the circle-metaphor in his work.6 At a time when Baconian science was making the two worlds of reality more disparate, Browne actually resolved the question of how man can be a part of both. In returning to Willey's basic position that Browne emphasizes not the two worlds but man as the true am- phibium between them, this paper attempts to go beyond Willey in demonstrating the connections through an examination of the circle- concept in Browne's scientific and religious reasoning. The circle is an essential of the very style which so largely has preserved the Religio Medici to our day: "There is a nearer way to Heaven," Browne wrote, "than Homer's chain; an easie Logic may conjoin Heaven and Earth in one Argument, and with less than a Sorites resolve all things unto God" (RM, I, xviii). Here, "easie" means, not "lazy," but "immediately apprehensible." Since in his own process of thinking and feeling Browne rises from 5 Cf. William P. Dunn, Sir Thomas Browne: A Study in Religious Philosophy (Minneapolis, 1950), ch. ii, " Faith and Reason." 6 Marjorie Nicolson, The Break- ing of the Circle (Evanston, Ill., 1950), has shown that Browne is relatively a new- comer to an old tradition. I am indebted to Miss Nicolson for far more than even this book. Also, Egon S.

Browne's philosophy fed his faith. The two sciences he had loved most up to the writing of Religio were astronomy and anatomy: one studied avocationally, the other professionally. Copernicus and Harvey7 be- came emblems, so to speak, of the science of the universe and of the science of the body of man. Both dealt in circles. And a metaphor connected them-the Hermetical conceit of the zodiacal physiology. In his amateur study of astronomy Browne continually used the image of the circle-in the ordering of the stars, in time, and in the mechanical contrivances for measuring time. He was at home in this larger world: " I know the names," he wrote, " and somewhat more, of all the constellations in my Horizon " (RM, II, vii). As late as 1680 his son Edward's description of a comet reminded him of the " very long tayle " of one that he had observed as a thirteen-year-old boy.8 Since then, he had read the comments on it of observers from the Royal Society. By its parallax, Sir Thomas tells his son, astrono- mers . . . find out the comets distance from the earth, and in that of 1618 they found it to bee as farre above the moone as the moone is above the earth .... " 9 He firmly believed that God, as Wisdom and Eternity (RM, I, x), had set this great wheel of heavenly bodies around us, and that only within it we creatures of time move and have our being. Half be- lieving in astrology, he corresponded with Dr. William Lilly, whose Christian Astrology (1647) he had read,10 and he was a friend of Dr. Arthur Dee, the son of Queen Elizabeth's famous astrologer. To tell us he is not yet thirty, Browne writes that he has not yet seen " one revolution of Saturn" (RM, I, xli). It has become almost trite to mention his dying on his own birthday, after he had written: ... in Persons who out-live many Years, and when there are no less than three hundred sixty-five days to determine their Lives in every Year,-that the first day should make the last, that the Tail of the Snake should return into its Mouth precisely at that time, and they should wind up upon the day of their Nativity, is indeed a remarkable Coincidence, which tho Astrology hath taken witty pains to salve, yet hath it been very wary in making Pre- dictions of it.11 He fulfilled his own circle. 7 Not an arbitrary linking of two great names in science.

HUNTLEY The more the new astronomy depended upon advances in mathe- matics, the more circles there were to remind Browne of his metaphor. Once, mathematics had been a straight line, but with trigonometry and the calculus it moved in circles. William Oughtred at Oxford applied logarithms to concentric circles as early as 1627 and became one of the inventors of the slide rule. His device was an eighteen- inch circle with a smaller disk that revolved within it-an exact me- chanical depiction of the Ptolemaic and Copernican epicycle. Pascal became famed for his mathematical solution of the figure described by the head of a nail driven in the spoke, well within the circumfer- ence, of a moving wagon wheel. Delamain's Grammalogia or Mathe- matical Ring (1630) extended Oughtred's circular concepts. And Oughtred's pupil, William Foster, dedicated The Circles of Proportion and the Horizontal Instrument (1632) to Sir Kenelm Digby.l2 Through a reading of John Dee's introduction to the first transla- tion into English of Euclid's Elements (1570), Browne might have learned that ". . of all sciences, next to Theologie, [mathematics] is most divine, most pure, most ample and generall, most profounde, most subtile, most commodious and most necessary." 13 For Dee, Elizabeth's alchemical astrologer, calls often upon "Divine Plato," particularly the Plato of the Timaeus. How fascinating for Browne were wheels as they connect with the sun's time! Under the " Doc- trine of circular motions" in Vulgar Errors he quotes this passage from Dr. Dee's introduction to Euclid: By Wheels strange works and incredible are done: A wondrous example was seen in my time in a certain Instrument . . . therein was one Wheel that moved at such a rate, that in seven thousand years only his own period should be finished; a thing almost incredible, but how far I keep within my bounds, many men yet alive can tell.14 Such mechanical devices, "composed by Trochilick or the artifice of wheels," 15 as chronometers and planetaria merely imitate on a small scale the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. To the seventeenth- century user of the circle-emblem, they furnished at once a precision and a wonder lacking in the later Christian apologists' refuge in a stock metaphor of the intricate watch.16 The heavens declared the glory of God to Browne through circles. 12 Except for the allusion to Pascal, these facts are to be found in R.

What of the circle in a science even closer to the doctor, anatomy? The answer is better postponed temporarily for the figure of the circle in the macrocosm and microcosm, which for ages had connected man to the universe outside him. Browne got this circular figure not from empirical science but from a wide acquaintance with Plato, Plotinus, Galen, the Hermetic and Orphic writings, the Cabbala, and Para- celsus. The microcosm made connections for him between these two favorite sciences of his. What is more, its essential metaphor start- lingly described what he knew to be true: man is related by nature to God. So ancient and universal is the conceit that it would be impossible to trace Browne's sources for it.17 But one source well known to all medical students of the seventeenth century, including Harvey, was Galen. Browne wrote that there is " as much Divinity in Galen his book De Usu Partium, as in Suarez Metaphysicks " (RM, I, xiv). Of all Galen's writings the most popular among Christian teleologists was the famous hymn, chapter 10 in Book III of De Usu Partium. In this hymn Galen praises the " Creator's " wisdom in the smallest animal as well as in the universe: ". . the ancients who were familiar with na- ture held that the animal itself was, so to speak, a little universe." 18 According to Dr. Charles Singer, the historian of medicine, The work of Copernicus removed the earth from the center of the universe: that of Vesalius revealed the real structure of man's body. Between the two they destroyed forever the favourite medieval theory of Macrocosm and Microcosm.l9 In the mind of Browne, however, which was stocked with astronomy and trained in the medical tradition of Vesalius at Padua, the poetic and religious values of the macro- and microcosm were far from destroyed. For in the metaphor God is the large circle about us, and man is 17Two valuable treatises on the macrocosm-microcosm theory are George P. Conger, Theories of Macrocosms and Microcosms in the History of Philosophy (New York, 1922), a historical survey; and Rudolf Allers' systematic analysis in " Micro- cosmus: from Anaximandros to Paracelsus," in Traditio, II (1944), 319-407. 18 Tr. by Arthur J.

HUNTLEY the smaller circle within and related to that larger movement by natu- ral law. Man carries within him the illimitable spaces of the Universe, and hence is not a forgotten speck unfixed in the void: " There is no man alone, .because every man is a Microcosm and carries the whole World about him " (RM, II, x). The smallest circle then becomes the womb of our mother-" That other World, the truest Microcosm" (RM, I, xxxix). From this relationship Browne can proceed to a mathematical proportion: God is to the universe, as the universe is to man, as the womb is to the foetus-expressed by images of circles within circles. The twin sciences of astronomy and anatomy meet in the theory of the microcosm, a meeting symbolized by the melothesia 20 or zodiacal man, which protectively assigns the parts of man's anatomy to the various mansions of the sky. When Browne is less tropical and more scientific, as in Vulgar Errors, he notes dispassionately that the the- ory that man is magnetic would ".. . advance the Microcosmical con- ceit, and commend the Geography of Paracelsus, who according to the Cardinal points of the World, divideth the body of man. .. ."21 Bombastus Paracelsus and Fludd the Rosicrucian imagined and set forth the relationship between man and his universe in drawings and descriptions of the little circle moving in harmony with the larger circle around him. Fludd's great Medicina Catholica (1619-1631) is full of such pictures, usually with the organs of the left side of the man's body oriented toward the north.22 But Padua, intellectual host to the great circles of Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo, nourished Vesalius, Fabricius, and William Har- vey.23 Padua taught anatomy also to the young Thomas Browne. Browne's formal education was one of the best Europe could afford: Winchester, Oxford, Montpellier, Padua, and Leyden. Though Browne does not mention Harvey in the Religio Medici, it is incon- ceivable that his type of mind, in view of his interest in astronomy and the Hermetic conceit, could have rejected the theory of circularity. In these very terms Harvey dedicated his great discovery to Charles I: " Serenissime Rex, cor animalium fundamentum est vitae ": 20 The term is etymologically related to the concept of the music (melos, melody) of the spheres. The graphic tradition of the melothesia is beautifully explained in Charles Singer, " The Scientific Views and Visions of Saint Hildegard," Stud. Hist. and Method of Science, I (1917). 2i Bk.

The heart of animals is the basis of their life, the princi- ple of the whole, the Sun of their Microcosm, that upon which all movement depends, from which all strength proceeds.24 And the first actual hint of the circulation theory comes in that modest sentence in Chapter VIII: " Coepi egomet mecum cogitare, an motionem quondam quasi in circulo haberet." Once he has done this, he is off on the imaginative plane of comparison: "The heart, consequently, is the beginning of life: the Sun of the Microcosm, even as the Sun in his turn might well be designated the heart of the World. .. ." 25 As most people know, the rest of Harvey's thesis is quantitatively argued, but few recall this Copernican metaphor in physiology, or remember how the concept of the micro- within the macrocosm struck the seventeenth-century minds to whom Harvey entrusted his great argument. The circle was emphasized by Dr. Alexander Ross in his early animadversions on Religio Medici entitled Medicus Medicatus (1645). Quoting from the Religio the phrase " that streight and reg- ular line, that settled and constant course the Wisdom of God " (RM, I, xvi), Ross overlooks Browne's context and full intention26 and asks: And why is Nature rather a straight, then a circular line? We see the world is round, the motions of the heavens and starres are circular, the generation and corruption of sublunary bodies is also circular; the corruption of one being still the generation of another; snow begets water, and water begets snow; the rivers returne to the sea, from whence they flow .... And what say you to the circulation of the bloud in our bodies? 27 By means of the metaphor of the circle, Alexander Ross, the least metaphysical of physicians, in 1645 joined the movement of the hea- vens, the motion of time, globular geography, and the circulating blood stream of the body of man. It was a commonplace in the seventeenth century. Baldwin Hamey, for example, concluded a brief life of Harvey with this epigram: That according to the opinion of Copernicus as to the motion of the earth and of Harvey as to the movement of the blood we are here- 24 Though Michigan has a 1628 edition of De Motu Cordis, I have consulted the tercentenary reproduction of 1928 and the translation made for G.

Sang.; which discovery I prefer to that of Columbus " 29-obviously contrasts the small circle of blood to the " great circle " voyage of 1492.30 As Browne's major interest in comparative anatomy increased, that " more absolute piece of optics," 31 the microscope, came into use and helped to fix in his mind the wonder of God's creation in its small as well as large dimensions. On the use of the microscope, Browne's young friend and protege Dr. Henry Power of Halifax became the first man in England to publish a book.32 The work owed its inception, philosophy, and some of its style to Dr. Thomas Browne of Norwich.33 In a peroration to the Fellows of Gresham College, Dr. Power declares that a scientist before the invention of the microscope as an aid to the study of anatomy ... understood no more of Nature than a rude Countrey-fellow does of the Internal Fabrick of a Watch, that onely sees the Index and Horary Circle, and perchance hears the, Clock and Alarum strike in it: But he that will give a satisfactory Account of these Phaenomena, must be an Artificer indeed, and one well skill'd in the Wheel-work and Internal Contrivance of such Anatomical Engines.34 In this swift review of the figure that persistently came to Thomas Browne, M.D., from a study of astronomy and anatomy, we have passed from the larger circles of the sun's time to the smaller circles 28 Quoted by Dr. Norman Moore, The History of the Study of Medicine in the British Isles (Oxford, 1908), 2-3. 29 Letters (ed. Keynes, VI, 277). The date 1646 comes from Power's answer to the letter. It is interesting that Browne anticipated by three years the title of Harvey's book, which beginning in 1649 added " De Circulatione Sanguinis" to the "De Motu Cordis." Cf. Keynes, Bibliography of Harvey (1928), No. 8. 30 The metaphorical process of thought seems to have led Fludd the Rosicrucian to accept Harvey's thesis while many a more rationalistic mind was repudiating it.

Also, between these two sciences lay ready for his connecting type of mind that richly suggestive Hermetic conceit of the macrocosm and microcosm. His entire "philosophy " is instinct with neo-Platonism, which by its mathematical character opposed the Aristotelian philosophy. It is now time to return to the Religio Medici to understand, finally, how the actual figures of the circles in " philosophy " became for him the most appropriate way of talking about the abstractions of his religious faith. The core of religion is man's relationship to God. In the Religio Medici Browne the devout doctor explains for the ordinary reader what his ideas on this problem are. He can see the truth of what he thinks and can make us see it with him better by concretizing that truth through the use of the metaphor of the circle within the circle. Professor Douglas Bush has rightly said that Browne's favorite image is the circle.35 For the Religio Medici is not a formal treatise on the- ology but a confessio. At the end of his " To the Reader " Browne wrote: There are many things delivered Rhetorically, many expressions therein merely Tropical, and as they best illustrate my intention; and therefore also there are many things to be taken in a soft flexible sense, and not to be called unto the rigid test of Reason. Nor is this bold scepticism in so fideistic a work merely the bedside lucubrations of a stylist whose chief delight to read is his invitation to wander. The unity of the book is more metaphorical than logical. The whole exposition of his faith moves in a great wheel from God to man, and from man's creation, in the wheel of time, to his death and resurrection. More specifically, Browne enlisted the metaphor of the circle to express those truths of religion which relate to God, to the church, and to himself as he, the homunculus, is marvelously inte- grated with God and His visible communion. What is God? Browne asserts that "beyond all the Metaphysical definitions of Divines" he likes best that allegorical description " of Hermes Trismegistus-God is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.36 The concept of God so defies human reason that only an imaginative adumbration can at once be exact and enforce our humility. To Browne this metaphor is no hy- perbole since words cannot exceed where they cannot express enough. Hence this metaphor for him more completely and more directly de- fines the reality, God, than do such terms as " first cause," "omneity," or " entelechy." 35 English Literature in the Earlier Seventeenth Century (Oxford, 1945), 332. 36 RM, I, x, and Christian Morals, III, ii (Keynes, I, 14 and 134).

HUNTLEY Where he got the apparently Plotinian " description" we do not know, but it is probable that he heard it first from his Pembroke tu- tor, Dr. Thomas Lushington, a liberal theologian steeped in the Chris- tian neo-Platonism of Proclus-that ancient who raised Euclid to divinity. Though the origins of the definition are unknown, it ap- pears to have been set down first and ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus in the pseudo-Hermetic Liber XXIV Philosophorum of the twelfth century. There it is the second of the twenty-four definitions of God: II. Deus est sphaera infinita, cuius centrum est ubique, circumferentia nusquam. Haec definitio data est per modum imaginandi ut centrum ipsam primam causam in vita sua. Terminus quidem suae extensionis est supra, ubi et extra terminans. Propter hoc ubique est centrum eius, nullam habens dimensionem. Anima enim, cum quaerit circumferentiam sphaeritatis, ele- vata in infinitum dicet, quia quicquid est sine dimensione, sicut creans fuit, et sine initio est. Et sic eius terminus nusquam. Sic patet propositum.87 In the thirteenth century this "definition" was quoted by St. Thomas, Bonaventura, Bartolomaeus Anglicus, Master Eckart, and many others.38 Nicholas of Cusa gave it prominence in the second book of De Docta Ignorantia (1462),39 whose scepticism, paradoxical emphasis on wisdom through ignorance, and neo-Platonic exaltation of mathematics inspired Copernicus and Giordano Bruno. Between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries men had perceived in the " soft flexible sense " of this definition God's containment of the Many and the One, the Visible and the Invisible. From God as a circle whose center is everywhere and whose cir- cumference is nowhere, Browne extends the metaphor to the concept of eternity, of time, and the familiar cyclical view of history. His astron- omy had taught him that time is circular since it is the nature of the sun to make a revolution every day (RM, I, xv); hence, ". .. the lives, not only of men, but of Commonwealths, and the whole world, run not upon an Helix that still enlargeth, but on a Circle .. ."

God is not subject to the circle but moves it, for all his- tory begins and ends with Him. Fundamental to the neo-Platonic tradition, as it was also to Aristotelian scholasticism and the Tao, was the cycle of birth and death; and it is no accident that in his medical studies this pious doctor thought most steadily on those ever-circling opposites-generation and corruption.40 " To difference my self nearer, and draw into a lesser circle " (RM, I, v), Browne describes his faith in God as a humble one that follows " the great wheel of the Church, by which I move not reserving any proper Poles or motion from the Epicycle of my own brain " (RM, I, vi). He loved the Anglican Communion.41 Not to mesh one's own life in that greater wheel, and that wheel in the wheel of God,42 is to lose its even motion for the chaotic jerkiness of one's private judg- ment. Heretics and atheists are ". . . unstable Judgments that can- not consist in the narrow point and centre of Virtue without a reel or stagger to the Circumference " (RM, I, iii). In the first paragraph of his Vulgar Errors he warns us: And therefore in this Encyclopaedia and round of Knowledge, like the great and exemplary Wheels of Heaven, we must observe two Circles: that while we are daily carried about, and whirled by the swing and rapt of the one, we may maintain a natural and proper course, in the slow and sober wheel of the other.43 This epicycle figure of speech exactly expresses Browne's idea on the relationship between individual liberty and universal law, between man and God. Finally, Browne is himself a circle inside these larger circles: " In mine own reason, and within my self, I can command that which I cannot intreat without my self, and within the circle of another" (RM, II, iv). As he is a mind he partakes of God: " That mass of Flesh that circumscribes me, limits not my mind. ... I take my circle to be above three hundred and sixty . . ." (RM, II, xi). Wher- ever God manifests Himself, ". .. there is Heaven, though within the circle of this sensible world." 44 We have already seen how the small- est circle is the womb, that truest microcosm, and how Harvey dis- covered a circle inside that. Proceeding now from the smallest to the 40 Cf. on death the Urn Burial, ch.

Ezekiel, I: 15-16: " Now as I beheld the living creatures ... their appear- ance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel." 43 Ed. Keynes, II, 3. 44 RM, I, xlix.

HUNTLEY largest, we pass from the world of the womb, through this globe of geography, at last into the timeless spirit of God-through three stages of epistemology: sense, philosophy, and divinity.45 These respective circles can be limitations, or as Browne calls them "circumscrip- tions."46 Sense limits reason, and reason limits faith. We are still free as children of God to refine our sense by means of our reason and pursue our philosophy to an 0 altitudo. Near the end of a life of such thinking Browne wrote: " Calculate thy self within, seek not thy self in the Moon, but in thine own Orb or Microcosmical Circumference. Let celestial aspects admonish and advertize, not conclude and determine thy ways." 47 The truth of re- ligion here is that God operates the universe; man is a small part in- side that universe; but God does not dictate our movements, He only sets a pattern of regularity which we can follow if we are wise. The perception of such a truth through metaphor had been one of the signs of maturity of mind when Browne was barely thirty years old, for in the Religio Medici he had long before written: ". .. to call ourselves a Microcosm, or little World, I thought it only a pleasant trope of Rhetorick, till my neer judgement and second thoughts told me there was a real truth therein " (RM, I, xxxiv). The circular figures of the new and old " philosophy " had richly furnished his faith. Thus the quotation from Ziegler is more than a point of depar- ture. His argument that Browne divorced reason and faith by using rational criteria in the one and mere metaphors in the other loses much of its impressiveness when we examine the seventeenth-century scientific and religious milieu, Browne's own intellectual temper, and his style not as ornament but as a means to the end of exact expres- sion. For one thing, as anyone believes who has had some experience in intuitive religious insight (for example, through the practice of Zen), other methods exist besides the purely rational one of arriving at religious truth. As ritual is to worship, so metaphor and paradox are to devotional theology. Finally, to connect two kinds of truth, religious and scientific, analogy is a legitimate instrument. When the two kinds of truth are a " lower " and a " higher," by means of meta- phor Browne projects himself from one into the other. By making these epistemic relations between science and religion, appropriate to a book entitled Religio Medici, Browne demonstrates that man is the true amphibium between these two distinguished and often divided worlds: " We are onely that amphibious piece between a corporal and spiritual Essence, that middle form that links those two together, and makes good the Method of God and Nature ..."
