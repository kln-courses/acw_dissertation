<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Classical Review NOVEMBER 1909 ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS THE CONNECTION OF THE /EGEAN CULTURE WITH SERVIA. IN the current volume of the Annual of the British School at Athens 1 Dr. Vassits restates his views on the relationship of Servia to the AEgean in prehistoric times, and in doing so deals with several suggestions which we put forward in this Review last December. He gives an excellent summary of his important finds, and as the result of much careful observation, is now enabled to put forward a scheme for arranging the early Servian antiquities in chronological order. This we have no intention of criticising, nor do we dispute any of the archaeological facts that he has discovered, for we only wish to discuss briefly in this paper some of the comparisons he makes between the Servian finds and those from Thessaly and Crete. Most of the Servian finds he assigns to an age of metal, and apparently means by a ' Bronze Age'an age in which bronze was known, but not necessarily used for cutting instruments, the more usual meaning. So for convenience we will here adopt his use of the term. In the first place, it will be well to clear up a slight misunderstanding; 2 we have never called the Klicevac statuette neolithic, nor classed it with earlier figurines; we have only pointed out how it differs from the Thessalian, Trojan, and Mycenean figurines. Dr. Vassits concludes that the prehistoric settlements of Servia were formed under the 'continuous influence of a south-eastern civilisation,' by which is apparently meant the prehistoric civilisation of the AEgean.8 Throughout the arguments used to support this contention one feature is very notice- able-evidence is gathered indiscriminately from Troy, Thessaly, and the /Egean proper. These three regions, though all to the south- east of Servia geographically, are archaeo- logically distinct from one another. It is, indeed, very doubtful if Troy can be called A.gean in the true sense at all. Pro- fessor Doerpfeld has said,4 'After all the correspondences, the civilisation that con- fronts us at Troy is different from the Mycenean. To be sure, we recognised the influence of the latter in the Mycenean vases (undoubtedly imported) which we find in the sixth stratum; but the native culture of the Trojan rulers is a different culture.' The architecture also differs from that of main- land sites. The origin of many elements of the Trojan culture is probably to be found in Asia Minor and not in the AEgean,5 and so parallels between Troy and Servia 1 Vol. xiv. pp. 319-342 : cited below as B.S.A. xiv. 2B.S.A. xiv. p. 327; Class.

At present Thessaly and North Greece are still comparatively new ground, but excavations have been made at Dhimini, Sesklo, Phthiotic Thebes, Zerelia and Tzani in Thessaly, Lianokladhi in Malis, Orcho- menos and Chaeronea in Boeotia, where kindred cultures have been found. Besides these, several trial-excavations have been made, and it is legitimate to draw certain conclusions from the evidence already before us. In the first place, early Thessalian cul- ture is quite distinct and separate from the AEgean.1 A few stray /Egean objects may occur in Thessaly, but they cannot alter the case, and the Late Minoan III. pottery from this region is only found either isolated or together with the latest of the local wares. The Minyan ware, which is somewhat earlier in date, was imported from Orchomenos and is the earliest sign of the potter's wheel in the north. The early hand-polished, painted wares which are succeeded by a period of degeneration and plain pottery, have no likeness to any southern fabric, and southern influence does not really occur till the very end of the Mycenean age (Late Minoan III.), So a resemblance between Thessaly and Servia does not mean AEgean influence in Servia. Taken as a whole, Thessalian and Servian ceramic fabrics seem to be different; amongst the former painted wares are common and incised rare, among the latter the case seems to be the reverse. Dr. Vassits quotes some Servian ware with red matt paint, and suggests a Thessalian parallel.2 But the Thessalian red on white ware is hand-polished, and quite different. He also mentions one bichrome fragment,3 which does not seem to be Thessalian, and is a slight proof of strong connection at best. Thessalian wares and other objects may occur in Servia and vice versa, but unless the quan- tity found is great there is no proof that one style influenced the other, especially when the differences are so great. Dr. Vassits quotes with approval our sug- gestion that the Thessalian chronology needs revision,4 and points out that a type of unpainted vase, one of which has been found in Thessaly, occurs in Italy and Bulgaria in the iron age. Apparently he would wish to place the upper strata of Dhimini, to which the vase belongs, in the early iron age, and so equate bronze with bronze, and iron with iron. All the evidence, however, is the other way, and no one would dream of placing the introduction of iron into Thessaly before the third Late Minoan period, the terminus ante quem for the upper levels of Dhimini,5 for the evidence from Zerelia seems to show that even at that date Thessaly was still in an Eneolithic age.6 In his interesting account of the imple- ments, statuettes, and pottery, Dr. Vassits. lays great stress on the part played by metal prototypes from the south-east. Thus he holds that stag-horn harpoons and hooks are not characteristic of the stone, but of the bronze age, and are copied from metal hooks and harpoons from the south-east, but appar- ently such metal prototypes have not been found in Servia itself. The same seems to be the case as regards the pottery which he believes to be largely imitated from the shapes of metal vases. Now a large amount of pottery based on metal prototypes seems to imply a considerable amount of metal which, however, according to Dr. Vassits him- self, is very rare.7 If the actual metal proto- types are lacking, how far is it legitimate to argue their existence from ceramic fabrics? Metal vases are decorated in three ways : (i) by incised patterns, (2) by raised patterns, (3) by designs beaten out from the inside. Of these, the first two methods are equally natural for pottery, and without a metal parallel cannot be taken as implying the existence of metal prototypes. The third method, however, if found in pottery is most probably derived from metal. Ware showing this technique has been found at Knossos, and from the same site there are fragments which exactly reproduce in clay the handles 1 Tsountas, ALr~iL KCL Z&amp;OKXo, p. 385; cf.

Here we have both the metal prototype and the ceramic imitation, but are there any such certain examples in Servia ? To judge by his paper on his excava- tions at 2uto Brdo,' Dr. Vassits considers any sharp bend in the profile of a vase to be a sign of metal, but this may just as well be derived from wicker or wooden proto- types. The prehistoric collection of the National Museum at Belgiade now contains, thanks to Dr. Vassits' energy, over a thousand statuettes from different sites. All of these are, with two exceptions-a bird's head from Jablanica and the hindquarters of a quadruped from Vinca-of clay, and so there is no Servian parallel to the Cycladic marble statuettes.2 The solid female figurines from the earlier group of sites are without exception steato- pygous, which is not a characteristic of the }Egean, though it is of Thessaly.s The Petsofit figurines, which Dr. Vassits often refers to, are all painted and for the most part male, while the Servian statuettes which he compares to them are incised and usually female. Throughout there seems to be a differ- ence in the developmentand history ofcostume, for early Servian statuettes of both sexes wear a form of loin-cloth, while in the A2gean the typical female costume is a bell-shaped skirt. In the Klicevac figure, now no longer an isolated example, an apron is still found. On this point he refers to the parallel drawn by Prof. Myres between the Klicevac example and the Petsofi figurines.4 But that this is not enough to prove a continuous AEgean influence is shown by Dr. Vassits' further description, 'long garments enveloping the whole of the lower part of the body are worn only by figurines of the Klicevac type, and only the ornaments of the dress are indicated, not the dress itself, probably because it was thought sufficiently rendered by the shape of the body.' This is again in striking contrast to the narrow waists, heavy belts, and bell- shaped skirts of the 2Egean that in no way follow the natural lines of the body. To support his contention that the Klicevac type originated in Crete Dr. Vassits also quotes Dr. Evans.5 The comparison, however, is not convincing, for in the Knossian terra-cotta 6 the arms are separated from the body, the waist is narrow, and the base cylindrical, not anthropomorphic. He rightly points out that the Klicevac type is not neolithic, though some of his reasons are open to question. In the cylindrical shape of the lower limbs, the flat, solid torso, and in the head he sees signs of a metal prototype, but he does not refer to any of these metal prototypes that he uses to connect Servia and the Agean, except, per- haps, the bronze statuette from the Troad,7 which he quotes as giving a hint of the way by which 2gean things reached Servia. In this example the marked flounced skirt of the Agean type is in direct contrast to the Klicevac figure. There also seems to be some difficulty in Dr. Vassits' comparative chronology. Some of the Servian objects are, according to him, much later than the Cretan prototypes from which he alleges they were derived. For instance, the Klicevac type, which is the earliest statuette with the lower limbs fully draped, is dated by him as parallel with Troy VII.,8 and is thus later than the Knossian terra-cotta compared with it, which belongs to the last period of the second palace, 1400 B.C. The PetsofAi figurines, which come early in the Middle Minoan period, are com- pared with the second group of the early Servian figures, which, according to Dr. Vassits, are of the age following Troy II.,9 but at PetsofAi we have the fully developed skirt and bodice.10 How is it then that Servia, which, according to Dr. Vassits, almost always depends on the Agean for all new figurines and pottery, produced no statuette with the lower limbs fully draped before a 'Mycenean or Post-Mycenean age '? 11 We may then briefly summarise the points we have raised.

The alleged close relationship between Servia and the AEgean is not proved, because Servian fabrics are so different from the Cretan, no actual Cretan imports have yet been found in Servia, the Servian objects are much later in date. The argument of metal prototypes must remain in abeyance till they are found both in Servia and in the A~gean. The Thessalian culture, while certainly non- AEgean, may perhaps connect with Servia, but the pottery in shape and technique is on the whole so different as to preclude the dependence of one on the other. Some figurines from Dhimini and Sesklo may show resemblances, but the differences are far greater; for instance, the Klicevac type -is unknown in Thessaly, and also a type from 2uto Brdo.x Thus for these reasons and because, as far as we can tell, the ceramic fabrics of Crete, Troy, Thessaly, and Servia are so different from one another, we would submit that Dr. Vassits has failed to make out his case.
