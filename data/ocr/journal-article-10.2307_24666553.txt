<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mother and Child: A Late Cypriote Variation on an Eternal Theme* Robert S. Merrillees (Canberra) Called kourotrophoi though made in Cyprus before the arrival of Greek speaking peo ples, the terracotta representations of a female holding an infant belong to a well attested type of anthropomorph, which has recently been the subject of detailed studies by L. Âstrôm, J. Karageorghis, and A. G. Orphanides.1 Unfortunately these surveys of the evi dence have been less than exacting in their terminology, classification, and listing of specimens, which limits their value for comparative purposes. In particular the term kou rotrophos has been loosely applied to figurines, whether standing or seated, with or with out infant, and regardless of their origin, whether Mycenaean or native Cypriote. It is best avoided as it adds nothing to our interpretation of these models and will not be fur ther used on this occasion. Likewise authorities who have followed in L. Âstrôm's foot steps have not been content to use the same typology, which should be de rigueur for all students of Cypriote prehistory, but have devised their own,3 which is as unnecess ary as it is confusing. Finally, the habit of simply listing all known examples without any attempt at reconciling the various references results in a failure to pick up signifi cant new information and gives a misleading picture of quantity, distribution, and date.4 Orphanides' catalogue is in addition marred by numerous typographical and other mis takes. It is with a view to bringing together as much published and unpublished data about these figurines as are currently accessible to the writer that this paper is devoted. It will become immediately apparent that much more research remains to be done so as to make the catalogue comprehensive as well as exact in all respects. The following list comprises those female figurines belonging or attributed to L. Âstrôm's Terracotta Figurine Type 113. Each entry reproduces all relevant details avail able but does not attempt a full description of every piece. * There is a certain poignancy in contributing to the inauguration of a new periodical in Austra lia, which is a cause for celebration, and at the same time to the commemoration of the life of a young Australian scholar, whose premature death is a source of sadness. Tony McNicoll was one of archaeology's gentlemen. He had only just begun to reach his full potential when cruelly struck down. My wife Helen and I shall long cherish the recollection of the time when we last saw him, in his element, at the site of Pella in Jordan, in 1985. As a student of ancient Near Eastern history his interests ranged wide ly over the region, and it seems appropriate to pay tribute to his memory with an article on a type of Late Cypriote female figurine with Western Asiatic connections. 1 See L.

Cypriot Collection (2nd ed., 1981) Case 6. Charles Watkins was Manager of the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Larnaca during at least the 1880s (A. P. di Cesnola, Salaminia [1882] 329; see S. Reinach, Chroniques d'Orient. Documents sur les fouilles et découvertes dans l'Orient hellénique de 1883 à 1890 [1891] 302) and Swedish Consul in Larnaca (see P. Âstrom, OpAth 5, 1965, 155). He helped support archaeological excavations in the island and was also a collector of antiquities (cf. Reinach op. cit. 179, 190.267, 302, 361; J. L. Myres-M.

Bibl.: R. von Schneider, AA 1892, 115 no. 108; L. Âstrom 514. Donations of small antiquities were made by the Count Ludolf in 1879 and 1883 to the Antikensammlung of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, where this figurine presumably now is (cf. CVA Wien 4 [1984] 5). The salient features of this type of figurine have already been well established and do not need to be recapitulated here.

MERRILLEES fact that the geographical distribution of specimens of the type confirms the evidence of the ware, form, and technical features to the effect that these female figurines were made in Cyprus. With the single exception of the one said to have come from Tyre on the Asi atic mainland, all were, in cases of authenticated or credible provenance, found in the island. Even then the example attributed to a source outside Cyprus did not, so far as is known, turn up in scientific excavations, but in an entrepôt well known as a place from which imported antiquities came in modern as well as ancient times ,6 Figurines hold ing an infant or something else have turned up all over the island, from Yialousa in the north to Episkopi Bamboula in the south, from Enkomi Ayios Iakovos in the east to Ka tydhata Linou in the west, with a number from the centre of the island. Those from con trolled excavations all came from tombs, except Nicosia No. 10 (which could, of course, have originally be deposited in the cemetery which underlay the human habitations), and it can be inferred from the provenances attributed to the rest, as well as their state of preservation, that most of the figurines were recovered from graves. In their contex tual distribution they differ little from the earlier, characteristically Cypriote Red Pol ished plank figurines. Given their spread over the island, it is not surprising to find a considerable diversity in the figurines' morphological features. While the majority cradle an infant, a few hold what is possibly a bird (Munich No. 1), one, a tambourine (Paris No. 1), and another, a recipient (Budapest No. 1). All have prominent ears, nearly all with two holes each, but three figurines have three holes in each ear (London No. 1, Oxford No. 2, Paris No. 2). The number of ear-rings now extant is probably of little significance due to the chances of preservation, but the majority undoubtedly wore them. Only one had ear studs, fashioned like its eyes (New York No. 2). There are many variations in details, Ο IP ι ♦ « V ■**'„. .iS" Ills. 15-17. Female figurine.Tokyo No.l 6 See R. S.

The figurines stand stiffly to attention; with legs together, and the infant or other object nearly always held in the left arm. There are no signs of activity except five evident cases of breast feeding (London Nos. 4-5; Nicosia Nos. 1 and 6; Oxford No. 3). Amongst the larger group of hollow examples, most of which are more than 20cm tall, there is little uniformity in form or style, but the smal ler solid category, of which there are fewer representatives, include amongst their num ber some that are strikingly similar in appearance. Larnaca No. 1, London No. 5, and Oxford No. 1, and Nicosia Nos. 4 and 5, Paris No. 6, and Sydney No. 1 are respec tively almost identical and could have come from the same workshops. Nevertheless the extent of the differences in modelling and finish suggest that, despite the relatively small number of figurines extant, their manufacture probably took place over a wide area, if not necessarily time. Nearly all the authorities cited date the/7oruit of specimens of this type to L.C.II.7 The chronological evidence reproduced above tends to confirm this general attribution but suggests that these female figurines were more at home in L.C.II A and Β than in L.C.II C, that is, the 15th and 14th centuries BC. 7 E.g.
