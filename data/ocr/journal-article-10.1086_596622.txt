<plain_text> <page sequence="1">          ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SHIPS OF KZD/RY IN THE ERASED  CUSTOMS ACCOUNT FROM ELEPHANTINE* OREN TAL, Tel Aviv University The Aramaic text from Elephantine known as the Words of  Ahiqar was written over a multicolumn, erased text known as the Customs Account; it was deciphered by Ada Yardeni and published in full in 1993.1 The deciphering of  this text, which has been dated to year 11 of  Xerxes I—475 b.c.e.2 or, alternatively, to Artaxerxes I—454 b.c.e.,3 reveals a succession of  Egyptian months that enables us to follow the order of  the papyrus sheets and to establish the number of  missing columns.4 The text records the dates (day and month) and customs duties collected at the arrival and departure of  Ionian and Phoenician ships and given to the Achaemenid royal treasury during one ten-month sailing season (approximately from March to December). The information from the Customs Account concerning maritime trade includes the types of  ships sailing to and from Egypt and the kinds of  goods they carried as well as information about the system of  duty collection and the royal practice of  accounting in Achaemenid Egypt in the early Persian period.5 Four types of  ships are mentioned in the account. Two types are large Ionian ships; nineteen are related to spynh rbh (large ships), and seventeen are related to another type of large ship with the enigmatic designation aswt khmws spynh rbh; most of  them are identified by the name of  their Greek (iwny) captains (owners?). The other two types are Phoenician ships; three are related to dwgy qnd/rtoa (large boats), and an additional three are related to dwgy qnd/rtsyry (small boats), which are apparently types of  ships called spynt kzd/ry (ships of  kzd/r). Each ship had its own specific cargo and had to pay specific duties: either the mndta, which apparently amounted to one-fifth of  the goods imported, which was paid by the Ionian ships, or the tithe, mosra, which was paid by the Phoenician ships. Taxes were collected (gby) from each ship and “turned (over)” (obyd ) to the royal treasury (byt mlka). This article proposes identifying the term kzd/ry, which appears in papyrus sheet FV3, 25—////// yodr zoko t(w)nyps—“ships of  kzd/ry 6,” as a toponym, namely, the Persian-period site of  Tell Ghazza (Arabic)/Tel Yaooz (Hebrew), which has been the subject of  several recent * I am indebted to Ran Zadok for his valuable 2 Porten and Yardeni, Textbook of Aramaic Docu- comments on a preliminary draft of  this essay; the ments from Ancient Egypt, vol. 3, pp. xx and 23. responsibility for the ideas expressed below, however, 3 P.

Although the Customs Account has been the subject of  several publications, only a few have dealt with the meaning of  the term kzd/ry. Ada Yardeni, for example, wrote: Their [the ships’] national designation is also either missing or illegible and their origin is suggested by the Sidonian wine and cedar wood they carried (. . . the word kzd/ry, the reading and meaning of which is uncertain, may refer to the Phoenician ships).7 In reviewing Porten and Yardeni’s 1993 work, E. Lipinski wrote: [The] six ships mentioned . . . are called spynt kzd/ry (FV3, 25), but the reading spynt ozry seems also possible. In this case ozry could be a Phoenician proper name, the more so because these ships carry Sidonian wine and cedar wood.8 It is only in P. Briant and R. Descat’s commentary on the Customs Account that we find a more convincing explanation for the term in question: L’ethnique des six bateaux appelés phéniciens par les éditeurs pose des problèmes non moins délicats.

C’est une forme qui peut correspondre au kzr du papyrus.9 The identification of  the term with biblical Gezer was subsequently refuted by Briant and Descat because of  the location of  the site some 20 km away from the seacoast and the site’s status and poor archaeological remains in Persian times.10 Alternatively, Briant and Descat suggested that the term kzr may correspond to pseudo-Scylax’s ◊AdaroÍ povliÍ SidwnÇwn,11 and Strabo’s Gadaris.12 The identification of  kzr with Adaros is problematic from both the linguistic and epigraphical points of  view13 and with Strabo’s Gadaris, mentioned in the contexts of  discussing Iopph (Joppa/Jaffa) and its agricultural hinter- land and the coastal towns of  the southern Shephelah, is misleading.14 Strabo, for lack of 6 M.

Given the fact that kzr and gzr are assimilated (since -k- and -g- are both guttural), the geographical name Gazara (Gavzara) in Hellenistic times may be the key to our under- standing of  kzd/ry in the Customs Account.16 The suffix -y- in kzry is apparently gentilic. From a linguistic point of  view, Greek Gazara is Semitic Gazar, the suffix -a- being clearly Greek, and it is attested in other adaptations of  Semitic place-names in the Helle- nistic Near East (see, for example, Dor/Dora, Gezer/Gazera, Gadar/Gadara, and Geresh/ Gerasa).17 The earliest reference to Hellenistic Gazara is found in 1 Macc. 9:50–52: In 161 b.c.e. Bacchides, the commander of  the Syrian army, attempted to restore Seleucid rule over Judah and Palestine (in the context of  the Maccabean revolt) by means of  estab- lishing and manning a number of  fortresses in key topographical positions that controlled the main roads to Jerusalem, including Beth-Zur and Gazara.18 These fortresses were built in towns with Jewish populations and were thus almost certainly perceived by Bacchides as potential focal points of  unrest. The accepted view is to identify the Gazara of  Bacchides with Tel Gezer, although the text gives no reliable geographical details for its location. It is more reasonable to place Gazara, including Bacchides’ fortress, at Tell Ghazza as will be shown below.19 This site-name appears on early twentieth-century mandatory maps of 15 For example, 1 Macc. 13:43–48; W. Kappler, ed., The identification of  Tell Ghazza (and not Tel Gezer Maccabaeorum libri I–IV, Septuaginta IX/I (Göttingen, as generally agreed upon) with Gazara of  1 Maccabees 1936). On this, see M.

It is note- One Line Short </page> <page sequence="5"> On the Identification of the Ships of kzd/ry 5 Palestine, and the place-name Ghazza was based on the way the name was pronounced by the locals, which preserved an earlier vocal tradition. It should be stressed that Tell Ghazza is located in the area of  greater Yavneh (Iamneia), which at the time was populated by Jews. Evidence of  this can be seen in the story of  the punitive raid of  Judas Maccabaeus against the polytheistic population of  Yavneh and its port because it constituted a threat to the Jews of  the area.20 The geographical name Gaza[ra] also appears in 1 Macc. 13:43–48, in connection with the siege Simon the Hasmonean imposed on the town in 142 b.c.e.21 Gazara is mentioned again in the context of  military events occurring in Judah four years later, in 138 b.c.e., while Simon still ruled, when Antiochos Sidetes sent his friend Athenobios to demand the return of  three towns belonging to his kingdom: Iopph, Gazara, and the Akra (in Jerusalem)—a demand that was rejected.22 The identification of  Gazara with Tell Ghazza (and not, as is customarily accepted, at Tel Gezer) is more logical geo- graphically from a Hasmonean perspective because in that location the site created a corri- dor allowing Jews access to the Mediterranean, and it cut off  Seleucid territorial contiguity with the southern coastal plain and with Egypt. Gazara is mentioned once more in 1 Macc. 16:19–21 in the context of  an unsuccessful murder attempt on John Hyrcanos.23 From an archaeological perspective, the site’s fifth-century occupation is clearly con- nected to royal administration. M. Dothan, who was the first to conduct a comprehensive survey of  the site and its surroundings, concluded that during the Persian and Hellenistic worthy that the toponym Tell Ghazza may form a “fortified Iopph, which is by the sea, and Gazara, which Nachbenennung of  Gaza as one of  the dominant sites is on the borders of  Azotos, where the enemy formerly in the region of  the southern coastal plain; however, dwelt. He settled Jews there, and provided them with the assimilation of  the geographical name Ghazza with whatever was necessary for their restoration there.” At Gazara may also suggest that the site maintained its some point Simon transferred command of  Gazara to ancient name, as can also be deduced from the archae- his son John Hyrcanus, as 1 Macc. 13:53 (ed.

It notes that Simon </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 Journal of Near Eastern Studies periods Tell Ghazza was the chief  site of  the Wâdi Rubin region.24 In the limited excavations carried out at the site in 1981 by Tel Aviv University (TAU), headed by I. Roll, it became clear that the mound had served as an acropolis for a larger settlement that extended to its south as far as the northern bank of  Wâdi Rubin and the springs there. At the summit of Tell Ghazza, foundations were found of  a monumental structure decorated in the Greek (Doric) style and dated to the second century b.c.e. On the site’s northeastern slopes, the eastern part of  an open-courtyard-type dwelling was unearthed, with walls built in the Phoenician pilaster style. This building, which had been exposed earlier by antiquities robbers, revealed a limited number of  finds; notable among these are Phoenician carinated- shoulder storage jars, Attic glazed ware, and an incised glass seal in the Greco-Persian style. The meager number of  finds does not allow us to establish a precise chronological range for the building but, rather, only a general date somewhere in the fifth or fourth cen- turies b.c.e.25 A fifth-century b.c.e. date seems more likely. A rescue dig was carried out in 1998 by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) on the site’s southwestern slopes. It revealed the walls of  a structure similar in building technique, plan, and orientation to that discovered in the 1981 excavations and, based on the presence of  Attic ware, could be dated to the fifth century b.c.e.26 Notable among its finds were Phoenician carinated- shoulder storage jars, Attic glazed ware, and clay rhyta, including an almost complete anthropomorphic rhyton (identified as the Egyptian deity Amon-Ra), which, on the basis of  petrographic analysis, was manufactured in Phoenicia, albeit with Achaemenid-style morphology and Egyptian-style iconography.27 In light of  the fact that the two structures excavated by TAU and the IAA are located on opposite slopes of  the mound; are con- temporaneous; and evince a similar building technique, plan, and orientation, the fifth- century b.c.e. site must have been quite a large settlement, covering at least 1.5 hectares and, given the ceramic distribution, may have been even larger. Another indication of  the site’s administrative nature is the distribution of  the pottery. The IAA excavators concluded that the Phoenician carinated-shoulder jar is the predomi- nant type of  jar (and apparently the predominant ceramic find) found during the excava- tions.28 These jars have been the subject of  a recent study, which aimed at investigating the level of  centralization and modes of  production and distribution in Persian-period southern Phoenicia.29 The jars’ petrographic and chemical analyses suggest that they were 24 M.

Bettles justifiably linked the Sidonian wine of  the Customs Account to the Phoenician carinated-shoulder jars, though she rejected their origin in Sidon31 on the basis that “Sidon/ian” was also used as a generic term for “Phoenicia/n.”32 In fact, all documented Phoenician carinated-shoulder jars recovered from Tell Ghazza can be dated to the fifth century b.c.e., corresponding to Bettles’s Types A1 and A2.33 The dozens of Phoenician jars discovered during the excavations of  the site, their petrographic analysis pointing to an origin in the Lebanese coast,34 and the site’s location next to a wide river bank some 1.5 km from the Mediterranean all make Tell Ghazza a probable center of distribution. As stated above, the Phoenician ships mentioned in the Customs Account were divided between large- and small-type ships, that is, three dwgy qnd/rtoa and three dwgy qnd/rtsyry. The ships carried Sidonian wine (hmr sydnyn) that is most probably defined by royal Achaemenid (or royal Sidonian?) years—year 10 in the large ships (toa) and year 11 in the smaller ones (tsyry).35 It may be assumed that the larger ships, carrying the older wine (year 10), arrived at the same time as the smaller ships, carrying the younger wine (year 11), with both appearing on the same Customs Account, because of  a lag due to the time re- quired to load a full cargo onto the larger ships (with the storage jars normally placed in the bottom of  ships), their probable longer sailing time, and the fact that the six docu- mented Phoenician ships sailed only during the months of  October through December. Apart from wine, the Phoenician ships carried in their cargo metals (iron, bronze, and tin), wood (for various uses), wool (two types that are apparently named after their places of origin, kpr so and kpr [·]bn),36 and clay (tyn smws—of Samian origin37 and apparently used in the local ceramics industry).38 The ships’ owners were evidently Sidonian, although only 30 Ibid., pp. 224–26. nician storage jars in Palestine that are marked by year; 31 Obviously, an actual Sidonian origin does not cf., for example, B.

Given the location of  Tell Ghazza on the royal coastal trunk route, which extended along the Pales- tinian coast and beyond,40 and the finds discovered at the site, its centralized administra- tive nature is apparent.41 In summary, the Customs Account tells us about maritime trade in a certain year in the fifth century b.c.e., either 475 or 454, during which time Egypt was a province of  the Achaemenid Empire. Tell Ghazza’s lack of  reliable archaeological evidence for occupa- tion during the fourth century b.c.e. cannot be taken as a mere coincidence. In fact, from the archaeological evidence we know that the site flourished again only in the second cen- tury b.c.e. This is not to say that during the fourth and third centuries b.c.e. the site was totally abandoned, but it does lessen its status in imperial terms. We can infer that both the size of  the settlement and its administrative activities were reduced during these two centuries. de Caunos (261–252), Cahiers de la Revue biblique 38 which is native to Egypt, was probably extracted from (Paris, 1997), p. 120.
