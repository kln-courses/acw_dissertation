<plain_text><page sequence="1">Behavioral Objectives ?- No! Point ani Counteiboint BILL L. FERGUSON Robert W. Blake's article, "Behavioral Objectives and the Teaching of English/'1 is one of a spate of recent attempts sanc- tioned by NCTE to seek help for the real and perplexing prob- lems of English teachers by dabbling in the murky waters of behaviorism. One could read these attempts as the actions of a patient, despondent in his illness and unassuaged by his doctor's treatment, who turns in desperation to the advice of quacks and hucksters. That English teaching is undergoing painful changes is transparent, but to invoke the aid of pseudosience is a doubtful remedy. If things have truly come to this sorry pass and since many of education's ills are financial, then I propose we pin our hopes to alchemy. The use of behavioral objectives in education can be criti- cized from many viewpoints. Foremost, of course, is the psycho- logical theory from which behavioral objectives derive. Behavior- ism, for all its popularity and influence, takes as its basic assump- tions notions which no informed and conscientious teacher of the twentieth century can accept. It is an attempt to transplant the atomistic mentality of Newtonian physics to the invesigation of learning. The learning it concerns itself with is, in fact, condi- tioning and the "learners" are rats and pigeons. To transplant into education techniques devised in the training of rats, to equate conditioning and education, and to assume only a quanti- tative difference between the learning of rats and people are unlikely undertakings indeed.

Or to change the metaphor: it has replaced the anthropomorphic fallacy - ascribing to animals human faculties and sentiments - with the opposite fallacy: denying man faculties not found in lower animals; it has substituted for the erstwhile anthropomorphic view of the rat, a ratomorphic view of man.2 It is sad to see classroom teachers, many of whom sincerely want to improve their teaching, accept the tacit assumptions of behaviorism and the consequent littleness of vision its objectives encourage. Sadder yet is the thought of an English teacher preparation program in which all of its students, in Blake's words, "must write behavioral objectives for each aspect of teach- ing English." Must do it! God help us. Haven't we all been saying for years that there is no educational justification for demanding the same thing from all students? This has been the basic doctrine, consistently violated, of departments of education everywhere. Most sad of all is the possibility that students in such a program will wholeheartedly accept such training and actually use it on their pupils in turn. To justify my lack of enthusiams for Robert Blake's article might require a point-by-point refutation, but the prospect of that approach is too dismal to pursue. Instead, I wish to single out some passages for comment and let it go at that. Blake gives as the primary value of behavioral objectives their contribution to improving instruction. He lists (p. 66) five points to keep in mind in writing objectives, and yet not one of them bears at all on the process of teaching. Instead, they all describe what should happen as a result of instruction. No doubt having a clear notion of where one is headed is some aid to getting there, but English teachers for the most part have always known where they were going. The goals laid out in Blake's objectives (more about them later) are commonplace to the absurd. The problem was, and is, how to achieve these aims or, hopefully, some better ones. On this crucial point the author has nothing to say. Robert F. Mager is quoted with approval and only modest 2 Arthur Koestler. The Ghost in the Machine. The Macmillan Company, New York, 1967, p. 17. 53</page><page sequence="3">54 English Education reservation as saying that the behavioral objectives may eliminate not only problems of instruction, but instruction itself; "if the learner has a copy of the objectives, you may not have to do much more/' Like many self-fulfilling prophecies this one is tauto- logical. When the teacher turns over to the student a list of objectives which state what behavior will be taken as proof of learning, the student can, if he pleases, adopt most of the symp- toms on the spot and quickly learn to fake the others. He can short circuit the learning altogether. What Blake forgets about Mager is that his book is designed to assist the training of as- sembly line workers, not the education of English students. Let us examine now some of the objectives Blake recom- mends. He rightly points out that in teaching poetry, "it is vitally important to proceed from a liking of a poem to an understand- ing of its components" (p. 67). Among the poetry objectives he lists under Affective Domain, however, where is there a hint of how one is to encourge students to like a poem? Pray tell, also how any living student could, "display by his behavior that he has internalized an ordered view of the poetic experience and its importance for a full, humane existence" or any teacher of merely mortal insight so interpret such arcane carryings-on. Many of the recommendations for teaching poetry listed under Cognitive Domain, if taken seriously would preclude enjoyment of poetry for most students. To prepare students to parrot canned defini- tions of figures of speech, of poetic forms, modes, and periods, and of critical terminologies will only perpetuate the worst of current practices and so make our work even less appealing and valuable to the people we exist as teachers to serve. Implicit in these objectives is a view of poetry which is as unworkable as the assumptions behind the objectives themselves. Blake mentions obliquely the notion of a poem's "total effect." But nowhere is there an inkling of how one brings students to its apprehension. Evidently, the behaviorist thinks that an examination of the atoms of poetry will allow the student to assemble them in his mind, add them up, so to speak, and arrive at a "total effect." So long as we approach the study of literature in such a fashion, we will continue to aid the view which has condemned it to obsolescence.</page><page sequence="4">Behavioral Objectives? - No! 55 I do believe that current psychological thinking has much to offer English teachers. The work of Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget is certainly relevant, and Arthur Koestler's seminal book The Act of Creation should not be ignored. What we do not need is a psychology which puts blinders on our theoretical out- look and which narrows our vision of education to the realm con- fined merely to training. Hopefully, NCTE and English educa- tors throughout the country will seek insight into the complex problems of language learning through varieties of psychologies competent to deal with these matters. Let the rats and pigeons have the rest.</page></plain_text>
