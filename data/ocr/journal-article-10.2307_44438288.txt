<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION * PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER One may divide the animal kingdom, considered from a purely utilitarian point of view, into three somewhat overlapping groups. In one class are the animals which have proven so useful to man that he has honored them with a place in his house or barn and dubbed them " domestic." The second category is composed of creatures which although not generally tame, provide a source of food and are considered desirable in a multitude of ways - deer, birds, and fishes, for example. Finally we have animals which are enemies of man, and it is with this last group that this paper deals. For while the phylum insecta includes the valuable bee, and some of its members are important in the fertilization of plants, the word " insect " has come to connote generally an organism inimicable to human welfare - be it a gypsy moth or a mosquito. From the very beginning primitive man must have been bothered by insects of all sorts and have attempted to avoid them. Not that he had any inkling that this or that one carried a particular disease. It was enough to know that their stings caused pain and swelling to a greater or a lesser extent and that they seemed to breed in such unpleasant places as swamps and refuse heaps. So Pithecanthropus erectus probably avoided a marsh when possible, and his Aurig- nacian cousin in Spain and France burnt a smudge at the entrance to his cave lest gnats disturb the palaeolithic interior decorator at work on a wall-painting of a charging boar or bison. The very fact that man is so acutely aware of the immediate effects of an insect bite presents a complication in any attempt to study the history of the understanding of the relation of insects to disease. A person is stung, writes the chronicler, be he of 3000 B. C. or 1800 A. D., the part affected swells and is painful, and the sub- ject becomes feverish. Is the reader to see in these symptoms, (often described without any intimation of temporal relationships), * Dr. W. G. MacCallum kindly gave permission for the publication of this essay, which was written in connection with the second year course in Pathology at the Johns Hopkins Medical School. 536</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 537 merely the primary result of the insect's irritating poison, or an actual syndrome of some disease inoculated by the bite? Very likely the immediate irritation of the bite distracted the physician from associating the incident with the delayed appearance of a dis- ease of which the insect in question was actually the vector. Sum- marizing, man has always regarded insects as harmful, and in the writings of every period one finds ascribed to them many diseases. Now and then someone suggested that they carried well known contagious diseases- the plague, for instance. One can tritely say that nothing was definitely proven until the experimental technique of the latter nineteenth century came to the aid of medicine. The advent of this new era brought advances too comprehensive for the scope of this brief paper. Rather, an at- tempt will be made to give scattered notes on the earlier history of the theory of insect contagion, with mention of a few men, some of whom, had they lived during the years 1850 to 1900, might have been fated to rank with Manson, Finlay, Smith, and Ross. Among the most interesting of the relics of Babylonian civiliza- tion which archaeologists have unearthed are the so-called " seal cylinders " (25). These little clay cylinders, often not more than an inch and a half high and inscribed with the merchant's motto, served the ancient Mesopotamians as seals to lend an official note to letters, bills of sale, and receipts. They date back at least to Hammurapi, (2100 B. C.) (21). These cylinders were also carried as amulets to ward off evil spirits, and from them and from other documents of the period investigators have been able to piece together some of the details of Babylonian religion. It involved two opposing groups of spirits whose influence upon mankind was for either good or bad. Medicine às well as religion consisted almost entirely in incan- tations to this good spirit to lend a helping hand, to that bad spirit to leave the body of the patient. Of the bad demons Nergal, god of destruction and pestilence, is of particular interest to us (16). Under his command were fourteen minor evil spirits, some capable of causing groups of symptoms in humans which modern authori- ties consider identical with certain disease entities recognized today.</page><page sequence="3">538 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER In the inscriptions on the seal cylinders the pestilential Nergal was represented by the likeness of a very recognizable two-winged fly. Ward and others (19, 21, 25) describe several of these amulets, which generally portray the God in anthropomorphic form identified by the appropriate symbol (in this case the fly) beside him. Generally there is a short prayer inscribed around the cylinder in cuneiform characters. For instance, " May Nergal hearken to his name; may Sharnash lift him up." Offord (19) describes another cylinder with a conjuration against " mosquitoes," obscurely calling them to fly away from the amulet's possessor and connecting the insects somehow with refuse. Although the Babylonians recognized several species of diptera and hymenoptera, there is no evidence to suggest that this association of flies with disease springs from reasoning greatly deeper than the primitive associations mentioned in a preceding paragraph. It is possible that somehow the Canaanites, dwelling on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, were influenced by the beliefs of the Mesopotamians to the east of them. Macalister (17) tells us that when the Philistines left their island of Crete and made their homes in Canaan (c. 1400 B. C.) they assimilated into their own culture the customs of the people already dwelling there. The new arrivals at the city of Ekron probably found prevalent there a belief in a local divinity with an established lordship over flies - Baalzebub, " god of flies." The original conception of this god was perhaps in the form of one of the species of insect that plagued the district, i. e., house and sand flies and mosquitoes ; it is not certain that he was regarded definitely as a " fly-averter." Perhaps the god gave his oracles by the movements of flies; Macalister quotes from Lenormant's La divination ches les Chaldéens that the Mesopo- tamians read the future from the manner in which flies settled on an omen tablet and the Philistine technique may have been similar. At any rate the temple of Baalzebub gained great fame throughout a land where soothsaying was a highly developed art (Isaiah II, 6). The oracle's reputation spread among the neigh- boring Jews, and we read that Ahaziah on his sick bed sent to Ekron to inquire as to the outcome of his illness and paid for his idolatry with his life (II Kings I, 2). Baalzebub came finally to</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 539 signify the personification of evil among the Jews; hence his pseu- donym "prince of the devils " (Matthew XII, 24). Macalister believes that ancient Ekron exists today as Dhikerin, near which still stands the Deir Dhubban, or " Convent of the Fly." Probably in the fly-averting Z€vç ro/moç of Pliny (23-79 A. D.) one recognizes a Philistine influence. To quote Philemon Holland's famous translation of the Historia mundi naturalis (23), " Certes, a straunge thing it is of these flies, which are taken to be as sense- lesse and witlesse, yea and of as little capacitie and understanding as any other whatever; and yet at the solemne games and plaies holden everie fifth yeare at Olympia, no sooner is the bull sacrificed there to the Idoli or god of Flies called Myoides (this Idoli of the Painims I take to be called in the holy Scripture Beel-zebub), but a man shall see (a wonderful thing to tell) infinit thousands of flies depart out of that territorie by flights, as it were thick clouds." Bringing superstition even closer to our times, Macalister quotes from the Statistical Account of Scotland a description of the holy well of St. Michael in the parish of Kirkmichael, Banffshire, reput- edly endowed with healing properties. " Many a patient have its waters restored to health . . . But as the presiding power is some- times capricious and apt to desert his charge, it now (1794 A. D.) lies neglected, choked with weeds, unhonored, and unfrequented. In better days it was not so; for the winged guardian, under the semblance of a fly , was never absent from his duty. If the sober matron wished to know the issue of her husband's ailment, or the love-sick nymph that of her languishing swain, they visited the well of St. Michael. Every movement of the sympathetic fly was regarded in silent awe; and as he appeared cheerful or dejected, the anxious votaries drew their presages ; their breasts vibrated with corresponding emotions. Like the Dalai Lama of Thibet, or the King of Great Britain, whom a fiction of English law supposes never to die, the guardian fly of the well of St. Michael was believed to be exempted from the law of mortality. To the eye of ignorance he might sometimes appear dead, but, agreeably to the Druidic system, it was only a transmigration into a similar form, which made little alteration in the real identity." This English heir to the properties of Nergal and Baalzebub seems to have been consulted at least as late as the 1820's.</page><page sequence="5">540 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER Two other of the more ancient civilizations might be mentioned before passing on to Greece and Rome. The Egyptians, with their highly developed system of medicine, considered worms rather than insects to be the instruments of disease. However, their land, traversed by a river which overflowed its banks annually, provided excellent breeding places for mosquitoes and must have been har- assed by insect-born diseases. Therefore it is interesting to learn from Herodotus (10) concerning Egypt that "gnats are abundant; this is how the Egyptians protect themselves against them : those who dwell higher up than the marshy country are well served by the towers which they ascend to sleep, for the winds prevent the gnats from flying aloft ; those living about the marshes have a dif- ferent device, instead of the towers. Every man of them has a net, with which he catches fish by day, and for the night he sets it round the bed when he rests, then creeps under it and so sleeps. If he sleeps wrapped in a garment or cloth, the gnats bite through it ; but through the net they do not even try at all to bite." Finally we turn for a moment to the eastern wing of Indo- European civilization. The Hindus too evolved an elaborate sys- tem of medicine, as detailed in their medical text books, the Vedas. Upon one of the latter, the Ayur Veda , is based that most remark- able of the Brahmin texts, the Susruta Samhita. Tradition has it that this work is the account of a discourse by the holy sage Dhanvantari to his disciple Susruta. Bhishagratna (2) reports that this text was written at least as long ago as 800 B. C., a final recen- sion being made by Nagarjuna in the second century B. C. Hindu physiology has an interesting bearing upon the Hippocratic doc- trines which were evolved hundreds of years later. According to the Hindus, health was supposed to consist in a normal relationship between three primary humours - the air (below the navel), the bile (between the .navel and the heart), and the phlegm (above the heart) (8). In this relation it is interesting to find the following note in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the British Medical Asso- ciation for 1905, when the world of medicine was still ringing with the observations of Ross and other workers on the insect trans- mission of disease. The article is by Sir Henry Blake, Governor of Ceylon from 1903 to 1907, and entitled "Ancient Theories of</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 541 Causation of Fever by Mosquitoes " ; the passages translated are from sections on the pathogenic insects (3). In the course of inquiries into the causation of an epi- demic of malarial fever in Mutwal, a division of the town of Colombo, last year, I received a report from fifteen members of the Sinhalese Medical Association, in which it was men- tioned incidentally that according to ancient authorities on Ayurvedic medicine the chief causes of the disease are im- pure air and water and the existence of mosquitoes. I re- quested more precise information showing that mosquitoes were associated with the causation of malarial fever, and in reply I received extracts from ancient Indian works, among them an extract from Susruta, a Sanskrit work com- piled, I am informed, from one of the lost Vedas. The age of the work is not known, but as it was referred to in the works of a contemporary of Kálidása, the great Sanskrit poet who flourished in the sixth century of the Christian era, thé work is at least 1,400 years old. The following are the passages. They are taken from the Sanskrit edition published in 1873, and will be found at pages 43 and 45 (Kalpasthanam) : - 'KITA. Life-destroying terrific twelve kinds Tunginasa. Mandalapuchchhaka. Vichilaka. Tunganabha. Talaka. Sarshapika. Wahaka. Avalguli. Koshtagara. Sambuka. Krimikara. Agnikita. ' Their bite is as painful as that of serpents, and causes diseases resulting from the three humors jointed together; the bite, as if burnt with caustic or fire, is red, yellow, white and pink colour, accompanied by fever, pain of limbs, hair standing on end, pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, thirst, heat, giddiness, yawning, shivering, hiccup, burning sensation,</page><page sequence="7">542 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER intense cold, vesicles or pustules increasing, swelling, knots under the skin, circles, &amp;c.' 'Masakah (Mosquitoes) are of five kinds: - Samudra. Krishna. Parimandala. Parwaytiya. Hastimasaka. ' Their bite causes swelling on the part bitten, itching. As for the parwatiya, it has similar qualities to life-taking insects/ That the translation should be verified satisfactorily I in- vited five Sanskrit scholars of acknowledged authority to meet at Queen's House. The translation is that unanimously adopted by these five gentlemen, who have signed the ex- tract. These passages, written possibly three thousand, and at least fourteen hundred years ago, are of singular interest, foreshadowing as they do the great discoveries of Manson and Ross. Truly there is no new thing under the sun. The passage is certainly suggestive and concerning it Dr. Gar- rison says, " Witness the Susruta's very recognizable description of malarial fever, which is attributed to mosquitoes/' In this connection, Schroder's (24) quotation from Ernst Schultze's Die Reisen des V eniziane/ s Marco Polo im 13 Jahrhundert is of interest. The great medieval explorer, when visiting the Coroman- del Coast of southern India, found the natives using mosquito nets, of which he gives the following description : " Diese Leute haben eine Art Bettstelle oder Hütte aus sehr leichtem Rohrwerke. Letzteres is so kunstvoll zusammengefügt dass, wenn sie darauf ruhen oder schlafen wollen, sie die Vorhänge rings um sich dicht verschliessen können, indem sie an einer Schnur ziehen. Das tun sie, um sich vor den Taranteln sich zu schützen, die sehr schmerzhaft beissen, aber auch um Fliegen und andere Gewürme abzuhalten, während zu gleicher Zeit die Luft, die doch so nötig ist, die ungeheure Hitze zu mildern, nicht ausgeschlossen wird."</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 543 Turning now to the northern shores of the Mediterranean, we come to Greece, a country which, at least after the fifth century B. C. was ravaged by malaria. Low-lying Boeotia was particularly afflicted. Indeed, in the gradual enervation of the people by malaria Jones (13) sees the chief cause of the downfall of Greek civilization. As time wore on the word i rvpcrós took on a specific meaning. In the Airs , Waters, and Places of the Hippocratic writings we find many descriptions of malaria. The surprising thing is that despite the keen powers of observation characteristic of the Greek physician, and though "Athens was sadly plagued by mosquitoes and other insects, . . . and the Greeks knew that marshes were dangerous, they do not appear to have been in the least aware of the part played by the mosquito " ( 13) . It seems to be impossible to identify anophe- lines as any of the insects described in Greek writings. The fact that Herodotus, as quoted above, thought the efforts of the Egyp- tians to avoid insects were exotic enough to be worthy of notice is perhaps a case in point. However, it is probably not difficult to explain the failure of the Greeks to suspect the part played by mosquitoes. To them disease was evidence of a discord in the humoral symphony, perhaps precipitated by some poison in the atmosphere. Though the patient might be treated by dietary meas- ures, the source of his troubles waś fundamentally an intrinsic one, and could not easily be related to so mundane a misfortune as a mosquito bite. The whole matter illustrates splendidly the truism concerning the barrier to scientific progress laid by preconceived, unproven theory. If ever a people were provided with a first-hand opportunity to study the etiology of an insect-borne disease, the Romans were. Stretching for miles about Rome, particularly to the south, is a region of low-lying land, dotted with swamps and nearly devoid of trees, called the Campagna. How different the connotations campagne and campagna ; the French word conjures up rolling sun-lit farm lands, the other dank, pestilential landscapes peopled by emaciated, enervated unfortunates as depicted in the paintings of Hebert and Maurice Sand. The Romans were fully aware of the danger lurking in the swamps. Even in pre-Republican days elab- orate drainage systems were constructed (as the Greeks too had</page><page sequence="9">544 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER sometimes done) ; and efforts along these lines have been continued up to the present day, when they are being particularly pressed. Whether as a result of these operations or no, during certain periods life on the Campagna was comparatively flourishing. The pre-Roman era, the Empire, the eighth and ninth, and the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries all saw an immigration into the Campagna, only to be followed by an exodus when malaria became epidemic, leaving in its wake deserted houses and uncultivated fields. The general opinion of the Romans cencerning the etiology of the dis- ease may be best illustrated by the following writings by men of the period (5, 9). Vitruvius (first century B.C.), Augustus' military engineer, stated that a city built among marshes but near the sea need fear little from the fevers; " för by means of sewers the waters may be discharged into the sea; and at those times when violently agitated by storms, the sea swells and runs up the sewers, it mixes with the waters of the marsh and prevents the generation of marshy insects " (Vitruvius I, 4, 11). This is certainly a creditable observation, and it is today a custom along our New England coast line to take advantage of a particularly high tide by allowing it to flood marshes that lie near the shore, thereby reducing the breeding of mosquitoes. Columella (I, 4), the agriculturist of the first century A.D., relates that " a marsh always throws up noxious and poisonous steams during the heats, and breeds animals armed with mischiev- ous stings, which fly upon us in exceeding thick swarms ; as it also sends forth, from the mud and fermented dirt, envenomed pests of water snakes and serpents, deprived of the moisture they enjoyed in winter ; whereby hidden diseases are often contracted, the causes of which even the physicians themselves cannot thoroughly under- stand." And finally Palladius in his poem on agriculture (fourth century A. D.) says: "A marsh is by all means to be avoided, especially one lying to the east or west, and, usually drying up in summer, because it engenders pestilence and harmful animals." The Roman satirists, Horace and Juvenal, write of the summer and autumn dangers of the Campagna, and refer to the use of the coponeum, or mosquito-net. It is also related that the Romans would examine</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 545 the livers of the animal inhabitants near a projected site of a habi- tation for pathological changes. To quote Dr. Garrison (9) again, "These extracts show that from the second century B. C. to the fourth century A. D. and after, the Romans had a clear notion of the relation between the fauna of marshes and malarial fever." It does not appear that there was any real certainty as to whether the insects caused the disease or whether they were merely concomitant with the presence of swamp vapors and gases which were the actual etiological agents. If the insects themselves brought the disease, were the symptoms depend- ent upon the actual entrance of the animal into the body, or was inoculation effected simply by a sting? These are points which are unanswered. But the Romans made the best use of what knowledge they had; they avoided marshes when possible and drained them when necessary; they regarded the presence of insects as unhealthy and took steps to prevent their breeding. We of the twentieth cen- tury have added little to these basic principles of anti-malarial hygiene. From these Romans of the early Christian era our cursory sur- vey takes us forward fifteen hundred years to one of their fellow countrymen of the eighteenth century. This step is perhaps not so precipitous an advance as it first appears. European medicine labored most of this period under its bondage of Galenic tradition; Humoral medicine held sway, and, as explained before, it was not a system conducive to research into the true cause of disease. There was required the influence of a Vesalius and a Harvey to instill a new element into the physician's viewpoint. Meanwhile, there was little to bridge this gap in our story. One hears that during the Middle Ages the Moors of southern Spain, before constructing a hospital, were accustomed to place pieces of meat at various desir- able sites for the projected building. The piece of flesh which attracted the fewest flies marked the healthiest location for the hospital. This practice is merely a further illustration of the age- old correlation between the presence of insects and disease. An- other report of interest is that of Celli (5) to the effect that the Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) died from the malaria which ever con- tinued to plague Rome. Just before his illness he is supposed to</page><page sequence="11">546 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER have complained of the mosquitoes which perhaps the sirocco had carried from the Campagna to his palace. The observant Ambroise Paré in his Apologie et Traite contenant les Voyages Faits en Divers Lieux (1585), tells of his visit to the battlefield of St. Quentin (1557). As translated by Packard (20), " We saw more than a half a league about us the earth all covered with dead bodies; and we could scarcely remain there because of the great cadaverous stench which raised itself from the bodies as much of men as of the horses, and I believe that we were the cause of making rise up from these bodies a great number of big flies which had procreated themselves from the humidity of the dead bodies and the heat of the sun, having their tails green and blue, that being in the air they made a shadow in the sun. We heard them buzzing with great wonder; and I believe that there where they settled it would render the air pestilent and cause the plague." Dr. Howard Kelly (14) comments on the passage, " The value and completeness of the observation of this great surgeon is fully appre- ciated when we consider how short a step it is necessary to take in order to make a practical application in the prevention of the infec- tion thus distributed by flies, whether by inhumation or incineration of the dead bodies or by the use of screens to protect the living." One must also make mention of Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) and Francesco Redi (1626-1694). The first of these, a Jesuit priest of Austria, lent a vital element to Fracastorius' doctrine of con- tagion. With the aid of the newly-invented microscope he observed the development of maggots in decaying matter and supposed these " worms " to be a general cause of disease. The Italian naturalist Redi disproved the popular theory of spontaneous generation when he showed that in meat protected from flies by wire gauze, maggots would not appear; whereas if the insects were allowed to alight on the flesh, they laid eggs which eventually hatched. The introduction of quinine into Europe in 1640, together with the increased activity in the field of science as a whole, must have stirred the physicians in regions infected by malaria to ponder over the manner of transmission of the disease. At any rate, there ap- peared in 1717 a treatise most important in the history of insect- borne disease- the de Noxiis Paludum Effluviis eorumque Remediis of Giovanni Maria Lancisi (9, 11).</page><page sequence="12">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 547 The man was born in Rome in 1654 and died in 1720. Deserting theology for medicine, he reached the peak of the latter profession. He became professor of Anatomy at the Collegio della Sapienza, where he is supposed to have come into contact with Malpighi. In his busy life he found time to perform the duties of physician to the Popes Innocent XI, Innocent XII, and Clement XI. (From the last of the three he received the superb unpublished plates of the Tabulae anatomicae of his predecessor by more than one hundred years at the Collegio, Eustachius (1524-1574). These Lancisi had printed in 1714). Morgagni received encouragement from Lancisi in the preparation of his De sedibus. " Er gehört zu den verdien- stvollsten italienischen Praktikern; die Anatomie, praktische Medi- cín und Hygiene verdanken ihm erhebliche Bereicherungen." (11). Dr. Garrison points out his good account of aneurysms and their etiology, and credits him with the first descriptions of cardiac vege- tations. However, it is as an epidemiologist that Lancisi particu- larly excelled. Epidemics of influenza and of cattle-plague drew his attention, but in malaria he found his forte. The interesting thing is that much of his De noxiis paludum effluviis is suggestive of the older Roman authors already quoted. Indeed, it was Lancisi who unearthed and brought to the general attention the opinions of Vitruvius, Columella, Palladius and others on marshy fevers. Prob- ably in many respects Lancisi was not more advanced in his views than they ; but he does take more particular notice of the mosquitoes which plagued the Campagna. " Sed potissimum molestum illud chrysalidum genus, quod venit sub culicum nomine." Perhaps it would not be amiss to quote further a few of Lancisi's paragraphs in the De noxiis etc. as translated by Gorgas and Garrison. Interest is lent to the third paragraph if for " worm " one reads " parasite." Cap. XVII., III. (p. 61) : In a previous chapter, I have shown that mosquitoes (Culices) and other insects make their nests on the water during summer. It can therefore be easily seen that near swamps, where there are so many kinds of organisms and whence their multitudes are thrown into the surrounding air, the water, which the inhabitants use for drinking, is infected with these organisms. Cap. XVIII., IX. (p. 66) : Furthermore, no controversy</page><page sequence="13">548 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER can surely arise among professional men concerning the harmful effect which the insects of the swamps inflict upon us by mixing their noxious juices with their saliva and gastro-intestinal fluids. For, as I have shown above at length, their proboscis is always wet, and, as all their viscera are full of deleterious liquids, it is not possible that the juices rolling down with food and liquids into the stomach, are not there mixed with our ferments. . . . For this reason, we may conclude that marshy insects are highly injurious to the body of man by the inmixture of deadly juices as well as by the withdrawal of the useful ones which are in us. Cap. XIX., III. (p. 72) : Moreover, I take the rôle of a seer and not of a philosopher if I, without experiments, ven- ture to affirm that, in camp fevers of this sort, the worms penetrate and ascend the blood vessels. For it would be necessary that the blood of those suffering from marsh fevers should be let, which medical reason seldom admits; and to carefully examine the blood with a microscope for insects of this kind, if such there be. But, although worms might be seen in the drawn blood, it would still be doubtful that these insects should be considered as the cause of the evil; or whether, which I consider more probably, it is the product of the breaking down of the fluids; whence all the minute ovules, after they have been wrapped up in particles of the blood, are set free or are supplied from the external air. I can therefore form no opinion from autopsies whether these diseases are carried by insects into the blood. That Lancisi was not entirely won over from the doctrine of miasms or effluvia, the age-old hypothesis to the effect that fever was introduced into the body by the inhalation of noxious swampy vapors, the following line bears witness: "An inter animata palu- dum effluvia sint aliqua ceteris minutiora, quae intra sanguina vasa deterius multiplicanda ferantur; et quae fit verae pestis, ac pestilen- tium morborum differentia.,, But one suspects that had he lived one hundred and fifty years later he would have been quick to put his mosquito theory to the experimental test which alone could have proved his point.</page><page sequence="14">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 549 The slim thread of our story now leads us on some eighty years to 1796, when there settled in the town of Baltimore, Maryland, after a somewhat peripatetic career, one John Crawford (6, 22) The subject of discussion for the next few pages was born in northern Ireland probably in the early 1740's. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, young Crawford studied medicine, and subsequently found employment as surgeon on the ships of the East India Company, making several voyages. Marriage in 1778 put somewhat of a crimp in his wanderings, and he became Physician to the Hospital at Bar- bados; unhappily Mrs. Crawford died after four years. Crawford then served the Dutch Government as Physician-General to the colony of Demerera (now British Guiana). The cession of the colony to England in 1796 left Crawford unengaged. His brother- in-law, John O'Donnell, a wealthy Irish- American merchant of Bal- timore whose estate of " Canton " was a noted one, enticed him to America. To quote Dr. Hall Pleasants (22) concerning Crawford, " He at once identified himself actively with the medical, civic, literary, religious, philanthropic and masonic activities of the City. We soon find him Chairman of " The Medical Faculty of Balti- more/' Vice-President of the Medical Society of Baltimore, Con- sulting Physician to the Board of Health and City Hospital, and a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland. He was largely responsible for the founding of the Baltimore General Dispensary, and for the establishment of the Maryland Peniten- tiary. . . . Dr. Crawford is said to have been attractive personally, a warm-hearted friend and a delightful conversationalist." Crawford's varied experience evidently well qualified him for a place at the head of the local medical profession. Dr. Welch char- acterized him as " doubtless the best trained, most original, and experienced physician of his day in Baltimore." In his practice in the tropics he must have observed disease in its most diverse forms and have realized the incompetence of the current theories dealing with it. He was quick to grasp at new therapeutic means. In the summer of 1800 we find that John Ring sent to Crawford from Eng- land a sample of vaccine virus " on cotton thread, rolled up in paper, and covered with a varnish which excluded air." (John Ring, Treatise on the Cow Pox, 1801). Whether Crawford was success- 3</page><page sequence="15">550 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER fui in his use of the vaccine is doubtful, and there is little substan- tial evidence on the side of those who claim for him the credit of antedating in its application Waterhouse of Cambridge, who suc- cessfully vaccinated his own son in July, 1800. Crawford is of particular interest to us because of his belief that a theory of the animate contagion of disease best explained the phenomena of epidemics. This opinion was regarded as ridiculous by his confrères, and it is related that for this reason his principle essay on the subject appeared not in a medical journal but in a local literary magazine, the short-lived Observer financed by Crawford in order that its editress, his talented daughter Eliza, should have " some useful employment." The full title of this diminutive weekly was " The Observer and repertory of original and selected essays in verse and prose, on topics of polite literature." Only one copy is known still to exist ; it is in the library of the Maryland Historical Society. It ran for the year of 1807 only, for in 1808 Eliza found what she evidently considered more useful employment as the wife of Maximilian Godefroi, the distinguished French architect who designed the Battle Monument, the Unitarian Church opposite Num- ber One West Franklin Street, and St. Mary's Chapel on Paca Street. Crawford, whose Remarks on Quarantine ran for several months in the Observer (7), is at some pains to justify his essay as "polite literature." He writes, " It is of the highest importance that the community at large should be made acquainted with what is so materially the concern of every individual, and it cannot fail to be highly advantageous, both to the physician and to the patient, to be united in their opinion as to the cause of disease " (Vol. 2, p. 183). He is quick to explain that he regards disease as a very necessary preventative against over-population, quoting Malthus and others on the horrors which might otherwise follow. That we are so ignor- ant as to the cause of sickness is but a kindness on the part of God. " We are not made insensible of epidemic origin to render us inca- pable of obviating its effects, but in mercy to deliver us from the horrors of its approach and assault." (Vol. 2, p. 249). To another less keen these thoughts would probably have appeared good excuse for avoiding even the mental effort of conjecture on this important</page><page sequence="16">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 551 medical topic. Not so Crawford, for he continues, "As then pre- mature death, and epidemics as a mean of procuring it, are indis- pensably necessary to the conservation of human existence, our sole object should be to exert every power of the mind to alleviate, not vainly to attempt obviating, so necessary an evil." (Vol. 2, p. 250). As already related, the papers in the Observer are " Remarks on Quarantine." It had not appeared to Crawford in his readings and his own observations in the East and West Indies and subsequently in Baltimore that the benefits from quarantine, so rigidly enforced in Europe, were at all worthy of the personal and financial incon- veniences it occasioned. He cites the epidemics of yellow fever which occurred in Baltimore in 1797 and 1800. The disease was accustomed to break out in that low-lying part of the town to the east of Jones Falls known as Fell's Point. Thence it would pro- ceed into the " Town " proper and work its way north, its intensity lessening until the higher ground in the northwestern suburbs was reached, into which it did not trespass. This phenomenon, easily explainable by us of today who can see in the unhealthy environs of Jones Falls an excellent breeding ground for mosquitoes, mili- tated in Crawford's mind against the efficacy of quarantine. The disease seemed to be self-limited to the parts of the town nearest the harbor, regardless of the existence or absence of quarantine regulations. " It has already been well ascertained that no epidemic can depend upon any contagion communicated from person to per- son, and also in the yellow fever, that in no instance has the disease ever been communicated in that way" (Vol. 2, p. 69). It occurs tQ the reader of the Observer that whenever Eliza Craw- ford ran short of copy for her magazine, she ran to her father and asked him for " something more about that old quarantine business." After the first few chapters on quarantine, Crawford proceeded to discuss his theory of animate contagion in a most haphazard manner. His method was to draw analogies between the pathology of the animal, and particularly the insect world, and the pathology of the diseases of man. Issue after issue of the Observer contains interesting but hardly relevant accounts of the vicissitudes of insect life. The example of the ichneumon fly is particularly</page><page sequence="17">552 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER emphasized, and Crawford relates at some length how the adult lays its eggs (i. e., the seeds of disease) in the body of its insect victim, which is destroyed when the eggs are hatched. "If this reasoning is just, it of necessity follows that as the plague of the caterpillars, pucerons, and of all the insect tribes, is the ichneumon, which deposits its eggs in their bodies or in places near to which they abide, which when hatched, prey upon them, either wholly at once or by parts . . . , so the plague, yellow and every other fever and every other disease we experience, must be occasioned by eggs insinuated, without our knowledge, into our bodies " (Vol. 2, p. 50). And in the same vein, " Hence the suggestion becomes more reasonable that our diseases originate in the same cause: That we are exposed to assaults similar to what the caterpillars experience, and that we are in like manner destroyed by worms which proceed from the eggs deposited in different parts of our bodies " (Vol. 2, p. 326). Crawford was quite au courant with the animalcular the- ories of Kircher and Swammerdam, and may have been the first to champion them in America. But he was before his time. " From these considerations, and the suggestion already urged, that no kind of air has ever been known to induce fever of any description, no species of gas, or variety of aerial vapour can be assigned as a cause of epidemics, or a medium of contagion" (Vol. 1, p. 286). To quote a proponent of the miasm theory (and who was not in 1807?) this was merely " the wildest of philosophical vagaries." John Crawford continued to live in Baltimore with his daughter and son-in-law at a house on the corner of Hanover and German Streets ; although he wrote but little, he continued in active practice until his death in 1813. In 1819 the Godefrois went to France, where Eliza, the second woman in America to fill an editorial chair (22), died in 1839. Southward we go now to Columbia, South Carolina, where there was born in 1804 one Josiah Clark Nott (1, 15). His father came originally from Connecticut, was educated at Yale College, and later moved to the south. Young Nott took his A. B. at South Carolina College and subsequently studied medicine at the College of Phy- sicians and Surgeons in New York and at the University of Penn- sylvania. By 1829 he was practicing in Columbia, but in 1835 went</page><page sequence="18">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 553 to Paris for two years, where he not only pursued his medical stud- ies but showed an interest in broader aspects of natural history. The latter part of 1836 saw Nott settled in the States again, this time at Mobile, Alabama, where during the course of the next twenty years he won a place at the head of the Alabama medical profession. In 1857 he became Professor of Anatomy at the Uni- versity of Louisiana, but after a year he relinguished the Chair to found and lecture on surgery at the Medical School in Mobile, an institution made possible chiefly by public subscription. The Civil War snuffed out Notťs new school and we find him serving on the Confederate Medical Staff. Soon after the close of hostilities Nott went to Baltimore and practiced a year there, finally moving on to New York where he became prominent as an able surgical gynecolo- gist. In 1872 ill health caused his return to Mobile, where he died in 1873, much lamented by the many to whom his personality had endeared him. Kelly and Burrage (15) comment that "he was an untiring student and indefatigable worker, ever ready in public or private to advance science." Besides his numerous medical papers on divers subjects, his interest in ethnology which he whetted during his stay at Paris led to the writing of four books on the subject. Two were on Biblical peoples, and two more, published in collabora- tion with G. R. Gliddon, were entitled Types of Mankind (1854) and Indigenous Races of the Earth (1857). Nott refuted the ortho- dox theory of the common origin of human races. If, as was then supposed, man's advent upon the earth was only 6000 years ago, he queried, how in the short time since could a single group have spread so widely throughout the world and become so different in so many ways? The world must actualy have been peopled from several distinct centers. One can easily picture Notťs interest when, in 1859, the Origin of Species appeared, and we read that he was quick to recognize the truth of the principles which Darwin set forth, irreconcilable though they were with the ethnological system on which his own work had been based. Nott seems to have had in him a suggestion of what Professor Castiglioni of Padua, in speaking of the varied interests of the famous figures of the Italian Renaissance, calls the " universal man " (4). For his paper which particularly interests us and which ap-</page><page sequence="19">554 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER peared in the New Orleans Medicai and Surgical Journal for March, 1848, treats neither anatomy, surgery, gynecology, nor anthro- pology (18). Its full title is " Yellow Fever contrasted with Bilious Fever- Reasons for believing it a disease sui generis - Its mode of Progagation - Remote Cause - Probable insect or animalcular origin, etc." The essay is as rambling as its title, but none the less entertaining. Nott makes two principle points. The first is an answer to a paper by Chervin in 1842 which upheld " l'identité de nature des Fièvres d'origine paludéenne de différents types." Nott, after consideration of the symptomatology and epidemiology of yellow fever and bilious or intermittent fever, as malaria was called, concludes that the two are quite distinct diseases. After commenting on the tendency of intermittent fever to " haunt the victim for life," he writes (p. 583), "How different is it with Yellow Fever? Like Roderick Dhu, it scorns all unfair advantage and nobly " tries the quarrel hilt to hilt," and when the " dubious strife " is over, if his antagonist has proved the victor, he may " falter thanks to heaven for life re- deemed " and rise unmolested by the " foeman's clan " ! Nott's principal thesis is one partly inspired by Sir Henry Hol- land's essay " On the Hypothesis of Animalcule Life as a Cause of Disease this latter appeared in 1839 in the popular Medical Notes and Reflections of this prominent London doctor who was hon- ored as Physician in Ordinary to Queen Victoria. Of Holland's essay suffice it to say that it was vague and probably did little more than voice a now quite general dissatisfaction with the age-old miasm theory. (He was able subsequently in the third edition (12) to offer as further evidence certain observations on the cholera epidemic which passed from India through the rest of the world during the first half of the nineteenth century). Josiah Nott, in turn, applies the animalcular theory of disease transmission to yellow fever. Like Crawford, like Holland, his use of the term " animalcular " is a very broad one ; now it denotes an invisible living organism, and in the next sentence it may be the more tangi- ble fly or mosquito. Also like Crawford, Nott had first-hand experi- ence in observing the disease in the course of five epidemics that prevailed in Mobile from 1837 to 1844 and during which he en-</page><page sequence="20">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 555 deared himself to the people of the town by his unstinted efforts on their behalf. In retrospect he first attempts to apply the " malarial " or miasm theory to his epidemiological observations. He quotes Macculloch, as the " ipse agmen of the Malaria party," " whatever malaria may be in its simple state, it is only as united to the atmosphere that we know it, and we must therefore view it as an aeriform fluid, as far as the question of its propagation is concerned. It must be considered as the very atmosphere itself, when it exists ; and its propagation therefore must be primarily regu- lated by those laws which govern the motions of currents of air " (p. 564). The spread of yellow fever Nott found, however, to show a signal independence of the direction of the wind; rather " it travelled from house to house for more than a month, as would a tax collector, and was just about as much influenced by the weather" (p. 564). He concludes from these and other observa- tions that " the morbific cause of Yellow Fever is not amenable to any of the laws of gases, vapor, emanations, etc., but has an inherent power of propagation, independent of the motions of the atmosphere, and which accords in many respects with the peculiar habits and instincts of Insects " (p. 565). Other passages are of equal interest. Concerning the contention that the morbific miasm is generated by decomposing matter, and the fact observed by him that a frost at the end of a summer puts an end to yellow fever, Nott writes " We often have two or three weeks of weather after a killing frost, as warm as that which preceded it, and there is no reason why the decomposition should not resume its operations; but not so with the Yellow Fever - like in insect life, when the ova are once hatched, the propagation of this disease goes on till arrested by a killing frost - and it can only be animated by another summer's sun, which calls from their slum- bering places the various insect tribes " (p. 572). "All the attempts heretofore made to account for the greater activity of the morbific cause of Yellow Fever at night have failed and in my humble opin- ion the fact may be much better explained by a reference to habits of Insect Life. Many of the Infusoria, as well as insects proper, are rendered inactive by too much light, heat or dryness. They remain quiet through the day, and do their work at night. The fact</page><page sequence="21">556 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER is too familiar to require illustration. The moth tribe, the night musquitoes, many of the Aphides, etc., are familiar examples " (p. 581). Concerning the somewhat involved attempts by proponents of the miasmal theory to explain the contraction of fevers at points elevated above the unhealthy marshes, Nott comments, " It would certainly be quite as philosophical (as the Malarial Theory) to sup- pose that some insect or animalcule, hatched in the lowlands, like the musquito, after passing through its metamorphoses, takes flight, and either from preference for a different atmosphere, or impelled by one of those extraordinary instincts which many are known to possess, wings its way to the hill top to fulfill its appointed destiny " (p. 580). And finally, "Though my argument is intended par- ticularly to illustrate Yellow Fever, which I regard as a disease sui generis , still I may be permitted to remark that the present state of facts do not warrant us in assuming identity for all the other forms of what are termed Marsh Fevers, viz. Intermittent, Remit- tent, Bilious and Congestive Fevers. ... I am by no means sure that all these types may not be most rationally explained by attrib- uting them to various insect species, but laying aside this hypothesis and assuming the malarial, it would be a strange anomaly in nature, should it be proven that but one morbific cause of fever is generated over the broad surface of our variously compounded globe. - Fever should have its genus and its species, like other things in nature " (p. 569). Dr. Arnold Klebs speaks in scathing terms of the medical his- torians who in their writings pick out this or that sentence of such and such an ancient who happens to express some theory which modern authors subscribe to, and comment " What an intelligent man he must have been! See, he thinks just as we do about it." In so doing these writers set modern science on a pedestal and in a self-centered way use it as a yardstick to measure past achieve- ments, failing to consider the conditions extant in other times. I trust that in these pages I have not been committing that very sin. This has certainly not been a full history of insect contagion. A man here and there has merely been singled out, biographical notes made, and his work sketchily reviewed. That work must be considered</page><page sequence="22">NOTES ON INSECT CONTAGION 557 in the light of his times. " How foolish of Lancisi not to attempt the experimental transmission of malaria by a mosquito ! How dull of Josiah Nott that he failed to try the effect of careful screening of houses upon the spread of yellow fever in Mobile! " Not at all; the Spallanzanis of the eighteenth century were few and far be- tween; and the Introduction à la médecine expérimentale was a product of the 1860's. The experimental method was not generally available (for biologists in particular) before the latter part of the last century. How then could men proceed? First, by careful observation of what went on in Nature; and secondly, by drawing analogies whenever they might be helpful. And both these methods were pursued. Often one might be prejudiced in or misconstrue one's observations, but that was inevitable. In the Remarks on Quarantine how well are both these methods illustrated. For the first, there is the careful observation of the manner of spread of the yellow fever along the waterfront of Baltimore, and the com- parative infrequency of the disease in the higher portions of the town to the northwest. By a comprehensive analogy with the fight for life among the lower animals, Crawford then comes to the con- clusion that disease in human beings is a similar animate conflict. Thus we have seen that by 1850 insects were accepted by some as carriers of disease. But through the ages, and particularly in these works of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, one can read (or does one read into them?) an inarticulate feeling that there existed a mysterious gap in biology which must be bridged before a real understanding of contagion could be achieved. What of the " deleterious liquids " which Lancisi described the malarial mosquito as inoculating into his victim? Surely the "eggs insinu- ated, without our knowledge, into our bodies " (Crawford) were to hatch no common larvae? Langenbeck and Schoenlein and Da- vaine were pointing the way towards the solution. Lancisi's problem Laveran finally solved in 1880. And yellow fever? To answer that question and all that it connotes is the task to which bacteriology sets itself today.</page><page sequence="23">558 PALMER HOWARD FUTCHER BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Anderson, W. H. "Trans. Am.
