<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hohokam and Patayan: Prehistory of South- western Arizona. Edited by Randall H. McGuire and Michael B. Schiffer. New York: Academic Press, 1982, xxvi + 657 pp. $39.50. McGuire, Schiffer, and several collabora- tors provide a useful source book on the archaeology of southwestern Arizona. Unfortu- nately, the title and publication format are misleading. The volume is a Class I Overview prepared for the Bureau of Land Management, and follows the guidelines for such documents. Class I Overviews are syntheses of the existing archaeological information pertaining to an area defined by management considerations. The boundaries of this study include the Papago Indian Reservation, on the east, and the Colora- do River, on the west. The southern boundary is the international border, and the northern boundary is approximately the Eagle Trail Mountains. Thus the central area of Hohokam development is outside the study area, as is the upland Patayan region. Several southwestern Class I Overviews have been published by the BLM and the Forest Service, and are available at a fraction of the price of this one. The decision to publish through a commercial press will not financially benefit the editors, who have declined royalities, but will certainly discourage purchase by the many professionals, students, managers, and others who might find this work a valuable reference. The overview area comprises one of the archaeologically least-known portions of the Southwest, and one with a literature that is difficult for outsiders to evaluate. There are numerous problems of basic chronology and interpretations of culture history. The remains found in part of the area have been included within Emil Haury's delineation of the Desert Branch of the Hohokam, Charles Di Peso's definition of the O'Otam, and Albert Schroe- der's category of the Hakataya. Major interpre- tative disagreements are imbedded within this terminological diversity. McGuire and Schiffer have done a superb job of clarifying the basic issues and suggesting ways to resolve some of them. The volume is divided into three major parts and includes detailed appendixes. The chapters in Part 1 introduce the scope of the work, the environmental background, the ethnographic literature of the area, and a history of the archaeological research. Due to the extreme aridity of the region, water is a limiting resource, and the authors focus on the marked effects of slight differences in rainfall for plant growth, the different constraints on agriculture posed by the characteristics of the lower Gila and the lower Colorado Rivers, and the diversity of plant resources that were important for agriculturalists. Recent research in paleoenvironmental reconstructions is also included. The ethnographic discussion is not detailed, but it introduces the available source material on the Upper Pima, Papago, Yumans, and Chemehuevi, and uses case studies to illustrate the diversity of adaptive strategies practiced by these peoples. The history of archaeological research in the area provides the intellectual context of the various investigations. This chapter is supplemented by Appendix B, which summarizes all previous excavations and site surveys conducted in the study area. Part 2 examines culture history, cultural adaptations, lowland Patayan ceramics, and Hohokam chronology. The treatment of culture history contrasts the differing views of previous investigators. The discussion of adaptations includes sections on population, settlement systems, subsistence, social organization, and trade, and concludes with a general critique both of Ester Boserup's model of population as prime mover and of common misapplications of Boserup's approach in archaeology. The chapter on Patayan ceramics, by Michael Waters, is supplemented by his contribution of Appen- dixes G and H, which provide a Patayan ceram- ic typology and tabulations of ceramic types for sites recorded by the late Malcolm Rogers and by Julian Hayden. Some will consider Waters's contribution controversial; after thor-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 115 oughly reviewing the historical confusion surrounding Patayan ceramic typology, he defines types on the basis of vessel surface treatment, form, and rim form, which are the attributes advocated as temporally sensitive by Rogers, rather than on the basis of temper, as advocated by Schroeder. The data presented appear to support Waters's choice, and the utility of the classification will undoubtedly be tested in future studies. Photographs of Patayan ceramics are rarely included in archaeological reports, probably because the vessels lack aesthetic appeal. Any past slights are thorough- ly compensated for by the illustrations in Appendix G. The Hohokam chronology chapter is a lucid presentation of the history of chronologi- cal work and current revisions. The chapter examines the work at Snaketown and other locations outside the study area, because these form the basis of chronological statements for Hohokam materials within the area. Schiffer reviews the recent controversy between Haury and Fred Plog on the Snaketown chronology and then presents his own version, which differs from both. It will be discouraging for those who like their prehistory tidy to note that there is currently no agreed-upon Hohokam chronol- ogy, and that those offered differ by as much as seven hundred years. Nevertheless, the lesson, thoughtfully presented, is that the diverse chronologies involve real issues in archaeologi- cal method. Appendix D, written with Edward Staski, and Appendix E present all radiocarbon and archaeomagnetic dates pertaining to the study area. Part 3 of the volume is directed toward management issues. It includes a chapter on archaeological surveys, coauthored by Schiffer and Susan J. Wells, a chapter evaluating existing site files, supplemented by Appendix C (which contains information on the locations of existing collections), and a chapter addressing current and potential impacts on cultural resources, resource use potential, and a manage- ment summary. The chapter on surveys uses existing survey data to argue persuasively for more effective survey design, and particularly for control of crew spacing and consistent recording of scatters and isolated finds. The chapter also provides several useful suggestions for the design of Class II surveys for the study area. The chapter on information in the compu- terized site files (AZSITE) at the Arizona State Museum concludes that these are not adequate at present for management decisions, but that they should provide a useful tool for future re- search. The final management discussion is concise, if perhaps overly brief. In addition to those appendixes already noted, Elaine Maryse Solari and Boma Johnson contributed an informative appendix on the anthropomorphic and geometric intaglios of southwestern Arizona and southeastern Califor- nia. Julian Hayden provided a discussion of the intaglios and rock alignments of the Sierra Pinacate region of adjacent Sonora. Michael Waters contributed an appendix on trail shrines at a site in eastern Imperial County, California, that had been excavated by Malcolm Rogers, and McGuire and Denise Shay organized a useful topical index to the primary literature. It is clear that a great deal of careful and thoughtful work went into this overview, and that it will be essential reading for anyone working in the area, as well as a useful reference for southwestern archaeologists in general.
