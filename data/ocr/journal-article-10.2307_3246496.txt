<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOMENTUM OF THE EPHEMERAL Kawamata's Temporary Structures Yvette Biro Tadashi Kawamata, Les chaises de travers, Metz/Delm, France, 1999. he Japanese artist Tadashi Kawa- mata is one of the most orig- inal installation-artists of the last decade. A poetic radicalism-call it minimalism-defines his work. On the border between sculpture and architec- ture, Kawamata constructs his "tempo- rary structures" with simple wooden panels, waste building material, or use- less scaffolds and creates out of them a highly articulate aesthetic order. Yet we should not imagine that from this cast- off lumber he fabricates a scrap heap or junk pile. The evocation of the entropy, the vision of a pathetic, disintegrating world has been the privilege of the Russian-American Ilya Kabakov [see PAJ 54]. Here we are dealing with an excep- tionally fashioned, artful composition, which nevertheless represents the un- predictable forms of chaos, the random, asymmetrical structures of the inciden- tal. They appear as if they were free spatial drawings-in wood. Certainly, the tradition he comes from, the Japa- nese sense of refined expression and calligraphic economy, has distinctly in- formed Kawamata's gesture. His com- plex yet graceful constructions, placed in contemporary urban space, reveal an ephemeral stability, reminding us of the unsteadiness of this order and the vul- nerability of the modern city's grandi- ose buildings, so often in decay. Tadashi Kawamata, born in 1953, in Mikasa, Japan, earned his first success with the Japan Pavilion for the Biennale di Venezia, in 1982. He has worked in Tokyo, New York, Sao Paolo, and al- most every big city of Europe. Among his best known installations: Destroyed Church, Kassel, Documenta, (1987); The Favellas in Battery Park, (1988), fol- lowed by others in Houston, on Long Island, and in Japan; Project on Roosevelt Island in the East River, New York (1992); Catwalk, Tokyo (1995); Work in Progress, Alkamaar, Holland (1996); Le passage des chaises, Salpetriere, Paris, (1997); Field Work, Hanover, (1997); Haus de Kunst, Munich, (1998); Les chaises de travers, Metz/Delm, (1998). ESPACE TROUVE Kawamata's fundamental method is in- tervention. He works not simply with objets trouves but with espace trouve. I 105</page><page sequence="2">That is, he expropriates public places, using them nonchalantly for his expres- sive needs. Should he gain a commis- sion in Tokyo or New York, he seeks out the most defiant sites. In Manhattan's Battery Park or next to the skyscrapers in Roosevelt Island on "found," aban- doned lots he irreverently built a series of makeshift, miserable shacks, Favellas, a kind of fake?-genuine?-remake of the well-known shantytowns. They seemed so authentic that sometimes they truly offered shelter for the indi- gent and homeless. Was it desacraliza- tion? Not at all, surely, not against the artist's spirit. Operating in real space, deliberately exposing his objects in open places, he causes the real, active response of observers-even those unaware of the origins of what they are seeing-to become part of the enterprise. One of his critics has called his gestures subversive modesty, stressing in this odd coupling the paradoxical nature of Kawamata's art. Kawamata, who, ac- cording to his own words, lives in the various big cities of the world like a nomad, like a "modern urban guer- rilla," has demolished the wall between public and private space. With the sub- version, doing away with the conven- tional division, he questions the opposi- tion of mass-presence and intimacy, order and anarchy. In his work primi- tive constructions meet sophisticated technology, simple craftsmanship con- fronts the large-scale complexity of mod- ern civilization. In another way we could say that the organic pure wood, the archaic ground material of Japanese housing, challenges the soulless, lofty forms of western architecture, as a "poor" counterimage to its heterogeneous, hodgepodge surface. Yes, the gesture is doubtlessly provok- ing, yet ultimately constructive, and the result, besides the breach of order, sug- gests another, new order. Kawamata molds his structures with poetic sensi- tivity. In the Destroyed Church, for in- stance, he placed a wood scaffold on the ruined walls of a church destroyed by World War II bombings, surrounding a startlingly empty inner hole. In this way he forcefully emphasized the contrast between the void and the intricacy of the external frame of the installation. On the one hand, we had the impres- sion of witnessing a normal construc- tion process: boardwalks, pillars, shafts were scattered all about in an appar- ently loud chaotic confusion; on the other hand, inside the space we found an unexpected peaceful zone. The si- lence and the energy of the action collided and-much more-supported each other, lending a sense of liveliness, the illusion of dynamic existence to these odd ruins. The slight uncertainty we felt when seeing these scaffolds could make us question: is it destruction or construction that is actually taking place here? This fine ambiguity was inherent in the work. The installation reminded us of the building's historical past, and it worked as a kind of rehabilitation of the function it once had. Kawamata's works exhibit, even in their massed, heavy-laden forms, a striking gracefulness. Maybe because he unearths the hidden human relationships buried into the objects and space. Or hints at the forsaken potentials they once pos- sessed or could contain. When he turns towards the malady syndrome of today's urban civilization, calling attention to the lot of neglected, dysfunctional build- ings, to the solitude of forgotten ruins, his approach is at once tender and 106 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="3">vigorous. He touches upon and com- ments on the fragility of the human environment: construction and destruc- tion are inseparable, he suggests, but far from being in sound harmony. And here we find the true radicalism of his art: he doesn't intend to create his work for gallery or museum exhibi- tions. Kawamata's characteristic inter- vention occurs in the form of adding, placing, building something similar to the body of given buildings, clearly signaling that they have no specific, concrete function; they are present in order to prick the pride of the conven- tional forms of architecture, bringing into question their stated validity. Chapel or bus stop, ferry or monumental mu- seum-they all are suitable for his con- structive comments. Kawamata addresses the real objects in real action that takes place, according to the rules of the genre, compulsorily in the present. At the same time, his action response pro- vokes equal responses. It happens often that passers-by scribble on or decorate the installations with their graffiti. This pedestrian vandalism is not offensive; since the artist has willingly placed his objects in the fabric of physical reality, spontaneous reaction cannot be alien from them. Anyhow, their destiny is to disappear soon, to achieve a rapid death. One of his later works bears the title Work in Progress, this he built together with the patients of an addiction-treat- ment center in Holland. It was a simple pathway laid out on the ground; there was an obvious therapeutic intention, but also a symbolic meaning to it: a passage that necessarily leads from a given point to somewhere out, accentu- ating in a highly articulate form the beauty of the program. Though the work was made with collaborative ef- fort, even in this experience it was not destined for eternity. The demolition of the artifact was part of the action in the same way as its construction. MOVING TIME Kawamata's firm determination concerns not only the reordering of space; his perception of time is no less ambiguous. His works are without appeal, con- demned to finitude. The cyclical order of construction and destruction is ruth- lessly implemented; the judgment is first of all applied to his own work. There is obviously something disquiet- ing in this shortlivedness. True enough, the installations are still preserved in video form; we can get a picture about something which did exist once, but while watching this recorded stuff we cannot rid ourselves of the melancholy sense of loss, knowing that the work itself doesn t live anymore. [Three vid- eotapes are available documenting his work from TRIAC Documentaire, Paris: Transfert, Lepassage des chaises, Les chaises de travers.] Its destiny has been irrevo- cable evanescence; moreover, this expe- rience is part of the meaning of the creation. The reality of destruction is not symbolic but an unchangeable physi- cal fact. Kawamata monumentalizes without any pathos the momentum of the ephemeral. But his perception of time transcends the mere sense of finitude. The reality of temporality, or perhaps its threat, can be felt in all the elements of the work. Time passes by almost visibly within the structures-not merely in the com- prehension of their transient role, but also from the point of view of their BIRO / Momentum of the Ephemeral * 107</page><page sequence="4">Tadashi Kawamata, Project on Roosevelt Island, 1992.

The vision of the in- tricate, rough-and-ready character of these constructions elicits anxiety: how long can they hold on? Are the seem- ingly incidental connections, the oddly fitting parts, strong enough to sustain the weight? How can they resist time? The installation that seems to be the consummation of the previous series rouses the most this ambivalent impres- sion. With Les Chaises de travers, put up in Metz and Delm, he has literally built a temporary path between the two cit- ies, using only the ordering of chairs, their progression alone conveying the original idea, both outside and in. Out there, the temporariness meant the bi- zarre, the unsuitable character of the arrangement and, of course, the uncer- tainty it entailed: this order seems so odd, it could not be lasting, and tomor- row it won't be here any longer. And indeed it will disappear. Within, in the interior space, the composition touched upon the absurd: it hovered between earth and heaven, an improbable appa- rition, defying the conventional rules of stasis. The antecedents of this installation were in the artist's piece for the Chapel of the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris in 1996- 97, after the exhibitions of Bill Viola and Rebecca Horn. The spirit of the place emanated an overwhelming, pon- derous tradition, since it was here that Charcot pursued his research on hyste- ria and Freud himself was educated. It was the experience of the passage that, in his own words, captivated Kawamata's imagination, the way the chapel offered a kind of transient peacefulness, its function being the place of repose. At the same time, the many-many stored chairs he found there gave him the ingenious thought of constructing some- thing exclusively with the help of chairs, in order to evoke the idea of resting, stripped from all conventional or reli- gious meanings. Kawamata mobilized several thou- sand chairs for the project, vaulting them in a semicircular arch or dome in the heights, "maintaining and denying" the original designation of the chair, its customary function. There was some- thing sacrilegious and tempting in the undertaking. Imagine what it means to perceive a few thousand chairs over your head, suspended in the air: what kind of balance, what kind of assurance holds them? We are to watch them with anxiety, like a trapeze artist's show: well, he is still there, but will he be in the next moment? Is it possible to defy the law of gravitation for so long? And the odd tension of expectation stays with us: what will be the destiny of these chairs high above us in the air, the fate of these chairs at once suspended and fixed, light and heavy. The assumed triviality of the work within the sacred space of the church, the apparent commoness and simplicity-the mini- malism-of the applied material, em- bodied at once subtle blasphemy and elegant momentum: the trademark of Kawamata's ars poetica, indeed. "Chairs are like human beings," he said in an interview, "individually each one has its own history, together they are parts of a collective destiny ... In the Salpetriere the chairs represented at once the place of the rest and the passage. The visitors had the desire to stop for a while in the shadow but also to traverse the chapel towards the buildings of the hospital ... it offered the chance for an ephem- eral architectural expression. To link the church with the hospital meant to in- BIRO / Momentum of the Ephemeral * 109</page><page sequence="6">tervene at once in the functionality and the historicity of the place." [Interview with Michel Ellenberg in Artpress, 1998, No. 38.] In the Metz/Delm version he further developed this motif. Here the chairs were simply set off the highway. They ceased to be mere imprisoned objects; they became mediating "actors." They were lined up between the abandoned synagogue and a twelfth-century patri- cian palace, right on the road, among bus stops and street signs. They became connecting links, practical tools bridg- ing the distance-indeed, bridges in space and time. But could one push away the emerging associations, seeing these two historical, yet worn, land- marks linked with these common, prac- tical objects of everyday life, and brood over their bizarre yet alluring incongru- ence? What kind of past and what kind of present meet here in this unassuming juxtaposition? If the good metaphor, as we used to say, is always an unexpected, illuminating connection between two distant phenomena, in this case a truly bold coupling was realized, with un- adorned polyphony. For this installation Kawamata mobi- lized almost four thousand chairs, an impressive quantity by itself, but his real ambition went beyond this: he wanted to summon the aura of the human presence. He deemed that the good old wood and wicker chair not only hints at the original function, but each one has its own history, bearing the traces of wounds, scars, repaintings, and incidental repairs. The chair be- longs obviously to the class of our most anthropomorphic objects. It serves the comfort of the body and imitates its actual posture. We know its countless faces: from the flimsy weightless to the cumbersome old-mannish, from the pre- tentious official to the cozy inviting. Indeed, chairs are self-contained indi- viduals. But the way Kawamata brought them together, the immense heap be- came a peculiar universe, like durable architecture or living organism. In this intimate coexistence, we see the ges- tures of the intertwining parts as if they were clinging to each other. "There is something almost erotic," says Kawa- mata. Undeniably-and not just al- most. The nearly obscene interlacing of the legs and arms were bluntly manifest. Finally, Kawamata's intention was here, too, somehow to revitalize-reani- mate-these buildings, to make the dead space usable, while the installation con- tributed to the resuscitation of memory and history. Again we reach from the present towards the future, but, as it were, through the interpretation of the past. Since here the customary time boundaries have lost their validity, the different dimensions interpenetrate each other. Both the synagogue and the road, by means of the intrusion of the chairs, have acquired new meanings. The cre- ation has shed light on their hidden or potential sense concealed under their every day fasade. By now Kawamata has been building his installations for nearly twenty years, constructing them in different geo- graphical, social, and architectural ur- ban milieus, but the symbiosis between chaos and order, mass and form-the way the ephemeral encounters the pon- derous-has remained the master para- digm. Tellingly this renders perceptible the inspiring influence of contemporary Japanese architecture. The density and chaotic nature of the Japanese city, and in particular Tokyo, differentiates them 110 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="7">from the urban fabric of most western cities: the crowdedness, the claustro- phobic space, the too-rapid changes all call for constant destruction and con- struction, the implementation of cease- less modification. This experience has brought about the sense of flexibility evidenced in the postwar architects, whose favorite slogans-metabolism, discontinuous continuity, "disappearing architecture," "the architecture of si- lence"-are avant-garde notions that characterized the artist's formative years. The almost unlikely heterogeneous, vola- tile city-labyrinth became the basic source informing his expressive language. The attraction to the light material, along with the fast-break-up forms, stems from the same experience, mak- YVETTE BIRO, a contributing studies at New York University. ing natural the rhythm of sudden changes where the disappearing and the reappearing of things seem the most evident. The few, but recurring, sugges- tive motifs of Kawamata's art-the pas- sages, the pathways, the quasi-construc- tion-all emphasize the idea of the process, because for him, both building and demolishing speak about the vital life of the space. They mark the un- avoidable movement that throbs in both occurrences. And the personal ethos that radiates from his work, though it is at once truly raw and energetic, affects us with its refined aesthetic presence, which, like the culture he is rooted in, creates the ambience of an exceptional delicate balance and serenity. editor of PAJ, is a professor of cinema PAJ, NO. 67 (2001) PP. 105-111: ? 2001 The Johns Hopkins University Press and PAJ Publications BIRO / Momentum of the Ephemeral * 111</page></plain_text>
