(The Native part of this account is copied from the Rev. Thos. Chalmer's copy, which had been written apparently to supply the numerous omission of words in the original copy by Maretu himself. This is the first part of a long story of Maretu's life and work, which practically gives a history of Rarotonga from 1820 to 1840. Amongst Dr. Wyatt Gill's papers is the following, which, perhaps, is copied from a tombstone :?</page><page sequence="4">192 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY " Maretu." " A missionary from Nga-Tangiia, who died 25th January, 1880. He was admitted into the church on 31st August, 1833, and he then took up the work of God. He assisted the Rev. Mr. Pitman in teaching the Gospel at Nga-Tangiia ; and it was he who built up the church at Mangaia Island and at Manihiki Island. Subse quently he became guardian of the church at Nga-Tangiia in Rarotonga. He was engaged for 47 years in the work of God." We do not know the name of Goodenough's vessel, but he himself was one of the early traders to New Zealand from Sydney. The little that is known about him is not much to his credit. He was the first white man to land on Rarotonga, though the island was not discovered by him, but by McCoy, the acting-captain of the celebrated " Bounty," who, on his way back to Tahiti after the mutiny had occurred, and after they had set adrift Captain Bligh, R.N., in a boat near the Tonga Group, the " Bounty" laid to off Rarotonga, and McCoy was therefore its first European discoverer. But naturally McCoy had no chance of reporting his discovery, for after a stay at Tahiti he took the " Bounty " on to Pitcairn Island, and there ran her ashore. Maretu describes as follows the visit of the " Bounty " : " There came here a very large ship, but the people did not land. Two canoes went off to that ship, and bartered some goods from the white people, amongst them the Ande, or ;* they purchased these things with fowls, coconuts, and bananas. As they left, a man named Maia stole a large box from the ship, and in it was found the orange and the mo tini, or . . .* Makare (McCoy) was the name of the captain. One of the chiefs who went on board, named Tamarua, reported that they had taro swamps and young banana trees, besides young bread-fruit trees and many packages of ande, or . . . with stones (? iron) also. They were wild with astonishment at that ship. It was from thence we obtained the first oranges, whilst Kaputini procured a mautini from there." This was in the year 1788, about the month of May. The Rev. William Gillf in his " Gems from the Coral Islands '' (Ward and Co., London, 1850) was the first, we think, to report Goodenough's proceedings at Rarotonga. The Rev. John Williams (the martyr of Erromanga), in his " Missionary Enterprises," of 1846, does not say anything about Goodenough's visit, and hence he has always been accredited with the discovery of the island. It was John Williams, no doubt, who first reported its existence to the world. Mr. Savage has been good enough to look through this MS. and make some corrections.) * Mr. Savage has omitted to fill in what these two things are.?Editor. f Not to be confounded with Dr. William Wyatt Gill.</page><page sequence="5">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 193 The following is the translation of Maretu's account :? " Formerly, in the heathen times of Rarotongan, a white man's ship came, whose captain's name was Kurunaki (his New Zealand Maori name was Kurunape), whilst Tivini (? Stevens) was the mate ; Tiaori, Tere, Taparau, and Tumu were the names of other white men (of the crew). Kaoa and Tino were black men, and Yeretini and Tupe were New Zealanders. Te Are and Tomi were from Tahiti, with their wives Tavai and Tumai. There were two white women named Mere (Mary) and Nati, but there were four white women altogether on the ship. The ship anchored in the harbour at Yai-kokopu, Nga-Tangiia (east side of the island). Their object was to dig nono (a tree plant*). They remained here for three months. That ship brought certain news ; it was told by Yeretini : they told about God, whose name was Tiova (Jehovah) and Tititarai (Jesus Christ). He was the great God of heaven and of all countries?such was the name they disclosed. Trouble grew up with that ship, partly due to the Rarotonga people, who incited the white men to take food, coconuts, pigs, and women. The women were also another cause of trouble on account of their desire for the white men ; and the white men were also to blame because they followed after the women and carried them on board the ship. There were sixty natives engaged in the white men's work in digging the nono. This was another cause of trouble : Yeretini (the New Zealander) and Te Are (the Tahitian) went with the Nga-Tangiia and Te Au-o tonga people to make war on Aro-rangi (at the west side of the island). Te Are shot at some of the Aro-rangi people and killed four of them. Then Yeretini took the gun in order to fire on the body of the people who were on the mountain standing close together and in a line. Tua-ivif asked Yeretini if the bullets would reach them ; he replied, ' One shot will kill them all ; not one will live ? ' Then said Tua-ivi, 6 Do not shoot at them ; they are relatives of mine.' That was the end of it ; the war-parties returned home?there were four people killed on that day. There was a man named Tupe (a New Zealander) from the ship, who dwelt ashore with the son of the chief Pa ; he had married a native woman. He taught the Rarotongan people a method, or laid a scheme, by which the white men could be killed. One of the Rarotonga men, named Kurikuri, a relation of Pa, disclosed this scheme to the officers of the ship. Then some of the white men came ashore at early dawn ; and when * The nono is the Morinda citrifolia, a shrub, the wood of which is yellow and of no use. Rev. W. Gill suggests that G-oodenough mistook it for Sandlewood, and hence his collecting it. t This man, Tua-ivi, was Makea Tua-ivi of the Karika family.</page><page sequence="6">194 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY they reached Turangi, the village where that man Tupe was staying, they called out, ' Tupe ! ' Tupe got up and came outside the house, when (the white men) caught him and killed that New Zealander, and then the party returned to the ship. This was the commencement of the trouble with that ship that stayed at the island. (Another trouble was) the nono growing in front of the marae about to be dug up by the white men ; the people became angry at the defilement, or desecration, of the marae ; the food was taken right up to Arai-te-tonga, belonging to Makea Tinirau. The store-house of coconuts belonging to Makea was taken away to Nga-Tangiia to be placed on the ship by the men who had charge of that store-house. When Rupe learned this he was sorry on account of his elder brother's (property), and he followed up the white men with the coconuts, overtaking them at Titama, where they were resting, the white men and the man carrying the coconuts. Rupe said to the men that two of the white men should be killed?Tiaori and Tere?those were the ones to be killed. Rupe came to Turangi and entered the house of Tupe (NewZealander) and asked for an axe. " Give me the axe ! I am going to cut some wood." He did not disclose his intention to kill the white men. He took the axe, and when he had reached Avana, at Kai-reva. where was the house of Te Ika-moe-ava, he found Yeretini (the New Zealander) at the door, drunk with the native kava, and two Rarotonga women cleaning his head of lice. Rupe called to him, ' O Rangi ! ' and when he (Yeretini) turned his head to Rupe, the latter made a blow at his neck and cut off his head, the body falling another way. This man (? Yeretini) was a fine man and a brave one, with a tattooed face, a son in-law of the natives, who gave him the name of Rangi. Rupe did not lament or condole with their daughter (she was probably a niece of Rupe, daughter covers much more than one's own daughter) named Rangi uira, who was the wife of Yeretini. He turned the body of the man over into the house. Just then Tivini, the mate, and Taparau (white man) arrived on the scene, and called out to Rangi (? Yeretini). Rupe came forth from the house and struck at Taparau with the axe ; he fell down dead, whilst Tivini made off for the ship ; Rupe gave chase but did not overtake him. Tivini fired at him, but had no ball in his gun. So Tivini escaped, and getting into the boat went off to the ship, where he reported that the white men had been killed ashore. Great fear now came upon the natives who were working for the white people on board the ship lest they should be killed (in revenge). But the white men did not attempt to harm them. Now this was the cause why the white men were killed?the plundering of ? the coconut store-house of Makea; hence was Rupe enraged and killed the white men, as he said (he would do) to the man</page><page sequence="7">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt GUI's Papers. 195 at Titama. He followed them up to Matavera, where he found Tere and killed him ; his body was cut up and eaten. Then he followed on to Pouara, where he caught another, Tiaori, whom he also killed ; his body was stolen by the heathens and eaten. When the chiefs Pa and Kainuku heard of this they were very angry. They were told it was on account of the taking of the coconuts from Makea's store-house. When Moe-itiki-oki heard that some white men had been killed, he killed the white woman Nati ; he ate this woman who was staying (as a guest) in his house. ' Alas ! the heathen ? ' There was no compassion shown to this fine woman. She was the fourth one of the white people who had been killed?three men and one woman. Veretini, the New Zealander, made the fifth. When evening arrived, the white men came ashore to fight. The people of Nga-Tangiia and Avarna had hidden themselves in the forest. The boat landed with the white people to catch them ; one named Tumu (white man) brought with him his gun and shot a native named Kitikiti-akiri, who fell down dead. The people had fled inland, taking with them to the mountains their goods and their gods, and stayed there six days. Then the arikis, or high chiefs, came forth to make peace offerings?pigs, kava, and food?to fetch the officers ashore. Then they saluted the white men by rubbing noses, and carried some nono to the ship. After this had been done, the white men paid the natives who had been working for them, and sent them ashore. When the ship sailed away they took with them Tapairu-ariki, Mata-kava-au, and Kupauta, the two former of whom they left at Aitutaki Island, whilst Kupauta was taken on to Panape (Ponape of the Caroline Group, north-west Pacific), where he was left and where he learnt the word of God, and from there, it is said, he was returned and left at Tupua'i Island, where he married two women, and afterwards died there." (Here ends Maretu's account of these proceedings. We have altered in translation the position of two of the paragraphs, as they were not in their proper order in the original.) Amongst Dr. Wyatt Gill's MSS. is the following song, which bears on the above events and mentions many of the names. As it was evidently composed at the time of Goodenough's departure, it is valuable as a confirmation of the foregoing. E AKATARA, NO TE TAMAINE A RUPE I TE RIROANGA Kl TE PAI O KURUNAKI.

(It is hardly worth while translating this song, for it only embodies what has already been translated in the story. It is a lament by Rupe and his family for Tapairu and her friends who were carried off. It tells of the deeds of the Europeans seizing the food, etc., desecrating the maraes?how they were killed, etc. ; how certain men were killed with the rakau-kava (gun) ; and mentions places where the events happened. ?Stephen Savage.)

[Translation oe No. 14.] A WORD ABOUT CANNIBALISM AT RAROTONGA. Written by Maretu, 1873. Translated by S. Savage. SOME people say that cannibalism in Rarotonga is due to an acquired taste for man's flesh. It is not so. It was on account of acts of arrogance, spiteful oppression and sacrilege, that revenge was sought for, or taken, and human flesh eaten. The ariki, or high chief, never had human-ovens ; it was only the warriors and those below the rank of chief who indulged in such ovens. The arikis would not countenance the eating of human flesh?they discouraged such acts. No chief would eat of human flesh lest the example would be followed by the people, and thus they would acquire an unsatiable craving for such flesh ; that is the reason why the chiefs would not eat it, lest the craving would become so great that there would be no satisfying it?it would become a habit, and the people would soon kill one another and very soon all men would be killed (consumed). The fat of man was delicious ; it had not the strong taste or smell of pig-flesh or fish ; human flesh was not strong but very sweet. This was the reason why the chiefs would not eat of that flesh lest the craving for it afterwards became- ungovernable. No one ate human flesh during times of peace ; only when war prevailed. To eat human flesh during times of peace was a grave offence against the arikis, and any person so offending would be condemned. In the case of any person killed in times of peace, by another, for the purpose of a feast, the arikis sent their karere (messenger) to give notice that the body was to be conveyed to the shrine of the god Tangaroa, at Vai rota1 (spelt by most Rarotongan historians as Vaerota),*4 as an offering * Vaerota must be right for the Maoris of New Zealand know the name as Waerot?, and it is that of one of their ancestral homes north-west of Fiji. The numbers in the text refer to notes at the end.?Editor.</page><page sequence="14">202 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY to that god, and in place thereof pigs and kava-ata2 were ordered to be substituted at the feast, for to eat human flesh during times of peace was a breach of the ariki law; anyone offending would be acting in defiance of the rule of the arikis and chiefs. As far as our knowledge goes back (that is to say of events that happened on Rarotonga) the first eating of human flesh in Rarotonga occurred in the days of Tangiia and Tutapu ; * it was in consequence of the arrogance and hatred of Tutapu, who desired to kill Tangiia, and who followed the latter from Tahiti to Mauke Island ; from there Tangiia fled to Atiu Island, to which place Tutapu followed him ; and then Tangiia departed to Aitutaki Island followed by Tutapu. From thence Tangiia sailed away to Porapora Island of the Society Group, to which place Tutapu followed him. Here Tangiia became possessed of a great fear. It was at this island that he elected an ariki, or high chief, over his people named Pa (or Tai-te-ariki, the son of Iro?Maori, Whiro), besides minor chiefs, and the company of priests, that is, More, Tangara, Potiki-taua, and Tara-mai-te-tonga. He also appointed warriors to guard the bows of his canoe. Then Tutapu arrived. Tangiia then departed to the S.E. (runga?east), and on his arrival at Maketu3 he met with Karika, who was on a war expedition (from Manuka or Manu'a of Samoa Group).f Karika saw that Tangiia's people were numerous, and therefore he was afraid to attack him, and gave his daughter, Te-mokoroa-ki-aitn to Tangiia as a wife. Tangiia conceded the Au, or supremacy to Karika ; but the chiefs on Tangiia's canoe would not permit this, and one man (named Pou-te aria) seized the Au (or token of supremacy) from the hand of Tangiia and threw it into the sea.4 Karika was angry at this, and therefore Tangiia gave him his pare-kura5 (scarlet head-dress) as compensation for the Au?which the chiefs on Tangiia's canoe would not allow to be given to Karika. Karika then proposed that they should go in search for a land? Tangiia's people were 400 (e rua rau, which means twice 200), whilst Karika's were 140 (okoitu, means twice 70). Karika said to Tangiia, "You proceed to the west, I will go to the east." So Tangiia came away on his search (to the land he had been told of by the gods), and at night he dipped his hand into the water (and found it cold). He said to his people, "Karika has deceived us, with a purpose so that we might perish in the ' Tai-rua-koko ' " (the ocean of great waves believed by the Rarotongans to lie to the south of their island ; other historians say that this was a great whirlpool). * The mean number of generations from Tangiia to the year 1900, is twenty six, which would make him to have flourished about the year 1250.?Editor. f Karika had been driven away from Manuka on account of his arrogance.? S. Savage.</page><page sequence="15">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 203 " Let us return to the sun-rise." So they finally arrived at the land, (to which Tangiia gave the name of Rarotonga, because of the south westerly course they had been deluded into following by Karika,6 which led them to the ' Tai-rua-koko,' on account of his anger at the loss of the Au. It was a south wind that brought them to the land, and hence is the origin of the name Rarotonga (west and south). He gave the name of Te-ava-tapu-ki-Avaiki to the entrance where they came through the reef, another name of which is Te-ava-rau.7 The canoe anchored at Te Miromiro, and then they commenced to build the maraes. When they got as far as Avarua, Tutapu arrived at Nga Tangiia. Two men named Ue8 (Uenga) and Tautenga went off to search for Tangiia and found him at Avarua. He enquired of them, "Where is Tutapu? " The two men answered, " He is here. He is searching for you to kill you." Tangiia then said to them, " Return, and tell Tutapu it is to be peace, not war; the war is at an end." So they returned to Tutapu and told him what Tangiia had said to them?it was to be peace. Then Tutapu replied, "By this time to-morrow his head will be cut off by my great and thirsty spear." In the morning Tutapu went to look for Tangiia, and they met at Tapae, and the former attacked Tangiia, but he was defeated by the latter. By this time Karika (had arrived and) had joined his forces to those of Tangiia, and Tutapu was routed by Tangiia9 and Karika, and when the fighting reached Mataroa one whole company of Tutapu's warriors was killed. Tutapu fled, and Tangiia at once followed to take him, and during Tutapu's flight his neck ornaments (wreaths) fell off at Te-atu-kuri, and hence that part of the land was named Kiikii (the name of the neck ornaments). The fighting now became severe, and all Tutapu's warriors were done for ; they reached Matavera where Tangiia and Karika planted coconut-trees to commemo rate the victory. Then Tangiia arranged with Karika that the latter should go by the shore, whilst he went by the inland road with his men (along the Ara-nui-o-Toi). By the time they arrived at Pouara all Tutapu's braves had been disposed of except one named Potu kura. Tangiia succeeded in killing him, and none were now left but Tutapu, who fled to the mountains whilst Tangiia followed after to catch him. Tangiia threw a spear at him but struck him on the back and it glanced off. Tutapu then fled seaward, but was overtaken by Tangiia, who again thrust at him with his spear and wounded him in the heel,10 hence is this place called Te-toka-tapaia?" killing of the man." Tutapu now ran off to Nga-Tangiia so that he might reach his canoe and be saved, but Tangiia followed him at once, when he turned to the mountain again, and was overtaken by Tangiia at that part of the stream at Avana, called Vai-kura (Ruddy-water?it got this name from the fact of Tutapu bathing his wounded foot there ; the blood</page><page sequence="16">204 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY flowing from the wound caused the water to turn red), where Tangiia (presumably after killing his enemy) dug out his eyes and swallowed them. (See note.) Then the gods in the heavens spoke, saying, "Thou art an arili who eats too soon, O Tangiia." Tangiia replied, " Why should I not eat at once, O my god ? Until what time shoxdd he be left ? His pursuit of me has reached even to Hades (po). This is the Po, 0 my god ! " One of the names given by Tangiia to this land was Te-po-Rarotonga. The eyes were then offered to the gods, whilst the body was taken down to the seashore. They then proceeded to cook the body "in the umu, or steam-oven, using hard-wood as firewood to cook Tutapu. When the oven was uncovered, the body was not cooked ; it was underdone (i.e., had not been altered by cooking?it was not warmed by the fire). The name of that place was consequently called Mata-veravera. The body was then taken to Matavera (Rangi-atea) and there cooked again, but it was not done. Then Tangiia and Karika both went on to Avarua, taking the body with them. There had thus been two ovens, neither of which had cooked the body. Karika now asked Tangiia, " Who is the foremost man in your canoe ? " (What Karika asked was : " Who takes precedence in your tribe?") To which the latter replied, " Kaukura." 11 "Where is he?" "At Takutea." Karika then said, "Let him be fetched ; he has the proper formula that will cook the body because he (Tutapu) is an arikiV (The body was tapu, or sacred, and until the sacredness of #r?/h'-ship had been removed, the body would never be cooked.) Tangiia therefore sent off Te-Ariki-Tara-are (probably means Potiki taua, for Te-Ariki-Tara-are was not yet born), Tangiia-au, Keu-karakia, and Te-Akatauira. They did not find Kaukura at Takutea but at Aitu (? Atiu). On their return they found Tangiia and Karika, who had removed to Ar?-rangi, where Kaukura followed them and found them at Tokerau; they met at Inave. Kaukura asked of Tangiia, "In what way did you two proceed to cook Tutapu, seeing that the oven would not cook him ? " Tangiia replied, " Just in the ordinary way." "That is why it would not cook." They then carried Tutapu to Vai-kura (Vaia-kura) and there cooked him again ; the firewood used was the ngatae* (the coral tree), and finally Tutapu was completely cooked; hence is that place called " The-cooking-of-Tutapu." The reason why they succeeded this time was that the harahia (or incanta tions) were used, but first of all the sacredness of ariki-ship must be removed?whilst that remains the body is sacred to his gods. Kaukura then said to Tangiia, " You now see he was an arilci ; first use the karakia and then cook." Now that Tutapu was cooked he was * I think the writer has made a mistake, for huru was the wood used, that is, wood of bread-fruit tree.?S. Savage.</page><page sequence="17">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 205 eaten. That is the custom of cannibalism. That was the first cannibal oven in Rarotonga.* When the population got to be many in Rarotonga then wars commenced. The first great war in Rarotonga was that fought between Tangiia and Karika against Tutapu ; afterwards measures had to be taken so as to prevent arrogance and causes for revenge lest hatred spring up between the people, one towards the other. The laws of God are the same ; rebellion was punished and the ignorant and arrogant heathen were induced to forsake those ways and become docile and meek. There was another instance when cannibalism was indulged in on a large scale in later days, when the people of Nga-Tangiia and Te-au-o-tonga became as persons bereft of reason and went like animals to Arorangi, f the arikis went followed by the chiefs and the women and children ; they went not for the purpose of fighting, they just went, without reason. Some historians say that Pa-ariki committed an offence against the god Tangaroa, that he had taken the sacred girdle belonging to Tangaroa to Tinomana-ariki, because that arihi had begged him to give him a maro (girdle). (Tinomana was the high chief of Arorangi, the direct descendant of Tangiia-nui.)* Pa took this girdle and gave it to Tinomana. That was the sin committed that made the people leave their homes ; they had no desire to remain at their homes, they seemed to be bereft of all reason. When all these people had arrived in Arorangi, the people of that place treated them as pet pigs, that is to say they were treated as slaves, and they were divided among the people of Arorangi?each section of people had their share and each family had theirs divided out to them in turn? thus eajh man or family in that district had a certain number of captives or pet pigs to slay and eat when they choose. It was at this period that a great famine came over the land and the people started to eat human flesh ; each household killed some of their captives and ate them. There was no war?simply killing and eating. The people used to sit in their houses and mourn, and made no effort to save themselves. They simply said : " What can we do ; we are like mad people and are captives." They mourned for something to happen or someone to save them, but there were none ; they had become foolish and were now captives. (The word ahiree means captive or pet pig.) When Pa saw what was happening to his people, that they were being killed and eaten, he fled one night to Nga-Tangiia, and he was pursued by a body of warriors. Pa fought them and won ; certain warriors of his tribe (who had not gone to Arorangi) joined him, and * This may have been the first to the writer's knowledge, but there were cannibal feasts here before Tangiia came.?S. Savage. f All the chiefs did not go, only the Pa family and the chiefs in his division.? S. Savage.</page><page sequence="18">206 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY with Pa at their head made war. At this time the great tribe (Takitumu-te-nu-roa) had lost its prestige ; they had lost many of their tribe. Pa and his warriors attacked their enemies, but were driven back. They retired in great anger, and after a time again attacked and were victorious. Most of the warriors who fought with Pa were wounded, receiving many spear thrusts, and only eighty unwounded warriors were left. They retired to the mountain at Piako. Puru (a warrior) went to Ati-kura and camped there ; he had been wounded by a korare (spear). He stayed here until his wounds healed and then joined the war-party again. In the end the great tribe of Puai-kura Arorangi was overthrown, and Pa and his warriors descended into their settlement and led the people away captives like a pack of animals ; they did not kill them then, but led and drove them like a herd of cattle?men, women, and children. They took one of the arikih wives as a pet pig, tied her up like a pig, and drove her along the road ; they led her to Piako and killed, cooked, and ate her there, besides killing a large number of the other captives and eating them in revenge for those of their own tribe who had been killed and eaten at Arorangi. The reason why these people were killed and eaten was revenge. When peace was made, man-eating ceased, but when war commenced, human flesh was again eaten. After a fight, the Takitumu tribe always assembled at Pu-kuru-vaa-nui (see note12). After prayer to the gods, the bodies of the slain were conveyed to Yaerota and buried in the ground at Paetae (Paetai, for there they had made special holes in which to place the bodies. The bodies were left in these holes for two days, until they were softened, and until the fighters had arrived at the general feasting place, when the bodies were again taken up and taken away and eaten ; because they were of the people on whom revenge was sought. If a man was killed and no one hated him, his body was buried and not eaten. From that time word has been handed down from father to son in each family of the acts that took place at Arorangi ; of the killing and eating of some relation during their captivity there whilst they were bereft of reason. Word was passed to each generation to seek satisfaction. I myself have seen my father's human oven. There were four of Ngati-Kati killed by Ngati-Manea at Arorangi, and four of Ngati-uinga were the payment for those four, including a lot of children. I have actually seen cannibalism, for some of our family gave us some human flesh to eat from that oven, and instructed us never to forget that revenge was to be taken by us. In consequence the people of Arorangi were chased to the mountains (Maunga-roa), and it was whilst they were there living in their fort that the Word of God was brought to this land, which saved them from revenge.</page><page sequence="19">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 207 It was through revenge that Tute (one of the New Zealanders of Goodenough's ship, 1820) was eaten ; he took his Rarotongan wife on the ship after having committed a sacrilege ; he seized upon pigs, the property of several people, even as far as Arai-te-tonga, where Makea metua lived. He seized all that ariki's coconuts and carried them off. This ariki lamented loudly for the loss of his property, but the avenger came?Rupe was the avenger who killed Tute for his act of sacrilege. The arikis said that the body was to be buried, but the avenger Rupe waited until night and then he came along and took the body and ate it.* The generality of people did not eat human flesh, but the human ovens were indulged in by the warriors (who ate the contents) ; the arikis and the principal people (i.e., all high chiefs) of the island did not do so?they had their hogs, fish, and fowls to eat. It was fortunate that the arikis and chiefs were not cannibals, or all men would have been eaten ; because man's flesh is delicious to eat and the desire of it would have become overpowering, if human flesh had been generally eaten. It is not of a strong taste or strong smell like hogs and fish. Human flesh was very rich, especially the thighs and regions of the kidneys, and human flesh was very fattening. The arikis would never partake of human flesh, to eat such was even an offence against them, moreover it was an offence against the gods Rongo-ma-tane and Tangaroa in the heavens. There is only one occasion in which the gods joined in a human feast or approved of it and that was when Tangiia hastily swallowed the eyeballs of Tutapu, when the gods Rongo-ma-tane and Tangaroa reproved him and said he should first offer them their share?theirs was the first offering ; that is why they reproved Tangiia.* There were not many places of refuge when fighting took place ; it was generally in the open, and there the people gathered together for strength. Whilst peace lasted, no person was seized upon and killed, for such an act was a breach of the authority of the ariki and the chiefs ; in case anyone was killed, a messenger would be sent by the arikis to take the body to the shrine of Tangaroa at Yaerota, and in place thereof hog and kava-ata were partaken of. There were other kinds of wars?that is war by angry words one to another ; one man would goad another on until words of great anger passed between them?they would have patience until the ariki would declare war ; they would then meet in proper battle. The warriors themselves never commenced a war, the ariki was the one who declared war ; then evil would spread over the land and the many buried wrongs would be revived, old hatreds would be remembered. That is all I remember. * See paper No. 13.</page><page sequence="20">208 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY NOTES. [A word about Cannibalism.] 1. Vairota: This should be spelt Vaerota, this is a marae on the rocky shore on the eastern entrance to the Nga-Tangiia Harbour or Avarau. The marae proper was destroyed some years ago by a hurricane which swept over it, and totally destroyed it. Victims for sacrifice used to be taken here and hung up by the heels on the iron-wood trees, and the blood allowed to run on the sand. The old people tell me that the sand here turned quite red because of the quantity of blood that had been spilt. It was one of the great maraes of Raro tonga. Kai nuku-ariki was the custodian of this marae. 2. Kava-ata: The kava-ata was the fully matured ?cava plant, which had grown such large tops that they had to be propped up the same way as tomatoes are treated. The drink made from this was full-flavoured, and always enjoyed when partaken of. 3. Maketu : This Maketu was not the Island of Mauke, it was the name of one of the islands in the Pau-motu Group. The place called Maketu, on Mauke Island, is only a large stone, which had been used as a hearth stone. I think Col. Gudgeon mentions this stone in one of the numbers of this Journal in Notes and Queries. Te Rei and Vakapora say that Maketu was an island in the Pau-motu Group, and that Tangiia never met Karika at Mauke. I hope to be able to translate my version of this meeting very soon. 4. Tangiia offering the Au or supremacy to Karika : All the Takitumu chiefs say that Tangiia never offered the au to Karika ; he offered him a companionship or #r?&amp;?-comradeship, that is to say, offered to make him equal in rank to himself. This, of course, the chiefs would not agree to, and Pou-te-aria, who was a high chief, seized the emblem, and in getting away to another part of the canoe with it, it fell into the sea ; hence this man received the new name of Au-topa (the fallen emblem of ariki-ship.) This man has descendants now living at Arorangi, Rarotonga. I have this family's version of story, which will be given when I send \n the full history of Tangiia-nui. 5. The Mataiapos, or chiefs, deny that any pare-kura was offered to Karika ; their ancestors would not allow this ; for at the time they stood equal to Karika ; he was conquered by their canoe, and had it not been for Karika handing over his daughter to Tangiia, Karika would have been killed, for after she had been given to Tangiia as his wife, Tangiia said to Karika, " I adopt you as a son ; I give unto you a mother which is the backbone of my canoe, i.e., the chiefs and warriors on the canoe." Thus Tangiia secured safety for Karika, for he wanted the latter as an ally in the forthcoming struggle with Tutapu. 6. Karika resented the action of the mataiapos, or chiefs, in their scant respect shown to him, and he, therefore, gave Tangiia wrong directions as to the course to steer, as he desired that Tangiia and his followers should perish. They also tell me that the Tai-rua-koko was a great whirlpool in the ocean where the waves rose mountains high?many miles to the south of Rarotonga. 7. Te-ava-rau: The name given by Tangiia to the entrance at Nga-Tangiia, which means, " The-two-hundred-harbours " ; the name was given by Tangiia from the fact that he called and entered into two hundred harbours in his flight from Tutapu-aru-roa. 8. Ve and Tautenga: These two were relatives of Tangiia's, and as soon as Tutapu landed at Nga-Tangiia they hurried on over the reef to Avarua, for they knew that Tangiia was there, and warned him that Tutapu had arrived, and advised him what to do. The writer does not state that these two men stole</page><page sequence="21">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 209 Tutapu's canoe whilst the battle was in progress, and sailed out to sea with it. They knew that reinforcements were coming from Iva to assist Tutapu, and they sailed out on the track by which the Iva canoes would come so as to intercept them and so tell them that Tutapu was killed (they knew he would be killed) with all his followers, and they alone were the survivors and had escaped with the canoe. In order to give colour to their story they cut and stabbed one another with their spears, they stood up in the canoe in doing this ; soon they had made many wounds on one another, and thus when they fell in with the Iva fleet they stopped them and called out, " Tupapa ua nei?Heng a ma Tau-teng a, kar e e marikong a te taua a Tutapu, kua eke te tamaki, ko maua ua nei e ora nei" Which translated is, " We stand alone before you?Uenga and Tau-tenga, the cause of Tutapu was useless, t'is overthrown, the host is routed?and we alone survive to tell the tale." This story of the battle between Tangiia and Tutapu is a very, very, small portion of the full narrative, which 1 hope to shortly translate, which gives the names of all the warriors of any note who were of Tutapu's party and were killed. 9. The mataiapos do not agree with the writer that Karika took part in the fight, they state that all he did was to guard the shore, following up the fight as it progressed forward inland, killing any of Tutapu's party who tried to escape by way of the beach, and guarding the roads so that none of the enemy could get to the rear and attack Tangiia from behind. 10. This story does not agree with many others for they say that Tutapu was wounded between the big and second toe, that Tangiia and Tutapu were engaged in single combat at the time that this happened. 11. The allusion to Kaukura here seems out of place in the way it is put, for Kaukura was already at Rarotonga ; in fact he came here before Tangiia with Iro-nui-ma-oata. Iro had picked him up at Takutea Island, and at his request brought him on to Rarotonga. Tutapu visited Rarotonga shortly after, and he and Iro departed to Tahiti where Iro met his relative Tangiia-nui, and lived at Tahiti for some time as the guest of Tangiia. It was at this time that Iro's son Ta-i-te-ariki was born, and was adopted by Tangiia and called Pa-te-ariki-upoko tini. For when Tangiia made his tour round the island he came across the tribe of Kaukura who joined him, for they were part of his own people who had arrived on the island previous to Tangiia. Again Kaukura was a,n ancestor of Tangiia's, and had been deified by the Kaukura tribe, thus :? Kaukura Amaru-ariki Amaru -enua Kaungaki-ariki-ki-te-maramarz:Te Tupa-ki-Avaiki Tangiia-nui 12. Pu-kuru-vaa-nui : This was the principal Koutu-ariki of Takitumu, in the same manner as Arai-te-tonga was the principal Koutu-ariki of Avarua. This was the first Koutu-ariki made by Tangiia, and within the limits of this koutu he built the marae Paeta. This was where he created Ta-i-te-ariki as an ariki over Takitumu, and it was even a greater place than Arai-te-tonga, for it was at this koutu ihat all Takitumu met when great events were to be discussed. This koutu was named after the cause of the dispute between Tangiia and Tutapu :?Pu-kuru (bread fruit-tree), vaa-nui (great mouth) which meant the great and many words of anger he had with Tutapu over the division of this tree.

Now mana means power, prestige, super-human power, hut we fail to see that either meaning meets the case here. The story hears on the persistence of Ak? in his love making, and also on his humorous intercourse with T?ne ; but whether this is the god Tane or a man's name is uncertain, for Polynesian gods are very anthropomorphic. It is the most humorous story we have seen from Rarotonga ; and one can well understand the appreciation of the listeners as some old fellow would tell the story with that expressive gesticulation that adds so much to a narrative, and which is so characteristic of the Polynesian. Unfortunately the narrative is unfinished. Mr. Savage has kindly looked through the story and made some corrections.] AKO-AKATURI-ROA sought some means by which he might secure the affections of the lady Miritau-akana, and this is the course he took : He proceeded to cook some food for the lady, and when it was nicely done he addressed his grandparents, saying, " O the grandparents ! Go ! Take this food to our lady." So the grand parents went off, and on their arrival at a certain place they set down their burden and proceeded to eat the choicest morsels, leaving the inferior parts, which they took on with them. When they reached the home of the lady, she asked, " Who is this food from ? " The two old people replied, " From your (would-be) husband ! From Ak?." Then said that lady, "Alas, indeed ! Who would fetch the food of that pig ?" She then took the food and cast it before the pigs to eat. Ak?'s grandparents then returned to the home, where they found Ak? awaiting their arrival. He said to them, " 0, the elders ! Where is the abiding place of our lady ? " They said to Ak?, " When we got there the lady asked, ' Whose food is this ? ' We replied, ' It is from your husband; from Ak?.' At this she seized the food and ate it."</page><page sequence="25">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt GUI's Papers. 213 Ak? was delighted at this, and then said to his elders, " There are still some morsels of food left." So other parcels of food were made up (and sent to the lady) ; and so it went on until all the food in the house had been consumed, as well as (other presents, even) the pillar and side posts of the house, until nothing but the bare ground was left, and no further means (of propitiating the lady) remained. After the lapse of some time, Ak? asked the elders, " 0, the grand parents ! What other food remains in our home ? " They replied, " There is still the fish ! " Again Ak? asked, " Where ? " The answer was, "In the sea." Ak? then said, "What is the sign (means to obtain it) ? " They replied, " You must paddle out to sea, and when you see many birds (hovering over the water), that is the place ; they are below." The next morning Ak? took his paddle, basket, lines, and hook, and went down to the seashore, where he launched his canoe and paddled out to sea, where he saw the flock of birds, and there he let down his lines ; the fish took the bait, and he continued to fish until the canoe was full. Then he returned and carried up his fish to his home ; here he wrapped them up, and then said to the old people, " Go, and take to our lady the fish ! " So the old people went off on their errand, and at a certain plac? set down their burden and feasted on the best of the fish, taking on with them the inferior ones. When they got to the home of the lady Miritau-akana, she asked, " Erom whom are those fish ? " They replied, " From your lover, from Ak? ! " The lady then said, "Alas I Who would go to the trouble of fetching the fish of that pig ? " Then were those same fish cast before the pigs to be eaten. When the old people reached home they found Ak? waiting the result, who asked, " 0, old people ! Where are the fish of our lady ? " They replied, " When we got there she rushed at the fish and ate them." Ak? was very pleased, and said, " There are still some fish remaining ; take some more as before (to the lady)." And so it went on for several days. Some time after this, Ak? again went out to sea to fish ; but he was blown away to the distant land of Tane, where he was driven ashore in the night. He hauled up his canoe into the forest, and stayed there. Then he shouted, " Who is the arila inland who owns this passage (in the reef) on the shore ? Shout your reply that I may hear ! " This aroused Tane, and he called out, " Tu-te-maeva ahoy ! Who is this ariki at the shore (working) at my canoe-passage ? " The parents replied, " Go to sleep, 0, my chief ! it is only a night vision." And this went on until daylight. When morning came, Tane proceeded to the shore to see who the new comer was, and when he reached the passage he beheld another, a different one to his own. Then he said, " There was only one passage</page><page sequence="26">214 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY (before) ; whose can the second be ? " He then proceeded to search, and there he found Ak? in the forest. Tane called out, "Alas! what a demon!" Ak5 answering him replied, "If thou art a demon, so am I ! If thou art a man, so am I ! If thou art a chief, so am I ! If a god, I am one also ! If thou art great, so am I ! Thou art of the land and an owner who lives there ; I am a stranger and may err ; I landed near here on your shore ! " Then Tane took him and led him to his home, and split out some firewood to cook food to feed Ak? with. Ak5 then asked Tane, " Do you cook the food in your land ? " Tane said " Yes ! " Then said Ak5, " We don't cook food at my home?it is already cooked ; the sun cooks it for me ! "* This was the first word (thorn) into T?ne's heart. When the food was cooking, Tane said to his men they must go and fish. Ak? (hearing this) asked, " Do you catch the fish in your country ? " Tane replied, " Yes !" To which Ak? said, " We don't catch the fish in my country ?they come to my doorstep ; all we do is to clean them, and the fish are left to kick and wriggle about." This was the second word (thorn) into the heart of Tane (second slight). After the oven of food had been eaten, they rested. When evening came Tane said, " Light up the kukuif as a lamp." Ak5 asked, " Do you use tuitui for a light in your house ?" " Yes ! " said Tane. Then said Ak?, " My house is not lighted up with tuitui?the sun is on one side, the moon on the other, and thus there is light until daylight ! " This was the third word (thorn) into T?ne's heart (third slight or insult). So they remained there together for some time, until Ak5 began to be restless and much regretted his own home. Feeling this, Ak5 proposed they should go thither, which was consented to by Tane. They went away together in one canoe, and when they got out to sea that chief sat down and did compose his lament. Now ascends, ascends, Tu-tamaeva O ! To the Nu-roa-i-o-ItiJ And our son is Au. Then the chief composes another tangi :? Ascends, ascends, Tu-tamaeva To the cocunut-at-Tarikura I have the courageous heart The son of us two.

" Tane replied, " Yes !" (This story ends abruptly here.) Note.?This Ak? was a member of the Pa family, a descendant of Tai-te-ariki. ?S. Savage. No. 16.

The reason why he went there was, that he was driven away from here through a feud that existed between him and Vakapora-Ta?i ; he was a younger brother to Vakapora, and he and his Matos (relations, followers) had charge of the land Makatea. The name of his Marae was " Te Ara-ka-nii." The cause that led up to the dispute was the tribute he had to render to Vakapora; he refused to perform the obligation when called upon, he withheld it as he was a rangatira, and refused to acknowledge the right of his elder brother to demand tribute from him. Vakapora sent repeated demands for the tribute but failed</page><page sequence="29">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 217 to exact it. This went on for some time, at last Tangi-tanra made war, and seized upon the family lands of Vakapora named Puanono and part of the swamp land in Karekare.

The names of Tangi-taura's warriors were Kuri-ava and Ngati-ava. Vakapora and his warriors and their fighters fought Tangi-taura and his two warriors and their men, with the result that Tangi-taura was beaten, and his two warriors Kuri-ava and Ngati-ava were slain with all their followers (Tangi-taura and his own men were spared). The names of Vakapora's warriors were Ariki-po, Aitu-pao and Rangi-onu, they and their followers killed the two opposing warriors with their followers. Here is the song com memorating the event :? The fight raged and was won at Makatea? Be thou a warrior strong to kill Tangi-taura Thou will have to fight fiercely for thy land? My land thou would'st despoil me of. The battle was fought and won?at Makatea? Won back my supremacy at Makatea. The warriors Kuri-ava and Ngati-ava? Were shamed and overthrown by Aitu-pao. Be strong?leap lightly O Ariki-po ! Oh warrior brave?overcome and slay Tangi-taura. Vakapora thus got possession of the houtu (see note) and the lands formerly held by Tangi-taura, and drove Tangi-taura and his Matos (immediate followers) ofi\ Tangi-taura built a canoe and called it " Te Ara-ka-nii," and he and his followers sailed away to sea. He intended going to Kuporu (Up?lu, in Samoa) the land of his ancestor Tuiti-ariki. But they were blown out of their course by the wind to another island, the name of which island was Te Rae-o-te-pau. He and his crew landed, and he called that island Taurutu (now known as Rurutu), he called it Taurutu?that was one of the Vakapora family lands at Rarotonga. Tangi-taura lived on that island, and a son was born to him there ; he called that son Marava?named him after his younger brother Akarava. The younger brother Akarava returned to Rarotonga and dwelt with Kaitua, and he told the news of their having reached an island named Te Rae-o-te-pau. When Akatauira (otherwise Te Ariki-tara-are) learnt of the vessel in which Akarava and his many men came in, he (Akatauira) stole it, and with his people sailed away to Enua-manu, that is to say Atiu, and remained there. He there begat the line of gam aru-Ariki, it is from him the tribe of Ngati-Te-Akatau-ira receive their name.</page><page sequence="30">218 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY NOTES. Eoutu.?A koutu is what would be called the Court of Royalty, it comes before a marae ; for in calling out the title of an ariki, or of a high chief such as a matai - apo, the name of such ariki would be called out by the public speaker, then his koutu would be named, and then the marae. The ariki being the head of the Court, and each member of the ariki family had the royal right of proclaiming themselves " a white pebble " of that koutu?&amp; proof of their royal rank ; each son or brother or daughter of the ariki can, as rangatiras, call themselves kirikiri-tea tea, white pebbles, or stone of so-and-so koutu (name). Maraes were built within the limits of a koutu as a rule ; sometimes one koutu contained three to four maraes. A koutu was a place where all the chiefs or priests met to discuss any tribal event of note ; certain stones were set up as seats, called akinanga, on which the chiefs sat during the discussion ; only the head of each family could take a seat on these stones in an ariki1 s koutu?that is to say the head of each mataiapo or rangatira family. Other arikis of other districts had also special seats ; in Takitumu, Pa Ariki would take the chief seat as supreme ariki, and Kainuku next, Tinomana next, and Makea next. Pukuru-vaa-nui is the name of Pa-Ariki's koutu. It is my intention to send in a paper on this subject, as there seems to be some doubt and misunderstanding as to the difference between a koutu and a marae. In this instance Tangi-taura held this koutu as a member of the mataiapo family Vakapora, subject to the jurisdiction of the chief (his elder brother) or mataiapo Vakapora. Tangi-taura could have his own marae, but not a koutu ; that alone was the right of the elder, no one of a lesser rank than a mataiapo had the right to hold a koutu. Kiato.?Kiatos were generally the descendants of the younger branches of the family ; they had a certain status in the tribe. Tutti Ariki.?This man is the ancestor of Vakapora ; he came to Rarotonga with Tangiia-nui from Tahiti. He came from Kuporu (Up?lu) originally, and with his brother Te-Ariki-Nuku-a-ki-roto left Karika's canoe, and joined Tangiia at Makatea, an island in the Paumotu Group. S. Savage. I find from the " Rarotonga MSS." Vol. I., p. 55, (Te Ariki-tare-are's version) that Kaitua mentioned in the foregoing narrative was the elder brother of Akarava (also mentioned above), both belonging to the Vakapora family. These two flourished about 20 generations ago, or say, about the year 1400, and this gives us a rough idea of when the island of Rurutu received its second name.? Editoe. ANCIENT BELIEF OF THE RUBUTU PEOPLE. Among Dr. Wyatt Grill's papers is the following note in the Barotongan dialect describing a very peculiar belief of the Burutu Islanders :? u About man when the body dies: The'Vaerua kino,' great evil spirit, comes and swallows the dead man's spirit into his belly. After a certain time the evil spirit evacuates the spirit. He (the evil spirit) then scrapes the inside of a coco-nut, and on completion he crushed the coco-nut in a h?mete, or bowl, and into this he placed the human spirit, and then stirred it about. This causes the spirit to become a 'Vaerua rikiriki ' (little spirit) also an evil spirit, to work for the great evil spirit, and to be at his command to be sent here and there. Such was the belief of the heathens of Burutu."</page><page sequence="31">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 219 No. 17. KO TE TERE MAI A AREKEA MEI UEA MAL Na Itio i tata.

THIS is a word about a certain man named Arekea, in the times of Are-ariki, ariki of Rarotonga; his wife was Takareu?that was the period he came to Rarotonga.</page><page sequence="32">220 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Arekea abandoned his home at Uea Island, and his arilci named Te Pou-o-te-rangi (lived 30 generations back from the year 1900?see table at end of " Hawaiki ") who was the ariki of Uea. His son's name was Te Pou-o-rongo, and his sister was Te Maora-o-Avaiki. That was the period that Arekea came to Raro tonga. The profession of that man was a recitor of karakias (incantations, invocations, &amp;c.?a priest), just like you (Dr. Gill), and taught the same kinds of things, prayers, &amp;c, you will be able to understand the meaning of that word. That man came to Rarotonga, abandoning his own island of Uea. Atupa was the district, and Puna-o-Arekea his home, at Avatiu was his marae named Paepae-tua-iva (at Rarotonga). The following were the priests in those days at Uea : Renga-ariki, Taai, and Arekea was the third. Messengers were sent to fetch Are kea, as the pure (prayers) were about to be said at the marae at Uea ; but Arekea did not respond. Another name for Uea was Varekao, the latter being its ' spirit ' name, Uea was the ' bodily' name. The names of the messengers who were sent were Maunga-piko, Kopu-ioi, Iku veru, Te Aputa-rangi, and Koura. But Arekea would not stir. Te Pou-o-te-rangi was very angry at this ; and then sent his son Ea? the ancestor of Karika, Katu, Takua, Maoke, Mara and Aroa (Raro tongan families). Those who fetched the canoe were Muu-tonga, or Motea, Muu tokerau, or Akatorau, Kona, Te Avaro, Te Ariki-karo-matangi, or Ria, Tuar?, Parapu, Rutunga and Tapuoti, and the canoe, and Tangiia [sic]. There is not a great deal of interest in this story, except as showing that the ancestors of the Makea family once dwelt at Uea, or. Wallis Island, some 180 miles west of Samoa, and also as showing the extent of the voyages undertaken by the old Polynesians. The story does not say so, but the probability is that Arekea was expelled from Uea for neglect of his duties. The chief Ea, mentioned, was the father of Karika who came and settled in Rarotonga, circa, a.D. 1250, at the same time as Tangiia. In Dr. Wyatt Gill's papers is to be found the genealogical table of the Makea family, which, however, makes Karika, mentioned above, to have flourished twenty-three generations, instead of the mean of twenty-six, from the year 1900. These kind of tables have not much interest for the general reader, but they are the only means we have of building up the chronology of the Polynesians, and will yet be of the greatest use to the future historian of the race. The names of those who ' fetched the canoe,' above, leave rather the impression that they are emblematical names for the winds, &amp;c.</page><page sequence="33">Extracts from Dr. Wyatt Gill's Papers. 221 This is the pedigree :? 36 35 30 27 25 23 20 15 10 Te Atu-te-pu Tiki Tauira-ariki-te-ai-po : 1 Tauira-ariki-te-?i-ao 2 Kakao-rere Kakao - tua - rengarenga Kakao-ngongo Makea Vai-o-uri = _l__ 1 Vai-o-tea 1 Te Neke-enua 1 Puta-ki-te-tai Tama-pure-tu Makea-peau - rango I Makea-tara-tu Makea -memeru I Makea-te-uru-pu Makea-tumu-pu Makea - vaero-rangi Makea-te-t?iti Mal ea-te-potiki Makea-teina Makea-turuia Makea-te-taiki Makea-rangi Te Pou-o-te-rangi I 2 Tuke-vae I Tuke-mata = Tavake-ariki Te Neke-o-te-rangi Ea Mokoroa-ki-aitu == Tangiia-nui</page><page sequence="34">222 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. Makea - te - pa tua - kino I Makea-uri 5 Makea-maiti Makea-pori Makea Daniela (died in 1910, aged about 65 or 60). It has always been held by the Rarotongans that the chief Karika, mentioned in the above story, came from Manu'a Island of the Samoa Group, to Rarotonga. Dr. Wyatt Gill wrote to Taunga, one of the Rarotongan Missionaries at Manu'a Island, asking him to make enquiries ; and on the 29th August, 1870, Taunga replies in an interesting, well expressed letter, giving the confirmation of the Rarotongan tradition from the Manu'a learned men. Taunga had been twelve years at Manu'a, he states, at that time, and consequently was well acquainted with the Samoan language. We take the following from Taunga's letter quoted above :? " E ko Makea-Karika taau i tata mai; teia te tupuanga o taua Makea-Karika, tei te enua taku e noo nei, koia oki ko Manu'a, i tua tuaia ra e ko Manuka. E tuatuaia e to Manu'a e, ko 'Ari'a.

E ko 'Ari'a tuakana, koia oki a Makea-Karika. E maata rai oki te tuatua i taua mea ra. E kua ui mai koe e, ' Kua kite ainei koe i a Rongo ? te atua i aka mori ei to Mangaia i muatangana ?

" As to the Makea-Karika that you wrote about ; this is the place where he originated from, from the island where I dwell, that is Manu'a, which is said to be Manuka (of Rarotongan tradition). The Manu'a people call him ' Ari'a,* and the place where he dwelt is called Aua-luma, where was his marae named ' Malae-tele.' Tangaroa was his god ; the place where his canoe was dubbed out is named Tafaga tafaga, which was the place from which he departed. The reason of his leaving was this : There was war between 'Ari'a (Karika) and another 'Ari'a, due to a struggle for the chieftainship. There were only a few people supporting the elder cousin (Karika) while the younger one had many people ; about three years were occupied in this struggle, when the elder cousin had to leave, and the island became subject to the younger, that is to Tui-Manu'a (King of Manu'a). 'Ari'a the elder was Makea-Karika. There is a great deal about this affair (in the Manu'a traditions). " You also ask me, ' Have you learnt anything about Rongo ? the god whom the Mangaians formerly worshipped ? ' I reply to you, Rongo was a child of Tangaroa, one of the Manu'a gods ; as the Manu'a people say, ' Rongo was a child of Tangaroa, and a god of Manu'a.' There were two of that name, Rongo and Turi?the sons of Tangaroa, both gods of Manu'a. And Rongona (Lologa) both sons of Tangaroa, and both high-chiefs, born of the woman Sina. Sina is called Ina in Rarotonga. Those people were all high chiefs of Manu'a, and Rongona was father of 'Ari'a the elder, whilst Le Lologa was father of 'Ali'a the younger. 'Ari'a the elder was Makea-Karika, and 'Ari'a the younger became Tui-Manu'a." (The descent from the above Tui-Manu'a to the middle of the nineteenth century will be found in " Reports of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science." By Dr. Fraser.) * The Samoans do not pronounce the * k,' but substitute the ' catch ' repre sented by an inverted comma. (Jo be continued.)</page></plain_text>
