B. Waywell many years ago. It crystallized during the period when the vast photographic collection of the late Professor Bernard Ashmole was being archived at King's College London. The collection consists of over ten thousand photographs of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures, many taken by Ashmole himself. Under Professor Waywell's supervision, the photos of the Ashmole Archive were identified and organized when I was employed as research assistant to work in the Archive from 1987-1991. Information concerning the dimensions, material and history of each piece of sculpture was amassed, bibliographies were compiled, and a useful sculpture library was created. It was in order to harness the potential of the Ashmole Archive as a research tool that the Pheidias project was originally undertaken. With the help of a major grant from the Leverhulme Trust, Professor Waywell brought together a team of researchers from 1991 to 1994, to study Pheidias, with the added aim of creating a computer database capable of storing all the available information, both written and photographic. I was responsible for research into the ancient sources and also studied sculpture types, along with Dr Birte Lundgreen, who started work on catalogues and bibliographies. By 1994, work on the sources was almost complete, and a large corpus of information had been gathered concerning sculpture types. Much further effort, however, was still needed to complete the project, and it was decided that the research should be published in traditional book form. I therefore undertook the task of revising the existing material, completing the research, as well as adding sections on the life of Pheidias and the sculptures of the Parthenon, and producing all the necessary ancillary documents. Part I consists of essays on works associated with Pheidias. These works fall into two main groups: named works attributed to Pheidias in the written sources and sculpture types known from Roman copies which are traditionally thought to be in the style of Pheidias. In the first group are the Amazon at Ephesos, the Anadoumenos, the Aphrodite Ourania, the Athena Areia, the Athena Lemnia, the Athena Parthenos, the Athena of Pellene, the Athena Promachos, Eros, the Marathon Monument, and the Zeus at Olympia. For these works, the starting point is the literary evidence, which has been carefully combed for information concerning the statues in question. Then follows a review of attributions of preserved statue types. In some cases, the attributions are very tentative and even doubtful, since so little is known about the lost masterpiece. In other cases, where the iconography is at least partially known, as, for example, with the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia, a more detailed reconstruction of the composition is considered and other aspects of interest are discussed too. In the second group, the following sculpture types are discussed: the Copenhagen Anakreon, the Apollo Kassel, the Apollo Tiber, the Athena Hope/Farnese, the Athena Medici, the Hermes Ludovisi, the Olympias/Sappho type, the Riace bronzes, and the Dresden Zeus. In these chapters, the first section examines the type as it is handed down in the various Roman copies, while the second section considers whether the type fits with any description in the written sources. The attribution to Pheidias of some of these statue types is doubted by the present author, but they are included for discussion because of their frequent appearance in handbooks in connection with Pheidias. The Medusa Rondanini is discussed in the appendix as it is definitely rejected as a work of Pheidias. Not all works xxi</page><page sequence="19">xxii LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS attributed to Pheidias in the sources are given a separate chapter, either because there is insufficient information about them or because the correctness of the attribution is doubted. These works are mentioned in the final section of Part III, The Life of Pheidias, as well as being discussed under the relevant sources in Volume 2. At the end of each chapter comes a catalogue of sculptures, a list of relevant sources and a specialized bibliography. Part II concentrates on the Parthenon, and the involvement of Pheidias in the creation of the temple sculptures. In an attempt to consider the question from a stylistic point of view, since the literary sources are so unforthcoming on this point, it was thought appropriate to compare the sculptures with perhaps the best known of the works of Pheidias, namely the shield of the Athena Parthenos. Where so much is lost, it is fortunate that the shield is comparatively well known. With its wealth of different figures, the shield provides a good deal of information concerning Pheidian figure types and poses, drapery, the use of landscape elements and composition. The date of the shield and the use of relief suggest comparison with the metopes and frieze. For this reason, the character of the relief carvings of the temple is looked at afresh. The pediments are only briefly mentioned, and they are considered primarily from the compositional angle on the grounds that Pheidias would have had more to do with their design than their execution. In Part III a synthesis is made of all that can be gleaned from the sources concerning the life, the achievements and the reputation of Pheidias. The broad lines of his life are summarized, and the sources dealing with his supposed trial are examined. The works which can be attributed to Pheidias are briefly discussed, to assess the development of the career of Pheidias in the use of different techniques and compositions. Works which are thought not to be by Pheidias are also discussed briefly. Towards the end of this part, all the sources connected with Pheidias are listed according to subject, with the aim of providing an easy cross-reference to Volume 2. Volume 2 gathers the written evidence for the life and works of Pheidias. Alongside a large, but not uncontroversial, body of Greek and Roman sculptures, the written sources, both literary and epigraphical, provide material evidence of primary importance, which help one to discover something of the contribution made to western art by a man whose works have almost entirely vanished. The intention has been to include as many of the relevant sources as possible, to make the material accessible to English speaking students by providing translations of the texts throughout, and to re-evaluate the available evidence as thoroughly as possible in order to judge the strengths and weaknesses of accepted or traditional views concerning the work of Pheidias. When there is so little to go on, and so much room for speculation, the sources have to be taken in and for themselves in order to assess their worth properly. Too often they have been used to say more than they do, or they have been taken out of context and misunderstood. By setting the passages in context, both in terms of the date of a piece and the subject being treated when an allusion is made, it is hoped that a clearer picture can be formed of the significance of any source. The written sources fall into two groups, the literary and the epigraphical. For ease of reference, the literary sources are arranged alphabetically in two separate parts, with those written in Greek preceding those written in Latin. The literary sources date from the later 5th Century BC to the end of the Byzantine period. There are a little over three hundred and seventy Greek sources and almost a hundred Latin sources. The Greek and Latin authors may give information of a historical, biographical, descriptive, or art historical nature. They</page><page sequence="20">PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS xxiii may record anecdotes about artists or provide references to a work of art which help reconstruct the object's appearance or history. The sources vary greatly in their reliability and usefulness, and the commentary attempts an evaluation of the author's statements that takes into account the period in which he was writing as well as the context in which he included the reference under examination. The epigraphical sources are predominantly in Greek, though there are some in Latin. They are very matter-of-fact, coming as they do mainly from building accounts, treasury accounts or statue bases. For the literary sources the information is organized as follows. First, the name of the author, the title of the work and the exact reference for the passage in question are given. The letter O, followed by a number, gives the Overbeck reference, where this exists. Then follows the text, the translation into English and a reference indicating which edition of the text has been used. The translation is always mine. Where possible, a reliable and easily available edition of each text has been used, one which provides a good apparatus criticus to which the reader can refer if necessary. Then follows an indication of the date when the passage was written and, if appropriate, the context. In order to avoid repetition, further information, concerning the author and the work from which the piece is taken, is gathered towards the end of the volume in the section entitled The Authors and their Works. The notes which follow comment on any points of interest concerning Pheidias and his works that occur in the passage. When several passages deal with the same subject, one key passage provides the amplest notes while the other passages all refer the reader to this and other related passages. Since this volume is intended to be read in conjunction with Volume 1, in which essays on the life and works of Pheidias are gathered, the discussions on subjects covered in the first volume are not intended to give much detail. In particular, there is little discussion of statue types and, for subjects such as these as well as, for example, the reconstruction of named works, the reader is referred to the relevant part of the first volume. A fairly similar arrangement is maintained for the inscriptions, though here a short bibliography is included within each section too. A unified discussion of the sources which deal with a work attributed to Pheidias, as well as those which touch upon his life, can be found in the relevant section in each chapter of Volume 1, where the available written evidence for each subject is reviewed. In an attempt to be as complete as possible, several methods were used to collect the relevant sources. Initially, computer searches were undertaken, with the generous help of the staff at the Computing Centre of Oxford University, of collections of material held on CD-Rom. The TLG, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae , comprises a large proportion of Greek texts up to the 6th century AD. PHI (Packard Humanities Institute) Latin Authors is a slightly less complete collection of Latin texts up to about the 4th century AD, while PHI Greek inscriptions contains many of the important Greek inscriptions. These collections were scanned for the name Pheidias, as well as Athena Parthenos, Athena Promachos and other key names. In many cases the particular manuscript reading thus obtained was not the version eventually chosen, where more reliable or more up to date readings were available. Nevertheless, the effort saved in gathering the texts using these computer searches and in simply emending texts rather than having to type them in from scratch was great. Once an initial list had been gathered, with the help of the TLG and PHI collections, it was then important to supplement this list both by searching through important authors not included in those collections and by examining the modern literature for further references</page><page sequence="21">xxiv LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS for each subject. As mentioned above, TLG goes up to the 6th century AD, while PHI Latin authors does not include such 4th and 5th century AD writers as Ammianus Marcellinus, Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris, all of whom have yielded some references to Pheidias and his works. In the standard modern literature for the subject, the principal work remains Overbeck' s Die antiken Schriftquellen zur Geschichte der bildenden Künste bei den Griechen (1868), the most complete and the most far-ranging work of its type, which includes texts and a few comments arranged by subject. Other important works referred to include Stuart- Jones' Select Passages from Ancient Writers , Illustrative of the History of Greek Sculpture (1895), Jahn and Michaelis' Arx Athenarum (1901), which deals with the monuments seen by Pausanias on the Athenian Akropolis, Donnay's doctoral thesis, Phidias dans la tradition écrite (1963), Pollitt's Sources and Documents. The Art of Greece (1978), and Stewart's section on sources in Greek Sculpture (1990). Stuart Jones, Pollitt and Stewart do not aim at completeness. Jahn and Michaelis, whose range is limited to works on the Athenian Akropolis, group references usefully according to subject, but they rarely provide a text. Overbeck provides no translations. His comments are limited and, despite the enormous number of sources he includes, there are some lacunae. Kallimachos, for instance, and Niketas Choniates, are both missing. In addition, Overbeck does not deal with the inscriptions. Donnay's thesis likewise does not include all the inscriptions. This book has been a long time in the writing and it would never have been completed without the generous help of a number of people. Professor Waywell's enthusiasm for the subject, his willingness to share ideas and to devote time to the reading and rereading of the text have always been a great encouragement, and I am profoundly grateful to have worked with him. The first part of the chapter on the Apollo Kassel is written by Professor Waywell. The three years during which I collaborated with Birte Lundgreen were very interesting and fruitful, and I am grateful for all the useful discussions we had during this period, many of which contributed to the essays on types. Dr Lundgreen provided the basis for several of the catalogues of objects and worked in particular on the Athena Medici type. I would also like to acknowledge grateful thanks to the staff of the Computing Centre at Oxford University, who helped me access the TLG and PHI collections; to the staff of the Humanities Computing Centre, King's College London, for their general support; to Karim Arafat who read through the manuscript and made some very helpful suggestions; to the late John Barron, Antonio Corso, Barry Hall, Robert Ireland, V.

Finally, and most deeply, I would like to thank my husband, Anthony Davison, who has always encouraged and supported me. Not only did he spend hours caring for our children when they were younger so that I could study, but he has also given much useful assistance on matters relating to the word processing of the text.</page><page sequence="22">PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS xxv Details of the sources for the illustrations can be found in Volume 3.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE In his dialogue, Imagines , Lucian pays an elaborate compliment to Panthea, the courtesan from Smyrna who was the favourite of the Emperor Lucius Verus, by praising her physical and mental qualities through comparison with masterpieces of the visual and the literary arts, thus flattering not only the woman and so, indirectly, the Emperor, but also the reader, who is cultured enough to appreciate the allusions that are being made. One of the works Lucian mentions is a beautiful statue of an Amazon leaning on her spear by Pheidias. The Amazon statue is praised particularly for its mouth and neck, which are regarded as models of feminine beauty. These, combined with the outline of the face of the much admired Athena Lemnia, as well as its cheeks and nose, would, according to Lucian, provide the ideal female face. Pliny records that Pheidias 's Amazon was made of bronze and that it was produced for a competition held at Ephesos.1 Several famous artists of the mid- fifth century BC took part in the competition. They each made statues of Amazons and when these were dedicated at the temple of Diana the artists were asked to judge which statue they considered the best. They all put their own work first, so the best was declared to be the one they had placed second, which was the statue by Polykleitos. Competitions amongst ancient artists seem to have been quite common. Pliny tells of a competition between Alkamenes and Agorakritos and Tzetzes describes one between Pheidias and Alkamenes.2 There is epigraphical evidence for the competition to make the akroteria for the temple of Zeus at Olympia. According to the inscription on the base of his famous Nike, Paionios of Mende was the victor.3 Nevertheless, the authenticity of Pliny's story is rightly called into question by the fact that it is not unique. According to Herodotus and Plutarch the same sort of thing happened for the allocation of the prize of valour after Salamis.4 Another difficulty with Pliny's account is that he lists five artists, of whom two, he says, were Kresilas and Kydon. Kydon is not attested elsewhere, whereas the ethnic of the Cretan artist Kresilas was KuScovicíttiç. It is, therefore, probable that Pliny has misinterpreted his source here - possibly Douris of Samos, author of a treatise, riepi £coypá(1&gt;ü)v - and that 1 Pliny, NH 34.53 and 34.54. 2 Pliny, NH 36.17; Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.333ff. 3 See Boardman (1985a) fig. 139. 4 Herodotus, VIII. 123, and Plutarch, Them. 17. 1</page><page sequence="24">2 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS four of the artists who produced Amazons for Ephesos were Polykleitos, Pheidias, Kresilas and Phradmon. Whether or not there really was a competition, with the participants and outcome Pliny describes, Pliny's account preserves the valuable information that four or five bronze statues of wounded Amazons were dedicated in the sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesos in the Classical period by leading artists of the day. Pliny, NH 34.54, specifically says that Pheidias 's Amazon was made of bronze, and this was no doubt true of those of the other participants too since Pliny discusses only bronze statues in this book and, moreover, it is probable that the Amazons stood together in a group. Several types of Amazon statues have survived, all fairly close in style, dress and size, and all deriving from bronze originals dating from after the mid-fifth century BC, perhaps the 430s BC. A date some time after the middle of the century for the production of the statues would not conflict with the available evidence concerning the dates of the artists in question. It is quite possible that Pheidias and Polykleitos came into contact, for they were certainly active at around the same time, even if Polykleitos was probably somewhat younger than Pheidias and outlived him by a good few years. Kresilas, although coming from Crete, seems to have worked mostly in Athens. He was active around 450-430 BC. Not much is known about the Argive sculptor Phradmon. Pliny places him in the 90th Olympiad, after Polykleitos, because of the participation of both these artists, according to Pliny, in the Ephesos competition.5 This may be correct, and such a date would fit in with Pausanias's attribution, in VI.8.1, of the statue of Amertes of Elis at Olympia to the same artist, if the victory of Amertes dates from after 448 BC. There is also evidence for a 4th century BC Phradmon, possibly a descendant of the late 5th century BC artist.6 Finally, the link with Ephesos is supported by the discovery made in the Roman theatre at Ephesos of a relief that copies one of the attested types of Amazon statues.7 The appropriateness of a dedication composed of statues of Amazons at the Artemision of Ephesos becomes evident when one recalls the Ephesian belief that Amazons found a safe haven in the sanctuary of Artemis when they were fleeing first from Dionysos and, later, from Herakles.8 The Amazons, wounded and exhausted, were given the right of asylum in the sanctuary. Thus the Classical monument symbolized the protective power of the Artemision, a privilege which remained the pride of Ephesos for centuries. The Amazons were highly revered, for they reminded the Ephesians that the holiness of their sanctuary had very ancient roots. Hölscher suggests that the Classical monument mentioned by Pliny may have been set up to mark the inauguration of the Artemision, which was started shortly after 560 BC and which, according to Pliny, took about 120 years to complete.9 He also suggests that the theme of the monument, and the decision to 5 Pliny, NH, 34.49. 6 See Anth. Pal. IX.743. 7 Vienna I 811; see Boardman (1985a) fig. 190b. ° Pausanias, VII.2.7. Pausanias records that the sanctuary was founded by two autochthonous heroes, Koresos and Ephesos, and was revered from early days as a place of refuge. He disputes Pindar's opinion, fragment 174, that the sanctuary was founded by the Amazons on their expedition against Theseus of Athens. 9 Hölscher (2000) 211-12; Pliny, NH, 36.95.</page><page sequence="25">AMAZON OF EPHESOS 3 attract some of the best contemporary artists to work on it, including Pheidias and Polykleitos, show the political dimension of the commission. In the mid-fifth century BC, Athens was collecting tribute from her allies and, in exchange, providing them with protection against their enemies. Athens was also becoming one of the most important centres for the arts and many artists were abandoning their native homes in order to work in Athens on the great building projects undertaken by Perikles. By commissioning leading artists to make the Amazon monument, Ephesos is seen by Hölscher as deliberately asserting itself and expressing its independence from Athens.10 1.2. ATTRIBUTIONS Three main types of wounded Amazon statues are generally believed to go back to originals from the later 5th century BC. All a little over life-size, they are known both from plaster cast fragments of the 1st century BC found at Baiae and from Roman marble copies. These are the so-called Sciarra, Mattei, and Sosikles types. Judging from the number of copies of these statues, they were clearly popular works and, considering how unusual the type would have been in the mid-fifth century BC, when female figures were seldom shown uncovered, it is possible that they do indeed reflect the Amazon statues about which Pliny writes in NH 34.53, the works of famous masters. The Sciarra Amazon type, also referred to as the Lansdowne type, is known in about thirty Roman copies and variants (Figs. 1.1-2). 11 The Amazon, wounded under the left breast, is shown leaning with her left forearm on a pillar, her right hand resting on the top of her head. She wears a short tunic, girdled at the waist, and both breasts are uncovered. The right leg is straight, the left set back, with the heel of the foot raised off the ground. The Doria-Pamphili statue, sometimes listed as a fourth type, is a variant of the Sciarra type, with both breasts covered. The Mattei type is known in at least eleven copies and variants (Figs. 1.3-6). 12 This figure has her weight on the right leg and the left is set slightly forward, with the heel of the foot raised just off the ground. She wears a short girdled tunic, with the left breast uncovered and, while her left arm is at her side, the right is raised over the head and the hand holds something. This is generally thought to be a spear, which the lowered left hand is steadying. The Amazon has a quiver on her left side, and probably a small bow too. The Sosikles type, also referred to as the Capitoline type, is known in at least forty- three Roman copies and variants (Fig. 1.7). 13 This figure too wears a short, girdled tunic, but this time the right breast is uncovered and a cloak is draped down the back and round the neck. The Amazon has her weight on the left leg, with the right leg set back and the heel of the right foot raised off the ground. The right arm is raised, revealing a wound beneath the right armpit. She probably held a spear. The design is unusual for the period in that the left forearm is brought in front of the torso in an almost Lysippan manner. 10 Hölscher (2000) 21 Iff. 11 Bol (1998) 171; 173-87. 12 Bol (1998) 172-73; 206-15. 13 Bol (1998) 171-72; 187-206.</page><page sequence="26">4 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Michaelis was the first to work on the Amazons and sort them into groups.14 Furtwängler attributed the Sciarra type to Polykleitos, the Sosikles to Kresilas and the Mattei to Pheidias, attributions which were to last for some years, though not without objection.15 In particular, scholars disagreed about the authors of the Sciarra and Sosikles types, which many believed should be Kresilas and Polykleitos respectively. This was the main point of disagreement till Weber's article in 1976 in which she attempted to attribute the Sciarra type to Polykleitos, the Sosikles to Pheidias and the Mattei to Kresilas.16 The evidence from the literary sources, as set out in section 1 , establishes one point at least. According to Lucian, Imagines 4-6, Pheidias 's Amazon was leaning on a spear. On this evidence it seems probable that Pheidias made either the Sosikles or the Mattei Amazon. Despite the disagreements over the attributions of the individual Amazon types to the various sculptors, there seems to be widespread agreement concerning the date of the three types, which is reckoned on stylistic grounds to be around 440-430 BC. During this period the three sculptors who are said to have created the types in question would have been at different stages in their artistic development: Pheidias was the oldest and most experienced, Polykleitos was in his prime, while Kresilas was the youngest and probably the least experienced. Divergent opinions on the date of creation of the types are to be found in Ridgway and Harrison.17 Ridgway believes that the Sosikles type alone goes back to a 5th century BC original; she regards the Mattei type as deriving from a later 4th century BC or early Hellenistic type, and the original of the Sciarra type as a Classicistic work. Harrison dates the Mattei Amazon in the early 4th century BC, relating it to the sculptor of the west pediment of the temple of Asklepios at Epidauros. Since Pheidias's Amazon was shown leaning on a spear, according to Lucian, and the Sciarra Amazon type leans on a pillar, it is probably correct not to associate the Sciarra type with Pheidias. And indeed the Sciarra type displays a distinctly Polykleitan pose. On these grounds it has been attributed to Polykleitos by many scholars, most convincingly by R. Bol, who considers the pose to be in the spirit of the contrapposto to the very last detail: the toes of the relaxed and backward placed left leg only just touch the ground; the arm on the side of the supporting right leg is relaxed, resting on the head; and the head is turned to the side of the supporting leg.18 A relief now in Vienna which was found in Ephesos, and which shows exactly this Amazon type, has been put forward by some as evidence in support of the attribution of the Sciarra type to Polykleitos (Fig. 1.1). 19 It is thought likely that the Amazon chosen for depiction in such a copy would be that of the winner of the competition, namely Polykleitos. But as doubt has been cast on the story of the competition and as other Amazon heads have been found in the same area, the 14 Michaelis (1886) 14-47. 15 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 128ff. 16 Weber (1976) 28-96. 17 Ridgway (1974) 1-17; Harrison (1982b) 53-88. 18 Bol (1990) 229; (1998) 73-87. Von Steuben (1993) 73-102 opposes this attribution. So too does Dohrn (1979) 112ff. 19 Vienna, I 811; Boardman (1985a) fig. 190b.</page><page sequence="27">AMAZON OF EPHESOS 5 importance of the Vienna relief as an indicator of the author of the original of the Sciarra Amazon type should not be exaggerated.20 Weber attempted to prove that the Amazon Mattei carried a large bow instead of leaning on a spear, as generally thought. This idea should be rejected for several reasons. A large bow is an improbable piece of equipment for a lightly armed Amazon. The Trier and Tivoli replicas indicate that the Mattei Amazon already carried a small bow below her quiver. It was held with the quiver by a strap running along the edge of the chiton across the breast. This strap is visible on various copies including the cast of the type from Baiae (Fig. 1.8). The remains of the hands (the right from the Tivoli and the left from the Capitoline replicas) indicate that she held a straight object, not one that was bent like a bow and, according to Dohrn, there is room for a spear along the left side of the statue.21 The addition of a long bow does not help explain the pose in the same way as the spear does: with a spear the Amazon can be seen to be about to vault on to a horse. Such an action is also indicated by her ankle-strap.22 Further evidence for the spear has been seen by Harrison in the hole on the left side of the Tivoli replica's base.23 The evidence from replicas of the type strongly indicates that the Mattei Amazon held a spear. On these grounds, therefore, either the Mattei or the Sosikles types could reflect the Pheidian Amazon, and views on this matter remain very divided. Basing her judgement on the arm of the statue in the Louvre, Weber reconstructed the Sosikles Amazon with the right arm held quite far from the body. This has rightly been challenged, as the gem of the same type in the Cabinet des Médailles shows the spear closer to the body so that the body does not lean on the spear but rather holds it, like the Doryphoros.24 Bothmer and Stewart are both of the opinion that, with the raised right shoulder on the opposite side to the raised left hip, the Sosikles type displays features of the Polykleitan canon and should be ascribed to Polykleitos.25 But Strocka rightly disputes this attribution, pointing to the turn of the head towards the relaxed leg and the crossing of the torso with the left arm, features which cannot be described as Polykleitan in nature.26 In agreement with Weber, Strocka maintains that the Sosikles type reflects the work of Pheidias.27 This type was the most often copied of all the Amazons, an indication that it was the work of a great master. The contrast between the fine folds of the chiton and the heavy folds of the cloak are reminiscent of the Athena Medici, which Strocka associates with Pheidias's great bronze Athena. The head is judged to be a larger and older-looking 20 A fragment of the head of a column-figure of the Sosikles type was found in the Ephesos area, along with the Milles head, which has been associated with both the Sciarra and the Mattei Amazons by different scholars. 21 Dohrn (1979) 112ff. 22 Bothmer (1957) 220. 23 Harrison (1982b) 72. 24 Dohrn (1979) 121. 25 Bothmer (1958) 216ff.; Stewart (1990) 162-63. 26 Strocka (2004) 224-25 and (2005) 138. 27 See Weber (1976) 28ff. and (1984) 93ff.</page><page sequence="28">6 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS version of the Bologna head, associated with the Athena Lemnia. Strocka also draws parallels between the Sosikles Amazon and the Amazons of the Athena Parthenos shield relief. The bare right breast, the body proportions and the dress are likened to those of the Amazon of the so-called death leap group, while the mantle finds a parallel in that of the dead Amazon shown with her head down. Bol, however, following the suggestion of Furtwängler, has attributed the Sosikles Amazon type to Kresilas.28 She regards the pose as a correction of the Polykleitan contrapposto, created after the Doryphoros and probably by a different artist. The unusual gesture of the left arm, which is drawn across the body bisecting the frontal viewpoint of the statue, is interpreted as designed to focus attention on the wound in her right side. This is the only Amazon who wears a cloak on her back, and her hair, with two Herakles knots behind, is much more decorative than that of the other types. These features may be indicative of a work created by a younger artist, and they make the association with Kresilas tempting.29 The Mattei Amazon type has been associated with Pheidias by a large number of scholars. The type has proved difficult to reconstruct, for the works based on it are relatively few in number, and they disagree with each other on several important points. Furthermore, most of them lack a head. In addition to the free-standing stone imitations of the type and the Baiae cast fragments, two controversial works which have to be considered in relation to the type are the 'Natter' gem (Fig. 1.6) and the Moni Loukou Karyatid (Fig. 1.9). The gem, which is now lost, is known through a drawing by Natter, a carnelian copy made by Natter, and three glass pastes, all dating from the 18th century. Furtwängler thought the gem was antique, because no other 18th century representations were known.30 He regarded it as the most reliable basis for the reconstruction of the original statue. Weber disagreed with this assessment. In her judgement, the gem was probably a creation by Natter.31 Platz-Horster, however, who has undertaken the fullest research on the gem and its later copies, insists that the gem was ancient.32 Bol accepts Platz-Horster' s arguments in favour of the gem, and makes full use of the gem in her reconstruction of the original statue type.33 The relation of the Moni Loukou Karyatid to the type is difficult to assess. Its purpose was quite different from that of the original free-standing Amazon statue and, perhaps partly for that reason, it deviates from the type in many respects. Nevertheless, the work may be valuable, as Bol suspects, in that it at least retains its head, unlike any of the other sculptural imitations of the type, and this may provide some clue about the original head type.34 28 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 128^1; Bol (1990) 213ff.; (1998) 87ff. 29 It should be noted that the evidence from Pliny that the Amazon of Kresilas was wounded i s not conclusive. See notes on Pliny, NH , 34.53. Both the Sosikles and the Sciarra types are portrayed as physically wounded. 30 Furtwängler (1900) III, 309. 31 See, for example, Weber (1990) 292-93. 32 Platz-Horster (1990) 58 Iff., no. 101. 33 Bol (1998) 65-66. 34 Bol (1998) 67-68.</page><page sequence="29">AMAZON OF EPHESOS 7 The drapery for the type is probably best reflected in the high quality replicas of the 1st century AD, the Capitolino and Vatican statues, as well as the fragmentary casts of the drapery from Baiae. These show the same rich arrangement, and they make an obvious comparison with the Parthenon sculptures, particularly those of the pediments. The folds of cloth are delicate and varied. A crinkly pattern of folds that can be seen most clearly over the right thigh, underlying the deeper catenary folds, emphasizes the lightness of the fabric. Other folds help to articulate the pose and the bodily forms, and there is evident enjoyment in the contrast drawn between the rich pattern of the folds and the bare flesh. The Antonine copies of the type are much less delicate. The folds are fewer in number, and the fabric appears heavier and less in harmony with the feminine forms beneath. In all cases, the Amazon wears a short tunic, belted at the waist and with a small overfall below. The chiton has come unfastened at the left shoulder, so that the cloth hangs down on this side, leaving the left breast uncovered. The skirt comes down to the knee on the right side but the cloth is then hitched up and tucked into the belt on the left side, so that much of the left thigh is exposed. This is a characteristic feature of the Mattei type, and it is found even on the glass pastes of the Natter gem, though not on Natter's drawing of the gem or the Moni Loukou Karyatid. Most of the copies agree that the right arm was raised above the figure's head, while the left was held down quite close to the body, steadying the spear. Natter's carnelian copy of the antique gem shows the right arm bent almost at right angles, but other copies indicate that the forearm was raised rather higher than this, perhaps as in the Tivoli statue (Fig. 1.4). This statue also shows that the fingers of the right hand were curled around the shaft of the spear, as in the Baiae cast fragment, with the back of the hand facing the spectator, just as it is depicted on the Tassie pastes and Natter's carnelian. The Vatican Mattei statue is the only free-standing statue which retains its antique plinth. From this work it appears that the Amazon stood with her weight on her right leg, the right foot set fully on the ground, and the left heel slightly raised but the foot not set back. The right leg is perpendicular to the base, and the figure's slight lean to the left is apparent only in the upper body and shoulders. Bol argues that this pose, which is repeated in the Capitolino statue and other stone copies, does not accurately reflect the original work, but was adopted by the marble sculptors for technical reasons, to make their statues more stable.35 The cast fragment from Baiae of the right foot shows that only the outside edge of the foot was set on the ground and bore the weight of the figure. This suggests that the much less stable pose shown on the Natter gem, where the Amazon steadied herself on her spear, is probably closer to the original. Here, the whole of the right side of the body, from the foot right up to the hand, is taut, while the left side is bowed and slack. As a result of the unsteadiness of the pose, the spear becomes an essential part of the composition. On the gem the head is also lightly turned to the left side. The remains of the neck of the Trier and Turin copies confirm that their heads too turned in this direction, unlike the restored heads of the Vatican, Capitolino and Petworth statues. The only replica which supports the view that the Mattei type was wounded is the replica from Tivoli, which has a wound on the left thigh with plastically rendered drops of blood gushing out from it (Fig. 1.4). 36 In agreement with several other scholars, Bol 35 Bol (1998) 58ff. 36 Tivoli, Hadrian's Villa, inv. 2266, cat. no. (1) 4.</page><page sequence="30">8 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS rejects the view that the wound belongs to the original statue and regards it as the creation of the copyist.37 As Bol demonstrates, the Tivoli statue varies from the type in several respects. True to type are the pondération, the left turn of the head, the arm positions and the quiver on the left side. But the legs are set further apart than on other copies, giving the figure a much more stable pose. The left arm is held further away from the body. The quiver is open and arrows can be seen inside it. There is no short bow beneath the quiver. Bol suggests that the type has been adapted to show a fighting Amazon. Hence the wound, the open quiver and the altered pose. It is significant that not only the Mattei Tivoli replica but also the Sciarra Tivoli replica, show divergences from other sculptures of the same types. The Sciarra Tivoli replica does not have a pillar to her left but rather a support to her right, and the left leg is positioned more to the side instead of being held straight back as on the other copies. As there is no pillar on the left side, the left arm is raised higher. Both Tivoli statues are thought to have been conceived as freestanding statues rather than as part of a monument. This probably explains the alterations made to their poses, intended to render them more viewable from all sides. The Amazon Mattei type is the only one of the three Amazon types shown carrying a quiver. Both the quiver and the nearby folds are depicted in very different ways on different replicas. The Turin copy had an attached quiver, which is now lost, and one can see that in this case the drapery folds were cut even in the place which would have been covered by the quiver. It has been suggested that because the quiver was difficult to cast it was left for the copyist to create.38 With the evidence from the Hermes Ludovisi petasos, Bol perhaps allows one to go a step further: the quiver could have been made of a different material from the rest of the statue, possibly copper, and removed when the statue was copied.39 The Mattei Amazon, unlike the other two Amazon types, lacks a secure head type. Arndt and Lippold maintained that the Petworth athlete with short hair and fillet belonged to the original statue of the Mattei Amazon type.40 This head is today believed to be of a young man, thought by some scholars to be by Pheidias. The Milles-Petworth head type, adjoined to the Petworth statue, which has a hairband and is turned lightly to the right, has been associated with the Mattei Amazon type by Weber, among others, but it is discounted by Bol, who regards it as a variant of the Sciarra Amazon head type.41 Most scholars doubt that the head of the Petworth Amazon statue belongs to the original. For one thing, the head is not made of the same material as the body.42 The evidence provided by the Natter gem, the Turin and Trier statues, and the Moni Loukou Karyatid, strongly supports the view that the original head type turned to the figure's left. Bol also rejects the Herculaneum-Tivoli head type, favoured by Becatti, on the grounds that it is another 37 Bol (1998) 63; Raeder (1983) 86-87; von Steuben, in Heibig IV (1972) no. 3200. 38 Weber (1976) 71. 39 Bol (1989) 223-27. 40 Arndt (1930) 1-4, pl. 1, and Lippold (1950) 171-72, pl. 61.2.

The quiver is included in the composition but, instead of hanging from the left side, it is shown in relief resting by the Amazon's right leg. The stance and the turn of the head to the left are correct, and the remains of the shoulders show that the right arm was raised, while the left was lowered, following the type. The face is very damaged and tells one little except that it was fairly wide with large features and a low forehead. More interesting perhaps, even if only partially visible given the format, is the hairstyle which differs from that of both the other Amazon types. Here, thickly undulating hair, which is parted in the middle, frames the forehead and temples and is brought towards the back of the head, half covering the ears. On the crown of the head the hair lies close to the skull, and behind the ears one can just see strands of hair rising up as if the hair was rolled up at the back. While admitting that there are few points of comparison between two such different objects, Bol very tentatively suggests that the Albani herm head shows some similarity to the Moni Loukou head, both in the arrangement of the hair and in its pose, which is lightly bent to the left (Fig. 1.10). This may suggest that the works share a common prototype. On the Albani head, however, the wavy crown of hair is much denser and more narrowly bound than in the case of the Moni Loukou head.44 1.3. CATALOGUE 1. AMAZON MATTEI STATUE Rome, Vatican Museum, 748. Statue. H. 2.11m; to right shoulder, 1.59m. Parian marble. Provenance unknown. Augustan. Parts which have been restored include the neck, both the arms, the lower half of the quiver, the right leg between the ankle and knee, the upper half of the tree-trunk, the pelta, the axe and the upper part of the helmet, as well as parts of the drapery. The left leg is broken but it is ancient. The head is of the Sosikles type and does not belong. The statue was housed in the Villa Mattei from 1614. It was sold to the Vatican in 1770. This statue, which is of high quality, is the name-piece of the so-called Amazon Mattei type, known in a number of replicas. It is an over life-size statue of a standing woman, with a strong, muscular physique. She wears a short, belted riding chiton, which is fastened on the right shoulder but open on the other side so that the left breast is exposed. The chiton is fastened at the waist with a knotted belt, visible on the figure's right side but disappearing beneath the folds of the chiton on the left side. There is a short overfold below the belt. The skirt falls to the knee on the right side, but on the left side it is hitched up with the hem brought up under the belt, so that much of the left thigh is 43 Becatti (1951) 196; Zanker (1974) 87f., pl. 68, 2; Bol (1998) 187 and 215. 44 Bol (1998) 214.</page><page sequence="32">10 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS revealed. The fabric of the dress is characterized by very fine folds of cloth arranged in close pleats, giving a crinkly effect to the material. The woman stands with her weight on her right leg and the foot set fully on the ground. The left leg is slightly raised and bent as the foot, which is set forwards and turned a little way out, has the heel raised off the ground. The right shoulder is raised, and the left is lowered, indicating that the right upper arm was raised too, while the left was lowered. As a result, the right side of the body is taut, while the left side is slack, making the upper body and left shoulder lean slightly to the left. The Amazon has a closed quiver on her left side, which is partially covered at the back by folds of the chiton. A plain, flat quiver strap can be seen running over the right shoulder, disappearing beneath folds of cloth a little above the waist band. This is the only marble copy which retains its original plinth, upon which are a helmet, near the Amazon's left foot, and a tree-trunk support, with pelta and axe, on her right side. Her left foot is adorned with a buckled strap. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R. (1998) 208, cat. no. III.3, pls. 110, 111, 130d-f, 131a, b, 132 c, d, 138 a, b. Helbig, W. (1963) Vol. I, no. 126. Weber, M.

Augustan. The statue has been broken in several places and mended, in most cases with antique pieces which belong to the statue. Restored in Carrara marble are the neck, the right arm and a part of the breast, the left upper arm and most of the hand (but not the wrist), the bow, part of the right thigh and the right foot, the left leg from the middle of the thigh to below the knee, the toes of the left foot, the plinth with the helmet, and the upper part of the support with the rim of the pelta. The head, which is of Sosikles type, does not belong, and was restored by Cavaceppi in the 18th century. The piece was bought from the Villa d'Este in 1753 by Benedict XIV, together with the Capitoline/Sosikles replica, and subsequently presented to the museum. It may have been found on the Palatine, and acquired by the Cardinal d'Este in 1570. This statue of an Amazon conforms closely in dress, drapery folds, and pose to the Mattei Amazon statue. Like the Mattei statue, it is of high quality, and it is regarded by some as the most faithful to the original. It is the only copy, for instance, which includes the detail of rivets on the quiver strap, a feature which can be seen on one of the Baiae cast fragments. The left heel is lifted slightly higher off the ground than that of the Mattei statue, with the result that the left leg is bent somewhat more sharply. The same pattern of folds is maintained on the chiton, though the curling edge of the chiton on the left side and at the back is more ample. The relief decorations on the quiver are also rather more ornate than those of the Mattei statue. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R. (1990) fig. 80. Bol, R. (1998) 206-07, cat. no.

Restored are the tip of the nose, the right arm, the left arm from the shoulder, the legs from the knees down, the tree trunk with pelta and axe, the helmet and plinth. The quiver is broken off at the back, reworked below and restored at the front. On the left hip is a support for the hand or wrist. The head is ancient, but it probably does not belong. The statue was bought in Rome in 1750 by Matthew Brettingham the younger. This statue conforms in pose and dress to the type of the Mattei Amazon. The layout of the chiton is very similar to that of the Mattei statue, but the folds, which are fewer in number, appear less fine, and the cloth is more heavily bunched up at the belt on the left side. The pose appears stiffer and straighter than in the Mattei and Capitoline examples of the type. The head turns gently to the right, as in the reconstructed Mattei and Capitoline statues. This is not true to the type, in which the head was turned to the left, as proved by the neck positions of the Trier and Turin replicas as well as the Natter gem. The head is characterized by large features in a rather thin, long face. The lips, which are very full, are closed. The eyes are clumsily executed with large, heavily marked eyelids. The hair is parted in the middle and thick waves of undulating hair cover the head and frame the forehead, giving it a strongly triangular shape. At the back, the hair is rolled up. The coiffure is held in place by a taenia. The lower parts of the earlobes are just visible. This head type is probably correctly interpreted as a variation of the Sciarra Amazon head type.

To judge from the pose of the figure on the Natter gem, the statue's preserved right arm and hand probably provide a closer reflection of the original bronze statue than the restored right arms of the Mattei, Capitoline and Petworth statues. In this case, the right arm is held high above the head and the vertically positioned hand clutches the remains of a thin, cylindrical shaft. On the other hand, this statue deviates from the type in certain important respects. On the upper thigh a wound is apparent, and drops of blood are plastically rendered issuing from it. This feature does not recur on any other copy of the type. Added to this, the legs are set further apart, making the pose more solid, and the left arm is held further away from the body. The quiver is open, and arrows can be seen at the ready. No bow is depicted beneath the quiver, as in the Trier torso and the Natter gem. It is possible that the type has been adapted to show a fighting Amazon, perhaps holding a bow, rather than a spear. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R. (1990) 221, figs. 85-86, 97 a-d. Bol, R.

The lower half of the quiver is broken off. There are no restorations. The back is only roughly finished, probably indicating that the statue was made to stand in a niche. In the middle of the back a lead-</page><page sequence="35">AMAZON OF EPHESOS 1 3 filled dowel hole remains. On the left shoulder blade the letters EI have been crudely incised - either part of a name or a number. The torso was found in the winter of 1845/1846, in the old baths of the western suburb of St. Barbara at Trier. The torso comes from an Amazon of the Mattei type, as can be seen from the arrangement of the chiton and the remains of the limbs, which suggest that the left leg was set relaxed and that the right arm was raised, while the left was lowered. As in the case of the Petworth statue, another copy of the Antonine period, the fabric of the chiton appears thicker and heavier than that of the Mattei and Capitoline statues. The remains of the neck indicate that the head was lightly bent to the left, as in the Turin torso and the Natter gem. A closed quiver is fastened to the belt on the left side and beneath it can be seen the curving upper part of a bow, strapped to the quiver. This is the only sculptural copy which preserves part of the bow, a feature found again on the Natter gem. BIBLIOGRAPHY Binsfeld, W. (1988) no. 527. Bol, R. (1990) 221, fig. 84, cat. no. 100. Bol, R.

TURIN AMAZON MATTEI TORSO Turin, Museo di Antichità, 284. Torso. H. 0.72m. Dark grey sandstone. From Egypt, ex. Coll. Drovetti. Later 1st century AD. The surviving part of the statue extends from the thighs to the shoulders and the lower neck. The neck shows that the head leaned slightly to the left side. Earlier restorations in black marble have been removed. The left side of the thorax is badly damaged and two long fracture lines cross the back obliquely. There are two holes on the left flank at waist level, for the attachment of the belt. The work has been in the Turin Museum collection since at least 1823. The pose and drapery of this piece indicate that it is a copy of the Mattei Amazon type. But the material, the reduced size, and the fact that the quiver was made separately and attached, perhaps in a different material, distinguish the statue from other copies of the type. The bodily forms are more compact and muscular than the Mattei and Capitoline examples, and the simplified drapery folds are heavier and thicker. In the place where the quiver would have covered part of the chiton, the chiton folds are nonetheless executed. The quiver strap lacks studs. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bardelli, P. (1931) 18, 42. Becatti, G.

(Fig. 1.10) Rome, Villa Albani, 63. Herm head. H. 0.26m (chin to top of head). Marble, perhaps Italian. Hadrianic. The nose, a piece of the hair on the left side of the parting and the edge of the left ear have been restored. The back has been worked over. The surface of the face and neck is pitted. The slight lean of the head to the left side accords with the Trier and Turin copies of the Amazon Mattei type. Wavy hair, which is parted in the middle, is arranged in a thick, undulating mass over the temples, covering the top of the ears. The hair is rolled up at the back. On the crown of the head, the hair lies close to the skull. The middle parting, the thickly undulating hair over the temples, and the strands of hair coming up from the neck behind the ears show some similarities with the hairstyle of the Moni Loukou Karyatid head, though in the latter case the wavy crown is much fuller and less tightly bound than in the case of the Albani herm head. The face itself is lean and it has a fairly pointed chin. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R. (1998) 214, cat. no. III. 15, pls. 126, 127a. Brunn, H. and Bruckmann, F. (1888-1895) 532. Linfert, A.

KARYATID AMAZON FROM MONI LOUKOU, ARKADIA (Fig. 1.9) Athens, NM, 705. Karyatid. H. (of figure alone) 1.90m. Marble. From the villa of Herodes Atticus, Moni Loukou. Around AD 160-70. The Karyatid, bearing a Corinthian pilaster capital on her head, was found broken into four pieces, with breaks at the neck, in the middle of the upper legs and above the ankles. Both arms are missing from the shoulders. The outer edges of the feet, with the little toes, are also missing, along with fragments of the legs and neck along the break lines. The big toe of the right foot is damaged. The face is very battered, particularly the nose, mouth and chin. The figure itself has no restorations. The sculpture was found before 1830 in the Monastery of St. Luke near Astros in Kynouria (Thyreatis), Arkadia, where Herodes Atticus had a villa. The Karyatid Amazon may have been on the Propylon of one of the buildings. The piece represents the figure of an Amazon carved in very high relief against a pillar, with a quiver resting by her right leg. The relaxed left leg is slightly flexed and the heel is raised off the ground, but the foot is set forwards and it is the foot of the right leg which is turned out a little way, unlike copies of the Amazon Mattei type. The fabric of the chiton</page><page sequence="38">1 6 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS appears thick and voluminous, and its arrangement deviates from the Amazon Mattei type in so far as it is fastened with two girdles, both of which are hidden under folds of cloth, there is a long overfold over the hips, and the skirt comes down to the level of both knees. Remains of the shoulders, however, suggest that the arm positions followed the type, with the right arm raised and the left lowered and held close to the body. The slight turn of the head to the left, which is found again in the Turin and Trier replicas, and the noticeable lean of the body to the left side, seen in the Natter gem and probably confirmed by the Baiae foot fragment, would seem to accord more closely with the type than the more upright position adopted in some of the free-standing marble copies. Although very damaged, the head may provide some evidence for the lost Mattei Amazon head type. It is characterized by a low, wide brow, and a mass of thick, undulating hair parted at the centre. The hair covers the upper part of the ears, and strands of hair rising from the neck are apparent behind the ears, suggesting that the hair was rolled up at the back. The hair lies close to the head on the crown. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) pl. 89, fig. 280. Bol, R. (1990) 220, fig. 83. Bol, R. (1998) 211, cat. no. III.8, pls. 123-25, 138f. Bothmer, D. V.

Provenance unknown. 1st century AD. The gem was at one time owned by George Montagu, Earl of Halifax (1716-1771). From 1740, it was owned by Dr. Richard Mead (1673-1754). It was acquired on March 11th, 1755, by Thomas Hollis (1720-1774) at Lanford, London (no. 48). It was in the collection of Thomas Brand-Hollis until 1804, then John Disney Snr. (1746-1816) and John Disney Jnr. (1779-1857). Sold on July 3rd, 1821 at Sotheby's (lot 66) to Francis Duroveray, it remained in his gem collection until this was in turn sold at Christie's on March 26th, 1849. The gem, which is now lost, is known only through the following sources: 1. Drawing by Lorenz Natter. An Amazon is depicted leaning on a spear. Her pose is reminiscent of the Mattei Amazon type because of the pondération, the raised left heel and the arm positions. The position of the right arm is similar to that of the Capitolino statue, but the hand is set vertically, as in the Tivoli statue. The arrangement of the chiton follows the type with regard to the belt which, if a little high, is visible at the waist at the front and on the right side. In addition, the skirt is raised higher on the left side, revealing part of the thigh. On the other hand, the thickness of the cloth, the long overfall to the hips, apparently secured with a second, lower belt, and the arrangement of the folds, which are</page><page sequence="39">AMAZON OF EPHESOS 1 7 relatively thick and few in number, find a closer parallel in the Moni Loukou Karyatid than in any of the free-standing replicas of the Mattei Amazon type. The characteristic way in which the hem of the chiton on the left side is brought up and tucked into the belt in the Mattei type is not found on this drawing. The Amazon has a quiver on her left side and a bow, and she steadies the shaft of a spear in her hands. Almost all the Mattei Amazon replicas have a quiver on the left side and, while the Trier torso shows the remains of a bow on the left side, the right hand of the Capitolino statue clutches a long cylindrical shaft which may well have been that of a spear. The hairstyle, which shows centrally parted waves of hair, and which is completed with a taenia, is not dissimilar to that of the head of the Petworth statue. 2. Carnelian copy by Lorenz Natter, now in Leiden, Rijksmuseum, and earlier in The Hague, made by Natter between 1747 and 1751 when he was working for William IV. 3. Glass pastes made by James Tassie (1735-1799) after a sulphur paste in the Philipp von Stosch collection (1691-1757) and published by Raspe46: (a) St. Petersburg, Hermitage, (b) Edinburgh, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, (c) London, Victoria and Albert Museum In a general way, the carnelian and the glass pastes agree with Natter's drawing of the stone, but there are some important differences to be observed. On the carnelian and the glass pastes, the figure leans more noticeably towards the spear and the head is lightly turned towards this side, instead of looking keenly ahead. The left leg is less strongly bent at the knee than in the drawing and the spear is set nearer to the left foot, making it useful as a support. The drapery motif over the left thigh, of the chiton that is hitched up and tucked into the belt, which is not understood in the drawing, is apparent in the carnelian and the glass pastes. According to Platz-Horster, the interior measurements of all three Tassie pastes fit the circumference of Natter's engraving. All three Tassie pastes must therefore come from the same original. This would also explain an impurity in the picture field to the left and a scroll or spiral below the raised arm next to the covered breast, features which can all be observed on the Tassie pastes and Natter's engraving. Natter criticized the original gem for not being of a very high quality, especially with regard to the left leg, which he thought must have been supported, at least with drapery, by the antique artist. Natter must have been unaware that the antique gem cutter was attempting to depict a statue from the front, as was usual in the early Imperial period. He considered most of the gems in his Treaty as ancient and copied many in order to understand ancient gem cutting. For his own copy of the original, the Leiden gem, he used a different material, the carnelian, and he chose a large size for convenience. Despite his criticism of the original work, his own result was distinctly heavier. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R. (1990) cat. no. 101. Bol, R. (1998) 212-13, cat. no. III.ll, pls. 122, 131c, 140a.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE There are three passages in Pausanias's description of the sculptures at Olympia which tell of representations of athletes which may have been made by Pheidias. In the long description of the image of Zeus in his temple at Olympia, Pausanias, V.l 1.3, writes that the throne had bars between the legs and that the bar straight in front of the entrance was sculpted with figures showing boys in contests. One of these is described as tying a fillet round his head ('Anadoumenos') and as looking like Pantarkes, the Eleian youth whom Pheidias loved. This sculpture was presumably a relief made in wood or ivory. In VI. 4. 5, Pausanias mentions with great admiration a free-standing statue of an 'Anadoumenos', which he says was made by Pheidias, though he adds that he has no idea whom the figure represents. The wording of the description of the statue is almost exactly the same as that of the Pantarkes figure. The statue was probably made of bronze, like so many other athlete statues in the sanctuary, and it is likely to have dated from the 430s BC, when Pheidias was working in Olympia. Since most of Pausanias's information in this book is drawn from the inscriptions accompanying the statues he describes, it is possible that at least a part of the dedicatory inscription of this work had been lost by the mid-second century AD. Finally, in VI. 10.6, Pausanias describes a statue of Pantarkes, the boys' wrestling champion, which apparently stood beyond a statue of Ikkos. This time the name of the sculptor of the work is not mentioned and the pose of the statue is not described. It was probably another bronze statue. We may cautiously conclude as follows from these passages. Both the relief Anadoumenos and the free-standing Anadoumenos were by Pheidias, according to Pausanias, but the identity of the latter was not known to Pausanias, while that of the former seems to have been no more than a popular belief (Xeyouai, says Pausanias). The free-standing statue of Pantarkes is not attributed to Pheidias nor is its pose described. Whether or not Pheidias 's Anadoumenos statue represented Pantarkes is not known and remains speculative. Whether or not the Pantarkes statue was another athlete statue by Pheidias, of similar or different type to the Anadoumenos, remains equally unknown. It is possible that the figure on the throne bar was known as Pantarkes because it resembled the named statue of this boy. But it is equally possible that the story had grown out of the popular idea that Pantarkes was Pheidias 's favourite. All that is clear is that, in addition to the relief figures of athletes on the throne bar, Pheidias made at least one free-standing athlete statue at Olympia, and this was an Anadoumenos. 21</page><page sequence="44">22 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 2.2. ATTRIBUTIONS Two sculptural types have been associated with the athlete of Pheidias recorded in the sources. Becatti attributed both of these types to Pheidias as he was of the opinion that two different athlete statues were made by Pheidias.47 The Petworth head type, named after the head in the Petworth collection (Fig. 2.1-2), is known in four other replicas: those in Florence, New York (Fig. 2.3), Trier and a head which used to be in the Abbati collection.48 The type represents a victorious athlete, as is indicated by the fillet tied round the head. The long, narrow head is turned slightly to its left and the facial features are well modelled. The eyes have heavy lids, the nose is narrow and the full lips droop slightly at the corners. The hair lies in masses of thick curls around the head with locks standing out like spirals. The fillet holds some of the curls down but at the back of the head it disappears beneath the hair. Its ends were tucked into the band on either side above the temples. The Greek prototype seems to have had one arm resting on the top of the head, to judge from the remains of a support on the heads of the Petworth, New York and Abbati copies. It is not certain which arm was raised but as the hair is slightly flattened on the right side it could have been the right arm, in the manner of the Athena Mattei. The athlete was not, therefore, an 'Anadoumenos' strictly speaking, but just an athlete resting. Richter dated the original in the third quarter of the 5th century BC but refrained from making an attribution to a particular sculptor.49 Her date was based on Furtwängler's comparison with the portrait of Perikles attributed to Kresilas; Furtwängler even suggested Kresilas as the master of the original of the head.50 Many scholars agree that the head type goes back to Pheidias, though they disagree strongly about the identity of the figure. Floren, following Arndt and Lippold, has attributed the head type to the Amazon Mattei, a statue type generally linked with Pheidias. But Bol has argued strongly and, according to Raeder, conclusively, that the Petworth head depicts a male athlete.51 Schmidt, who was followed by Poulsen, argued that the head copied Pheidias's Anadoumenos.52 Becatti, on the other hand, while believing in the association with Pheidias, was of the opinion that the head belonged to Pheidias's statue of Pantarkes; Becatti thought that Pheidias made two athlete statues, and that the one with this head type, of which five copies exist, was the more famous. Picón has taken a more cautious line, placing the original of the head in the late 5th century BC and concluding that the "identity of the sculptor responsible for the 47 Becatti (1951) 151-55. 48 According to Raeder (2000) 49-50 the earliest copy, dating from the Augustan period, is the Petworth head. 49 Richter (1954) catalogue no. 54. 50 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 161 ff.

The statue shows a nude standing youth, tying a band or 'taenia' round his head. Both arms were raised, but the left is lost. He stands principally on the right leg, while the left is placed slightly to the side, with the sole of the foot fully on the ground. By the side of the statue are the remains of a palm-support. Becatti believed that the Diadoumenos Farnese was a copy of the Anadoumenos by Pheidias, depicted on the throne of the Zeus at Olympia, and that the reason why it was not often copied was because it was not as well-known as the figure of Pantarkes, the youth Pheidias loved.57 This theory was related to the high date given by Becatti to the image of Zeus, which he thought antedated the Athena Parthenos. The Diadoumenos Farnese was believed to fit nicely around the middle of the century whereas the Petworth head type was considered to be later. Becatti therefore thought that the Petworth head belonged to a later statue which could conveniently be the Pantarkes who won the boy's wrestling competition in the 86th Olympiad: 436 BC. Nevertheless, as the temple image has now been dated in the 430s BC on external evidence - the finds in the workshop - Becatti 's complicated attribution of both statue types to Pheidias and to two different athletes has to be rejected. The fact that only one copy exists, and a rather mediocre one at that, has led Zanker to define the statue as a Roman copy of a classicistic original from the early 1st century BC based on the famous Diadoumenos of Polykleitos, best known in the replica from Delos, now in Athens.58 Boardman, however, considers the Diadoumenos Farnese to be a copy of an original of about 450-440 BC, showing the pre-Polykleitan stance with both heels on the ground, and variously associated with Pheidias and Polykleitos.59 Corso agrees with such a date for the original of the type. He is of the opinion that the Farnese statue has suffered from over-enthusiastic polishing, giving it a softness of line which is probably more in keeping with the tastes of the copyist than with the original concept.

CATALOGUE 1. PETWORTH HEAD (Figs. 2.1-2) Petworth House, no. 24. Head. H. 0.645m; ancient part, 0.311m. Marble. Provenance unknown. Augustan. The head and neck are ancient, but they have been mounted on a modern bust. The tip of the nose has been restored in marble. The top of the left ear, part of the outer edge of the right ear and some of the ends of the curls are broken off. The face is slightly chipped, but otherwise it is in good condition. The head was acquired by Charles Wyndham, second earl of Egremont, who died in 1763. There is a cast of the head and bust in Holkham Hall. This seems to have been supplied by Matthew Brettingham, through whose agencies most of the Holkham Hall collection was bought in the 1750s. If so, then it seems likely that the Petworth bust was acquired in Rome too. According to C. Townley, it came from the Palazzo Barberini in Rome. Another cast now in the Mengs Collection in Dresden, dating from around 1725-50, was taken before the bust came to England, according to Wyndham. This head of a victorious athlete is known in a further four Graeco-Roman sculptures. According to Raeder, it is the earliest replica of the type and probably the most faithful. The details of the curls, for instance, are rendered with a precision which is not matched by the other copies. The youth has short, curly hair, depicted in deeply carved, thick, unruly locks, and strongly idealizing features. The contours of his cheeks, and even more so of his chin, are quite rounded, and his relatively small mouth has full lips. His eyelids are prominently indicated, the upper eyelid drooping over the lower at the outer corner. The change in plane from the eyebrows to the eye sockets is sharp and angular, and the line of the eyebrows merges with the line of the nose. On his forehead can be seen a broad, flat fillet. It is bound around the head, crossing at the front, and, instead of being tied at the back in the usual way, the ends are neatly tucked in under the band on each temple.

ABBATI HEAD OF PETWORTH TYPE Location unknown, formerly Abbati. Head. Probably marble. The nose is broken off and the lips are damaged. The head of a youth wearing a fillet conforms to the type of the Petworth head in the arrangement of the hair and the fillet, and in the facial features. It is a good quality replica, but its details cannot be studied as it has disappeared. Like the Petworth and New York heads, traces of puntelli on the head suggest that one hand or forearm originally rested on the head. The face appears fuller and rounder in form than that of the New York or Petworth heads, and the eyes, which are bigger, dominate more forcefully. The fillet disappears completely under the hair at the back of the head, and the small curls above the nape of the neck are quite disorganized, unlike on the Petworth head. The ears differ too, in that they are rounder in shape. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 151-55. Brunn, H. and Bruckmann, F. (1888-1895) no. 84. Floren, J. (1992) 119ff., pl. 12, 1-2. Raeder, J.

The head is broken across the bottom of the neck. The end of the nose and pieces of the hair are missing. A crack runs through the outer corner of the right eye. The surface is encrusted in places. The remains of a puntello, rising vertically from the top of the head, suggest that one arm was originally raised and rested on the crown of the head. The piece was purchased in Rome (Roger's Fund, 1911). The head conforms to the type of the Petworth head. The general pattern of the hair and taenia is similar, but details differ. The taenia is not quite so wide. The hair is dominated by snail-shell curls with drilled centres. The pattern of short waves parting above the middle of the forehead, which can be seen on the Petworth head, is lost in favour of a more unruly arrangement. The facial features are similar, but they are less sharply defined and they give the impression that the subject is more youthful. The upper eyelids are heavier.</page><page sequence="48">26 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 151-55, pls. 80-82. Mertens, J. R., ed. (1987) 65. Raeder, J. (2000) 50, no. 2.

The right upper part of the head survives, with some of the hair, the fillet, the right ear, the right eye and cheek. It comes probably from a relief from a wall revetment. The head was found in the frigidarium of the Barbara Baths, in a semicircular recess on the north front. It was found with a headless statue of the Amazon Mattei type and initially interpreted as the head for this type. The Amazon statue, however, is executed fully in the round, unlike this fragmentary head. The head is very fragmentary, and yet it is recognizably of the same type as the Petworth head. The large, tight curls are arranged in the manner of the Petworth type, closely following both the Petworth and New York examples. One end of the taenia can be seen clearly on the right and it is depicted in the same manner as on the Petworth head. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. (1930) 1-4. Becatti, G. (1951) 151-55. Floren, J.

The left arm and shoulder, the nose, part of the right thumb and the left end of the taenia are all missing. A dowel hole for the attachment of the end of the taenia is visible on the lower part of the head on the left side. The hair is very weathered and rather indistinct. The right leg appears to be ancient but it has been mended and worked over. The taenia is rather chipped. The statue was acquired from the Farnese Collection in 1864. It is first recorded in the Villa Madama in Rome. It was afterwards in the Farnese Gardens, the Palazzo Farnese, and at Naples. The statue is of a standing, naked youth, tying a ribbon around his head. He stands with his weight on his right leg, while the relaxed left leg is placed a little to the side, with the sole of the foot set fully on the ground. Beside the right leg are the remains of a palm trunk support. The right arm is bent at the elbow and the forearm is raised so that the hand can hold one end of the taenia. Judging from the remains of the left shoulder, it</page><page sequence="49">ANADOUMENOS 27 seems that the left upper arm was held higher than the right. The left hand would have been holding the other end of the taenia. The head, which is lowered and turned slightly to the figure's right, has short curly hair into which the broad band of the taenia sinks as it is drawn tight and knotted at the back. Waves and open curls radiate from the crown, and there is some hair before the ears and beneath the fillet. The face is characterized by large eyes, set far apart, full lips, and a small pointed chin. The eyebrows seem to droop close over the eyes at the outer edges. BIBLIOGRAPHY Boardman, J.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE The sources mention two statues of Aphrodite Ourania by Pheidias: one a chryselephantine version in the sanctuary of Aphrodite in Elis, the other a marble work of unknown appearance in the sanctuary situated in the northwestern area of the Agora of Athens. Pausanias, VI.25.1, states that the statue of Aphrodite at Elis, which was in a temple in the Agora, was a chryselephantine work by Pheidias, an attribution which is supported by Plutarch.61 Psellos adds that the goddess's eyes were inset with black stone while her body was made of gold.62 Plutarch says that the goddess was represented standing with one foot on a tortoise, but that he does not know the significance of the animal in this context. His guess, which seems doubtful considering the nature of the goddess in question, is that the tortoise represented the traditional Greek female virtues of staying at home, thereby not exposing oneself to outsiders, and silence. As Settis demonstrates, the tortoise, which was frequently presented as a votive offering in sanctuaries, was probably significant in a number of different ways.63 It had heavenly connotations, in that its arched shell was recognized in the constellation of the 'Lyre'. It was also seen as a chthonic being, bringing death and transporting heroes to the underworld. The same name was also used to signify 'turtle' in Greek, hence there was a strong association with the sea. Thus the animal might symbolize the goddess's powers over land, sea and sky, and all the creatures that inhabit them. The marine aspect of the animal reminds one of Aphrodite's own birth out of the sea, and this in turn helps to explain the title 'Ourania'. For it was the seed of Ouranos, cast into the sea, that produced the goddess. In 1.14.7, Pausanias says that the title 'Ourania' was first used by peoples of the Near East: the Assyrians, followed by the people of Paphos in Cyprus, the Phoenicians and the Kytherans. The Near Eastern origin of the title ties in well with the goddess's pose in Pheidias 's representation, for the action of treading on an animal's back had its roots in Oriental Epiphany representations. It can be found in many works of the Archaic period.64 Pheidias seems to have popularized the motif of the goddess with one foot on a tortoise, a motif which remained common well into the Hellenistic period. The raised foot which almost appears to be climbing a stair is interesting. It refers strongly to an 'anodos' and can be seen on vases and in statues, in 61 Some parts of the Agora of Elis have been excavated, but the temple of Aphrodite has not yet been discovered. For the attribution to Pheidias, see Plutarch, Conj. Praec. 32. 62 Psellos, Pros Pothon, 9. 63 Settis (1966) 27-94. 64 See, for instance, Berlin, Staatl. Mus. 31084, a mirror-handle of the later 6th century BC. LI MC Aphrodite no. 373. Aphrodite is shown standing with both feet on the animal's back. 29</page><page sequence="51">30 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS connection with both Aphrodite, rising out of the sea, and Persephone, coming up from the underworld. See for instance, the Ancona pyxis, which shows Aphrodite with one foot on the ground line, as if she were climbing out of a hole; the Syracuse hydria, showing Aphrodite with her left knee raised; and the early Classical torso in Corinth which represents a young girl in an ungirt peplos, probably correctly identified as Aphrodite, with her left knee raised and her right arm originally raised and stretched forward, perhaps towards Eros, who is ready to receive her.65 Commenting on a passage in Clemens Alexandrinus, where the author says that Pheidias wrote "Pantarkes is beautiful" on the finger of the Zeus at Olympia, Arethas reports that, according to Libanios, the graffito was on the finger of Pheidias's Aphrodite.66 This is sometimes thought to be a reference to the Aphrodite Ourania at Elis, but there are strong reasons for doubting the idea. For one thing, Arethas does not specify which of Pheidias's Aphrodite statues is meant. Secondly, Arethas does not give an exact reference to Libanios. The statement cannot be found in the extant works of Libanios. In the opinion of Corso, Arethas may be misremembering a passage in Eunapios, where Eunapios mentions Libanios and a comment he made about one of the Pheidian goddess statues.67 According to Eunapios, Libanios was simply saying that, just as Homer did not worry about every foot of his verse but tried to ensure the overall beauty of the work, so Pheidias did not care about displaying "a finger or a foot to gain praise for his goddess".68 The reference is more likely to be to Pheidias's most famous goddess statue, namely the Athena Parthenos. Arethas correctly reports that Gregorios Nazianzenos says the graffito was on one of the fingers of the Athena Parthenos.69 Given the available evidence concerning Pheidias's life, it seems probable that the Aphrodite at Elis was commissioned and created in the period after the completion of the Zeus at Olympia, when Pheidias was still at the height of his powers and greatly appreciated in that area. This probably means the late years of the 430s BC. It should be remembered that Pheidias had given Aphrodite a fairly prominent position in the Olympian Zeus composition, where her birth featured in the frieze of the statue base. In 1.14.7, Pausanias states that above the Kerameikos and near the shrine of Hephaistos in Athens was a sanctuary of Aphrodite Ourania, containing a statue of the goddess in Parian marble by Pheidias. He does not describe the iconography of the work at all, and there is no other known source to support Pausanias 's attribution. On the grounds that there was probably little building activity in the Agora while work was in progress on the Akropolis, Harrison argues that the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens probably does not date from before 420 BC.70 Such a date would be too late for Pheidias, but would suit 65 Ancona pyxis, AR V 899, no. 144; Syracuse hydria, ARV , 1041, no. 11; Corinth torso, inv. no.

As she says, this would not be the only example of a piece of work by Agorakritos being assigned to his master, Pheidias: others are the Nemesis at Rhamnous and perhaps the Mother of the Gods in the Athenian Metroon.71 One should be wary, however, of brushing aside Pausanias's attribution to Pheidias of the Athenian Aphrodite Ourania. Recent excavations in the northwest corner of the Agora have revealed the site of the sanctuary of Aphrodite, which Pausanias visited on his way from the Hephaisteion to the Stoa Poikile, and there are signs that the large sanctuary altar, of which there are substantial remains, was repaired during the 430s or 420s BC. It is also thought that the temple of Aphrodite was built under Perikles.72 If this is correct then one would expect the Athenian statue to have been made by Pheidias some time before his departure from Athens after the completion of the Parthenos. 3.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The statue most often associated with Pheidias' s chryselephantine Aphrodite at Elis is the Aphrodite Brazzà in Berlin (Fig. 3.1).73 This statue lacks its head, neck and undraped left shoulder, its left forearm and the support, and most of its right arm.74 The raised left foot and the accompanying tortoise were restored in the early 19th century. The tortoise is generally believed to follow antique remains, though this still remains to be proved. The statue, which is over life-size, represents a young woman wearing a belted chiton, a himation which is draped over the lower body, and thick-soled sandals. The figure stands with her weight on the right leg while the left is raised and the foot steps forward. Her left arm, which was bent at the elbow, rests on a support, most of which is broken away, but which appears to have been a female herm. The chiton sleeve slips off the left shoulder, leaving it uncovered. The attractive and sensuous form of the figure, accentuated by the use of transparent drapery over the breasts and the abdomen, point to its identification as Aphrodite. At first glance, the drapery style and the build are reminiscent of the style of the Parthenon, especially the female pedimental figures of the east front.75 Comparable features include the slender hips, the broad shoulders and the widely separated breasts of the goddess, as well as the chiton slipping off the left shoulder and the curving folds of drapery which reveal and highlight the abdomen. While admitting the Parthenonian style of the piece, many scholars agree that the statue is a Roman copy, probably of a late 5th 71 Pausanias, 1.33.2 and 1.3.5, respectively. 72 Shear (1984) 24-40; Camp (1986) 57. 73 Berlin, Sk 1459. 74 The head type of the Brazzà statue is not known, and various conjectures have been made. Croissant (1971) 89, figs. 9-10 wanted to restore the head type known from the Aries theatre bust. Lauter (1988) figs. 2-3, however, showed that the bust is later in date than the Berlin statue and cannot belong. 75 Schräder (1924) 268.</page><page sequence="53">32 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS century or early 4th century BC Attic original.76 Signs of the use of the running drill for the folds of the chiton on the left side, the piecing of the bust, arms and support, and the lack of careful attention to technical details, all indicate Roman workmanship.77 Hofkes- Brukker observed parallels in pose and drapery between the Aphrodite Brazzà and the sculptures of the Erechtheion frieze, which date from the period 410-406 BC.78 The advanced left leg with the mantle falling over the thigh of female figure, Akropolis Museum no. 1077, may be compared with the Aphrodite Brazzà, though the left foot is not raised in the Erechtheion sculpture (Fig. 3.2).79 The arrangement of the folds of the himation over the legs in thick, widely spaced curves in the Brazzà statue finds a parallel in Akropolis Museum no. 1072 (Fig. 3. 3). 80 Hofkes-Brukker's careful comparison of the technical and stylistic differences between the works led her to the conclusion that the Aphrodite Brazzà type cannot date earlier than the late 5th century BC.81 The fact that similar works were produced in Athens suggests that the type was known there and may indeed have originated there.82 The Aphrodite Brazzà type is too late in date, therefore, to qualify as a faithful copy of a Pheidian work which was perhaps produced in the late 430s BC. But it seems probable that the type is at least derived from the Aphrodite at Elis. The pose of the advanced and raised left foot may well be inspired by the Pheidian statue. Whether or not the Brazzà statue had one foot on a tortoise, Pheidias's statue certainly did, for this information is preserved for us by Pausanias. Ridgway drew attention to the stiff and awkward nature of the pose, in which the leaning motif of the upper body is combined with the action of stepping forwards rather than just resting a foot on the tortoise's back.83 The presence of 76 For a summary of scholars' views concerning the date of this piece see Delivorrias et al (1984) 28, no. 177. 77 Ridgway (1981) 217.

See also Croissant (1971) and (2001). 82 The statue was in Venice for most of the 19th century and perhaps earlier. As some Greek originals were brought from Greece to Venice in the 17th century, it is possible that the statue originally came from Attica. There seem to be no secure grounds for describing the Berlin Aphrodite as coming from Smyrna, as Boardman does (1985) fig. 213. Schräder mentions a very fragmentary torso from a statue of a similar type coming from Philadelphia, which was in Smyrna and has since disappeared. According to Picard (1939) Manuel 2. 2, 567-68, fig. 232, it later reappeared in Africa. This torso is discussed in an article by Pottier (1881) 279-82, pl. 13. It was 0.95m high, and had the left shoulder and hip raised, the right shoulder and hip lowered, and the left leg set forward. It was considered to be in the style of the Erechtheion frieze, and was dated to the time of Attalos II of Pergamon. In LIMC II (1984), Aphrodite no. 194, the statue is listed under Classical Aphrodite depictions, the unveiled supported or leaning type (as a copy of Alkamenes's Aphrodite in the Gardens, LIMC II (1984), Aphrodite no. 193). 83 Ridgway (1981) 217 saw the work as a classicizing creation.</page><page sequence="54">APHRODITE OURANIA 33 the support and the slipping drapery on the left side create the impression that the figure leans, but Harrison thinks that this is contradicted by the active movement of the left leg and she supposes that the figure simply rests its left arm on the support.84 She is therefore of the opinion that the Pheidian statue would not have leant to one side, even if the motif of the support under the left arm goes back to Pheidias's work. The presence of a female herm would not be inappropriate, providing as it does a reminder of Aphrodite's veiy ancient origins. Harrison also maintains that, as Aphrodite Ourania, the goddess would have been depicted as a grown woman, wearing a girdled dress. Instead of the chiton of the Brazzà type, she favours a heavy peplos, adorned with many patterns, as in the case of the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos and her Nike.85 Harrison suggests the so-called 'Sappho' head type for the Aphrodite at Elis.86 She rejects the usual association of this head type with the 'Olympias' body type, on the grounds that several replicas of the type turned to the figure's right, while the 'Olympias' body, she thinks, requires a head turning the other way. Harrison argues that the head type points to a chryselephantine original, firstly because the hard treatment of the hair in, for example, the Naples 'Sappho' herm reflects a metallic original, such as would have been used on a chryselephantine statue and, secondly, because the existing copies of the 'Sappho' head type diverge quite strongly in many details, suggesting that the head was copied freehand, rather than cast. The problem of the head of the 'Olympias' type remains enigmatical, given the lack of a complete copy of the type, though many scholars agree that a slight turn of the head to the right would be true to the original. There are no known replicas of the Aphrodite Brazzà, though Hellenistic and Roman variations on the theme are frequent.87 More often than not, the figure is not represented with a tortoise, but in these cases not only is Aphrodite represented but so too are Nymphs, Muses and other divinities. The extent of the influence of the Pheidian statue on these later creations remains unknown, though it is possible that at least the motif of the foot on the tortoise goes back to the statue in Elis. One should note that Elis has produced a terracotta fragment of a statuette (Elis, P306) which may belong to a small-scale copy of an Aphrodite standing on a tortoise. It consists of the front part of a foot in a thick-soled sandal resting on the shell of a tortoise.88 Unlike the Brazzà type, the sandal thong is rather ornate and it is the right foot rather than the left that rests on the back of the tortoise. Turning to the Athenian Aphrodite Ourania, the written sources preserve no information concerning its iconography. As noted above, the Aphrodite Brazzà type was probably familiar in Athens and the Brazzà statue itself is made of Pentelic marble. Without further evidence, however, it seems idle to speculate whether Pheidias chose a similar model for his representations of the goddess in Athens and Elis or whether the Brazzà type reflects 84 Harrison (1984) 384 and 386. 85 Harrison (1984) 386. 86 Harrison (1984) 379-88. 87 See Lichocka (1983) 221-238. Dally (1997) 11 suggests that the leaning Aphrodite type is inspired by the Pheidian work reflected in the Brazzà statue. Note Pliny, NH 36.15, who states that Pheidias was supposed to have put the finishing touches to the 'Aphrodite in the Gardens' by Alkamenes. 88 Yalouris (1996) 107, fig. 83.</page><page sequence="55">34 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the Athenian statue rather than the statue in Elis.89 Two other suggestions which have been made about the type of the Athenian Aphrodite Ourania are the Lateran Agrippina type and the Aphrodite 'Doria'. The latter suggestion comes from Delivorrias, while the former was put forward by Harrison, partly because of the discovery of a small, fragmentary replica of the Lateran Agrippina type in the Athenian Agora.90 The Lateran Agrippina type is characterized in its drapery by the fine chiton and the triangular overfold of the himation, both of which features can be seen also on the 'Kore Albani' and the 'Kore Grimani'.91 Harrison labels these, respectively, an "ancestor" and a "variant" of the type. She comments on the influence of the Parthenon pediments and the Nemesis at Rhamnous on the drapery of the type and concludes that it must date from around 425 BC and is probably attributable to Agorakritos. The identification of the 'Kore Albani' as a representation of Aphrodite may have been assured, though this is still disputed, by the discovery of a classicizing variant of the same type carrying Eros on the left arm.92 Baumer argues that the Lateran Agrippina is best understood when seen as belonging to a small group of early Imperial statues which share some of the features of the Kore Albani but which imitate a later work, perhaps contemporary with the Hera Borghese or the sculptures of the temple of Athena Nike.93 The Kore Albani, which is close in style to the Parthenon metopes, is seen as copying an original work of about 440 BC which may belong to Pheidias or his circle.94 Delivorrias prefers to accept Pausanias's word that Pheidias was the sculptor of the Athenian Aphrodite Ourania, and he dates the original of the Aphrodite 'Doria', with which type he identifies it, to the same period as the Parthenon pediments. Thus Delivorrias assumes both that Pheidias remained in Athens after 438 BC, when the Parthenos was dedicated, and that the Zeus at Olympia dates from rather later than usually thought. As shown elsewhere, neither of these assumptions is easy to accept.95 89 See Brommer (1950) 82ff. 90 Delivorrias (1991) 137 n. 14 and (1994a) 651-52; Harrison (1982a) 49-51. 91 Boardman (1985a) figs. 210 and 196.1. 92 Andreae (1983) 54ff.

CATALOGUE 1. APHRODITE BRAZZÀ (Fig. 3.1) Berlin, Staatliche Museen, Sk 1459. Statue. H. 1.58m. Pentelic marble. Probably from Attica. Roman work. The statue, which was broken at waist level, has been put together again. Restorations include two ridges of the folds across the thighs and the left foot with the tortoise, which have been restored in marble, and the left knee, which has been restored in plaster. The left arm and the lower half of the right arm, as well as most of the herm on which the right forearm rested, are lost, as are the head, the neck and the undraped left shoulder which were originally inserted. There is some damage to the torso and the right breast. The statue was acquired by Berlin on the art market in Venice in 1892. For much of the 19th century it was in the Villa Brazzà di Fornazzi at Dolo, having been transferred there from the Palazzo Brazzà in 1820. Its earlier provenance is not known, but it is thought to have been brought to Venice from Attica in the 17th century. This over life-size statue represents a standing woman, draped in a belted chiton and himation and wearing thick-soled sandals with simple straps. The chiton slips off the left shoulder. It clings to the body over the breasts, the abdomen, and the lower left leg, and hangs in thicker folds on the sides of the upper body, over the belt, on the hips and on the lower right leg. The himation hangs over the left forearm, it passes behind the figure over the lower torso, and is brought forward across the thighs, to hang down over the raised left leg. The use of modelling lines and transparent drapery is very reminiscent of the Parthenon sculptures, particularly those of the pediments, and the effect is to enhance the seductiveness of the form. The figure stands with her weight on her right leg, while the left foot is raised on to the back of a tortoise. The left shoulder is set somewhat lower than the right and, from the remains of the lower left arm, it is clear that the arm originally rested on a herm support to the figure's left. Thus the whole figure leans slightly to the left in a very stationary and relaxed pose. The right arm is almost completely missing, but the upper part near the shoulder suggests that it was not held down against the torso. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bieber, M. (1977) 94, figs. 435-36. Blümel, C.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE Pausanias, IX.4.1-2, says that the statue of Athena Areia at Plataia was acrolithic, with a gilded, wooden body and marble face, feet and hands. He adds that it was made by Pheidias, that it was not much smaller than Pheidias's great bronze Athena on the Athenian Akropolis, and that it was constructed from the spoils assigned by the Athenians to the Plataians after the Battle of Marathon. It was housed in a temple of which the pronaos walls were decorated with wall paintings by Onasias and Polygnotos. Plutarch, Ar. 20, states that the sum allocated to the Plataians from the spoils of war amounted to 80 talents, and that this money was used to pay for the rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena, the construction of the statue and the decoration of the temple with wall paintings.96 Plutarch, however, connects the spoils not with the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) but with the Battle of Plataia (479 BC), and this may well be more accurate.97 The later date would certainly accord better with the idea that Pheidias made the statue and Polygnotos painted a picture for the interior of the temple. Both the unusual title of the statue and the temple wall paintings have suggested that the sanctuary project was planned according to a political agenda. The title 'Areia', which does not seem to have been given to a figure of Athena before this time, conjures up the image of a warlike, avenging goddess, who helped her worshippers to victory. According to Höcker and Schneider, by taking over the role and name of Ares, Athena, the patron goddess of Athens, seems to be asserting in a symbolical way her dominance over Ares, the traditional protector of treacherous Thebes.98 This idea was elaborated, they think, in the paintings of the pronaos, which both stressed the important domestic theme of war against traitors. Polygnotos depicted Odysseus after he had killed the Suitors and Onasias, an otherwise unknown artist, the campaign of the Seven against Thebes. Francis, on the other hand, interprets the paintings as references to the battles of Marathon and Plataia: the Seven against Thebes represents the fight against the threatened imposition of tyranny from outside, while the killing of the Suitors represents the justifiable punishment of invaders.99 At the foot of the statue, according to Pausanias, there was a portrait statue of Arimnestos, the commander of the Plataians in both the Battle of Marathon and the Battle of Plataia. Francis is of the opinion that the title 'Areia' for the Athena of this sanctuary 96 Pausanias, IX.4.1-2; Plutarch, Ar. 20. 97 Robertson (1975) 246. 98 Höcker and Schneider (1993) 51. 99 Francis (1990) 74-75. 39</page><page sequence="60">40 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS probably points to a link with Kimon.100 The same title was used in the oath of the ephebes, who, says Lapatin, "played an important role in Kimon's Thesean ideology."101 Several elements in the description of the Plataian sanctuary seem to support the idea that Pheidias was the author of the temple statue. The use of mythological scenes to present a political message and the juxtaposition of statues of a contemporary figure and a deity are both found in other projects which involved Pheidias. Take, for instance, the relief decorations of the Athena Parthenos at Athens, of which the political overtones have long been recognized, even if not fully understood, and the Marathon Monument in Delphi, where Miltiades was represented alongside the gods. In addition, if the Plataian project was connected with Kimon in some way, it would not be surprising to find that both Pheidias and Polygnotos had collaborated on it. Polygnotos, it is known, was associated with Kimon, and Pheidias had probably already come to Kimon's attention because of his work at Delphi on the Marathon monument.102 Pausanias's reference, in IX.4.2, to the artists who worked at the Plataian sanctuary is the only recorded instance of Pheidias's collaboration with the muralist, Polygnotos. Such a connection is not unlikely, however, considering the extent of the influence of early Classical murals that can be felt in the composition of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, which was by Pheidias.103 The Plataian statue is described by Pausanias as being not much smaller than the Athena 'Promachos' at Athens. The 'Promachos' was an outdoor statue of considerable height, judging from Roman coin representations and the fact that its helmet crest and spear point could be seen by sailors approaching Athens from Sounion.104 Estimates of its height vary between about ten and fifteen metres. It is difficult to believe that the Plataian statue, which stood inside a temple, could have been even as much as ten metres high, though Pausanias's comment indicates that it was colossal. If the statue was genuinely by Pheidias, then it clearly marked an important step in his artistic development, for it was a major commission for a young artist, and the idea of the colossal temple statue, partially made of gold, anticipates his later chryselephantine masterpieces in the Parthenon and at Olympia.105 Plutarch does not say who made the Plataian statue. Linfert is of the opinion 100 Francis (1990) 84. 101 Lapatin (2001) 198. 102 por polygnotos's association with Kimon see Meiggs (1972) 275-77 and 573. !03 por a discussion of this matter, see Athena Parthenos, section 3. 104 See, for example, Höcker and Schneider (1993) 58-59, with illustrations. 105 Robertson (1975) 294 attributes to Pheidias the invention of the colossal chryselephantine image. Lapatin (2001) 6 and chapter 4 agrees that there is no evidence for an over life-size chryselephantine statue before the time of Pheidias. The technique of the 'golden' (Kallimachos, Aitia, III, line 6) cult statue of Apollo from Delos, made by Tektaios and Angelion and dating from the mid-sixth century BC (for which see Overbeck (1868) nos. 334ff. and Fehr (1979) 72ff. and notes) is not known for certain but it was probably not chryselephantine. It is thought to have been constructed of wood covered in thin plates of hammered gold. It showed the god naked apart from a belt at his waist. Pausanias, II.32.5 and IX.35.3, and Plutarch, De Mus., 14, mention the statue but they do not refer to its material. References to other large, golden statues of the Archaic period, include the images of Apollo from Thornax and from Amyklai in Laconia (Herodotus, 1.69; Pausanias, III. 10.8; Athenaios,</page><page sequence="61">ATHENA AREIA 41 that he mentions the statue more because of his local patriotism than because the statue was admired in Roman times.106 Pheidias's statue at Plataia is perhaps better understood when considered in the light of local traditions.107 Pausanias's description of Pheidias's Plataian Çóavov comes after his description of the temple of Hera at Plataia - Hera was the principal deity of the place - and after a lengthy explanation of an important local festival of Hera, which involved the making of large wooden £oava - which were called 'daidala' - out of oak trees. These were dressed as brides and then taken up Mount Cithaeron on an ox-drawn wagon and burnt on a carefully constructed wooden altar.108 As Harrison says, this old custom points to a long tradition of wood-working in the area, and no doubt Pheidias found skilled wood-carvers to help him make the core of his Athena Areia.

ATTRIBUTIONS Apart from the fact that the Athena Areia was acrolithic and built on a very large scale, no hint as to its appearance is given in the sources. A popular identification is with the Athena Medici type, on the grounds of its technique, size and style.109 Höcker and Schneider, for instance, argue that the Medici type must go back to an acrolithic original, since arms, torso and head were all made out of separate blocks of stone. At least six of the existing replica fragments were made using the acrolithic or piecing technique, a fact which seems to support this idea. Most of the copies of the Medici type would have measured about 3m in height. Höcker and Schneider think this is a likely size for the Athena Areia. They date the Medici type to about the mid-fifth century BC on the grounds of the drapery style. The peplos is regarded as quite severe, but a new artistic step is thought to have been taken with the depiction of the chiton beneath: the thin, closely pleated chiton delicately reveals the relaxed right leg where the knee pushes open the belted peplos. Höcker and Schneider's arguments for identifying the Medici type with the Plataian statue do not seem compelling. Being akin to the Athena Parthenos and close to the style of the Parthenon sculptures, especially that of the pediments, the type is generally dated to the 430s BC.110 Strocka, on the other hand, updates the type to the Early Classical period, placing it around 460 BC.111 The Plataian statue may well have been made considerably later than 479 BC but, nevertheless, the Medici type is probably too late. There seems to be no good reason for accepting that the Athena Areia measured as little as 3m in height, even if it is plausible to think that this was the height of the original of the Athena Medici. If Pausanias is to be believed, the statue must have been substantially larger than this to come anywhere near to the size of Pheidias's great bronze Athena, with which Pausanias compares it. Becatti argued that since the Medici type appears on Athenian coins112 and not on Plataian coins, it is likely that the original was made for Athens rather than Plataia. This argument is supported by the existence of an Athenian votive relief, Akropolis 2426, bearing an image of the same type (Fig. 16.5). Linfert has suggested the Athena torso in Madrid as a replica of the Athena Areia (Fig. 4.1).113 The Early Classical date of the original of this sculpture and the supposition that the goddess once held weapons would suit such an attribution, as would certain Pheidian features of the drapery style, such as the delicate folds of the chiton sleeves, which are reminiscent of some of the Parthenon pedimental sculptures and the thick folds of the peplos, which call to mind the standing figure in north metope 32. Despinis, however, thinks that several details of the Madrid torso suggest that the statue imitates a bronze original.114 He also disagrees with Linfert that the right hand of the Madrid statue originally held a spear which rested on the ground. He argues that the movement of the 109 Höcker and Schneider (1993) 54-57. 110 See, for instance, Becatti (1951) 176ff. 111 Strocka (2004) 215-17. 112 Becatti (1951) pl. 86. 113 Linfert (1982) 71.

For these reasons, he associates the Athena in question with the Marathon Monument at Delphi and interprets her gesture as that of crowning Miltiades.1 15 4.3.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE The Athena Lemnia of Pheidias is mentioned by name in three sources, all dating from around the mid-second century AD: Aristides, Or. 34.28; Lucian, Imag . 4-6; and Pausanias, 1.28.2, lOff. Aristides lists the Athena Lemnia amongst the most praiseworthy and admired of the works of Pheidias. He includes it after the Zeus at Olympia, the Athena Parthenos - both chryselephantine works - and the great bronze Athena 'Promachos'. It is sometimes thought that, because he calls the Lemnia by its name, this implies that it too was made of bronze, and therefore needed a title to distinguish it from the famous statue Aristides calls TTļv as the 'Promachos' was simply known in antiquity. This inference may not be justified, however, for the use of the name Lemnia here could equally well distinguish the statue from the other chryselephantine statues just mentioned, if it turned out to be made in this technique. In his dialogue, Imagines , Lucian flatteringly builds up the portrait of Panthea, the courtesan from Smyrna who was the favourite of the Emperor Lucius Verus, by comparing her with famous works of art. The statues of Pheidias most highly praised by the writer were the Athena Lemnia and the Amazon. Putting the words into the mouths of a certain Lykinos, he says he would make the portrait using the outline of the face, the delicate cheeks, and the well-proportioned nose of the Lemnia, and the lips and neck of the Amazon. Lucian draws the reader's attention not only to the great beauty of the work, but also to the fact that the work was signed by Pheidias. The outstanding beauty of the Athena Lemnia is confirmed again by Pausanias, who describes the statue as the most worth seeing of Pheidias 's works. From Pausanias 's brief account, one can add a few further details. He says that the statue was on the Akropolis at Athens, that it was a votive offering and that it was named after the people who had dedicated it. According to Stevens, this statue and the portrait of Perikles, mentioned with it in the same passage, were probably situated near the north-east corner of the east front of the Propylaia.1 16 He bases this idea on the fact that they were the last works to be seen by Pausanias on his way out of the Akropolis before he passed through the small north door of the Propylaia. Harrison draws attention to the fact that there is no firm evidence to prove that the statue stood out in the open; it could equally well have stood within the east porch of the Propylaia.117 Since foreign dedications did not apparently exist on the Athenian Akropolis in the 5th century BC, Preller took Pausanias to mean that the dedicators of the 116 Stevens (1936) 514-15, frontispiece and figs. 7 and 62-63. 117 Harrison (1996) 54. 45</page><page sequence="65">46 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Athena Lemnia were not Lemnians but rather Athenian cleruchs on Lemnos.118 A suitable occasion for the offering of the statue was thought to be the departure from Athens of a group of Athenian citizens in around 451-448 BC to organize Lemnos as an Athenian cleruchy, an event for which there seems to be some reliable evidence.119 A cleruchy differed from a colony in that the settlers retained their original citizenship. They were, therefore, liable to pay war-tax and to do military service, and they continued to participate in Athenian religious festivals. It was customary for cleruchs to make a gift before departing from Athens, so the date of the cleruchy might provide an approximate terminus post quern of around 450 BC for the statue. The statue could, however, date from considerably later than this, for there may have been some lapse in time between the commissioning of the statue and its execution.120 The strength of the outside evidence for the founding of the cleruchy on Lemnos around 450 BC remains a matter of debate. Steinhart strongly doubts that the statue was dedicated by Athenian cleruchs setting out for Lemnos.121 According to Herodotus, Lemnos was conquered by Miltiades, the son of Kimon, in the late 6th century BC and this resulted in a population change.122 Steinhart points to the discovery of inscriptions in Attic lettering from the early 5th century BC as proof that Attic settlers were already living on the island from this period.123 The island later became a reliable and peaceful member of the Athenian empire. According to Steinhart, it is probable that the Athena Lemnia was simply a dedication made by Attic inhabitants of Lemnos. This theory weakens the argument for a mid- fifth century date for the Lemnia. It also has implications for the interpretation of the iconography of the statue, which is discussed in the following section. Apart from these secure references, certain other sources are sometimes linked with the Athena Lemnia. Firstly, there is Pliny, NH 34.54. In his list of bronze works by Pheidias he mentions a Minerva statue which he describes as being of such outstanding beauty that it apparently received the cognomen forma. This is often taken to be a reference to the Athena Lemnia, for the work was renowned for its great beauty and it is possible that it was made of bronze. Pliny does not name the statue, however, nor does any other text confirm that this Athena was popularly called forma , that is, 'the beauty'. A more difficult passage to interpret is one by Himerios, Or. 68.24. One should begin by noting that Himerios is a late source, dating from the 4th century AD, that his allusions are usually made for rhetorical effect and that his knowledge of the history of Classical art was not always very precise.124 In the passage in question Himerios states that Pheidias's skill was not limited to fashioning statues of Zeus or making bronzes of the armed Athena: not only did he make other gods but he also created a beautiful Athena who was unarmed, and he adorned her face with a blush so that it was this rather than a helmet which hid her 118 Preller (1846) 264. 119 See Hartswick (1983) 343 and Graham (1964) 178-92. 120 Harrison (1996) 58. 121 Steinhart (2000) 377-85. 122 Herodotus, VI. 140. 123 Steinhart (2000) 381, nn. 16-17. 124 See, for instance, Himerios, Or. 64.43 and notes.</page><page sequence="66">ATHENA LEMNIA 47 beauty. The implication that this Athena was made of bronze, coupled with the fact that the goddess was represented as very beautiful, has been interpreted by many as another reference to the Athena Lemnia. If this is correct, then Himerios's words add a new element to what is known about the Athena Lemnia: the goddess was not carrying weapons or wearing a helmet. The comment about the maidenly blush of the goddess may not be very informative.125 Whether or not Himerios's words in this passage apply to the Athena Lemnia, it is clear that they do not say that the goddess was holding her helmet in one hand, as Furtwängler has suggested.126 Although possibly correct, this idea is not backed by any of the literary sources. There are, however, good reasons for believing that such a type as Furtwängler reconstructed, the Dresden/Bologna type, did exist in Athens from at least the third quarter of the 5th century BC even if it is not necessarily the Athena Lemnia.127 The evidence from vase painting is difficult to interpret. It seems that the type of Athena holding her helmet in one hand was very common in the early Classical period, dying out soon after the mid-fifth century BC, after which time it recurred only occasionally.128 Kunisch has done a survey of the vases showing Athena holding her helmet and he shows that the motif occurs in many varied scenes.129 Sometimes, the helmet in the hand can be interpreted as a symbol of Athena's talent or her gift of strength in battle, as in scenes of the Judgement of Paris,130 sometimes it could be a sign that she is arming or disarming, or that she is 125 Hartswick (1983) 344. 126 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 3^5. 127 Palagia (1987) 81. For a full description and discussion of the Dresden/Bologna type, see Athena Lemnia, section 2. 128 See, for instance, the Nolan amphora attributed to the Berlin Painter, dating from around 480 BC. Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, 1913.133. Ridgway (1992) 141. Concerning this vase, Neils (1992b) 153, cat. no. 15, comments, "Perhaps because of the space constraints of the Nolan amphora, Athena has doffed her high-crested helmet and holds it forth in her right hand." 129 Kunisch (1974) 85-154. Some of the scenes in which Athena is shown holding her helmet include the following: Basel, Antikenmuseum, BS 434, the judgement of Paris; Tarquinia, 6848, Athena in the presence of Zeus, Ganymedes and Hermes; Stockholm, Medelhavsmus., 1963.1, Diomedes carrying off the Palladion; Athens, Akropolis Museum, 166, Athena seated in a pottery and metallurgy workshop; Ferrara, 3031 (T.579), Athena seated with heroes, including Herakles and Theseus. 130 Examples of vases where Athena is shown holding her helmet in a scene depicting the Judgement of Paris include the following: Basel, Antikenmuseum, BS 434, Attic black-figure hydria (Beazley, AB V, 268, 32; LIMC II, Athena, 975, no. 194); Ex-Berlin, Staatl.

It may indicate the peaceful spirit in which she comes. But in many cases the significance of the motif is not entirely clear and it seems that Kunisch is probably right to suggest that it was dictated on occasion simply by the rules of isocephalism in order to ensure that Athena was not depicted smaller than other figures. In another passage, Or. 28.39, Himerios refers to a statue of Athena on the Athenian Akropolis which was smaller in size than the Athena Parthenos and which was started while the Parthenos was in progress. Since it is known from the sources that there were at least three statues of Athena by Pheidias on the Akropolis, and it is also a fact that the Parthenos and the 'Promachos' were colossal works, it has been inferred by some that this 'little Parthenos' mentioned by Himerios is the Athena Lemnia.131 If one could be sure that this passage of Himerios was a reference to the Lemnia, then one would have further support for the proposed date of around 450 BC or a little later for the creation of this statue, for it is a well established fact that the Athena Parthenos dates from 447-438 BC. Himerios says that Pheidias was asked to make the 'smaller Parthenos' by Perikles, but Pheidias soon felt hampered in his efforts because of the smallness of the piece. So Perikles asked him to make it as well as he could, and then to concentrate on the larger work. Becatti has argued that this reference alludes not to the Athena Lemnia but to yet another Athena statue by Pheidias on the Akropolis, which he identifies with the Athena Medici type.132 The implied criticism in the Himerios passage about the 'little Parthenos' would not seem to suit a work such as the Athena Lemnia which, by all accounts, was one of Pheidias's most beautiful statues. In addition, if as Himerios says the 'smaller Parthenos' was made at the request of Perikles, then the connection with Lemnos is removed. Lapatin, however, argues that Becatti 's reading of this passage of Himerios is misleading and that, on the contrary, the 'smaller Parthenos' may well refer to the Lemnia.133 Writing from the perspective of a great many centuries after the time of Pheidias, Himerios may simply be alluding to the two most well known facts about Pheidias, without any knowledge of the details of his work: his association with Perikles and his reputation for colossal chryselephantine works. There are three epigrams which may refer to the Athena Lemnia, although this is not at all certain. Hermodoros, Anth. Plan. 170, probably writing in the 2nd century BC, compares the Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles with a statue of Athena in Athens. The Aphrodite was universally admired as one of the most stunning statues of Classical Greece, so the compliment made to the Athena is very great. Many scholars have assumed that the Athena statue in question must be the Lemnia, since this work is so often praised for its beauty. The problem is that the only characterization of the statue type is in the adjective 8opu0apaea, which may be more appropriate to an armed Athena and, as noted earlier, it 1771, bell krater {ARV2, 1318; LIMC VII, 181, no. 51; Arafat (1990) chapter 6, no. 6.7); New York, MMA 1906.1021.223, lekythos {LIMC VII, 181, no. 59); Paris, Louvre, N 3148, lekythos {LIMC VII, 181, no. 57); Athens, NM 12 545 {ARV2, 1457.1 1; LIMC VII, 181, no. 54). 131 For the three statues of Athena by Pheidias on the Akropolis see Pausanias, 1.24.5, for the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon and 1.28.2 for the 'Promachos' and the Lemnia. For the view that the ' little Parthenos' refers to the Lemnia, see Frickenhaus (1913) 349, and Klein (1915) 18. 132 Becatti (1951) 175-84. 133 Lapatin (2001) 199.</page><page sequence="68">ATHENA LEMNIA 49 is possible, though not yet proven, that the Athena Lemnia was not armed. The same theme - which may be a partial reference to the judgement of Paris myth - is found again in the anonymous, Anth. Plan . 169, also dating from the Hellenistic period. The references to the statues are even more vague here: Aphrodite is merely called ' A^poyevouç ūdeļu T1Ç, as opposed to Kviôíav KuGepeiav (Epigram 170), and Athena is merely described as' AT0i8a. Then there is an anonymous Hellenistic epigram from Paphos, IGB 529, that was found inscribed on a statue base. Several details are given about the Athena in question. She was weaponless and she held a Nike and, possibly, a staff. She was evidently a copy of an Attic work by Pheidias. In the words given her, she says she is 'coming to Kupris', that is, to Aphrodite. Because the goddess is said to be weaponless, it has been assumed by several scholars that the Lemnia is the only Athena statue by Pheidias which could be meant, since the others were armed. Other scholars doubt the validity of such an assumption and consider that this poem in fact refers to the Athena Parthenos.134 Linfert has suggested that the Athena statue destroyed in Constantinople in the early 13th century AD may have been the Athena Lemnia.135 The statue is described by Niketas Choniates, De Isaac. 738B. The more usual view is that the Constantinople statue was the Athena 'Promachos', but Linfert makes his claim for three main reasons. He says that the Athena 'Promachos' would have been too large to stand on any sort of pillar, as seems to have been the case for the statue described. The statue in Constantinople is further described as having made an odd, beckoning gesture towards the south with one hand and it was this, according to Niketas, which prompted the rioters to destroy the work since the gesture was interpreted as a sign of support for the enemies attacking the city at that time. Linfert thinks that this hand movement could well be explained by the fact that originally the hand held the goddess's helmet but, with the passage of time, the statue had been altered so that, by Niketas 's day, the hand was empty and the helmet was on the head. According to Linfert, this would also explain the peculiar hairstyle, with locks escaping from beneath the helmet here and there. Linfert further connects the words of Niketas with passages by Kedrenos and Arethas in a note on Aristides, saying that the description of the Athena as 'Lindian' is merely a misunderstanding - on the part of the author or the copyist - of the correct title 'Lemnian'.136 Here, one should simply note that there are problems attached to linking together the passages by Niketas, Kedrenos and Arethas: it is not clear that they are all describing the same statue. In addition, Linfert's theory of the change of name from 'Lemnian' to 'Lindian' is not convincing. For there was a sanctuary of Athena at Lindos on Rhodes. Kedrenos states that there were two statues standing on either side of the entrance to the Senate House of the Forum of Constantine: a Lindian Athena on the western side and an Amphitrite on the eastern side which, he adds, was also brought from Rhodes. This last comment, as Frantz points out, would not make sense unless Kedrenos intended to say that the Athena came from Rhodes too.137 Frantz dismisses the Lindian 134 See IGB 529 and notes, in Volume 2. 135 Linfert (1982) 59-66. 136 Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.565; scholion Aristides, Or. 34.28. These sources are discussed more fully in the chapter on the Athena 'Promachos', section 3. 137 Frantz (1988) 77.</page><page sequence="69">50 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS origin given by Kedrenos to this statue as "sheer absent-mindedness or else confusion among a number of notes" on the part of Kedrenos, on the grounds that Kedrenos had mentioned an Athena from Lindos only one page earlier.138 There he stated that the Lindian Athena was a small statue of green stone that had once stood in the Palace of Lausos and which had originally been a gift from an Egyptian ruler to Kleoboulos, tyrant of Lindos. Later in his work, Kedrenos says that the Egyptian statue had been destroyed in the fire which gutted the Lauseion in 475 AD. Frantz's comment concerning the use of icai avTJ] in his phrase fjxÖTl Kal avrr' aTrò'Póòou probably does disprove Linfert's suggestion.139 Frantz's explanation, however, for the author's supposed mistake is probably incorrect and, further, it is yet to be proved that Kedrenos is in fact mistaken here. For Frantz does not take into consideration another source on this matter, namely Konstantinos Rhodios, Ekphrasis , 153-162, who also talks of a bronze Athena Lindia in the Forum of Constantine. A more likely explanation for Kedrenos' s statement concerning the provenance of the statue is that he was drawing his information from Konstantinos. As to whether or not the statement is correct, the question remains unanswered. 5.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The usual type identified as the Athena Lemnia was reconstructed in the 1 9th century by Furtwängler from the following works: two very similar torsos in Dresden, both of which came from Rome in the late 1 8th century, and which depict a standing Athena, wearing a peplos and transverse aegis, and a head in Bologna, from the Palagi collection, with short wavy hair parted in the centre and bound by a fillet (Figs. 5. 1-2). 140 Puchstein had already associated the Dresden replicas with the Athena Lemnia.141 Furtwängler showed that the Palagi head was a superior copy of the same type as the head surviving on the Dresden torso, no. 49. His identification of the type was based on the evidence from the literary sources, coupled with that of the so-called Cades gem and at least five similar gems (Fig. 5.4 shows London, British Museum 1372). The statue type, as shown in Dresden no. 49, is a standing Athena wearing her aegis diagonally. The goddess wears a peplos, open along the right side, and she has a rope tied round the waist on top of both peplos and aegis. She stands resting on her right leg with the left slightly drawn back and outwards. The left arm is raised and creates a straight line from the shoulder. The top of the right arm is held down by her side. The head is turned to her right and tilted slightly downwards. Furtwängler reconstructed the left arm holding a spear and, from the evidence supplied by at least one 1st century BC gem,142 he suggested that the right hand was extended and held the goddess's helmet. Weber is of the opinion that the best available replica of the torso is the Kassel torso, which is modelled in much 138 Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.564. 139 Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.616. 140 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 3-45. For the Palagi head, see Palagia (1987) 82, flg. 1 . 141 Puchstein (1890) 94-95, figs. 5a, 6a. 142 Palagia (1987) 81 and n. 2.</page><page sequence="70">ATHENA LEMMA 51 greater detail than the other copies and is therefore thought to be closer to the Classical original.143 The head of the Gorgon on the aegis has snake-like hair, the aegis has freely rendered 'scales' and the seam of the peplos is indicated by a fine, incised line. The Bologna head turns to the right. The hair is relatively short, divided by a curved parting running from crown to forehead, and is bound with a plain, wide fillet. The hair is combed back over the ears with the long ends tucked under the band. A bunch of hair at the nape is combed upward with the ends bound by the fillet. The eye sockets are widely spaced. The upper eyelids alone are carved and they are sharply set off from the emphatic brows. The nose is large and straight, and projects from the profile of the forehead. An incised depression shaped like a tear-drop marks the area between the nose and lips. The mouth is small, the lips pursed. The corners have been emphasized by the drill. The chin is rounded and firm. The planes of the face subtly merge together so that the surface is smooth and full of gentle curves. This contrasts with the sharply incised hair. The Bologna head is considered to be the best replica of the head, clearly demonstrating its dependence on a bronze original. The bust type, however, is Roman Imperial. The Kassel torso and Dresden no. 49, on the other hand, were probably made in the same piece of marble as their respective heads and did not have separately inserted busts. In passing, it should be noted that Weber compares the Bologna head with those of the Ephesian Amazons and concludes that it is closest to the so-called Sosikles Amazon whose hair is rendered in a freer fashion than that of the Sciarra and Mattei types, who have more neatly organized tresses. It is partly for this reason that Weber attributes the Sosikles Amazon to Pheidias. Hartswick has argued that the connection between the Dresden torso and the Bologna head cannot be proved, that the head differs entirely from mid-fifth century BC head types and is probably a classicizing Roman work, that the gems used by Furtwängler to support his reconstruction are all fakes, and that while the Dresden body type is probably mid-fifth century BC, there is nothing to link it with the Pheidian Lemnia.144 Protzmann, on the other hand, shows that there are clear grounds for thinking that the Dresden and Bologna heads are close replicas, and that the Dresden head is made of identical marble to that of the Dresden torso, so that the two parts must surely belong together.145 Weber has also defended Furtwängler's identification of the Dresden/Bologna type by emphasizing that the head and torso of Dresden no. 49 definitely belong together, as there is a good fit where the head joins the body and, in addition, the Dresden head agrees very closely in its measurements with the Bologna head.146 Weber also points out that the gems depicting this type of statue existed before Furtwängler suggested his reconstruction. Palagia disputes Hartswick' s claim that the gems are fakes and she goes on to show that even if there is no proof that Furtwängler's reconstruction is the Lemnia, there is evidence to suggest that it did exist as a 5th century BC statue type in Athens, at least as early as the third quarter of the century if not before.147 Palagia points to the 5th century BC statuette from the Athenian Akropolis, no. 1337, and the 4th century BC votive relief from 143 Weber (1991) 56. 144 Hartswick (1983) 335ff. Cf. Meyer (1997) 112. 145 Protzmann (1987) 7ff. 146 Weber (1991) 56-64. 147 Palagia (1987) 81.</page><page sequence="71">52 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEEDIAS Epidauros which shows a related figure (Fig. 5.3). Concerning the date, Weber makes comparisons with the sculptures of the Parthenon and finds a close parallel for the Kassel replica in a woman wearing a peplos on north metope no. 32. 148 Despite the differences in material and type, for the metope is of course a marble relief executed on a much smaller scale, the rendering of the folds is very similar in both cases. Weber sees this as an indication of a date of about 450 BC for the Athena Lemnia. The importance of the helmet as an integral part of the composition is commented upon by Weber. She sees the helmet as that of a stratēģos and points out that, in this capacity, Perikles is known to have supported several cleruchies. If this interpretation is correct, then the helmet takes on an important significance for this particular dedication. Steinhart agrees about the importance of the helmet in this composition but, as he is sceptical about the evidence for the founding of a cleruchy in the mid-fifth century BC, he is of the opinion that the significance of the helmet is better understood in terms of the cultural and religious traditions of Lemnos.149 The island of Lemnos was closely connected with the god Hephaistos. He was supposed to have landed there when he fell from Olympos. The main city of the island was called Hephaistia in the god's honour and the image of the god's head appeared on Lemnian coins. The island was famous for its forges and bronzework, in particular for the production of weapons. The lance and the helmet which the Athena Lemnia might have carried can be seen, according to Steinhart, as giving this representation of Athena a particularly Lemnian flavour. The choice of a Corinthian helmet is significant because these were technically very damanding to produce. Steinhart also draws attention to the fact that Athena was the goddess of handicrafts and she was often connected with Hephaistos, god of the forge.150 Boardman gives Furtwängler's reconstruction "the benefit of the doubt" but he cites Barron as claiming that it belongs to Pheidias's group at Delphi.151 Harrison rejects Furtwängler's identification of the Dresden/Bologna type as the Athena Lemnia.152 She is of the opinion that the Bologna head is too thin to match the description of the Lemnia' s face given by Lucian.153 She suggests that, as the three secure references to the statue all date from about the same period (late Antonine and early Seveřan), the standard of beauty used to judge the work must also date from that time, and in those days a rounder face was apparently in fashion. This is further supported, she claims, by a late Antonine/early Seveřan relief of Athena on Lemnos. From her reading of the sources, Harrison also 148 Berger (1986) pls. 34-35. Note Linferťs comparison, commented on page 37 above, of the drapery of the Madrid Athena torso with the thick peplos folds on Parthenon north metope 32, to suggest that the Madrid Athena reflects a Pheidian work (Linfert (1982) 71). 149 Steinhart (2000) 382-85. 150 The Hephaisteion at Athens had cult statues to the two gods, for example. See Camp (1990) 39ff. 151 Boardman (1985a) 204 and also 84. For the Delphi group, see Pausanias, X.10.1. 152 Harrison (1988) 101-07. 153 Lucian, Imag. 4-6.</page><page sequence="72">ATHENA LEMNIA 53 suspects that the Athena Lemnia was rather larger than was the original of the Dresden/Bologna type.154 Instead, Harrison proposes the Athena Medici as a copy of the Athena Lemnia, following Amelung.155 This attribution is supported by Neils.156 According to this view, the Lemnia was represented as a warrior making a libation before departure. She held a shield and spear in her left hand, while her right held a libation dish. This type is known in a number of copies. It closely resembles the image to be seen on numerous Athenian coins, suggesting that the original was well known and significant in Athens.157 Harrison thinks that the original of this type was an acrolith, a technique much admired in the Antonine period.158 She suggests that the technique is indirectly alluded to in the ancient sources, where the statue is referred to at least twice, by Pliny and Aristides, side by side with the great chryselephantine colossi of Pheidias. Harrison argues that the dress and pose of the Medici type echo those of warriors leaving home, as seen on vase paintings, an image which would be highly suitable for Athenians departing to found a cleruchy in Lemnos.159 The advanced right foot and the gentle turn of the head in that direction hint at departure, while the doubled mantle draped over the left shoulder - in the manner of a soldier already on the march - suggests the journey about to be undertaken.160 Harrison has also found evidence in reliefs from Ostia, now in Berlin and Ostia, to support her argument.161 The reliefs show episodes in the life of Hephaistos, the chief divinity of Lemnos.162 Twice Athena is shown holding a shield and spear on her left side, like the Medici type, while touching an olive tree with her right hand. The Medici type is found represented next to an olive tree on a votive relief from Athens, which is also of Roman date.163 One of the episodes in the story of Hephaistos in which Athena is important is the time when Athena came to ask Hephaistos to make some weapons for her during the Trojan War: she aroused his desire and some of his seed fell on her leg. In disgust, she wiped her leg with a piece of wool which she then threw to the ground. From this was born Erichthonios, a name which seems to join e pi, wool, and earth. The thinly draped right leg, provocatively appearing between the folds of the peplos of the Athena Medici, one of the hallmarks of the Medici type, might plausibly be read as an allusion to this 154 Harrison (1996) 53 and n. 173. 155 Amelung (1908) 195f. 156 Neils (1992b) 185 no. 59. 157 Becatti (1951) 175-84, pl. 86, nos. 258, 259, 260, 263, 267. 158 Harrison (1996) 54. 159 Harrison (1988) 105-07, pl. 30, 4. 160 So Harrison (1996) 58. 161 Berlin, SK 912 and 913, and Ostia, inv. 148 and 18853. 162 When Hephaistos was thrown out of Olympos by Zeus, he landed on Lemnos, Iliad, I. 590-94. 163 Akropolis, inv. 2426, cat. no.

The story is recorded by Apollodoros, but whether it was familiar in this form in the 5th century BC is not known, a point Harrison makes.164 If the Medici type reflects the Athena Lemnia, then the date of the work becomes an important issue. The presumed date of the founding of the Athenian cleruchy in Lemnos is around 450 BC, and stylistic considerations lead many scholars to the conclusion that the Medici type is close to the style of the Parthenon pediments and its original is probably to be dated in the later 430s BC, when Pheidias had left Athens for Olympia. Harrison bypasses these difficulties by suggesting that there must have been a substantial time lapse between the commissioning of the statue and its construction, and that, while Pheidias furnished the design of the Lemnia, its execution was left in the hands of Agorakritos.165 Without further evidence, these theories remain very tentative. While the iconography of the Medici type might support identification with the Lemnia, such an identification seems to entail the dismissal of much of the evidence from the written sources. Harrison is surely correct to point out that much of what has traditionally been extrapolated from the sources concerning the date, the iconography, and the material of the Lemnia is questionable. Nevertheless, it would be desirable to have some confirmation from the sources that this identification is justifiable. Another scholar who rejects Furtwängler's identification of the Dresden/Bologna type as the Athena Lemnia is Meyer.166 He agrees with Hartswick that the gems showing Furtwängler's Lemnia are probably 18th century fakes, modelled on Dresden torso 49 and the Dresden replica of the Palagi head. He is not convinced that the head and torso types in question go together, for he thinks the head is too small for the torso. Instead, he suggests that the Athena in a cross-band aegis, best known in the Berlin Athena statue, may reflect the Athena Lemnia of Pheidias.167 This Athena is generally regarded as a Hellenistic creation, with its restless drapery and unusual, narrow aegis that forms a striking cross over the upper torso.168 But Meyer argues that the discovery of the same type of Athena on an Attic relief in Fier Museum, Albania, proves that the type must go back to around 430 BC.169 This Athena is represented standing with her weight on her right leg, the left leg relaxed and set well to the side. She wears a peplos, which is bound at the waist and has a long overfall, and a narrow, cross-band aegis. Her left arm is bent at the elbow and she carries a round shield. Her right arm hangs down and in this hand she is holding a Corinthian helmet. Her neck bends to the right, her head is covered in a thick mass of hair which appears to be tied up, and there is no hair on the neck or shoulders. In Meyer's opinion, the slightly odd appearance of the Berlin Athena is probably due to the fact that it has the wrong head type, one which is in any case too large for the torso. But Meyer compares the virile body with that of the Hermes Ludovisi and the similarities between 164 Harrison (1996) 58, n. 196. 165 Apollodoros, III.14.6. Harrison (1996) 58-59. 166 Meyer (1997) 111-117. 167 Meyer (1997) fig. 63. 168 Ridgway (1970) 130; Mielsch (1995) 776; Boardman (1985a) fig. 199. 169 Meyer (1997) 112-13, fig. 62.</page><page sequence="74">ATHENA LEMNIA 55 these two works strengthen, in his view, a link with Pheidias. The same type is found again on a red-figure krater dating from about 410 BC. 170 In this case it was used for a depiction of Nike. The existence of an Attic relief showing a cross-band aegis Athena type perhaps suggests that a famous statue of this type stood in Athens in the 430s BC. The fact that a copy, even if not a very faithful one, was set up in Pergamon makes it probable that the work was of some importance. Whether one can go any further in support of Meyer's theory remains questionable, though it will be interesting to see if further copies of this type come to light, as he expects. 5.3. CATALOGUE 1. DRESDEN STATUE 49 (Fig. 5.1) Dresden, Museum, cat. no. 49. Statue. H. 1.977m (without the plinth). MH: 2.067m. Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 117-138. The head and torso have been joined at the neck. The head was wrongly restored with a Corinthian helmet to conceal the missing crown. The nose, chin and the top of the head have now been restored and the helmet removed. There is a crack along the hair parting, above the forehead and taenia. A modern cut in the middle of both the upper arms marks the end of the arms. The dress is well preserved, with only a few chips here and there. There is some restoration of the dress and the rim of the aegis. The statue was acquired in Rome by August the Strong in 1728. It was originally thought to have come from the Chigi Collection, but it is perhaps from the Albani Collection. The statue represents an over life-size, standing Athena wearing her aegis diagonally. The body type is known in numerous copies, but this particular example is important in that it is the only one which provides a positive link with the Palagi head in Bologna, of the original of which this statue's head is a further copy. The head was made in one piece with the torso. It is turned to the figure's right and faces slightly downwards. The crown of the head is missing. The hair, which is parted in the middle, frames the forehead and the sides of the head in a curly and voluminous mass, but leaves the ears almost completely exposed. At the nape the hair is brought up in a small bun. The arrangement of the hair, including the low relief curls in front of the ears and on the neck, follows the scheme of the Bologna head, though it is generally less detailed. The handsome, oval face narrows towards the chin. The goddess has a fine, long nose, almond-shaped eyes beneath straight brows, and a full, rounded mouth, with closed lips that turn down slightly at the corners. The features are less delicate than those of the Bologna head, though again resembling them fairly closely. The neck is fully exposed, and the chest is visible to the sternum. The goddess stands resting her weight on her right leg, while the left is set to the side and back. The left shoulder is set higher than the right and, while the right upper arm hangs down by the figure's side, the left is held out in a straight line from the shoulder. The goddess wears a thick peplos which is open on the right side and has a long overfold. Over this she wears a large, transverse aegis, adorned with a scaly pattern, plastically rendered snakes on the figure's right side, and a gorgoneion to the left of centre. The gorgon' s head 170 Meyer (1997) 117, fig. 66.</page><page sequence="75">56 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS is wide and squat but not monstrous. The lips are sealed and the hair, which is parted in the middle is organized in a wavy pattern. Over the peplos and the aegis is a belt, knotted in the middle at the front. She wears thick-soled sandals. The heavy fabric of the peplos is rendered by a few, unrevealing folds, which show little movement even over the relaxed left leg. Characteristic folds include the open V shape on the chest, the parallel zigzags of the peplos opening, and the uneven kolpoi, one at the belt on the right side and one set higher under the left arm where the aegis begins.

DRESDEN STATUE 50 Dresden, Museum, cat. no. 50. Statue. H. 1.80m. Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 117-138. This statue has lost its head and neck, the right breast and shoulder, all the right arm and most of the left arm, which is cut off from about the middle of the upper arm. The drapery is well preserved at the front, a little more battered on the folds at the back. The statue was acquired in Rome by August the Strong in 1728. Like the above statue, it was originally thought to have come from the Chigi Collection, but it is perhaps from the Albani Collection. This statue is almost identical with Dresden 49, but it was made using a different technique. For, while Dresden 49 was made in one piece, this statue has a cavity for the insertion of the head, neck, and chest, which would have been made separately. According to Furtwängler, the cavity for the bust is exactly the right size for the Palagi head. There is a small square hole, approximately 2cm by 2cm, in the plinth in front of the left leg. This is thought to have held the end of the spear which the goddess was probably holding upright in her raised left hand. Although Dresden 49 and 50 are very similar, small differences may be observed. For example, the folds of cloth on the edge of the peplos overfold are less level in this case. The features of the Gorgon on the aegis are more accentuated and her hair is wilder. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Canciani, F. (1984) 1084, no. 141. Furtwängler, A. (1895/1964) 4-5, pl. II. Gercke, P., ed.

KASSEL STATUE Kassel, Staatl. Kunstsmmlg., Sk2. Statue. H. 1.75m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown, possibly Rome. 1st or 2nd century AD. In 1973-1974 this statue was thoroughly restored and the modern additions, such as the head and the arms, the feet, the base, and parts of the drapery at the hem, the peplos opening and overfold, were removed. The right upper half of the back, which was broken, has been restored. Much of the aegis has been restored too. Many of the snakes of the aegis have been broken off or damaged. Many of the drapery folds are very chipped and there are whole sections of drapery missing on the right thigh, both at the front and at the back and, to a lesser extent, on the front of the left thigh. The headless torso is of the same type as the Dresden statues and the Albani and Museo Nuovo Capitolino torsos. Like Dresden 50, the head and neck were inserted into the torso. In this case, however, the cavity was not as large as to include the whole of the undraped area of the bust. The general scheme of the folds resembles the Dresden statues, with the parallel zigzags of the peplos opening, the open V fold at the neck and the kolpoi. The arrangement of the peplos overfold is very similar to Dresden 50. But the folds on the side of the right knee are treated differently from those of the Dresden statues: they are both flatter and more numerous. The scales of the aegis are rendered in higher relief. The Gorgon's head is also different; it is rounder, with the eyes half shut and the hair depicted as snaky locks twisting about in all directions without a central parting. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Bieber, M.

Statue. H. 2.02m. Marble. Perhaps found near the Via Appia. AD 117-138. The head is ancient but it does not belong to the statue. The join between the head and the torso is modern. It is inscribed on the kalathos with the names of the artists Kriton and Nikolaos of Athens. The back of the statue is only roughly worked, though it is fully designed. The nose, the front part of the right foot, three toes on the left foot, the left lower arm to the elbow, the right arm from the shoulder, a large part of the deer skin, many folds of the drapery and part of the plinth have all been restored. The statue was supposedly found on the Via Appia in 1766, along with a number of caryatids, but this is not certain. One of only three headless torsos of the same type as Dresden 49 and 50, this figure is rendered in mirror-image and wearing a deer skin instead of an aegis. On the shoulders and on the back can be seen large, wavy strands of hair. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Bol, R. (1990) 90-94, no. 178, pls. 46^19. Helbig, W. (1972) Vol. IV, 182-83, no. 3218. Schmidt-Colinet, A.

From Rome. 1st or 2nd century AD. The torso is preserved from just above the left breast to the middle of the left thigh. On the right side, it survives only from the middle of the right breast to just under the aegis. It is rather battered. The sculpture was found in the foundations of a building between the Via del Tritone and the Via degli Avignonesi in Rome, some time before 1909, when it was published in the Notizzie degli Scavi. This torso conforms to the type of Dresden 49 and 50. Like Dresden 50, the head and neck were inserted into a large cavity in the torso. In this case the lower part of the statue seems to have been made separately and attached too. Unlike the Dresden statues, this one has a gorgoneion of the so-called beautiful type, with small wings on her head. Another difference is in the arm positions, for the right arm may have been raised while the left seems to have hung down and away from the body. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Bieber, M. (1915) 6. Hartswick, K. J.

White, coarse-grained marble. From Corinth, near the Odeum. 1 st or 2nd century AD. The left breast and part of the aegis with the gorgoneion are preserved in one piece. Both the head and the arms were inserted separately. Other small fragments found in the same area may belong to the statue, for example, inv. No. 1330, the front part of a life-size foot wearing a sandal. The torso was found in 1930 in a pit dug to the south of the Odeum in the foundations of a large building which is thought to have been a stoa. The fragment comes from an approximately life-size Athena in peplos and diagonal aegis. The scales of the aegis are carefully rendered. At the upper edge is a serpent. The texture of the drapery is indicated by fine marks of the rasp, while the nude parts were highly polished. The torso fragment was connected by Broneer with the type seen in Dresden 49 and 50 but, according to Ridgway, the remains of the aegis prove that the aegis was much smaller than the type seen on the Dresden statues. She suggests that the torso should be compared rather with the bronze Athena from the Piraeus, of which only one copy is known, the so-called Mattei Athena. This work has been discussed by Waywell.

BOLOGNA HEAD (Fig. 5.2) Bologna, Museo Civico, G 1060. Head. H. 0.43m. Marble. Provenance unknown. 1st or 2nd century AD. The head is intact except for the eyes, which were inserted separately and are now lost. A blackish incrustation of oxides and dirt that covered the entire back and parts of the front of the head were removed in 1921, revealing a smooth, white surface. In 1976 the head was removed from the marble base into which it was embedded. It is now displayed tilting forwards. The head came into the possession of Pelagio Palagi, the artist and collector, in 1829 from the bothers Sanquirico. The Palagi Collection became part of the Bologna Museum in 1 860 and was published for the first time by E. Conze. The distinctive features of this fine head are the broad, flat fillet around the head and the hairstyle: parted down the centre, the wavy hair covers the skull, and then frames the forehead and the sides of the head in a more voluminous mass before being gathered in a small bun at the nape of the neck. The ears are not completely hidden by the hair. Little curls in very low relief appear to escape from the main mass of hair in front of the ears and somewhat behind the ears on the neck. The face is expressionless. Its long, oval shape narrows at the chin. The eye sockets are widely spaced. The upper lid alone is carved and sharply set off from the brow which is carved at a straight angle from the forehead. The eyes are long and almond-shaped. The nose is long and straight. A teardrop-shaped depression marks the area between the nose and the upper lip. The mouth is small and has full lips. The corners of the mouth are emphasized with the drill. The chin is slightly rounded but not wide. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Becatti, G. (1951) 253-54, pl. 85. Brizio, E. (1887) 24. Canciani, F. (1984) 1084, no. 141a. Conze, E. (1867) 87-96. Furtwängler, A.

OXFORD HEAD Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, 1919.67. Head. H. 0.38m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 1 st century AD. A well preserved head, with only the nose restored in plaster. The smoothness of the skin suggests that the head has been worked over. The details of the hair are rather worn. The head once belonged to Lord Downe, who bought it, probably in Rome, around 1 800. It remained in his possession at Cowick Hall, Yorkshire, until his death, when his widow removed it to her house in London. Thereafter it remained in the family until it was purchased for the Ashmolean in 1919 with the help of Sir John Evans. This head is of the same type as the Palagi head in Bologna, but it is of poorer workmanship than the Bologna example. The character of the type appears weakened here because the eyes are smaller and they are softly modelled, and the mouth is less firm and full.</page><page sequence="79">60 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS BIBLIOGRAPHY: Gardner, P.

The head and arms are missing, as well as most of the himation down the back. The statuette is chipped on the left knee and large areas of the back. Two holes in the belt at the front show where a bronze adornment was once attached. This is a small-scale copy of the same statuary type as that which probably inspired the Athena on the Epidauros relief, though the position of the arms is reversed. The prototype probably dated from the late third quarter of the 5th century BC, and it was perhaps influenced by the so-called Lemnia type of the mid-fifth century BC. The work is beautifully executed and shows many details. The goddess is represented standing with her weight on the right leg, the left slightly bent at the knee and set a little to the side. There is a slight rise in the right shoulder and breast, while the remains of the left shoulder show that this arm was lowered and held somewhat away from the body. Athena wears a belted peplos with a long overfold, brooches on the shoulders, and side kolpoi. She has a himation down the back and a very narrow diagonal aegis. Vertical folds cover the right leg until just above the foot, while the left leg is clearly modelled through the drapery. She also wears a necklace. The pose of the arms and the legs, the peplos and the diagonal aegis are all reminiscent of the type seen in Dresden 49 and 50, though this statuette is different in a number of ways. The aegis is very narrow and the gorgoneion is set between the breasts. A long bunch of wavy hair, which must have been tied at the neck, can be seen coming down at the back. The modelling of the left leg through the drapery shows a more advanced style than that exhibited in the Dresden statues. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Berger, E. (1967) 85, no. 7a. Beyer, I.

SOME INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ATHENA PARTHENOS (A) THE PROBLEM OF THE NAME OF THE STATUE The earliest known references to Pheidias's chryselephantine statue of Athena on the Athenian Akropolis date from the 5th and 4th centuries BC, and come mainly from official accounts documents from the Akropolis or, as in the case of Philochoros, in the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, from sources which draw on these documents. In these examples, the statue is not given a particular name. It is simply referred to as tò aya'|ia, to ëôoç or T) 0eóç, with sometimes a qualifying description stating the material, the location or the identity of the statue. These terms were commonly used to refer to cult statues worshipped within a temple, so their use in connection with the Athena Parthenos is significant.171 In the annual accounts of the statue, which must have been published shortly after the completion of the work in 438 BC, the prescript names the annual secretary to the board of epistatai overseeing the creation of 'the golden statue', ayaX|iaTÔ Xpuaô.172 In the Parthenon Treasures inventory lists, which were kept from at least as early as 434/433 BC to the end of the 4th century BC, the statue is regularly called tò ayaX|ia.173 From the inscriptions, as well as from other 5th and 4th century BC sources such as Aristotle, Isokrates, Thucydides, and Philochoros, one may observe that qualifying phrases include xpucroi)v, tò Lv toh ř EKCtTOļiTTeSak, or Tfļ 'AGrļva.174 This style of designation continued to be used by later authors too, as can be seen, for instance, from the use of the phrases tò xpucrow eòo and tò âyaX|ia by Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus.175 In similar vein, later sources sometimes allude to the fact that the statue was chryselephantine or simply describe the work as made of ivory.176 171 For a survey of the use of words to describe Greek statues, see Nick (2002) 12-28. 172 Statue building accounts, IG I3 453-460. See, for instance, IG I3 457, lines 4-5 (Year 442/441 BC). 173 See, for instance, IG II2 1407, lines 6-7; 1410, lines 7-8; 1443, lines 10-11; 1468, lines 6-8; 1477, lines 12-14. 174 Aristotle, Ath.

This title was used by the poet Philippides, in a passage preserved by Plutarch.177 Philippides deliberately uses the name 'Parthenos' to highlight the irreverence displayed by Demetrios Poliorketes when he came to Athens as its conqueror in 304 BC and was housed, along with his courtesans, in what Plutarch refers to as the opisthodomos of the Parthenon, tòv óttict0ó8o|iov toi) riapOevwoç.178 Possible 5th century BC references, rejected by most authorities, occur in Aristophanes.179 There are no other sources of this date to confirm that the name was in use as early as this and the passages in question make good sense even if the word 'parthenos' is taken in its usual sense. Nevertheless, one cannot rule out the possibility that Aristophanes was referring to Pheidias's statue. In later centuries Pheidias's chryselephantine Athena is regularly called 'Parthenos'.180 But in earlier sources this epithet is rarely used, a fact which has raised the question whether the statue had any name, other than Athena, when it was first made. Pliny, writing in the mid-first century AD, does not call the statue 'Parthenos'. In one passage he refers to the work as 'the ivory Athena in the Parthenon' and in another he simply calls it 'the Minerva in Athens'.181 That the title 'Parthenos' was already current by his day, however, is indicated by the anecdote he recounts in NH 22.44, concerning the medicinal plant shown by Athena to Perikles in a dream and called parthenium in the goddess's honour. Pausanias, writing in the mid-second century AD, talks of tx)v KaXouļievTļv riapöevov, 'the statue called the Parthenos', and elsewhere he specifies rf's Ka'ov' ±évx)s virò' AGrļvaicov riapOévou, 'the statue called Parthenos by the Athenians'.182 The use of a clear designating epithet in these two passages is understandable, for neither of them deals primarily with the Athena of the Parthenon and Pausanias needed to avoid possible confusion with other Athenas made by Pheidias. Pausanias 's expression in both the phrases quoted, however, makes it difficult to tell whether he meant that the epithet was a local cult title or merely a local nickname. In Greek literature the epithet 'Parthenos' is not specific to Athena but is applied equally to other maiden goddesses, such as Artemis. Homer never calls Athena 'Parthenos'. The first known use of the epithet in literature is in the 28th Homeric hymn to Athena, written by an Athenian. It is also found in Pindar, and later in Euripides.183 According to Herington, most classical references to Athena as 'Parthenos' are Athenian.184 Official titles of the goddess included Boulaia and Pronoia, for her planning and forethought; Kourotrophos 177 Plutarch, Dem. 26. 178 Plutarch, Dem. 23. 179 Aristophanes, Av. 670 and Thesmo. 1139. 180 See, for instance, Himerios, Or. 64.43, and Gregorios Nazianzenos, Carmina Mor alia , 742, writing in the 4th century AD, and the scholiasts' notes to Aristides ( Oratio 3.336, anathematon) and to Demosthenes ( Contra Androt. 13), which are probably later. 181 Pliny, NH 34.54 and NH 36.18. 182 Pausanias, V.l 1.10, and X.34.8. 183 Pindar, 12.7f.; Euripides, Troi. 971. 184 Herington (1955) 9.</page><page sequence="90">ATHENA PARTHENOS 7 1 and Hygieia, as foster-mother of the divine child; Polias and Promachos, as the guardian of the Akropolis and the city of Athens; Phratria and Apatouria, reflecting her ties with the ancient royal family; Ergane as goddess of crafts and weaving; Hippia as tamer of horses; and Nike, the giver of victory. The epithet 'Parthenos' clearly emphasized the fact that Athena was a virgin goddess and this quality was perhaps seen as part of the goddess's warlike attributes, for virginity was often associated with pugnacity and invincibility.185 Proof that Athena was popularly, if not officially, worshipped as 'Parthenos' on the Akropolis from at least the late 6th century BC is indicated from the existence of three votive inscriptions dedicated to the goddess.186 These were found on the Akropolis and they range in date from before 500 BC to around 460 BC. Lipka, who discusses these inscriptions along with the Hekatompedon inscription, IG I3 4, believes not only that they confirm the existence of a cult to Athena Parthenos on the Akropolis, but also that this cult was probably practised in the vicinity of the later Parthenon temple.187 Evidence of cult activity in the vicinity of the Parthenon has come to light in the form of traces of a small altar and a shrine within the north pteron of the Parthenon, which are thought to predate the Parthenon and, perhaps, to have influenced this temple's position.188 The shrine and altar were probably used for the worship of Athena, perhaps under the aspect of Athena Parthenos. While the name Athena 'Parthenos', designating Pheidias's statue, can be traced back to at least the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, if not earlier, the name 'Parthenon', as applied to the whole temple, can be traced back to about the mid- fourth century BC. Previously, it had been referred to simply as 'the neos'. Writing in the mid-fourth century BC, Demosthenes applies the name 'Parthenon' to the whole building, albeit in an unofficial way.189 Writing at about the same time, Lykourgos calls the temple the 'Hekatompedon'.190 In later authors, one can find further examples of the use of both of these names for the temple: 'Hekatompedon' is used several times by Plutarch, while 'Parthenon' can be found in Pausanias, Strabo, Himerios, Zosimos and Marinos.191 Plutarch even conflates the names, calling the temple €kqtÓ|j.u€8ov Fia p0e iwa. 192 'Hekatompedos neos' is also found in some sources.193 In the inventory lists of the temple treasures of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the name Parthenon is reserved for a treasure store which held, amongst other things, the bronze 185 Herington (1955) 11, and Ridgway (1992) 135. 186/GI3 728, 745 and 850. 187 Lipka (1997) 37^4.

The reason why the west chamber was given the name 'Parthenon' remains unclear, but if, as suggested above, the tradition of a cult of Athena Parthenos on the site of the Parthenon temple had existed from long before the existence of the mid-fifth century BC temple, then the possibility that the statue gave its name to the temple rather than vice versa becomes more likely. (B) THE FUNCTION OF THE ATHENA PARTHENOS It has often been claimed that the Athena Parthenos was not the object of religious worship, like the Athena Polias, but was viewed rather as the most valuable of Athenian treasures and perhaps as a victory monument. It is argued that the main festival of Athena, the Panathenaic Festival, was celebrated in honour of Athena Polias, and that it was for the ancient wooden xoanon of Athena Polias that an elaborate peplos was made each year and presented to this sacred image when the Panathenaic procession arrived at the temple on the north side of the Akropolis. Mansfield has made a careful examination of all the sources relating to the peplos of Athena.195 This study has revealed that, from some time in the 470s BC, more than one peplos was offered to the goddess. The traditional, human-sized peplos, which was made by Athenian women and young girls during the nine months that preceded the Panathenaic festival, continued to be offered annually to Athena Polias. In addition, however, it appears that every fourth year a second peplos was made, this time by a group of professional men. This peplos was as big as the sail of a real ship and it was used to adorn one of the ships from the battle of Salamis, which was put on wheels and pulled through the streets in procession at the Greater Panathenaia.196 What happened to this enormous and no doubt magnificent peplos once it reached the Akropolis is not known. But it seems reasonable to believe that it formed part of the offerings to the goddess and that it was put on display somewhere. Lewis suggested that from the 430s BC it was presented to the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon.197 Barber finds it difficult to believe that the Parthenos could have been robed in the sail-peplos, and proposes that it was hung up as a kind of ritual backdrop behind the Parthenos.198 But perhaps of some interest in this matter is the painting of Athena on the Baksy krater in St. Petersburg, a rare and early imitation of the Athena Parthenos, which is not intended to be an accurate copy but which undeniably refers to the work. This figure is draped in a richly adorned purple cloak.199 Mansfield also points to the existence of an offerings table in the Parthenon east chamber, which is referred to in 4th century BC inventories, as proof that the Athena Parthenos was at the centre of certain religious rituals.200 As stated in the 194 See, for example, IG II2 1407, lines 6-7. 195 Mansfield (1985). 196 See Plutarch, Dem. 10. 5, 12.3. 197 Lewis (1979-1980) 28-29. 198 Barber (1992) 114 and 209 n. 30. 199 The Baksy krater is discussed and illustrated by Shefton (1982) 149ff. and (1992) 241-51, pls. 53-56. 200 See Mansfield (1985) 232, n. 19.</page><page sequence="92">ATHENA PARTHENOS 73 section above, evidence is coming to light of an earlier cult on the site of the Classical Parthenon and it is possible that Pheidias's statue of Athena was made to perpetuate that cult. Nick's examination of the use of the words aya'|ia, ëôoç and Oeóç to refer to Pheidias's statue in early sources, shows that there can be little doubt about the statue's status as an object of cult.201 These words were regularly used by ancient writers to designate cult statues. The official use of the iconography of the Athena Parthenos to represent the state on decree reliefs and coins provides strong supporting evidence for such a view.202 Herington had suggested that the name 'Parthenos' was a favourite Athenian epithet for Athena, which was associated with a specific cult of the goddess on the Athenian Akropolis, separate from the main Akropolis cult of Athena Polias; while Athena Polias was worshipped as a civic goddess in the northern part of the Akropolis, the warlike Athena Parthenos was worshipped from early times in the area later used for the construction of the Parthenon.203 In Greek sanctuaries worship centred around a deity, not a statue. It was therefore quite possible, and not unusual, to worship a deity under several different aspects in any given sanctuary. On the Akropolis, there is evidence that the goddess Athena was worshipped under many titles. As well as the private dedications to Athena Parthenos, mentioned above, the goddess was worshipped with cults and served by priestesses as Athena Nike, Athena Hygieia, Athena Polias, Athena Ergane and Athena Promachos. Thus, the 'Panathenaic' festival meant the great festival to Athena under all her aspects. Nick suggests that, as in several other Greek sanctuaries, the Akropolis possessed two cult images of their state goddess Athena.204 One of these was the ancient olive-wood xoanon, which came to be known as the Athena Polias. The appearance of this image is not well known, but it was small enough to be transportable and it had golden jewellery and attributes.205 The 'Zweitkultbild', or second cult statue, from the 430s BC onwards, according to Nick, was the Pheidian Athena. This statue followed in the tradition of the fighting 'Panathenaic' Athena of the 6th century BC, which can be seen on prize amphorae, on vases related to cult worship as well as on Athenian coins. The armed and warlike Athena 'Promachos' known from such representations is likely to have been worshipped in statue form in the Archaic period, but the old image certainly disappeared after 480 BC. Nick connects the evidence for cult practices in the area of the Parthenon with the Archaic, warlike Athena which the Pheidian image replaced. According to this theory, the Pheidian representation offered a new and contemporary vision of the warrior goddess which aptly symbolized Athens in its role at the centre of the Delian League. Athena was still armed but she now stood in a peaceful attitude, the colossal size of the statue and the splendour of its materials reflecting the pride and self-confidence of the Athenian State in the mid- fifth century BC. 201 Nick (2002) 12ff. 202 Nick (1997) 22-24 and (2002) 190-92.

The gold formed small plates that were used primarily for the goddess's robe and these were affixed in such a way that they could be removed, if need be, and replaced without damaging the statue. According to Thucydides, Perikles told the Athenians that the gold of the Parthenos, which belonged to the state, was a reserve that could be used in case of crisis, and other sources state that the gold could be removed for the purpose of weighing it, to check that none was missing.207 The practice of adorning statues with gold ornaments, such as crowns, necklaces, earrings, and so on, which could be removed when necessary, was common.208 This feature in itself, therefore, does not disprove that the Pheidian Athena was venerated as a cult statue. Treasury inventory lists show how carefully sanctuaries looked after the treasures of the gods. In times of great crisis objects were occasionally melted down but, on the whole, they were closely guarded and preserved. For, as Linders observes, they were gifts made to the gods by people who believed in their gods.209 Preisshofen argued that the Parthenon was a treasury rather than a temple,210 but this view is disproved not only by the evidence for cult activity found within the building but also by early references to the Parthenon as vewç, as well as the size and plan of the building and its adornment with a frieze depicting an act of cult.211 These factors are all important indications of the status of the Parthenon and, therefore, of the image held within. Final proof would be afforded by the discovery of an altar outside the building but, as Nick shows, there are various possible explanations as to why no such altar has been found.212 Two scholia on Demosthenes suggest that the Athena Parthenos was set up as a victory monument after the Persian Wars, using Persian spoils.213 That victory in the Persian Wars was central to the project to rebuild the Akropolis and to honour the gods with new images is clear from the fact that the building project began very soon after Athens finally made peace with Persia and from the fact that the Parthenon, which housed the Athena Parthenos, was constructed on the site of the temple destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC. 206 See Philochoros, scholia Aristophanes, Pax 605-06; Thucydides, 11.13; Plutarch, De vit. aero al, 2; Diodorus Siculus, XII.40.3. 207 Thucydides, 11.13. Concerning the checks made, see Donnay (1968b) 2 Iff. Lykourgos carried out a thorough revision of the sacred treasures between 334/333 BC and 331/330 BC, melting down damaged offerings to create new ones. See Ferguson (1932) 122-23; IG II-III2, 333, 457: Ps.-Plut., X orat. 852 a. Some of the sources suggest that the gold revetment was actually removed in about 297 BC by the Athenian tyrant Lachares, who used it to pay his troops. On this matter see Pausanias, 1.25.7; Demetrios, comic poet, apud Athenaios, IX.405F; Phlegon Trallensis, FGrH IIB no. 257a F4; Plutarch, De Is. et Os.

The idea that the Athena Parthenos was a victory monument, however, is implausible, not only because there was no dedicatory inscription to record the specific conflict which motivated building the statue but also because the money used to build the work came not from tithes of war but from another source entirely: along with the temple itself, the cult image was financed with money from the treasuries of Athena along with contributions from other official sources of state revenue as well as donations from private individuals and perhaps other sanctuary treasuries.215 (C) HOW THE STATUE WAS CREATED The statue was probably constructed in a workshop, situated immediately to the south of the Parthenon, which had roughly the same dimensions and orientation as the temple naos. The workshop was discovered in excavations in the 1880s.216 Stevens suggested that in order to make this colossal and complex work, Pheidias made a series of models in clay, wax, plaster or wood.217 At least one model must have been of a considerable size, perhaps as large as life-size, so that all the rich detail of the work could be displayed upon it. The model was probably carefully finished, in order to prevent the possibility of any defects in the model statue being transferred to the colossal statue. Pheidias might then have used a system of enlargement to create the colossal statue from the model statue. The simple modern method of enlargement is the three co-ordinate system. It works on the principle that the position of a point is determined by three co-ordinates, and, if one multiplies these by the desired enlargement, one obtains the new position of the point on the enlarged statue. Weber points out that there is no written evidence concerning how the statue was copied, and also that the statue was rarely, if ever, fully copied, but she suggests that many of the different parts must have been based on a model, which could later be reused in order both to repair damage and also to copy parts of the work.218 The fact that there is more variation in some aspects of the work than in others, in the known versions of the type, suggests that not all parts of the work could be copied in a mechanical way. 214 See Höcker and Schneider (2001) fig. 118. 215 See the Parthenon building accounts inscriptions.

It is thought probable that IG I3, 460.15, which records an enormous expenditure on one aspect of the statue, might well refer to the cost of its wooden interior. To this armature would have been affixed the more fully shaped core of the statue, which could also have been made primarily of wood.223 Using the evidence of Pausanias' s description of the Zeus at Megara and the moulds recovered from the workshop of Pheidias at Olympia, Lapatin wonders whether the hollow core was all wooden, as is generally supposed, or whether parts of it were in fact made of plaster.224 He suggests that piece moulds might have been made to create a cast plaster outer core for sections to which ivory would later be attached. The advantages of making the outer core in plaster are that it would have been easier than doing so in wood, and probably more durable. Concerning the question of how detailed the exterior shape of the core of the Parthenos was, one should take into account the evidence provided by the Zeus at Olympia, of which the interior was probably made using a fairly similar technique. This statue was transported to Constantinople in the early 5th century AD and remained on view there until it was destroyed by fire in AD 475. It seems likely that during these last fifty or so years, and possibly longer, the statue was bereft of its gold ornament.225 Nevertheless, it was clearly regarded as a treasure, and it formed the centrepiece of the collection in which it was housed. Its influence was great, for its iconography was adopted by Christian artists for the bearded Christ Pantocrator. This suggests that the support beneath the outer layer of gold and ivory was fully modelled. 219 Later sources which describe the statue as made of ivory include, for instance, Aristides, 34.28; Cicero, Brutus , 73.257; Ovid, Ex Ponto , IV.1.31; Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.323. Pliny, NH 34.54, and Pausanias, 1.24.5-7 both say the work was of ivory and gold. 220 See section 4 of this chapter, concerning the base. 221 Dio Chrysostomos, XII.49. Lapatin (2001) 70 connects the central timber of the Parthenos with the gift to the people of Athens of a massive piece of cypress by an Eteokarpathian, his son and community, recorded in an inscription, IG I3, 1454, dated to c.445^30 BC by Lewis. 222 Lucian, Gallus , 24, and Jup.

Lapatin (2001) 72-73. 225 Kedrenos, 1.564, describes it as an 'ivory' statue.</page><page sequence="96">ATHENA PARTHENOS 77 The thin, outer layer of the statue consisted of gold and ivory. The gold plates probably consisted of small sheets of hammered gold carefully fitted together.226 Lapatin suggests several different techniques for the attachment of the gold plates, but the one he prefers, which can be seen on a contemporary work, consists of narrow grooves, inconspicuously cut into the surface to be covered, into which silver attachment wire was sunk. Strips of metal may also have been added here, to act as anchors.227 But by far the most complicated part of the statue was the revetment in ivory. Being on such a large scale, the statue would have posed some very awkward problems. Lapatin looks into the question of how the ivory was worked in some detail and after carrying out a number of experiments himself.228 He concludes that ivory veneers were probably produced for Pheidias by specialist ivory cutters, or é'ec1)avT0TÓ|i0i, who knew how to unfurl substantial sheets of ivory out of tusks. These were softened by |ia'aKTf¡pes éX€&lt;1)avToç, a term found in Plutarch's list of artisans employed in the Athenian building programme which started shortly after 450 BC, and then moulded to the desired shape, while still wet and flexible.229 Lapatin suggests that the ivory was probably put into negative moulds and then held in place over the core until it hardened to exactly the shape required. In addition to the natural adhesive quality of drying ivory, glue would also have been required to hold the moulded segments of ivory in place, but, once carefully pieced together, joins in the ivory would have been difficult to see. The visible parts of the body, such as the feet, arms, neck, and face, were rendered in ivory and the goddess's attire was made of gold. The eyes were inlaid in stone. There is no direct evidence concerning the material used for the goddess's hair and helmet figures, though these could well have been rendered in gold. While Pausanias states that the aegis gorgoneion was made of ivory, he does not specify the material of the aegis itself. It may possibly have been made of ivory rather than gold, as traditionally maintained, though gold would have contrasted better with the ivory gorgoneion. This matter is discussed below. It is probable that the larger metal accessories of the goddess, such as the shield, 226 From the fragmentary accounts of the building of the Athena Parthenos, IG I3 453-460, especially years 440/439 BC and 434/433 BC, it seems clear that the Athenian commissioners in charge of supervising the project were buying the gold they required at an officially set rate, namely a silver to gold ratio of fourteen to one. This differed somewhat from the market price of gold at this period, which was probably around thirteen to one. See Herodotus, III.95, and the commentary on this passage by How and Wells (1912) I. 287. Since there was no gold in Attica and gold was in any case scarce in the 5th century BC, the Athenians could not have bought the quantities of gold required to make the statue on the open market without forcing up the price of gold enormously. Eddy (1977) 107-11 has argued that the most obvious source for the gold was the electrum and gold coinage which was paid to Athens by her allies in the Delian League as part of their annual tribute. The amount required for Pheidias 's colossal work would have totalled one and a half years of tribute payments, the equivalent of over 600 talents in silver. The Delian League was organized in 478/477 BC and by 450 BC the treasure had a value of over 5,000 talents of silver (see Papyrus Decree, ATL II, D 13). Whether Eddy is correct in this theory remains difficult to ascertain. 227 Lapatin (2001) 74. 228 Lapatin (1997) 67 1 ff; (2001) 74-78. 229 Plutarch, Per. 12.6.</page><page sequence="97">78 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the sphinx on the helmet, and the spear were all made of gilded bronze rather than solid gold. The serpent crouching at the goddess's feet may also have been of gilded bronze, though Donnay suggested that the serpent may have been of ivory.230 The large figure of Nike on the goddess's outstretched hand was chryselephantine, like Athena herself.231 (D) WAS THERE AN OWL IN THE COMPOSITION? According to Dio Chrysostomos, Pheidias made a representation of an owl which was erected together with Athena.232 Since Dio goes on to talk about the shield of the Athena Parthenos, it has been thought possible that he is referring to an owl that was included in the original composition of the same statue. Several minor reflections of the Parthenos include an owl and, as this bird is regularly associated with the goddess in Classical times, its presence somewhere in the composition of the Athena Parthenos would not be surprising. On a couple of gold medallions from S. Russia, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg (Fig. 6.1), and on a terracotta medallion in the Royal Ontario Museum, no. 962.263, the owl features perched on a cheek piece of the goddess's helmet. There is also a statuette of the Athena Parthenos which has the owl standing on the statue base.233 A lead token, found in front of the theatre of Herodes Atticus, shows the Athena Parthenos with an owl in front of her, perched on an altar.234 As Leipen has shown, however, the owls on the medallions may have been added simply to fill in the composition, while the owl on the base of the little marble statuette may have helped to indicate that the goddess was indeed Athena.235 The owl on the lead token may have served the same identifying purpose, or it may have been used to fill up the available space. It may even represent an owl that was not part of the Parthenos composition, but which did stand somewhere on the Akropolis. In all these examples it is clear that the copyists cannot be trusted in every detail they show, for they have certainly altered the composition to suit their needs. From Dio's comment, one can infer no more than that the owl was probably placed somewhere on the Akropolis, and without stronger evidence it would be foolish to conclude that the owl he mentions was in the Parthenon and, more precisely still, a part of the Parthenos composition. It may be significant that no other author, including Pliny, who takes time to note a number of details, makes any mention of an owl in his description of the Parthenos. The only written sources other than Dio that mention an owl on the Akropolis are the very late writers Hesychios and Ausonius.236 The link with Pheidias in Hesychios's text may not amount to more than a wishful emendation: Latte prefers the reading 'Phaidros' 230 Donnay (1968a) 20, n. 4. 231 The Nike is discussed in section 5 of this chapter. 232 Dio Chrysostomos, XII.6. 233 Paribeni (1958) no.

He writes of an owl made by Iktinos, the architect of the Parthenon, which was covered in a special paint and which was used to attract all manner of birds and to kill them 'by its stare'. That images of owls were set up to trap birds can be seen from a vase painting on a Laconian black-figure neck amphora: an owl on a long stick is set near a tree, of which the branches have been smeared with lime. Many birds are shown on the branches of the tree and tumbling to the ground.238 One can infer from Ausonius that the owl of which he speaks must have stood out of doors and served the purpose of keeping birds away from the holy monuments, so that they would not foul them. Indeed from Athenian coins of the Roman period that depict the Akropolis, one can deduce that this 'apotropaic' owl stood on the north-eastern or eastern part of the Akropolis, near the peripheral wall.239 It is possible that Dio is not relating the owl he mentions to Pheidias's Athena at all, but that he is in fact referring to the 'apotropaic' owl of the Akropolis, which he claims is by Pheidias, though Ausonius attributes it to Pheidias's colleague, the architect, Iktinos. In connection with these sources, one should bear in mind a group of sources alluding to the fact that the Akropolis was a birdless place.240 6.2. THE STATUE OF ATHENA According to Pliny, the Athena Parthenos measured 26 cubits, and Pausanias states that the figure of Nike on Athena's hand measured about 4 cubits.241 Following Stevens's estimated naos height of 13.09m, and using the Roman foot of 0.296m for her calculations, Leipen estimated that the whole composition measured 11.544m in height, the statue being about 10m high, the base about 1.5m high.242 But Stevens's naos height is now known to be wrong: Korres gives the height of the inner colonnade alone as 13.5m high. Furthermore, it is generally thought likely that the statue was built using the same length of foot as that used in the construction of the temple. Pheidias's statue was after all the centre-piece of the temple and the object which had to some extent dictated the need for certain unusual architectural features employed in its construction. In the naos these include the great width of the chamber, the two-storey colonnade running behind the statue as well as along the two sides of the naos, and the placing of the ceiling at the greatest height allowed by the construction of the roof.243 It now seems probable that the unit employed 237 Latte (1963) 379. 238 Johnston (1993) 72, fig. 67. 239 See Imhoof-Blümer &amp; Gardner (1887) pl. 75 Z6. Confirmation that there were large owl sculptures on the Akropolis in the 5th century BC is provided by the fine statue Akropolis Museum 1347, which is said to have been found close to the Parthenon on the north or west side. See Brouskari (1974) 23, fig. 11. 240 See Lucretius, De rerum nat. 6.749-52, and Philostratus, De vita Ap. Ty. 2.10 and notes. 241 Pliny, NH 36.19; Pausanias, 1.24.7. 242 Leipen (1971) 23. 243 Korres and Bouras (1983) 13 and 28.</page><page sequence="99">80 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS for the construction of the temple was neither the Ionic foot of about 0.294m, which was about the same length as the Roman foot, nor the longer Doric foot of 0.326m, as some have argued.244 According to de Waele, the unit which best fits the measurements of the Parthenon is the non-standard length of 0.307m.245 On the grounds that there was probably no such thing as a standard foot in 5th century BC Athens and that the Greeks did not like using a foot length which would have resulted in awkward fractions, de Waele concludes that 0.307m was the basic unit of the Parthenon. If the same unit was used for the statue then the Parthenos composition, including the base, probably measured 1 1.973m in height. Anything higher seems to be ruled out by the height of the naos, which cannot have been much greater than that of its two-storey colonnade. A reasonable height above the top of the helmet was required both to prevent the statue looking cramped and to accommodate the long spear at the goddess's left side. From numerous later works based on the Parthenos, it seems that the goddess's head was turned very slightly towards the figure's right, the side of the supporting leg, in the manner of contemporary original sculptures. This characteristic is observable in the Belgrade statuette (Fig. 6.10), though it is avoided in many of the Roman marble copies. The position of the legs was between that of early Classical figures and Polykleitan figures: the weight-bearing right leg was straight, while the relaxed left leg was bent at the knee with the foot set somewhat to the side and the heel slightly raised. The left arm was lowered, the hand gently touching the rim of the upright shield at the goddess's side, while the right arm was bent at the elbow and the outstretched hand carried the figure of Nike upon it. For technical reasons, some of the Roman marble copies show the lower right arm held in a wide angle.246 Two-dimensional images and the little terracottas from Delos, on the other hand, suggest that the arm was bent at about a right angle. (A) PEPLOS AND BELT Most works following the type of the Athena Parthenos agree concerning the dress of the goddess, which Pausanias simply describes as an ankle-length chiton. Athena wore a traditional woollen robe generally known as the Doric peplos that was sleeveless, open down her right side, and tied at the waist with a belt. It had a long, girdled overfold with kolpoi. Characteristic folds repeated on many works are the flat fold falling from the left knee, the strong, central fold between the legs, the V-shaped folds beneath the aegis, with the deep folds of the kolpoi on either side, and the light folds of cloth over the left foot (Fig. 6.2). The deep undercutting of the overfold of the peplos in many of the marble copies betrays the metal technique of the original work. The folds along the open, right side of the garment differ considerably from one copy to another. Leipen distinguishes the more archaic diamond pattern folds seen on numerous examples including, for instance, the Belgrade statuette (Fig. 6.10), and the more naturalistic parallel zigzag folds found on only a few examples, for instance the Varvakeion (Fig. 6.3) and Madrid statuettes.247 Other statues, such as for instance the Akropolis torso, inv. no. 1362, appear to mix both 244 Harrison (1982) 59. 245 de Waele (1984) 99. 246 For example, the Lenormant statuette and the statue from Gortyn (Figs. 6.12 and 9). 247 Leipen (1971) 28-29.</page><page sequence="100">ATHENA PARTHENOS 8 1 traditions (Fig. 6.11). It is possible that there was no model for copyists to follow in respect of this part of the statue and that in their reduced marble versions copyists simplified the design of the original metal pattern. An unusual feature of Athena's attire is her belt, which takes the form of two snakes knotted together, their heads meeting at the front and their tails intertwined at the back. This arrangement is clearly visible on the Boston statuette, for instance (Fig. 6.6). The idea echoes the snake pattern around the Gorgon's head on the shield, as seen, for instance, on the Strangford shield (Fig. 6.33). Given the snakes writhing on the aegis, the enormous snake by the goddess's side and the monstrous creatures visible on Athena's helmet, such a belt is very much in keeping with the rest of the composition. (B) AEGIS There are few references to the aegis of the Athena Parthenos in the ancient sources, but that she wore one is clear both from these few references as well as from the available material evidence. During one of his illnesses, Aristides had a vision of Athena wearing the aegis, and although he does not specifically name the Athena Parthenos it seems fairly certain that this is the statue to which he is referring.248 He calls it 'the Athena of Pheidias at Athens', and the Parthenos was surely the most famous of the works that could be described in this manner. Maximus of Tyre, who also mentions the aegis on a statue of Athena by Pheidias, is equally unspecific in his reference about quite which statue he means.249 The description he gives, however, perfectly fits the Parthenos and the context, which makes an unstated parallel between this work and the Zeus at Olympia, reinforces the impression that the author can only be talking about Pheidias 's other great chryselephantine work, namely the Parthenos. Pausanias, whose description of the Parthenos as a whole is so brief and undetailed, does not mention the aegis itself. He does, however, state that on her breast the goddess had a head of Medusa made of ivory. This Medusa must have been set on the aegis and, since Pausanias specifies the material of the Medusa head, it is usually thought that the aegis itself was made of a different material, presumably gold. Weber has challenged this idea, pointing to the evidence of the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax 605-06.250 In this text, which is difficult to interpret, the first scholiast comments that Pheidias was tried for falsifying the accounts for the ivory used to make the 'scales' (tós (1)oXi8aç), while the second scholiast comments that Pheidias stole the gold from the serpents of the Parthenos. Weber maintains that the primary meaning of the word (1&gt;oXíç is the scale of a reptile. She therefore concludes that the ivory scales to which the first scholiast is referring must be those of the aegis. She agrees with Leipen that the second scholiast is referring to the fringe of golden snakes that were set around the ivory aegis.251 Works following the scheme of the Athena Parthenos generally show the goddess wearing an aegis. Often the aegis is shown covered in scales and fringed with writhing snakes, though the number and disposition of the snakes as well as the details of the scales vary considerably from one work to the next, suggesting that this part of the work could 248 Aristides, Or. 48.41. 249 Maximus of Tyre, Dial. 8.6. 250 Weber (1993) 114-15. 251 Leipen (1971) 29.</page><page sequence="101">82 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS not be copied mechanically, perhaps for technical reasons. Using the scales of the Varvakeion statuette as a guide (Fig. 6.4), Weber estimates that the visible part of each scale was probably about as big as an A4 sheet.252 In favour of the view that the snakes around the aegis were made of metal, probably gold, and inserted into an aegis of different material, Weber points to the fact that this very technique is known to have been used on several replicas, notably the large marble statue from the Pergamon Library, now in Berlin. Small holes are clearly visible along the rolled up border of the aegis and on either side of the central gorgoneion and these must once have been used to affix the metal snakes. The advantage of having separately attached snakes in metal is that these could be shown twisting about in a very lively manner, as one can see them depicted on the Aspasios gem, for instance. There is also evidence to suggest that the goddess's spear was supported in the coil of one of these serpents.253 It is true that on most statues of Athena Parthenos type and in many vase paintings the pattern of the aegis could be described as appearing scaly.254 Why this should be the case, however, is not clear. In origin, the aegis was a magical goat-skin bag containing a serpent and protected by a Gorgon mask in the centre and a fringe of serpents around the edge. According to Herodotus, the idea of the aegis came to the Greeks from the Libyans, whose women wore a goat-skin, fringed with leather thongs, as a chastity tunic.255 Athena wore the aegis from her birth as part of her armour: it was a kind of breast-plate. But she acquired the Gorgon's head at a later stage, when Perseus had beheaded this monster. According to some stories, Athena reared Erechtheus in her aegis. There is never a suggestion in the myths that the aegis was made of anything other than goat's wool. It therefore seems likely that the pattern on the aegis was originally intended to represent locks of wool rather than scales or, as sometimes appears to be the case, feathers.256 The curled locks are clearly visible on a panathenaic-shaped amphora of around 540 BC, attributed to the Princeton Painter.257 But on other vases the texture of the aegis is rendered in many different ways: dots; C-shaped curls; C-shaped curls with a dot in the middle; even multi-patterned, like fabric.258 252 Weber (1993) 115. 253 See Hermitage medallions, cat. no.

On aesthetic grounds, a Medusa of contrasting colour and material would seem more appropriate. As mentioned earlier, assuming that the aegis was primarily of gold provides a straightforward interpretation of Pausanias's comment regarding the material of the Medusa head. It also means that a connection with the difficult passage in the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax 605-06, is less likely. In that passage, the word (1)oXíç may have referred to the scales of a reptile, as Weber insists, or it may have borne a technical sense, as Donnay first suggested, but in the first sense it would hardly be a suitable word for the description of a woolly goat-skin.259 The shape of the aegis is not known for certain, for this too varies considerably from one version to another. In some cases it is large and fairly square in shape, and it covers the breasts and the shoulder blades. This form can be seen on the Varvakeion (Fig. 6.4) and Lenormant statuettes (Fig. 6.12), for example, and the statues in Boston (Fig. 6.6), Madrid (Fig. 6.8), and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. In other cases, the aegis is shown to be much smaller than this and to have a wide V shape. Take, for example, the Patras (Fig. 6.13), Argos and Turin statuettes and the Aspasios gem (Fig. 6.20). An intermediate form which is more rounded in outline and also slightly shorter than the first type is that seen on the statue from Gortyn, for instance (Fig. 6.9). Leipen favours the first type, as seen on the Varvakeion statuette, which she regards as lying between the archaic aegis, which was long and mantle-like, and the form of aegis favoured in later times, which she describes as having "an abbreviated, collar-like form".260 Boardman, on the other hand, prefers the "small, bib-like aegis".261 At all events it is probable that the original aegis was of the rare form which joined in the middle at the front, as it is shown to do in many works imitating the Parthenos. Whether or not this is a Pheidian creation remains uncertain. Sparkes draws attention to a figure of Athena depicted on a red-figure column- krater, Berlin inv. 2928, wearing just such an aegis, and he wonders whether the date sometimes assigned to the vase, of 460-450 BC, is accurate or whether it could be later, as Shefton, for instance, has claimed.262 The same form of aegis can also be seen on the Athena of the Baksy krater, a figure which is known to quote from the Parthenos statue in other respects (Fig. 6.78).263 As to the ivory head of the Medusa at the centre of the aegis, the copies tend to agree that it was flat and round, with protruding tongue, and hair parted at the centre and waved. Unlike the early type of Medusa, it was recognizably human rather than monstrous: it lacked fangs, and the mouth was not as wide as in Archaic representations. The whole impact of the aegis, with its gorgoneion, twisting serpents and bristling 'scales' was apotropaic, and it was conceived more as an article of dress than as a piece of armour. 259 Donnay (1968a) 20 n. 4.

The Varvakeion and Belgrade statuettes both have simple snake bracelets with two or three coils (Figs. 6.2 and 6.15). On the original statue these bracelets would no doubt have been made of gold. The type copied on these statuettes was popular in the Classical period, as can be seen from surviving examples of the time, as well as from representations on vase paintings.264 Both statuettes have bracelets near the wrists, but the Belgrade statuette also has bracelets on the upper arm, which is a much more unusual position for them. Leipen thinks the bracelets on the upper arm may reflect the original statue, on which they may have been needed for technical reasons, both to conceal joints and to reinforce the arms.265 The earrings, as can be seen from the Hermitage medallions, the Aspasios gem, (Figs. 6.1 and 6.20) and the Athenian 'new style' tetradrachms, were also of a type that was popular at the time the statue was created: a disc covering the lobe of the ear attached to a pendant. Again, these would have been made of gold, probably, and they were no doubt adorned with elaborate patterns.266 The Aspasios gem and the Hermitage medallions also show Athena wearing an intricate, triple necklace. None of the larger replicas have the necklace, except the Louvre 'Minerve au collier' which has a simple string of round beads (Fig. 6.14). But this is mostly a modern restoration, added to conceal a break. It is possible that the representations in the minor arts reflect the original work more faithfully on this matter than some of the larger works based on the Parthenos. That the goddess should be represented wearing jewellery is unexpected. Jewellery is often seen on Archaic statues, but it is not common on Classical statues. Furthermore, it appears all the more incongruous considering that the goddess is fully armed. And yet its appropriateness in this composition has been commented upon by Fehr.267 Like the weapons of the goddess, her aegis, dress and sandals, the jewellery is a product of 'techne'. Athena was the goddess of crafts but, in addition to this, 'techne' takes on a more important role in the context of contemporary Athenian radical democracy. As a monument to democracy, this composition pays tribute to the practical skills and professions exercised by democrats, and traditionally despised by the old aristocracy. Athena's jewellery also emphasizes the more charming and feminine aspects of the goddess, just as the outstretched right hand with Nike upon it shows her kindliness towards humans. This aspect of the goddess, which Fehr calls 'chads', is contrasted with Athena's more austere and threatening qualities, as exhibited in her weapons, helmet, aegis, and her accompanying serpent. As a warrior goddess she will ensure justice, she will punish the wicked, she will bring 'nemesis'. Ridgway has suggested that the elaborate helmet of Athena echoes a type occasionally found in Archaic statuary.268 Such an adaptation of an 264 For an example of the type of bracelet, see British Museum Cat Jewellery, no. 2775, fig. 89.

(D) FACE AND HAIR Maximus says that Athena was portrayed as a beautiful, owl-eyed maiden, and Plato states that while her face was made of ivory, the eyes were inlaid in a stone which closely resembled ivory.269 This suggests that the eyes were perhaps made using at least two different types of stone, one for the white part of the eye and a coloured stone for the iris. The archaeological evidence for the face and hair is very varied. Two features of the head which are generally imitated and probably do reflect the original are the slight turn of the neck to the figure's right, in the direction of Nike, and the gently parted lips. The latter feature can be seen on the Priene head fragment, the Varvakeion statuette (Fig. 6.4), the Pergamon Athena, and the head in Berlin, K170 (Fig. 6.17).270 One might also compare the Kassel Apollo (Fig. 13.2) and the Riace bronzes (Figs. 19.2 and 19.4). Concerning the shape of the face at least two traditions exist. Leipen favours the "massive oval with a rather heavy, rounded chin" which is seen in the majority of replicas, including the Varvakeion statuette, the 'Minerve au collier', the Antiochos statue (Figs. 6.4, 6.14 and 6.16) and the Civitavecchia head, as well as most of the representations in the minor arts, in particular the Aspasios gem and the Hermitage medallions (Figs. 6.20 and 6.1).271 On the other hand, Prag prefers the more graceful and slender appearance of the Berlin head (Fig. 6.17), the Madrid statuette (Fig. 6.8) and the Copenhagen head (Fig. 6.18).272 Leipen regards this type of head as too elongated and slender, though she admits that the fleshiness of the Varvakeion statuette is probably exaggerated. Vermeule too favours what he calls "the large, heavy-lidded eyes and fuller face", as exhibited also in the Boston Athena (Fig. 6.6), which he thinks reflects the Pheidian original.273 He describes the Copenhagen and Berlin heads as "both strongly 'classical', Hadrianic interpretations of the Parthenos". There is no firm evidence concerning the material used to make the hair of Athena, though it is generally thought to have been made of metal. Since the hair is shown in a variety of ways on the extant versions of the type, it is likely that copyists did not have at their disposal a model of this part of the composition from which to work. There are three distinct parts to the hair: the hair protruding from under the helmet on either side of the face, the shoulder locks, and the bunched tress at the back. The most common arrangement consists of about four tight curls on the temples, in front of the ears, two locks lying on each shoulder and the hair at the back of the head loosely braided down half its length and then tied with a ribbon, the lower part of the hair being arranged in a series of thick corkscrew curls. Along with the jewellery and the elaborately adorned helmet visor, the shoulder locks echo Archaic fashions. In some versions of the type, for example the 269 Maximus, Dial. 15.6, and Plato, Hipp. Mai. 290b. 270 For the Priene fragment, see Carter (1983) 210, fig. 18, 237-8, cat. no. 72. 73; pl. 33 a-c. 271 Leipen (1971) 31. 272 Prag (1984) 182.

In other versions, as for instance the Civitavecchia torso and other Italian statues, the locks are much more serpentine. Although many versions of the type agree in having thick curls before the ears, a different arrangement which is also fairly common has wavy hair brushed to each side of the face. See, for instance, the Pergamon Library statue, and the heads from Cyrene. There is also variation concerning small locks on the forehead, sometimes shown curling up on to the browband; some statues include them and others, like the Varvakeion, do not have any in this position at all. (E) HELMET Maximus of Tyre states simply that Athena Parthenos wore a helmet, but both Pliny and Pausanias make it clear that this helmet was of an exceptional kind and that it was one of the outstanding parts of the composition.274 In his very brief account of the statue, Pausanias comments that on the central part of the helmet there was a sphinx, with griffins in relief on either side. Pausanias was clearly very taken with the griffins and he recalls that, according to a poem by Aristeas of Prokonnesos, these monsters - winged lions with eagles' heads - had to fight to protect their gold from the one-eyed Arimaspl. According to Pliny, the sphinx was particularly admired by experts. Pliny describes the sphinx as situated under the tip of the spear. He also says that it was made of bronze. In order to fit in with the rest of the statue, the bronze must have been gilded. In general design, the helmet was of the Attic type with a strong neck guard at the back and large, upturned cheek-pieces, attached to the helmet with hinges. Reflections of the helmet in other works vary a good deal in all their details, not least the shape and size of the neck guard. Leipen distinguishes three main types, but she favours the type which is most sharply set off from the dome of the helmet, has straight edges and descends lowest down the neck.275 An example of the type can be seen on the Aspasios gem, for instance (Fig. 6.20). This type would have provided the strongest support for the rich ornaments carried on the dome. The neck guard may have been adorned with a scale motif enclosed by a profiled edge, as on the Aspasios gem. At the front of the helmet was a browband which in many versions is shown with a peak pointing up on the upper edge and a peak pointing down on the lower edge. This probably reflects the original work. In some versions - for example, the Hermitage medallions - the edges are straight but, according to Leipen, this form was most common in the period before the Athena Parthenos. There may also have been some sort of floral pattern with tendrils on the lower part of the dome of the helmet, as can be seen on the 'new style' tetradrachms, as well as certain later works dependent on the Parthenos, such as the Imperial head from Larissa (Fig. 6.21), the Cologne and Louvre heads, and the Aspasios gem. The sphinx on the top of the helmet, which supported the central plume, was worked in the round. It was probably made in metal, perhaps in gilded bronze, if Pliny can be interpreted to mean this. Several recognized copies of the helmet preserve traces of the sphinx, often not more than parts of the paws: for example, the Belgrade statuette, the 'Minerve au collier' in Paris, the Boston statue, the Civitavecchia, Cologne, Copenhagen and Berlin, K170, heads. Some examples show the whole creature: for example, the 274 Maximus of Tyre, Dial. 8.6; Pliny, NH 36.19; Pausanias, 1.24.5-6. 275 Leipen (1971) 32.</page><page sequence="106">ATHENA PARTHENOS 87 Varvakeion statuette and the statue in Madrid. Using the scale of the Varvakeion statuette as a guide, Schuchhardt estimated that the sphinx and the crest of the original statue probably measured some 1.50m in height.276 Hafner has pointed out that the interest of ancient commentators and copyists alike often seems to focus on beautiful or intricate details of the Athena Parthenos.277 Since the sphinx is known to have been regarded as particularly beautiful, as Pliny testifies, Hafner thinks that it is very likely that full-size copies of the sphinx on its own were produced in ancient times. He points out that the scale, design and function of the work lend themselves perfectly as models for the production of sphinx table supports, which were popular in Roman times, and he identifies the Parthenos sphinx type with that of the sphinx table supports in Naples and the British Museum (Fig. 6.22).278 Other copies of the head type which Hafner identifies are the heads in Basel (Fig. 6.23) and in the Agora Museum in Athens.279 From these sculptures, it appears that the sphinx in question was represented as having the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of an eagle and the tail of a serpent. The creature was shown sitting on its haunches (unlike the sphinxes of the Varvakeion statuette and the Madrid statue), it had a very expressionless face and, as observed by Weber, the head was turned very slightly to its left.280 The hair of the sphinx was shown parted in the middle, with neat, wavy strands combed back and held in place by a fillet. Hafher is of the opinion that the Basel and Athens examples of this head type are probably more faithful to the original than the others which, he thinks, may have been modified, in details such as the style of the hair, in order to suit later tastes. In early versions of the story, as for instance in Hesiod, Theog. 326, the sphinx is portrayed as a monster, but in this composition and in keeping with Classical art, she is represented with the beautiful and serious face of a young woman. She is the "wise virgin" of the tragic poets.281 Concerning the significance of the sphinx, Hafner puts forward the suggestion that, unlike the sphinx arm rests of Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia, where the sphinx represented the demon of death, the sphinx on Athena's helmet is the inscrutible and enigmatic creature of the famous riddle from Delphi. As such, she is a symbol of wisdom and a messenger of divine justice. Her wisdom is the antithesis of that of the goddess Athena. For, while Athena teaches wisdom to man for his good, the wisdom of the sphinx results only in harm and, ultimately, in destruction. As well as the central plume, carried by the sphinx, the helmet had two other plumes borne by a pair of pegasoi, which stood on either side of the sphinx. These winged horses are not mentioned in the sources, but they are well attested through archaeological evidence. They are clearly visible on the Boston Athena, for example, as well as on the Varvakeion statuette, and the heads in Berlin, K170, and Copenhagen..282 They are also 276 Schuchhardt (1963) 40, n. 25. 277 Hafner (1975) 9. 278 Hafner (1975) figs. 5 and 6. 279 Hafner (1975) figs. 7, 8 and 10. 280 Weber (1993) 118. 281 Euripides, Phoenissae , 48. 282 Fragments of pegasoi can also be seen on the related Athena Hope type head in Side.</page><page sequence="107">88 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS included on the Aspasios gem, the Athenian 'new style' tetradrachm,283 the gold medallion in the Hermitage Museum, and some terracotta plaques and medallions.284 From these pieces it seems that the pegasoi were carved almost completely in the round, like the sphinx, and that their wings curved upwards. According to Hafner, the significance of the pegasoi in this composition comes from the story of Bellerophon.285 The winged horse, Pegasos, here represented twice, was the gift of Athena to Bellerophon. Athena mastered the horse by inventing the bit, which she put in its mouth.286 With the help of Pegasos, Bellerophon succeeded in destroying the Chimaera. But Zeus later thwarted Bellerophon 's attempt to fly to heaven on Pegasos 's back. The presence of the pegasoi illustrates the kindliness of Athena to mankind, not only as the giver of gifts but also as the goddess of crafts. As can be seen from the Boston statue, the Berlin head, K170, the Aspasios gem and the Hermitage medallions, the upturned cheek-pieces of the helmet were adorned in relief with a griffin rearing up on its hind legs in an aggressive attitude. For obvious reasons, these griffins are often omitted on reflections of the type in reduced scale, but they must have been fairly large on the original statue, perhaps about 0.50m in height. Pausanias seems to have thought that the griffins were next to the central sphinx. This mistake is understandable when one considers how large the cheek-pieces were. Their size and the way in which they protruded from the helmet would have obscured the view of the helmet from the floor. Simon has shown that griffins are extremely rare in early and high Classical art.287 In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, there are numerous examples of griffins in the minor arts, but they are usually shown sitting, walking or standing on all fours rather than rampant, though this form is seen very occasionally. Prior to the Athena Parthenos, griffins are never connected with Athena. Their representation in this context is, therefore, exceptional. Pausanias reminds us of the role of griffins in legend as the vigilant and ferocious guardians of gold, making it clear how appropriate their presence is on a statue made largely of this precious metal. An earlier large-scale golden sculpture which may have used the motif of rampant griffins was the Archaic statue of Apollo on Delos. For this reason, Fehr interprets the griffins as a visual link between the Athena Parthenos and the Apollo of Delos, believing that the parallel was made deliberately in order to convey to the viewer a political message justifying the central role of Athens in the Delian League after the transferrai of the League tribute payments from Delos to Athens in 454 BC. In the case of Apollo, there would be nothing remarkable about the presence of aggressive griffins at his sides: these mythical beasts were often his companions.288 But the evidence concerning the composition of the Apollo of Delos is perhaps not strong enough to allow one to go as far as Fehr would wish. On the bronze coinage of the 2nd century BC, which uses the image of the Apollo of Delos, the winged creatures are omitted. They are not 283 Leipen (1971) fig. 39. 284 Leipen (1971) figs. 48, 49, 51. 285 Hafner (1975) 12. 286 See, for instance, Pausanias, II.4.1, and Pindar, Ol. 13.60 ff. 287 Simon (1962) 752f. 288 See Simon (1962) 763ff.</page><page sequence="108">ATHENA PARTHENOS 89 mentioned in any written sources on the statue either. The only evidence available for the presence of the beasts is their depiction on a Hellenistic relief from the Maison de Fourni (A 6995) in Delos as well as on the series of Athenian "New-Style" silver tetradrachms, dating from the 2nd century BC, which probably marked the declaration by the Roman senate of the port of Delos as Athenian in 166 BC.289 In the relief, the beasts are shown flanking the god, sitting on small bases and supporting miniature korai. On the coins, they are rearing up on either side of the god, reaching most of the way up his thighs. Since the attitudes of the beasts differ in these two contexts, Romano finds it difficult to believe that they formed part of the original composition by Tektaios and Angelion, preferring to see them as Hellenistic additions. Furthermore, she doubts that they are griffins, as Furtwängler thought, and she follows Marcadé in identifying them as sphinxes.290 From the archaeological evidence it appears that the space above the browband, and below the large plume-bearing creatures on top of the dome of the helmet, was occupied by animal protomai. Many helmets which imitate the Parthenos type omit this detail, but it can be seen, sometimes in abbreviated form, on several works. These include the Aspasios gem, the Hermitage medallions, the 'new style' tetradrachms, the terracotta medallion in Athens,291 the Berlin (K170), Cologne, and Civitavecchia heads, the Boston statue, and the 'Minerve au collier' in Paris. Even though it is not a copy of the Athena Parthenos, the Palmyra head borrows the motif of the animal protomai (Fig. 6.19).292 The foreparts of thirteen animals, alternately winged and wingless, can be seen on this helmet. Prag is of the opinion that thirteen, and not eleven - as on the Minerve au collier and as favoured by Leipen - was probably the number on the Parthenos helmet too, for this allows one winged animal at each end as well as one winged animal at the centre of the composition.293 Unfortunately, all the heads are missing on the Palmyra helmet and there is no obvious size distinction between the animals. From other versions, however, it is clear both that the winged animals were probably larger than the others on the original work and that they represented pegasoi, while the smaller animals represented deer. Unlike pegasoi, deer are not normally associated with Athena and their presence here has suggested to Fehr that they were intended to create a link with Apollo - one of the gods naturally associated with deer and the hunt - and, through Apollo, with Delos.294 Ridgway has noted that animal protomai on helmets are occasionally seen on early vase paintings, and some Archaic statues, for example Antenor's kore, Akropolis Museum, no. 681, originally had metal embellishments attached to the helmet visor.295 According to Ridgway, this 289 For illustrations of the relief and the coin image, see LIMC II, nos. 390a and e.

Crowded as it was with so many beautiful and intricate animal figures, some of which were sculpted almost completely in the round, the helmet stood out as one of the most unusual and impressive elements of the composition. Because of its ornateness the helmet acquired a dual role: while retaining its function as part of the attire of a warrior, it also became one of the decorative features of the goddess's dress, along with her rich jewellery. In this way the two aspects of 'nemesis' and 'chads', which Fehr sees as fundamental aspects of the composition, are intertwined in the helmet.296 Fehr notes how unusual it was for a Classical statue to be adorned with so many wild and mythical beasts. In Archaic art, the idea of a goddess as mistress of animals is not uncommon, though the role is more often associated with Artemis than Athena. One may compare the Artemis of Ephesos.297 But in this monument, Fehr thinks another significance is intended. He interprets the presence of the beasts partly as an indication that through 'techne' Athena has the ability to husband animals, thereby creating and promoting order. (F) SANDALS AND FEET Very few of the written sources mention the sandals of the Athena Parthenos. Pollux cites them as an example of the Etruscan type of sandal, known as Tuppīļviicd, which had square wooden soles and gold-covered straps.298 Themistios does not describe them, but he mentions them to illustrate the amount of detail and care lavished by Pheidias on even the humblest parts of his works.299 Pliny too was struck by the elaborate decorations on the sandals which, he says, consisted of a Centauromachy depicted, no doubt in relief, along the sandal edges. Considering the scale of the statue and the proximity of the goddess's feet to the onlooker, this decoration must have been more accessible to view, and therefore of greater importance, than many other details of the work. The Centauromachy theme recurred in the decoration of the temple itself, being the subject of the south side metopes. The mythical scenes of the monstrous Centaurs fighting the Lapiths might be interpreted as representing the Persians fighting the Greeks or, more generally, barbaric forces against civilization and order. From the later reflections of the statue it seems that the soles followed the line of the foot and curved inwards between the first two toes.300 Traces of the thongs have for the most part disappeared completely, suggesting that they were depicted in paint.

Some works following the scheme of the Athena Parthenos attempt to show that there were relief decorations on the sides of the soles, as Pliny says there were, but these are generally simple motifs such as braids.302 This is hardly surprising considering the small scale of the copies. Attempts have been made to identify copies of the sandal Centauromachy in later works. Possible candidates include a marble relief in the Lateran and a marble vase with relief decoration in Madrid (Fig. 6.28).303 Both of these works seem to come from the same original and they may well echo the Pheidian sandals. The Lateran relief measures 0.33m in height, and this may reflect the height of the original sole. Weber has made a comparison of the foot fragments from the copy of the Athena Parthenos originally in Priene and the Baiae cast fragments of the feet of three Amazons, identified by Landwehr.304 The Amazons are generally attributed to Polykleitos, Pheidias and Kresilas on the basis of Pliny, NH 34.53, but there is little agreement about which type belongs to which artist and it is partly to settle this matter that Weber makes her comparison. She suggests that the Mattei foot type is similar to that of the so-called Diomedes of Cumae in Naples, a work which is attributed by some to Kresilas.305 She likens the Sciarra foot to the feet of the Doryphoros and Diadoumenos of Polykleitos and she likens the Sosikles foot type to the Priene feet. On this basis, Weber accepts the Sosikles Amazon type as being by Pheidias, an idea apparently supported by the testimony of Lucian, Imag. 4-6. Further, she compares the Priene foot type with a foot from the Parthenon pediments306 and suggests that there may have been a Pheidian foot mould. The similarities between the Priene left foot and the Sosikles right foot are clearly seen if one compares photos of each, as given by Carter and Landwehr.307 The Priene little toe does not, however, turn inwards as much as the Sosikles little toe, and in this respect it seems perhaps closer to the Mattei little toe. It is interesting to note that the Priene left foot is stylistically very close to a colossal foot fragment in Berlin, which belongs to a 3rd century BC statue from Pergamon. Too little remains of this work, however, to ascertain whether or not it imitated the Athena Parthenos type (Figs. 6.26 and 6.27).308 301 The Gortyn statue, cat. no.

It can therefore be concluded that the spear, serpent and shield were all on the same side, that is the goddess's left side, as Ampelius, 8.10, makes clear. Pliny confirms that the serpent was set at the base of the spear and he adds that a sphinx - presumably that on the helmet - was under its very tip.311 As one would expect, therefore, the spear was held vertically, probably at a slight angle, and it was somewhat taller than the statue itself, which measured some 10.5m without the base, though not much taller, given the constraints of the total height of the naos. Ampelius's text is unfortunately quite corrupt and there is some difficulty about the description he gives of the material of the spear, but it was probably made of gilded bronze. As mentioned above, Pausanias says that Athena held the spear. Ampelius specifies that the goddess's shield rested on the ground and that Athena's left hand touched the rim of the shield with one finger. This description is probably not quite correct, but it does at least strengthen the idea that the left arm was lowered, with the hand touching the shield rim. If this was the case, then the spear was either not held in the hand at all or merely supported by Athena's thumb, and it must have been steadied by the statue at shoulder level. There may be a reference to the Athena Parthenos and her spear in Anth. Plan. 170 by Hermodoros, but this is not certain. In many works of Parthenos type the spear is not included. This can usually be explained in terms of their technique or format. But an interesting detail suggesting how the spear was supported at shoulder level can perhaps be gleaned from the Aspasios gem and a terracotta medallion in the Agora Museum in Athens (Figs. 6.20 and 6.29).312 In both these works the spear is shown resting on the left shoulder of the goddess, and held in place by the coil of an aegis serpent. (H) SERPENT Pliny lists the serpent, along with the Nike and the sphinx, as one of the three features of the composition which were particularly admired by experts.313 The material of the snake is not known for certain but it is possible that it was made of gilded bronze. The serpent is generally shown rearing up in an alert and aggressive pose, its head facing out towards the spectator, and the body forming an intricate mass of coils beneath. The Varvakeion and Patras statuettes agree concerning the disposition of the large coils, but they differ in their tails, the tail of the Patras statuette snake ending in a complicated knot.314 309 Maximus, Dial. 8.6. 310 Pausanias, 1.24.7. 311 Pliny, NH. 36.19. 312 T 3519, Leipen (1971) fig. 51. 313 Pliny, NH 36.19. 314 See Weber (1993) 117.</page><page sequence="112">ATHENA PARTHENOS 93 Pausanias states that the serpent, which he thinks might be Erichthonios, was positioned near the shaft of the goddess's spear.315 From this information it is clear that he saw the serpent at Athena's left side, between her and the shield. And it is in this position that the serpent is represented in a number of works echoing the Parthenos composition.316 From a technical point of view, the serpent may have been an essential support for the enormous shield that stood on the ground by the goddess and was only lightly grasped by her left hand. On the supposition that, in this position, the serpent would have obscured the view of the Gigantomachy on the inner surface of the shield, and that in several of the earlier representations of the composition the serpent is shown on the right side of the goddess, Camp suggests that perhaps the serpent was originally intended to stand on the goddess's right side, to balance the shield, and it was only when it became clear that a column was needed to support the Nike on Athena's right hand that the serpent was moved to the left side.317 When this change might have been made is not specified but, given the evidence of reliefs, it cannot have been later than the first half of the 4th century BC (Figs. 6.30-31). This view presupposes that the column was not an integral part of the composition from the outset, a point which is discussed in section 5 of this chapter, along with the Nike. The presence of Erichthonios in the Parthenos composition is appropriate in several ways. He was a legendary king of Athens, supposedly a son in snake form of Hephaistos and Ge. He was, therefore, an autochthonous Athenian figure and, as a child, he was entrusted to Athena's care. She brought him up in her precinct. When he became king of Athens, he set up a wooden image of the goddess on the Akropolis and he founded the Panathenaic festival. His attachment to the goddess is shown in the way he fiercely stands guard next to her. His threatening manner reinforces the warlike qualities of the goddess herself. At the same time, as an autochthonous being, he aptly represents Athens in the composition: Athens holds a special place in the affections of the goddess, who will be ready to defend the city from all enemies. It is the serpent's specifically Athenian dimension which made it dispensable to artists using the Parthenos scheme outside Attica. Hence the noticeable absence of the serpent in many Roman versions of the type, as well as on coins from, for example, Asia Minor. 315 Pausanias, 1.24.7. 316 See, for example, the Varvakeion, Lenormant, Belgrade and Patras statuettes, cat. nos.

That Pausanias fails to mention the Gigantomachy in his brief description of the Athena Parthenos is perhaps not as significant as sometimes suggested. Pausanias also fails to mention the Amazonomachy of the outer surface and the Centauromachy of the sandal edges. His description of the Parthenos is far from detailed.</page><page sequence="113">94 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 6.3. THE SHIELD (A) THE AMAZONOMACHY The design which figured on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos is the one part of the statue which may be reconstructed with some degree of confidence. Its subject, as stated by Pliny and Plutarch, was an Amazonomachy: the legendary storming of the Akropolis by the Amazons, in which Theseus led the Greeks to victory.318 It was composed of small groups of figures, set roughly two deep around the central gorgoneion, mostly arranged as pairs of duelling fighters. Certain small-scale representations of the whole composition have survived, most of them only in fragmentary form (Figs 6.32-37). In addition, a number of Roman reliefs, known as the Piraeus reliefs, which mostly show duelling pairs, copy some of the shield figures (Figs. 6.42-43; 46-50; 52-61). Individual figures have also been identified on sarcophagi fragments from Aphrodisias. As Pausanias reveals, the shield was copied from at least as early as the later 2nd century BC.319 Strocka dated the Vatican copy to the 1st century BC.320 The following have been dated to the Antonine period: the Piraeus reliefs; the Patras shield; the Conservatori replica and the Aphrodisias fragments.321 The Lenormant statuette is more difficult to date, partly because it is unfinished, but Harrison thinks that at any rate it follows an earlier tradition than the Strangford shield.322 The same probably applies to the Agora fragment. The Strangford shield was probably made in the 3rd century AD.323 "In s cuto eius Amazonum proelium caelaviť recorded Pliny (NH, 36.18). The material used for the shield figures is not known for certain, but to judge from the Piraeus copies, they were probably in high relief and they may have been gilded bronze appliqués. A vase which may reflect the high relief of the decoration is St Petersburg, 1792.324 Independent replicas of the shield figures agree in iconography and size. This suggests that sculptors were able to make casts of individual figures and use these as models to make their copies. It also explains why copyists felt free to select figures and alter the composition as they needed. On the basis that a real shield was about 0.90m in diameter, Weber estimates that the Parthenos shield must have measured about 5.40m in diameter.325 The decorated part within the rim would have measured about 4.80m. The shield figures were about half life- size measuring some two cubits in height. The figures from the Piraeus reliefs, which are 318 Pliny, NH, 36. 18; Plutarch, Per. 31.3.

Concerning the position of the figures on the shield, many conjectures have been made. Some figures, and even whole groups, retain the same relative position on several copies. It can therefore be assumed with confidence that this was their position in the original composition. Other figures are more difficult to place. Some of the best reconstructions offered so far are those of Meyer, S trocka and Harrison (Figs. 6.38-40) and, of these, perhaps the most convincing is that presented by Meyer.326 This reconstruction has the virtue of both weeding out doublet figures introduced by copyists and of making the actions of each group intelligible. Meyer published a relief in Munich, which belongs within the group of the Piraeus reliefs (Fig. 6.41). The scene depicted shows an Amazon, who is sinking on to her knees and trying to touch with her right hand the wound at the back of her neck, caused by the Greek attacking her from behind. On the relief, the Greek is shown wielding an axe, but Meyer argues that the movement of the Greek man's cloak, the position of his arms, as well as the position of the Amazon's right arm and hand all make much better sense if one supposes that, in the original, the Greek held a spear with which he was shown stabbing the Amazon in the neck. Meyer argues that the axe is an alteration made by the copyist for his own reasons, mostly to do with the angle from which his relief copy was going to be seen.327 The Amazon was copied several times, notably on the Strangford shield and one of the Aphrodisias sarcophagi, but in these cases the figure has been rotated by forty-five degrees so that the Amazon appears to be lying dead on the ground. In the case of the Strangford shield she thus figures as the female counterpart of the dead Greek at the bottom of the shield and as the victim of the Greek with his arm in front of his face. But there is no Amazon lying dead on the Lenormant, Patras and Agora copies (Figs. 6.32, 36 and 37), nor does she occur on any of the Piraeus reliefs. And even on the Strangford shield, where the dead Amazon does figure, there is only one dead body, not two. Therefore, Meyer rejects the Strangford-Aphrodisias Amazon as a variant of the Munich type.328 The fact that the position of the legs and the pose of the right arm are not appropriate to someone who is dead confirm the value of the testimony of the Munich relief. The Munich relief thus gets rid of the second dead body at the bottom of the shield, which is favoured by Harrison and Strocka and several others, and restores this Amazon to her rightful place as the victim of the striding Greek.329 The Greek of the Munich relief was also copied several times. He can be recognized on the Conservatori fragment, though his cloak has been abbreviated to a scabbard here and he is holding an axe. The Conservatori fragment is valuable because it indicates the relative position of the Munich pair on the shield: in the lower left quadrant of the composition. On the Strangford shield, the Greek stands at the bottom of the composition, to the left of the so-called Perikles figure, again swinging an axe. In both these examples, the position 326 Meyer (1987) 295-321. 327 Meyer (1987) 298 and 304-05. 328 Meyer (1987) 301. 329 Harrison (1981) 283, ill. 1, fig. no. 3; Strocka (1984) 194, fig. 5, no. 11.</page><page sequence="115">96 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS of the left arm has been altered to accommodate the axe. On the Copenhagen relief, the man is seen fighting against a figure known from a number of copies to have been male, not female as in this copy. This young warrior was the duelling partner of an Amazon wielding an axe. The Chiaramonti shield shows the upper half of this figure, and the lower half is preserved on the Conservatori fragment. On the strength of the Conservatori, Strangford and Copenhagen copies, many scholars give an axe to the Munich Greek type.330 Strocka even adds an axe-man, while arming the Munich Greek type with a sword.331 Meyer, however, is surely right to suggest that an axe-man would be no more than a doublet of the Amazon swinging an axe, and that the Munich Greek, with his tell- tale arm positions, argues in favour of a spear as the weapon of the original of this fighter. The fact that the Conservatori and Strangford shields included the axe suggests that they were not copied directly from the original shield. This may not prove very surprising, especially in the case of the Strangford shield which is notoriously unreliable. If Meyer is correct in this line of argument, then the Munich relief gets rid of Strocka' s axe-man, mentioned above. The direct consequence of removing the axe-man is that the axe-man's victim also evaporates. This is a figure for which there is little evidence: it relies solely on the kneeling figure at the bottom of the Strangford shield.332 Sorting out the actions, poses and position of the figures on the Munich relief has repercussions on the group at the base of the shield, for it suggests that there is no dead Amazon at the bottom of the shield. On the left is the well-known 'pilos-wearer', seen on the Patras and Lenormant shields, as well as on a fragment of a Piraeus relief (Fig. 6.42).333 He held a shield in his left hand and was pointing a spear with his right. At his feet lay the well-documented figure of the dead Greek.334 The characteristic v-shaped position of the left arm renders this figure easily recognizable. Next to the 'pilos-wearer' was another figure, seen on the Patras, Strangford and Agora shields and the Piraeus fragment from Salamis (Fig. 6.43).335 The 'pilos-wearer' was aiming his spear at a figure in front of him, who has just slain the Greek and initially tries to run away (hence the movement of the legs), but then thinks better of it and attempts to retaliate with a powerful swing of the right arm, which must originally have held a sword. The figure on the right is surely best understood as an Amazon and not a Greek. Confirmation of the figure's identity is probably provided by the presence of an Amazon in exactly the same pose on the Nikopolis statue base relief, which has several Pheidian figures (Fig. 6.44).336 The poses of the 'pilos wearer' and his opponent are reused on the 4th century Heroon of 330 So Harrison (1981) fig. no. 24. 331 Strocka (1984) fig. nos. 13 and 23. 332 Strocka (1984) 194, fig. no. 12. 333 Strocka (1967a) 91, fig. 38. 334 See the Patras, Lenormant and Agora shields (cat. nos.

He says that the shield Amazonomachy bore portraits of both Pheidias and Perikles. Pheidias, he says, is the bald old man hurling a stone and Perikles is the warrior holding a spear in front of his face. Because the Strangford shield shows an apparently bald Greek with his hands held high above his head next to a Greek with his face partially covered by his raised right arm at the bottom of the shield, it has often been thought that this copyist intended to reproduce the two 'portraits' side by side at the bottom of the shield. Thus, he understood the figure on the right as Perikles and the figure on the left as Pheidias. Several scholars have followed this lead, interpreting the figure on the right as Perikles and seeing the left figure as at least derived from the 'Pheidias' type, even though it is generally agreed that 'Pheidias' was placed at the top of the shield, as on the Lenormant shield. It is possible that the left figure of the Strangford shield is derived from the stone-thrower, as far as arm positions is concerned, though the short cloak seems to copy that of the Munich Greek type. But the right figure of the Strangford shield is an Amazon and, as can be seen from the other copies, her face was not covered by her arm in the original composition. The slight raising of the arm position on the Strangford shield could be an alteration made by the copyist in order to accommodate the anecdote found in Plutarch. The same may be true of the baldness of the left figure, who is otherwise a normal Greek warrior, and also of his weapon: the axe is perhaps meant to make one think of the god of craftsmen, Hephaistos.338 On the other hand, it has also been suggested that the Strangford axe-man is not bald, his hair loss due to no more than an unfortunate chip in the marble. The two figures which come closest to Plutarch's descriptions are the pilos-wearer at the bottom of the Patras and Lenormant shields and the stone-thrower at the top of the Lenormant shield. It seems probable that the identification of the pilos-wearer with Perikles is no more than an anecdote, which may have grown out of the simple fact that the spearman was wearing a pilos. He is the only Greek in the composition to wear one, thus making him easily recognizable, and it was a well-known fact that Perikles had a particularly tall skull.339 If Perikles could be 'recognized' on the shield, it was a short step to recognizing Pheidias too. Turning to the 'stone-thrower', with whom Plutarch equates Pheidias, it is clear that several problems surround this figure. As stated above, the Strangford shield is not helpful, for the figure in question, who wields an axe, seems to be an adaptation of the Munich Greek type. This leaves the Lenormant shield. It is difficult to know how far this piece, which was left unfinished, can be trusted. In general, the level of detail and accuracy on the Lenormant shield is not very high. The stone-thrower appears at the top of the Lenormant shield, apparently wearing an exomis, the short tunic typical of an artisan. There is no other evidence to support the idea that the stone-thrower, alone amongst all the other Greek fighters, was wearing such a costume; this detail, therefore, should be treated with caution. It should be noted that the related figure of the Greek on the Copenhagen 337 See Meyer (1987) 307, fig. 4. 338 So Harrison (1981) 294. 339 See Plutarch, Per. 3. 2 and 13. 6.</page><page sequence="117">98 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEDDIAS relief is simply wearing a chlamys. Harrison suggests that the exomis may have been added by the copyist to make it clear that the figure was an artist, for the baldness of the head - which Plutarch mentions - might not have been very noticeable in such a small- scale copy.340 But whether or not the Lenormant stone-thrower has a beard and hair is not clear either: contrary to her earlier view, Harrison thinks he has not, but Meyer thinks he has.341 Plutarch certainly says that the stone-thrower was bald, and he attributes the baldness to the age of the person in question, whom he describes as old. But, as Fehr points out, this explanation is weak for the actions of the man denote physical strength.342 Fehr regards the baldness, along with the exomis, as typical of an artisan.343 Thus, according to him, a very unusual scene results: an artisan, traditionally despised by the aristocratic class, is shown fighting alongside Greek heroes, and, what is more, he fights with a stone, a weapon often reserved for barbarians and uncivilized beings such as Centaurs and Maenads. Fehr interprets the scene as a provocative political statement, aimed at showing the central and positive role of crafts and craftsmen in the contemporary radical democracy of Athens. This interpretation surely goes too far. It should be remembered that using a stone as a weapon was not just restricted to barbarians and uncivilized beings. Rocks were used as weapons by Greeks in the Iliad , when there were no other weapons to hand, as well as by Athenians defending the Akropolis against the Persians in 480 BC.344 The rock is also a weapon of Athena herself occasionally and of Poseidon. On the Nikopolis relief showing a Pheidian-style Amazonomachy, Theseus is shown hurling a stone.345 It is also probable that the exomis is a copyist's addition. One is left with the testimony of Plutarch that the stone-thrower was bald, a detail Plutarch was hardly likely to have made up. It is possible, but not certain, that this would have identified the man as an artisan. It would be interesting to find some positive archaeological evidence to strengthen Plutarch's testimony, and to show that the figure he saw formed part of the original composition. The literary evidence for the shield portraits and the related matter of the shield destruction mechanism is considered separately, below. It suggests that these are both anecdotes that cannot be traced back further than Hellenistic times. It seems certain that if the shield had included genuine portraits of these two men then they would have been copied, and this is not the case. Putting a famous name to an unknown figure was common practice in antiquity.346 To return to the shield composition. Two groups which do not cause any particular problem for the reconstruction are the hair-pulling group (Figs. 6.46-48) and the 'Greek 340 Harrison (1981) 294. 341 For Harrison's first thesis, see Harrison (1966) 113.

The former appears in the lower right quadrant of the Lenormant, Strangford, Patras and Agora shields (Figs. 6.32-33, 36-37). It also appears on at least three Piraeus reliefs. The 'Greek helper' group, which is shown on at least two Piraeus reliefs, figures above the hair-pulling group on the Patras shield. On the Strangford shield it is placed on the left side of the shield and the figures have been changed into Amazons. As noted earlier, the Strangford shield cannot be relied upon without supporting evidence. Since there is none in this case, it is probable that there was no Amazon helper group of this sort on the left side of the shield and that the Patras shield is correct in placing the group in the lower right quadrant. Even if not very detailed, the Patras shield does appear to retain faithfully the relative positions of the figures. According to Meyer, the next group consisted of three figures, which occupied the central part of the right half of the composition.347 Under attack was a naked Greek, crouching behind his shield. He can be seen on the Patras, Lenormant and Strangford shields, as well as on a Piraeus relief, which clearly shows his tense, stationary pose (Fig. 6.50).348 This figure seems to be echoed in a relief fragment sometimes associated with the frieze of the Ilissos temple (Fig. 6.51). 349 The naked warrior holds a shield in his left hand and steps on a rock with his raised left foot, but in this case he crouches down for his adversary is shown to be on the same level as he is. A similar motif is taken up several times in the frieze of the temple of Athena Nike: see figure 9 on block o and figure 3 on block a of the south frieze, and figure 3 of block i of the west frieze.350 Close by and attacking with a spear was an Amazon, seen from the back and kneeling on her right knee (Fig. 6.52). She is seen on the Patras, Lenormant and Strangford shields, though on the last example her pose has been completely misunderstood by the copyist and he has changed her weapon into an axe. She also figures on at least one Piraeus relief. Slightly above these two figures was another Amazon attacking with a spear. This figure can be seen on the Patras and Strangford shields. Harrison regards this as a "descending Greek" but the panther skin of the Patras shield identifies the figure as an Amazon.351 It is likely that the group of three has been wrongly interpreted partly because in both the Patras and Strangford shields an Amazon, who probably belongs slightly higher in the composition, appears to have slipped down between the Greek ducking behind his shield and the Amazon wearing a panther skin. She has therefore been interpreted as the target of the supposed "descending Greek". This Amazon is Harrison's figure no. 11. But the Amazon seen attacking uphill, known from numerous Piraeus reliefs, as well as the Strangford and Patras shields, is the target of the archer wearing a chlamys (Figs. 6.53-55). No doubt these two figures would have been set further apart on the original than they appear on any of the copies. The Amazon was probably holding a shield, as she is shown in most, though not all, of the copies. Her weapon was probably not a spear, as some of the copies suggest, for this does not suit the position of her right hand of which 347 Meyer (1987) 308ff. 348 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 20. 349 ANM inv. 3941, side 2; see Picón (1978) fig. 10. 350 Ridgway (1981) figs. 57, 58, and 59. 351 Harrison (1981) 283, fig. no. 10.</page><page sequence="119">1 00 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the spectator sees the back of the fist, but something short such as a sword or, as Meyer prefers, an axe.352 Another well-attested group is the so-called 'Kapaneus' group, set in the upper right quadrant of the shield, above the group of three fighters (Figs. 6.56 and 6.57). A Greek, who has fallen on his right knee after being wounded in the back, is about to be attacked by an Amazon coming up to him with a sword. The figure of the Greek was clearly much admired for it features on at least three Piraeus reliefs. His position almost at the top of the shield is clear from the Patras and Strangford shields. The group which occupied the upper left quadrant of the shield was the largest group, being composed of at least six figures. The Chiaramonti fragment shows three Amazons, all holding shields (Fig. 6.34). One is falling back, the next is running downhill, while the third is going up, armed with her sword, to attack the stone-throwing Greek above them. That there was another Amazon seated to the right and below the stone-thrower is apparent from the Patras and Strangford shields. This figure also appears on Piraeus relief 2112 (Fig. 6.58). The dead Amazon, with her head hanging down, was probably placed directly underneath the stone-throwing Greek, in the midst of the other Amazons, as Strocka maintains (Fig. 6.59).353 This accords with her position on the Strangford shield, even though the whole group has been moved downwards on this copy. Such a position, away from the edge of the shield also accords with the sketchy rendering of this figure on the Lenormant shield. Harrison includes a second Greek in this group.354 But there is little evidence for such a figure, and it is doubtful that there would have been any room for him in the place Harrison assigns him. Directly below this group comes the axe group, composed of a youthful Greek (known from several Piraeus reliefs), with a shield and spear, defending himself from an Amazon attacking him with an axe (Figs. 6.60-61). As mentioned earlier, the Amazon is known from the Chiaramonti and Conservatori fragments, each of which conveniently preserves one half of the figure (Figs. 6.34-35). The whole figure also appears on an Amazon sarcophagus in the Capitoline Museum.355 The final group, below the Munich relief pair discussed above, shows a Greek warrior standing behind a half kneeling Amazon, touching her back with his right hand. It has often been wondered whether he is stabbing her in the back or helping her to remove an arrow or a spear from her back. Meyer is convinced that he is helping her and, therefore, that she is the friendly Antiope.356 Her position is not one of flight: with her two hands she clutches at the back of her neck and her left leg is folded so that she can sit on it. The way the Greek has set his right foot on a rock and the way he leans forward slightly suggests that he is pulling at something with his right hand. Meyer suggests that Antiope was shot by the Amazon in the Munich relief group, just above, whom he identifies as Molpadia, and that she is now being assisted by Theseus. These identifications have to be treated with caution. For not only is there no overwhelming evidence for the recognition of 352 Meyer (1987) 311. 353 Strocka (1984) 194, fig. 5. 354 Harrison (1981) fig. no. 18. 355 See Meyer (1987) 314, fig. 5. 356 Meyer (1987) 315-16.</page><page sequence="120">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 0 1 Theseus in the figure of the Greek warrior, but also it is not at all clear that the story of the friendly Amazon, killed by one of her own side, existed in the 5th century BC. The story of the rape of Antiope by Theseus - as an independent adventure by this hero - certainly goes back to the Archaic period, when it was often depicted on vase paintings. This event was seen as the cause of the Amazon invasion of Attica, a story which is first attested no earlier than the 460s BC. But the sources for the friendly Amazon story are considerably later than this: Pausanias says that, according to Hegias of Troizen - probably of Hellenistic date - Antiope fell in love with Theseus when he was helping Herakles fight the Amazons at Themiskyra, and that the Athenian version of the story has it that Antiope was later killed by Molpadia when the Amazons attacked the city; Diodorus Siculus gives Antiope the same role.357 Isokrates, on the other hand, says that Hippolyte fell in love with Theseus, went with him to Athens and lived with him as his consort, and that it was for this reason that the Amazons attacked Athens; Plutarch says that Hippolyte fought for Theseus and that she was either fatally wounded by Molpadia, or, according to another version of the story, she married Theseus.358 The story cannot be traced back further than Isokrates it seems, and there is no record either of a friendly Amazon or of Molpadia on any vase paintings of the 6th or 5th centuries BC. The only evidence is then the small and rather unclear copy of the shield group on the Conservatori fragment. But that the details shown on this fragment cannot be accepted as correct without further evidence has been shown above in connection with the Munich Greek type. Comparison may be made with the group on the late Hellenistic Nikopolis relief, which apparently shows an Amazon being stabbed in the back by a Greek.359 The figure of the Greek is rather damaged, but his pose seems similar to that of 'Theseus'. And yet the copyist has given him a different Amazon partner, and one whose pose and action make it clear that the Greek is indeed killing the Amazon in front of him in this case. For the Amazon is already sinking to her knees under the impact of the wound, while her body arches back in pain and her right hand tries to reach the cause of her distress. This Amazon appears to be a hybrid of two of the shield figures: her pose is very similar to that of the Amazon in the so-called 'death- leap' group, but the movement of the right arm belongs to the Amazon of the Munich group. According to this reconstruction, there were several fewer fighters on the shield than previously thought: twelve Greeks and fourteen Amazons, making a total of twenty-six figures in all, perhaps thirteen combatants on each side, if one accepts the Antiope/Hippolyte identification. In addition to rejecting the dead Amazon and the kneeling Greek, already mentioned, Meyer also discards Harrison's Amazon helper group.360 The evidence that such a group featured on the shield is weak. The Lenormant figures which Harrison takes as a vague copy of this group seem to refer to the Antiope group, which is well attested, while the Strangford figures represent the Greek helper group transposed to the other side of the shield. It is probable that the figures were deliberately set at some distance from the upper left edge of the shield so that they would not get in the 357 Pausanias, 1.2.1; Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist.

On the whole, the figures are arranged in pairs, but there were also two groups of three and one group of six. The figures are usually set two deep around the shield, and in several cases the inner person faces out towards the edge of the shield. There is very little overlapping of figures. The scene is set when the battle is raging fiercely all about. The fact that the shield of the Parthenos depicted the Athenian Amazonomachy, the first foreign invasion of Attica, in which Theseus led the Athenians to victory, is reported by Pausanias.361 He also states that the same war was depicted on two Athenian murals, perhaps both by Mikon, in the Theseion and the Stoa Poikile. These works dated from around 470 BC and around 460 BC, respectively. Boardman draws attention to the novelty of this version of the Amazon story during the early Classical period.362 Herakles's exploits against the Amazons were often used as a subject for Archaic art. And from the late 6th century BC to around 480 BC Theseus becomes associated with the Amazons through the story of his rape of Antiope, sometimes with the help of his friend Peirithous. This appears to be an independent episode, unconnected with Herakles's Amazonomachies.363 Theseus 's collaboration with Herakles in an expedition against the Amazons, to which the Antiope episode was later attached, first appears in Greek art on metope 8 of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi, which probably dates from the 490s BC or a little later, where Theseus is shown killing an Amazon. In literature, there is no evidence for such a link between the two heroes until about 430 BC.364 The Athenian Amazonomachy story, which had the Amazons invade Attica, in order to rescue Antiope or avenge her rape, and then meet a crushing defeat at the hands of Theseus, cannot be traced back further than about 470 BC, either in art or literature. As mentioned above, Pausanias refers to the murals by Mikon, but he does not describe them at all. Then there is the shield of the Parthenos, which was completed by 438 BC. On vases, Theseus is first positively indicated in this context from the 450s BC. Although purporting to report a speech of 479 BC, Herodotus, writing in about the 450s BC, mentions the Athenian defeat of the Amazons in Attica.365 In a play produced in 458 BC, Aeschylus mentions the Amazonian camp on the Areopagus.366 Pausanias, VII.2.4, also says that Pindar alludes to the Amazonian expedition against Theseus at Athens. Certain important points emerge from this. Firstly, the new interest in Theseus in Amazonomachy scenes seems to date from the time when the Herakles Amazonomachies begin to grow less popular. This is surely to be explained in terms of the developing role of Theseus as hero of the new democracy of Athens, as against Herakles's similar role under the Peisistratid tyranny at Athens. Secondly, the fact that the idea of an Amazon invasion in retaliation for previous Athenian actions cannot be traced earlier than the 460s BC perhaps indicates, as Boardman suggests, that it was created after the Persian attacks and defeats of 490 BC and 480/479 361 Pausanias, 1.17.2. 362 Boardman (1982) 5ff. 363 See Boardman (1982) 8-9, and nn. 25-30. 364 Euripides, Herakleidai , 215ff. 365 Herodotus, IX.27. 366 Aeschylus, Eum. 685-89.</page><page sequence="122">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 03 BC, as a parallel for relations between the Athenians and the Persians during that period.367 Boardman further suggests that the seeds for this idea were sown in the sculptural programme of the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi.368 Theseus was shown fighting an Amazon in metope 8 on the south side of the building, the most conspicuous side, while Herakles was shown fighting an Amazon on the north side. For the first time, Theseus is seen helping Herakles fight the Amazons, a conflict which took place in the east and which allegedly led to the retreat of the Amazons as far as Ephesos.369 As the story developed, in the 5th century BC and later, the role of Theseus in Herakles's Amazonomachy later resulted in the Amazon attack on Attica. In political terms, this could be seen as a reference to the Athenian expedition to Ephesos in 499 BC to help the Ionian revolt and their raid on Sardis,370 and the Persians' subsequent desire to punish the Athenians on their own ground. The multi-level composition of the Amazonomachy, as well as many of the figure poses, make it clear that the shield was adorned with background scenery, probably rendered in low relief. This does not appear on the surviving small-scale copies of the shield, where it may have been added in paint. Evidence for the background is present, however, on the Piraeus reliefs, where one can sometimes see a rocky groundline, or separate rocks, and sometimes even parts of buildings, walls and the tops of columns (Figs. 6.47-48; 49; and 60). The Ampurias relief, cat. no. (6) 155, also has rocky mounds. Such elements are needed to make sense of a large proportion of the poses, for rarely does a figure stand with both feet planted at the same level. Many of the figures have one foot set at a higher level than the other: take, for instance, the Greek behind 'Antiope', the Munich Greek, the stone-thrower, the hair-pulling group Greek, and the Amazon drawing her sword against 'Kapaneus'. Two Amazons in the stone-thrower group appear to be seated on something, while both the spear-throwing Amazons in the group of three fighters are kneeling on their right knees, with the left foot set lower down. The Munich Amazon is also on her knees. In her reconstruction, Harrison interprets the background as the very precise depiction of the place where the artist imagines the combat to have taken place (Fig. 6.40).371 In her opinion, this was on the slopes of the Akropolis and, in addition to vague rocks, she suggests that there were also walls, towers, a moat, cliffs, the temple of Athena itself - visible at the top - and various scaling ladders, used by the Amazons to get to the citadel. The shape of the shield, with the figures rising to the top, lends itself in certain respects to the depiction of a fight on steeply rising ground, and indeed the Piraeus reliefs go some way to providing evidence for the presence of walls and towers in the composition. See, in particular, Piraeus relief copies of the hair-pulling and pilos-wearer groups. Ridgway points out that further support for the presence of walls in the composition may come from the Amazonomachy on a large volute krater by the Niobid 367 Boardman (1982) 14. 368 Boardman (1982) 12-13. 369 Pausanias, VII.2.4. 370 Herodotus, V.97-103. 371 Harrison (1981) 294ff. and ill. 4.</page><page sequence="123">1 04 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS painter, published by Arias.372 On side B of this vase an Amazon is shown retreating behind a wall. This detail is highly unusual and its importance should not be overlooked. It is likely then that Harrison's picture is not far from the truth. The sight of walls, as well as hilly ground, certainly suggests a city location, and the undoubted parallels being made between the Persian attacks on Attica and the Amazon attack of mythology would make an Akropolis setting for the battle very appropriate. But whether the artist sought to represent a real location through specific details remains uncertain. The low relief background elements were no doubt intended to give further pictorial interest to the composition, and to provide a setting for varied figure poses and complex groups. Such extensive use of background would have been quite unusual and innovative for the period and it probably went some way beyond the trends set in the early Classical period by such painters as Polygnotos and Mikon, from whom, or at least in whose medium, the idea for multi-level compositions seems to have had its origins. A study of Greek vases illustrating Amazonomachies reveals that, in early examples, the general scheme consisted of duelling pairs, with the weakening fighter collapsing on to his knees and the stronger fighter shown in a striding position. Heads were always shown in profile. Figures all occupied the same ground level. Sometimes a dead or dying figure was shown on the ground, with adversaries fighting above them. Several of these traditional features are familiar from the shield Amazonomachy also, showing that Pheidias was well acquainted with the work of painters. A black-figure dinos from the second quarter of the 6th century BC, shows Herakles striding to the right towards an Amazon, with a dying Greek at his feet (Fig. 6.62).373 Although different in many respects, this fragment provides a parallel for the pose of the pilos-wearer who stands above a dead comrade. The black-figure neck amphora in Philadelphia, no. MS 5467, illustrates the common motif of Herakles striding forwards, with his left foot raised, clutching an Amazon by the helmet with his left hand and with his right hand holding a sword that is ready to lunge forwards (Fig. 6.63).374 The pose of the hair-pulling Greek is surely related to this type, even if many of the details have been changed and the pose of the Amazon is entirely different. A shield figure who looks like a modernized version of a traditional type is that of the Amazon running downhill while looking behind her in the group of six in the top left quadrant of the shield. The Amazon shown running on flat ground but with her head turned right back to see what is happening behind her appears on many black-figure vases.375 From the second quarter of the 5th century BC, Polygnotos of Thasos and the Athenian painter Mikon became renowned for the creation of large mural friezes, painted on wooden panels, which were displayed in various stoas and sanctuaries in Athens and Delphi. Amazonomachies figured in the Stoa Poikile at Athens as well as the Theseion, which was built after Kimon conquered Skyros (474-473 BC) and brought back to Athens the bones of Theseus. It is possible that they were both by Mikon. According to Pausanias, the 372 Ridgway (1981) 166, n. 10; Arias (1980) 51-55. 373 Athens, Kerameikos 76.

In addition, some of the figures were half hidden, behind rocks or walls, and rocks were used to support certain figure poses. These features seem to have had a marked influence on Pheidias's work. Whether they were all innovations of the muralists seems doubtful, however, for some of them occur on rare, surviving paintings of earlier date. A clay plaque from Pente Skouphia, near Corinth, for example, dating from the first quarter of the 6th century BC, shows a section through a clay-pit, with men working inside the pit at various levels and using the sides of the pit to support themselves (Fig. 6.64).378 From the 460s BC the murals started to affect vase painting, albeit in a limited way. The composition of both sides of the name vase of the Niobid Painter is very distinctive, with its rocky groundline and figures disposed above and below in a frieze the height of approximately one and a half figures (Figs. 6.65-66).379 The multi-level arrangement and rocky groundlines with daring figure groups were favoured for battle scenes and they often occur in Amazonomachy scenes. Another good example is the volute krater by the Painter of Woolly Satyrs (Figs. 6.67-68).380 Here one can see a fluctuating groundline, a cut-off figure, and some unusual poses, although in this case the frieze is only one figure high. Paintings such as the Seven against Thebes in Ferrara, and the Amazonomachy by the Painter of Bologna 279 (Fig. 6.69) perhaps reflect the large murals, only here the crowding and the overlapping of figures are surely due to the restrictions imposed by the size of the field.381 They make the picture very busy and rather unclear. Given the much smaller scale and format of vase painting, it is probably right to doubt that the vases give any close insight into the now lost murals. Barron's observant analysis of the Niobid painter's name- vase, however, in particular of certain mannerisms and preferences in poses, clearly demonstrates that this painter and others whose works show similar features were influenced by one of the great muralists, probably Polygnotos.382 The figure poses and some of the group compositions of the shield have much more in common with the vases illustrating these new trends than anything which went before, and it seems likely that the common denominator behind the shield Amazonomachy and these vases was free painting of the early Classical and Classical periods. The enormous size of the shield lent itself to this medium, even if the circular shape, the convex surface and 376 Pausanias, 1.15.2 and 1.17.2. 377 Pausanias, X.25-31. 378 Berlin, Staatliche Museen, F 871.

And, just as the large murals of the early Classical painters were used for political propaganda, so the Parthenos shield served a similar role. A kalyx krater from Bologna illustrates the depiction of a fully frontal face, with furrows on the brow, as well as a Greek shown in three-quarter back view.383 There were at least two frontal heads on the shield: 'Kapaneus' and the upside down Amazon. Furrowed brows appear on the Parthenon metopes, but the shield figures appear to have worn a calmer expression, more typical of the high Classical period. Three- quarter views are very common on the shield, especially from the front (for example, the 'Antiope' and the hair-pulling group), but also from the back (for example, the upper of the two spear-holding Amazons in the group of three). A kalyx krater in New York, also from the second quarter of the 5th century BC, illustrates in mirror image the pose of the Amazon wielding an axe above her head with both her hands, who figured in the central part of the left half of the shield (Fig. 6.70).384 Like her counterpart on the vase, the shield Amazon wears a short chiton with fine pleats and her inner leg is slightly raised, with the foot placed on higher ground than her other foot. This illustrates an important characteristic of free painting of this period, namely that of using different planes and levels for the figures of the composition. In this respect, the shield is probably much closer to free painting than any vase painting could be, for the shield artist had ample space on the roughly 5m wide shield to spread the groups out and allow different figures to occupy different levels, as well as planes, without having to resort to much overlapping. Returning to the New York vase again, notice the Amazon to the left of the one just described: although the arm positions differ, the leg positions are reminiscent of those of the adversary of the pilos- wearer. Another vase which shows a figure with one foot on a rock is the Agrigento volute krater, AG 8952 (Fig. 6.7 1).385 On the other side there is also an Amazon with an axe raised above her head in both hands. This vase is thought to be an early work of the Niobid painter. A considerably later work by the same artist is the volute krater in Naples, 2421 (Fig. 6. 72). 386 Notice here the crouching Greek with spear and shield. Closely related is the figure of the crouching Greek in the group of three fighters on the central right part of shield. The changes made to the shield figure, so that he is actually standing almost straight, with the left foot raised on to higher ground, and his face peering more gingerly over the rim of his shield, go with the altered group composition, for on the shield he is being attacked by two Amazons situated above him and aiming their spears at him. Turning to the volute krater in New York, probably dating from the end of the second quarter of the 5th century BC, one finds that here too there are three-quarter back views, fully frontal heads, and several other poses which find echoes on the Parthenos shield (Fig. 6.67-Ó8).387 Notice in particular the two-handed axe-wielder;388 Barron convincingly 383 For the kalyx krater, Bologna 289, see Bothmer (1957) 161, no. 1, pl.

The Greek in distinctive black boots is not dissimilar in pose to the hair-pulling Greek and he is shown holding an Amazon by the forearm. Behind this Greek is an Amazon down on one knee in a pose like that of the 'Kapaneus' figure at the top of the shield, though again various changes have been made: the pose of the legs is reversed, 'Kapaneus' holds the shield away from his body and the raised right arm does not hold a weapon but clutches at the wound in the man's back. The group composed of a Greek with a spear and the two Amazons with axes makes an interesting comparison with the axe group of the Parthenos shield. As can be seen from this analysis several shield figures find parallels in certain early Classical vase paintings and these in turn probably echo the great murals of the period, some of which showed Amazonomachies. In Classical vases reflections of some of the shield figure types have been found, but they are not common and, as often observed, while whole groups seem never to have been copied, individual figures are often considerably altered in their details. For example, the pose of the Munich Greek is used for the Amazon with a spear on the squat lekythos, Boston 95.48, while her Greek adversary has a very standard pose, quite unlike that of the Amazon victim of the Munich Greek.390 A figure whose pose approaches that of the Amazon victim can be seen on the lower row of figures on the squat lekythos, New York 31.11.13, though there are changes to the arm and leg movements as well as to the head position (Fig. 6.73).391 On the lekythos, the head is thrown back, the arm positions are inverted and the legs are both fully bent. Again, a completely different adversary has been paired with the figure. The pose of the Greek in the group of three, with one foot raised on a rock, is often shown on later Amazonomachy vases, but reversed so that the figure is seen in three-quarter back view and looking left, and in these cases he is usually set against an Amazon on horseback.392 The figures on the squat lekythos by Aison,393 from around 420 BC, may also be compared with some of the Parthenos shield figures but, as Boardman says, they "do not reproduce the most distinctive and innovative of the relief groups on the shield."394 The wounded Greek with drooping head in the lower register is similar to the wounded Greek in the lower right quadrant of the shield, but on the vase he faces right, the arm movements are different and he has lost his companion. The Greek with a sword in the upper register is reminiscent of the hair-pulling Greek, though he has a shield and helmet. His opponent has the leg pose - though not the arm pose - of the pilos-wearer' s adversary. The Greek with a spear in the upper register has a pose similar to that of the stone-thrower, though he carries a shield on 389 Barron (1972). 390 Boston 95.48; ARV2 1248, no. 2, 1688; Bothmer (1957) 177, no. 30, pl.

On the shield he directly attacks the Amazon going downhill, who is also similar to the equivalent figure on the shield, though there the figure is standing, whereas on the vase she is almost sitting. And the Greek with a spear in the lower register is fairly close to the Greek in the group of three on the shield, but again the adversary on the vase is completely different and the original group composition of the shield is lost. In connection with the possible influence of free painting on the shield composition, it is perhaps relevant to recall the tradition that Pheidias started out as a painter.395 His father, Charmides, is never mentioned as Pheidias 's teacher, which may suggest that he was not a sculptor himself.396 But that Pheidias came from a family of artists is probable, considering that he had at least one brother, or more doubtfully a nephew, who was a painter. According to Pausanias and Pliny, Pheidias's famous contemporary, Panainos, was his brother, as well as being a colleague on some of his projects, notably the Zeus at Olympia.397 Plutarch mentions another brother, Pleistainetos, also a painter, but this name is otherwise unknown and it may very well be a doublet for Panainos.398 At least one painting is connected with Pheidias, that is a shield that was in Athens.399 Although not certain, it is at least possible that this is a reference to the inner surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, which was adorned with a Gigantomachy that may have been executed in paint. Two features of the shield composition which may be singled out as particularly distinctive are the strong diagonal lines of individual poses and, linked with this, the idea of having opponents approach each other not from left and right, as traditionally, but from above or from below. Strong diagonal lines occur, for example, in the poses of the Amazons attacking uphill, the 'Kapaneus' figure, the Amazon wielding an axe, the Munich Greek type and the related pose of the stone-thrower. In the last two cases drapery is strikingly used to reinforce the diagonal thrust of the pose. Turning to group compositions, one does find that some pairs of figures confront each other on the same level, more or less. Take, for example, the pilos-wearer and his Amazon opponent. But in several cases the opponents are placed diagonally, and their poses and weapons accentuate this line. Good examples of this are the archer group towards the top of the shield and the interesting group of three warriors in the middle of the right half of the shield. Parallels for such compositions on vase paintings are not easy to find, but an interesting comparison can be made with a group of vases which all depict Gigantomachies and which may well have been inspired by the Gigantomachy on the inner surface of the Parthenos shield. The fragmentary Naples kalyx krater 2045 (Fig. 6.77), the Louvre neck-amphora S 1677, the Athens pelike 1333 and the Würzburg volute krater not only share certain figure poses and groups; they also have in common the same compositional feature of adversaries coming at each other from above and from below, the former in the case of the gods, the latter in the 395 So Pliny, NH 35.54. 396 Strabo, 8.3.30, and Pausanias, V.10.2. 397 Pausanias, V.11.6, and Pliny, NH 35.54 and 57; 36.177.

The fact that it occurs in these Gigantomachies as well as on the shield Amazonomachy perhaps suggests that it is a genuinely Pheidian idea. The activity and turbulence of the scene depicted on the shield exterior is in keeping with the character of many of the scenes shown in the sculptural adornments of both the Parthenos and the Parthenon. This is quite unlike the taste for stillness apparent in early Classical works, which tend to focus on the moment before or after a major event. Battle- scenes were the subject not only of the shield exterior and interior, but also of the four groups of temple metopes as well as of the Parthenos sandal edges. In different ways, both pediments show a moment of crisis at the centre of the composition, which creates a wave of reaction and movement in the figures on either side, gradually subsiding as it reaches the outer edges of the group. In the frieze a peaceful subject is dealt with, but there is an ebb and flow of movement which lends rhythm to the composition and expresses the different nature of different parts of the procession. From the existing copies of the shield figures, it is possible to recognize a style which is in harmony with the general style of the Parthenon sculptures. These matters are considered in more detail in the chapter on the Parthenon, where drapery styles, figure types and the use of landscape elements are discussed. As on the Parthenon frieze, the figures are leaner than those of the Polykleitan canon and the heads tend to share the same rather expressionless and idealizing form. Feelings and attitudes are expressed in the pose rather than in the face, as is clear from, for instance, the taut muscles of the Greek ducking behind his shield in the group of three (Fig. 6.50). The danger he is in and his consequent state of alertness and fear are clearly shown in the Piraeus copy of this figure.401 Heads are shown in a number of different positions. Fully frontal heads include that of 'Kapaneus' (Fig. 6.56) and the striking upside down face of the dead Amazon who has fallen backwards (Fig. 6.59). Most of the heads are shown in profile or three-quarter profile, but an intriguing figure is the backview Amazon in the group of three (Fig. 6.52).402 Perhaps her head was shown in profile, but it is also possible that it was shown in 'profil perdu', a scheme which is known to have interested painters in the time of Pheidias and which also occurred on some of the vase paintings of Gigantomachies which may be related to the inner side of the Parthenos shield.403 Drapery is sometimes used to underline the violent or rapid movement of a figure. This is particularly noticeable in the chlamys of the Munich Greek type and the stone-thrower, as well as in the chiton of the Amazon from the hair- pulling group. Such use of drapery can be compared, for example, to the lines of the cloak as it falls behind the Lapith in south metope, 7, and the chitons of the foot soldiers of the frieze, N.XXIII.64 and N.XXVII.71.404 Age is indicated in the male figures by the presence or absence of a beard, as well as by the slighter build of the more youthful fighters. The pilos-wearer and 'Kapaneus' are among the older fighters, while examples of younger men are the Greeks in the axe group 400 For these vases, see Boardman (1989) figs. 327; 329; 326; 330. 401 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 20. 402 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 21. 403 This matter is discussed by Robertson (1992) 258. 404 Numbering follows Jenkins (1994).</page><page sequence="129">1 1 0 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS and the hair-pulling group, as well as the dead Greek at the bottom of the shield. Harrison has suggested that the Greeks probably represent the ten Eponymous Heroes plus some Tribal Heroes, a number of whom were not yet fully grown at the time of the Amazon attack on Athens.405 Apart from the depiction of age, there is little to differentiate individuals. Some variation in dress can be observed, notably in the pilos of one Greek and the panther skin of one Amazon but, despite popular tales, these probably do not say much about the identity of the wearer. An interesting innovation on the shield is the fact that the Amazons are not depicted in exotic Persian dress for once, with Phrygian caps and Scythian trousers. Some of the Amazons wear linen chitons like the Greeks and Attic-style helmets. Others, like some of the horsemen of the Parthenon frieze, are shown in Thracian dress, with heavier woollen chitons and fur-lined boots. The link with Thrace is perhaps intended to recall that Ares, the mythical ancestor of the Amazons, had special connections with this area. It may also call to mind the conflict against Eleusis and the Thracians, in the time of Erechtheus, when foreigners fought in Athens for the first time. This subject may have been alluded to on the west pediment of the Parthenon, though Connelly is surely going too far in her suggestion that it was the main subject of these sculptures.406 (B) THE SHIELD PORTRAITS Anecdotes concerning the shield seem to have developed from Hellenistic times onwards. One is that Pheidias included his self-portrait on the shield in such a way that if his portrait was ever removed the whole statue would fall apart. Another is that the shield bore portraits of both himself and Perikles in the shield Amazonomachy. Plutarch even identifies the figures in question: Pheidias is the bald old man hurling a stone, and Perikles is the warrior holding a spear in front of his face. Both these anecdotes are quite fanciful and, as Preisshofen has shown, a careful examination of the relevant sources reveals how these tales may have evolved.407 Neither Pliny nor Pausanias mentions these anecdotes. The earliest references concerning these matters come from Cicero, writing in the 1st century BC. In one passage, Cicero comments that since Pheidias was not allowed to sign the Athena Parthenos - for reasons which are not given - he included a likeness of himself, sui similem speciem , on the goddess's shield.408 Cicero does not say it was a portrait as such, only a likeness. This information presumably came from an earlier source, no longer 405 Harrison (1981) 305-07. 406 Connelly (1993) 309ff. She also interprets the east frieze as the preparations for the sacrifice of the youngest daughter of Erechtheus, carried out in order to save Athens from the attack of Eumolpos of Eleusis. Wesenberg (1995) 149-78 proves that this interpretation is incorrect. He points out that figures V31 and V32 are not the sisters of the victim, carrying their shrouds on their heads, as Connelly maintains, but Arrephoroi bearing cult objects wrapped in cloth and carried on trays. Their identity is proved by the fact that V32 is also holding a lamp on its stand. The lamp was used by the Arrephoroi to make their ceremonial nocturnal journey from the Akropolis to the sanctuary of Aphrodite. 407 Preisshofen (1974) 50-69. 408 Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 1.15.34.</page><page sequence="130">ATHENA PARTHENOS 111 known. In another completely unrelated passage, concerned with what he calls 'loose' styles of oratory, soluta , Cicero comments that their effect on a speech is similar to the effect that would result from taking apart Pheidias's famous shield: the beauty of the composition would be destroyed, though not that of the individual parts.409 The details of the Parthenos composition, such as the shield decorations, clearly struck Cicero forcibly for he mentions them a third time, but in this passage there is no mention of a portrait or the possible dismantling of the shield.410 Talking about an artist's signature, Valerius Maximus, writing in the 1st century AD, states that Pheidias effectively signed his Athena Parthenos by including a portrait of himself, effigiem suam , on the shield.411 He adds that if the portrait was ever removed the whole shield would fall apart. The context in which Valerius introduces the mention of Pheidias, as well as Valerius's turn of phrase, suggests that he had read Cicero. But it is not clear where Valerius acquired the idea that the likeness of Pheidias, which he calls a portrait, acted as a mechanism which could destroy the shield if it was tampered with. It seems possible that Valerius fabricated this idea out of Cicero's comments in Tusc. Disp. 1.15.34, which he either misremembered or misunderstood. The story was further developed and, by the earlier 2nd century AD, two new elements can be found: that the portrait was placed in the middle of the shield and that its removal would spell the destruction not just of the shield but of the whole statue.412 Preisshofen has convincingly shown that these modifications to the story were made specifically in order to enhance the author's comparison of God's place in the kosmos and Pheidias's self- portrait on the shield.413 It is most unlikely that either of these ideas has any basis in fact and archaeological evidence does at least prove that the central part of the Parthenos shield was occupied not by a human head but by a gorgoneion. Writers of the later 2nd century AD, such as Apuleius, repeat the story in a similar fashion.414 The latest surviving modifications to the tale were made by Ampelius, writing in the later 2nd or earlier 3rd century AD. He states that the central shield portrait that controlled the whole statue showed Daidalos and that the shield was connected to the rest of the work by a single finger of the goddess's left hand resting on the shield. This last remark is proved false at least in part by the archaeological evidence, which clearly shows that the goddess rested four fingers on the shield rim. As Preisshofen shows, Ampelius was not interested in the Athena Parthenos as a work of art and he does not attempt to describe the statue.415 Like Ps. Aristotle, De mir. ause. 155, he was interested only in the mechanism which supposedly held the whole work together and which, in Ampelius's judgement, earned the Athena Parthenos a place amongst the wonders of the world. The mention of the finger is Ampelius's explanation of how the mechanism could be connected 409 Cicero, Or. 71.234. 410 Cicero, De Orat. 11.17. 411 Valerius Maximus, Fact.

Ause. 155. 415 Preisshofen (1974) 62-63.</page><page sequence="131">1 1 2 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS to the whole statue. Preisshofen also dismisses the mention of Daidalos in connection with the shield mechanism as an attempt by the author to embellish the story, for Daidalos was the most famous and cunning of all inventors.416 No other source mentions Daidalos in this context. In all the sources interested in the supposed destruction mechanism, only one shield portrait is ever mentioned. This is not surprising considering that the portrait is always directly associated with the mechanism and it is often given central place on the shield. According to another tradition, which does not mention the destruction mechanism, there were two portraits on the shield, one of Pheidias and one of Perikles. This is mentioned by two authors writing in the late 1st century AD: Plutarch and Dio Chrysostomos.417 According to Preisshofen, the story of the two shield portraits stems from anecdotes about the trial of Pheidias. Although Dio Chrysostomos does not talk directly of the trial of Pheidias, his use of the phrase TíepocXéa 8è Kai aÚTÒv XaGùv seems to mirror Plutarch's words olov éTTiKpÚTTTeiv rr'v oļiOLOTīļTa, in Per. 31, a passage which does deal directly with the trial of Pheidias. According to Plutarch, Pheidias was accused of stealing the gold used to make the statue, but this charge would not hold since the gold had been affixed in such a way that it could be removed and weighed when necessary. Nevertheless, people were jealous of Pheidias, especially because he had included portraits of himself and Perikles on the goddess's shield, so they had him arrested - on a charge Plutarch does not specify - and put in prison. Although the trial is reported by many authors, little is in fact known about it. In particular, it is not clear which charge was successfully brought against Pheidias. Since the shield portraits are not mentioned in accounts of the trial dating from the 5th and 4th centuries BC, Preisshofen concludes that they must come from some later, apocryphal version of the story with no basis in fact. (C) THE GORGONEION There are no secure references to the shield gorgoneion in the collected sources. Several sources, the earliest dating from the 4th century BC, refer to the notorious theft of a gorgoneion from the Athenian Akropolis. Köhler and Dinsmoor were of the opinion that the gorgoneion in question, which they believed was gold-plated, belonged to the shield of the Athena Parthenos.418 Synesios, drawing on Andokides, refers to the gorgoneion that was stolen as Tfjç Geou tò Topyoveiov àKpoTTÓXewç, and Dinsmoor thought that this object could be equated with the one described as oittò Tfjç àamôoç Tf1ç cittò tô veto, which is mentioned several times, between 398/397 and 368/367 BC, in the Parthenon Treasures Inventory lists.419 He believed that the latter was the shield gorgoneion of the Athena Parthenos. According to Dinsmoor, it was stolen "during the disturbances of the Peloponnesian War ... but it was recovered at least as early as 398 BC", when it was 416 Preisshofen (1974) 62. 417 Plutarch, Per. 31, and Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII.6. 418 Köhler (1880) 96-97; Dinsmoor (1934) 96. 419 Synesios, Calv. Ene . XIX.83A. For the gorgoneion mentioned in Parthenon treasures inventory lists, see IG II2, 1388; 1393; 1400; 1401; 1407; 1412; 1415; 1421; 1424a; 1425.</page><page sequence="132">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 1 3 housed in the Hekatompedon "awaiting restoration".420 The shield is mentioned as intact in at least two 4th century BC inventories of the Parthenon treasures.421 Donnay argues against this theory for several reasons 422 He points out that the words, Trjs àuò tô veto, used in the inventory lists quoted above would not be the normal designation for the shield of the Parthenos; this would rather be r) aamç roi) áyaX|iaToç. Secondly, he argues that the shield gorgoneion of the Parthenos was probably not made of gold, but rather of ivory, like that of the aegis.423 Furthermore, there is no direct mention of the Athena Parthenos in any of the sources for the famous theft of a gorgoneion. On the other hand, when Eustathios talks of the theft of a gorgoneion he specifies that it came from the statue of Athena Polias and Kleidemos, quoted by Plutarch, says that the theft of a gorgoneion from Athens occurred in 480 BC, at the time of the evacuation of Athens before the Battle of Salamis.424 The event to which Kleidemos is referring happened well before the time of the Parthenos, of course, but it could relate to the Athena Polias and it is possible that both authors are referring to one and the same event. It seems likely, considering the venerable nature of the xoanon in question, that the theft of its gorgoneion would have become a cause célebre. There is no evidence that the gorgoneion was ever recovered. Isokrates uses the name Philourgos, the thief of a gorgoneion, as a by word for a famous swindler. It is possible that he too is referring to the same notorious deed. The Suda confuses the picture slightly by stating in one place that Philourgos stole a gorgoneion and in another place that Phileas stole a gorgoneion from a statue of Athena on the Akropolis.425 It is not clear whether two different thefts from two different statues are being alluded to or whether the second name is simply a mistake on the part of the lexicographer. The latter possibility is not unlikely. Several marble works of Athena Parthenos type include a rendering of the shield gorgoneion. These are the Varvakeion (Fig. 6.75), Lenormant, Patras (Fig. 6.36) and Belgrade statuettes, the Strangford shield (Fig. 6.33), the shield of the Conservatori torso (Fig. 6.35), and the shield fragment from Cyrene (Fig. 6.74).426 The fact that the renderings of the gorgoneion and its encircling garland of snakes are so different in the various works inspired by the Parthenos suggests that these details were not or, perhaps for technical reasons, could not be copied mechanically. It is possible they were made of metal, as Weber suspects, perhaps in the same manner as the Greeks and Amazons on the shield exterior.427 These are thought by some to have been gilded bronze appliqués.428 420 Dinsmoor (1934) 96, note 6. 421 See /GII2 1443, lines 10-11, dating from 344 BC, and /GII2 1468, lines 6-8, dating from 321 BC. 422 Donnay (1968b) 27-28. 423 For which see Pausanias, 1.24.7. 424 Eustathios, Ad Od.

Unfortunately, neither the sources nor later versions based on the type settle the matter. Leipen estimates that the gorgoneion was about 0.80m in diameter on a shield approximately 4m in diameter.429 Weber's estimate of 5.4m for the shield diameter, which is based on the size of a real shield relative to its user, is considerably larger and perhaps suggests that the gorgoneion too was larger than Leipen thought.430 The head type of the gorgoneion varies somewhat in later versions, appearing very heavy and squat on the Cyrene fragment and the Strangford shield, for instance, and much less so on the Patras shield. But the basic type seems fairly clear: the Gorgon is shown with heavy locks of hair parted down the middle of her head, her features are fleshy, and the tongue protrudes from her open mouth. Like the Gorgon of the aegis, she lacks the fangs and the exaggeratedly wide mouth of Archaic Gorgons. Where later versions differ most strongly is in the depiction of the snake ring encircling the gorgoneion, not only in the number of snakes, but also in their positions and distance from the gorgoneion. Some versions omit the snakes completely, for example, the Lenormant statuette, which is admittedly unfinished and very small in scale. The Strangford shield has only two snakes, their heads and tails entwined above and below the Gorgon's head respectively, and the snakes are set very close to the Gorgon's head. Several versions, however, show many more snakes - as many as seven on the Patras statuette and eight on the Cyrene fragment - and sometimes, as, for instance, on the Conservatori fragment and the Patras statuette, the snakes are set at some distance from the central head. Another difference can be observed in the arrangement of the snakes, which ranges from the highly stylized pattern of the Cyrene fragment to the simple twists of the Patras statuette. Floren used the Cyrene arrangement of the snakes in his reconstruction, while Harrison favours the simpler and more spacious arrangement of the Patras statuette.431 Strocka's reconstruction is similar to Harrison's, except that he includes eight rather than six snakes and he makes their twists and turns rather more complex by having some snakes coiling their heads round.432 Harrison observes that the arrrangement of the shield, with its central gorgoneion in high relief and fighters in combat disposed all around, is probably inspired from the tradition of votive bronze shields made in Crete from the late 9th to the early 7th century BC by craftsmen originating in north Syria.433 These shields generally had a lion's head at the centre and, while some examples were adorned with a heraldic device, others had a circular frieze. Following Ridgway, Harrison points out that, along with the animal protomai of Athena's helmet, these deliberately orientalizing and archaizing features of the composition probably served to "suggest the antiquity of Athena's cult".434 One should also bear in mind the description of the shield made by Hephaistos for Achilles in Iliad , XVIII.478-608. Here too the surface seems to have been adorned with circular friezes, 429 Leipen (1971) 46. 430 Weber (1993) 119-20. 431 Floren (1978) 42, fig. 1; Harrison (1981) 291, fig. 3. 432 Strocka (1982) 192, fig. 4. 433 Harrison (1996) 46^7. 434 Ridgway (1992) 132-33.</page><page sequence="134">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 1 5 though in this case there were five friezes in all and each one was of astonishing intricacy. It is possible that Homer's description too was inspired by Cretan shields. (D) THE GIGANTOMACHY Pliny alone preserves the valuable information that the inner surface of the Parthenos shield was adorned with a Gigantomachy.435 Along with other decorative features, such as the Amazonomachy on the outside of the shield and the Centauromachy on the sandal edges, Pliny includes the Gigantomachy on the inside of the shield as further proof of Pheidias' s ability to use every available space for artistic creation. There is only one surviving copy of the shield which includes the remains of a Gigantomachy on its inner surface. This is the Strangford shield, a marble sculpture of the Roman period. The figures of two giants are still faintly visible. They are executed in paint (Fig. 6.76). This has been taken as evidence that the inner surface of the original shield also was decorated in paint. Taken on its own, this evidence is not compelling, for it should be noted that on the small-scale marble copies many of the decorative details, including the eyes of the goddess, for instance, her sandal straps, and the aegis markings, were rendered in paint. This was presumably done partly because of the scale of the work, as well as the material. Furthermore, in his description of the shield, Pliny states that Pheidias caelavit both the Amazonomachy and the Gigantomachy. This implies metal figures. On the other hand, in another passage, NH 35.54, Pliny says that Pheidias started out as a painter and that he painted a shield in Athens. Although there is no firm evidence to connect this information with the shield of the Athena Parthenos, it is possible that the Parthenos shield is indeed the one Pliny was talking about. It is well known that artists did sometimes paint the inside of shields. One example is the shield of the Athena at Elis by Kolotes, the inside of which was painted by Panainos.436 The two remaining figures on the Strangford shield Gigantomachy are a pair of giants. They can be identified by the fact that each one is holding a rock. The figure on the left has a beard and he leans forward slightly, straining his muscles in an effort to carry a great boulder, which he has lifted to waist level. He is seen in three-quarter view to the right. Near him kneels a second giant, and he is hurling a rock with his right hand. Both figures appear to be wearing animal skins. Unfortunately, very little else can be made out. Studies of Gigantomachies in Attic vase painting have been made by von Salis and Vian.437 As Arafat demonstrates, however, no strong parallels can be found for either of the two Strangford giants in any of these scenes - even in the one on the favoured Naples kalyx krater, no. 2045 (Fig. 6.77).438 Without the help of the Strangford giants to create even a tenuous link with any particular vase scene, it would be rash to reach a definite conclusion about which scenes may echo the Parthenos shield and in what particular respects. Nevertheless, the fragmentary Naples kalyx krater just mentioned, which dates from the late 5th century BC, does have two features which are unusual enough to suggest 435 Pliny, NH 36.18. 436 Pliny, NH , 35.54. 437 von Salis (1940); Vian (1952). 438 Arafat (1986) 4.

Addenda 183.</page><page sequence="135">1 1 6 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS that this vase may convey something of the composition of the Pheidian Gigantomachy. The first is the depiction of the vault of heaven, with the giants shown below this division and the gods set above it. Arafat points out that this feature "gives the composition the form of a shield".439 The arched line might reflect the bracing on the inside of the shield in the original composition. The second is the appearance of Selene on her mule and Helios with his quadriga at either end of the composition. Arafat attributes their presence here to no more than their particular role in the story. According to Apollodoros, "Zeus forbade Eos, Selene, and Helios to shine while he gathered the magic herb which would have rendered the giants invincible".440 Selene and Helios are not merely present in the scene, they are placed at either end of the scene as a framing motif. It is thus that they are found again on the base of the Parthenos, on the east pediment, and in the first and twenty- ninth metopes of the north side of the temple. If Fehr is correct about the significance of this motif, its connection with the calendar reforms of the mid-fifth century BC, and the fact that the motif disappeared completely within a few decades of its creation, then it seems likely that the motif does betray a Pheidian source of inspiration for the scene on the vase.441 This framing motif is discussed in connection with the base in section 4. Another vase which deserves attention is the Baksy krater in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, dating from the late 5th or early 4th century BC. There can be no doubt that Shefton is correct in seeing both several allusions to the Parthenon sculptures on this vase as well as deliberate references to the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos.442 Although Pheidias's statue of Athena is not exactly copied in the Athena standing to the right of Zeus on the top register of this vase, the triple-crested helmet, the aegis and the shield by Athena's side, with paintings on the inner surface, are all obvious identifying characteristics. What one can see of the inner shield decorations is particularly interesting (Fig. 6.78). Apart from a wave pattern around the outside, there is the figure of a naked male warrior, wearing a helmet and carrying a shield. His right leg, which disappears behind the figure of Athena, is bent at the knee, with the foot evidently set at a higher level than the left foot. The figure's head is bent as he looks down, presumably at his adversary below. This pose would accord well with a multi-level composition such as was used for the Amazonomachy on the outside of the Parthenos shield and such as is occasionally found in Gigantomachy scenes on Greek vases dating from after the Athena Parthenos and which, therefore, may have been influenced by this work. See, for example, the Gigantomachy by the Pronomos painter, which even has a fighter in the same pose as the one shown on the shield of the Baksy krater (Fig. 6.79).443 A Parthenos-related Athena with a decorated shield also figures on the Karlsruhe hydria, B 36 (2 5 9). 444 Athena wears a triple-crested helmet, the outer crests mounted on horse protomai, and her raised cheek-pieces are adorned with an animal motif, possibly Centaurs. 439 Arafat (1986) 5. 440 So Arafat (1986) 5.

Where it is not obstructed by the goddess's body and left forearm, the inner surface of the shield is partially visible. Small, shadowy forms around the shield arm band give a tantalizing glimpse of a fighting scene, involving anthropomorphic figures in poses of violent movement. Some are striding vigorously, some are moving their arms about dramatically, one figure seems to have collapsed. A Gigantomachy scene seems very probable. One can only wish that the scale was large enough to allow a more detailed analysis. A relief work which may be compared with the shield of the Athena Parthenos is the east frieze of the Hephaisteion.445 The subject of this work is not clearly understood, but at the centre of the composition rages a battle in which some of the figures fight with large boulders. Two of these figures are seen from back view. That the artists of the shield compositions and the Hephaisteion friezes were drawing on similar ideas is suggested by other similarities between the works. The use of a rocky groundline under the figures and the occasional use of large outcrops of rock to support more complex figure poses can be seen on both works. Some of the figure poses are reminiscent of shield figures too: in addition to the slumped corpses, for instance, the movement of the right arm and leg of the fourth figure from the left on slab 1 may be compared with the Greek in the 'Antiope' group on the shield Amazonomachy (see Figs. 6.80-81). The flying chiton of the second figure from the left on slab 1 is not dissimilar to that of the Amazon in the hair-pulling group (Figs. 6.46 and 48). The date of the Hephaisteion east frieze is a matter of controversy but similarities between this work and both the Parthenon metopes and the Parthenos Amazonomachy suggests that a date in the 430s BC is about right. It was probably made late enough to show the influence of these works, but not so late as to be influenced by the Parthenon frieze, which differs radically from the Hephaisteion friezes in many important respects. 6.4. THE BASE The base of the Parthenos was situated some distance beyond the middle of the Parthenon naos, facing the east door. The foundations of the Parthenon on the south side slope down more than 11m below the upper surface of the temple. Stevens estimated that there was probably as much as 7m of solid poros construction beneath the centre of the base of the Parthenos.446 The base is the only part of the statue of which some original fragments remain and, until not long ago, they were still in their original place. The traces of the statue base included an area of about 2.65m by 6.53m covered not in marble pavement slabs, like the rest of the naos, but in thirty blocks of cheaper poros limestone 447 Placed exactly in the middle of this area is a rectangular socket, measuring roughly 0.542m by 0.755m and 0.372m deep, which held the vertical timber that ran through the base and into the statue as the chief supporting element of the statue. Around this area can be seen the 445 Dörig (1985) discusses this work in detail. 446 Stevens (1957) 350ff. 447 For the measurements, see Dinsmoor (1934) 93.</page><page sequence="137">1 1 8 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS engraved outline of the original base, which was very large, measuring approximately 8m by 4m.448 The base would have occupied most of the width of the space between the inner colonnades of the naos, this space measuring 9.82m. The central marble blocks of the base all measured about 1.03m by 1.30m by 0.295m high; there were eight slabs in two rows of four. Eleven more slabs were set around these, seven of which were of double length. Six of the central eight blocks survive. They are made of Pentelic marble and they carry anathyrosis on all four sides. None of the front blocks of the base survive, so whether they too were made of Pentelic marble or whether they were made of darker Eleusinian limestone, as in the case of the base of the Zeus at Olympia, remains unknown.449 Dinsmoor has shown that there is evidence, in the presence of five Roman style dowel holes, for the replacement of the outside bottom blocks of the base in Roman times; the face of the reconstructed base was set 0.188m further in than the original.450 Abundant traces of fire in the naos suggest that much more than merely the facing of the base was damaged in ancient times, and there has been much speculation about whether or not the statue itself was destroyed by fire and had to be replaced. Unfortunately, the Roman dowel holes alone do not provide a clear date for substantial repairs to the statue base, and perhaps to the statue itself, and it is possible that the Parthenon was ravaged by fire on more than one occasion. From circumstantial evidence, Dinsmoor placed the reparation of the base and the reconstruction of the statue in around 160 BC.451 Ridgway has suggested that the dowel holes and, therefore the repair of the base, could be as late as the 4th or 5th century AD, but she does not rule out the possibility that the statue was replaced earlier, perhaps in the Antonine period.452 The problems about the survival of the Parthenos are discussed in section 6, concerning the history of the Athena Parthenos. Very little information can be gleaned from the ancient sources concerning the base. Pausanias and Pliny both mention it, and there is also some information about it in the inscriptions from the Parthenon Treasures Inventory lists.453 Pausanias states that the subject which was depicted in relief on the base, was the birth of Pandora, whom Hesiod and other writers say was the first woman. Pliny says that, along with Pandora, there were twenty gods depicted. He also says that the statue measured 26 cubits high. Leipen thinks that this measurement is the height not just of the statue but of the entire composition, including the base.454 Following Stevens's reconstruction, which relies on the relative proportions of the base and the figure of the Varvakeion and Lenormant statuettes, Leipen estimates that the base was about 1.5m high, which is roughly equivalent to 3 cubits.455 448 Korres (1994) 146 says 7.85m by 3.90m; Leipen (1971) 23 says 8.065m by 4.10m; Dinsmoor (1934) 93, says 8.043m by 4.096m. 449 Palagia (2000) 54 and n. 8. 450 Dinsmoor (1934) 95. 451 Dinsmoor (1934) 105f. 452 Ridgway (1981) 162-63. 453 Pausanias, 1.24.7 and Pliny, NH 36.19. 454 Leipen (1971) 23. 455 Stevens (1955) 240ff.</page><page sequence="138">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 1 9 Stevens and Leipen reckon that the figured frieze of the base, excluding the upper and lower mouldings, measured some 0.75m high.456 More recently, however, Weber has shown that in the high Classical period 2 cubits was the normal height for a statue base irrespective of the statue's height.457 Although of different sizes, the Athena of Priene and the Nemesis at Rhamnous both had bases of this height; the Classical bases in the Hephaisteion, in the temple of Athena in Delos and in the tholos at Delphi were likewise of this height; according to Dörpfeld, the base of the Zeus at Olympia was only one-third of a cubit higher 458 The need for a low base seems to have been dictated partly by practical considerations, for offerings were sometimes placed on the bases of temple statues; there is evidence to show that this was the case in the Parthenon, as well as in the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous, for instance.459 Weber agrees that Pliny's measurement of 26 cubits includes the base for, as she points out, Pliny describes the base, along with various other parts of the composition, after he has given the statue's size.460 She therefore proposes that Athena alone was 24 cubits high, the base 2 cubits high, and the base figures 1 cubit high. As Weber shows, such a height for the statue would tie in very well with the other known dimensions of the composition, for it would make Athena about six times larger than the figure of Nike on her hand and about twelve times larger than the relief figures on the shield.461 In addition to the poros limestone foundations and the six marble blocks from the core of the base, there also survives a moulded crown of dark Eleusinian limestone, which came originally from the upper course of the base. This was found reused in a post-Herulian tower in the Athenian Agora.462 It seems probable that other mouldings were attached to this course, perhaps in gilded wood. Concerning the mouldings of the statue base, some evidence may be gathered from the base of the Varvakeion statuette and the fragments from the Priene cult statue. Weber considers the Priene cult statue a faithful replica of the Parthenos in all details apart from size and material: the Priene image was acrolithic and about half the size of the Parthenos.463 Like the lower part of the base of the Varvakeion statuette, the Priene base had a cyma reversa decorated with Lesbian leaf supported by a bead-and-reel in relief raised on a flat fillet. The plain cyma reversa at the top of the base of the Varvakeion statuette corresponds with a massive egg-and-dart in dark stone at the top of the Priene base. Two of the blocks from this black ornamental course were identified in 456 Stevens (1955) 240ff.; Leipen (1971) 23-24. 457 Weber (1993) 94-95. 458 Dörpfeld (1892) 14f. 459 For the Parthenon, see Donnay (1968b) 25, n. 7; for the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous, see Weber (1993) 96-97. 460 Weber (1993) 108. 461 Concerning the height of Nike, see Pausanias, 1.24.7.

Blocks of breccia ashlar with earth fill behind them formed the core of the Priene base, which was covered in marble slabs. At Priene, however, the base was open at the back. The technique of the Parthenos base relief is not known for certain. Stevens was of the opinion that it was a marble relief carved on the marble blocks of the base.467 If so, it is possible that the figures were gilded to make them stand out against the background and to echo the gold of the statue above. The inclusion of the base, however, along with the statue and the shield, among the treasures of the Parthenon, suggests that it too carried ornamentation in precious materials.468 Pliny's use of the words caelatum est and caelavit in connection with the technique of both the base and the shield of Athena, which was made of metal, seems to support the view that the figures of the base were worked in metal too 469 It is possible that metal figures - golden or gilded bronze - were dowelled on to the base of the Parthenos, as Leipen suggests.470 The base of the Zeus at Olympia had 'golden' figures in relief, according to Pausanias, and it is possible that Pheidias tried to achieve similar effects in both cases. He may even have used similar techniques.471 Since many replicas of Athena Parthenos type were made on a very small scale, it is not surprising to find that most omit details of the various relief decorations which adorned the composition. But two works based on this type, the Lenormant statuette and the Pergamon statue, show some details of the figured frieze represented on the base and these help one form some idea of the iconography of the depiction (Figs. 6.82-83). The base of the Lenormant statuette is adorned with a small number of figures, no more than six. The central figures of the Lenormant base are depicted as simply standing in a line, a feature that is repeated on the base of the 3m tall Pergamon statue. On either side of the central figures can clearly be seen the figures of Helios rising on the far left with his chariot and, on the far right, a figure with a horse, who is most probably Selene, a framing motif which has become strongly associated with Pheidias, and which may not be relevant to the story depicted on the base. 464 Koenigs (1983) 160, pl. 36.6, inv. 1140. 465 Carter (1990) 135, and pl. 3b. 466 Carter (1990) 225 and 313-14. 467 Stevens (1955) 260. 468 See Parthenon Treasures Inscriptions in Volume 2. 469 Pliny, 36.18-19.

Three females wearing peploi can be seen on the left hand side of the composition. The outer figures both stand in similar attitudes, with strong folds covering the supporting left leg, but the disposition of their peploi in the upper body and their arm movements are different. The outer woman, who wears a peplos with kolpos and overfold, has her left hand raised holding her long veil, in the attitude of a bride, and her right hand lowered by her side clutching the edge of the veil lower down, as it billows out at her side. The inner woman holds something in her hands. This has usually been interpreted as the overfold of her peplos, but Robertson challenges this idea and suggests that the object is in fact a belt.472 The central female in this group wears a belted peplos with a long overfold and a back mantle fastened at the shoulders. Her left arm hangs down, while the right is raised to her breast. The heads and most of the legs of all three figures are missing, but it is clear that they were gently turning in to look at the central figure, representing another female who stands completely motionless in a fully frontal pose, her arms hanging down at her sides, the left hand holding a cornucopia.473 On the other side of this woman are the badly damaged remains of two more figures facing to the front, their right arms apparently lowered. The outer figure is wrapped in a himation. Weber estimates that the maximum dimensions of the surviving base block of the Pergamon statue were 69cm deep and 1 16cm long and that the block originally carried ten out of the twenty-one figures numbered by Pliny: Pandora in the middle, with four gods on her right and five on her left 474 She also observes that Pandora is deliberately placed about 9-1 Ocm to the left of the centre of the block, probably so that her figure coincides with the axis of the statue above, which is slightly to one side because of the uneven weight distribution: the left leg is relaxed and set slightly to the side. Weber points out that the original base of the Pergamon Athena must have been both longer and deeper than what remains since this would not have been large enough to hold the complete statue with its arms and feet. According to Weber, there would have been one more block on either side of the existing block, the left one carrying a further six relief figures and the right one carrying a further five. Thus the original base would have shown Pandora with ten gods on either side. Weber estimates 13cm per figure on the outer blocks, which would bring the total length of the base to 2.59m. The myth of the creation of Pandora, the first woman, is rarely found in Greek literature, but it is related twice by Hesiod. In Theogony , 570-610, Hesiod relates that Zeus ordered the creation of the first woman as a punishment for the theft of fire by Prometheus. The woman was fashioned out of earth by Hephaistos and adorned by Athena. It is from her that all women are descended and it is because of women that the world is full of misery. In Works and Days, 57-105, Hesiod again describes the creation of the first woman, but this time one reads not only of the involvement of Zeus, Hephaistos and Athena in the story, but also of many other gods who all gave gifts to the woman: Aphrodite gave her charm, while Hermes gave her impudence and a lying heart, the Charités and Peitho put golden necklaces around her neck, while the Horai presented her with garlands of Spring flowers. According to Hesiod, Hermes named the woman Pandora, 'All Gifts', because all the gods on Olympus gave her a gift. This explanation of the 472 Robertson (2004) 93. 473 Fehr (1981) 70. 474 Weber (1993) 104.</page><page sequence="141">122 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS meaning of the name is probably wrong. It is more likely that the name means 'she who gives all gifts'. The Hesiodic tradition of the woman fashioned in clay by Hephaistos and then presented with gifts by many gods seems to find visual expression in early Classical vase painting. The British Museum white-ground cup (D4) by the Tarquinia painter, which dates from about 460 BC, shows a standing, frontal figure being adorned with crown and peplos by a very youthful Athena and Hephaistos (Fig. 6.84). The figure is not labelled "Pandora" but "Anesidora", though this may not be of great matter as both names probably mean much the same, that is 'she who sends up gifts'. There is also a red-figure krater (British Museum E 467) by the Niobid painter, from around 460 BC, which shows a woman standing in a fully frontal pose, with her arms at her sides, being given a crown by Athena, with Iris, Zeus and Poseidon standing to the left and Ares, Hermes and perhaps Aphrodite standing to the right. As Hurwit has shown there was a second, non-Hesiodic tradition of the birth of Pandora which is also depicted in early Classical vase painting.475 In this quite different version, Pandora is a chthonic goddess, and she is seen emerging from the ground after Epimetheus has hammered upon it. It is not clear how the two traditions fit together, if at all, but it seems certain that the iconography of the latter version - with Pandora shown rising out of the ground, her legs still beneath ground level, and her face shown in profile - is not the one used by Pheidias for his Parthenos statue base. The combined evidence of the first group of vases described above and the Pergamon and Lenormant reliefs indicates that the iconography of the original reliefs on the Parthenos base included a stiff, frontal figure at the centre of the composition portraying Pandora, and a number of gods standing on either side of her, some visibly bearing gifts. Exactly which gods were represented and in what manner is not known but Hesiod surely provides some valuable clues. From the evidence of the Lenormant statuette one can probably say with some confidence that Helios and Selene opened and closed the scene respectively. One would expect to find Athena and Hephaistos present, as well as Zeus, who ordered Pandora's creation, and indeed some scholars have identified the first two in the figures standing on Pandora's left on the Pergamon base, though these are so badly damaged that it is difficult to be confident about their identities.476 It is usually assumed that the three women in peploi on Pandora's right on the Pergamon base depict the three Charités, also mentioned by Hesiod. Harrison has questioned this on the grounds that, of the three figures, the middle one would appear to be the youngest and in the visual arts the Graces, and indeed the Horai, normally appear in order of age if they are differentiated in this manner.477 Harrison therefore suggests that the triad of the literary tradition has been replaced here by the single goddess Charis, appearing between two other female deities, whom she identifies in a tentative manner as Aphrodite, in the leading position, and Demeter. If this is correct, then here is another point of similarity with the base of the Zeus at Olympia, on which Charis is known to have appeared unaccompanied by the other two Graces. In Harrison's words, "economy in the number of figures is coupled with a tendency to allegorize". 475 Hurwit (1995) 177. 476 See, for instance, Oppermann (1994) 165 and Robertson (2004) 90. 477 Harrison (1986) 196 and 200.</page><page sequence="142">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 23 Using the evidence of a damaged relief in Rhodes which copies the three women just mentioned and also preserves traces of a cithara on the far left side, Schuchhardt restores Apollo holding his kithara.478 This adds a festive note to the scene and suggests Pandora's forthcoming wedding. By Apollo's side, Schuchhardt adds Artemis and Leto, which he believes were copied on a relief now in the Villa Albani (Fig. 6.85).479 Fehr argues in favour of the appropriateness of the presence of the three Delian gods in the sculptural context of the Parthenos composition.480 Brommer disagrees with Schuchhardt's identification of the figures on the Villa Albani relief.481 He sees a similarity between the Artemis figure and figure 'G' on the Parthenon's east pediment, which he therefore identifies as Artemis. He thinks that the Apollo figure was a copy of the east pediment Apollo and that the 'Leto' was in fact a copy of 'Hestia' in the Aphrodite group of the same pediment. Bol compares the Artemis on the Albani relief with a votive relief from Brauron, dating from about 420 BC, and the Leto with the peplophoros on the far left of the Pergamon base.482 Weber looks into the matter of which other gods, apart from those listed by Hesiod, are likely to have appeared in Pheidias's composition and she suggests Poseidon, Hera, Ares, Demeter and Dionysos, but she reaches no strong conclusion about which of these should be included.483 Hurwit suggests that the figures of Zeus, Hephaistos and Athena on the Madrid Puteal, which have often been thought to derive from the Parthenon east pediment, may in fact be drawn from the figures on the base.484 Against this idea is Despinis who judges the prototypes of the figures to date from the 4th century BC.485 Ridgway is also of the opinion that some of the material put forward by scholars as evidence for the base of the Parthenos is simply too late.486 The significance of the repeated appearance of Helios and Selene both in the Parthenon sculptures and at Olympia is difficult to assess. These celestial gods were of oriental origin and they played a fairly insignificant role in Greek mythology. Unsatisified by the idea that their presence can be explained solely in terms of an artistic invention by Pheidias, Fehr suggested that they might have been included as part of a contemporary campaign to reform the calendar, bringing the lunar system of time reckoning into correlation with the 478 Schuchhardt (1975) 120ff., and pl. 26a. 479 Bol (1992) 102ff., 104, no. 287, pl. 71. 480 Fehr (1981) 71f. 481 Brommer (1984) 286. 482 Bol (1992) 102ff.

The public display of these gods alongside the Olympian gods is seen by Fehr as a deliberate attempt to establish their orthodoxy and to convince people to accept the calendar reforms. The subject of the base relief has been interpreted in a number of different ways by scholars. Generally, the Hesiodic picture of Pandora as the woman who brought so much evil into the world has dominated and the scene has been viewed as a reminder to worshippers of the vengefulness of the gods, their unreliability towards man and their hostility.488 For Pandora's creation was ordained by Zeus in order to punish mankind for the trespass of Prometheus. One may compare the depiction of the story of Actaeon on the temple at Selinus, and that of the Niobids on the throne of the Zeus at Olympia, as Robertson points out.489 In addition, Pandora is seen as highlighting some of the roles of the goddess Athena. Pandora brought work to mankind, while Athena, worshipped as Athena Ergane, was the goddess of work. Pandora was created out of clay and water, while Athena was the goddess of all crafts, including that particularly Athenian craft of pottery. The scene of dressing and gift-giving makes one think of a wedding, though there was no wedding here, and Athena was the goddess of good housekeeping in marriage. In his article on the subject of the implications of the myth of Pandora in relation to Athena and Athens, Hurwit concentrates on two further dimensions.490 These are patriarchy and autochthony. As a celebration of the superiority of the male over the female, the Parthenon is an important monument, according to Hurwit. The scene of the birth of Athena, fully grown from the head of Zeus, on the Parthenon's east pediment, completely denies the importance of motherhood. The genesis of Pandora, a figure who has no mother, reinforces this view, as does the presence of Erichthonios at Athena's side in the main composition. Erichthonios was another autochthonous figure who, according to the legend, was created from the sperm of Hephaistos as it was brushed to the ground after accidentally touching the virgin goddess Athena. In a society in which patriarchy was so important it is most apt that the patron goddess should be Athena. She was born of a man; she never experienced the weakness of childhood or the need for a mother; she 'mothered' another being, Erichthonios, without losing her virginity or suffering the labour of childbirth and motherhood; she bore the weapons and helmet of a soldier; she stood for the virtues of wisdom, self-control and rationality which were not normally associated with the female 487 Fehr (1980) 113ff. Fehr is wrong to state that the use of Helios and Selene as a framing motif ceased after the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. They are found on the Tribune of Echmoun of c. 340 BC. See Stucky (1984) 18-19, pls. 4, 2; 6, 1; 16, 1 and 2, nos. 2 and 17. 488 Connelly (1996) 72-76 rejects the view that the base illustrates the birth of the Pandora. She is of the opinion that the birth in question is that of one of the daughters of Erechtheus, who may have been called Pandora too, although this is not certain. As such, the base would, in Connelly's view, reinforce the message of the temple frieze, which she interprets as the story of the sacrifice of the youngest daughter of Erechtheus and Praxithea to save Athens from Eumolpos and his Thracian army in what was the first military attack on the city. 489 Robertson (1975) 312. 490 Hurwit (1995) 18 Iff.</page><page sequence="144">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 25 sex; she always sides with the male.491 In such a context, the story of Pandora provides the ideal justification for patriarchy. Male dominance is quite appropriate if one accepts that suffering, pain and evil, as well as hard work, were all brought into the world by woman. On a political level it justified the exclusion of women from any significant role in society. As Hurwit says, "there, below, was the purely feminine and dangerous woman, and there, above, was the armed goddess who discounts her own gender and sexuality, who nobly aspires to the masculine, and who thus stands as an ideal icon for Athens."492 The presence of Pandora acknowledges the necessity of women in the community, but her position under the feet of Athena graphically illustrates the need to control and dominate creatures perceived as irrational, deceitful and promiscuous. A further message which Hurwit draws from the use by Pheidias of the Pandora myth in this composition is that the presence of Pandora "represents the existence of evil and the possibility of catastrophe even in a patriotic, ever-victorious, and patriarchic paradise."493 He sees the myth as a warning to Periklean Athens that even with the protection of Athena, goddess of resourcefulness, wisdom and cunning, the city may be in danger from forces beyond control. And indeed, just a few years after the Parthenon was completed, the city was devastated by plague, "one of the evils that beautiful, unthinking Pandora had let loose upon the world."494 Palagia challenges the assumption that the dark and negative vision of Pandora as beautiful evil, such as it is recorded in the works of Hesiod mentioned above, is at the root of Pheidias's composition.495 Palagia brings to light a different tradition, also attributed to Hesiod in ancient times, according to which Pandora was remembered as the mother of all Greek people.496 Born of the clay fashioned by Hephaistos into which life was breathed by Athena, Pandora was adorned by Athena and the three Graces. Pandora gave birth to a son, Deukalion, whose father was Prometheus. She also gave birth to a daughter, Pyrrha, fathered by Epimetheus. The child of Deukalion and Pyrrha was Hellen, the legendary ancestor of the Hellenic race. Palagia points to the more positive image given to Pandora in this role and she suggests that it was this tradition which was the basis for Pheidias's relief. She also suggests that the relief carries a clear political message which, in the manner of Perikles's funeral oration (Thucydides 11.41 . 1), is strongly patriotic and pro Athenian. For Athens is portrayed as giving gifts to the entire Greek people. The theme of the birth of Pandora, which is not a common theme in Greek art, is another strand that helps to weave together the different parts of the sculptural adornments of the Parthenon into one complex whole. Just as the birth of Pandora was figured on the base, so the birth of Athena could be seen on the temple's east pediment. In each case, they were born fully grown in the presence of the gods, who endowed them with gifts. The theme of gift giving echoed the scene on the east frieze of the Parthenon. The image of the gods giving gifts reminded the viewer of the goodness of the gods and their kindness to mortals. 491 See, for instance, Aeschylus, Eum. 736-38. 492 Hurwit (1995) 185. 493 Hurwit (1995) 186. 494 Loc. cit. 495 Palagia (2000) 60-62. See also Arafat (1990) 62. 496 Hesiod, Catalogue of Women, fr. 2 MW.</page><page sequence="145">126 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS In an interpretation which explores the Boeotian origins of Hesiod's Pandora myth, Robertson suggests that the scene on the statue base is simply a cult myth which aims to explain the origins of a particular ritual, in this case one associated with the peplos ceremony of the Panathenaic Festival, the subject of the temple frieze. The new peplos, which was presented to Athena at this festival, was folded up at the end of the ceremony and kept in the peplotheke until it was required at the Kallynteria festival to robe the old statue of Athena Polias. Thus the presentation of the peplos at the Panathenaic festival implies the ceremonial cleansing and dressing of the goddess which will follow in due course. Robertson points to the fact that the girding of Pandora with a belt, by the goddess Athena, features in Hesiod's account of the story of Pandora. And on the Pergamon base, the third figure from the left holds a belt. Thus there is reason to believe that the ritual girding of Athena was seen to have its origins in the myth of the girding of Pandora. The two different traditions concerning Pandora, which are found illustrated in vase painting, suggest to Robertson that the Central Greek version of the myth related by Hesiod was adopted by the Athenians no earlier than the generation before the building of the Parthenon, only to disappear very soon afterwards in favour of a new, Athenian version of the story. This phenomenon is explained in terms of "the rise and fall of Athens' domination of Boeotia between 458 or 457 and 447 or 446."497 6.5. THE STATUE OF NIKE Information about the Nike held in the right hand of the Athena Parthenos in the ancient sources is scanty. Pausanias, 1.24.7, relates that the figure of Nike was about four cubits tall and that it stood on the hand of the goddess, on the other side from her spear. Arrian tries to help one visualize the moment encapsulated by Pheidias in his sculpture: Nike has just alighted on the outstretched hand of Athena and there she now stands. Pliny, NH 36.18, singles out the Nike for special mention, saying that the Nike was praecipue mirabili but he gives no descriptive details. From the literary sources one can only add that the Nike was provided with wings and that, as Demosthenes, C. Timocr. 121, says someone stole those wings within a hundred years of their creation. Pliny states that the Parthenos statue measured 26 cubits in height, while Pausanias says that the Nike measured some 4 cubits, ôaov Teaaápwv ur)xwv.498 If the 26 cubits mentioned by Pliny included 2 cubits for the statue base, as argued in section 4 concerning the base, then the heights of the Nike and the Athena Parthenos stood in a ratio of one to six. A very similar ratio is displayed by the Varvakeion copy of the Athena Parthenos composition: the Nike, restored with head one sixth the height of the body, would measure 0.161m, while the Athena measures 0.94m. In section 2 it was suggested that a non- standard foot of 0.307m was used for the construction of both the Parthenon and the Parthenos. If this is correct, then the figure of Nike would have measured 1.842m, while Athena measured 11.052m. The Hekatompedon inventories of the Parthenon treasures, which were kept until the end of the 4th century BC, provide a little more information about the Nike.

It weighed 60 drachmai, that is, about 300gr, and was a new acquisition made in the year 428/427 BC.499 In 405/404 BC this entry disappears from the Hekatompedon accounts, but there is a new entry which specifies the golden crown on the head of the Nike of the Athena Parthenos.500 It is unweighed. This entry is then found repeated, with insignificant variations, in numerous accounts down to the end of the 4th century BC.501 It seems more than likely that these two different forms of entries refer to one and the same object, given that the second entry is found only when the first ceases to be used and that the use of the second form of entry, which is more specific about the Nike in question, coincides almost exactly with the addition to the treasures of the Hekatompedon of other statues of Nike, with which it could from then on have been confused. Donnay was of the opinion that the wreath from the head of the Nike was added to the composition after a military triumph just before 428 BC.502 He concluded that the Pheidian Nike must originally have been bare-headed. As mentioned above, the weight of the wreath is given in the inventories down to 408/407 BC, whereas from 405/404 BC the wreath is said to be âaTa0|ioç. This is perhaps related to the fact that from 402/401 BC, there appear in the Parthenon inventories four golden olive leaves which are said to be 'from the wreath which the Nike has, the Nike in the hand of the statue, weight 6dr 2ob.'503 It is possible that the wreath was damaged some time between 408/407 and 405/404 BC, either by accident or possibly as a result of the troubled times around 404 BC, and that four leaves of the wreath became detached; the leaves were then transferred from the Hekatompedon to the Parthenon for safe-keeping and the treasurers subsequently decided either that it was no longer necessary to give the weight of the wreath in this incomplete state or that it would be dangerous to try to weigh the wreath and risk further damage to an already delicate object. Of the many works which follow the scheme of the Athena Parthenos relatively few preserve the figure of Nike. In many cases this is simply due to the fragmentary nature of the remains but in other cases it is because the composition has been modified for various reasons. Take, for instance, the Marburg statuette: the attitude and some of the attributes of Athena Parthenos are recognizable, but the right hand holds a patera.504 One of the most 499 See IG I3 323.51-52, and similar entries in IG I3 324-31; 333-34; 336; 339; 340. 500 See IG I3 342.2-4. 501 IG II-III2, 1384; 1386; 1388-90; 1393; 1400; 1407; 1413; 1415; 1424a; 1425; 1468; 1476; 1477; Agora, I 4527. 502 Donnay (1968b) 22-25. 503 See IG II2, 1376, lines 19-21; 1377, 22-24; 1394, 5-8; 1395, 22-24 and 1414, 10-11; Harris (1995) 133, no. 95. 504 Leipen (1971) no. 48, fig. 47.

Schuchhardt dated the work in the 3rd century AD and Nick hints at some time around AD 220-230.505 It was found in a house of the Roman period in the northern part of Athens, where it had been deliberately hidden away and protected by a brick vault. The Nike is portrayed standing on the hand of Athena, wearing a heavy sleeveless peplos, of the closed kind, with a long girdled overfold. Bound twice around her waist and draped over her left forearm is a himation. Nike has large wings on her back and these are lowered but not folded. Her left arm is bent at the elbow while her right is slightly lowered and in her hands she holds the ends of ribbons, originally from a fillet (this object can be seen on the silver stater of Aphrodisias, for instance). Her knees are slightly bent and she is standing on her toes with her body leaning slightly forwards as if she has just descended from the sky. The left foot is visible, set in a forward position and not covered by drapery. Motion is indicated in the lower folds of the peplos which are swept by the wind against her legs, revealing their form. She stands positioned three-quarters to the right; in this way she is seen almost frontally by the spectator while at the same time she does not turn her back on the goddess Athena. The head of the Varvakeion Nike is missing but it may originally have turned slightly to her left, in the direction of Athena. Unlike Leipen's reconstruction of the Parthenos Nike, the Varvakeion Nike wears a closed peplos of which the overfall hangs in a straight line that slopes down to the figure's left side in stiff folds almost like pleats.506 The heaviness of the folds and the way in which they flare out from the body suggest that the overfall is of the sort that was decorated with a border, such as would have thickened the fabric and made it stiffer than the rest of the dress. Harrison believes that the Varvakeion Nike is faithful to the Parthenos Nike in these details, which would be quite appropriate both as regards the date of the Parthenos Nike and as regards Nike's role as an attendant figure, for whom such a dress was very common: it can be seen worn by the Nike on the bobbin by the Penthesilea helmet, but it is now very damaged and indistinct. It does not seem to have had high crests. Unlike the Parthenos, this figure has no snake, Nike or spear. In her right hand she holds a patera. Furthermore, the belt is set very high, and although the peplos overfold is quite long it does not reach as far down the legs as one would expect for the Parthenos type. Hamiaux (2001) 219, no. 228.

Found in Cyprus, Kourion. The pose, with spear and shield to the left, the aegis, Attic helmet, and rearing snake are all reminiscent of the Parthenos type. And yet there is no gorgoneion on the aegis, the helmet has only one crest, the spear apparently stands unsupported behind the shield, and the left hand is placed untypically low on the outer side of the shield. Most unusual is the fact that the right hand carries an aphlaston, that is, the stern of a ship, suggesting that the gem was cut in memory of some naval victory. The work is of high quality and it is thought to be by an artist of the circle of Dexamenos of Chios.

Leipen thinks it "essentially corresponds with the Varvakeion Nike, disregarding some differences in the costume."508 For the Pennsylvania Nike wears an aegis with gorgoneion and no himation. Leipen also points out that the arms, now missing, were completely free and detached from the body. Leipen's assessment is misleading, for the two figures are in fact quite different. The windswept peplos on the legs may perhaps bear comparison but, in addition to the differences already pointed out, one can add that the leg positions are different in the two figures, as are the peplos overfalls, the folds of drapery on the upper body, and the arm positions (the left arm of the Pennsylvania Nike was raised). There seems to be no evidence to support the addition of an aegis,509 but the possibly derived type of the Berlin Nikai may provide evidence for the himation rolled around the waist. As to the arms, it is possible that they are shown attached to the body in stone versions simply because of the constraints of the medium being used, while in the chryselephantine original they were separated, and even perhaps held away from the body. Leipen follows the arm positions of the Varvakeion Nike in her reconstruction. Evidence from coins, however, suggests that the left arm may have been set somewhat higher, perhaps as on the Pennsylvania Nike. See, for instance, a Roman coin from Athens in the British Museum.510 Such a graceful movement of the arms would have suited the action of the Nike, holding as she did the ends of the long fillet; it would have made the whole figure appear less stiff than the Varvakeion Nike. On the other hand, it is difficult to see how to reconcile the himation fold over the left forearm and a higher left arm position, unless the left arm is raised only slightly higher than Leipen has it. Finds from the temple of Athena Polias at Priene include a couple of gilded bronze wings (Fig. 6.87).511 The wings are right and left ones and, judging from their provenance, size and shape, it is extremely probable that they once belonged to the Nike on the hand of the cult statue which, according to Weber, was a half-size, acrolithic work that followed the Athena Parthenos type very faithfully. This evidence would confirm that Nike had lowered wings, the upper parts of which followed the curve of the shoulders, and that the gold once covering them was richly patterned to depict the feathers. How faithful a copy the Priene statue was is not known, but coins of Priene seem to confirm that Nike's wings were lowered.512 Representations of Nike with raised wings cannot be regarded as copies of the Parthenos Nike. Thus, one can rule out the Nike on an acanthus column of 507 The bobbin by the Penthesilea Painter, New York 28.167; the Boston pelike, Boston 20.187; the Munich stamnos, Munich 2412.

Yet the Agora head clearly turned in the other direction, for the right eye is further from the nose than the left eye. The Agora head measures 0.29m in height. This is too large for a copy of a head from a figure which measured about four cubits, that is just about life-size or slightly bigger. Weber also thinks that the Agora head is too far removed in style from that of the Parthenos to reflect the head of the Parthenos Nike. The fact that the Agora head does not wear a wreath but is bound with a broad ribbon may not be such a strong argument against the identification for, as discussed earlier, it is probable that the wreath which adorned the Parthenos Nike from 428/427 BC was not an integral part of Pheidias's composition. The Berlin Nike type has been thought by many scholars to bear some resemblance to the Varvakeion Nike and, therefore, to be related perhaps to the work of Pheidias.516 The body type is known in at least eleven Roman versions, but there is no proof that the surviving heads belong to the same type. The similarities between the Berlin Nike type and the Varvakeion Nike include the position of the left arm, the thick roll of himation around the waist and over the left forearm, and the windswept drapery over the lower legs, which reveal the form of the legs. But, on closer inspection, it seems that neither the pose nor the drapery of the Berlin and Varvakeion Nikai have much in common after all. Important differences between the two types include the following: the Berlin Nike wears a chiton, with sleeves; crossing bands, attached at the centre with a Gorgon's head brooch, hold the chiton in place over the torso; the himation hangs down to the knees; the right arm is in the same position as the left and the right hand holds a wreath; the legs are set firmly together and the feet point downwards. On the basis of the supposedly strong typological similarities between the Berlin Nike type and the Varvakeion Nike, two theories have been put forward relating the Berlin Nike to the work of Pheidias. Schräder interpreted the Berlin type as the Nike on the hand of the Zeus at Olympia.517 This view has been challenged strongly by Gulaki.518 For a discussion of the matter, see Zeus at Olympia, section 3, concerning the Nike. A different theory is that put forward by Thompson, who suggested that the type was created under the influence of the Parthenos Nike and was used for the golden Nikai dedicated on the Akropolis some time around 434 513 For the prize amphorae Nike on an acanthus column, see Kunze-Götte (1984) 192-94.

For, unlike other features, these alone appear regularly on examples of the Berlin type, and they are seen as suitable to a female accustomed to swift motion. Without further evidence to support it, Leipen's decision to adopt the crossed bands seems arbitrary. The Berlin Nike is at most a variation on the Parthenos Nike and even this much is not certain. It is probable that, like the Parthenos herself, the Parthenos Nike was a chryselephantine statue. Made primarily of wood, the figure would have been finished with a covering of gold for the drapery and perhaps for the hair, and ivory for the skin. The open wreath or fillet in her hands was probably made of gold. The large wings would have been of gold or gilded bronze. From Philochoros one learns that the entire Parthenos composition used forty- four talents of state treasury gold.521 It has been estimated by von Gerkan that gold plates about 0.57mm thick would have covered the drapery and possibly the hair of the Parthenos and the Nike, but he is of the opinion that the accessories would only have been gilded.522 Leipen, following Stevens, suggests that the Nike was connected to the arm of Athena by means of a wrought iron bar passing through the centre of the statue.523 Stevens estimated that the total weight of the Nike statue, with iron bar, wood, gold plates, and gilded wings, probably came to about 110kg. Although the statue of Nike was much smaller than that of Athena, it was not an insignificant piece, measuring as it did some six feet in height. As has been pointed out by other writers, the size of the Nike is important as it provided the viewer with a reminder of the relative size of a mere mortal in comparison with Athena: the goddess Nike was shown as slightly larger than a man, just as she might have seemed if she appeared before humans. In connection with the Nike, one has to consider the unresolved question of whether or not the original composition included a support for the Nike under the hand of Athena. The statue base measured approximately 8m wide by 4m deep, and the figure of Athena is known to have occupied the centre of this area.524 Leipen estimated that Athena and her drapery covered one third of the width of the base, that is about 2.66m, while the right side of the base was principally occupied by the shield.525 Thus, the left side of this wide base would have provided ample space (Leipen estimated about 2.70m) for some sculptural feature. Indeed the lack of any feature on this side would perhaps have created an imbalance in the composition quite out of keeping with Classical tastes. There is no evidence at all in the written sources for a support beneath Nike and the evidence from extant versions of the 519 Thompson (1944) 173ff. 520 Leipen (1971) 35. 521 Philochoros, scholia Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06. 522 von Gerkan (1955-56) 55-58. 523 Leipen (1971) 35-36; Stevens (1955) 267. 524 See section 4, concerning the base. 525 Leipen (1984) 178.</page><page sequence="151">1 32 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS type is difficult to interpret. The weight and the size of the Nike, added to the weight of Athena's bent forearm, which Stevens estimated to have been about 210kg, have suggested to a number of scholars that a support was necessary.526 Supports for an extended forearm are not unknown amongst ancient colossal chryselephantine statues. The Zeus at Olympia by Pheidias was shown seated on his throne and the whole of his right forearm, of which the hand carried Nike, was conveniently placed on the arm-rest of the throne. The 4th century BC Asklepios at Epidauros by Thrasymedes of Paros showed the seated god extending his right hand over the head of a serpent, which appeared to be rising up beside him. In touching the head of the serpent the arm was unobtrusively supported.527 Yet, as Nick says, other statues bearing a figured attribute are recorded and none of these had supports, as far as one can tell.528 It is significant that no written source alludes to a support under the figure of Nike, as one would expect if the support was a meaningful part of the composition. Nevertheless, this fact on its own cannot be accepted as conclusive evidence that such a support did not exist. Few sources reveal anything very informative about the Athena Parthenos composition and, of the most important sources, neither Pausanias nor Pliny claim to go into the subject in great detail. Pliny specifies that he is just making a few 'passing remarks' about Pheidias's talent, intended to illustrate the artist's ability to create beauty even in the smallest details of a great work of art.529 Consequently, he selects some of the finer features of the Parthenos composition for special mention, without attempting to describe the whole work. Pausanias 's description is so sketchy that it provides only the broadest outlines of the work: he omits any mention of the work's rich relief decoration, for instance; he does not even give the name of the sculptor.530 But then Book 1 of Pausanias 's description of Greece was written and published before the rest of the work, when Pausanias had not yet come to grips with the huge task he had undertaken. This is clear from a comment he makes in the middle of his description of the Akropolis, when he says he must get on for he wants to describe the whole of Greece: Ael 8é [ie acjHKecröai TOÖ Xóyov TTpÓCFü), TTCtVTCl 0|IOLû)Ç €TT€£lÓVTa Ta' EMīļVlKCL531 Of the works in marble in the round, the Varvakeion statuette alone shows the hand of Athena resting on a tall column, with Nike standing on the palm of Athena's hand. As Leipen observed, the Varvakeion column is of a most unusual form.532 A large plain torus is surmounted by a smaller torus, a concave trochilus and a double roundel. The column shaft is fairly slender in its proportions and it displays slight entasis. The capital of the column is unusual too: beneath a large, square abacus are two plain calathi, the lower one with a small torus beneath it and a torus-like upper end, and the upper one ending with a 526 Stevens (1955) 267.

Given the angle at which the forearm is held, the material of the Varvakeion statuette makes the column essential. The strength of this evidence, therefore, cannot be considered very great. Leipen suspected that the brace on the right hip of the Athena from Gortyn might originally have supported a column on this side.533 But Karanastassis thinks that the brace was needed to hold the lower right arm in place, for the arm of this figure was in a very wide angle.534 She suspects that the same was true of the Argos statuette, and perhaps the Patras statuette.535 Nick thinks the Antalya statue and the Akropolis torso 1362 might also have had struts.536 In the case of the Lenormant statuette, the right forearm is held so low that even a strut would have been unnecessary to keep it steady. Nick points out that there is no sign of remains of a support on any of the surviving plinths of the marble copies let alone space to put one, save in the case of the Belgrade statuette.537 This could be taken to mean either that a support was not part of the original composition or that it was omitted more often than not by copyists. Leipen sought to strengthen the evidence provided by the Varvakeion statuette with some small terracotta statuettes which include a columnar support.538 Deonna long suspected the authenticity of the Geneva statuette.539 His doubts were confirmed in 1983 533 Leipen (1971) no. 15, fig. 10. 534 Karanastassis (1987) 331. 535 Karanastassis (1987) 332. 536 Nick (2002) 169 and n. 1110. 537 Nick (2002) 169.

Turning to two-dimensional works, one has to consider images on coins, tokens, gems and reliefs. Nick rightly suggests that coins of Asia Minor should be discounted as they are probably not directly related to the Athena Parthenos, but reflect local works inspired by the Athena Parthenos.541 The coins of Aphrodisias and Priene fall into this category.542 The Aphrodisias stater of 375 BC, the earliest Greek coin to show the whole figure of the Parthenos, and the Priene coins from the age of Severus Alexander (AD 222-235) and Valerianus (AD 254-260) all show a tree trunk with lopped branches - possibly an olive - supporting the Nike. Priene coins of the age of Hadrian (AD 1 17-138) and Septimius Severus (AD 1 93-2 1 1 ) show a snake on the right side of the goddess, sometimes rearing up beneath the right hand, almost like a support, sometimes nearer the goddess and staying lower down. 4th century BC staters from Side are of no relevance either, for these include a pomegranate, the city's punning identifier, in the space beneath the goddess's right arm.543 The evidence from Athenian coins and tokens is difficult to 540 Prag and Bowman (1983) 151-54. 541 Nick (2002) 167. 542 London, British Museum, Hill no. 15, coin of Aphrodisias: Diam. 22-24mm; Wght. 9.88gr.

Features reflecting the Athena Parthenos type are the triple-crested helmet, the aegis, the long peplos, girdled at the waist, and the overfold. The figure stands with her weight on her right leg. The left arm is held down, with the hand on the shield, while the right hand is held out and bears a Nike, holding a taenia. Differences from the type include the lack of a serpent and spear, and the position of the left arm which is held well away from the body. Under the right hand is an olive trunk, a feature repeated on a number of coins from the east. It is probable that this coin reflects a local statue based on the Parthenos.

London, British Museum, coin of Valerianus: Bronze. From Priene. AD 253-260. The coin is well preserved. On one side it has an image resembling the Athena Parthenos type. The pose, dress and attributes are all fairly standard, but the serpent is situated on the goddess's right side and the spear stands behind the shield, unsupported by Athena. Under the right arm is a tree-trunk support. The two front parts of the aegis are circular in shape. Coin nos. Hill 57 and 58 also show similar figures with a tree-trunk support under the right arm. The figure is probably not directly related to the Athena Parthenos but perhaps reflects a version of the Athena Polias of Priene. Similar coins from Priene show the serpent on the goddess's right side and no tree-trunk support under the right arm. See Nick (2002) 168 and n. 1102, pl. 17, 6 and 7.

In many examples showing the Athena Parthenos, the figure of Nike is depicted very close to the outer edge of the coin, in such a way that the space beneath Nike is fully occupied with the inscription set around the coin.544 Sometimes no support is indicated beneath the Nike and sometimes there is an owl, a tree, a bucranium, an altar, a snake and, in one case, a column.545 Like the coins and tokens, Roman gems are very varied. Richter regarded examples such as the gem in New York as strong evidence against the inclusion of a support in the original composition. 546 But these pieces are of late date. Their depiction is, necessarily, selective (the snake, for instance, is not always shown). Furthermore, the details are not always faithful: Athena is sometimes shown wearing a Corinthian helmet.547 Depictions on reliefs in stone can be quite varied too, with details altered to wreath. The serpent is missing and beneath the goddess's right arm is a large pomegranate, the symbol of Side. Unlike the Parthenos, this figure wears a plain Attic helmet with a single, long, flowing crest.

Richter (1971) 34, no. 98. 548 See, for example, the following reliefs in which the stance, dress and attributes of Athena vary and yet something of the Parthenos is reflected: (1) Athens, Akropolis Museum, Walter, no 19. Votive relief. H. 0.28m; W. 0.26m; D. 0.18m. Marble. From the Athenian Akropolis, c. 340-330 BC. The relief is very battered and weathered. Part of the frame is preserved at the top, and some of the right edge survives but otherwise the relief is broken all round. The fragment preserves a standing figure of Athena, to a little below the waist. Athena is turned very slightly to the left. In the manner of the Parthenos, the goddess wears a triple-crested helmet, and she has a front-opening aegis with a gorgoneion in the middle. The aegis is cut quite square and it covers the breasts. Athena also has the typical peplos, which is tied at the waist and which has folds of cloth hanging over the belt on each side and a long overfold. Her left arm hangs down by her side. But her right upper arm is moved slightly away from her body. The lower arm does not survive, but it may well have been stretched out towards another figure in the relief, whom the goddess was crowning or perhaps shaking by the hand. The belt at the waist is not formed with snakes. Walter (1923) 17-18, no. 19. (2) Athens, Akropolis Museum, 3003. Votive relief. H. 0.55m; W. 0.39m; D. 0.13m. Marble. From the Athenian Akropolis, c.330 BC. Part of the border is preserved on three sides of the relief. The right side of the relief is all that survives, apart from the bottom corner. Athena's face is quite damaged, and she has also lost her left foot, and her right hand. The altar to her right is mostly preserved, but the small human figure on the left i s almost completely lost apart from a little of his legs. Of the Nike once on the goddess's right hand, only a tiny part of one of her wings can be made out. Another fragment of this relief may survive in Walter, no. 39a (inv. 2413), which preserves a young girl, carrying a large basket on her head, and the head of a slightly taller boy. This fragmentary votive relief shows a standing figure of Athena on the right side. The relief was originally bordered by antae supporting an entablature with antefixes. Athena is shown three-quarters to the left. She stands with the weight on the right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side, the left arm hanging down, the hand placed on the rim of her upright shield, and the right upper arm down at her side, with the forearm extended. On her right hand she originally held a figure of Nike, as is clear from the remains of a small part of a wing. Athena wears a belted peplos with a long overfold, arranged in a manner similar to that of the Parthenos. She also wears a standard front-opening aegis, square cut and covering the breasts, and adorned with a central gorgoneion. The belt is set somewhat higher than is typical. The buttoned chiton beneath the peplos, which is visible on the left upper arm, deviates from the type. On her left side she props up a spear, in the manner of the Parthenos, but the upright shield has migrated to a position to her right. Part of its rim is apparent by the altar. The helmet is damaged, but it seems to have a central crest with no support. Other details of the type are missing, for example, the snakes at the belt, and the shoulder locks.

The relief fragment has a very damaged and battered surface. Part of the top right corner is preserved, but otherwise the work i s broken all round. The figure of Athena is quite sketchy and her face, right hand and much of the left arm are almost completely gone. The fragment comes from a votive relief with a standing figure of Athena on the right side. Athena is shown three-quarters to the left. She stands with the weight on the right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side. The left arm hangs down and the hand is placed on the rim of her upright shield, while the right arm is bent at the elbow and the forearm stretches forwards. The details of her attire are very unclear but numerous folds cover the right leg, while the left leg is visible through the drapery. Folds of cloth can also be seen hanging down over the upper right arm. She seems to have worn a high and complicated helmet, the outline of which can still be seen extending up on to the upper border of the relief. Beneath the right hand is a box-shaped altar.

These are the votive relief, Berlin Sk 881 (K 104, Fig. 6.88), and a lead token, also in Berlin.549 The value of these pieces in terms of evidence is unclear. The votive relief dates from around 330-320 BC while the date of the lead token is not known for certain. They both come from Athens. In the case of the votive relief, the column is unusual for two reasons. It is partially hidden from view behind the person who is being honoured in the relief, so there is no compositional reason for its depiction. And, instead of being shown in relief, as one would expect, it has been incised. Stevens suggested that the column might have been added at a later date.550 Nick prefers to leave the question open as to why these two works included a column, but she concludes that it is clear from the evidence of the marble copies that a support was only added when strictly necessary for technical reasons.551 Scholars remain divided concerning the question of the support and three main positions have been taken on the issue. Some think that a support was necessary from the outset and that the support formed an intrinsic part of the composition.552 Others think that no support was ever needed or included in the original composition.553 And finally there are those who think that the support was added some time after the composition was completed, when structural problems concerning Nike and the right arm became apparent.554 Lange was the first to suggest that the Varvakeion capital was a simplified version of the Corinthian capital and that in the original sculpture the leaves might have been added in metal.555 Leipen accepted this suggestion and put forward the view that the Corinthian capital was first invented as a solution for the particular problem of the Nike supporting column which needed to have slender proportions, to have a pleasing aspect when seen from any angle, and to fit in well with the Doric columns of the naos.556 The inventor of the Corinthian capital is reported by Vitruvius to have been the sculptor Callimachus.557 It may be rather simplistic to think that the Corinthian capital was invented at all, rather than that it developed over a period of time and from already existing motifs and forms. It also seems likely that the Corinthian capital was first used in an architectural rather than a sculptural context. Indeed, there may be reason to link the development of the Corinthian capital with the Parthenon rather than the Parthenos. Pedersen has argued that the west room of the temple, or Parthenon proper, was designed as a centre-space room, its ceiling 549 See n. 545, above, for references. 550 Stevens (1961) 5. 551 Nick (2002) 171. 552 So Leipen (1971) 36ff. and Fehr (1979) 80ff. 553 So Richter (1956a) 147ff. and (1956b) no. 269; Nick (2002) 167ff. 554 So Lapatin (2001) 87. 555 Lange (1880) 72. 556 Leipen (1971) 38 and (1984) 178-80. 557 Vitruvius, De Arch.

He tentatively suggests that it would not have been dissimilar to the Delphi tholos capital and the Elis capital published by Mallwitz.559 Given the parallels which Fehr drew between the Athena Parthenos and the Archaic statue of Apollo on Delos, Fehr sought a link with Delos in the Nike support.560 He suggested that the column capital could have been a variant of the archaic palm capital, as seen in Egyptian art and known in Greek art.561 Three metal palm tree columns, two bronze and one gold, are mentioned in the ancient sources: they were 5th century BC Athenian votive offerings, presented in Greek sanctuaries, and two of these are directly associated with Athena.562 As Fehr points out, the palm tree would have conveyed a message of thanks to the goddess Athena for her gift of victory against the Persians. At the same time it would have indicated very aptly that the victory was won by Athens along with her allies in the Delian League, for the palm tree was sacred to Apollo. Apollo and Artemis were born beneath a palm tree on Delos and there was a palm tree near the Delian altar of Apollo. The problem with these theories is that they attempt to give the proposed support a significance which would have enhanced the composition and which would have made the support as much a part of the composition as any of the goddess's attributes. But there are very few copies of the Athena Parthenos with a column and none at all with a palm capital. There is, therefore, very little evidence in support of these theories. One cannot assume that it was because statues of Nike were traditionally placed on columns and, therefore, that the combination of a Nike and a column was not surprising to ancient eyes, that the column was simply glossed over in most copies of the Athena Parthenos.563 The Nike of the Parthenos composition was not a votive offering paid for from the spoils of battle. Therefore, such symbolism would not have been appropriate in the context. Nick is of the opinion that the chryselephantine composition had no technical need of a support for the right arm, as the centre of gravity of the statue would have been well within the body of the statue and, given the physical properties of wood, the colossal arm held at a right angle would have been able to support the weight of Nike.564 As evidence of this posture, Nick points to the Epidauros statuette and the little terracotta statuettes from Delos. Although Nick does not agree with all the details of the Nashville/Tennessee reconstruction, she is of the opinion that it is instructive from a technical point of view. Many of the known copies of the Parthenos are made of marble and one must bear in mind 558 Pedersen (1989). 559 Pedersen (1989) figs. 21 and 24. 560 Fehr (1979) 82-83. 561 See Fehr (1979) pl. 2d. 562 See Pausanias, 1.26.6 and X.15.4; Plutarch, Nic. 3.6. 563 Leipen (1971) 37. 564 Nick (2002) 169.</page><page sequence="158">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 39 that some of their characteristics are directly linked with the technique involved, a very different technique from that of the original, chryselephantine statue. It was long ago suggested that the snake of the Parthenos composition was originally placed on the goddess's right side.565 Lapatin revives this theory and, in agreement with Stevens,566 supposes that the columnar support under the Nike was not an integral part of Pheidias's design. Lapatin proposes that in Pheidias's original scheme the Nike was supported by "some sort of cantilever system through the statue's central mast" and the serpent was set beneath her.567 According to Lapatin, such a scheme would have been preferable, for on the goddess's right side the serpent would have been clearly visible and it would not have obstructed the onlooker's view of the inner decorations of the shield. In addition, it would explain the depiction of the serpent on the goddess's right side in certain works showing the Parthenos type,568 and perhaps point to the source of inspiration for Thrasymedes' s composition at Epidauros, showing a coiled serpent raising its head up to the hand of Asklepios. But, since Athenian depictions of the Parthenos composition from as early as the mid 4th century BC sometimes show the snake within the concavity of the shield, Lapatin takes the view that the alterations made to the work for technical reasons, which he assumes to have involved moving the serpent to the goddess's left side and adding a column in order to provide adequate support beneath the Nike, were carried out within a hundred years of its creation. In conclusion one can say that the question of the support under the right arm of the Parthenos remains difficult to answer. It seems probable that Pheidias did not include a support, but whether one had to be added later remains possible. The material evidence is varied and not always easy to understand. Arrian thought that Nike was flying down to Athena's outstretched palm.569 A more plausible interpretation is that Athena is shown offering Nike as a gift to the Athenians. Sent by Athena, and embodying victory, Nike is about to fly off Athena's hand to deliver the taenia, which she holds in her hands, to mortals as a symbol of their victory.570 Victory was thought by the Greeks to be a gift of the gods, delivered through the intermediary figure of Nike. The composition thus symbolizes Athena's double role as avenger of wrongs and giver of kindnesses. For, while her right hand offers victory to her people, her left side presents her weapons, the shield impressively adorned with scenes of the slaughter of those well known enemies, the Amazons and the Giants. This arrangement echoes that of the Apollo of Delos, who held 565 See, for instance, Simart's reconstruction of 1855, Leipen (1971) fig. 59. 566 Stevens (1961) 1-7. Stevens argued that the column of the Varvakeion statuette reflects the appearance of the support under Nike not in the original composition but in the restored sculpture made in later times after fire had destroyed Pheidias's work and much of the naos. He suggested that the original statue showed Nike supported on an olive tree. He even found a niche for the owl of Athena in the hollow trunk of the tree. 567 Lapatin (2001) 87. 568 For example, the document relief, Athens, NM 2985, dating from the third quarter of the 4th century. 569 Arrian, Diss.

In both compositions the gods held anthropomorphic figures on their right hands, intermediaries who did not act independently but who gave to mortals the gifts of the gods. But, unlike Apollo who was shown holding a statue group of the three Graces, Athena was represented supporting a living Nike on her outstretched hand.572 6.6. THE HISTORY OF THE ATHENA PARTHENOS The Athena Parthenos was dedicated in the year 438 BC, probably at the Great Panathenaic festival held at the beginning of that year.573 From about this time and down to the end of the 4th century BC, a careful inspection was made each year to check that the statue was complete in all its parts, according to the Parthenos inventory, which was inscribed on a bronze stele and kept in the Parthenon west chamber, or Parthenon proper. Several inscriptions referring to the bronze stele and the Athena Parthenos have survived and these date from 385/384 BC down to 304/303 BC.574 The statue is described as complete - êvTeXèç-as late as 321/320 BC. But it is likely that by this date it had already suffered some damage and undergone restoration. Demosthenes, writing in 353/352 BC, reports that thieves had stolen the wings of the Nike. From the Hekatompedon accounts it also emerges that the Nike lost part of her gold crown around 405 BC; the crown was probably not designed by Pheidias, but added to the composition in honour of an Athenian victory about ten years after the statue was completed. Other early thefts probably included some of the valuable votive offerings placed on the statue base by worshippers.575 Apart from this damage, it appears that the Athena Parthenos remained unscathed as long as democracy survived in Athens. Thucydides, II. 13.5, had clearly stated that the gold, which he records as weighing 40 talents, had been affixed to the statue in such a way that it could be removed if necessary. The earliest stories reporting that the Athena Parthenos was relieved of its gold date from the beginning of the 3rd century BC and suggest that, after the tyrant Lachares took power 571 So Fehr (1979) 74f. 572 Fehr (1979) is perhaps right to see a parallel here between the Athena Parthenos and the Apollo of Delos, but Nick (2002) 171 suggests that it is perhaps an exaggeration to say that the Parthenos was directly related to the Delian statue, for other examples of statues with figured attributes in the right hand can be listed. 573 See Scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, and Hieronymus, Chron. 113. Arguments for a later date for the dedication of the statue were put forward by Triebel-Schubert (1983) but Wesenberg (1985) has argued convincingly against her. 574 /GII2 1407.6-7, 1410.7-8, 1443.10-11, 1468.6-8, 1477.12-14. 575 /GII2 1388.64-65, 1393.31, 1421.123-25, 1424a.319-21, 1425.245-47, 1443.208-10, 1455.10-11.</page><page sequence="160">ATHENA PARTHENOS 141 in Athens, he stripped the goddess, in about 297 BC, in order to pay his mercenaries.576 The old joke, quoted from the comic poet Demetrios by Athenaios, about the impious Lachares stripping Athena naked has suggested not only that most of the gold revetment was on the goddess's robes rather than on her attributes, which may only have been gold plated, but also that the statue of Athena was a fully finished sculpture in wood beneath its revetment, as was the case for Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia. The removal of the gold would have altered the statue considerably, but it would not have rendered the work unrecognizable or ruined its most outstanding features, notably the Nike, the helmet, the serpent and the relief adornments of the shield and base. When Pausanias saw the statue in the mid 2nd century AD, however, he reported that it was made of gold and ivory. If the statue had been stripped of its gold revetment, then it must have been replaced by the time Pausanias saw the statue. But when were the Athenians again rich enough to replace so much gold? Korres, who believes that the statue was stripped by Lachares, speculates that it was later restored with gilded plates of metal, perhaps bronze or copper, rather than gold.577 Linders, on the other hand, has put forward the view that the written sources should not be taken too literally on this matter, and should be interpreted rather as comic exaggerations.578 Lachares perhaps stripped the goddess in a metaphorical sense only, fleecing her of her treasure rather than of her dress. The importance of the Athena Parthenos throughout antiquity is reflected in the large number of works still in existence today which take their inspiration from this statue. Over fifty works in the round which imitate the Parthenos are known, and they date from the 4th century BC down to Roman Imperial times. These are discussed in section 8. Works inspired by the type seem to have been made in particularly large numbers in the 2nd century AD in Athens, in Hadrianic and Antonine times, and the type often figures on coins of this period. A statue of the emperor Hadrian was set up alongside the Parthenos during his reign.579 Hadrian was very generous in his treatment of the Athenians and during his reign it seems that all the religious festivals of Athens, including the Panathenaia, were celebrated with more splendour than ever before. In late antiquity, Athens was comparatively prosperous and relatively free, and the available evidence seems to suggest that Christianity was slow to take hold in Athens and put an end both to its long established pagan traditions and to its prestigious schools of philosophy. The first law against pagan sacrifice was passed by Constantine the Great in AD 321 and in AD 325 Christianity officially became the religion of the Empire. At the Council of Nicaea, held in AD 325, the whole of Greece was represented by only three bishops. But even after this time, when an increasing number of Athenians was being 576 Demetrios, comic poet, Fr. 1, apud Athenaios, Deipn.

In the temple of Zeus at Olympia, Pausanias saw statues of both Hadrian and Trajan, V.12.6. By associating himself with the great religious centres of Greece, Hadrian was trying to achieve "legitimacy" as well as "self-promotion", comments Arafat (1996) 162.</page><page sequence="161">142 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS converted to Christianity, there was an easy tolerance of pagans in Athens, partly as a result of the ready assumption of certain Neoplatonist views by the Christians. Between AD 361 and 363, the emperor Julian attempted to reinstate paganism and, from his writings, the impression received is that in Julian's life-time Athens was still rich in pagan monuments and the Akropolis was still closely linked with the worship of Athena.580 The pagan renaissance was but short-lived. After the time of Julian public sacrifices were again made illegal and pagan worship, though still widespread amongst certain sectors of society - in particular the philosophers and members of the old aristocratic families - became a dangerous activity unless it was carried out in a very discreet and private manner. This is clear from George of Alexandria's biography of John Chrysostom. From this source one gathers that some people still worshipped Athena in Athens in AD 367/368, and that students of philosophy still went to the Parthenon to pray before the image of the goddess.581 One also learns that such worship was officially forbidden and that even under the fairly tolerant co-emperors, Valens and Valentian I, it was only carried out in secret for fear of punishment.582 The discussion about paganism related by George of Alexandria purportedly takes place before the Athenian city council. One must, therefore, conclude that paganism was common amongst council members, as well as amongst the philosophers of Athens. The continuing presence of the Athena Parthenos in her temple about ten years later is confirmed by Zosimos who makes it clear that in the year AD 375 it was still possible to go into the Parthenon, to carry out rites and place an offering at the feet of the goddess.583 Nevertheless, the fact that the worship described by Zosimos was the act of a private individual and that this man had been refused permission by the archons to organize any public worship is further proof that paganism was having to go underground in the uncertain times after the death of Julian. In the late 4th and early 5th centuries AD, anti-pagan legislation was repeatedly enacted, proving that the laws were not uniformly applied and that people continued to flout them, at least in private. In AD 391 Theodosius I, who had previously allowed the destruction of temples by fanatical Christians, decreed that all temples should be closed and pagan cults banned. Under Arcadius (AD 395-408), in AD 399, it was decreed that idols might only be removed if there was proof that people still made sacrifices before them.584 The fact that pagan worship did continue after this time, however, is confirmed by the need for later imperial edicts against paganism. In AD 435 Theodosius II ordered the destruction of any temples still intact and in AD 438 the Theodosian code, proscribing pagan practices, was published. But Marcian's edict of AD 451 proves that some cult images still stood inside their temples at this date and that people still worshipped them in secret.585 Majorian's edict of AD 458 further confirms that some pagan temples were still standing then, for he 580 See, for instance, Ad Ath. 275 A and Misopogon , 348 C.

After the terrible destruction wrought on much of the city first by the Heruli in AD 267 and later by the Visigoths in AD 396, there was a great spurt of building activity, especially in the Agora, at the beginning of the 5th century AD and this included the construction of pagan edifices: a gymnasium complex was built, as well as a new stage for the theatre of Dionysos, for example. The prestigious Neoplatonic Academy, which was very rich and influential, was not closed down until AD 529, by order of Justinian. Asterios of Amasea lists a great number of popular cults still flourishing in Athens around AD 390- 400. 5 87 The survival of a great number of Hellenic cults in the next century is proved by Marinos in his biography of Proklos.588 Although ostensibly reduced to a civic festival, the Panathenaia continued to be celebrated with great splendour throughout the 4th and probably much of the 5th centuries AD.589 There is also evidence that the cult of Asklepios retained great importance in Athens until some time after the AD 480: Marinos reports that in AD 450^60 Proklos prayed in the shrine of Asklepios on the south slope of the Akropolis and Damascius reveals that the Asklepieion was still being used for incubation in the early years of AD 480.590 There is less certainty about the cult of Athena in the 5th century AD, but from Marinos's biography of Proklos it seems probable that the Athena Parthenos was still in her temple during most of Proklos's life (he died in AD 485). According to Trombley, the internal chronology of the biography points to the fact that the planned removal of the Parthenos from her temple, referred to in chapter 30, did not occur until very late in Proklos's life, shortly before he fell terminally ill.591 Trombley suggests a date around AD 484 for this event and for the ultimate closure of the Parthenon as a pagan temple. In support of this view, he demonstrates that political events taking place around this time would have provided a suitable context for the final suppression of paganism in Athens. In AD 481-488 Illus, the magister militum per Orientem , staged a rebellion against the Emperor Zeno, which found much support particularly amongst the aristocrats and the intellectuals of the east Roman cities. Trombley thinks it highly likely that there was Athenian support for Illus, who promised to restore Hellenic rites to temples still standing, and that this support may have occasioned such strong imperial displeasure that it was punished by the final, and relatively late, suppression of paganism in the city: the removal of the Athena Parthenos, the deconsecration of the temple and the demolition of the Asklepieion. Trombley further suggests that the two so-called quasi-Justinianic laws found in the Codex Iustinianus were probably issued by Zeno, shortly after AD 481, in an 586 Novels of Majorian, 4.1. 587 Asterios of Amasea, Homilia X in SS Martyres , PG 40, 324 A-D; see also Trombley (1993) 293. 588 Marinos, Vita Procli, passim^ in particular I, X, XI, XIX, XXIX. 589 See, for instance, Himerios, Or. 47.194f. and Damascius, Vita Is. fr. 273. 590 Marinos, Vita Procli , XXIX; Damascius, Vita Isidoři , fr. 218. 591 Trombley (1993) 82.</page><page sequence="163">144 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS attempt to crush paganism and quell Illus's rebellion. The first law is against the endowment of schools and temples, the second provides formulae for the Christianization of the Eastern Roman Empire. A terminus ante quern for the conversion of the Parthenon into a church is provided by the earliest surviving Christian graffito in the Parthenon which dates from AD 693. 592 Deichmann points to the presence of tombs on the south side of the temple, one of which contained coins from the reigns of Justin I, Justinian and Tiberius II.593 Scholars have tended to follow Frantz in the view that the conversion of the Parthenon to a Christian church of the Virgin Mary took place many years after the removal or destruction of the cult image and the subsequent deconsecration of the temple. According to Frantz, "immediate rededication would have been distasteful to Christians and offensive to pagans".594 The Christians already had many churches at their disposal in Athens. Furthermore, the evident corrosion of the floor of the Parthenon seems to point to a period when the building was abandoned and allowed to fall into disrepair.595 Frantz suggests that the conversion happened late, probably not until the later part of Justinian's reign (AD 527-565), that is around the mid 6th century AD.596 More recently Mango has pointed to the evidence provided by another source which suggests that the Parthenon became a Christian church in the later 5th century AD, that is immediately after the image of Athena was removed.597 After the closure of the schools by Justinian, Athens was deprived both of its importance and its source of revenue. As a result it went into steady decline. The final blow was delivered by invading Slavs in AD 580-585, who left the place in ruins. That the Athena Parthenos remained in the Parthenon until well into the 5th century AD and that it disappeared from Athens probably before the beginning of the 6th century AD, seems to be supported by good evidence. It is not at all clear, however, whether Pheidias's original statue managed to survive through all these centuries or whether the work was replaced by a copy, at least once and possibly more than once, during antiquity. If the statue was replaced, it would be of crucial importance to establish when this happened in order to evaluate the reliability of later works known to be based on the type, some of which might turn out to be no more than variants of the replacement Parthenos rather than of the original work. The idea that the Athena Parthenos was replaced during antiquity is suggested by two important facts which may or may not be connected: firstly, that alterations were made to the statue base, making it slightly smaller than it had been originally and, secondly, that major repair work was carried out to the building after a fire, long before the temple was turned into a church.598 If the statue base had to be restored, the image itself might well have required restoration too.

Dinsmoor found five Roman style dowel holes with pour channels and two pry cuttings that must have been made when the pedestal was reconstructed with its face set 0.188m within the area covered by the original pedestal.599 Unfortunately, the style of the dowel holes alone does not provide a date for the reconstruction of the pedestal, for the type continued to be used throughout the Roman period. A possible context for the reconstruction work is the major restoration of the building required after the destruction of much of the naos by fire. There is evidence that at least once in pagan times a great fire devastated the building. It destroyed the two great doors, cracked the marble lintels above the doors, consumed the roof beams and rafters and brought the marble roof crashing to the ground. It also caused severe damage to the beams of the opisthodomos and pronaos, to the inner columns and some of the outer columns, as well as to all surfaces that had been close to the heat of the fire. Many of the marbles used for the reconstruction work have survived and they have been dated to the 2nd century BC.600 Dinsmoor first assumed that the repair work involving this material was carried out in Hellenistic times, but he later revised this opinion, maintaining that, although there was damage to the temple and its divine image in the 2nd century BC, the repairs were carried out much later. But, as Leipen points out, the testimony of coins and other Hellenistic objects depicting the Parthenos supports the idea that the Pheidian original could still be seen throughout the Hellenistic period.601 It seems that at a much later period one, or possibly two, 2nd century BC Athenian stoas were dismantled in order to produce the building material necessary to restore the Parthenon after a fire. This included columns, architraves, friezes and cornices for the new naos colonnade and roof beams for the naos. The roof beams were made out of the monolithic shafts of Ionic columns probably from inside the stoas and the new roof was designed so that the naos alone was now covered, while the pteromata were left open. The west door was repaired with reliefs dating from Classical to Roman times. The nature of the work carried out using these materials proves that it was done well before the temple was converted into a church. For repairs were made to both the great temple doors. This would not have been necessary when the Parthenon became a church, for at that point the east door was demolished in order to be replaced by an apse. As Korres has stated, the evidence for extensive use of the east door, which can be seen in the clear signs of damage and repairs to the new pivots of the door and in the deep scratching of the new threshold and the ancient floor, must indicate that the repair work was carried out a long time before the temple was finally closed.602 The date of this event cannot be put any later than the last quarter of the 5th century AD at the outside. It was discovered in the early 1970s that a large number of fragments from the Parthenon, including ceiling coffers and column drums from the interior colonnades were reused in the mid 5th century AD to form the rubble foundations of a stoa on the north side of the Agora. Travlos suggested that the Parthenon was damaged by the invading Heruli in AD 267, when they destroyed the whole of the Agora and much of the rest of the 599 Dinsmoor (1934) 94-95. 600 Dinsmoor (1934) 102. 601 Leipen (1971) 19.

He also suggested that the Parthenon was left unrepaired until the reign of Julian (AD 362-365). This theory is unlikely for several reasons. It supposes that the Parthenon was left unrepaired for almost a century, even though the rest of Athens, except for the centre of the Agora, is known to have been reconstructed from the time of Constantine. There is also good evidence for the uninterrupted use of the temples of Athens until well into the 5th century AD.604 Furthermore, there is no record anywhere that Julian restored and then reopened the Parthenon, and when Julian, Ad Ath. 275A, alludes to Athena on the Akropolis in AD 355, there is no hint that the Parthenon is not open as usual at this date. Frantz points out that such a number of Parthenon stones, about thirty-five in all, cannot have survived together by chance.605 The fact that they are not very weathered probably indicates that the period between their suffering damage in the Parthenon and their subsequent reuse was not lengthy. But she rules out the possibility that they were reused in an intermediate building, as Travlos suggested, on the grounds that many of the fragments are broken ceiling coffers and that pieces such as these could not have been of use for anything but rubble foundations. On this basis Frantz concludes that the rebuilding of the Parthenon probably happened in the early years of the 5th century AD, perhaps during the prefecture of Herculius, the Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum from AD 407-412 and a convinced pagan. Frantz noticed that the reused Parthenon fragments show no trace of fire damage. Although admitting that this in itself is not firm proof that the building was not damaged by fire, she suggests that it could have been damaged either by Alaric in AD 396, when he wrecked much of the lower city, or by an earthquake, of which at least three are recorded in the late 4th century AD.606 If this is true, then the obvious traces of fire in the Parthenon must result from another devastation, presumably at a later date. Against Frantz, Korres argues that a date for reconstruction in the early 5th century AD is much too late to allow for the evident wear and tear to the building after the repairs were effected.607 This is a valid point, if one agrees with Korres and Frantz that the Parthenon was shut before AD 450. But it perhaps loses some of its force if Trombley is correct in his suggestion that the building continued in use for several decades after this date. Several authors prefer to date the destruction, or perhaps only the restoration, of the Athena Parthenos to the 2nd or the 3rd century AD. Thus Leipen, following Stevens, apparently on the basis of the probable date of the peculiar dowel cuttings on the restored statue base.608 Thus also Binder, though her suggested date of AD 138 is given without explanation.609 As mentioned above, there is nothing to prove that the dowel holes were 603 Travlos (1971) 444; (1988) 24. 604 See Frantz (1965) 187-205 and (1979) 399; see also Trombley (1993) 285ff. and 292ff. 605 Frantz (1979) 395-97. 606 Frantz (1979) 397-98. ou/ Korres (1994b) 143. 608 Leipen (1971) 18-19; Stevens (1955) 276. 609 Binder (1977) 29-31.</page><page sequence="166">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 47 not made considerably later than the 2nd or even the 3rd century AD. Furthermore, although it is true that the Antonine period did produce many replicas of Akropolis monuments and that, as Ridgway says, this fact may suggest that repair work was carried out at this time, it is far from certain that repairs were carried out then and that the repairs were so extensive as to mean the replacement of the entire statue.610 A more accurate knowledge of the damage and repairs to the Parthenon itself would surely shed light on the problem of the survival of the statue of Athena, and research into this matter continues. There is no secure reference in the ancient sources to the ultimate destruction of the Athena Parthenos. One passage which may have some bearing on the matter is in the anonymous Acta Martyrům , Passio Philippi , 5. In a list of pagan monuments destroyed by 'divine' fire, the author includes a statue of Minerva in Athens, that is described as armed, with a gorgoneion on her breast and wonderfully decorated weapons. The passage is based on a piece written by Clemens of Alexandria in the early 3rd century AD. But the mention of the Minerva statue is an addition by the anonymous author, who was clearly writing after Clemens, perhaps not before the 6th century AD.611 The description of the statue fits the Athena Parthenos and the fact that the statue referred to requires so little identification strengthens the idea that it was a well-known and important monument in Athens. This source might then confirm that the Parthenos was indeed destroyed by fire. But one is still left wondering whether the statue was burned down and then replaced in pagan times or whether destruction by fire was its final fate. The idea that it was taken to Constantinople and seen there by Arethas in the 10th century AD, as suggested by Dindorf, has no secure basis, for the Athena statue in Constantinople upon which Arethas comments was made of bronze.612 The last secure reference to the Athena Parthenos, Marinos, Vita Procli , XXX, dates, therefore, from the later 5th century AD, towards the end of the life of Proklos. According to Marinos, there were plans to remove the statue from its temple and it was then that Proklos saw a vision of the goddess asking him to prepare a home for her. It is possible that the statue was destroyed by fire shortly before it was removed from the temple or once it had been brought out. At any rate, the complete silence which then falls on the matter suggests that, if it succeeded in surviving this long, the great work of art did not survive much beyond the final closing of the Parthenon as a pagan temple. 6.7. THE SETTING OF THE ATHENA PARTHENOS AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE The architecture of the Parthenon is exceptional in numerous respects, not least for its many refinements, its remarkable use of features that do not belong to the Doric tradition and its faithfulness to architectural forms unique to the Akropolis. What is of interest here are those features of the architecture which demonstrate the close relationship between the building and the divine image it was designed to house. For there can be no doubt that the 610 Ridgway (1992) 135. 611 See Führer (1892) 158-65. 612 See the scholion to Aristides, Or. 34.28.</page><page sequence="167">148 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS design of the Parthenon was in part influenced by the consideration that its naos would provide the setting for the colossal Athena Parthenos by Pheidias. Korres has stated that while octastyle temples were not unknown in the Doric tradition - other cases are found in Corfu, Selinus and Cyrene - the Parthenon is the only example in which not only the outer appearance of the temple but the inner proportions too are altered by this arrangement.613 In the other cases mentioned, the width of the naos is approximately equal to that of the three central intercolumniations of the façade, as in a regular hexastyle temple, whereas in the Parthenon the width of the naos is approximately equal to that of the five central intercolumniations of the façade. The width of the naos is further increased by the fact that the façade columns are not arranged in a regular fashion: deliberate overcontraction results in the end spaces being much smaller than those in the centre. Thus the Parthenon naos achieves the maximum width within the limits of the overall dimensions of the building. It is as spacious as the interior of the enormous octastyle temple 'G' at Selinus, despite the fact that this temple was at least twenty metres wider than the Parthenon on the outside. The internal dimensions of the naos were 19.065m wide by 29.786m long.614 Such an ample naos would have accommodated the extremely wide base of the Athena Parthenos, which measured approximately 8m in width, without difficulty. In addition, it would have allowed plenty of space for large gatherings of people during ceremonies. Mansfield has also suggested that every fourth year a peplos as large as a real ship's sail was presented to Athena Parthenos and perhaps displayed as a wall hanging within the naos.615 An unprecedented feature for the period was the three-sided internal colonnade of the naos. The normal arrangement for temple interiors consisted of a two-storey colonnade down the long walls of the naos, creating two aisles and a wider, central space between them. In the Parthenon, however, the colonnade was continued around the back wall of the naos. Thus, the naos was divided into two spaces of comparable sizes: a wider, central area surrounded on three sides by a long and narrow II -shaped area, that provided passageways round the room. As well as providing a more interesting backdrop for the statue than a plain wall, such an arrangement would have had the obvious advantage of allowing people to observe Pheidias's composition from all sides.616 According to the findings of Korres and Bouras, there is now evidence that the naos ceiling was set at the greatest height allowed by the construction of the roof, a level that was higher than the ceiling of the pteron.617 Following Korres and Bouras, Pedersen gives a reconstructed section through the Parthenon west room, showing the high ceiling level in this room also.618 The use of the roof space to increase the height of a naos ceiling beyond that of the pteron ceilings is not unheard of in Greek architecture. According to Coulton, 613 Korres (1994a) 56ff. 614 de Waele (1984) 116. 615 Mansfield (1985) 55. 616 For a perspective reconstruction of the naos with the divine image seen from one of the aisles, see Korres (1994a) 92, fig. 41. 617 Korres and Bouras (1983) 13, 28. 618 Pedersen (1989) fig. 15.</page><page sequence="168">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 49 different ceiling heights for naos and pteromata were used also in two temples in Paestum: the late 6th century BC temple of Athena ('Ceres') and the early to mid 5th century BC second temple of Hera ('Neptune').619 The former was a small temple, its stylobate measuring 14.541m by 32.880m, and there was no need here for an internal colonnade to support the roof. The latter was considerably larger, measuring 24.264m by 59.975m long, and it was divided into three parts by a two-storey colonnade running down the long walls. Coulton's illustration of a section through the building shows both column levels carrying an entablature, consisting only of an architrave. Korres states that the entablature of the lower level of columns of the naos colonnade in the Parthenon also consisted simply of an architrave.620 He has found evidence, however, that the entablature of the upper level columns was, unusually, complete with architrave, frieze and cornice. He states that the height of the two-storey colonnade was 13.5m and that the ceiling itself was wooden, composed of very heavy beams (70cm by 70cm in section) and light coffered panels. Korres presents evidence to show that the original and more traditional plan for the sculptural adornment of the temple seems to have been to have metopes on the east and west façades alone, with pedimental groups above. The idea of increasing the number of metopes to ninety-two, so that they adorned all four sides of the temple, as well as that of including a continuous Ionic frieze running around the top of the outer walls of the naos, in the manner of a treasury, probably did not form part of the original temple design, but was added to the plan some time after work on the building commenced.621 Considering the contents of the naos, an allusion to the temple's role as a treasury would have been very fitting. The exceptional artistic quality of the frieze bears witness to the talent of its designer and sculptors. But, despite the designer's attempt to facilitate visibility by increasing the depth of the relief from the bottom upwards, the frieze could never have been appreciated fully in situ. Its base was some twelve metres up from the floor, making an oblique view from inside the Parthenon poor. A better view might have been afforded from outside the building, though the spectator would then have been much further away and he would have had his vision interrupted by the pteron columns. The unstinting care lavished on this part of the building is characteristic of the approach taken to the entire project, and it reveals much about the amount of money that was available for the construction of the building. Another very unusual feature of the Parthenon naos is that it had two very large windows, one on each side of the great east door. These windows measured nearly 3m high and about 2.5m wide, and they were set 7.10m above floor level.622 They corresponded with the side aisles of the naos and if, as Korres and Bouras maintain, they were incorporated into the building from the first, they would have played an important part in illuminating the Athena Parthenos. One reason for suspecting that the windows were not added later is the discrepancy in size between the east and the west doors. One would expect these doors to be of the same width, but in fact the west door is slightly wider than the east door. A possible explanation for this is that in the original plans for the temple, 619 Coulton (1977) fig. 26, b, c. 620 Korres (1994a) 56. 621 See Korres (1994c) 68 and 92ff. 622 Korres and Bouras (1983) 14.</page><page sequence="169">1 50 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the doors were of the same width, but the plans were modified at an early stage to include the windows at the east end. As a consequence, the east door had to be made a little narrower. It should be noted that there exists a parallel for the use of windows on either side of a door in an Akropolis monument of this period: the 'Pinakotheke' (which was probably in fact a dining-room) of Mnesikles's Propylaia.623 Pausanias, V.l 1.10, says that there was a shallow pool in front of the Zeus at Olympia which contained oil poured out in order to protect the ivory from the dampness of the atmosphere. He goes on to say that on the Akropolis at Athens water was poured out for the Athena Parthenos, as the problem there was excessive dryness. Although, as Hoffmann points out, Pausanias 's words do not prove that there was a water pool in front of the Parthenos, they do find support in the surviving material evidence.624 Cuttings in the Parthenon naos floor, examined in detail by Stevens, have been interpreted as the remains of a shallow pool set immediately in front of the pedestal of the Athena Parthenos and stretching to the level of the seventh column of the naos.625 Such an arrangement would have left about 7.39m of pavement before the door, according to de Waele's calculations.626 Stevens states clearly that these cuttings must have been made after the bottom course of the statue pedestal was set in place. Therefore, the water pool was not part of the original temple design. But if Pausanias is correct in saying that the water pool was necessary to ensure that an adequate level of humidity was maintained around the statue, then it seems likely that the pool cannot have been added much later than the inauguration of the statue. The enormous change in humidity levels during the summer months would, one suspects, have caused problems very quickly both in the ivory and the wooden framework. The pool in front of the Zeus at Olympia, which was formed by a raised edge of Parian marble, must also have been a later addition to the temple. One suspects that the idea of the floor pool came to Olympia with Pheidias at the time of the creation of the Olympian Zeus. But Pausanias 's explanation of its purpose is difficult to accept. For, although oil may well have been rubbed on the ivory in order to protect it, oil in a basin on the floor would have been useless as a protective measure. The added interest created within the naos by having the great image reflected on a liquid surface must have been great and it is possible that Pheidias wished to recreate the same effect in Olympia as he had achieved in Athens. The purpose of the liquid could also have been to reflect light on to the image. Thus it seems that an idea originally prompted by practical considerations had aesthetic qualities which Pheidias was quick to harness. The sculptural decoration of the Parthenon was no less in harmony with Pheidias' s image than the architecture of the building. Pediments, frieze and metopes all enriched the viewer's understanding of Athena's role and significance. They also heralded some of the myths and motifs that would be seen on the statue within the building. This reuse of similar themes on both the statue and the architectural sculpture emphasizes the fact that the two formed complex parts of one unified composition. 623 Lawrence (1983) 208 and fig. 179. 624 Hoffmann (1967) 342ff. 625 Stevens (1955) 267-70. 626 de Waele (1984) 116.</page><page sequence="170">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 5 1 To run briefly through the themes of the architectural sculptures, it is well known that the pediments deal with the birth of Athena, on the east side, and the contest between Athena and Poseidon for the land of Attica on the west side; the frieze, though perhaps still not fully understood, shows a Panathenaic procession, in honour of the goddess Athena;627 and the metopes illustrate four different warlike themes: on the east side, the Gigantomachy, on the north side, the Ilioupersis, on the west, the Amazonomachy, and on the south, the Centauromachy.628 Several of these themes reappeared on the Athena Parthenos. The goddess's shield was adorned with an Amazonomachy on the outer surface and the battle of gods and giants was painted on the inner surface. The edges of her sandals were decorated with a Centauromachy. In addition, the framing motif used on the statue base, with Helios and his chariot team rising at one end of the composition and Selene with her horse descending at the other end, is found again both on the east pediment (where she drives a chariot) and, probably, on the north metopes. In addition to these obvious thematic repetitions on the building and statue, more subtle links can also be found between the two. The presence of Nike, on the hand of the goddess, is foreshadowed in one of the east metopes where, in an earlier episode, Athena is shown fighting with Nike flying at her side. Nike appeared on the west pediment also, driving Athena's chariot. It is possible that she figured on the east pediment, though too little of this composition is known to be sure. In addition, the four corner akroteria of the temple are thought to have been Nikai.629 Athena's inventions with regard to the horse are alluded to both on her helmet, where the pegasoi remind one that she tamed the mythical Pegasos by inventing the bit, as well as in the depiction of chariots, another of her inventions, which occur both on the west pediment of the temple as well as on the frieze. On the frieze, the chariots refer to the chariot races of the Panathenaic festival and, along with the peplos of the east frieze, they are some of the most clear indications that it is indeed this festival which is the subject of the frieze. The birth of the fully grown and armed figure of Athena, in the presence of the gods and with Hephaistos officiating, finds a parallel in the theme of the statue base, which shows the creation of Pandora, the first woman, also in the presence of the gods and with Hephaistos playing a central role. Athena and Hephaistos 's roles as creators of Pandora remind one of their roles as 'parents' of Erichthonios, represented in the snake at Athena's side in Pheidias's composition. The relaxed and familiar attitude of Athena and Hephaistos as they sit side by side on the east 627 That this is no ordinary Panathenaic procession is clear from the inclusion of a cavalcade and the omission of the Panathenaic ship and peplos, the hoplites and the hydrophoroi (here replaced by young men).

Neils reaffirms that the frieze shows a Panathenaic procession. She interprets the peplos scene of the east side as the refolding of the peplos at the end of the ceremony, after its acceptance by the goddess. 628 The identification of the subject matter of the metopes of the north side of the Parthenon as the Ilioupersis was first made by Michaelis (1871) 138-39. Interestingly, he was able to make the identification by recognizing an echo of the subject of the metopes N.24 and 25 on an Athenian red-figure oinochoe of around 430 BC, clearly depicting Menelaos about to attack Helen (Vatican, 16535; Beazley (1963) 1173, below; Boardman (1989) fig. 309).

The event pictured in the central panel of the east frieze, which has been convincingly interpreted by Neils as the successful completion of the ritual of the presentation of a new peplos to Athena, is probably linked to the Pandora myth which figures on the Parthenos statue base, and which was perhaps believed to give a mythological explanation for certain rituals performed in honour of Athena.630 The central scene of the east frieze is generally thought to represent the arrephoroi and a priestess of Athena Polias standing next to the archon basileus and a young temple-server, who hold between them the folded peplos. It is possible that the rituals in honour of Athena dramatized a myth and, on this level, the central frieze figures may also have represented mythical characters. According to Burkert, they could represent the three daughters of Kekrops, King Kekrops himself, and his successor Erichthonios.631 The daughters of Kekrops were supposed to have made the first peplos for Athena and it was Erichthonios who was credited with instituting the Panathenaic festival. There is a parallel between the daughters of Kekrops, who opened the basket containing Erichthonios, and Pandora, who opened the jar containing the evils which afflict mankind. There is also a parallel between the arrephoroi and Pandora: while the arrephoroi wore white garments and gold jewellery, Pandora wore silver garments and gold jewellery, according to Hesiod. If this secondary explanation of the peplos scene is correct, then it comes as no surprise to find that the little boy enacting the part of Erichthonios is placed next to Athena and Hephaistos. With all its rich array of mythological stories, shown in relief on various parts of the composition, the Athena Parthenos was a complex work which expressed many different ideas, both about the world of gods, and Athena's place amongst the gods, and about the world of men, in particular about the Athenians in Periklean times. By illustrating many of the goddess's titles within this one representation of the goddess, Pheidias succeeded in characterizing Athena and summing up her qualities and her individuality. The Nike on her extended right hand clearly shows the goddess as Athena Nike, bringer of victory, the first known representation of this type. The presence of the snake Erichthonios, rearing up from behind the goddess's shield recalls Athena's role as Athena Kourotrophos, for she was foster-mother to the divine child. Erichthonios also reminds one of Athena's links with the ancient royal family of Attica, and her strong attachment to the city of Athens, for he was one of the early kings of Attica. As Athena Promachos, goddess of war and guardian of the Akropolis, Athena stands ready with her spear, shield, and helmet and the threatening gorgoneion on her aegis. Athena's role as the goddess of work, Athena Ergane, is apparent in the story of the creation of Pandora, illustrated on the statue base. It was through Pandora that work entered the world. Hephaistos created Pandora out of clay and water, materials particularly associated with Athena as goddess of potters, and Athena, along with several other gods, endowed her with gifts and robes. Athena was also especially associated with the craft of weaving. Athena Hippia, the tamer of horses, is recalled by the helmet of the statue, where pegasoi sculpted almost completely in the round, stood on either side of the central sphinx, while smaller pegasoi, alternating with deer, adorned the space above the browband. Athena mastered the 630 Concerning the east frieze, see Neils (2001) and (2004) 43-62. Concerning the interpretation of the Parthenos statue base, see chapter 6.4, above, and Robertson (2004) 86ff. 631 Burkert (1966) 1-25.</page><page sequence="172">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 53 original winged horse, Pegasos, by inventing the bit, and she offered it as a gift to Bellerophon. Her qualities of wisdom, planning and forethought - she was worshipped as Athena Boulaia and Pronoia - are suggested by the presence of the sphinx just mentioned, which sat on the top of the helmet, carrying the central plume. The presence of Nike on Athena's hand and the pegasoi on her helmet illustrate the kindliness and generosity of Athena to men. The presence of her weapons shows that she will also avenge wrongs if need be. Her interest in defending justice and order is forcefully expressed in the depiction of the various battles illustrated on the shield and the sandals which had a clear allegorical meaning, namely "the casting out and destruction of ußpis by the gods".632 Athena is thus seen as a champion of moral law and order. These two contrasting aspects of the goddess, one kind, one harsh, are further emphasized by the action of the goddess's hands, for while Athena holds Nike in her right hand, she touches the top of her shield with her left. Although female, Athena was renowned for always siding with the male and for behaving and acting like a man. She was not born of a woman, she never experienced the weakness of childhood or the need for maternal affection: her birth fully grown from the head of Zeus is the subject of the east pediment of the temple. She did not give birth to offspring: her foster-child Erichthonios, by her side in the statue composition, was created from the sperm of Hephaistos brushed loathingly from Athena's leg on to Mother Earth. She wore the armour of a soldier and, unlike the very feminine Pandora, she was famed for her wisdom. Seen in this light, the Athena Parthenos acts as a potent expression of the importance of patriarchy in Athenian society, and as a justification of the denial of political rights to women. Patriarchy was an important matter in mid-fifth century BC Athens, for the rights of citizenship, which had previously been granted to all who had Athenian fathers, were restricted in 451/450 BC by Perikles to those who could prove that both their parents were Athenian.633 Hence also the importance of autochthony in the composition: both Erichthonios and Pandora were autochthonous figures. As a celebration of victory, the Athena Parthenos bears at least two interpretations. First and foremost, the victory being celebrated in this whole temple and its divine image, as in the Panathenaic festival, is the mythical one of the gods over the giants. It is usually stated that the Panathenaic festival was a celebration held primarily in honour of Athena's birthday.634 But, as Ridgway shows, the festival also celebrated the victory of the gods over the giants.635 Hence the importance of the Gigantomachy theme both on the Parthenon and the Parthenos. On the temple, it was given the most important place amongst the metopal compositions, as it occurs at the east end, above the entrance to the temple. The theme was also the subject which adorned the annual peplos given to the goddess during the festival.636 Significantly, the peplos is shown folded at the centre of the east frieze of the temple. On the Parthenos, the Gigantomachy was to be found on the inner surface of the shield. This battle was one of Athena's greatest moments of triumph. Herington (1955) 61. 633 Hurwit (1995) 180. 634 See notes to Kallisthenes, F52. 635 Ridgway (1992) 127. See also scholia to Aristides, 1.189.4 and 1.197.8. 636 Euripides, Hec. 466ff.</page><page sequence="173">1 54 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS All the gods took part in the battle, but Athena's role was crucial and ensured that the gods were victorious. In Pheidias's statue, Athena is portrayed standing at rest once the battle is over. She has put down her shield, her spear rests on her shoulder, and in her right hand she holds out Nike. Juxtaposed with the repeated subject of the Gigantomachy is the depiction of a Panathenaic procession on the temple frieze. The presence of Erichthonios beside Athena Parthenos reminds one that it was Erichthonios who instituted the festival. At a secondary level, the sculptures of the Parthenon can be interpreted as a celebration of the Athenian victory over the Persians. The mythical battle against the giants was no doubt used to symbolize the recent historical conflicts, as were also the Amazonomachies of the west metopes and the shield of the Parthenos, the Centauromachies of the south metopes and the statue's sandal edges and the Ilioupersis of the north metopes. They showed wild and barbaric forces attacking civilized people. In both the Amazonomachy and the Ilioupersis, Greeks were fighting against barbarians, in the case of the Amazonomachy and the Centauromachy, the barbarians were fighting within their enemy's own territory. That victory was won primarily by the Athenians is clearly stated through the prominent role played by Theseus in the Amazonomachies. According to Boardman, the very unusual presence of humans in the temple frieze and their juxtaposition with gods are probably best explained by the fact that the men depicted are the heroes of Marathon, celebrating the Great Panathenaia of 490 BC, just before they were killed in action in the famous battle of Marathon.637 In addition to the mythological and historical allusions present in the Athena Parthenos composition, Fehr sought a more contemporary message addressed to the Athenians of the mid-fifth century BC. He saw echoes in the Athena Parthenos of the Archaic statue of Apollo on Delos, by Tektaios and Angelion: the large size of the statue, its material, the position of the arms and their attributes, as well as certain decorative features. And these he interpreted as deliberately included in order to convey a subtle political message, justifying and promoting Athens's central role in the Delian League.638 The Delian League was formed in response to the Greek fear of Persian attacks, after the victories in 480 and 479 BC. League members were committed to providing ships or money to maintain a navy strong enough to ward off the Persians. Meetings of the league took place on the island of Delos in the middle of the Aegean, a place particularly sacred to Ionians, and their treasury was kept there too, under the protection of Apollo. Since the Athenians had the largest fleet, they initially acted as leaders in the league, and many other league members contributed money rather than ships for the upkeep of the navy. It soon became apparent that Athens had imperial ambitions and that league members were no longer free to act independently or to withdraw their financial support of the Athenian navy. In 454 BC, the Athenians took the blatant step of moving the league treasury from Delos to Athens, making Athena the chief deity of the league. The parallels with the statue of the Apollo of Delos were deliberately made, says Fehr, in order to invest Athena with the weight and authority of the Delian Apollo, so that Athena would be regarded as an acceptable substitute for Apollo, and so that Athens would be accepted as the legitimate centre of Ionian power. 637 Boardman (1977) 39^9. 638 Fehr (1979-81).</page><page sequence="174">ATHENA PARTHENOS 155 Enough is known about the famous Apollo of Delos from inscriptions and literary sources to be sure that it was created in the late 7th or early 6th century BC and that by the mid-sixth century BC it was housed in an archaic building known as the "Porinos temple", where it remained until at least 302/01 BC. By 279 BC it had been moved to the "temple of Apollo" or the "grand temple" and it continued to be honoured for some time. Thus it is certain that the statue was well known in the Greek world. Nevertheless, one should be wary of concluding that the parallels Fehr draws between this statue and the Parthenos are as close or as deliberate as he maintains. The size of the Apollo on Delos is not known for certain and, while there is good reason to believe that it was monumental, it seems doubtful that it was more than 5m in height.639 The statue, which represented the god naked apart from a belt at his waist, was golden, that is, it was probably covered in gold plates, rather than chryselephantine, like the Parthenos.640 Fehr interprets the griffins on Athena's cheek-pieces as definite reminders of the Delian composition but, as mentioned in section 2, there is little firm evidence to prove the presence of such beasts in the original Delian composition. More promising perhaps is the presence of deer on the browband of the Parthenos. As animals of the hunt they were naturally associated with Apollo and Artemis, not Athena, so at least part of their function in the Parthenos composition is perhaps to forge a link with Delos. One may also consider the position and action of Athena's right hand, with the arm bent at the elbow and the outstretched hand holding Nike upon it, as reminiscent of the Apollo of Delos who held his right hand in the same way and carried what appears to be a sculpture of the three Graces upon it. In both compositions, the kindness of the god towards mortals is shown in the gesture of the right hand, which is held forward offering a gift. In each case the gifts that are offered are not given directly but through an intermediate figure: Nike in the case of Athena and the Graces in the case of Apollo. This kindly aspect of the god is contrasted with their role as avenger of wrongs, which is expressed on the left side of the figure: while Apollo holds a bow in his left hand, Athena has her spear resting on her left shoulder while the fingers of her left hand touch the rim of her shield. Athena also has the serpent Erichthonios at her side. But whether these parallels were deliberate or not, it is difficult to tell. 6.8. LATER REFLECTIONS OF THE ATHENA PARTHENOS IN GREEK AND ROMAN ART Pheidias's Athena Parthenos was the most frequently copied Athena type of the 5 th century BC and its influence can be felt all over the Mediterranean world from shortly after the statue's completion until late in Roman Imperial times. Works which show the influence of the Athena Parthenos are abundant and varied in Greek and Roman art. They include 639 Fehr (1979) 72ff. and notes, but compare Romano (1984) 170-172. A clue to the approximate scale of the statue might be gleaned from the fact that the largest of the Delian temples, the "grand temple", had a naos which measured c.5.70m by c. 11.40m (see Courby (1931) 7), that is roughly a third of the size of the Parthenon naos, which measured 12.2m by 29.8m. 640 For the relevant sources, see Romano (1984) 167-70.</page><page sequence="175">1 56 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS sculptures in the round - ranging from colossal statues to tiny terracotta figurines - and reliefs of many different kinds, in stone and terracotta, as well as coins, jewellery and vase paintings. In some cases great care was evidently taken to present an iconographically faithful representation of the Parthenos, in others the similarities with the Parthenos are very superficial and many details are simplified. Sometimes, no more than an echo of Pheidias's work is discernible, so one can hardly talk of a copy at all, and sometimes the obvious differences in works related to the Parthenos suggest that they are based not on the Parthenos itself, but on some other work reflecting this type, made outside Athens and for a different purpose. The colossal size of the original work, its extravagantly expensive materials, and the abundant use of figured relief decoration make it highly doubtful that there ever existed any completely faithful and exact copy of the Parthenos. Nevertheless, the statue was so well known, so recognizable, and so significant in the Greek world that it certainly inspired a huge number of works which, to a greater or lesser degree, drew on the image of the Parthenos for their particular representation of the goddess. Evocations of the Athena Parthenos in relief can be seen on certain document reliefs from Attica dating from as early as the last quarter of the 5th century BC to the late 4th century BC. Three examples of decree reliefs which copy the Pheidian image quite closely are Athens NM 1474, from 355/354 BC,641 ANM 29 85, 642 from around 330 BC, and Berlin, Staatl. Mus., Sk 881, from 330-320 BC.643 The presence of the Athena Parthenos on such works is important in that it implies that the image was regarded as much more than just a work of art, for it was used to symbolize Athens in an official manner.644 The 641 /GII2 133, Lawton (1995) 96-97, cat. no. 30, pl. 16. 642 /GII2 406, Lawton (1995) 139, cat. no. 132, pl. 70. 643 Lawton (1995) 151-52, cat. no. 164, pl.86. 644 Other examples of document reliefs with reflections, though not copies, of the Athena Parthenos are the following: (1) Athens, Epigraphical Museum, 6615 (FIG. 6.30). Document relief. Probable H. 0. 41m; W. 0.36; D. 0.12m. Marble. From the Athenian Akropolis, c. 427/426 BC. The relief was mended from three fragments, found on and around the Akropolis. It is very battered and weathered, but a small part of the right edge is it preserved. Part of the inscription is also preserved. Much of the surface of the relief is worn away. The relief shows Athena standing on the right, crowning with her right hand a smaller figure, Apollonophanes of Kolophon. At the goddess's left side is an enormous shield, at her right side is a coiled snake. She rests her left elbow on the rim of the shield. She stands with her weight on her right leg, the drapery folds concealing this leg, while her left leg is bent at the knee and set to the side. Despite obvious differences, this figure is clearly inspired by the Athena Parthenos. IG I3 65; Lawton (1995) 113-14, no. 65, pl. 34; Nick (2002) 190; Meyer (1989) 265 A2, pl. 1.2.

The surface is badly worn and shows vertical cracks. The relief is roughly broken all round. The figures are headless and many details are worn away. The relief panel is above an inscription and separated from it by a plain taenia and ovolo. The document is a resolution of the Athenian Boule honouring Dionysios I of Syracuse and some members of his family. On the left is the figure of Athena holding the hand of a female figure representing Sicily or perhaps Syracuse. The goddess is reminiscent of the Athena Parthenos, for she stands resting her left hand on the rim of a large upright shield and she wears an ankle-length robe with a long overfold. She is also accompanied by a coiling snake. But differences from the Parthenos are that the snake is on her right side and that she</page><page sequence="176">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 57 holiness of the image in Athenian eyes is also demonstrated by its use on a number of Attic votive reliefs too, going back to the mid 4th century BC.645 This shows that the stands with her weight on the left leg, which is hidden by strong, vertical folds of drapery, while her right leg is relaxed and set slightly to the side.

The relief was found on the Akropolis and drawn in the late 19th century. It is now lost, but it is known from a cast in the collection of Bonn University. The relief shows Athena standing in the centre, three-quarters to the right. On the right is the honorand, a bearded man in a himation, and on the left a taller man in a knee-length tunic and carrying a shield. Athena is shown in a long peplos with overfold and belt, a shield on the left side, the right arm extended and bearing a Nike with wings who leans forward to crown the honorand. She also has an Attic helmet with a crest and locks of hair come down over the shoulder. These features recall the Athena Parthenos. Her left arm is lowered and the hand rests on the shield rim, but quite low down. Unlike the Parthenos, the weight is on the left leg, while the right is relaxed and set to the side, and she wears a short mantle that hangs down her back.

Other examples which loosely reflect the type, though they are too different to be regarded as copies, include the following: (1) Athens, Akropolis Museum, 3010. Votive relief. H. 0. 44m; W. 0.15m; D. 0.075m. Marble. From the Athenian Akropolis. Late 5th century BC, c. 410-409 BC. The preserved fragment comes from the right lower part of a votive relief. Of the female figure only the left side and the left arm from below the shoulder are preserved. The surface of the upper body is mostly broken away. There is damage also to the shield rim. The surviving portion of carving is still clearly visible and in reasonable condition. The fragment comes from a finely executed votive relief with a standing figure of Athena on the right side. The relief frame consisted of anta and a large plinth. Athena i s shown three-quarters to the left. She stands in typical pose, with the weight on the right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side, the left arm hanging down, and the hand placed on the rim of her upright shield. Athena wears a belted peplos with a long overfold, arranged in a manner similar to that of the Parthenos. She also wears sandals.

Although rather damaged, much of the relief is preserved, apart from a large piece from the left side, which includes the lower left corner. All the heads are rather damaged and some are missing. Athena has lost much of her forearms. The large fragment comes from a votive relief with a standing figure of Athena. The relief was originally bordered by antae supporting an entablature above. Athena stands in a fully frontal attitude on the right side of the relief. Next to her is a low altar, with a small boy standing behind it and a pig to the left of it. Then come eight bearded men in mantles, presumably worshippers, all executed on a much smaller scale than the goddess. The missing part of the relief probably held a few more men. The influence of the Parthenos on the figure of Athena is clear in the pose and the dress of the goddess, as well as in the presence of the upright shield to her left, on which she rests her hand, and the archaic locks that hang down on each shoulder. Like the Parthenos, she stands with her weight on the right leg, while the left is relaxed. The left arm hangs down while the right is bent at the elbow and the forearm is stretched forwards. The goddess turns her head very slightly to her right. She wears a belted peplos with overfold, a front-opening aegis with a gorgoneion in the middle and an imposing triple-crested helmet. The peplos hangs in strong folds over the right leg, masking it completely, while the movement of the left leg can be seen through the drapery and the end of the left foot is apparent too. Unlike the Parthenos, however, this Athena wears a very high belt, and although her overfold is long, it does not reach as low on the leg as that of the Parthenos.</page><page sequence="177">1 58 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS statue was an object of veneration and cult worship on the Akropolis, regarded as different to, but on a par with, the Athena Polias.646 Other extant works dating from the late 5th to the late 4th centuries BC, which use the image of the Parthenos, are numerous plaques, buttons, small medallions, finger rings, and necklace pendants. Some are made of gold, others of terracotta. A terracotta relief plaque from Olynthus, which could be hung up, and perhaps used somewhat like an icon, shows the standing figure of the Parthenos.647 It is thought to date from about the last quarter of the 5th century BC. Many of the details are accurate for the type. The medallions and necklace pendants tend to show only the head and bust of the goddess. The gold medallions from the Hermitage are particularly rich in detail, much of which seems to be faithful. The medallions, thought to date from no later than the mid 4th century BC, were found adorning the breast of a woman in her tomb in S. Russia. Cheaper versions of this sort of jewellery, made of gilded terracotta, have also been found. One such example is now in the Royal Ontario Museum; it is thought to have originated in Attica.648 A very popular form of adornment seems to have been a very small terracotta disc, usually gilded, with the frontal head of the Parthenos on it. Some later 4th century BC examples were found in a tomb near Thessaloniki, and they seem to have been used as necklace pendants.649 A number of similar objects have been found in other locations and dating from the 3rd century BC, showing that this type of ornament was widespread and continued to be popular for a long period of time. Some 4th century BC gold finger rings, now in the British Museum, have also been found, bearing an image of the Parthenos type and in Cyprus an unusual variant on the Pheidian image was used in the later part of the 5th century BC to adorn a very fine gem (London, British Museum 515). A number of these objects were found in sanctuaries, so it seems likely that many of them were votive offerings. The right foot is completely hidden from view, and the left leg is hardly set to the side at all. The belt at her waist is very plain. Furthermore, she has no spear or serpent on her left side, and the right hand bears no Nike. Walter (1923) 34-35, no. 48. (3) Athens, Akropolis Museum, 2435. Votive relief.

Part of the edge of the relief is preserved on the right side, and there is no border, but otherwise the piece is broken all round. The surface is slightly chipped and rather weathered. The figure of Athena is preserved only on her lower left side from the waist to the lower legs. A fragment of a finely executed votive relief with a standing figure of Athena on the left side and a male worshipper, draped in a mantle, in profile to the left on the right side. Athena stands in a fully frontal attitude, with her upright shield to her side and slightly behind her, turned so that the inner surface is visible to the spectator. Like the Parthenos, she stands with her weight on the right leg, while the left is relaxed and set to the side. The left arm hangs down and her hand touches the rim of her shield. Unlike the Parthenos, however, the arm is held obliquely away from the body. She wears a belted peplos with a fairly long overfold, but the belt, which is left plain, is set quite high, thus altering the typical scheme. The peplos hangs in strong folds over the right leg, masking it completely, while the movement of the left leg can be seen through the drapery. Walter (1923) 36, no. 51.

Two statue types which seem to echo aspects of the Athena Parthenos, although they are clearly distinguishable from it, are the Athena Ince650 and the Athena Hope/F arnese of the end of the 5th century BC (Figs. 15.1-2). The Athena Ince owes a debt to the Parthenos in its pose and dress, while the Athena Hope/Farnese has a similar type of elaborate helmet. Another work which may point to a Classical statue partially imitating the Parthenos is the Athena from Palmyra (Fig. 6.19).651 This work is thought to date from Hadrianic or Antonine times. Measuring 2.65m high, the statue is composed of a detailed head of Parthenos type set on a copy of a different and somewhat later body 650 A headless torso found in Rome, Via Appia mile 9, was at first described as a copy of the Athena Parthenos type, but Nick states that it is a copy of the Athena Ince type. H. 1.30m. Marble. Found in 1927 near Rome, on the site of a villa, now lost. Early Antonine. The head and arms, which were inserted, are missing. The right shoulder and part of the aegis and peplos on this side are lost too, as are the feet, the lower part of the legs and the bottom of the drapery. The goddess wears a belted peplos with a long overfold, a small, ring-shaped aegis with snakes coiling on the lower edge and a large gorgoneion in the middle. The left leg is relaxed and set to the side and it is clearly modelled through the drapery. Strong V-shaped folds lie over the abdomen and the belt is knotted in a Herakleian knot with short ends. It is not formed of snakes. Neudecker (1988) 184, no. 36.1; Nick (2002) 181; de Rossi (1979) 237f., fig. 386. 651 Palmyra, Museum. Statue, fragmentary. H. 2.14m (+10cm for the sphinx on helmet). Pentelic marble. From Palmyra. Hadrianic or Antonine date. Missing parts include the left arm and shoulder, parts of the right arm, the right hand, the lower peplos and feet, the nose and most of the lips, parts of the helmet, the heads of all the protomai. There is also damage to the left eye, the hair, the left cheek and the right eyebrow. The head, which was made separately and attached with a massive tenon, was put together from seven fragments. The right arm has also been put together from fragments. There is a hole for the inset pupil. The statue was found at Palmyra in 1975 by a Polish-Dutch team of archaeologists. The high quality workmanship and the material suggest that the statue was ordered in Athens. It was probably made in the mid-2nd century AD, when the temple for which it was made was built around an ancient shrine of Allât. Initially, the old cult image of the primitive shrine continued to be the main object of veneration, leaving the Roman statue a less important position in the sanctuary. But when the shrine was demolished by an earthquake in 272 AD and the old image disappeared, the Roman statue became the cult image and it continued to be worshipped in its sanctuary until this was sacked in the 380s AD. It was found where it was abandoned and it bears the signs of deliberate mutilation. The separately carved body and head are derived from two different types. The body is of the same type as the Athenian Agora Athena, with diagonal aegis, dating from around 420 BC. The head is of the Athena Parthenos type, and it is closely related to Berlin, K 170, as regards the slender proportions of the face, the treatment of the hair at the temples, which is arranged in tight curls, and the type of Attic helmet, with a short neckguard offset from the cap. The Palmyra head, however, preserves more completely than the Berlin example the Parthenos hairstyle, with twisted locks falling in front of the shoulders and a heavy mass of curls on the back of the neck. The raised cheek-pieces bear traces of griffins in low relief. The central sphinx crest support and the side pegasoi, which have been restored from fragments, are clearly visible. The helmet is unique in having the foreparts of thirteen animals above the browband. These creatures were alternately winged and unwinged, pegasoi and does.

Gawlikowski argues that the Palmyra statue is not an "Antonine hybrid creation" but rather a copy of an Athenian statue of Classical date directly inspired by the work of Pheidias.652 Both the diagonal aegis of the body and the triple-crested Attic helmet, with multiple metal adornments, seem to be Pheidian creations. The helmet comes from the Athena Parthenos, while the diagonal aegis was first used on the Athena of the Parthenon west pediment. This figure was also fitted with an Attic helmet, which was made of metal and which may have had three crests. How close it was to the design of the Parthenos helmet is not known. Unfortunately, the head type of Agora, S 654 is not preserved and Gawlikowski's theory remains unproved. An early evocation of the Athena Parthenos in vase painting is the Athena of the now famous bell krater from Baksy in Russia, dating from the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 4th century BC (Fig. 6.78). Although differing from the Parthenos in several important ways, the image of Athena on this vase, standing next to the enthroned Zeus, is undoubtedly meant to evoke Pheidias' s statue. This is clear from the fact that Athena wears the unmistakable triple-crested helmet of the Athena Parthenos, as well as the front opening aegis, and she has an upright shield by her side, the inner surface of which shows part of its painted decoration, which bears the figure of a fighting male. Such a figure could well reflect part of the little known Gigantomachy scene from the Parthenos shield. The goddess's head turns gently towards her right side, where a winged Nike hovers close by, as if to underline the link with the Parthenos. This image is clearly not a copy of the Parthenos: there are too many differences, in the pose, in the dress and in many of the details, not least, the interrelationship between Nike and Athena. Nevertheless, there are enough points in common to suggest Pheidias 's masterpiece, the Athena of the Parthenon. It is intriguing to find that Athena stands next to a Zeus who is remarkably like the Zeus of Olympia, while the floral ornaments of the handles of the vase are noticeably close to the akroteria of the Parthenon.653 Turning to coins one finds that in the 4th century BC, images of the Athena Parthenos are quite common on coins of Asia Minor, especially in remote cities in the south. Prag suspects that political propaganda may have something to do with this, but he also suggests that the coin representations probably reflect real, local statues which copied the Athenian original more or less faithfully.654 This would account for certain differences in details apparent on the coin representations. The earliest example, dating from about 375 BC, comes from Aphrodisias in Cilicia. On one side of the coin is a standing Athena Nikephoros, with the pose and some of the attributes of the Parthenos. Another example, dating from around 350 BC, comes from Side in Pamphylia. Noticeably absent on these representations is the serpent, perhaps because his local Attic significance had no meaning for these cities. An Athena Nikephoros, probably inspired by the Athena Parthenos, also appears on coins of the Hellenistic kings of Cappadocia and Syria, who were on friendly terms with Athens at the time, as well as on coins of Gortyn.655 In Imperial times she 652 Gawlikowski (1997) 25ff. 653 Shefton (1982) 157. 654 Prag (1984) 186.</page><page sequence="180">ATHENA PARTHENOS 161 appears on bronze coins especially under Hadrian, but the coins show a good deal of variation concerning the position and number of attributes.656 In Greece itself, the Parthenos does not seem to figure on coins until the end of the 3rd century BC when, for the first time, a detailed and quite faithful reproduction of the head of the statue was used on the Athenian 'new style' tetradrachm. This image was maintained in more or less the same form until Augustan times and, no doubt because of the prestige of Athens, the same type was adopted in many other places too, including Crete, Macedonia, Thessaly, Asia Minor, Pontus and Paphlagonia. In some cases one finds images of the whole statue on Greek coins, generally with the snake on the figure's right and the shield and the spear on her left.657 Like the image on the decree reliefs, the appearance of the image of the Athena Parthenos on Athenian coins shows that the Pheidian Athena could be used to symbolize Athens in an official manner. The first recorded copies of the Athena Parthenos in the round date from the 2nd centuiy BC. The influence of the Pergamene art collections, together with Hellenistic interest in the theory of art, and the plundering of the Greek sanctuaries by the Romans are amongst the more important reasons, according to Nick, for a renewed interest in Classical Greek art which led to serial reproduction and even mass production of copies in order to satisfy demand.658 Weber tried to demonstrate that copying went back as far as the 4th century BC, with the creation of cult statues in Asia Minor modelled on the Athena Parthenos.659 Nick, however, shows that there is room to doubt that the examples Weber gives succeed in proving her point.660 The Karamanolis head from Larissa and Berlin, Pergamon Museum, P25, are of doubtful relevance since they cannot properly be described as copies of the Parthenos type. The Karamanolis head turns slightly to the left, while Pergamon P 25 has a single-crested helmet and hair on the forehead rather than just on the temples, and the modelling of the neck suggests that the left arm was held up. The other two works Weber discusses are the Notion and Priene cult statues, but whether either of these can be dated in the 4th century BC remains questionable. The fragments of the statue of Athena from Notion-Kolophon on the Lydian coast are little known. They were first published by Demangel and Laumonier, but they have not been studied in detail.661 They seem to follow the Parthenos scheme, though the coin evidence may indicate that the goddess was shown holding a phiale rather than a figure of Nike in her right hand.662 Thucydides records that Attic oikists settled in this place after 427 BC.663 The choice of an Athenian 655 For coins of Cappadocia and Syria, see Lacroix (1949) 278, nn. 2 and 3.

And yet the temple probably does not date from earlier than the Hellenistic period, according to Demangel and Laumonier, so the cult image must surely be dated later. The Athena of Priene is generally dated in the mid 2nd century BC on the strength of the evidence of coins reportedly found beneath the statue base. Weber doubts that the coins really came from beneath the statue base rather than from nearby.664 In addition, she thinks that more important evidence for the date of the statue is provided by the base ornamentation, which can be dated to around 300 BC or slightly earlier. This would seem to indicate a date in the later 4th century BC for the statue. Such a date would accord not only with the style of the temple, which belongs to the later part of the 4th century BC, but also with the dedicatory inscription on one of the antae of the pronaos, stating that Alexander the Great dedicated the temple: it is likely that he did this shortly after the battle of Granicus in 334 BC, at the time of his conquest of the region. Although agreeing that an earlier date for the Priene statue cannot be ruled out on present evidence, Nick remains sceptical about the strength of Weber's arguments.665 She argues that a date around 175-150 BC should probably be maintained on stylistic and historical grounds. The statue fragments are on the whole small and badly preserved and they have not been analyzed from a stylistic point of view. Nevertheless, on the basis of the left foot, which is quite well preserved, Nick thinks a date in the 2nd century BC is justifiable.666 The close relationship between Athens and Priene in this period would be a sufficient justification for the use of the Athena Parthenos image in the temple of Athena in Priene. Nick considers that there is no evidence to show that as early as the 4th century BC Classical cult images were consciously regarded as models for cult images in other sanctuaries. Weber also claims that there is enough left of the cult statue at Priene to show that it must have been a highly accurate replica of the Athena Parthenos, both iconographically and stylistically, even though it was acrolithic in technique rather than chryselephantine.667 She believes that the statue was exactly half the size of the original, that is twelve cubits high, making it perhaps the largest known replica. Such a size would have fitted in well with the dimensions of the temple since the temple was about half the size of the Parthenon. But Nick doubts that the Priene image was as faithful as Weber thinks, and suggests that it is probably reflected on coin images from Priene where an Athena Nikephoros is shown in a Corinthian rather than an Attic helmet.668 Nick thinks it highly unlikely that the Priene statue was made as an exact copy using plaster casts. The smaller size of the Priene statue makes this very doubtful, quite apart from the fact that the first proper evidence for such copying comes from Roman Imperial times.669 From the 2nd century BC onwards, copies of the Athena Parthenos in the round began to appear, acroliths as well as statues and statuettes in marble and terracotta.

Another interesting work from Asia Minor is the statue in Berlin, Pergamon Museum, P 24, probably dating from around 160 BC. This statue was not used in the context of a temple but was set up to adorn the main reading room of the library at Pergamon. The new use is reflected in the fact that the library statue had neither shield nor Nike. It was a large work measuring over 3m high. Polliti points to the freer swing of the body, the deep drapery carving and the longer face as later characteristics.670 He also notes that the helmet is of a type found on the reliefs of the Great Altar at Pergamon. Pausanias records that in the later 2nd century BC a copy of the shield of the Parthenos was made by two Greek artists, Timokles and Timarchides, for the cult statue of Athena Kranaia at Elateia.671 This is a rare piece of written information about the copying of the Parthenos. It confirms both the continued popularity enjoyed by this work even three centuries after its creation and the undoubted fact that artists drew directly on the Parthenos for inspiration. Pausanias does not describe the Athena at Elateia beyond saying that she was armed, ready for battle, so it is doubtful that the figure of Athena herself was of the Parthenos type. Hellenistic statuettes found in Delos provide evidence for the mass production of small-scale copies of the Parthenos type, probably for use as votive offerings in a sanctuary.672 They were found in Delos in what appears to have been a shop. Over fifty sculptures executed in the round, of recognizably Athena Parthenos type, are known today, most of them made of marble. About half of the works are statuettes, ranging from about 15cm high to about 1.30m high. Several are about life-size, and a number are over life-size, but very few of those which survive are above 3m tall.673 Many of the works echoing the Parthenos were found in Greece, especially in Athens, and several that were found outside Attica are known to have been made of Pentelic marble. Karanastassis examined a number of specifically Greek versions of the Athena Parthenos, which are thought to date from between the early Hadrianic period and the mid 3rd century AD.674 The concentration of statues of Parthenos type appearing during this period is interesting in itself. Certain characteristics of these works demonstrate how casually sculptors quoted from the Parthenos, no doubt because the type was so well known and, therefore recognizable, and at the same time so inaccessible because of its enormous size.675 A relief head in the Athens National Museum, 2764, and a statuette from Delphi, 5672, demonstrate just how superficial the resemblance with the Parthenos can be. Several of the works show altered body proportions, with a shorter upper and a longer lower body. This is mainly due to the belt being set relatively high. Such is the 670 Polliti (1986) 167. 671 Pausanias, X.34.8. 672 Delos, Museum A 3416 a and b (cat. no. (6) 54) were found with several other statuettes all made from the same mould; Delos, Museum A 3883 (cat. no.

(6) 38, 36 and 37). 674 Karanastassis (1987) 323ff. 675 Karanasatassis (1987) 335.</page><page sequence="183">1 64 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS case for the Argos, Gortyn, Akropolis and Patras statuettes, for example. The Argos and Gortyn statuettes also appear to have held the right arm out at a wider angle than other examples of the type. As a result, the hand would have been set quite low. The same is probably true of the Patras statuette. The right arm of this piece is entirely missing, but enough of the base survives to show that there was no room on the figure's right for any support under the right hand. A characteristic feature of these late Greek examples is how small they are. They show a drastic reduction in the size of the prototype, with all except the Akropolis torso being under life-size. The Varvakeion statuette survives more completely than most other copies. But even this work can only give a vague impression of the original, for size and material are completely different, and the important role of helmet, shield, base, and sandal edges as bearers of complex relief adornment is completely lost. The Lenormant statuette, which is unfinished, is the only one in the entire group which attempts to give some idea of the relief decorations of the original, having some simplified reliefs on the shield as well as on the base. Considering its small size, such detail is quite impressive. The other works show greater simplification of the original composition, omitting attributes and weapons, and even stripping to the minimum features such as the helmet and the aegis. Of the examples which have the longer, squarer aegis, which is thought to reflect the original - the Skopelos, Princeton, Varvakeion, and Lenormant statuettes - three come from Athens. Three examples, the Gortyn statuette and the Akropolis and Enneakrounos torsos, have a shortened aegis, while three others, the Patras, Argos and Epidauros statuettes, have a variant, collar-like aegis. The Skopelos and Epidauros statuettes have unusual, variant helmets. The Romans were admirers of Greek art from early times, and Greek artists busily produced reproductions of famous works for them, as well as new works in the style of their patron's choice. As Bieber says, the Romans clearly preferred to buy copies of old masterpieces than weak contemporary works, and it is thanks to this preference that we have reproductions of famous Greek works which would otherwise be completely lost.676 Examples of copies dating from Roman times which were made of Pentelic marble, suggesting that they came from a Greek workshop, include the Civitavecchia torso and the Villa Wolkonsky torso. In these cases, the heads are made of a different type of marble. The heads may well have been produced in Italy, perhaps by Greek sculptors. Similarities between the Conservatori torso and the Boston statuette, which were both made in the late 2nd century AD, suggest that they came from the same workshop. In the case of works which differ too widely in age and material to have issued from the same workshop, such as the Madrid and Varvakeion statuettes, Nick thinks that the observable similarities may be best explained in terms of different workshops using the same model, either directly or indirectly through a cast of the model.677 The finds from Baiae show that casts were exported and could be used repeatedly over a long period. Workshops have been discovered in Athens, containing not only unfinished statues, but also casts and tools for making casts.678 But, as Nick says, even if casts were used as models for the main structure of the 676 Bieber (1981) 167. 677 Nick (2002) 183 678 See Shear (1935) 394ff. and (1969) 389; Stevens (1949) 269; Thompson and Wycherley (1972) 187.</page><page sequence="184">ATHENA PARTHENOS 165 work and the drapery, details such as the aegis, the snake belt, the shoulder locks and other details must have been left to the individual sculptors for these often vary considerably from one copy to the next. An important group of works made in Attica for export, probably for Roman clients, are the famous reliefs from Piraeus, products of the so-called Neo-Attic school, which specialized in the revival of Classical art, and which was active from about 130 BC until well into the Empire. The Piraeus reliefs date from about AD 130 and they showed pairs of figures copied from the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos. These panels never got beyond the harbour of Piraeus, since the ship that was carrying them sank in the harbour perhaps after a fire on board. They constitute some of the most valuable evidence available for the reconstruction of the shield. The close agreement between similar figures on different reliefs indicates that the shield figures were, on the whole, faithfully copied from the original. But certain differences, such as a change in costume, the weapon held or the movement of a limb, shows that the copyists did alter details to suit their purposes. For, most unlike the original composition, they generally showed pairs of fighters within the confines of a rectangular panel. It is also noticeable that the angle from which the figures are seen was modified slightly. This was presumably done partly in order to compensate for the change from the convex surface of the shield to the flat surface of the wall panel, as well as to suit the intended angle from which the reliefs were to have been viewed in their new surroundings. One of the earliest proofs of the Roman reception of the image of the Parthenos seems to be the statue by the Greek artist Antiochos of Athens, a work which probably dates from the earlier part of the 1st century AD (Figs. 6.16 and 6.25).679 It was formerly in the Ludovisi Collection and is now in the National Museum in Rome, but its exact provenance is unknown. The influence of the Parthenos is clear, even though the work is far from being an exact copy. Karanastassis suggests that a possible reason for the lack of images of the Athena Parthenos in the early Imperial age stems from Mark Anthony's ties with Athens and the worship of Athena, and a consequent desire on the part of Augustus to distance himself from both.680 Interestingly, the first Imperial coins bearing an image of Minerva also date from the Claudian period. There is an observable upsurge in interest in the Parthenos in the Hadrianic and Antonine periods, when Classical art was particularly popular amongst Romans, and many of the extant versions of the Athena Parthenos date from this time. In addition, Athenian coins of the Hadrianic and Antonine periods often bear a representation of the Parthenos. Why the image of the Parthenos was so popular in Hadrianic and Antonine times is not known for certain. Hadrian was particularly famous for his philhellenism. He spent two winters in Athens during his reign. He encouraged ever more splendid celebrations of the old religious festivals. And a statue of the emperor was even set up in the Parthenon next to the Athena Parthenos. Such interest in the Parthenon and its cult statue certainly followed the trend set by earlier rulers: Alexander the Great had twenty-six Persian shields, taken at the battle of Granikos, in 334 BC, exhibited on the temple epistyle, a temple of Roma and Augustus was erected very close to the east end of the Parthenon, and an honorific inscription to Nero was set up on the east architrave. It is also possible that a 679 Concerning the date, see Nick (2002) 241-42. 680 Karanastassis (1987) 386 and n. 294; see also Nick (2002) 188 and notes.</page><page sequence="185">1 66 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS special devotion to the goddess by the emperors of the period, as well as the setting up of an important new statue based on the Parthenos, as Vermeule suggests, encouraged renewed interest in the Parthenos. Another possibility is that this interest reflects some specific restoration work carried out in the 2nd century AD on the goddess's temple and perhaps also on her image. There seems to be no doubt that the temple suffered severe damage during antiquity on more than one occasion, though it is not yet clear exactly when, and it is possible that the image became damaged too. Many statues of Parthenos type have been found in Italy, particularly in Rome. They tend to be larger than the examples of the type found in Greece. A number of them aie roughly life-size, as, for example, the Villa Borghese, Villa Wolkonsky, Baltimore, Mariemont, Civitavecchia, and Conservatori torsos, and at least two are over life-size, the Antiochos statue and the Minerve au collier, measuring 2.35m and 2.10m respectively. A wide, semi-circular aegis is typical of nearly all these pieces. Vermeule groups together the Berlin and Copenhagen heads (Figs. 6.17-18), which he regards as "strongly 'classical' Hadrianic interpretations of the Parthenos."681 They are noteworthy for their fidelity to the details of the helmet decoration, while at the same time altering the facial features to give a much more slender and youthful appearance to the goddess than one sees on, for instance, the Varvakeion statuette and a number of other representations. Vermeule points to the Civitavecchia-Louvre copy, which was found in the context of a luxurious villa at Santa Marinella, as a more baroque interpretation of the Parthenos.682 The basic type is clear but a more complicated and elaborate manner is apparent in, for instance, the locks of hair on the shoulders, which twist snake-like, the very busy-looking snakes of the aegis, and the stylized snake belt at the waist. Vermeule thinks that this work and a number of similar works that can be grouped with it, all dating from the late Hadrianic and early Antonine periods, are only indirect reproductions of the Parthenos. He suspects that they are replicas of a new Parthenos statue that was made for Hadrian for a prominent building either in Athens or in Rome. Copies of the Athena Parthenos type have also been discovered in Macedonia, Cologne, Cyrene, Crete, Asia Minor, and the eastern Mediterranean. Some copies betray a Gallo- Roman origin. One particularly interesting work from Asia Minor is the Athena from Palmyra, mentioned earlier. This example illustrates well the scope of Pheidias's influence. The functions of the statuary copies are sometimes known but not in every case. Many were found in sanctuaries, suggesting that they were votive offerings. So, for instance, the Kea statuette, the smaller Cyrene head, 14.177, the Larissa head fragment, Akropolis 1362, and the Skopelos and Epidauros statuettes which still have their inscriptions. The Athena of Priene is the only one which was certainly a cult statue. The Varvakeion statuette, which was found carefully hidden away, may have been used for private cult practice. Several copies are known to have been used for decorative purposes. So, for instance, the statue set up in the library at Pergamon (Berlin, Pergamon Museum P 24), the Milan torso, found in the Castra Praetoria in Milan, the Enneakrounos torso and the Cologne head. This last piece, which is of high quality workmanship, may have been commissioned for some public building. From private villas come the Via Appia statue, the Civitavecchia torso and head, the Apollonia statue, the Conservatori torso and the Gortyn statue. 681 Vermeule (1989) 50. 682 Vermeule (1989) 49-50.</page><page sequence="186">ATHENA PARTHENOS 167 6.9.

H. 0. 178m (from lower break to beginning of forehead). Marble, perhaps Pentelic. From Larissa. AD 110-135? The right upper part of the helmet and head are preserved, with left eye, forehead, left ear, and a few curls above the ear. Most of the face is lost. The surface of the remaining part of the helmet is in good condition. The head was found during construction work in Larissa, below the episcopal church of H. Achillios on the Akropolis. The fragmentary, over life-size head represents Athena, wearing an Attic helmet with pointed visor. Holes on the helmet edge in front of the ear indicate that the helmet originally had cheek-pieces. Other holes on the visor and the helmet dome must have been used to attach other ornaments and to hold the raised cheek-pieces in place. Unlike many heads following the Athena Parthenos scheme, this one has only a few locks of hair before the ears and these are very short, not covering the ear lobes. There is a pattern of tendrils in relief on the lower right part of the dome of the helmet. The tendrils and the bore holes on the Attic helmet suggest that this head came from a copy of the Athena Parthenos. Karanastassis comments on the fact that tendrils on the dome of the helmet can also be seen on the Cologne and Louvre heads, as well as on the Aspasios gem and certain Athenian new style tetradrachms. This may suggest that the original statue had such a motif and, therefore, that this head copies the original quite faithfully. Vermeule disagrees, however, finding the piece different enough from the Pheidian original to suggest that the body was a variant rather than a copy of the Athena Parthenos. BIBLIOGRAPHY Biesantz, H.

The torso is preserved from the shoulders to the lower part of the peplos. The surface is rather damaged. The back of the piece is only roughly executed. The head and neck, the arms, the lower legs and feet, and the attributes are all missing. There is damage to the lower edge of the aegis, the gorgoneion, and some of the peplos folds. The remains of a puntello can be seen on the right lower half of the peplos overfold. The torso is part of an approximately life-size statue following the scheme of the Athena Parthenos. The stance, the dress, and the archaizing locks descending from the shoulders are characteristic of the type, but the treatment of details such as the drapery folds and the indented lower edge of the aegis, show some independence. The peplos folds, particularly above the belt, are reminiscent of those of the Patras statuette. The proportions of the body are similar to those of the Patras, Argos and Gortyn statuettes. The belt is placed higher and as a result the upper body appears short and the lower body appears long. Leipen thought it possible that this piece might date from not long after Pheidias, but this seems very improbable. Brouskari dates the piece to the 2nd century AD, as does Karanastassis who specifies a date in the second half of the century.685 She sees similarities with, among other pieces, the Athena found in the pediment of the Genius Coloniae in Oea, Tripoli, which dates to AD 183-184. Nick suggests a late Antonine or early Seveřan date. BIBLIOGRAPHY Brouskari, M. S. (1974) 137, no. 1362, fig. 261. Casson, S. &amp; Brooke, D. (1921) 260-61, no. 1337. Dinsmoor, W. B. (1934) 93-106.

The head and part of the neck are missing, along with part of the plinth, the end of the right foot, some of the snakes of the aegis, and both forearms, which were worked separately and attached to the upper arms with dowels. Apart from these losses, the statue is in excellent condition. There are the remains of three puntelli: one on the right hip, one on the left hip and one near the left knee. The statue was found on the Akropolis at Gortyn in 1950. It is an approximately human-scale replica of the Athena Parthenos. The stance, the dress, and the archaizing 685 Karanastassis (1987) 407.</page><page sequence="188">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 69 locks descending from the shoulders are characteristic of the type, making it very recognizable. The posture and the drapery on the legs recalls the Varvakeion statuette. The sharply cut, raised edge of the apoptygma looks very metallic in character. The rounded lower edge of the aegis, which appears shorter and narrower than is often seen, is reminiscent of that of the Borghese statue, the Minerve au collier, the Baltimore torso and the torso in the Akropolis Museum. The aegis opens at the front and has a wide, raised border and a large gorgoneion, with short, wavy hair, protruding tongue and puffed cheeks. The distinctive snake knot with spiralling ends at the waist is reminiscent of the Civitavecchia statue. At the back the hair is arranged in a neat pony tail, composed of two twisting locks, which subdivide into four corkscrew locks.686 This arrangement is paralleled on the Akropolis torso and the Madrid statuette. Another important feature of this statue was the position of the right arm, which sank at a wide angle and was attached to the hip by a puntello. Leipen thought this puntello might have served to attach the column under the right hand to the statue, but Karanastassis disputes this on the grounds that enough of the right arm remains to establish that it was held quite low.687 Another piece which had the right arm in a similar pose may have been the Argos statuette. Like the Argos and Patras examples, as well as Akropolis 1362, this statue has a relatively short upper and long lower body. Two puntelli on the left side, below the hip and at the knee, probably served to support the wrist of the goddess and one of her attributes. An attribute on the left side is further suggested by the very plain nature of the lower left side of the statue, which would have been hidden from view by either the snake or the shield. The back of the statue is also left rather plain. BIBLIOGRAPHY Karanastassis, P. (1987) 331, 401-02, no. B I 2, pl. 35, 2. Leipen, N. (1971) 6, no. 15, fig. 10. Levi, D. (1951) 356, fig. 49. Nick, G.

UPPER TORSO FRAGMENT FROM GORTYN Crete, Heraklion Museum, no. H 421, eastern store-room. Upper torso, headless. H. 0.365m. Fine- grain white marble. Found at Gortyn, Crete. Late Hellenistic or early Imperial. The headless torso consists of the upper part of the figure from the neckline to the middle of the thighs. The shoulders are missing, as are the right arm, which was inserted, and most of the left arm, apart from a section of its upper part. The surface of the marble is weathered, and it is damaged in places. The statuette represented a standing peplophoros, with her weight on the right leg.

The left side of the sculpture is not as well finished as the right. This suggests that the right arm was bent at the elbow and the forearm was held forwards, while the left arm was held down, with the hand possibly resting on the top of the shield as in the prototype. There are no remains of a puntello to be seen on this piece. Plastically rendered snakes in stone can be seen on the aegis, but small holes below the gorgoneion suggest that other snakes were added in metal. The Gorgon's head, which is relatively small, is of the broad-faced and large- featured type. A date in the late Hellenistic or early Imperial period is suggested by the use of the running drill and the style of the drapery. Romeo points to the rounded folds of the peplos beneath the aegis, which are close to those of the Antiochos statue and unlike the V-shaped folds of the Varvakeion statuette, as well as to the rather thick and closely-set folds of the apoptygma which lack the heavy, metallic quality of certain other copies.

LOWER TORSO FRAGMENT FROM GORTYN Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene, Store room, no inventory number. Torso fragment. H 0.365m; W. 0.21m; D. 0.105m. Pentelic marble. Found at Gortyn, Crete. AD 150-160. The piece was found built into a wall of the Praetorium at Gortyn. The fragment consists of the lower part of the figure from the thighs to above the feet. There is a diagonal break from the upper right thigh to the lower left thigh above the knee. The statuette represented a standing peplophoros, with her weight on the right leg. The peplos was open on the right side, as can be seen from the zigzag of folds on this side. The drapery is close to that of the statue from Gortyn, Heraklion 347, which suggests that this could be another copy of the Athena Parthenos type. Remains of a puntello can be seen at the level of the left knee. This may have been used for fixing an attribute in place. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ghedini, F. (1985) 175ff., no. 35, fig.75. Nick, G.

H. 1.045m; base, 0.105 by 0.405 by 0.33m; Nike, H 0.138; shield, H 0.39m. Parian marble. Found in Athens. Earlier 3rd century AD. The statuette is in excellent condition, with very minor damage here and there. The only parts which are lost are the head of Nike and the central part of the taenia she once held in her hands. Traces of colour can still be seen on the surface. The sculpture was found in December 1880 in Athens, in a sort of brick vault in a Roman house beside the Varvakeion Gymnasium. The statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type, and approximately one-twelfth the original size. Despite the obvious differences of scale and material, and the complete lack of the wealth of relief decorations reportedly to be seen on the original, it is generally considered to be one of the more faithful replicas. The goddess stands with her weight on</page><page sequence="190">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 7 1 her right leg, while her left is drawn slightly to the side. On her head she has an Attic helmet with three crests and a peaked browband. The characteristic sphinx and pegasoi crest holders and the raised cheek-pieces are all present, but none of the other details, such as the griffins on the cheek-pieces, the animal protomai or the designs on the dome and neckguard, are included. The hair is shown as thick, short curls in front of the ears, two long locks falling forward over the aegis on either side, and a thick braid falling at the back. The goddess wears a peplos, which opens on the right side, and falls down to the ground, partially covering the feet. It is tied at the waist and has a long overfold. A front- opening, square aegis, adorned with a scale pattern, and with snakes around, and a gorgoneion in the middle, covers her breast and falls over her back. Except for snake bracelets on her arms, the goddess has no jewellery on this copy. She wears thick-soled sandals on her feet, 1.5cm high, but the sides are unadorned. On the hand of her outstretched right arm she carries a Nike, who wears a long, sleeveless peplos with girdled overfold and has a twisted himation wound twice round her waist and then flung over the left arm. Her wings are lowered, but not folded. She leans forwards and stands on her toes, and in her hands she holds the ends of a long fillet, most of which is now broken away. The feathers of her wings were depicted in dark brown paint, some of which can still be seen. Beneath the right hand of Athena is a column. The base, with its tori and scotia, is close to the Attic variety of Ionic base used in the Propylaia and the Erechtheion. The capital is unusual in form. It consists of a small torus at the bottom, a lower calathus with a torus-like upper end, an upper calathus terminating in a flat fillet, and a square base above. The left hand of the goddess is lowered and rests on the rim of her large, upright shield. Apart from the gorgon 's head in the centre, the shield is left unadorned. Between her left leg and the shield is the figure of the serpent Erichthonios, which is coiled up but with the head erect and looking out. Traces of deep red paint can be seen on the serpent, showing the scales. The whole composition rests on a pedestal, one-tenth of the height from Athena's feet to the top of her helmet crest. The central frieze panel of the base is unadorned. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 109ff., pl. 62. Demargne, P. (1984) 977, no. 220, pl. 729. Fehr, B. (1979) 71-91. Karanastassis, P.

The back is almost completely unworked. The reliefs of the base and the shield are very sketchy and they are in poor condition. Little remains of the helmet decorations and the upturned right hand</page><page sequence="191">1 72 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS palm carries no Nike. There is also no spear and the aegis is left unadorned. It is not clear what the sculptor intended to do with the lump of uncut rock under the goddess's right hand and down her right side. The sculpture was discovered in Athens in 1859, west of the Pnyx. The small statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type, faithfully recording several features of the original statue. This piece is particularly noteworthy because, despite the small scale, it attempts to convey something of the elaborate reliefs which once adorned the shield and the base. Very few copies preserve such details. In characteristic fashion, the goddess stands on her right leg, with the left bent and set slightly to the side. The forearms are lowered, the left hand rests on the rim of the shield, while the right forearm is held forwards, though rather lower than expected, with the palm upturned, ready to hold something. Athena wears a long, belted peplos, with long overfold, square-cut aegis which opens at the front, a necklace, and an Attic helmet, which had at least one central crest support. The shield stands upright on her left side, with the serpent coiled up inside with its head rearing and looking outwards. On the shield can be seen in relief a central gorgoneion with an Amazonomachy raging around it. This part of the composition is described separately, below with the other shield reliefs. The base of the Lenormant statuette is adorned with a small number of figures, no more than six. The central figures appear to stand simply in a line, a feature that is repeated on the only other copy which includes details of the base relief: the Pergamon Library statue. On either side of the central figures can clearly be seen the figures of Helios rising on the far left with his chariot and, on the far right, a figure with a horse, who is most probably Selene. The motif of the rising of Helios and the sinking of Selene at either end of a scene of a group of deities is one which has become strongly associated with Pheidias, for it is found not only on two of his sculptures but also on the Parthenon itself. The statue bases of both the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia - which shows the birth of Aphrodite - use this framing motif. On the Parthenon the motif was used on the east pediment, showing the birth of Athena, and, probably, on the north metopes, figuring the Ilioupersis. BIBLIOGRAPHY Demargne, P.

The surface is in quite good condition. The head, which was inserted, is missing. Also missing are the right arm and shoulder, most of the left arm, parts of the snake and shield, the right foot, and some of the drapery on the lower right side. Most of the right half of the shield survives, apart from some of the lower outer edge. A small part of the lower left</page><page sequence="192">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 73 half, as well as the central part with the gorgoneion, also remain. The statue, along with the lower fragment of the shield, was discovered in Patras in 1896. The larger fragment of the shield was not discovered until 1937. It was also found in Patras. The statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type, recognizable because of the stance, the drapery, the shield and serpent on the left side and the archaizing locks falling on to the left shoulder. This piece is invaluable because of the large part of the shield relief which it preserves. The shield is dealt with separately below, with the other shield reliefs. Although the base accommodated both serpent and shield on the left side, it clearly did not have room for any pillar or column on the right side. Like the Gortyn and Argos examples, this statuette has a short upper body, an effect created primarily because of the higher position of the belt. The right arm is completely missing, so its position can only be guessed at, but it is possible that it was held in a wide angle, like the Gortyn and Argos statuettes. The resting leg is set not only to the side but also slightly to the back. Most unusual is the shape of the aegis, which is not square-cut but undulating on the lower edge, and which leaves the breasts uncovered. This collar-like aegis is also found on the statuettes from Argos and Epidauros. As in the Argos statuette, the gorgoneion is also set in an unusual place, being in the middle of the lower edge of the aegis. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 112, 249, figs. 334-35.

The head and neck, which were worked separately, are missing. The right arm is preserved to just above the elbow, the left arm is broken off at the shoulder. There are traces of broken marble braces at the left hip and ankle, which probably supported the arm and the shield, and traces of another brace on the right hip. Part of the left side of the plinth is missing. There is some damage to the aegis snakes, the gorgoneion, the left knee and some folds of the peplos. The statuette was found in 1956 between the ancient theatre and modern Gounaris St., in the south-eastern part of the city. The statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type, of roughly similar scale to the Varvakeion statuette. The type is recognizable because of the stance, the drapery and the archaizing locks falling on the shoulders. The remains of braces on the left side seem to indicate that the goddess was originally shown with her shield. This view is strengthened by the slight rise in the upper surface of the plinth near the left foot. Traces of another brace on the right side show that the right lower arm was held quite low, in a similar position to that of the Gortyn statuette. The drapery is worked rather freely: the peplos folds are fewer and wider than on, for instance, the Varvakeion statuette, and the folds from the left knee are also wider and more voluminous. The aegis is of the shorter and more pointed variety - rather like the Patras statuette aegis - which leaves the breasts uncovered. Along the open right</page><page sequence="193">1 74 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS side of the goddess's peplos the fabric is shown to have a crinkled edge. This detail is common for the period, but unusual for copies of the type. The shoulder locks are unusually shown as tight ringlets which hang straight. The snakes of the girdle do not twist round, as so often seen on Parthenos copies. Like the Patras and Gortyn examples, this statuette has a relatively short upper body. BIBLIOGRAPHY Demargne, P.

AD 175-200. The head, a large part of the neck, much of the arms and feet, and part of the lower legs and drapery are missing. There are remains of locks on the shoulders at the front and of the long braid at the back. The torso was discovered in 1 894 in the area of the Dionysion in Athens, in a Roman building which contained a great number of sculptures. This high quality torso follows the scheme of the Athena Parthenos. It is like the Varvakeion statuette in most respects, though the aegis is shorter, and closer to those of the Gortyn statuette and the Akropolis torso (inv. 1362). A bow replaces the knot on the snake girdle. BIBLIOGRAPHY Karanastassis, P. (1987) 405-06, no. B I 7, pl. 40, 1-2. Leipen, N. (1971) 5, no. 9. Nick, G. (2002) 238, cat. no. A 8. 11.

The head and the neck are made of a different piece of marble to the body. The locks of hair on the shoulders and some of the peplos folds are battered. The front of the left thigh has been knocked off. There are large holes in the helmet on either side of the head. The work was found in Epidauros in 1886, in the Antonine Baths, together with several other sculptures from different periods. This statuette is a small variant of the Athena Parthenos type, recognizable because of the dress and the stance. Untypical features include the collar-like aegis, with no gorgoneion, the simplified helmet - which is quite similar to that of the Skopelos statuette - and the high-set belt on the peplos. Stylistically, the piece is not far from the Gortyn and Argos statuettes. The base, which is made of grey marble, measures H. 0.05m; W. 0.23m; D. 0.12m.

The head, much of the neck, the arms from a little way below the shoulders and the front of the feet are missing. The torso is also broken just above the waistline and it is quite damaged. The little figure is recognizably of Athena Parthenos type in its pose and dress, with belted peplos and aegis. But the high belt, the body proportions, with slender upper body and heavier hips and legs, and the light swing to the right in the hips, are typically Hellenistic. The front-opening aegis has a central gorgoneion and it is scaled. But, untypically, it is quite small and its raised edge curves in and out. The belt is knotted but there are no snakes and no looped ends. Another difference is that the high position of the belt means that although the peplos overfold is quite long, it only reaches to the top of the legs. BIBLIOGRAPHY Doumas, C. (1963) 282, pl. 327b.

It conforms to the Athena Parthenos type, preserving many authentic details of the type, such as the Attic helmet with three crests and peaked browband, curls escaping in front of the ears, locks falling forwards over the shoulders, and a front-opening aegis with gorgoneion. The lack of a snake knot on the belt is surely a simplification dictated by the smallness of the scale. The modelling of the face, especially the round eyes and full chin and cheeks, shows skilful, possibly Greek, workmanship. BIBLIOGRAPHY Karanastassis, P. (1987) 406-07, no. B I 9, pl. 40, 3.

Like the Parthenos, the head has an Attic helmet with raised cheek-pieces, a large, central crest, and browband. The face also has round cheeks and chin. Unlike the Parthenos, the helmet has only one crest on it, the lower edge of the browband is not peaked and the hair frames the forehead. The head is clearly influenced by the Athena Parthenos but it should not be described as a copy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Brouskari, M. S. (1974) 114, no. 635, fig. 216. Dickins, G. (1912) no. 635. Leipen, N.

Found at Larissa, in central Thessaly. Before 344 BC. The head is preserved from above the eyes to the top of the neck at the front and the right side. The left side, the back and the top are broken away. The head is hollowed out. The nose is broken off, and the lips and left eye are damaged. The cheeks are somewhat pitted. The fragmentary, over life-size head represents Athena wearing an Attic helmet. Dowel holes in front of the right ear may have been used to attach metal cheek-pieces and other ornaments to the helmet. These aspects, coupled with the monumental size of the work (the entire statue would have measured some 2.5m approximately) and the possibility that it was acrolithic in technique, suggested to Knigge that the work followed the iconography of the Athena Parthenos. Knigge thinks the statue was probably used as a cult statue and states that the statue must predate the incorporation of Larissa into the Macedonian kingdom in 344 BC. She suggests that an appropriate moment for the creation of such a statue would be some time after the siege of the Larissan akropolis in 369/368 BC, and probably after 361 BC, when the Thessalian states made an alliance with Athens, against the tyrant Alexander of Pherae. Evidence against this theory is the slight turn of the head to the left, a feature which does not belong to the Parthenos type. BIBLIOGRAPHY Knigge, U. (1986) 143^8, pls. 130-32, esp. pl. 130.

Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. First half of the 1st century AD? The statue lacks all attributes. It was heavily restored in the 17th century. Restorations include both arms. The drapery, the helmet and the aegis have all been reworked, the last two being stripped of most of their decoration. The statue, which was formerly in the</page><page sequence="198">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 79 Ludovisi collection, is signed on the peplos, near the goddess's right foot, by Antiochos of Athens, a Neo- Attic copyist. This over life-size statue imitates the general scheme of the Athena Parthenos in its stance, dress, Attic helmet with peaked browband, high-soled sandals, and archaizing locks descending from the shoulders. The left leg is strongly bent at the knee. The goddess wears a peplos with apoptygma and kolpoi and a knotted snake belt at the waist. The aegis, which lacks much detail, has a raised edge and a gorgoneion with four snakes. The aegis gorgon has a round face, centrally parted, wavy hair, a protruding tongue and puffed cheeks. Later copies, for example the Boston statuette, the Conservatori torso and the Civitavecchia torso, tend to show the gorgon with undulating hair that is not parted. The helmet has just one crest support, holding a massive plume. The goddess wears no jewellery. The curls in front of the ears and the locks hanging down on to the shoulders appear fussy in their treatment. The peplos with apoptygma and kolpoi is fairly standard, but its treatment is unlike most other copies. The drapery folds are deeply cut. The lower edge of the apoptygma is higher in the middle than on the sides and in places it is nicked. As on the Madrid statuette, the hem of the dress does not reach the ground between the feet. Over the right leg, the drapery hangs straight down, unbroken by any fold on the foot. Beneath the aegis the peplos has rounded folds rather than the more usual V-shaped ones, and the typical strong fold descending from the left knee is shortened on this copy, starting well below the knee and leaving the knee quite visible.

Parian marble (head), Pentelic marble (body). Provenance unknown, perhaps from Rome. Late Hadrianic? The head was worked separately and inserted into the body. The string of beads around the neck is in large part a modern restoration to conceal a break. The nose and mouth are also modern restorations. The arms, which were wrongly restored in modern times, have been removed. The elaborately decorated helmet is damaged, with many of the projecting parts broken off almost completely. Traces of three helmet crest supports and eleven animal protomai can still be seen. The statue has no attributes. The statue came from the Villa Borghese in Rome. This over life-size statue, following the scheme of the Athena Parthenos, is executed in rather a cold and rigid style. Typical features include the stance, the snake girdle around the peplos, with its long overfold, the scaled aegis covering the breasts, the complex Attic helmet, and the hairstyle with archaizing long locks falling from the shoulders. As in a number of copies, the aegis snakes appear rather clumsy, as they are made in marble, rather than attached in bronze. One of the most interesting features of this copy is the evidence of</page><page sequence="199">1 80 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS eleven animal protomai above the browband.

The head was in quite good condition when last seen, though projecting details of the helmet were mostly broken away and the end of the nose, as well as some of the curls, were chipped. The work was found in 1885 in Rome, along with the plinth and the left foot, which was still attached to the plinth. The neck was made to be fitted into a statue. The over life-size head is of Athena Parthenos type, but with the face of a young girl. The statue from which it came would have measured over 2m. high. Characteristic features include the Attic helmet with strong neckguard, peaked browband, and raised cheek-pieces, still preserving part of the griffins' legs in low relief. On the dome are the remains of the supports for the three crests: winged pegasoi on either side and a sphinx in the middle. It is noteworthy that the sphinx is recumbent, and not sitting upright, as was more probably the case on the original. Five animal protomai can also be seen above the browband. In typical fashion a mass of tight curls is represented in front of the ears, but the curls that come up on to the browband are probably not copied from the original, though they do appear on some other copies. See, for example, the larger Cyrene head and the Paris head. The details of the face - the rather pointed chin, the small mouth and very fine nose - do not seem typical of the Parthenos, as far as one can judge from the other copies. Traces of colour remain on the head: dark brown was used for the iris in each eye, while red was used for the hair. There are also traces of yellow, black and gold. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

The surface is rather damaged, especially on the left cheek, the lips and the nose, much of which is broken. The helmet decorations have mostly broken away, though the lower parts of the pegasoi and sphinx can still be seen. Signs of ancient restoration are visible in the dowel hole in the nose and bronze pins on the top of the helmet. Found at Amelia, near Orte, in Italy, the head was acquired in 1900 from a German private collection. The approximately life-size head is of Athena Parthenos type, recognizable because of the distinctive helmet. Its Attic form, with peaked browband, pegasoi on either side of a central sphinx for the three crest supports, and traces of animal protomai above the browband are all typical features. More unusual are the shape of the face, with its unexpectedly lean cheeks and slightly pointed chin, and the masses of curls on either side of the face. BIBLIOGRAPHY Brommer, F. (1957) 15, fig. 7.

The arms, which were made separately, are also missing. The statue has no attributes. It was apparently drawn in the Codex Pighius around 1560, when it was already separated from its head. The torso was rediscovered in 1965, after being walled up in an unused area in the Castello Odescalchi, Santa Marinella, amid the ruins of a large Roman villa. This statue follows the general scheme of the Athena Parthenos, but in a rather baroque interpretation of the work. The statue was made at human scale. Particularly characteristic features of this statue include the large snake knot to the peplos, the complicated pattern of aegis snakes and the elaborate, long curls descending from the shoulders. Vermeule groups this torso, reunited with the Louvre head, with the torsos in the Villa Borghese and Wolkonsky in Rome, and the head in the Palazzo Riccardi in Florence.688 He thinks they probably copy a Hadrianic version of the Parthenos.

It is quite well preserved from the shoulders to below the hips. Arms and attributes, except for a fragment of the shield, are all missing. It was found in four pieces on the Esquiline in 1874, during the construction of the Via Ariosta, in the ruins of a villa with a garden. This torso was part of a small statue, which followed the scheme of the Athena Parthenos. It is particularly valuable because of the fragment of shield which was found with it. This fragment preserves part of the lower left quadrant of the shield. It is dealt with separately with the shield reliefs, below. Although the work is dull, it seems to provide a careful reproduction of the type. The stance, the folds of the peplos, the snake girdle, and the archaizing locks descending from the shoulders are all typical. But the aegis lacks much detail. There are several similarities with the Boston statuette, which do not occur generally on the other copies. Notice, for instance, the serpentine locks on the shoulders, the undulating arrangement of the gorgon' s hair, and the arrangement of the snakes beneath the gorgon. This suggests the possibility that the works came from the same workshop or from closely related workshops. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 111, fig. 194. Helbig, W. (1966) 537, no. 1762. Leipen, N.

The statuette was exhibited in Bergamo in 1958, and offered for sale on the Roman art market the following year. The statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type, recognizable because of the dress, the stance and the shield standing to Athena's left. Untypical features include the shape of the aegis, which widens towards the bottom, the high belt on the peplos, the lack of the usual fold descending from the left knee, the very different arrangement of the snakes and the</page><page sequence="206">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 87 presence of a small owl standing by Athena's right foot.

Holes bored above each ear and in the top of the helmet on each side of the central crest show where metal attachments were once fitted. The Attic helmet and the thick strands of hair on either side of the brow correspond to the Athena Parthenos type. The small mouth with full lips is reminiscent of the Boston and Madrid statuettes. The hair is rendered in a rough manner, arranged in waves rather than in curls. The face is also unsymmetrical, the right eye being larger than the left and set lower. BIBLIOGRAPHY Herrmann, P.

Pergamon Library statue. H. 3.51m. Pentelic marble. From Pergamon. Around 160 BC. Both arms, which were inset, are missing, as are the feet and the lower part of the peplos. The statue was erected in the 2nd century BC, to adorn the Library at Pergamon. It was excavated in 1880. This is one of the most complete of the larger preserved marble statues of Athena Parthenos type. It is a free representation, but iconographically it is quite faithful. Measuring eight cubits when complete, it was about one-third of the size of the original 691 Works which cannot be accepted as copies of the Athena Parthenos include the following: (1) Berlin, Pergamon Museum, P25.

It is important because it is the only other copy, apart from the Lenormant statuette, which shows some of the relief figures which adorned the base. The helmet is of the Attic type, with neckguard, peaked browband, central crest and raised cheek-pieces, but it is noteworthy that all the other decorations and crests were omitted. The hair is not arranged in the expected tight curls, which escape from beneath the helmet in front of the ears, as seen on many copies, but in great waves on either side of the face and almost completely covering the ears. A similar arrangement can be seen on the small head from Cyrene, inv. 14.178. Another uncharacteristic feature is that there are no shoulder locks. The aegis opens at the front and has holes around the edges as well as around the gorgoneion, which must have been used to add bronze serpents. But, unlike many other copies, its lower edge is rounded and not square. Bronze snakes were probably added at the waist, to make the central knot, judging from the dowel holes that can be seen there too on a very narrow belt. Although the general arrangement is similar to other copies, the folds of the peplos are treated rather freely on this statue. The apoptygma curves down from the middle. The left leg is almost fully modelled through the fabric. Six figures can be seen on the base, out of the twenty-one mentioned by Pliny, NH 36.19. The frontal figure in the middle is Pandora. To the left on the same block would have been four gods, of which three can be made out, and to the right, five more, of which there are traces of two. Thus there would have been a total of ten figures on this block and Pandora would have been positioned around 9-10 cm left of centre. The reason for this is that the figure of Pandora was set to coincide with the axis of the Parthenos, above. Weber estimates that the surviving base block, which measures 69cm in length, has lost c. 1 1cm on its left side and c. 35cm on its right side.692 She thinks it must have been the central block out of three and that there would have been one block on the left, measuring c. 78cm and accommodating six more figures, and one block on the right, measuring c. 65cm and accommodating five more figures. Thus, the figure of Pandora flanked by twenty gods would have been set along a base of c. 2.59m in length. This accords well with the remains of the foundations for the statue base found in situ. Furthermore, the fact that the remaining block is smaller and less deep than the statue, if the statue is restored with its feet and its weapons, demonstrates that the base must have been substantially bigger than it appears today. A large hole in the top of the base block on the right hand side was probably meant to steady the spear.693 The surviving figures in the relief are very damaged. None of them have heads and most of them survive only in the central section of the torso. Pandora is shown as a small, motionless figure in an ungirt peplos, with her arms hanging at her sides. On the left of Pandora are three peplophoroi. The outer figures both have long veils hanging down their backs and at their sides. They stand with their weight on their left leg, which disappears behind strong vertical folds of cloth, while the right is relaxed and set to the side, its form clearly modelled through the drapery. A strong diagonal line rising from the left hip across the upper torso in each case helps to accentuate the contrapposto. The veil of the outer figure billows out on the left side in a lively way and while the woman clutches it in her lowered right hand she also raises her left hand to hold the veil out in the gesture often associated with a bride. She wears a peplos with kolpos and overfold. The veil of the inner woman hangs down at her sides. Her left hand is 692 Weber (1993) 104. 693 Weber (1993) fig. 27.</page><page sequence="208">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 89 raised and holds something long and flat, while her right hand is lowered and appears to support the other end of the same object. The central figure wears an open, belted peplos with a long overfold and a back mantle fastened at the shoulders. Her left arm hangs down, but the right is raised to her breast. Their heads would all have been turned in gently towards Pandora. The identity of this trio is not known for certain but Harrison thinks that it is unlikely to be the three Charités since the youngest one, in the belted peplos, is positioned in the middle and not at the end of the row, as one would expect.694 She, therefore, inclines to the view that the middle figure is Charis, representing the three Charités, while the other figures are Aphrodite, also representing the Moirai, and Demeter, representing the Horai. The two surviving figures on the other side of Pandora are even more damaged and difficult to see. They both face to the front, their arms seem to be lowered, and the outer figure is wrapped in a himation. Likely candidates are of course Athena and Hephaistos, but with so little to go on one cannot be sure. BIBLIOGRAPHY Harrison, E. B. (1986) 193 and 200. Karanastassis, P. (1987) 325f. Leipen, N.

Three major fragments of this colossal statue remain: the left shoulder and breast, and part of the drapery. They were found in the temple naos. The left flank, the lower legs, the arms, and the head, which was inserted, are missing. Other little fragments, found built into a Turkish wall about 100m from the temple, probably came from the aegis and drapery of the same statue. The fragments were found in the excavations of the temenos of Athena on the Akropolis of Notion. They come from the cult statue of Athena at Notion. The fragments show that the goddess was depicted standing and wearing a peplos with a short overfold and an aegis decorated with metal snakes. A row of holes on the breast show where the snakes were attached. It was probably of the Athena Parthenos type, though its appearance is still uncertain. It is possible that the goddess was shown holding a phiale in the right hand rather than Nike. BIBLIOGRAPHY Damaskos, D. (1999) 172ff. Demangel, P. (1925) 322-23, fig. 1. Faulstich, E.

Temple of Athena at Priene, statue fragments. Colossal. Marble. From Priene, temple of Athena. Mid 2nd century BC. Some have been joined together to rebuild parts of the original colossal statue. The left upper arm has been reconstituted from ninety-three fragments, the left lower arm from eight larger and five smaller fragments, the neck from ten larger and eight smaller fragments, the upper lip from two small fragments. Other parts which survive include the end of the left foot, a fragment of the right foot, part of the left hand, part of the lower lip and a pair of bronze wings belonging to Nike. Part of the statue base too has been found. The fragments were found by R. P. Pulían in the naos of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene in 1869/1870, and transferred to the British Museum. They were published by C. Newton in 1881. The marble fragments come from a colossal acrolithic statue, recognized as a reflection of the Athena Parthenos by Carter. The Priene cult statue is mentioned by Pausanias,VII. 5.5, and it has been thought to appear on Imperial coins from Priene, though the slightly different iconography of the representation on the coins makes this questionable.695 The traditional date assigned to the Priene fragments, in the mid 2nd century BC, is disputed.696 Two ornamental blocks from the statue base, which lay unrecognized in the British Museum for many years (BM inv. 1140), were identified by W. Koenigs in 1983. In conjunction with the evidence from the foundations for the base, it is possible to form a fairly clear idea of the statue base. Measuring 4.55m wide by 5.05m deep by approximately 0.88m high, the base was made up of a core, constructed from breccia ashlar blocks, and outer blocks of marble at the front and sides. The back of the base was left open. The plinth and the covering profile were made of black stone. The plinth had a lesbian cyma, the top was finished with a massive egg and dart. Weber thinks that the statue was made exactly half the size of the original, that is twelve cubits in height. If this is correct, it would be one of the largest of the known copies. Weber's estimate is substantially larger than Carter's, but it is supported not only by the scale of the surviving fragments but also by the size of the temple at Priene, which was about half the size of the Parthenon. Two fragments of the feet survive, the end of the left foot with its toes (W. 0.37m by H. 0.30m), and the big toe and part of the next two toes of the right foot (W. 0.375 by H. 0.30m). These fragments show that the figure stood with her weight on her right foot, the left relaxed and set slightly to the side, exactly like the Parthenos. The feet are executed with great care. Dowel holes and grooves on the left foot fragment suggest that the foot 695 See, for example, Brandt (1988) 237ff. 696 Weber (1993) 99 favours a date in the 4th century BC, but Nick (2002) 194ff. argues in support of the later date.</page><page sequence="210">ATHENA PARTHENOS 1 9 1 originally wore the straps of a bronze sandal. The way the left foot fragment is cut off at the rise of the instep indicates that the rest of the foot was originally covered by the long robe of the goddess. Comparison of these feet with those of the Amazons of Ephesos, as well as a foot from the Parthenon pediments, confirms that they are stylistically close to works associated with Pheidias.697 Of the head all that remains are fragments of the neck (H. 0.513m; W. 0.573m; Th. 0.440m) and the lips (upper lip fragment: H. 0.077m; W. 0.132m; Th. 0.180m; lower lip fragment: H. 0.072m; W. 0.252m; Th. 0.20m). Both of these parts follow the Parthenos closely. There is a noticeable turn in the neck towards the figure's right, as in the Varvakeion statuette, and the lips are slightly parted, as one can observe on the Pergamon Library copy, and Berlin K 170, for example. Evidence that the neck was intended to be set into a separately worked body is clear from the fact that the lower part was prepared as a tenon. The right arm is completely lost, but some of the left lower and left upper arm has been restored, as well as part of the left hand. The left upper arm (L. 1.20m) has been restored from the curve of the shoulder to the bend of the elbow. The inner side of the left upper arm was worked flat so that it could be attached to the body. Two beam holes cut into this surface show where horizontal beams were once fitted from the arm to the central support, presumably. Some of the outer surface of the left lower arm is preserved near the wrist, and this provides the valuable information that the wrist was slightly bent. The left lower arm fragment measures L. 0.760; W. 0.426m; Th. 0.348m. Part of the left palm, with the base of the left thumb, also survives (L. 0.53m; W. 0.47m; Th. 0.301m). This piece strengthens the supposition that the figure in question was a copy of the Parthenos, for the curve drawn on the palm is perfectly intelligible as a seat for the rim of the upright shield by the goddess's side, on which she was supposed to rest her hand.698 The pair of bronze wings (left wing, L. 565m; W. 0.22m; right wing, L. 0.735m; W. 0.25m), which show traces of gilding, and which are adorned with a feather pattern, are closed and must have been lowered. The similarity between these wings and those of the Varvakeion Nike suggest that they belonged to the Nike of the Priene Athena, who would have been about half life-size. BIBLIOGRAPHY Berger, E.

H. 0.75m; H. (head) 0.46m. Marble. From Pergamon. Perhaps 3rd century BC. Part of the back of the helmet, the neckguard and neck of the figure are quite well preserved, but there is much damage to the face and most of the head, especially on the top right side where large parts are missing. Some of the hair, depicted in curly waves on the forehead, can still be seen. Twice life-size, this head of Athena was made for insertion into a statue. Weber has suggested that the head, which she believes is of Parthenos type, belonged to the cult statue within the temple of Athena and dates from before 309 BC. Several characteristics of the Athena Parthenos can be seen in this work. The head is turned very slightly to the right. It wears an Attic helmet, with dowel holes for the addition of metal decorations. Other dowel holes on the edges of the neck-guard were probably used for the attachment of shoulder locks and the tress of hair at the back, a technique paralleled on other copies. The position of the ears in relation to the helmet is similar to Berlin, K 170. For such plastically rendered hair, compare Copenhagen NCG 98. But several features show that this head could not have been a true copy of the Parthenos type. The helmet decorations were simplified and, in particular, there was only one crest. Hair can be seen on the forehead rather than just on the temples. In addition, the set of the shoulders suggests that the left arm was held up and, therefore, that the statue stood in a different pose from that of the Parthenos. The head shows the influence of the Athena Parthenos but it does not copy it. Nick considers that there is insufficient evidence to prove that the head came from a cult statue rather than from a votive offering set up in the sanctuary.

This colossal statue of Athena was probably of the Athena Velletri type, with right arm raised to rest on a spear and the left outstretched, and wearing a himation around the lower body and draped round the back and over the left shoulder. The breast is covered in a large, square aegis with scales and serpents around and a central gorgoneion appears to be hanging from a chain, like a medallion.

Antonine. The face is cut away as well as much of the helmet. Nevertheless, some of the detail survives, including the browband, animal parts on the helmet dome and wisps of hair. The piece was evidently reçut for use as building material, in the Byzantine period. The once richly decorated helmet, with animal crest supports on the dome, executed in relief, and vertical projections along the browband, suggesting a simplified version of the animal protomai of the Parthenos, perhaps gives a slight echo of the Parthenos type. This head, however, cannot be considered a replica of the type. There is no evidence of upturned cheek-pieces, the crest supports are in relief rather than in the round, and the arrangement of the hair, with waves to the sides rather than curls and hair on the forehead, are all untypical features.

The helmet too is very damaged, but enough remains to show that many of the decorations were rendered in relief. There are remains of three large animals on the dome, seven animal protomai and cheek-pieces. The head was discovered in Cologne in 1882. This provenance is the farthest northwest for any copy of the Athena Parthenos type. The head, which is approximately life-size, is a copy of the Athena Parthenos type. The remains of the helmet of this figure are particularly interesting as they show traces of seven animal protomai, depicted in relief, on the helmet. Larger animals alternate with smaller animals, their legs coming over the browband. The browband peaks down towards the nose, in a manner similar to the Berlin, Copenhagen and Paris heads. One can also see the remains of three-dimensional animals carved on the top of the dome of the helmet, the outer ones recumbent. At the back of the helmet, in low relief, is a simple pattern of acanthus spirals or scrolls. BIBLIOGRAPHY Borger, H. (1977) 55, figs. 157-58. Leipen, N. (1971) 8, no. 27, fig. 20. Nick, G.

Found near ancient Heraclea Lyncestis, Macedonia. Early Antonine. The surface is not in good condition. The right hand, part of the forearm, and the Nike are missing. The details of the helmet decoration are rather too damaged to make out clearly. The statuette follows in some detail the Athena Parthenos type, including the shield and the serpent Erichthonios curling up inside it. It is somewhat larger than the Lenormant statuette. The serpent is clearly visible as the shield is angled so that the inside is turned slightly more towards the spectator than, for example, the shield of the Varvakeion statuette. Snake bracelets are carved on both the upper and lower arms of Athena. The snakes of the aegis were made in metal and applied, but those of the girdle and the decorations of the helmet were made in marble. The outer surface of the shield is unadorned, apart from a central gorgoneion. The shape of the aegis, which is front-opening and has a pointed lower edge, is not dissimilar to that of the Madrid statuette, while the lower edge of the peplos overfold is similar to that of the Gortyn statue.

It is not square-cut, however, but rounded along the two lower front edges. The statuette is signed by Euhemeros of Athens. BIBLIOGRAPHY Karanastassis, P.

From Apollonia, Libya; recovered from underwater area of the ancient harbour. Antonine. The statue has lost its head and arms from above the elbows, as well as the end of the right foot. The head and forearms were originally inserted. There is some damage to the toes of the left foot, the arm stumps and the lower folds of the peplos. The work has suffered badly from water erosion, especially at the front, and pebbles are embedded in the peplos folds. The aegis is very damaged and the central gorgoneion can be made out only in outline. The plinth, which does not extend beyond the edge of the peplos, has either been cut back or it is broken all round. In stance and attire, this small statue conforms to the Athena Parthenos type. The aegis, which forms two convex curves at the front and three concave curves at the back, is large and does not model the breasts. It seems to lack snakes. Unlike more faithful copies of the type, this figure has no locks of hair falling forwards over the shoulders, no knot of snake heads at the front of the belt and no fold of drapery descending vertically from the left knee. McAleer suggests that the work is dependent on a late 5th century copy of the Athena Parthenos rather than on the original. BIBLIOGRAPHY McAleer, J. P. (1978) 3ff., no. 1, pl. 1, 1-3. Nick, G.

BOSTON STATUETTE (Figs. 6.6-7) Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, 1980.196. Statue. H. 1.54m. Hymettan marble. Provenance unknown. AD 193-200. Both arms are missing. A hole on the left side of the plinth shows where a second block was once attached, to support the snake and shield, which are also missing. Another hole on the top of the plinth on the left side must once have steadied the spear. The head was worked separately for insertion. The head and the neck are carved in a softer block of marble than the rest of the figure. Some of the helmet adornments have broken off. There is also damage to the left shoulder. A bronze dowel in this area shows that the piece was damaged and repaired in antiquity. Restorations to the face include the tip of the nose, the left nostril, some of the left eyelid, the lower lip, the tip of the chin. Other restorations include the curl of hair on the right side of the neck, and some of the curved lower end of the helmet. The torso is unrestored. Traces of red paint can be seen on the hair. A measuring point remains on the dress folds under the belt on the right side. The statuette was acquired from a private collection in Germany. This work follows the scheme of the Athena Parthenos. It was made at human scale. The helmet is relatively well preserved and shows a faithful reproduction of many of the original details. The two pegasoi on either side of a sphinx on the dome of the helmet can still be made out, though the projecting parts are mostly broken off. The upturned cheek- pieces are adorned with rampant griffins in relief. There are also the remains of some animal protomai above the peaked browband. Although agreeing with other copies in general layout, the hairstyle reflects Roman tastes and influence. The curls in front of the ears are relatively much larger than those of, for example, the Varvakeion statuette, and locks curling up on to the browband have been added. These features are very close to the Louvre head. The long locks falling forwards from the shoulders are very twisted and serpentine, like those of the Civitavecchia torso and the braid at the back is organized into five careful ringlets. The layout of the peplos folds is quite close to that seen on the Varvakeion statuette, and the aegis and snake belt are similar too. With respect to the snake knot at the waist, the hair on the shoulders, the peplos folds, and the gorgon's head, this piece is closest to the Conservatori torso. BIBLIOGRAPHY Fehl, P. (1961) 29-33.

The eyeballs, which were inlaid, are also missing. Given the type of marble, it seems probable that the work was made in Italy. The statuette is of the Athena Parthenos type. It is close in scale and drapery to the Varvakeion statuette, but with very elegant proportions. The aegis is square in shape, and drill holes along the edges show where metal snakes were once added. Drill holes along the front of the helmet indicate that some of the helmet decorations were made of metal too. The face is long and narrow in its proportions. The breasts are prominently modelled through the aegis, in untypical fashion. Another interesting difference is that the skirt edge does not touch the ground between Athena's feet, as one sees on so many copies. In the original statue, the skirt probably did touch the ground, in order to help support the enormous weight of the statue above. As in the Gortyn statue and the Akropolis torso, the hair is not in the usual single, thick braid down the back, but arranged in separate corkscrew locks. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. (1893-1940) 1514-515.

Provenance unknown. Mid 3rd century AD. The statuette has lost its head, the right arm from just a little below the shoulder, and the left arm from above the elbow to the hand. There is some damage to the edge of the shield and the peplos folds over the knees. The statuette was acquired on the Basel art market. The Athena Parthenos type is recognizable from the stance and dress of the figure. The goddess stands with her left hand on the upright shield at her side and a long, thin snake curls up its outer face. The square aegis with spiralling snakes is reminiscent of that of the Varvakeion statuette, though in this case the neckline is round and there is no front opening. The belt is thickly knotted at the front and there are no loose ends to hang down or form a bow. In size and date, it is very close to the Akropolis head, 647, but the quality of the two pieces is quite different. The Stockholm statuette betrays a provincial style which is heavy and rather lifeless. BIBLIOGRAPHY Nick, G. (1997) 46ff., figs. 1-6. Nick, G. (2002) 252, cat. no.

Found in a riverbed near Stradella in Italy in 1828. Antonine. The statuette is very well preserved. It is a dim reflection of the Athena Parthenos type. The figure stands on a small round base and has no attributes. She wears a front-opening aegis, with a gorgoneion in the middle, snakes around and a scale pattern covering it. The aegis is rather smaller than is typical. The pose is reminiscent of that of the Parthenos in that the left arm hangs down with the thumb of the hand separated from the fingers, and the right hand is placed palm up. The left leg is also relaxed and set to one side. But, unlike the Parthenos, this figure has the right arm held quite low, and the left foot is noticeably set back. The high belt and the set of the peplos folds are quite different from those of the Parthenos type. The characteristic fold falling downwards from the left knee is absent. Although triple-crested, the helmet bears little relation to the complicated, animal covered head-gear of the Parthenos. It lacks not only crest supports and animal protomai, but also cheek-pieces.

CARNUNTUM HEAD Austria, Museum Carnuntinum, 11927. Bronze head from a statuette. H. 7.1cm. Bronze. From ancient Carnuntum, found in 1903. Roman Imperial work. The head is very well preserved, though the crests of the helmet, the upper part of the sphinx, the inlaid irises, and the silver inlay from the brows, lips and the recesses on the browband, are missing. This work was finely made. 699 The Konya Museum bronze statuette is not included in the catalogue because it is probably a fake. Fleischer, who studied the piece carefully, has doubts about its authenticity because of its technique and patina. Its provenance is unknown. It was acquired in 1939 in Nizip, close to the Turkish-Syrian border, and it is supposed to have been found locally. Until recently it was in the collection of Izzet Koyunoglu in Konya. It is now in the storerooms of Konya Museum. This work is a solid cast bronze, weighing 1.98kg and measuring 0.239m. The statuette lacks forearms, and it has no attributes. Many of the details, such as the helmet, the aegis and the face, are indistinct. The statuette imitates the Athena Parthenos type. Noticeable differences from the type, however, include the rather swinging pose, which is especially evident from back view, the lack of a tress of hair in the centre back, and the very odd shape of the helmet. The cheek-pieces are set much too high up, for they are attached to the dome of the helmet. The crest support animals have no wings or hind parts, and they merge with the crests which then continue down to the neck forming a very dominant pattern on the back of the helmet.

It is made of bronze; the eyes and eyebrows, the lips, and the ornament on the browband were originally inlaid with silver. The head was probably let into a herm. The helmet is of Attic type, but with a short neckguard, a browband which peaks upwards and downwards and which terminates in a volute on either side. This decoration seems to replace the upturned cheek-pieces of the original design. The helmet is plain apart from a tendril motif on the browband and the three crest supports, which are very large. Dowel holes in the backs of the crest supports show where the plumes were once set. The crest supports show some simplification in that the sphinx is wingless, and the pegasoi have outer wings only. The chin and lower face are well rounded, the eyes are large and almond-shaped, beneath high-arched eyebrows, and the nose and mouth are small. Thick, waved locks run from the temples to the ears, which are half covered by the hair, before disappearing beneath the helmet. On the nape of the neck the hair is arranged in five thick waves of hair, which are quite short. The hairstyle is reminiscent of Antonine fashions. BIBLIOGRAPHY Fleischer, R.

The statuette has not been seen for the past ten to fifteen years. It is a variant of the Athena Parthenos type, set on a high, round base. Typical features include the three-crested helmet, the shield standing on the goddess's left side and the aegis with gorgoneion. But the figure differs from the type in several important respects. Athena's proportions are rather too slim. The folds of the peplos are treated archaistically and the belt is set very high. The right forearm is held quite low and it bears a patera instead of a Nike. The shield is positioned so that the exterior is turned towards the viewer. BIBLIOGRAPHY Leipen, N.

It is one of the smallest terracotta statuettes of the Athena Parthenos type. The front was moulded, the back was added by hand. The work is crude, but the type is recognizable from the complicated helmet, the shield standing on the left side, the stance of the goddess, and her aegis with gorgoneion. Like the Oxford statuette, but in untypical manner, this figure has a high-girt chiton, she holds a patera in the right hand, and her shield is turned so that only the outer surface is visible from the front. Equally untypical is the very high, square base on which the goddess is set, the arrangement of the peplos overfold, and the broad, ugly face of the goddess. BIBLIOGRAPHY Leipen, N.

All the pieces were at the eastern edge of the street which separates the Stoa of Antigonos Gonatas from the Agora of the Italians. The statuettes perhaps came from a shop rather than a workshop as no moulds or oven were found in the vicinity. The Parthenos type is clearly recognizable from the stance of the figure, the position of the right forearm which is held out with the palm of the hand up, the front-opening aegis with gorgoneion and the fragmentary remains of a shield with a figured decoration on the outer side. The helmet has a very large crest on the top and decorations on the front. BIBLIOGRAPHY Demargne, P. (1984) LI MC II Athena, no. 192. Laumonier, A. (1956) 115, no. 286, pl. 29. Nick, G.

It was recorded as in the ruins of a Capuchin cloister by the Lysikrates monument in 1867. The relief shows Athena in profile to the right. On her left is a mounted rider with his horse rearing, while on her right is the small figure of Philiskos Lykon of Sestos (in the Thracian Hellespont), who is being honoured for giving to Athens information about the fleet of Byzantion in 356 BC. The figure of Athena is very worn but the outline is clear and it is obviously dependent on the Parthenos type. On her extended right lower arm the goddess held a winged Nike, while on her left side was an upright shield, with a snake coiled within it. This is one of the earliest known representations of the serpent on the left side of the goddess. Athena stands with her weight on her right leg, with the left relaxed and set slightly forwards. She wore a helmet on her head but it is too damaged to show any details. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gulaki- Voudra, A. (1992) 867, no. 190. /GII2 133. Karouzou, S. (1968) 130-31, pl. 41. Lawton, C. L.

This is an honorary decree for a man from Kroton. The relief shows two figures: an Athena of the Parthenos type on the right and on the left a bearded man in a himation, who leans on his staff. This figure is on the same scale as the goddess, so he should probably be identified as Asklepios, a famous representative of Kroton. Athena is shown standing three-quarters to the left and wearing a high-girt peplos. She rests her weight on the right leg, with the left relaxed and bent at the knee. She has her shield by her left side and her hand rests on it, while the right lower arm is advanced, holding a small frontal Nike with wings extended and right hand raised. A large, coiled snake is under the goddess's right arm, its head raised high, just beneath the right wrist. Athena wears a large helmet, but it is worn and damaged. She also wears an aegis.

From Athens. 350-300 BC. Most of the relief panel is preserved, but some of the frame is missing. The surface is very worn. The relief was acquired through Schaubert or Ross in 1846. The relief panel is bordered on the right by an anta supporting a pediment and below by a cymation. It came from an honorary decree perhaps for a priestess of Athena. On the right is a figure of Athena of Parthenos type. The goddess stands with her weight on her right leg, the left relaxed and set slightly to the side. Her right arm is bent at the elbow and held out supporting a Nike who holds a taenia. Her left arm is lowered and the hand rests on a shield that is placed to her left. She wears a girdled peplos with a long overfold. There is no snake or spear, however, and the folds of the lower peplos are untypical. An important feature of this relief is the unobtrusive presence of a column beneath the right hand of Athena. The column is sketchily rendered. No base can be discerned. Some lightly scored lines on the left side at the top suggest an echinus with an abacus above. The honorand, who stands to the left of the goddess and is being crowned by Nike, is a small figure who raises her right hand in adoration and holds a large key in her left hand.

H. 0.52m; W. 0.50m; D. 0.10m. Marble. From the Athenian Akropolis. Around 340 BC. Three fragments are preserved from a relief, much of which is missing. Parts of the top of the relief, with architrave, and some of the right side survive. The bottom of the relief panel remains at the feet of the goddess alone. In addition to the almost complete figure of Athena, who has lost most of her right arm, one can also see the head of a bearded human and much of a small figure of Nike hovering close by, and holding a taenia. The fragments come from a votive relief with a standing figure of Athena, of Parthenos type, on the right side. The relief was originally bordered by antae supporting an entablature with antefixes. Athena is shown standing three-quarters to the left. The pose of the goddess, with the weight on the right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side, and the left arm hanging down, with the hand placed on the rim of her upright shield, is true to type. But the right arm seems to have been extended forwards, towards the honorand, rather than being held down against the side in the upper part and bent at the elbow. The arrangement of the peplos, with strong folds on the supporting leg while the shape of the relaxed leg appears through the cloth, is reminiscent of the type. On the upper body there are also the familiar hanging folds on each side, the belt and an overfold. But the belt is set quite high, the overfold appears shorter than on many other examples of the type, and the details of the folds are different. Athena also wears a front-opening aegis with a gorgoneion in the middle. The aegis is cut quite square and it covers the breasts in typical fashion. The helmet deviates considerably from the type in that it is very plain and has only one central crest with no support. Some details of the type are missing, for example, the snakes of the belt, and the shoulder locks. BIBLIOGRAPHY Nick, G. (2002) 168, 177, 193, 255, cat. no. A 58. Walter, O. (1923) 27-28, no. 38. 61.

The face of the goddess is seen in three-quarter view while the crest is shown in profile. Although not faithful to the Parthenos type in many details, including the wide face of the goddess with a curling fringe of hair, the presence of the griffin, the raised and adorned cheek-pieces and the decorated browband all belong to the type.

ADANA ALTAR RELIEF Adana, Regional Museum. Altar. H. 0.64m (altar); H. 0.27m (Athena). Limestone. Found at Dokuz tekne, nr. Selimiye in Turkey. Mid 2nd century AD. The relief on the altar is in fairly good condition, though the surface is worn and indistinct in places. The lower left arm, part of the right side of the head and the face of the goddess are missing. Her right hand, face, helmet, gorgoneion and the face of Nike are very worn. The shield is very damaged. The altar was found in a field in 1974, about 15-20km south- east of Ceyhan in Cilicia, Asia Minor. The circular altar bears a high relief decoration showing Athena with Nike on her right hand, in the manner of the Athena Parthenos. Athena is shown facing to the left. Her arm positions, and stance, her dress and the Nike and shield by her side are all reminiscent of the Parthenos. But there are some notable differences too. The peplos swirls over the goddess's legs as if windswept; the spear on the left side stands away from the goddess; she has no snake to accompany her; her helmet has a single high crest and looks Romanized; she wears a large one-piece aegis; her proportions are squat; there is a globe under Nike's feet on Athena's right hand and Nike, who is apparently flying away from the goddess, holds a palm branch and a wreath. Prag suggests that these changes to the type - which can be paralleled on local coins - point to a common Cilician or Pamphylian original, or received type, based on the Athena Parthenos, and that either this statue or its image on local coins, rather than the Athena Parthenos itself, influenced the figure on the Adana altar.

End of 2nd century AD. The relief has been put together from seventeen fragments. A figure of Athena stands on the right side with her sacred olive tree on the left. The head and neck of the figure, the helmet, apart from the top of the plume, the right arm and the legs from the thighs are all missing. So too is the lower half of the shield and most of the olive tree. Beneath the relief is an inscription stating that the work is an offering from Silia Ammion. Standing on rocky ground, and facing to her right, the goddess stands in Parthenos pose and dress, her left hand lightly touching the upright shield at her side and the spear resting on her upper left arm. Unlike the Parthenos type, Athena has no aegis, the peplos is tied with a knotted belt but there are no snakes and the belt is set high, there is only one crest on the helmet and the shield is plain except for a central gorgoneion. There is no sign of a serpent near the shield. BIBLIOGRAPHY Hepding, H. (1910) 51 If., pl. 28, 2. Nick, G. (2002) 256, cat. no. A 62. Terracotta Reliefs 65. FRAGMENT OF A PLAQUE FROM ATHENIAN AGORA Athens, Agora Museum, L 3703. Plaque fragment. Max. dimension, 0.084m. Terracotta, unglazed. From the Athenian Agora, 1939. 3rd century AD. The fragment, of unglazed, dark buff clay, is broken all round, but the remaining surface is well preserved. It was possibly part of a lamp or a decorative medallion, adorned with the head in profile to the left of the Athena Parthenos. The type is clearly recognizable because of the Attic helmet with raised and decorated cheek-pieces, the pegasos on the side of the dome of the helmet, the decorated browband, the thick curls in front of the ears, and the cluster earring. Details which are not true to the type include the decorations on the browband (flowers instead of animal protomai) and on the cheek-pieces (man with a club instead of rampant griffins: compare the fragment of a mould for a plaque from the Athenian Agora, T 2376). There is also no scale design on the neck-piece. The tendrils on the dome may reflect the type, for tendrils can be seen on other pieces of the same type: compare the Larissa head, of Imperial date, the Cologne and Louvre heads, T2376, the Aspasios gem and certain Athenian "new style" tetradrachms.

Red jasper, intaglio. Provenance unknown. 1st century BC, made by Aspasios. The gem is well preserved. It was made by Aspasios, presumably a Greek freedman. Known about as early as 1669, it was once in the possession of Prince Rondanini and of Cardinal Ottoboni. It was returned to Rome by the Austrians after the Second World War. The oval gem is adorned with the bust of the Athena Parthenos type, rendered in great detail. The head is shown in profile to the right, while the bust is shown in three-quarter view. In typical fashion, the helmet has three crests, supported by a central sphinx and two pegasoi, raised cheek-pieces, adorned with rampant griffins, animal protomai at the front, tendrils on the dome and a neckguard which is strongly offset from the dome and adorned with a scale pattern. The face is marked by strong features and full cheeks. Part of the spear is visible on the left side of the figure and an aegis snake is wrapped around it. The aegis is opens at the front, it has a scale pattern, a very ugly gorgon in the centre and snakes around the edge. It is rather short, but this is due to the confines of the oval format. The goddess also wears cluster earrings, a triple necklace and a bracelet on her upper right arm. The hair is arranged in thick curls before the ears, with heavy ringlets on the front of each shoulder and a thick braid down the back. Many of these details are repeated on other works imitating this type. Behind the crest is the inscription AZFIAEIOY, of Aspasios. BIBLIOGRAPHY Canciani, F. (1984) LIMC Athena/Minerva, no. 13.

They were found in 1830 adorning a female skeleton in a tomb in the Koul-Oba tumulus near Kertch. The two gold medallions with pendants are adorned with the head of the Athena Parthenos type in three-quarter view. The images are worked in mirror image on the two pieces. The type is recognizable because of the crested helmet with sphinx and pegasoi as supports, upturned cheek-pieces with rampant griffins, a browband with the heads of ten animal protomai above it, a triple necklace and earrings. The spear is held by an aegis snake on the left shoulder, an interesting detail occasionally seen elsewhere. More unusual is the spiral motif seen on the browband and the fact that the browband only peaks upwards. Other unusual features are the owl perched on a cheek-piece, the lack of any foreparts to the animal protomai, and the arrangement of the hair: as well as the thick bunches of curls in front of the ears, there are waves of hair running from the temples to the sides of the head, and two tight corkscrew curls on each shoulder.

The medallion is broken into two halves. The bottom part is missing, the upper part of the left half is chipped. Remains of a bronze wire loop for attachment can be seen in the back. The piece was acquired in the early 1960's by F. Crane, with a group of chiefly Attic 5th century BC material. It was donated by Crane to the Royal Ontario Museum. The medallion is adorned with the head of Athena Parthenos, turned slightly to its right, and resembling in many respects the gold medallions in the Hermitage. The face shows traces of white slip, but the rest of the medallion seems to have been gilded. The helmet, with its three crests, its raised cheek-pieces, and its animal protomai (five can be made out), is recognizably that of the Parthenos. But the image is further embellished by an owl, sitting on the edge of the right cheek-piece, and small figures of Nike holding a fillet on each side of the neck. As on the Hermitage medallions, Athena has heavy features, she is shown wearing a triple necklace, and she has locks of hair rising on to the browband of the helmet as well as longer locks falling in the usual manner on to the shoulders.

As on the Hermitage medallions, Athena has heavy features, she is shown wearing a triple necklace, and she has locks of hair rising on to the browband of the helmet as well as longer locks falling in the usual manner on to the shoulders. The metallic treatment of the hair is noteworthy and Leipen suggests that the mould for the medallion may have been taken from a decoration on some metal object. As on the Hermitage medallions, Athena's browband is straight and not peaked towards the nose, as is the case on most copies, and the spear is entwined by one of the aegis snakes. The snake would</page><page sequence="232">ATHENA PARTHENOS 2 1 3 have provided a way of supporting the spear at shoulder level, and Leipen includes this detail in her reconstruction.

The triple-crested helmet, with sphinx and pegasoi, and upturned cheek-pieces, is clearly recognizable. The goddess has pendant earrings, rather than the more usual cluster earrings. The wavy locks hanging down on either side of the face give rather an untidy appearance. The more usual arrangement is archaizing locks from the back of the head resting on the shoulders.

The mould is very well preserved. It was found in the American excavations in Corinth in 1908. The oval mould shows the bust of the Athena Parthenos, seen from the front. The type is recognizable principally because of the elaborate helmet, with its raised cheek- pieces, peaked browband, and the three crests supported by a sphinx and two pegasoi. In addition, Athena is shown with the characteristic long locks hanging down on to her shoulders, thick curls falling in front of her ears and an aegis which opens at the front, adorned with a gorgoneion and snakes. Changes introduced because of the small scale and the shape of the mould include the lack of decoration both on the cheek-pieces and on and above the browband.

The small medallion is adorned with the bust of Athena Parthenos. The head of the goddess is shown in profile, while the bust is shown three-quarters to the right. Many typical features are included in this small representation. The helmet has three crests supported by a sphinx and two pegasoi, all rather small, raised cheek-pieces, animal protomai, a peaked browband, and a scale design on the neckguard. The aegis has a snake border and a scale pattern. The hair is arranged into a thick braid at the back, with</page><page sequence="234">ATHENA PARTHENOS 2 1 5 archaizing locks on the shoulders and a thick bunch of curls in front of the ears. The cluster earrings and the necklace are also seen on several replicas, though there are more often two rows of round beads, rather than one, as seen here, in addition to the pendants. The scroll motif on the dome of the helmet is seen on several copies. The spear rests on the left shoulder, and is supported by a snake from the aegis. This detail is also found on the medallion from the Arndt Collection in Munich. Most untypical is the raised shield set behind the spear on the goddess's left side. BIBLIOGRAPHY Leipen, N.

There is also a snake from the aegis twisted around the spear. Unlike many examples of the type, however, this one shows a straight lower edge to the browband, rather than a peaked one. The goddess is also shown wearing earrings and a necklace. BIBLIOGRAPHY Leipen, N. (1971) 14, no. 66. 88. CALENIAN MEDALLION Munich, Glyptothek. Calenian medallion. Terracotta.

Provenance unknown. 4th century BC. The medallions are well preserved. They are thought to come from the lid of a pyxis. Similar but not identical, the medallions are adorned with a frontal head of the Athena Parthenos type. Both include the complex helmet - though animal protomai are lacking - and the necklace with beads and pendants. They also have similar, heavy facial features. One example has an abbreviated aegis and a crouching Nike on either side of the neck. Odd features include the flamelike waves of hair on each side of the helmet, and the griffins, instead of pegasoi, acting as side crest-supports. The other example includes disc and pendant earrings.

ATHENIAN "NEW STYLE" TETRADRACHM London, British Museum. Athenian 'new style' tetradrachm. Diam. 30mm; Weight. 16.89gr. Silver. From Thessalonika. 164 BC or later. The coin is well preserved. It was found in a hoard of coins in Thessalonika. This is one of a large series of coins with the head of the Athena Parthenos type in profile to the right. These coins were first minted in Athens from some time after 196 BC, when Flamininus defeated Philip V at Kynoskephalai and proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at Corinth. They continued to be used to the time of Augustus, with minor changes but always retaining the basic form. The fact that the series continued to be minted for so long and that the type was imitated not only in places such as Macedonia and Thessaly, but further afield in Ionia, Pontus and Paphlagonia, and even Crete and S. Arabia, testifies to the newly regained prosperity of Athens during this period.704 As Jenkins says, this was in part due to the fact that from 166 BC Athens had possession of the newly constituted free port of Delos. As in earlier Athenian coins, the basic elements are the head of Athena on one side and an owl on the other, but the style is completely different. For the head of Athena, the Athena Parthenos was clearly used as a model. The helmet is easily recognizable as it is of Attic type, with offset neckguard, upturned cheek-pieces, a triple crest, with a pegasos clearly acting as one of the side crest supports, tendrils on the dome, and a peaked browband with horses' heads. An oddity of the series is that the central crest has no support. The goddess has pointed earrings, and her hair is arranged in curls in front of the ears, with longer ones falling on to the nape. A peculiarity of early examples of this coinage, but not of this particular example, is that a biga and driver are sometimes shown on the neckguard. On the reverse is an owl, standing on a horizontal amphora, within an olive wreath. There is also a small figure of Asklepios to the left of the owl. On either side of the owl are letters. A0E, for Athens, indicates the place of issue. MENED, for Mened(emos); EPIGENO, for Epigeno(s), and ALEXA, for Alex(...), this name is not clear: the first two names indicate who was in charge of organizing the year's coinage and they recur on every issue of that year. The last name indicates a more junior assistant, and this name sometimes changes during the course of the year. The letter K on the amphora signifies the month of issue, and the letters HT below the amphora perhaps indicate the source of the metal. The basic design of the reverse, with an owl on an amphora, is similar to other examples of this type of coin. But in some cases a small figure of the whole of the Athena Parthenos figure, complete with shield, spear, serpent and Nike is included next to the owl.705 BIBLIOGRAPHY Demargne, P.

It is inscribed KARPOU at the right of side B, which bears the head of Athena, profile to the right. The lead token has a standing figure reflecting the Athena Parthenos type on one side. The goddess is shown with a spear in her left hand, a shield on the ground to her left, a Nike on her right hand and what may be an owl to her right. The image is not unlike that found on certain Imperial coins, though on these the snake is usually included.707 Two other lead tokens with the Athena Parthenos type are: a.

From the Athenian Agora. Earlier 4th century BC. The token is intact but very worn. It was found in Classical levels of the N-S road running west of the Classical commercial building in the Athenian Agora, in 1994. The terracotta token is of fine, unglazed Attic clay, impressed on one side, flat on the other, and with no sign of a string hole. It is adorned with the full figure of the Athena Parthenos. The draped female figure is identifiable because she bears a small figure on her outstretched right hand, while her left hand touches the rim of an upright shield on her left side. She also wears a helmet, although this is rather indistinct, and she stands with her left leg bent at the knee. Below the right lower arm is a rearing snake. Camp interprets this as early evidence for the original position of the serpent, before it was moved to the left side of the goddess, when a pillar became necessary to support the right forearm and the Nike.

Red- figure krater by the Hephaistos Painter. 440-30 BC. The Athena Parthenos, holding her spear in her left hand and Nike on her outstretched right hand, can be seen standing between two crouching warriors, Achilles and Ajax, who are playing a board game. Athena's head is rather damaged but one can see part of the browband and one crest of the helmet. Athena wears a peplos with apoptygma, tied at the waist, and she has a short, rounded aegis, with a fringe of twisting snakes and a large gorgoneion. She looks in the direction of Nike who appears to be stepping forwards, a taenia in her hands. The pose and attributes are typical of the Parthenos type, even if the type has been somewhat simplified here, lacking as it does the complicated helmet decorations, jewellery, and snake belt as well as the shield and serpent.

Top Diam. 76cm; est. H. 74cm. Terracotta. Found in Crimea, near Baksy. 410-390 BC. Associated with the Pronomos painter. The vase is very fragmentary. All the fragments recovered in 1882 have been preserved, including the krater foot. The bell krater seems to have been used during a ceremonial funerary feast and deliberately smashed afterwards. It was found scattered in small pieces over an area about 5m2 in 1882 by N. P. Kondakov, near Baksy in a kurgan about 10km. north-east of Kerch, the ancient Greek colony of Pantikapaion, in the Crimea. It was brought to the Hermitage in the same year, but not studied in detail until B. Shefton started work on it in 1968. It was published by Shefton in 1982. The main picture of the vase is divided into two registers, of which the upper register, which shows a group of gods in a line, is well preserved. In the centre of the scene is the seated figure of Zeus, clearly of similar type to the Zeus of Olympia by Pheidias (this figure is described in the catalogue for the Zeus at Olympia). To the right of Zeus is the standing figure of Athena, bearing some of the characteristics of the Athena Parthenos. Athena has a triple-crested helmet, and while the central crest seems to rest directly on the dome (and not on a sphinx, as one would expect), the other two crests seem to emerge from the wings of some animal, which might be a horse. The raised cheek-pieces are adorned with a decoration, but what it represents is difficult to make out. Athena wears an aegis of which the basic design seems true to type, even if the details are somewhat different: it is divided in the centre front, it is covered in a scale design, it has snakes around the outer edges and a gorgoneion in the middle. From other copies, it seems likely that the aegis was of a squarer shape and that there were more snakes around the outer edge than shown here. To Athena's left stands a shield, on which she rests her left hand. Like the Parthenos shield, this one was painted on the inner side and part of the design can be made out. Around the outside is a wave pattern, and within can clearly be seen a naked male warrior with helmet and shield. His right leg is bent at the knee and the foot, which is not visible, is set at a higher level than the left foot. He looks down, presumably at his adversary below. A fighter in a very similar pose can be seen on ANM 1333 by the Pronomos painter.710 The pose, and the diagonal composition it implies, is very reminiscent of the duelling pairs of Pheidias 's Amazonomachy from the outer surface of the Parthenos shield. It is tempting to think that the Baksy krater figure preserves a fraction of the very ill-documented inner surface of the Parthenos shield, which bore a Gigantomachy. Unlike the Athena Parthenos, the Baksy krater Athena is draped in a purple cloak, she has a thin ribbon tied in a bow at her waist, and her dress has hardly any overfold. Furthermore, she rests her weight on her left leg, and her right upper arm seems to be held up and away from her body, supporting her spear which is on her right, rather than her left, side.

KARLSRUHE HYDRIA Karlsruhe, Badisches Landesmuseum, B 36 (259). Red-figure hydria. H. 50cm. Terrracotta. From Ruvo. c. 400 BC. The name-vase of the Painter of the Karlsruhe Paris. The upper register is adorned with a scene depicting the judgement of Paris and the figure of Athena, standing to the left of Paris, shows the influence of the Athena Parthenos. Athena has a complex Attic helmet with three crests, the two outer ones mounted on horse protomai. The raised cheek-pieces are adorned, possibly with Centaurs. The goddess wears a large, scaled aegis with gorgoneion. Most interesting is the fact that part of the richly decorated interior of her shield is visible. One can see the plain handle for the hand, near the outer edge of the shield as well as the arm band in the middle, which is adorned with a gorgoneion and has a floral palmette below it and a more simple, four-leaf design above it, painted on to the shield. The outer edge of the shield is adorned with a castellated design between plain lines. Within this border and in the spaces around the central arm band and palmettes, above and below the forearm, one can dimly see a multi-figure design depicting figures engaged in a battle. Five or six figures can be discerned; some are striding vigorously, one appears to be collapsing. They could perhaps form part of a Gigantomachy. Features which are unlike those of the Athena Parthenos include the position of the arms, the dress and the hairstyle. The left arm is bent and bears the shield while the right is raised to support the upright spear. The sleeve of a chiton can be seen on the right upper arm and the goddess has masses of curly hair framing her face. The position of the right arm and the spear could reflect the 'Promachos' type.

It was found in the Casa del Fauno in Pompeii. It is a table support consisting of the statue of a large sphinx, which is sitting up on its haunches, with its front legs straight and its tail curled up against its right side. The sphinx looks straight ahead with an expressionless face. The hair is arranged in a simple, wavy pattern over the crown of the head. It is parted centrally over the forehead and wavy locks are brought round the side of the head and over the ears to the back of the head. Its large, delicate wings stretch out behind it, with feather patterns adorning them in low relief. This type of sphinx is known in numerous replicas. It has been studied principally by Berger and by Hafner, who agree that it copies an original of the mid 5th century BC. Hafner identifies it as a copy of the sphinx from the top of the helmet of the Athena Parthenos which, according to Pliny, NH 36. 19, was particularly admired. Replica list: 1.

The frame, parts of the background to the right and the left, the left corner and a triangle between the two heads in relief have been restored.

There are dowel holes in the right hand of the woman on the right and the left hand of the other figure. The relief has been in the Villa Albani since before the 19th century. It is probably of Greek origin. The relief bears two figures, perhaps adapted from figures on the base of Athena Parthenos. To the right is a woman, perhaps Leto, who is shown frontally, in a belted</page><page sequence="243">224 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS peplos with overfold, and an himation, of which she holds a piece in her right hand. The dowel hole in this hand suggests that she once held a metal object too. She stands with her weight on her right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side. She measures 0.45m high. To her left is the striding figure of Artemis in an unbelted peplos and billowing mantle (measuring 0.42m high). She is shown frontally, but striding away from the other figure, towards the left. With her right hand she was reaching for an arrow in the quiver on her back (visible above her right shoulder). The right leg steps forward, appearing in the peplos opening, while the other leg is set back and shown modelled through the drapery. There is much movement in this figure. The scene seems to depict Artemis being sent by her mother to take vengeance on Tityos, or perhaps Niobe. The relief has sometimes been thought to be a metope from the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous, but neither the proposed date nor the size of the relief are suitable for this temple.711 Comparison of the figure of Artemis with the running figure of the Parthenon west gable has suggested to Brommer a Pheidian prototype. And the pose of the figure of Leto may be compared with that of the peplos figure on the left of the base of the Pergamene Athena, which copies the base of the Athena Parthenos. Leto's pose is very similar to that of this figure, but it has been reversed. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951)215. Bol, P. C., ed (1992) 102-05, no. 287, pls. 71-3. Brommer, F. (1984) 286, pl. 32.2.

L. lower edge 0.35; L. upright edge 0.41m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 1st century BC. The roughly triangular fragment preserves its rim. The surface is in quite good condition, though all the heads of the figures in relief, as well as other details, are badly damaged. It is thought to be from Athens, of neo- Attic workmanship. The fragment comes from a copy in reduced scale of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. This piece is of great importance as it preserves most of the upper left quadrant of the shield, which is otherwise virtually unknown. In the bottom right corner are remains of the central gorgoneion. In addition, one can see three complete figures, all Amazons, and traces of three others. The three Amazons wear thin tunics, tied at the waist and on the left shoulder, leaving the right breast uncovered. They also have knee-high boots, with down- turned tops and they carry shields on the left arm. Some of them at least may have worn a 711 Langlotz (1937) 225f.</page><page sequence="244">ATHENA PARTHENOS 225 helmet. They come from the stone-thrower group, which probably had a total of six figures and was the largest group on the shield. It is perhaps because of the size of the group and the lack of fighting pairs in it (for it consisted of five Amazons and only one Greek) that the group was not copied in the Piraeus reliefs. On the left hand side is the Amazon seated in frontal view, who raises her shield above her head to protect herself from attack. Next to her is an Amazon running downhill. She too raises her shield in defence, probably against the Greek warrior about to hurl a rock, who is known from the top of the Lenormant shield. Then there is an Amazon attacking uphill towards the right. Her right arm is lowered and its hand probably held a dagger. The legs of this Amazon are preserved on the far left of the Strangford shield, in a much lower position than shown on the Vatican shield. A sketchy and not very accurate version of the Amazon running downhill is preserved on the top left of the Lenormant shield. Above the Amazon attacking uphill are traces of another figure, but it is not clear which one. The other three figures in the group of six are the seated Amazon in back view, known from the Patras and Strangford shields, the stone-thrower, mentioned above, and the Amazon with head down. At the bottom of the fragment are the remains of two other figures. These are the young Greek with a round shield and the Amazon attacking him with an axe. Their presence on this fragment is very useful in confirming the position of this group in the centre of the left side of the shield. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) 11 Iff., pl. 65, fig. 193.

AGORA SHIELD FRAGMENT (Fig. 6.37) Athens, Agora Museum, T 3577. Shield relief. Diam. c. 0. 15m. Terracotta. Provenance unknown. 3rd century AD. Apart from some of the lower edge, this piece is broken all round. The figures appear sketchy and badly rubbed. The fragment was excavated in 1958. The fragment comes from a miniature replica of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, showing the Amazonomachy of the outer surface. The figures were moulded in low relief. Parts of five figures remain. On the right, and clearly recognizable, is the hair-pulling group, known from several Piraeus reliefs as well as other copies. Above these figures can just be seen the ends of a pair of feet, which must belong to the wounded Greek of the helper group, which is set in the same relative position on the Patras shield. The other two figures come from the pilos- wearer group and are positioned at the bottom of the shield. The figure of the dead Greek lying on his cloak is almost completely preserved and above him can be seen a leg striding to the right. This would have belonged to the Amazon being attacked by the pilos-wearer, as is clear from the Patras shield. To the left of the dead Greek is a lunate shield. This fragment is important as its close accordance with the Patras shield strengthens the view that the Patras shield faithfully preserves the composition of the original.</page><page sequence="245">226 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS BIBLIOGRAPHY Grandjouan, C.

From Rome, Esquiline, 1874. AD 150-200. The fragment is unrestored and broken all round. Parts in higher relief, especially the heads, are very damaged. It was found in 1874, near the Via Arriosto, with part of the statue to which it belonged, a torso 0.62m high. It was formerly in the Conservatori, Gallery 44. The fragment comes from a reduced scale copy of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, preserving the lower left quadrant. In the upper right corner can be seen the outer part of the round, central gorgoneion, consisting of a ring of entwined snakes. To the left of this is the lower half of a figure striding to the left in a short chiton. As can be seen from the Vatican fragment, this is the lower half of the Amazon wielding an axe, who was set in the central group of the left half of the shield. Directly below her is a Greek wielding an axe in the direction of a figure on the outer edge of the shield, who has one arm bent round so that the hand touches her back. According to Meyer, this is a confused version of the spear group, which can be restored from the Munich relief.712 The Amazon, who can be seen on the Munich relief, on a sarcophagus fragment from Aphrodisias (inv. 75-17) as well as on the bottom right side of the Strangford shield, should be sinking to the ground with her knees bent, as a result of the wound inflicted to her neck by the Greek warrior behind her. The Munich relief shows the Greek wearing a chlamys, and a similar figure on the Strangford shield also wears a chlamys, so the scabbard shown on his left side in this relief is probably a copyist's alteration. The arm movements of the Greek, both here and on the Strangford shield, are appropriate for someone swinging an axe, but, interestingly, on the Munich relief, although he is swinging an axe there too, the arm positions are slightly different and they are much more appropriate for someone holding a spear. Meyer deduces from this, and from the position of the Amazon - as well as from the fact that the figure just above the Greek on the Parthenos shield held an axe - that in the original group this Greek was probably shown killing his victim with a spear. The last group preserved on this fragment is the so-called 'Antiope' group, which shows an Amazon steadying herself, presumably on some rocks, while a Greek stoops down behind her, touching her back. The stationary pose of the Amazon suggests that she is not trying to escape from the Greek and that, on the contrary, he is helping her, perhaps by pulling a weapon out of her back. The Greek is sometimes identified as Theseus. A shadowy reflection of this group can be seen on the lower left part of the Lenormant shield. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Harrison, E. B.

H. 0.426; W. 0.457; Diam. 0.50m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. AD 200-250. About two-thirds of the disc is preserved. The missing part is on the upper left side. The surface is in quite good condition. The relief was obtained by Viscount Strangford in Athens in the first half of the 19th century. The relief is a small version of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, showing much of the Amazonomachy relief on its outer face as well as traces of the Gigantomachy painted on the inner surface. On the interior the faint traces of two figures from the Gigantomachy are to be identified as giants by the fact that each one is holding a rock. The figure on the left has a beard and he leans forward slightly, straining his muscles in an effort to carry a great boulder, which he has lifted to waist level. He is seen in three-quarter view to the right. Near him kneels a second giant, and he is hurling a rock with his right hand. Both figures appear to be wearing animal skins. On the exterior is the Amazonomachy, shown in relief, and with no background included. In the centre is the gorgon' s head, which is framed by two snakes, knotted above and below her head. She has an ugly face, with wide cheeks, a flat nose, centrally parted hair, which is arranged in waves, and a tongue which protrudes from her mouth. Around her can be seen twelve complete figures and six fragmentary ones. Their arrangement is crowded and there is some overlapping, which probably does not reflect the original. As on the Patras, Agora and Lenormant shields, the hair-pulling group is shown in the lower right quadrant. Above this can be seen the group of three: a Greek behind his shield being attacked by two Amazons with spears. Nevertheless, this representation deviates from what can be seen on the Patras shield and the Piraeus relief (inv. 2123): the upper Amazon should be kneeling and she probably wore a panther skin instead of holding a shield, while the lower one should be seen from back view and she should be aiming a spear, not holding an axe. The Greek helper group, which should fit above the hair-pulling group and below the group of three, has been omitted, presumably for lack of space. Above the group of three can be seen part of the Amazon seated in back view, from the stone-thrower group, which is now almost entirely missing, and some of the 'Kapaneus' group. The lower leg of 'Kapaneus' can just be made out, while below it is preserved the whole of the Amazon attacking uphill. She, however, is facing downwards instead of looking up in the direction of her adversary, as she appears in the Piraeus relief, inv. 2206. The composition is further confused by the presence of the Amazon with a spear to the right of the central gorgoneion. This figure is the adversary of the Greek archer, and she appears to have slipped down a little too far, thus interfering with the group of three. This representation compares unfavourably with that on the Patras shield, where the Amazon with the spear is still rather low perhaps but definitely above the Greek from the group of three. Turning to the lower left side of the shield and the very bottom, the representation is even more confused, and it seems to reflect the literary tradition concerning the shield as much as anything else. Meyer's restoration of the left side of the original shield, with the help of the Munich relief, and the Vatican and Conservatori</page><page sequence="247">228 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS fragments, shows that the Amazon with her head down must have been set much higher up the shield than she is shown on the Strangford shield. There is also no evidence, apart from the Lenormant shield, that the figure was shown hanging down vertically, as she is shown here. The Amazon shown seated on the ground and clutching an axe, on the left side where the shield breaks off, is surely the Amazon seated in front view from the upper left quadrant of the shield, as she appears on the Vatican fragment. On the Strangford shield she has been moved too far in and set rather lower down, and her arm positions have been altered. Then there is the kneeling Amazon at the bottom of the shield, paired with a Greek swinging an axe. This Amazon may be intended to be a version of 'Antiope', as seen on the Conservatori shield, but it is not clear, as the arm and leg positions are quite different. The remaining four figures reflect well documented shield figures, but the way they have been arranged confirms the view that this copy is highly unreliable. On the far left is the lower half of a figure stepping up towards the right. Although placed too low on the shield and without his partner, this figure surely reflects the Greek from the axe group, who was set in the centre of the left side of the Parthenos shield. Beneath the gorgoneion is a man with his arms above his head in a group with a warrior with his right arm in front of his face treading on a dead Amazon. The Amazon is a horizontal version of the victim of the Munich Greek, whom Meyer probably rightly restores to the lower left quadrant of the Parthenos shield.713 The warrior treading on her is an adaptation of the Amazon from the pilos-wearer group, known from the Patras shield as well as a relief formerly in Salamis.714 The man wielding an axe seems to be a conflation of two separate figures: the arm positions reflect the stone-thrower, who is set at the top of the Lenormant shield, while the chlamys seems to have been borrowed from the Munich Greek type, who would have featured somewhat to the left of and above the figure on the Strangford shield. Plutarch {Per. 31, 3-4) says that two figures on the shield were thought to be portraits of Pheidias and Perikles. Pheidias was supposed to be shown as a bald old man hurling a stone, while Perikles was discreetly hidden because he held a spear in front of his face. It seems probable that the 'Pheidias' figure is to be indentified with the stone-thrower at the top of the shield, while the 'Perikles' figure is to be identifed with the pilos-wearer at the bottom of the shield. Thus it seems that the Strangford copyist identifed the wrong figure as 'Perikles' and, moreover, he moved 'Pheidias' to place him in the same group as 'Perikles'. The apparent baldness of the man wielding an axe may be due to no more than an unfortunate chip in the surface of the marble. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arafat, K. (1986) 1-6. Becatti, G. (1951) 11 Iff., pl. 64.

'Lenormant' shield. H. 0.15m. Pentelic marble. Found at Athens, west of Pnyx, 1859. Antonine. The relief is sketchy and not very well preserved, especially on the right side. The statuette with this shield was dentified as a copy of the Athena Parthenos by Lenormant. This miniature version of the shield of the Athena Parthenos shows in a sketchy and abbreviated form the Amazonomachy relief on its outer face. No background details can be seen. In the centre, and with no snakes surrounding, is the head of the Gorgon, with a wide face framed with thick masses of hair. On the lower right side, as on the Patras, Agora and Strangford shields, is the well known hair-pulling group. At the bottom is the pilos-wearer and beneath him the horizontal figure of the dead Greek. The third member of this group, the Amazon striding to the right, has been omitted, presumably for lack of space. On the lower left side is the 'Antiope' group, which can be seen more clearly on the Conservatori fragment. Harrison is of the opinion that this group is an Amazon helper group, to match the Greek helper group on the lower right side of the shield, but there seems to be little evidence to support this view.715 At the top and in the upper left quadrant are three figures from the stone-thrower group: the Amazon fighting uphill, the stone-thrower and the Amazon with her head down. The other three members of this group were two seated Amazons, one seen from back view (see the top of the Strangford and Patras shields) and one seen from front view (see the Vatican fragment), and an Amazon running downhill (also preserved on the Vatican shield). The stone-thrower is not preserved on any other copy, but he is described by Plutarch {Per. 31, 3) as being old and bald and commonly identified as Pheidias. Whether he is shown as old and bald on the Lenormant copy is impossible to tell, given the worn condition of this piece. But he is clearly wearing a short tunic. This has sometimes been identified as the exomis typically worn by artisans, but whether this is correct is not clear.716 Although most of the other Greeks are represented as naked, apart from perhaps a helmet or chlamys or boots, at least two other Greeks wore short tunics: the so-called 'Perikles' at the bottom of the shield and the young Greek in the axe group. The most damaged part of the shield and the most difficult to read is the upper right quadrant, where three more figures can be made out, but exactly which ones they are is not easy to see. Groups which have been omitted completely from this miniature representation include the axe group and the spear group, from the middle and lower left part of the shield. On the right side none of the following groups can be recognized: the helper group, the group of three, the archer group and the Kapaneus group. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

Diam. 0.45m. Pentelic marble. From Patras. Mid 2nd century AD. The object has been put together from two fragments. Most of the right half of the shield survives, apart from some of the outer edge on the lower right side. A very small part of the left half, at the bottom and in the central part with gorgoneion, also survives. The surface is in quite good condition. The statue, with the lower part of the shield, was found in Patras in 1896. The larger fragment of the shield was found in 1937, also in Patras. This fragmentary copy in reduced scale of the shield of the Athena Parthenos shows the Amazonomachy of the outer surface in relief. It is made in one block with a copy of the statue itself. The figures in relief are about one-tenth the size of the original figures. This piece is of great importance as it preserves many of the figures of the composition, and comparison with the other copies shows that it was probably one of the more faithful copies, with regard to figure pose and composition. There is no indication of a background on this copy, probably because of the small scale, and many details such as the weapons are missing too. These elements would probably have been painted on. The central gorgoneion clearly shows a wide-faced Gorgon, with centrally parted, wavy hair and small wings protruding from either side of the top of the head. Her tongue sticks out. The head is surrounded, at some distance, by a crown of intertwined snakes. Of the Amazonomachy, seven groups are represented, although two of them are very fragmentary, and three from the lower left quadrant are completely lost. At the top of the fragment, on the outer part of the shield, can be seen the 'Kapaneus' group, of which only the upper half of 'Kapaneus' is missing. Below the Amazon from this group is the Amazon from the archer group, attacking uphill. The lower left leg of her adversary can just be seen at the break on the upper left side of the fragment. Between the two figures lies a lunate shield. Of the group which occupied the top of the shield and the upper left quadrant, all that remains is the lower part of the Amazon seated in back view, positioned just above the gorgoneion. The central part of the right half of the shield is occupied by two groups: the group of three and, below this, the helper group. The group of three is not very well documented, so this copy is important as it shows well the strong diagonal lines and the depth of this group composition. The upper Amazon is shown wearing an animal skin. The Greek has a cloak over his left thigh, just as he is shown in Piraeus relief, inv. 2012+2022. The lower Amazon is clearly shown from back view, and not from front view, as she appears on the Strangford version. In the lower left quadrant is the hair-pulling group, but here the figures are a little too far apart, just as they appear on Piraeus relief, inv. 21 15, so that the Greek's hand is some distance from the Amazon's head. It seems probable that the closer position of the Agora, Lenormant and Strangford groups, which can also be seen on the Villa Faustina copy, is more faithful to the original. At the bottom of the shield is the most</page><page sequence="250">ATHENA PARTHENOS 231 complete copy of the pilos-wearer group, showing the upper part of the pilos-wearer with his shield, the Amazon striding before him and preparing to strike him with her sword, and the dead Greek lying on the ground at their feet. The Agora fragment preserves part of this group, but it breaks off in the middle of it, unfortunately. The only other reduced copies to show the group are the Lenormant and Strangford shields, both of which are inaccurate. The Lenormant shield omits the figure of the Amazon, while the Strangford shield creates a completely new group, with four figures adapted from original shield figures. The groups which are completely lost on the Patras shield are the axe group (known from the Conservatori and Vatican fragments), the spear group (known from the Munich relief), and the so-called 'Antiope' group (also known from the Conservatori fragment).

The two joining fragments come from a sarcophagus. The smaller piece (75-104) is very fresh and unweathered, though it is broken all round. It preserves part of the torso of a youth, as can be seen from the remains of the navel, the right side of the abdomen and some of the inguinal line. The larger piece, which is very weathered, consists of a little over half the length of the front of a sarcophagus from the lower left corner. In addition to the front surface, this fragment preserves part of the left side - which was also decorated - and parts of the resting surface and the floor of the box. The fragments show the remains of a relief depicting a dead Greek, but he lacks parts of the left foot and left knee, part of the right thigh, some of the torso, the face, the right arm and shoulder and part of the hand. These fragments belong with one other fragment from the same side of this sarcophagus, Harrison no. lc (inv. 75-17), which comes from the lower right corner and which shows a wounded Amazon, set horizontally. A number of other fragments from the same sarcophagus have been found, and they are listed below. The estimated size of the sarcophagus is L. c.2.65m by W. at least lm, perhaps as much as 1.35m by H. c. 1.18m. The figure of a dead Greek, preserved on this sarcophagus, was copied from the shield of the Athena Parthenos. In scale, the figure agrees with that of figures on the Piraeus relief copies, which are thought to equal those of the original figures. On a rise of rocky ground</page><page sequence="251">232 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS lies a dead youth, who is completely naked. His pose is characterized by the head, which is thrown back at a sharp angle, the lower legs which hang down so that the left crosses the right, and the arm positions: while the left arm is bent into a strong V-shape with the hand resting on the rock by the man's left side, the right arm is flung over his head with the hand hanging down. This figure can be recognized as coming from the bottom of the Parthenos shield composition, where he was placed beneath the pilos-wearer and his Amazon adversary. His position and pose are confirmed by the Patras and Lenormant copies, as well as by the terracotta shield from the Agora. On the Patras shield the figure has a cloak beneath him. There are traces of two other figures on the larger fragment. The booted toe of a walking figure can be seen 0.34m to the right of the dead Greek. It is the following foot of someone striding to the right. On the surviving part of the left end there are the traces of another booted foot, which Harrison thinks may be the trailing foot of a seated Amazon.717 These fragments are thought to belong to the early Antonine period, partly because of the simple box shape of the sarcophagus but also because of the close resemblance between these carvings and the Piraeus reliefs, in the manner of sculpting, in the dimensions of the figures and in the oblique angle from which they are shown. It suggests that the Aphrodisian copies were made from plaster casts. BIBLIOGRAPHY Harrison, E. B. (1981) 284, pl. 46, figs. 1 and 2. 11 IB.

Battered and weathered, broken above, to the left and behind, the piece preserves the lower surface, part of the right end, and some of the floor. The relief figure has a badly damaged face, lower left arm and feet, parts of which are missing. This fragment joins Harrison no. la (inv. 75-78) to complete the length of the front side of a sarcophagus, adorned with reliefs copied from the shield of Athena Parthenos. The similarities with the Piraeus reliefs in manner of carving, angle of view and figure dimension strongly suggest that the copies were made indirectly using plaster casts of the Piraeus reliefs. In the right lower corner is the figure of an Amazon, set horizontally with the remains of a striding left leg above. The left leg wore a boot with a down-turned top. The other foot of this same figure is probably preserved in Harrison catalogue no. 2, though the two parts do not join. Harrison indentifies the striding figure as Perikles, but it is more probably an Amazon standing her ground in front of the so-called pilos-wearer (who was surely the figure popularly identified as Perikles), in the group set at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. The Amazon has been recognized by Meyer as belonging to the spear group of the upper part of the lower left quadrant of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, in which group the figure was set vertically. The copyist has here shown her as another reclining figure, like 717 Harrison (1981) 285, pl. 46.5.</page><page sequence="252">ATHENA PARTHENOS 233 the dead Greek at the left end of the same side of this sarcophagus, but in the original she was drooping and wounded in the neck, but not yet fallen. A similar reclining figure appears at the bottom of the Strangford shield. Meyer sees this figure, set horizontally, as a doublet of the dead Greek and as a variant of the type known from the Munich relief. Harrison, however, includes it in her reconstruction, so that there are two dead figures lying at the bottom of her reconstructed shield.718 No such figure appears on the Patras, Lenormant or Agora shields.

On the proper right side, part of the background is preserved. This fragment comes from the same sarcophagus as the preceding pieces. It preserves in relief a right lower leg from knee to ankle. The leg is shown almost completely from the front. It is covered in a high boot with a down-turned top and crossing thongs knotted at the top. It is thought to belong to the same figure as the leg preserved in fragment lc, and, therefore, to come from the Amazon and not a Greek, identified as Perikles, as Harrison says719, standing her ground before the so-called pilos-wearer. This group was placed at the bottom of the Parthenos shield Amazonomachy. The figure is known from a relief fragment formerly in Salamis and now in Piraeus, as well as another fragment in Piraeus (inv. 2003). The sarcophagus fragment shows the same sort of boot, except that here the furry lining of the boot is not plastically rendered along the top edge, as it is represented by the Piraeus sculptor.

This figure is well known not only from the Piraeus reliefs (inv. 2115 and 2116 etc.) - to which it is extremely similar - but also from the Patras, Agora, Lenormant and Strangford shields. In front of this figure one can also see a double-headed axe and a corner of an Amazonian pelta with a duck head at the tip. The shape and position of the axe are different on the Piraeus reliefs and the Aphrodisias sarcophagus. The Piraeus reliefs never show Amazon shields with bird heads. BIBLIOGRAPHY Harrison, E. B.

Aphrodisian marble. Found at Aphrodisias, South Wall debris, 24/7/1975. Around AD 117-38. This piece is composed of two joining fragments. The surface is in good condition. The back is preserved. The Greek archer has lost the upper part of his head, both arms, the left leg and the front of the right foot. There is also some damage to his chlamys and right calf. Of the Amazon, only the head is preserved with helmet, though the back of the crest, as well as the head and part of the wing of the griffin on the dome of the helmet, are missing. These two fragments come from the same sarcophagus as the preceding pieces. Two figures can be recognized here: the Greek archer, from the upper right quadrant of the Parthenos shield, and the seated Amazon with head in profile to left, both figures known from several other copies. The Amazon formed part of the 'stone-thrower' group which occupied the top and the upper part of the left quadrant of the shield. The details of the sandal and sock of the Greek are exactly the same as on the Piraeus reliefs of this figure, inv. 2117 etc. and inv. 2114 etc.720 The Amazon too closely resembles her counterpart on a Piraeus relief, inv. 21 12. 721 One may note, however, two additions made by the Aphrodisias copyist: there is a crest-holder on the helmet and a twisting wisp of hair in front of the left ear. While the griffin's body follows the outline of that on the Piraeus relief, the griffin's head was cut free. BIBLIOGRAPHY Harrison, E. B. (1981) 85, 286, no. 3, pl. 49, fig. 12.

The nose and helmet crest are broken and there is damage to the left eyebrow. The junction of the figure to the background is preserved along the figure's right side. The fragment, which comes from the same sarcophagus as the preceding pieces, preserves the upper face and the front of the head of an Amazon wearing a helmet with a crest.

It comes from the same sarcophagus as the preceding pieces. Against a rocky ground can be seen a right big toe, in profile to left. The toe seems to be pressing against a rocky mound and the foot rises sharply behind the toe. It might belong to the Greek helping his wounded comrade, known from the Lateran relief.

It comes from the same sarcophagus as the preceding pieces. It preserves an upper right arm from a figure wearing a short-sleeved chiton of thick fabric. The back of the arm is carefully worked and fully modelled, unlike the front, suggesting that it was intended to be seen from the back. It is not clear which figure it came from, but Harrison suggests the seated Amazon with head in profile to left. BIBLIOGRAPHY Harrison, E. B.

Sarcophagus 2, relief fragment. H. 0.21m; W. 0.27m; D. 0.18m. Aphrodisian marble. Found at Aphrodisias, in the east Aula Termale of the Theatre Baths, 12/9/1974. Around AD 117-38. The rough-picked back is preserved, but otherwise the piece is broken all round. It is battered and weathered. There is a groove, 0.04m deep, at the top. It was on this that the lid of the sarcophagus would have rested. The relief figure on this fragment is rather chipped and damaged, and the nose is lost. The fragment was found at some distance from the other sarcophagus fragments. For this reason Harrison suspects that the fragment belongs to another sarcophagus. The fragment shows the head and left shoulder of a bearded warrior. The head is depicted in profile to the right, while the torso is turned further towards the front. He wears a pilos on his head and a short-sleeved chiton, and he holds a round shield, part of the rim of which is also preserved. The figure can be recognized as the so-called pilos-wearer of the group set at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, a figure who was shown advancing to the right, towards an Amazon, with a dead Greek lying on the ground a little lower down. This figure is known from a number of fragmentary copies in Piraeus, and he also appears on the Lenormant and Patras shields. One may note that, with regard to the chiton folds and the position of the shield, this piece is very close to copies from Piraeus, but the Aphrodisian copyist has added several more exuberant details: a crest and crest holder embellish the pilos, while the hair and beard have been given extra curls. The figure also appears to tilt back a little in comparison with the Piraeus figures. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Harrison, E. B. (1981) 85, 288, no. 8, pl. 51, figs. 17-8. 113.

The relief is in good condition, though it has been put together from several fragments. Much of the border is missing, as well as the left hand and part of the left foot of the Amazon, the lower right arm and lower right leg of the Greek, and the upper part of the Amazon's shield. There is also some damage to the shield rim, the Amazon's chiton, and the right knee and left calf of the Greek. This is one of a group of Neo- Attic reliefs discovered in the winter of 1930-1931 during dredging operations in Piraeus harbour. Traces of burning on some of the fragments suggest that fire caused the ship in which the reliefs were being transported to sink in harbour. It is probable that they were being shipped to Rome. The relief plaque shows a Greek, to the left, pulling an Amazon by the hair with his left hand. This group, which is sometimes referred to as the 'death-leap' group, is known from several other copies, in Piraeus as well as on the Patras, Strangford, Lenormant and Agora shield copies. It is thought to have occupied part of the lower right quadrant of the shield of Athena Parthenos. The Greek, who is smaller than the Amazon, wears only a chlamys. He steps up on to a rock with his left foot. His torso is shown three-quarters to the right, while his head is shown in profile to the right. He probably held a short sword in his lowered right hand. He stretches out his left arm and clutches at the Amazon's hair. The</page><page sequence="256">ATHENA PARTHENOS 237 Amazon's body is arched away from the Greek. She is already wounded and about to fall. Her head is turned upwards. She holds a shield on her left arm and with her right hand she clutches the Greek's wrist in a vain attempt to free herself. Apart from the rocky mounds beneath the figures' feet, there is no background in this relief. This stands in contrast to Piraeus inv. 2115, in which an architectural background is included in low relief. The surface of the relief falls away especially on the right side, behind the lower part of the Amazon. The strong similarities between identical figures from different reliefs suggests that the copies are close to the original in size and iconography. But it also seems to be the case that, in order to suit the location planned for the relief plaques, the copyists slightly altered the angle from which the figures are seen, as well as introducing other changes. Like the other Piraeus reliefs this relief is best seen from the left. This is particularly noticeable if one looks at the left leg of the Amazon from the right side, for example, from which perspective it looks very unconvincing. From the evidence of the Villa Faustina fragment and the Agora, Lenormant and Strangford reduced copies, it also seems probable that the Greek's left hand was placed closer to the Amazon's head than it appears either here or on Piraeus inv. 2115.

Missing: lower right arm, right foot, left hand of the Greek, and part of the axe and part of the right calf of the Amazon. There is also damage to the torso, legs and face of the Greek, and to the face, right breast, torso, chiton, upper shield rim, and right lower arm of the Amazon.

It is thought to have occupied part of the lower right quadrant of the shield of Athena Parthenos. The scale of the figures is the same as that of other Piraeus relief figures. The design is very similar to Stefanidou-Tiveriou 's catalogue number 1, except that the Greek's left hand does not reach the Amazon's hair.

Date uncertain. The fragment is broken all round and has a damaged surface. The face of the Amazon is very worn. The relief is now missing, and its whereabouts are unknown. It has perhaps been stolen. The fragment is part of a relief plaque that showed the hair-pulling motif from the lower right quadrant of the shield of Athena Parthenos. This fragment preserves the torso and head of the Amazon, as well as part of the right hand of the Amazon as it clutches the left hand of the Greek. The detail of the thick lock of hair falling forward on to the left breast is very similar to the Piraeus copies of this figure, but on the Villa Faustina relief the position of the hands is much closer to the Amazon's head. This probably reflects the original pose better than the Piraeus reliefs, where the figure of the Greek is set further to the left. On the Piraeus reliefs this displacement towards the left may be explained by the fact that the reliefs were made with the intention that the best view was from the left, from which angle the two figures would appear closer together. But if one looks at the reduced- scale copies of the shield then it is interesting to see that the Agora, Lenormant and Strangford shields, though not the Patras shield, all show the two figures close together with the joining hands very near the head of the Amazon. The Greek catches hold of the Amazon by the hair and then stabs her in the back. The subsequent moment is captured in the relief. BIBLIOGRAPHY Floren, J. (1978) 36ff., pl. 9. 1.

This piece is mended from three fragments. It preserves the back of the slab, but otherwise it is broken all round. All the surfaces are weathered from modern exposure. The relief was probably used in the late Roman fortification. It perhaps comes from a frieze of which other fragments have been found in the Kerameikos. This piece is part of a relief plaque that showed the Greek helper group, copied from the upper part of the lower right quadrant of the shield of Athena Parthenos. This fragment shows the lower torso and upper left leg of the rescuing Greek, part of his cloak and his left hand. One can also see most of the torso of his wounded comrade, which slumps forward, and part of his left arm. The relief is very high and only the front face of the stone is completely finished. This suggests that the original was in lower relief than the copy. It also suggests that this fragment was used in an architectural context. One may note the strong forms of the chlamys of the Greek helper. The vertical fall of the cloth accords with the remains of the chlamys as seen on the Piraeus copy, inv. 2018. It is quite unlike the Lateran version of this part, which shows the chlamys swept away to the left. On the Patras copy, this part is missing. The outlining of the drapery with the running drill is typical of Roman workmanship of this era. BIBLIOGRAPHY Stefanidou-T i veriou, Th. (1979) 63, 79, 80, 82, 115, 170, 171, pl. 44a. Harrison, E.

Perhaps a little fragment of the frame of this plaque is preserved in Piraeus inv. 2020, a piece made from similar marble.722 The Greek is known from the Patras and Strangford shield copies. Part of his shield and one of his Amazon adversaries can also be seen on Piraeus inv. 2 123. 723 The adversaries of this Greek were two Amazons with spears, positioned to the Greek's right, one of them a little higher than him, the other well above him. He is naked apart from the raised helmet on his head and the cloak draped over his upper thigh, and he carries a round shield. His left foot is raised, probably on a rock. The tense moment as he awaits the Amazon attack, watching over the top of the shield, is well reflected in his taut muscles and slightly open mouth. 722 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) no. 28, pl. 40b. 723 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) no. 29.</page><page sequence="261">242 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS BIBLIOGRAPHY Stefanidou-Tiveriou, Th.

From Piraeus harbour. AD 117-138. The relief is badly eroded by water, so that none of the surface is intact. A little part of the frame remains, but otherwise the piece is broken all round. This is part of a relief plaque that showed an Amazon, mostly seen from back view, about to attack a Greek crouching behind his shield. This is a copy of part of the group of three, two Amazons with spears attacking a Greek, which was placed in the central part of the right half of the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos. The group can be seen clearly on the Patras copy, where the arm movements of the Amazons firmly suggest that both of them held spears. On the Piraeus copy all that remains is part of the shield on the left side and the outline of the lower Amazon on the right side. The Amazon is kneeling on her right knee, and sitting on the right foot, while her left leg is stretched out on the left side, with the foot set at a lower level. Her right arm was raised and her left arm stretches down towards the left in order to give her balance. Both these movements would accord well with her holding a spear, even though there are no signs of it on this fragment. In the original composition it seems likely that she would have been placed at a greater distance from her opponent. In the Strangford shield version of this figure, not only has she been turned round to appear from front view, but in addition the arm movements have not been understood, as is clear from the fact that an axe has been substituted for the long spear.

Part of the top of the panel and frame survive, but otherwise the piece is broken all round. There is much water erosion to the figure of the Greek, so the details of his hair and face are virtually lost. The drapery on his left shoulder, however, is clearly visible still. This is part of a relief plaque that showed the so-called 'Kapaneus' group, copied from the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos, where it was set at the top of the shield on the right side. The figures of this group, consisting of the wounded Greek and an Amazon striding uphill towards him, are quite well documented. Their position and poses are established by the Patras shield. There are several good copies of the Greek. In this relief one can see the upper part of this bearded warrior, the drapery hanging down from his left shoulder, the right arm raised and bent round in the characteristic action of trying to reach the wound, and perhaps the weapon, in his neck.

Restorations include the rocky ground, all of the right quarter of the relief and some parts of the figure in relief, in particular the left lower leg and foot, the nose, and the toes of the right foot. There is some damage to the rim of the shield. Small pieces are missing from the hair on the forehead, the lips, the drapery and the private parts.

In agreement with the Chicago version, the mantle falls over the left thigh, unlike the more careless Boston copy. This copy is useful in that it preserves many of the details of the hair. Thick curls form the beard, while the hair on the head is rendered in low relief waves and bound by a fillet. This accords well with the Chicago piece. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) pl. 43a.

Missing parts include the right elbow and part of the arm, the fingers of the left hand and parts of the shield rim. The scale and style of this piece are similar to the Piraeus copies, suggesting that the piece may have come from the same workshop. The piece was presented to Chicago in 1928 by Jacob Hirsch as the gift of Alfred E. Hamill, 1928.257. It was supposedly found in Salamis before 1925. The relief preserves a copy of the so-called 'Kapaneus' figure from the top right side of the shield of the Athena Parthenos.

Slight differences from the Albani copy include the following features: the figure is set closer to the frame on the left side, the shield is somewhat larger and the hand strap does not touch the edge of the shield rim but is set within it, the piece of cloth falling in front of the shoulder falls at a slight angle away from the body.

The relief is well preserved in parts, but water has eroded the Amazon's right leg and arm, the middle part of her trunk, and the rock foot support. Her hands and weapon are missing. There is also damage to the frame. This is part of a relief plaque that showed the so-called 'Kapaneus' group, copied from the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos, where it was set at the top of the shield on the right side. This fragment preserves the right part of the plaque, with the figure of an Amazon drawing her sword as she steps up with her right foot. The Amazon is moving towards the left and her head is shown inclined upwards and in profile to the left, while her torso is shown frontally. She wears a short belted chiton, with overfold, knee- high boots with crossing thongs over the lower leg, down-turned tops and a fur lining. On her head she wears an Attic helmet with a large crest and a snake motif in relief on the dome. Her weapon is now missing but the arm movements suggest that she was drawing a short sword. Her target was the wounded Greek, kneeling on one knee, the so-called 'Kapaneus'. Her position and pose are confirmed by the Patras copy. On the Strangford shield, however, the grouping with 'Kapaneus' is not respected, for the figure is made to look down to the right rather than up towards the left. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

From Piraeus harbour. AD 117-138. The panel was put together from three fragments, but there are pieces still missing. The figures are quite well preserved, though the Greek lacks part of his left arm and the Amazon lacks her left foot and much of her right leg. The relief plaque shows the archer group, copied from the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos, where it occupied the top of the shield on the right side. The Greek archer, wearing tunic, chlamys and sandals, is seen looking down towards his adversary, who is approaching him from the right with spear in hand. He steps up on a rock with his right leg, while his left leg is set lower down. His right arm is raised and completely bent, in the action of one drawing a bow, though the bow and arrow he must originally have held are not shown at all. The left arm is held down and slightly away from the body. The Amazon adversary seems to be clutching his left hand, as her arm is outstretched towards the Greek, while the right is extended behind her, holding the spear. It is probable that the copyist has drawn the figures closer together than they would have appeared on the original shield, because of the confínes of the space available. On the original one would expect the Amazon to have been aiming her spear from some distance. There would have been no hand contact. Compare the relevant figures on the Patras shield, which are set quite far apart. The Amazon wears a belted tunic and an Attic helmet with scroll motifs in relief and a large crest. The depiction of the Amazon's arms and hands is clumsy. The Greek's head, with sulky, down-turned lips, is in the manner of certain Parthenon frieze heads. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

The relief has been put together from several fragments, but much of it is still missing. Parts of the relief decoration are in fairly good condition, but some of the fragments arc very damaged and worn. Of the Greek, the head and the upper torso survive, as well as part of the upper legs with drapery. Of the Amazon, the upper body and head survive, though the face is very damaged. Much of the legs are missing, as well as the right hand and most of the shield. These fragments of a relief plaque show the archer group, copied from the shield Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos, where it occupied the top of the shield on the right side. A Greek archer, on the left side, and seen from the front, but with his head in profile to the right, prepares to fire at an Amazon, who advances up towards him and prepares to throw her spear at him. The Amazon is seen primarily from the back, but with her head in profile to the left. The poses and the details of dress and drapery are very similar to those of Piraeus archer group 1 (inv. 2117+2080+2094), though in this case a shield has been added to the accoutrements of the Amazon. She holds it in her left hand.</page><page sequence="266">ATHENA PARTHENOS 247 The rectangular format of the Piraeus plaque, which demands that figures of this size should be quite close together and set at more or less the same level, detracts from the original design, which used differences of level and diagonal poses to great advantage.

AGORA AMAZON FROM ARCHER GROUP Athens, Agora Museum, S 2113. Relief. H c. 0.305; W c. 0.27m; D. 0.10m. Pentelic marble. From Athens, found behind Stoa of Attalos, 1959. Antonine period. The fragment is very weathered from being in a marble pile in modern times. The only parts which are not weathered are the hollows of folds near the belt. It was found in 1959 in a marble pile left by earlier excavators behind the Stoa of Attalos. It was probably built into the late Roman fortification. The low relief and the thin background make it unlikely that it comes from the same work as S 1357 (the Agora helper group). This fragment of a relief shows the skirt and belted waist of an Amazon seen from back view. It can be identified as a copy of the Amazon from the archer group from the top right quadrant of the shield of Athena Parthenos. The skirt is longer than in other copies of this type. The scale and projection of the figure accord with other figures on the Piraeus reliefs,</page><page sequence="267">248 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS but the workmanship is coarser: in particular the use of the running drill makes a channel separating the figure from the background.

Part of the upper edge survives. Despite the damage, the details of the relief are quite visible. This fragment of a relief plaque preserves part of an Amazon seated in back view from the stone-thrower group of the shield of the Athena Parthenos.

The Amazon, who is seen from back view, was seated and she turned her head to the left, so that it is depicted in profile to the left. Her right arm, preserved to the middle of the lower arm, was lowered, probably holding her weapon, while in her left hand she held her shield, part of which can be seen in low relief. She wore an Attic helmet, adorned with a large griffin and a crest, and a short tunic tied at the waist. This figure is known from the Strangford and Patras shields.

Part of the panel frame is preserved, but otherwise the pieces are broken all round. The surface is somewhat worn, but it retains a good deal of the detail. The fragments come from a relief plaque which included the head of a dead Amazon, copied from the shield of the Athena Parthenos. This figure formed part of the stone- thrower group, which probably comprised six figures and which occupied the whole of the upper left quadrant of the shield. From these fragments one can see that the Amazon wore a cloak, which is shown falling around her head, and that her left arm hung down with her shield behind it. The fragments probably belong to the same plaque as inv. 2112, which shows the Amazon seated in back view. According to the Lenormant and Strangford copies, the figure was falling vertically. The Lenormant copy has her to the left of the central shield gorgoneion, while the Strangford copy has her further down on the same side. It seems most unlikely that these copies are accurate about either the pose or the position of this figure. The Vatican and Conservatori copies of the shield suggest that there is no room for this figure on the left side of the shield, particularly lower down. From the evidence of the Piraeus reliefs, where the figure is paired with the Amazon seated in back view and set in the upper part of the frame, it seems very probable that the dead Amazon was shown more or less horizontally, as if she had fallen to the ground, with her head and arms hanging down. If this is the case then she may have occupied the poorly documented space just above the left side of the gorgoneion, to the left of the Amazon seated in back view. This part is left blank in the Strangford copy. Stefanidou-Tiveriou identifies Piraeus inv. 2209, which shows feet pointing to the left, with the dead Amazon with her head down. This would confirm that the Amazon was not shown falling vertically but lying on the ground with her head hanging down to the right and her lower legs hanging down to the left. According to Harrison, however, the fragment probably belongs to the dead Greek 724 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) 23, no. 33, pl. 23b.</page><page sequence="269">250 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS in the pilos-wearer group from the bottom of the shield, since the feet are definitely crossed.725 BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

Part of the lower right frame and most of the bottom of the frame are preserved, but otherwise the relief panel is broken all round, and has substantial parts missing. The figure on the left has lost its left hand, half the shield rim, right hand and right lower leg and foot. The face is very worn. The figure on the right is preserved from the waist down, along with part of his chlamys. There is a break across this figure's upper right leg and the background on either side. The scale and style of this piece, which is close to that of the Piraeus reliefs, suggests that it comes from Attica, probably from the same workshop as the Piraeus reliefs. On a large rocky mound two figures step up towards each other in confrontation. On the left is a female figure holding a large round shield. She wears a chiton and tunic, and an Attic helmet. In her lowered right hand she once held a spear, now missing. On the right is the lower half of a male warrior with chlamys. The torsos of both figures are shown almost fully frontally, while the head of the woman is shown in profile to the right. This scene preserves two figures from the shield of the Athena Parthenos, but they have been adapted by the copyist.

BERLIN SPEARMAN FROM AXE GROUP (Fig. 6.61) Berlin, Staatliche Museum, 1842. Relief. H. 0.46m; W. 0.69m. Marble. From Salamis? Hadrianic. The fragment is broken all round, but it preserves part of the frame on the left side, which is very damaged. The figure in relief is in quite good condition, though the top of his shield rim is broken and his right hand is missing. The scale and style of this piece, which is close to that of the Piraeus reliefs, suggests that it comes from Attica, probably from the same workshop as the Piraeus reliefs. The fragment preserves the upper half of an unbearded Greek in a sleeveless, belted tunic, with a short, bulging overfold. On the shoulders the fabric is bunched up, and looks almost like a vest. It then forms a series of fine folds over the chest, which are covered on his sides by other folds, coming from the back, that are tucked into the waist belt. This characteristic arrangement, which is so different from that of the Piraeus (inv 2110) and Copenhagen copies, is closely followed in the Palazzo Giustiniani copy. Despite the difference in the drapery, the frontal torso, with the head in profile to the right, the large round shield on the left arm and the lowered right arm all show that this is another full scale copy of the spearman in the axe group from the centre of the left half of the shield of Athena Parthenos. Part of the skirt of this figure's chiton is probably preserved in Piraeus, inv. 2210. His head is uncovered and the hair is represented as a fairly thick mass of curls that lie flat on the head. This again is very like the Palazzo Giustiniani copy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Blümel, C. (1938) K 252, pls. 73-74. Stefanidou-Tiveriou, Th. (1979) 23, 50-51, 56, 75, 87f., 110, 170, pl. 45a. Strocka, V. M.

MUNICH SPEAR GROUP (Fig. 6.41) Munich spear group. Relief. H. 1.05m; W. 1.33m. D. 0.23m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. Antonine work. The relief is mended from three fragments. The surface is rather pitted. One breakline cuts across the Amazon's neck and right armpit. There is damage to the Amazon's right fingers, some of which are broken off, as well as to her face, in particular to the left eye, the nose, the mouth and chin. There is some damage to the end of the Greek's nose. The size, workmanship and subject of this relief all suggest that it belongs to the same group as the Neo- Attic Piraeus reliefs. The relief plaque shows a pair of figures from the shield of the Athena Parthenos. On the right is a bearded Greek wearing a chlamys, who steps up on a rocky mound with his right foot as he moves forward, both arms raised and clutching a double-headed axe. In front of him, on the same rocky ground, is an Amazon in a belted tunic fastened on the right shoulder only. Her left arm is lowered, the hand holding a bow, the end of which can be seen in relief, and her right arm is raised and bent, so that the hand reaches to the back of her head. Her legs are bent at the knees, her head is drooping. Both figures are known from other copies and their position on the shield of Athena Parthenos is indicated by the Conservatori fragment. In addition to the Conservatori fragment, the Greek appears on the Copenhagen plaque, fighting against an Amazon in the pose of the spearman from the axe group of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, while the Amazon can be seen on the Strangford shield and on a fragment from a sarcophagus from Aphrodisias (no. 75-17). Meyer argues that on the Strangford shield and the Aphrodisias sarcophagus a variant of the Amazon has been introduced, a figure who has the same pose but who is set horizontally, as if she were dead. He does not think that a dead Amazon in this pose figured on the Parthenos shield and, on the strength of the Munich relief and the Conservatori copy, restores the Amazon to the lower left quadrant of the original shield, below the axe group. Furthermore, despite the fact that, as on the Conservatori and Strangford shields, the Greek of the Munich relief is wielding an axe, Meyer argues convincingly that the axe is a copyist's alteration and that the position of his hands and cloak, as well as the pose of the Amazon, all make much more sense if one supposes that the Greek is holding a spear and stabbing the Amazon in the neck with it. On the Conservatori shield, the figure has lost his cloak. It has been replaced here by a scabbard, which is meaningless if the man is supposed to be using an axe as his weapon. And on the Strangford shield, although he does have a cloak, the figure is given the arm positions of the stone-thrower from the top of the Lenormant shield. He is also bald. The Strangford shield copyist was clearly influenced by Plutarch's story that two figures on the shield were supposed to represent Pheidias and Perikles. He seems to have adapted two figures to suit the description and placed them side by side for dramatic effect. This new arrangement</page><page sequence="273">254 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS also explains why he needed a dead Amazon in the lower right part of his composition. For if the figure striding to the right was supposed to be Perikles, then he needed an Amazon victim. BIBLIOGRAPHY Meyer, H. (1987) 295-321, pls. 29-34. 148. PIRAEUS 'THESEUS' FRAGMENT? Piraeus Museum, 2009. Relief. H. 0.199m; W. 0.343m. Marble. From Piraeus harbour. AD 117-138. The surface of the fragment is very damaged, and much of the relief carving is broken away. The thigh and knee of a left leg can be made out on the fragment. The leg belongs to a figure who is standing with legs apart. Strocka identified the fragment as part of the Amazon on Piraeus 2110, but Stefanidou-Tiveriou disagrees, stating that the fragment is too different in quality to belong with 2110. She also doubts that the subject is an Amazon, and suggests that it was perhaps 'Theseus' from the 'Antiope' group. BIBLIOGRAPHY Stefanidou-Tiveriou, Th. (1979) 24, cat. no. 35, pl. 23c. Strocka, V.

The smaller fragment preserves part of the left frame, the larger is broken all round. The surface of both fragments is quite damaged. The relief figure has lost most of his right arm and the upper part of his face. The surface of the drapery on the upper part of the torso is also quite damaged. These fragments preserve the upper part of a bearded warrior, wearing a pilos and a short-sleeved tunic, and carrying a round shield. He is shown three-quarters to the right, with his head in profile to the right. His right arm was brought forward, originally carrying a spear which would have passed horizontally in front of his face. This figure was positioned at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, in a group with an Amazon and a dead Greek beneath. This is perhaps the figure referred to by Plutarch {Per. 3 1 , 3^4), commonly identified as Perikles. These fragments are thought to belong with a piece formerly in Salamis Museum, now in Piraeus, showing the lower half of his Amazon adversary.726 BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) pl. 110, fig. 325.

The fragment is broken all round, and has a pitted and rather damaged surface. The figure in relief, of which only the lower part survives, has lost - except in outline - its lower left leg and foot. The piece was found in the museum storeroom in Salamis in 1966 and identified as belonging to the Piraeus relief, inv. 221 1+2004 because of its style, form and subject. The fragment preserves the lower body of a figure in a short tunic, advancing to the right. The left leg, which is set forwards and bent at the knee, is shown from side view, while the trailing right leg is straight and shown from front view. The right leg wears a fur-lined, knee-high boot, with crossing thongs. This figure has rightly been identified by Stefanidou-Tiveriou as the Amazon adversary of the so-called pilos-wearer, from the group set at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. This figure can be seen on the Patras shield, and her left leg is also preserved on the Agora shield. On the Strangford shield, however, she has been transformed into a male figure.

This piece preserves the upper torso of the pilos-wearer from the group set at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, in a group with an Amazon and a dead Greek beneath.

Parian marble. From Ampurias, Paleochristian basilica. Roman work, perhaps Augustan. The relief slab was cut to its present dimensions in early Christian times and reused as an altar. For this purpose, the relief decorations were levelled and the slab was used with its back face uppermost. This side was smoothed and adorned with a simple moulded border. All that remains of the relief decorations of the other side is a rocky landscape, the outlines of four figures and a few details in low relief. These details are enough to confirm that the slab was originally adorned with figures copying the Amazonomachy of the Athena Parthenos shield. The partially preserved forms of four figures can be seen. None of the figures are complete, suggesting that the original slab of marble was considerably larger, measuring at least 1.80-90m by 1.50m, if not more, depending on how many other figures were included in the relief. In the lower right corner are the upper parts of the two figures in the Greek helper group, best known from the Lateran relief and the Patras shield, but also partially preserved in Piraeus reliefs nos. 2208 and 2018, and the Agora relief, S 1357. The upper left arm of the helper and the folds of cloth falling behind him from his chlamys are quite well preserved. The outline of his head shows that he is looking up, unlike his counterpart on the Lateran shield, who looks down at his wounded comrade. The upward gaze confirms that the pair of figures belongs in a larger group. In the left corner are the remains of an Amazon drawing her sword. This figure is known from the Patras and Strangford shields, as well as Piraeus relief no. 2206 and the very fragmentary no. 2000. The Amazon was originally striding uphill ready to attack the wounded Greek down on one knee, the so-called Kapaneus. Some folds of the Amazon's dress can be seen billowing out behind her as she strides to the proper left and her bent left arm is clearly visible. A small hole set in a raised square of stone above the skirt folds perhaps indicates where the scabbard of the sword was attached in metal. Although the Patras and Strangford shields do not agree with the Piraeus relief concerning the exact pose of this Amazon, they do give the figure the same relative position on the outer edge of the shield in the top right part, that is, above the group of three and not near the Greek helper group as here. The last and very damaged figure, which is set at the top of this relief and is preserved from about the waist downwards, is the lower Amazon of the group of three, well known from Piraeus relief no. 2123, as well as the Patras and Strangord shields. The outline of the extended left leg and the bent and kneeling right leg can clearly be seen as well as the mass of drapery covering the body, of which a few folds fluttering out to the left have been preserved. Both the Patras and Strangford shields position this figure on the outer edge of the shield, above the Greek helper group. BIBLIOGRAPHY Vivó i Codina, D. (1996) 213-22, figs. 1-8. 156.

This fragment was found in Cyrene and transferred to the museum, but it is now lost. It is part of a relief panel showing a gorgoneion which, according to Floren, might be a copy of the shield gorgoneion of the Athena Parthenos. The Gorgon has a wide, fat face, and her tongue protrudes from her mouth. Her hair is centrally parted and arranged in wavy locks. She is surrounded by a crown of curling snakes. These are arranged in a distinctive pattern, for they are coiled up and set in four pairs which resemble figures of eight. They do not intertwine. This unusual arrangement, together with the fact that the snakes are set very close to the Gorgon's head in such a way that there is no space between her head and the snakes, makes this fragment unique. The evidence from the Patras and the Conservatori fragments suggests a rather different arrangement for the original, with snakes set at some distance from the Gorgon and with bodies intertwining to form a continuous crown.

The krater had a Dionysiac scene on one side and a Gigantomachy scene on the other. The Gigantomachy scene is thought by some to reflect the barely known design on the inner surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. A semicircular band, adorned with a leaf motif, separates two parts of a scene. Outside this band, or arch, can be seen Helios and his quadriga on the right side and Selene on her mule on the left side. Much of what was in between is now lost, but one can still see part of Zeus 's chariot near the centre at the top. Inside the band can be seen seven giants, as well as Ge, emerging from the earth on the far right side.

ATHENA OF PELLENE 7.1. WRITTEN EVIDENCE Pausanias states that the statue of Athena at Pellene was chryselephantine and that it was housed in a temple of local stone. He adds that, according to the local guides, it was by Pheidias, and it was believed to be earlier in date than his Athena Areia at Plataia and the Athenas on the Akropolis: the great bronze Athena, the Parthenos and the Lemnia.730 If this is correct then the statue was made some time before the mid-fifth century, by which date the great bronze Athena was completed, perhaps even considerably earlier. Both Klein and Furtwängler denied Pheidian authorship of the Athena of Pellene, arguing that the claim was made simply on the grounds of the statue's technique and considerable antiquity.731 Ridgway comments on the not uncommon practice of attributing works to famous names, in order to attract interest, and she finds it doubtful that a commission for a chryselephantine temple statue in Pellene would have preceded the creation of the Athena Parthenos in Athens.732 On the basis of the interest Pausanias shows in the conservation of the ivory, a subject which he deals with again only in connection with the Athena Parthenos, the Zeus at Olympia and the Asklepios at Epidauros, it may be thought that the Pellene statue, which unfortunately is not described in any written source known, was of monumental size. If this was the case, then it is possible that it dated from after the Parthenos, of which it was not just the technique but also the size which impressed people and which influenced subsequent works. Another factor which may point to a post Parthenos date for the Pellene statue, despite the claims of the local guides, is that the Doric temple excavated at Pellene has been dated to the late 5th or early 4th century BC on architectural grounds.733 It has not been proved that this is indeed the temple Pausanias visited but, if it is, then it suggests that its holy image was probably made at about the same time. 730 Pausanias, VII.27.2. 731 Klein (1883) 69; Furtwängler (1895/1964) 57. 732 Ridgway (1981) 169. 733 Papachatzis (1980) 169. 273</page><page sequence="293">274 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 7.2. COINS AND POSSIBLE REPLICAS The Athena of Pellene has sometimes been equated with the image of Athena depicted on certain local Achaian coins of Roman date (Fig. 7.1).734 The image on the coins is of the traditional 'Promachos' type: Athena holds a shield, adorned with a gorgoneion, on her left arm while her right hand holds a raised lance. But unlike the striding Archaic 'Promachos', this figure stands with the right leg relaxed and bent at the knee, the foot set slightly to one side. One statue which would seem to tally with the Pellene coins, though it is heavily Romanized and the pose inverted, is the Dresden torso (Fig. 7.2).735 In an attempt to explain why a provincial Greek statue such as the Athena of Pellene should have had enough influence to be copied in Rome, albeit with variations, Linfert puts forward the following theory.736 He suggests that the Roman copy in Dresden, though resembling the Pellene coin type, is a copy of another Achaian work, the Athena Tritaia. When Pausanias was touring Achaia he visited the temple of Athena in Tritaia, but he says that all he saw there was a 'modern' stone statue, made to replace the old one which, according to the locals, had been transported to Rome.737 He adds that the goddess shared her temple here with Ares. Linfert thinks that the original temple image may have been the Athena statue taken to Rome by Aemilius Paullus and dedicated in the Temple of the Fortune of the Day, which Pliny includes amongst the bronze works of Pheidias.738 Unfortunately Prokopios, who also saw this statue, does not say who made it.739 As to the date of the Athena Tritaia, Linfert offers two possibilities: since Pheidias was working in Achaia, at Pellene, some time before the mid-fifth century BC, he may have made the Tritaia statue in his early years too, since Tritaia is also in Achaia. Alternatively, the work may belong to Pheidias 's late phase, since Tritaia is in fact nearer to Olympia than Pellene. The Temple of Fortuna Huiusce Diei and its finds in the Largo Argentina have been treated in a very thorough manner by both Coarelli and Martin. They show that the association with the Dresden statue is very doubtful.740 The temple was not erected until around 100 BC, while Aemilius Paullus, who was supposed to have brought Pheidias's statue to Rome, lived in the early and mid-second century BC. For the evidence from the temple see further discussion in the chapter concerning the Athena Hope/Farnese. Another theory which has been put forward concerning the statue in Dresden is by Schürmann.741 He believes the statue might be the cult image or a copy of the cult-image 734 For which see Imhoof-Blumer &amp; Gardner (1885-1887, 1964 reprint) pl.

An altar relief in the Antiquarium Comunale in Rome, found near the Marcellus theatre, in the area of the Forum Holitorium, shows a very similar Minerva figure represented as a cult image in the presence of craftsmen. The main cult for the craftsmen in Rome was on the Aventine and coin images depict the appearance of the Minerva image worshipped there. There are parallels with the Dresden statue, though also differences, but it is possible, as Schürmann cautiously suggests, that the Aventine cult image inspired the lesser cult image in the Forum Holitorium. 7.3.

The fragmentary statue is preserved from the neck to the thighs. The head and most of the neck, both of the lower arms, parts of the upper arms, both knees, the lower legs and feet and part of the upper left leg are all missing. The back is unfinished. Athena stands with her weight resting on her right leg, while the left leg is very slightly relaxed and set forward. The left arm is raised and held out to the side, while the upper right arm is held down along the side. As far as one can judge from what remains of the neck, it seems that the head was turned slightly towards the figure's right. The goddess wears a chiton, peplos and aegis. The aegis is very large, covering the upper body and left arm like a cape, and falling to thigh-level at the back. Its front surface is decorated with a scale pattern, bordered with twisting snakes which are executed in high relief. In the lower part at the front is a gorgoneion with small snakes knotted under the chin, hair flying to each side of the face and wings sprouting from the top of the head. The chiton is visible on the right upper arm. The peplos has a double overfold. One overfold reaches to the abdomen, the other to the top of the thighs. Two pleats of drapery in the upper overfold fall neatly over similar pleats in the lower overfold, giving the front of the peplos a distinctive arrangement. In contrast, the design at the back is very plain, suggesting that this statue was intended to be seen primarily from the front. BIBLIOGRAPHY Hermann, P. (1925) 19, no. 40. Linfert, A.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE The sources record that Pheidias made a colossal bronze statue of Athena. It stood out of doors on the Akropolis and immediately became a famous Athenian landmark (Figs. 8.2-4).742 The composition consisted of a standing figure of the goddess wearing a helmet, and holding an upright lance. She also had a shield, adorned with engravings depicting a Centauromachy. According to Pausanias, these engravings were designed by the painter Parrhasios and executed by the engraver Mys.743 Since Pliny states, in Book 35.65, that Parrhasios was a contemporary of Zeuxis (whom he dates to the 95th Olympiad, that is 400-397 BC), it is often thought that the shield must have been decorated some time after the statue was made. But it is possible that Pliny's dating is not to be trusted or that the artists Pausanias names are earlier homonyms.744 The statue was colossal in size, a fact which cannot be doubted when one looks at representations of the work, albeit roughly executed and with no precision in the scale, on Roman coins of the 1st century AD which depict the Akropolis from the north. Pausanias does not state how big the work was, and the two pieces of information he gives concerning this matter appear difficult to reconcile. Firstly, he says that the Athena Areia of Plataia, which stood within a temple, was not much smaller.745 Secondly, he says that the tip of the spear and the crest of the helmet could be seen by sailors out at sea as they approached Athens from Sounion. The latter statement suggests that these parts of the statue both reached well above any buildings that stood on the Akropolis between the statue and the Sounion direction. The poros foundations of the base have been located between the Propylaia and the Erechtheion, approximately 40m east of the Propylaia, the axis of that building almost exactly aligned with the base. One intervening building which the statue must have surpassed in height, therefore, in order to be visible out at sea, was the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia. By about 480 BC sculptors had mastered the sophisticated techniques required for making bronze statues to a height of at least fifteen feet: Pausanias mentions a statue of Zeus by Anaxagoras of Aigina set up at Olympia shortly after 479 BC, which measured ten cubits in height and elsewhere he refers to the equally large statue of Herakles by Onatas of Aigina.746 It seems likely that sculptors working a generation later would have 742 See also Korres's reconstruction of the Athenian Akropolis in Hurwit (1999) fig. 124. 743 Pausanias, 1.28.2. 744 So Mathiopoulos (1968) 12.

The evidence from the building accounts shows that the statue took about 9 years to build. Pliny records that the Colossus of Rhodes, which measured 105ft, and the Mercury of Zenodorus, which measured 106.5ft, took, respectively, twelve years and ten years to build, while the Athena Parthenos which was twenty-six cubits high, according to Pliny, took about nine years to build.747 Alkamenes's statues of Athena and Hephaistos for the Hephaisteion took five years to build. The size of the statues is not known. If Harrison is correct in attributing the Athena Velletri type to the Athena, then this statue and its pair might have been about 3m high.748 On the other hand, if Harrison is wrong in rejecting the identity of the building formerly known as the 'Theseion' in the Athenian Agora as the Hephaisteion temple, then the images must have been substantially smaller than this, for the temple naos would not have been spacious enough to house two such large images. Unfortunately, the size of the statue base does not help one ascertain the height of the colossal Athena statue which once stood upon it. Traces of the joints of the course of blocks immediately above the foundations prove that these blocks were c. 0.16m wide and weather marks show that they were set back from the edge of the foundations by c. 0. 16m. From these facts one may deduce that the upper course measured c. 5.26m by c. 5.26m, that is about 16 Attic feet. This basic measurement does not reveal whether the base occupied the whole of this area or whether it was substantially smaller and had a platform around it, as Stevens proposed.749 Weber's research has shown, moreover, that in the high Classical period statue bases tended to have a more or less standard height of about two cubits, irrespective of the size of the statue.750 The pedestal, made of Pentelic marble and Eleusinian limestone, was carved with a massive bead and reel and egg and dart (Fig. 8.1). On the basis of how long it took to make the statue, Pheidias's great bronze must have been larger than Alkamenes's statues but smaller than the colossi of Chares and Zenodorus. According to Stevens, a height of some 7.5m would have been sufficient to make the top of the statue visible out at sea.751 At the other end of the spectrum, Dinsmoor estimated a height of 16.36m, that is 30 cubits, or 50 Attic feet, including the pedestal.752 This would have made the great bronze Athena 10m shorter than the top of the Parthenon pediments and 6m higher than the summit of the Propylaia. The height is estimated partly on the evidence of the remains of the statue base which he thought might have been around 8 Attic feet high. The statue alone, therefore, would have been around 42 Attic feet, that is 3 Attic feet smaller than the Apollo of Kalamis, which was the tallest of all the 5th century colossi.753 Stevens was of the opinion that the maximum height of about 16m, proposed 747 For the Colossus of Rhodes and the Mercury of Zenodorus, see Pliny, NH 34.41 and 44. For the height of the Athena Parthenos, see Pliny NH 36.18. 748 See Harrison (1977) 139. 749 See Raubitschek and Stevens (1946) 107, fig. 1.

That Dinsmoor's estimate is perhaps on the large side might be confirmed by Pausanias's eye-witness account that the Athena Areia at Plataia, which stood inside a temple, was not much smaller than the 'Promachos'. One may doubt the accuracy of Pausanias's judgement in this matter, and assume that it was affected by the very different settings of the two works - one crowded inside a temple naos, the other standing amidst numerous imposing buildings - but Pausanias would surely have been struck more forcefully by the size of the statue if it had been as tall as Dinsmoor suggested. An estimated height of somewhere between seven and ten metres, that is, between about 23-33 feet, is probably closer to the mark.754 The statue was made later than the Athena of Pellene, according to Pausanias. Lewis's analysis of the construction accounts, which reveal that the work took about nine years to complete, led him to conclude that the accounts were written c. 450 BC when the work was completed.755 The nature of the accounts, which relate primarily to the expenditure of large sums of money on copper, tin and wages for the workforce, points to the creation of a colossal bronze work, undertaken at public expense by the Athenians, and dedicated on the Akropolis a little before 450 BC. The 'Promachos' fits the bill very well. Some argue that the mention of the purchase of copper and tin in the accounts until almost the end of the project makes it more likely that these accounts concern a statue group rather than a single statue. Apart from the fact that there is no extant record of any such statue group made for the Akropolis at this period, it is clear from the preserved figures that the amounts of copper and tin purchased in the later years of the project are significantly smaller than those acquired, for instance, in year 2/3. The accounts are therefore not inconsistent with those for a single statue, for it might be the case that whereas the main bulk of the figure was made in the early years of the project, the later years saw the production of the smaller, attached pieces, the piecing together of the parts, and the making good of the joins. A 5th century BC moulding pit, suitable for the creation of just such a work, has been found on the south side of the Akropolis.756 It is very likely that work on the statue was carried out in a workshop nearby. It is not certain whether two marble blocks with remains of a dedicatory inscription found on the Akropolis can be linked with the 'Promachos' dedication or not.757 In the first place, the remains of the inscription itself are so fragmentary, with only three letters on each block, that there is no general agreement as yet about what the likely restoration of the inscription should be. Raubitschek and Stevens restored the dedication as "The Athenians made the dedication from Median spoils" and linked it to the 'Promachos' statue.758 But Lewis had reservations both about this restoration and about the possibility of linking the inscription, which he regarded as dating from not much later than 480 BC, 754 Niketas Choniates, Diegesis.De Isaacio Angelo et Alexio, 738B, records the destruction of a thirty-foot statue of Athena in Constantinople in the early 13th century. This may well have been the great bronze Athena of Pheidias, though definitive evidence is lacking. 755 IG I3 435. 756 Zimmer (1990) 62-71. 151 IGI3 505. 758 Raubitschek and Stevens (1946) 107-14.</page><page sequence="299">280 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS with the 'Promachos', securely dated to the 450s BC.759 Other evidence, concerning the manner in which the blocks were cut and finished, supports the view that the blocks were used for a completely different and unrelated purpose.760 The statue was an offering of thanks after war, but there is disagreement in the sources about exactly why and by whom it was dedicated.761 According to Pausanias, it was set up by the Athenians to commemorate Marathon, but Demosthenes says in a more general way that it commemorated the defeat "of the barbarians" and was paid for by "the Greeks".762 The fact that the statue was set up a good quarter of a century after Marathon suggests that it may have been part of Kimon's project to embellish the Akropolis after Eurymedon, for the victory at Marathon was led by Miltiades, Kimon's father. Pausanias says, perhaps erroneously, that the Athena Areia at Plataia, which was also made by Pheidias, was likewise built from the spoils of Marathon. Another monument linked with Marathon, that was also said to be made by Pheidias, was the Delphi statue group and this work certainly honoured Miltiades. The celebration of Marathon not only entailed the glorification of Miltiades, but also that of Athens, to the detriment of Sparta. For Marathon had been an entirely Athenian victory over the Persian enemy. 8.2. THE NAME OF THE STATUE In ancient times the colossal bronze Athena was generally known as 'the bronze Athena' or 'the great bronze Athena'. Of the secure references to this statue, most refer to the work in this manner.763 In one passage, Aristides refers to the statue as 'the statue from Marathon', in an allusion to the supposed reason for its dedication.764 The only secure reference to this statue as the 'Promachos' occurs in a scholion to Demosthenes, Contra Androt. 13, which describes the various statues of Athena on the Akropolis and states that the statue called 'Promachos' was made entirely of bronze and that it was dedicated after the victory at Marathon. The note is not altogether trustworthy.765 Its date is unknown. It comes from 759 Lewis (1994) 505. 760 See the notes concerning IG I3 505 in Volume 2, Inscriptions. 761 Not all the references to this statue in the sources are equally helpful or reliable. One of the scholia to Aristides 1.354 (C), says that the statue was by Praxiteles, while one of the scholia to Aristides, 3.336 (Oxon), discussing the significance of the phrase 'from Marathon', questions whether this means brought from there or set up as a memorial of victory there. 762 Pausanias, 1.28.2; Demosthenes, De falsa leg. 272. 763 Demosthenes, De falsa leg. 272, in the 4th century BC; Pausanias, 1.28.2; IX.4.1, in the 2nd century AD; Aristides, Or. 34.28, in the 2nd century AD; Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.317ff., in the 12th century AD. 764 Aristides, Or. 3.336. 765 The scholiast says there are three statues of Athena on the Akropolis: the Polias, the Promachos, and the Parthenos. But what, for instance, of the Lemnia? He names Pheidias as the maker of the Parthenos, but he does not attribute the ' Promachos ' to anyone. He suggests,</page><page sequence="300">ATHENA 'PROMACHOS' 28 1 a manuscript dating from the 10th or 11th century AD, but it may have been written as early as the Hellenistic period. A terminus ante quern of the late 5th century AD is indicated by the author's reference to the presence of the Athenas Parthenos, 4 Promachos ' and Polias on the Athenian Akropolis at the time of writing. Principally because of this evidence, the name 'Promachos' has clung to Pheidias's great bronze Athena, but this may not have been what the work was called in the sculptor's own day. The word 'promachos' means 'fighting before', or 'in front of; hence as an epithet it denotes 'foremost fighter' or 'champion'. This epithet is found applied to Athena by several authors in late antiquity, as well as to other tutelary gods, such as Hermes and Herakles.766 Writing in the 5th century AD, Zosimos uses the name 'Promachos' for an apparition of the goddess seen by Alaric, the Visigothic leader, on the walls of Athens, along with Achilles, when he was about to attack the city.767 Zosimos says that Alaric was unable to bear the sight and so he gave up his plan and the city was saved. Most interesting is Zosimos 's description of the Athena Promachos: she was apparently as one can see her in numerous statuettes, fully armed and about to attack. This suggests that the name 'Promachos' was applied to a statue type, but that this type was of the goddess in action, such as one finds in numerous Archaic statuettes - striding forwards with the right hand raised ready to hurl a spear and the left holding a shield in defensive position. From the evidence of Roman coins showing a view of the Akropolis and from the words of Pausanias, 1.28.2, it seems clear that Pheidias's statue portrayed the goddess standing immobile, with one leg relaxed and slightly bent at the knee, and her spear resting upright at her side, its tip visible to mariners in the Saronic Gulf. An epigram of Apronianos (no. 432), found in the Athenian Agora, tells of a statue of Herkoulios set up 'next to Athena Promachos'. The inscription dates from the early 5th century AD. Whether it is of any relevance or not is difficult to assess, for there is no proof that the Athena Promachos in question was the statue by Pheidias. The fact that the inscription was found in the Agora and not on the Akropolis is not necessarily significant since much material from the Akropolis was later found in the Agora. One source surprisingly absent from the list of secure references to Pheidias's great bronze Athena is Pliny, NH 34.54, the passage in which Pliny lists Pheidias's works in bronze. He says, "In bronze, besides the Amazon . . . , he made a Minerva of such outstanding beauty that she received the name 'the beautiful'. He also made a 'cliduchus' and another Minerva, which Paullus Aemilius dedicated at Rome, at the temple of the Fortune of the Day, and also two draped statues ... as well as a colossal nude statue". This list is rather odd for it does not appear to include the great bronze Athena, the Apollo Parnopios, and the Marathon dedication in Delphi, all of which Pausanias attributes to Pheidias, while it includes several statues which are very difficult to identify: the 'cliduchus', the Athena taken to Rome by A. Paullus, the two draped statues, and the almost certainly mistakenly, that the 'Promachos' dates from the period between the battles of Marathon and Salamis. 766 por Athena 'Promachos' see, for instance, Alkiphron, Ep.

Nova , V.6.1-2.</page><page sequence="301">282 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS colossal nude. The first Minerva statue mentioned is usually taken to refer to the Lemnia, and this identification would seem to be justified since other sources confirm the exceptional beauty of this work. But what of the next two statues? The subject of the 'cliduchus' is not clear. The Greek word KXeiôoûxoç means 'holding the keys', and so it can signify having charge or custody of a place. Pliny alone seems to use the word in Latin, to denote statues by Pheidias and, in NH 34.78, by Euphranor. Suggestions for the subject of such a statue include a votive priestess holding keys, or the guardian of a sanctuary. But there is no evidence to confirm Pliny's statement that Pheidias ever treated such subjects. So is Pliny just making a mistake? It is also rather odd that he includes the cliduchus between two statues of Minerva. The structure of the sentence, which begins fecit et cliduchum et aliam Mineruam . . . has been interpreted as meaning that the cliduchus was in fact a statue of Minerva. If this is true, then this may be the apparently missing reference to the great bronze Athena. And indeed the title KXeiôoôxoç, which is used of a great number of characters in Greek literature, is also found used once of Athena, the tutelary goddess.768 Such a title would not be inappropriate for the great bronze Athena which, after all, stood directly beyond the Propylaia, guarding the citadel. But this interpretation too is doubtful. No other commentator calls the statue by this title; there is no evidence that the goddess was portrayed holding keys; and, finally, it would mean that Pliny was breaking his own convention with regard to the naming of statues, which was to call gods by their proper names, sometimes adding to this a popular title or sobriquet, while giving to statues of mortals a descriptive title drawn from their attitude or attributes.769 In this case, one would have expected Pliny to call Minerva by her name, even if he had afterwards added the title 'cliduchus'. So did Pliny misunderstand his source here, telling him that there was an Athena Kleidouchos by Pheidias or was there really a statue of a votive priestess by Pheidias, according to the source? At any rate, one can be sure that the great bronze Athena cannot be the statue which A. Paullus removed to Rome, and which was set up as the cult statue of the temple of the Fortune of the Day towards 100 BC.770 Roman Imperial coins of the 1st century AD show a view of the Akropolis from the north side which clearly indicates the presence of the great bronze figure in Athens at this period. In the 2nd century AD it was recorded on the Akropolis by Pausanias and it may well have been seen there in the 4th century AD by Hieronymus. 771 768 For the use of the title with reference to Athena, see Aristophanes, Thesmo. 1 142.

THE HISTORY OF THE STATUE In a now famous passage in his history, Niketas describes a riot which took place in the Forum of Constantine in Constantinople in AD 1203, when a bronze statue of Athena was smashed to pieces by a drunken crowd.772 The detailed description of this work, which sounds like an important Classical Greek statue, would seem to fit in with what is known of the great bronze Athena by Pheidias, as far as one can judge from Pausanias's description of this work and the sketchy outlines of the figure seen on certain Roman coins of the 1st century AD. According to Niketas, the statue stood on a 'stele' in the forum and it measured about thirty feet high. The goddess wore an ankle-length garment tightly belted at the waist and over it an aegis, complete with gorgoneion. Her neck was uncovered. On her head she wore a helmet with a horse-hair crest and her hair could be seen escaping from beneath the helmet on to her forehead. At the back, the hair was plaited. Her left hand held the folds of her dress, while the right was outstretched towards the south. Both the pose and the dress would appear to suit the Athena 'Promachos'. The arm movements were perhaps not understood simply because the statue had by the 13th century lost its shield, spear and the object held in the outstretched hand. As far as one can gather from the material evidence for this statue, one arm was down by the statue's side, perhaps touching the top of the shield which rested on the ground by her feet, while the other was bent at the elbow and stretched forward holding some object. A height of approximately thirty feet for this statue would not be surprising, to judge from the truly colossal proportions the 'Promachos' is shown to have on the Roman coins. It is not clear exactly what Niketas means by a 'stele' under the statue, but if the statue was the 'Promachos', then this cannot have been more than a low base of some sort. Unfortunately, Niketas does not record who made the sculpture nor where it came from. The subject of the colossal Athena statue in the Forum of Constantine is confused by a note about a bronze Athena perhaps by Pheidias written in AD 907 by the bishop, Arethas.773 Commenting on a passage in Aristides, Or. 34.28, he says that he thinks the bronze Athena by Pheidias is the one which was standing in his day in the Forum of Constantine, on one side of the entrance to the Senate House. The statue of a woman crowned with crabs, he says, stood opposite the Athena. Arethas's description of two female statues standing outside the Senate House fits in with a description in Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.565, written in the late 11th. or early 12th century AD. Kedrenos says the figures were Athena on the west side and Amphitrite on the east. He adds that the Athena was Lindian and that the Amphitrite too came from Rhodes. Kedrenos's description of the Athena is not very detailed but in certain respects it fits in with that of the statue seen by Niketas: the goddess outside the Senate House wore a helmet and a gorgoneion. In addition, we know that since the Senate House was situated on the north side of the Forum of Constantine, Kedrenos's goddess must have faced south, like Niketas's statue. Kedrenos also specifies, however, that she had snake necklaces wound about her throat and that she stood at ground level. In addition, he says that she came from Lindos in Rhodes. One of the major objections in trying to identify the statue of Athena which stood outside the Senate House with the statue described by Niketas is its size. Clearly, both 772 Niketas, De Isaac. 73 8B. 773 Note, however, that Arethas is not always a very reliable source.</page><page sequence="303">284 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Arethas and Kedrenos saw a pair of statues, standing in complementary fashion on either side of the entrance to an important building. Whatever their true identity, they must have appeared as a pair, presumably of about the same size, since they were popularly referred to, according to Arethas, as 'Earth' and 'Sea'. Neither Arethas nor Kedrenos comment on the sizes of these statues, but it is difficult to imagine how a pair of thirty foot high statues would make an appropriate adornment for the entrance to a building, or how one thirty foot high statue could be paired with a much smaller statue. The only way round this is to agree with Linfert that the statue was in fact much smaller and that the measurement Niketas gives includes the pillar on which the statue was displayed. But in that case the statue Niketas describes surely cannot be the 'Promachos'.774 For the same reason it is difficult to be convinced that the Byzantine miniature of the 1 1th century AD, which shows a Classical Athena on top of a column, is a reflection of the Athena 'Promachos', as Jenkins claims.775 Linfert has suggested that 'Lindian' is a misunderstanding of the correct title 'Lemnian'.776 He therefore maintains that the statue referred to by both Arethas and Kedrenos was the Athena Lemnia of Pheidias, and that this was one and the same as the statue described by Niketas. He thinks it is much more likely that the Lemnia was the statue in the Forum of Constantine and not the 'Promachos' for several reasons. He says that the Athena 'Promachos' would have been too large to stand on any sort of pillar, as seems to have been the case for the statue described by Niketas, and the measurement of thirty feet can be explained if one includes both the statue and its pillar. The statue in Constantinople is further described as having made an odd, beckoning gesture towards the south with one hand and it was this, according to Niketas, which prompted the rioters to destroy the work since the gesture was interpreted as a sign of support for the enemies attacking the city at that time. Linfert thinks that this hand movement could well be explained by the fact that originally the hand held the goddess's helmet but, with the passage of time, the statue had been altered so that, by Niketas's day, the hand was empty and the helmet was perched on the head. According to Linfert, this would also explain the peculiar hair style, with locks escaping from beneath the helmet here and there. This theory does not stand up to a close examination of the sources for, as Frantz points out, Kedrenos not only says that one of the statues was the Athena Lindia but he adds, concerning the other statue, rjxQ1! 8è Kai auTiļ aTTÒ'Póòou which would not make sense unless he intended to say that the Athena too came from Rhodes.777 Frantz therefore concludes that 'Lindian' cannot be a mistake for 'Lemnian'. She nevertheless agrees that 'Lindian' is a mistake but, unlike Linfert, she remains of the traditional opinion that the statue was the one described by Niketas and that it was the 'Promachos' of Pheidias. But why would Kedrenos have made this mistake? Frantz ascribes it to the fact that Kedrenos had mentioned an Athena Lindia only one page earlier (1.564): this was the Athena of green stone which had once stood in the Palace of Lausos, until it was destroyed by fire in AD 774 Linfert (1982) 57ff. 775 Jenkins (1947) 31-33. 776 Linfert (1982) 57ff. 777 Frantz (1988) 77.</page><page sequence="304">ATHENA TROMACHOS' 285 475.778 If one examines the two passages in Kedrenos, 1.564 and 1.616, it is clear that there were at one time at least two statues from Lindos in the Palace of Lausos. One of these was of green stone, the other was of 'a different material'. They were both sent by the Pharaoh Amasis in the 6th century BC to Kleoboulos, tyrant of Rhodes. Xenagoras reports that both the statues were recorded in the Hellenistic Lindian Temple Chronicle, which described them as golden, and he adds that one was inscribed in Greek while the other bore an inscription in hieroglyphics.779 It is likely that their gold revetment had been removed by the 5th century AD. A more probable explanation of Kedrenos's idea that the statue came from Lindos is that he copied it from the source he was using, namely Konstantinos Rhodios, who also talks of an Athena Lindia in Constantinople.780 In his description of the seven wonders of Constantinople, Konstantinos, writing in the earlier 10th century AD, includes the Senate House built by Constantine. In relation to this building, he mentions the bronze door brought from the temple of Artemis at Ephesos and a bronze statue of Athena. Konstantinos links the statue with the Lindians and he says the figure is recognizably that of Pallas Athena because she has a helmet, a gorgoneion and snake chains around her neck. He also says that the image was set on a high column and that one hand was stretched out towards the sky. This description agrees quite closely with that of Kedrenos, the main difference being that Konstantinos 's statue was on top of a high column while that described by Kedrenos was on the ground. It is possible that the column was removed in the period between the time of Konstantinos and that of Kedrenos. If this is the case and they are both talking of the same statue, then the objections to identifying this statue with the one Niketas describes still stand: Konstantinos 's statue had snake chains round her neck and she was of a size which permitted that she stood on top of a high column. It seems probable that Konstantinos, Arethas and Kedrenos are all talking of the same statue. Why, then does Konstantinos think that the statue came from Lindos and was he mistaken in this opinion? These questions are difficult to answer without further evidence. Konstantinos may have been correct in thinking that the work came from Lindos. After all, other statues from there are known to have been brought to Constantinople. There were two Athenas from Lindos in the Palace of Lausos until they were destroyed by fire in AD 475. There was also an Athena from Lindos standing outside the Senate House on the eastern side of the Forum of the Augusteion in the early fifth century AD. Zosimos reports that when fire devastated the area in AD 404, the only objects which survived were the two statues on bases in front of the doors of the Senate House, which people called the Zeus of Dodona and the Athena of Lindos.781 It remains possible that Konstantinos was mistaken in his information and that the error crept in due to confusion about which of the Senate Houses of Constantinople was being described in his sources. In ancient descriptions of Constantinople it is often very unclear which of the two Senate Houses is being discussed. The Senate of the Augusteion was the second Senate House of Constantinople, and both this building and the Senate House in the Forum of Constantine were constructed under 778 See Kedrenos, 1.616. 779 See Blinkenberg (1941) 188-92. 780 Ekphrasis, lines 153-62. 781 Zosimos, Hist. Nova , V.24.7-8.</page><page sequence="305">286 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Constantine the Great. The Senate House of the Forum of Constantine was damaged by fire in AD 462 and later rebuilt, and the other Senate was damaged by fire not only in AD 404, but again in AD 532. The evidence for the presence of the 'Promachos' in Constantinople until the early 13th century AD is not conclusive. It is possible that the 'Promachos' is the statue described by Niketas, but it seems less likely that it is also the statue described by Arethas and Kedrenos. There may well have been a pair of bronze statues outside the entrance to the Senate House as well as another, colossal statue of Athena somewhere else in the same forum. One of the grounds for believing that the three authors are all talking of the same statue is the fact that the statues described faced south. And yet since the Senate House in question was on the north side of the forum and it was clearly an important building, it would have made sense to have all nearby statues facing south. Tzetzes's reference to the 'Promachos' does not help settle the issue.782 It has been thought that since his reference to the 'Promachos' occurs along with the mention of statues which were in Constantinople, then the 'Promachos' must have been in Constantinople too. This is a weak argument because, of the works in the city, some were definitely not by Pheidias, in particular the Anthelios Apollo in the Palace and the Herakles in the Hippodrome, while others, which were by Pheidias, such as the Athena Parthenos, were never brought to Constantinople. There is some evidence to indicate that the great bronze Athena remained on the Athenian Akropolis until at least the 5th century AD. Pausanias saw it there in the mid 2nd century AD and it was probably seen there by Hieronymus too, when he visited the Akropolis in AD 3 72. 783 If Apronianos is indeed referring to the 'Promachos', then he provides evidence that the statue was still in place in around AD 410. Frantz suggests that a likely time for its removal to Constantinople would have been some time in the last three quarters of the 5th century and the first three quarters of the 6th century AD, possibly after the rebuilding of the Senate House in the wake of the fire of AD 462. 784 8.4. MATERIAL EVIDENCE FOR THE TYPE The statue of Athena 'Promachos', which is mentioned several times in the written sources, has not yet been identified for certain in the visual arts, except on a few Roman coins. Though small and crude, the representations on these coins provide some important information about the general appearance of the lost statue. And even if they shed no light on many aspects of the iconography of the statue, they at least enable one to rule out a number of other images which have sometimes been associated with Pheidias 's great bronze but which are incompatible with them. The fact that it has proved so hard to identify the type of the great bronze statue is perhaps not very surprising. The colossal size of the statue would in itself have discouraged the making of faithful copies in the round. 782 Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.325. 783 pausaniasj 1.28.2; Hieronymus, Comm. in Zach. Proph. III. 12. 784 Frantz (1988) 76-77.</page><page sequence="306">ATHENA 'PROMACHOS' 287 Furthermore, attention perhaps focused on the magnificent Athena Parthenos, when this work appeared not many years later. The coins that provide the only known images of the Athena 'Promachos' of Pheidias are a group of Attic coins of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.785 On the reverse side they show a general view of the Akropolis from the north with a large female statue facing west towards the Propylaia, standing between the Propylaia and the Erechtheion. Given what is already known of the location and size of the 'Promachos' from the literary sources and archaeological remains on the Akropolis, there is little doubt that the image represented on this group of coins is indeed the statue in question. Athena is seen either in three-quarter view from the back turned towards the right, in profile to the right or laterally reversed in profile to the left (Figs. 8.2-4).786 She stands very erect, with one leg bearing the weight of her body, the other relaxed and set back. Sometimes the figure is shown standing on a base. This confirms that the image is indeed that of a statue. The arm of the relaxed side is held forward and bears a winged attribute, while the other arm hangs down by her side. On the earlier and best examples, the goddess has a spear leaning on her left shoulder and a shield resting on the ground next to her, which her hand rests upon.787 This last point is important as it means that images with the shield carried on the arm are probably not reflections of the 'Promachos'. Athena wears a garment with a belt. The exact nature of the dress is not known for certain, but its lack of folds and the stiff, column-like appearance of the statue in general suggest that the goddess wore a peplos, as one would expect for a work produced before the mid 5th century BC. She also wears a crested helmet, which is sometimes represented as Attic, and sometimes as Corinthian. Despite the die engravers' confusion, there is reason to believe that the 'Promachos' wore an Attic-style helmet, as did the Parthenos. Not only would an Attic helmet have been more appropriate than a Corinthian for propaganda reasons but, in addition, it seems more likely given the date of the statue. The Corinthian helmet does not appear to have become popular in Greek art until the second half of the 5th century BC, from which time it was depicted much more often than the Attic type.788 Further evidence to decide this matter would be useful. Since this group of coins places the image of Athena within a specific and recognizable location, there can be little doubt that they show Pheidias's statue. On the basis of this evidence, it is possible to state that several other representations of Athena, which disagree with the image recognized on these coins, probably do not illustrate the same statue. These 785 Mathiopoulos (1968) 13-17. This is her 'Group l'. Mathiopoulos has divided the coins into four main groups, three depicting the whole statue and one showing the bust alone. In this discussion, Mathiopoulos' s categories are followed. 786 For example, coin in Berlin; coin in London, British Museum 1922.3-17.82; coin in London, British Museum 1902.12-1.3 (cat. nos. (8) 1-3). Lundgreen (1997b) pl. Ia-c. 787 Cf Svoronos. (1923-26) pl. 98, nos. 19-20; Pick (1931) 65, pl. I 12, Beilage/encl. XXVIII.l; see also Kroll (1993) no. 280 with further examples and a discussion on 124 n. 64. 788 See Waywell (1971) 376. But the Early Classical head, Athens, Akropolis Museum, 2338, identified as Athena and attributed to the Marathon Monument by Despinis (2001) 108ff. seems to have worn a Corinthian helmet.</page><page sequence="307">288 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS include other images on coins, collected by Mathiopoulos, as well as two types of images on lamps, collected by Pick.789 On the basis of Kroll's work, it is probably correct to conclude that the coins which Mathiopoulos calls 'Group 2' 790 are irrelevant to a discussion of the 'Promachos', as they show a statue of Athena with different arm movements and attributes to those in group 1 .791 This group of coins dates from the last third or last quarter of the 3rd century BC.792 The goddess stands in profile to the right, with the right leg relaxed and set slightly back. She is placed on a base, and her proportions are youthful. She wears a peplos and a Corinthian helmet with one crest. Both arms are stretched out before her, one held higher than the other. The right hand, which is set lower, holds a patera, the higher left hand holds an owl.793 The divergences from the coins of group 1 are the patera in the right hand and the absence of the spear and shield. In addition, the helmet is always shown as Corinthian. The coins in group 1 are too indistinct to decide whether the winged creature in the outstretched hand was an owl or not, but since this group of coins diverges with regard to the movement of one of the arms and the attributes, it is not safe to draw inferences from it regarding the appearance of the 'Promachos' without further evidence. Another image which diverges strongly from that presented in the first group of coins is that of Mathiopoulos' s third group of coins.794 This group consists of Attic bronze coins and Alexandrian gold medallions dating from the second half of the 3rd century AD.795 On the reverse side of the disc Athena is seen standing in profile to the right, holding an owl in her right hand, and with a transverse spear leaning against the opposite side.796 Between the end of the spear and Athena's legs there is sometimes a snake coiled by her feet, or behind her a column with a facing owl. Some of the coins of group 3 suggest an outdoor location for the statue, as they show an olive tree growing behind Athena. Another characteristic of this group is that Athena is depicted wearing an aegis. As in the case of the examples from group 2, the figure of Athena bears some similarity to that shown on coins from group 1 . But there are no decisive reasons for interpreting the image on these coins and medallions as being the Pheidian bronze. On the contrary, the absence of the shield in this group makes the identification quite implausible.797 789 Mathiopoulos (1968) 17-25; Pick (1931). /yu Mathiopoulos (1968) 17-18. 791 Kroll (1982) 65-76. 792 Kleiner (1975) 302-30.

They are very common. They show the bust of Athena wearing a Corinthian helmet. Athena has a wave of hair on her forehead, which disappears beneath her helmet. The hair then falls in a single, thick, braided mass from about the level of her ears, which are hidden, down the nape of the neck and on to her back. On her chest she wears an aegis with snakes.800 According to Pick, the large number of Athenas wearing a Corinthian helmet, as opposed to the smaller group wearing an Attic helmet, shows that the former representation was more popular than the latter. He believed that the Athena in the Attic helmet depicts the Athena Parthenos, while the Athena in the Corinthian helmet depicts the Promachos, but this idea may be fanciful. His argument is to some extent based on the notion that images of the 'Promachos' and Parthenos "fought for supremacy" over each other, which he thought would explain why the two bust types even appear on either side of the same coin.801 From the evidence put forward above, this fourth group should probably be rejected, along with the second and third groups, since the identification is based solely on the type of helmet, the Corinthian, and there is as yet no reason to believe that the Athena 'Promachos' wore this type of helmet.802 The first group of lamps sometimes associated with the Athena 'Promachos' of Pheidias bears a bust of Athena in profile to the left. The goddess wears a Corinthian helmet. She has an aegis and, in some instances, she has a spear resting on her left shoulder.803 A substantial number of these lamps was found in the Athenian Agora, and the earliest of them were made locally in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The lamps date from the late 2nd century AD to the 6th century AD. They were copied from Russia to Egypt and in some cases made from moulds taken from an Attic lamp. The whole basis of the identification of the bust of Athena on these lamps with Athena Promachos is their similarity with the Athenian coins in group 4. Pick even suggested that they derived from the same stamps. The coins in group 1, however, do not reveal whether the 'Promachos' wore a Corinthian rather than an Attic helmet. Therefore, one cannot be certain that the bust of Athena wearing a Corinthian helmet which appears on the coins and lamps is the Athena 'Promachos'. On these grounds, both groups of materials should be ruled out as evidence for the appearance of this work. The second group of lamps which Pick has associated with the 'Promachos' depicts a standing figure of Athena, advancing to the left.804 Athena has a raised shield on her left 798 Svoronos (1923-1926) pls. 82-99; Pick (1931) 59-60; Kroll (1993) esp. 121. 799 Mathiopoulos (1968) 20-25. 800 For example, London, British Museum 1855.12-11.24. 801 Pick (1931) 61-63, pl. I, 1/2, 6/7. 802 Pick regarded the Castellani gem in the British Museum (Walters (1926) no. 1374, pl. XIX) as close in type to the images on the coins in group 4 and, therefore, to be a representation of the Athena 'Promachos'. But this idea is very doubtful. 803 See, for example, London, British Museum Q3261. Lundgreen (1997b) pl. Ha. 804 For example, London, British Museum, Q962. Lundgreen (1997b) pl. IIb.</page><page sequence="309">290 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS arm and an upright spear in her right. She wears a helmet of uncertain type. The lamps are dated from the 1st to the 6th century AD and the type existed all over the Roman Empire.805 The three most striking characteristics of this Athena type are the raised shield, the spear held on the opposite side, and the action of stepping forward. None of these aspects fits in with what is known of the Athena 'Promachos' from the images on the coins of group 1 . Therefore, it must be assumed that the Athena type seen on this group of coins bears no association with the appearance of Pheidias's great bronze. Mathiopoulos includes in her discussion certain representations of Athena in Byzantine and later manuscripts, which are thought by some to illustrate the 'Promachos' displayed in Constantinople, after its removal from the Akropolis of Athens in late antiquity.806 These miniatures, which were used to illustrate texts of ancient literature, may or may not have been inspired by specific statues and they must be treated with caution. For example, the Athena type seen on an 11th century Byzantine manuscript, which was believed by Jenkins to illustrate the Athena 'Promachos', shows an erect figure on top of a very high column. She has a large helmet, a gorgoneion, an upright shield by her left side and an upright lance in her right hand. Her head turns slightly to her right and her right leg is set slightly to that side too. Although bearing some resemblance to the Athena 'Promachos', this figure is surely different in that the right hand is not stretched out, as one sees on the coins of group 1. Furthermore, it seems highly unlikely that the Athena 'Promachos', which was at the very least 7m tall, was ever set on top of such a high column. This point alone makes Jenkins' identification dubious. Turning to sculptures in the round, no secure identifications have yet been made. One statue type which has been associated by several scholars with the great bronze Athena is the Athena Medici (Fig. 16.1). 807 The recognized Pheidian quality of the drapery carving, the monumental size of the statue, and the large number of copies, including two reliefs found in Athens, all point to an important Athenian work by Pheidias.808 And yet scholars continue to disagree about the date, technique, size and iconography of the original of the Athena Medici type, which may or may not prove to be appropriate for the great bronze Athena by Pheidias. This type is discussed in detail in its own chapter. Several scholars agree on the association of the so-called Athena Elgin with the great bronze Athena (Figure 8.5).809 The Athena 'Elgin' is supposed to have come from Attica. 805 Not many of the extant lamps from Athens depict a standing figure of Athena. Pick (1931) gives three examples, two of which come from the Kerameikos. He also refers to some late lamps found at Vari, showing the same bust and a standing Athena figure; for these see Bassett (1903) AJA 7, 338-49, fig. 3 for the bust and pl. XIII. 1 for the standing figure. 806 Mathiopoulos (1968) 9-10; Jenkins (1947) 31-33. Lundgreen (1997b) JHS 117, pl. lie. Linfert (1982) 59-66 believes this image to be the Athena Lemnia.

Ridgway</page><page sequence="310">ATHENA 'PROMACHOS' 29 1 It is a small bronze statuette of a standing Athena, wearing a heavy peplos and a Corinthian helmet. The goddess has one leg set slightly back, but both feet are planted fully on the ground. She carries an owl in her outstretched right hand and the left hand is held down by her side. The position of the fingers indicates that she once held a tubular object, possibly a spear shaft. The type was popular in vase painting, as well as on decree and votive reliefs, and in sculpture in the round. The statuette is dated to the early Classical period because of the pose and the heavy drapery, around 475-450 BC. Such a date would accord well with the great bronze Athena, as would the pose, and the dress, as far as one can judge from the available evidence. In addition, the evidence from the coins in group 1 supports the idea that the goddess held a winged creature in her outstretched hand, and even though the creature cannot be seen clearly enough on these coins to identify it exactly, it could quite plausibly be an owl. Mathiopoulos is in favour of the owl as a suitable attribute for the bronze Athena, for the owl was often used as an attribute of Athena in 6th and early 5th century BC representations of the goddess.810 Without stronger evidence in favour of the attribution, it is difficult to say more than that it is possible that the Athena 'Elgin' is based on Pheidias's great bronze Athena. If the idea could be proved, then it would be clear that an owl attribute was part of the 'Promachos' iconography, as well as a Corinthian helmet, but this conclusion is still no more than a tentative suggestion. In conclusion, Roman coins from the 2nd-3rd century AD depicting the Akropolis, provide a general idea of the outdoor setting of the statue on the Akropolis, which is consistent with the indications given by Pausanias as well as the remains of the foundations of the statue base. The coins also provide a rough idea of the colossal size and general outline of the type. This statue was a standing Athena wearing a helmet and peplos. One leg was relaxed and set slightly back. One arm was held forward, the hand carrying an attribute with wings, while on the opposite side her spear stood leaning against her shoulder while the upright shield was set up against her leg. There are obvious similarities with the Parthenos, but how great these were in reality is very difficult to say. Perhaps the more famous Parthenos has left greater echoes. Perhaps it was simply the colossal size of the bronze Athena which discouraged copying. If one considers other colossi such as the Zeus at Olympia or the Athena Parthenos, one finds that either parts of the statues were copied, like elements of the throne of Zeus, or the shield and base of the Athena Parthenos, or versions of the whole were made rather than exact replicas. It is natural that Athens should choose the image of Athena as its symbol on coins and lamps, but an attempt to link all the images with particular statue types is probably bound to fail. (1981) 169 and Demargne (1984) LIMC II, 'Athena' no. 205 both argue that the statuette may echo the ' Promachos ' 810 Mathiopoulos (1968) 25-29.</page><page sequence="311">292 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 8.5.

The bronze has a dark green patina. The left foot is bent. The spear and the helmet crest are broken off. The figure is mounted wrongly so that it leans too far back. The statuette was at one time in the collection of the seventh earl of Elgin (1766-1841) but it did not go with the marbles to the British Museum in 1816. It remained in the possession of the family at Broomhall, near Dumfermline, where it was seen in 1889 by a travelling archaeologist who published a drawing of it. It was loaned to the British Museum in 1933-1934 and was published by Neugebauer shortly afterwards. The statuette portrays Athena wearing a peplos, belted at the waist, with overfold and apoptygma, and a Corinthian helmet. Athena rests her weight on her left leg, while the right leg is very slightly bent and set forwards. The left arm is held down but away from the body, and the fingers - all except the index - are curled as if to hold some object, now missing. The right arm is raised and carries an owl in the hand. The hair is parted in the middle and borders the face in a thick mass. It is gathered at the neck and hangs down in a short, wide tress. BIBLIOGRAPHY Alexander, C. (1950-1951) IX, 58f. Demargne, P.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE The ancient written sources do not mention a single statue of Eros by a famous master of the middle of the 5th century BC except one by Pheidias. According to a 2nd century AD inscription found at Timgad in Algeria, published by Le Glay, the statue by Pheidias was in Athens and it was the inspiration for a small local version, which was made of ivory.811 The Eros of Timgad was probably a reduced copy or a variation of Pheidias' s work. The fact that the copy was made of ivory gives no indication of the material of the original statue. Ivory would have been a suitable material to use for the copy since this was clearly small: the statue base measured 26cm in height and 9.5cm in diameter. But the same was probably not the case for the original statue, judging from what is known of Pheidias's other recorded works. Athenaios, probably writing in the early 3rd century AD, amusingly reconstructs a conversation between Praxiteles's mistress, Phryne, and one of her stingy lovers: when the lover makes the double-edged compliment that she is Praxiteles's little Aphrodite, she teasingly retorts that he is the Eros of Pheidias.812 In both cases the fame of the sculptor suggests that the comparisons are made in order to allude to the great physical beauty of the person addressed, but the play on the meanings of the names of the artists provides intended criticism of their meanness.813 Unfortunately, this reference reveals nothing about the appearance of the Eros of Pheidias, but it suggests that such a statue existed and that it was famous enough to warrant a mention alongside an Aphrodite by Praxiteles. 9.2. ATTRIBUTIONS There is good reason to believe, along with Hermary, that the type known as the 'Soranzo' Eros is related to the Eros of Pheidias.814 The Soranzo Eros represents a naked young man standing in early Classical pose, with the relaxed left leg set forwards, and both feet firmly on the ground. In an unexpected manner, his head turns to the right and inclines upwards. This movement suggests that the figure formed part of a group composition. An unusual arrangement of the hair gives the god a distinctive look: a thick fringe is bunched over the middle of his forehead, while even thicker locks fall down to the jaw line on each side of 811 Le Glay (1979) 129ff. See section on Inscriptions. 812 Athenaios, Deipn. XIII.585F. 813 See the discussion of the relevant passage in Volume 2, The Sources. 814 Hermary (1986) 861, no. 77, 863, no. 87, 864, no. 98 and 910, no. 694. 297</page><page sequence="317">298 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS his face and descend to his shoulders at the back of the head. A ribbon is tied around the head. The copies of the type in St. Petersburg (Fig. 9.2) and Oxford do not have wings on their backs and for this reason the type was not recognized as Eros in the 19th century. It was sometimes taken as a representation of Iakchos, and considered to be the central figure of a triad with a Demeter of the Cherchel type on its right and a Kore of the Albani type on its left. Such a group was attributed to Praxiteles the Elder.815 Hafner suggested that the type represented Agon.816 The identification as Eros, however, is confirmed both by the presence of dowel holes for wings on the Sparta copy (Fig. 9.1), as well as by the use of the same type, but with the position of the legs reversed, for an Eros on a cup of around 440 BC in Ferrara (Fig. 9. 3). 817 This cup is by an artist of the circle of the painter of Fauvel. In the painting Eros is shown listening to the song of a woman, probably a Muse, and the upturned position of the head seems to signify an attitude of concentration. It is likely that this painting provides the necessary clue for the interpretation of the pose of the Soranzo Eros type. Perhaps the original statue was created to celebrate the inspiration of one or more poets, possibly in the context of a poetical competition. Concerning the date of the Soranzo type, the hairstyle and the anatomy of the figure suggest that it may go back to about 450-445 BC. The Eros represented on a stamnos of around 460 BC has a very similar hairstyle.818 The anatomy of the god is very close to that of the figures on the earliest metopes of the Parthenon, as well as to that of 'Triptolemos' on the Great Eleusinian relief. A terminus ante quem for the statue seems to be provided by the Ferrara vase of around 440 BC. Considering the presence of the type on this vase there seems to be no strong reason to follow Ridgway's suggestion that the type was created in the 1st century BC.819 The comparisons to be drawn between the Soranzo type and Attic vase paintings and sculpture, in particular the sculptures of the Parthenon, suggest that it was the product of an Attic sculptor probably of the Pheidian circle, perhaps by Pheidias himself, working in the early Classical style. That the type was used in Attic vase painting shortly after its creation makes it probable that the work was well known and that it stood in Athens. This accords with what little is known of Pheidias's Eros statue from the Timgad inscription. The style of the anatomy argues in favour of an attribution of the type to the master of the Kassel and Tiber Apollos. The highly original pose suggests that it is the work of a master. The three known sculptural copies of the Soranzo type date from the later 2nd century AD, while the two extant written sources for Pheidias's statue of Eros date from about this time or a little later. If the identification of the Soranzo type with Pheidias's Eros is correct, then an upsurge of interest in this sculpture in the 2nd century AD would be explicable in terms of the tastes and interests of the times. Classical Greek representations of love deities won new popularity at this period.

In this period there was a new appreciation for works of art of Severe style and it became very fashionable to have copies of such works as the Diskobolos of Myron, the Aspasia-Sosandra of the Baiae type, and the Omphalos- Choiseul Gouffier Apollo.820 Because of a similarity with the head of Eros as represented on the east frieze of the Parthenon (figure E.VI.42), another type of Eros head has also be associated with Pheidias. This is the head of a hermaic winged bust of Eros carved on a cameo of Augustan date.821 As on the Parthenon frieze representation, the god's hair is bound with a taenia and he has orderly waves of hair on the crown of his head with thicker locks below. Several other heads which closely resemble that of the Berlin cameo have been found.822 That these works were inspired by the Eros of the Parthenon seems possible. And yet here are several reasons for thinking that the inspiration came second-hand, via a classicizing herm made in Rome, rather than directly. For one thing, these heads have Roman or, at any rate, western provenances. Secondly, several of the heads come from herms and, even those which do not, maintain the same, strictly frontal pose. The Berlin cameo specifically includes the hermaic stand for the head, with the identifying wings sprouting from the back. There are also clear differences in the treatment of the hair between the 5th century BC relief depiction and the Roman heads of Eros. The arrangement of the hair on the Eros of the Parthenon frieze is simple and natural. The long, soft locks around the forehead and temples are bound up in the taenia and held in place by it. The lower halves of the ears are distinctly visible. In the Roman versions of the head, the taenia has more of a decorative function. The short locks beneath the taenia are abundant and they cover the ears completely. The manner of their rendering is very stylized. All these factors seem to point to the conclusion that this type of Eros head originated in a Roman Classicizing herm head and that it cannot, therefore, be related to a free-standing statue of Eros by Pheidias. 9.3.

WRITTEN EVIDENCE The evidence for a major monument at Delphi, which was adorned with statues made by Pheidias, comes from Pausanias.823 He records that he saw the monument, which was dedicated from the tithes of Marathon, below the 'Wooden Horse', a bronze sculpture by Antiphanes of Argos, which stood very near the sanctuary entrance on the left side of the Sacred Way (Fig. 10.1). The monument consisted of an inscribed base carrying sixteen statues. Thirteen of the statues were by Pheidias, and they represented Athena, Apollo and Miltiades along with ten Attic heroes. Seven of the heroes were the eponymous heroes of the tribes and the other three were Kodros, Theseus and Philaios. The last three figures of the monument were of Hellenistic date and they represented Antigonos, Demetrios and Ptolemy. Considering the date of the battle of Marathon, some scholars ruled out Pheidias as the sculptor of the Marathon monument, thinking this must be an error on the part of Pausanias.824 The sculptor's name has not been found on any inscription in the 'Perserschutz', to be dated before 480 BC, and there is no evidence that his career started so early. But the fact that Miltiades died in disgrace a couple of years after the battle of Marathon suggests that the monument Pausanias described was erected considerably later than 490 BC and it is now widely believed that the monument was not erected until Kimon, Miltiades's son, held sway. Kimon was active in the 470s-60s BC, becoming most powerful after the victory of Eurymedon, in 469 BC, until he was ostracized in 461 BC. He was officially recalled to Athens in 457 BC825 and he died in 449 BC. A post- Kimonian date for the composition is surely to be excluded, given that Miltiades, Kimon's father, and Philaios, the forefather of Kimon's family, were both included in the monument. The most probable period for the construction of the monument is, therefore, either during the 460s BC or during the later part of the 450s BC. Scholars remain divided in their opinion over which of the two periods is more likely. The later date, which is more widely accepted, would certainly be closer to Pheidias 's floruit , as given by Pliny, of 448^45 BC.826 By this time, the artist would have been well established and ready to receive so important a commission. Nevertheless, a growing number of scholars consider that the earlier date is preferable both in terms of the nature of the monument and in terms of the artist's career. Pausanias does not specify the material of the group but, most 823 Pausanias, X.l 0.1-2. 824 Furtwängler (1893) 55. 825 Concerning the date of Kimon's return to Athens, see Schubert (1994) 37 n. 81. 826 Pliny, 36.15. In favour of the later date are Kluwe (1965) 25, Kron (1976) 217f. and Giuliano (1981). 303</page><page sequence="322">304 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS probably, the figures were hollow cast bronzes. Such groups were very popular in the Early Classical period and Harrison argues that similarities with the two Tarentine dedications at Delphi, made by Hageladas and Onatas, suggest that Pheidias may have been influenced by these dedications and he may even have worked on them himself.827 If this is correct, then it is tempting to conclude that Pheidias learnt much of the technique of bronze casting while he worked in Delphi and that it was as a result of the success of this work that he was able, in around 460 BC, to secure the prestigious commission for the great bronze Athena in Athens. Harrison is of the opinion that the Marathon monument, which tries to raise Miltiades to the status of a hero and displays unabashed pride in the Greek victories against the Persians, is much more in keeping with the period just after Eurymedon than with the rise of radical democracy in Athens.828 Some have tried to argue that the monument was a private dedication, not a public one.829 If this were the case, then the political climate of the time would have less significance. But it seems unlikely that this is possible given Pausanias's insistence that the monument was a tithe of Marathon. The monument was more probably an official Athenian dedication, perhaps made on the initiative of Kimon but sanctioned and approved by the Boule.830 After Eurymedon, Kimon would have been at the height of his popularity and the considerable war booty would have meant that financial considerations were not a problem. Furthermore, Miltiades' s great enemy Themistokles was in exile, and Kimon would have been unopposed in his wish to rehabilitate his father's reputation by honouring Miltiades's victory at Marathon and, in so doing, drawing attention to his own victories. Pausanias says that the group comprised statues of Athena, Apollo and Miltiades, seven eponymous heroes, Erechtheus, Kekrops, Pandion, Leos, Antiochos, Aigeus and Akamas, and three other Attic heroes, who were not yet eponymous, Kodros, Theseus and Philaios. Pausanias then adds three more names, Antigonos, Demetrios and Ptolemy, figures who became eponymous heroes when the tribes were augmented in the Hellenistic period. These last three figures were clearly honoured a long time after the monument was first set up. Thus the original group was composed of two gods, one human and ten heroes. As Knauer observes, the monument would have been "the first large-scale representation of the Tribal Heroes ever".831 Athena's presence was appropriate in her role as the patron goddess of Athens as well as the protecting deity of Miltiades and the Athenians at Marathon. Apollo was the god of the sanctuary, and it was to him that the monument was offered. There may also have been political overtones in the choice of gods represented, for while Athena represented the city of Athens, Apollo represented the Delian League, both of which were headed by Kimon in the 460s BC. The presence of the human, Miltiades, set amongst gods and heroes, is striking and unusual. He was the only human in the group and even 827 Harrison (1996) 23-25. Hageladas is sometimes referred to as a teacher of Pheidias in the sources. See Tzetzes, Chil. VII.921-28; VIII.3 17-32. 828 Harrison (1996) 26. 829 D. Kluwe (1965) 23f.; E. Kluwe (1968) 679ff. 830 Considering the nature of the dedication, see further Kron (1976) 218, Kebric (1983), Höcker/Schneider (1993) 39-50, and Krumeich (1997) 95-96. 831 Knauer (1992) 384 n. 32.</page><page sequence="323">MARATHON MONUMENT 305 the commander-in-chief at Marathon was not included.832 The explanation for this is surely to be found in the fact that the driving force behind the erection of the monument came from Kimon, who was intent on promoting his father's reputation.833 Krumeich draws attention to the Phokian monument at Delphi which indicates that there was a precedent for a statue group including men, as well as heroes and gods.834 The Phokian Monument, which probably dates from around 500-490 BC, showed Apollo with Phokian heroes as well as the seer Tellias and some strategoi. The painting of the battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile at Athens provides another example of gods, men and heroes all shown together. The building was originally called the Stoa Peisianakteios, after its founder, Peisianax, who is thought to have been the brother of Isodike and the brother-in- law of Kimon. The stoa is thought to date from around 460-450 BC and the paintings, which are variously attributed in the sources to Polygnotos, Mikon and sometimes also Panainos, are thought to have been completed shortly afterwards.835 Miltiades is said to have figured amongst the humans portrayed in the famous painting of the battle of Marathon. Leaving aside the later additions, Pausanias's list of heroes is odd for two reasons: the heroes are not listed in the traditional order and only seven out of the ten eponymous heroes are mentioned. The three eponymous heroes missing from the list are Oineus, Hippothoon and Aias. Why all ten eponymous Attic heroes were not included, as they were for instance in the 4th century BC monument in the Athenian Agora, is puzzling.836 Several theories have been advanced in order to explain these anomalies, and all of them are more or less closely related to Mommsen's suggestions.837 He considered that the order of the eponymous heroes in the Marathon monument reflected the battle-order at Marathon, an order determined by lot. The three tribe heroes not mentioned by Pausanias represented the tribes positioned on the victorious right flank. This fact makes their absence from the monument even more unexpected. According to Mommsen, Oineus was represented by Miltiades, stratēģos of Oineis, and his ancestor Philaios, while the foreigners Aias and Hippothoon were replaced by real Attic patriots: Theseus and Kodros. Kron thought it unlikely that the heroes of the tribes on the victorious flank would have been omitted from the monument and she believes that originally all ten Phyle-heroes were 832 The polemarch Kallimachos, who was killed in action in the battle, was represented in the depiction of the battle in the Stoa Poikile. See Pausanias, 1.15.3. 833 One interpretation which is surely very improbable is that of Stähler (1991) 191 ff., who relates the whole group to a different Miltiades, namely Miltiades 'the Elder', uncle of the victorious Miltiades who fought at Marathon. This man, who was of Athenian extraction, became ruler of the Thracian Chersonnese. Stähler suggests that the monument is a celebration of the Attic presence in Thrace. He thinks that Pausanias was simply mistaken in connecting the monument with the victory at Marathon. 834 Krumeich (1997) 101. See Pausanias, X. 1.4-10. 835 Krumeich (1997) 102-09. 836 See Vidal-Naquet (1981) 381-407, for a discussion. 83' Mommsen (1888) 449ff.</page><page sequence="324">306 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS properly represented.838 One possible explanation for their apparent absence is that when the Hellenistic Phyle-eponymoi were added the existing statues were left in place but the names alone were changed in the inscription.839 And yet, there are no examples of such metonomy before the Roman period. Another possibility, which is perhaps more likely, is that three of the heroes went missing over time and these were later replaced by new statues. The reason for such a loss could be the earthquake in the early 4th century BC. The suggestion that Theseus, Kodros and Philaios were included instead of Oineus, Aiax and Hippothoon because changes were made in the list before it became canonical goes against the evidence from the sources, which seems to show that the list of the ten eponymoi was canonical from the beginning.840 The ten phylai were created in around 508/507 BC by Kleisthenes. The inclusion of Philaios, Kodros and Theseus in the monument strengthens the view that the monument was strongly influenced by Kimon. Philaios was the mythical forefather of Kimon's family, the Philaids.841 Kodros, who was renowned for saving his country from a Dorian invasion while he was king, was worshipped as a hero in Athens and his sons were said to have led the colonization of Ionia from Athens. He could also be seen, therefore, as the legendary ancestor of many of the Ionian cities in the Delian Confederacy.842 The famous Athenian hero Theseus, whose father, Aigeus, and son, Akamas, were both included in the monument, was of special importance to Kimon, for it was Kimon who brought the bones of the hero back from Skyros and established his cult in Athens.843 Knauer suspects that Kimon even intended the statue of Theseus to represent himself.844 No traces of an appropriate base for Pheidias's Marathon monument have been found in the location specified by Pausanias. This has led to speculation about the identification of Pheidias's base with other bases found in or near the sanctuary at Delphi. Some of these theories are very tentative and they have won little support among scholars. Bousquet's base for a group of under life-size bronze statues is a case in point.845 Another is Vatin's 838 Kron (1976) 215ff. 839 Kron (1976) 224-25. The representations of the Hellenistic Phylai must be dated as follows: the Phylai Antigonis and Demetrias in the late 4th century BC and Ptolemais in the 3rd century BC. 840 Aristotle, Ath.

The inscription suggests that this</page><page sequence="325">MARATHON MONUMENT 307 base, found to the north-west of the sanctuary in the grounds of the Ecole française at Delphi.846 Most hotly debated is the association of Pheidias's base with the base still standing on the south side of the Treasury of the Athenians. Beneath the long south side of the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi is a triangular terrace, made of tufa surrounded by grey limestone, and originally paved. On it is a long limestone base, composed of two steps, the upper of which bears an inscription, which is written in Archaizing letters: 'AGevatoi t[ô]l' AttóX'ov[i cittò Mé8]ov àicpoGívia tês Mapa0[ô]vi |i[áxeç]847 The Athenians to Apollo, after their victory over the Medes as first fruits of the booty of the Battle of Marathon. The dedication was originally made in smaller letters that were closer together. These letters were effaced later on, to be replaced by larger ones - bearing the same words - at the time when the whole monument was elongated (Fig. 10.2). The later letters are thought to be no earlier than the 3rd century BC. The only legible letters which are characteristic of the earlier dedication are the E, with three horizontal bars, of which the middle one is slightly shorter than the other two, and the 0 , inscribed as a central dot within the outer circle. These letters indicate a date of around 480-460 BC for the original dedication, if not slightly earlier. In its first state the base was rectilinear. When it was altered, the four blocks on the left hand side of the base, and possibly the fifth which is now lost, were left unchanged, but all the other blocks were moved. Some of these were reçut and so shortened, and none of them were reattached. In addition, a block was inserted in the middle of the base and two blocks were added at the east end. In its second state the base was no longer straight, but bent at an angle on the right side.848 Pausanias mentions no base beneath the Treasury of the Athenians, and yet one has been found there. Not only was it used for a multi-figure sculpture group of about the same size as the one Pausanias describes, but it bears an inscription which connects it with the battle of Marathon and which shows that the monument was altered and elongated in the 3rd century BC. This series of coincidences makes it tempting to believe, along with J. P. Barron, that this is the very base Pausanias saw at the sanctuary entrance in the later part of the 2nd century AD, a base which he believes was later moved to its present location.849 was an Athenian offering, but it cannot be related to Pheidias's Marathon monument with any certainty. For further discussion see Kron (1976) 215 n. 1037. 846 Vatin (1991) 165ff. An extension started for the Ecole française revealed the remains of a house of the early Christian period, comprising a paved courtyard and surrounding wall built out of stones brought from the Delphic sanctuary. According to Vatin, several blocks date from the 5th century BC and they appear to come from one source, for they were all worked in similar fashion. Vatin maintains that there are no signs that this monument was ever altered or that statues were moved in antiquity, and he has published inscriptions which he claims to have seen on four of the blocks. According to his reconstruction, some of the statues at least were set obliquely to the front, and they were placed in two lines. See Vatin (1991) fig. 61. No photos of the inscriptions are available and other archaeologists have been unable to confirm their presence on the stones in question. The validity of the claims is therefore doubtful. 847 Text : Amandry (1998) 76. 848 Amandry (1998) 75ff. 849 These matters were discussed in conversation with Professor Barron.</page><page sequence="326">308 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Barron finds it unlikely that there would have been two similar monuments in the same vicinity, both altered in later times. He argues that the fact that the cramps attaching the stones at the left end of the monument have not been tampered with, which Bommelaer takes as proof that the Treasury base has never been moved, only shows that the stones have not been moved since those cramps were put in place. It does not provide evidence that the present cramps were not used after the monument was moved. The cramps are of a sort which continued to be used until late in antiquity and there is no reason to believe that they date from before the 2nd century AD. He also believes that there is evidence that the Treasury base was not intended to stand in its present location. If the monument had been intended to stand in this position, then surely the stones would have been neatly fitted together when the base was lengthened. Bommelaer is firmly opposed to the identification of the Treasury base with Pheidias's base and he believes that the hypothesis of a removal of the base lacks valid arguments.850 Vatin agrees that the Treasury base and Pheidias's base were quite different, but he suggests that there are traces of inscriptions on the Treasury base which show that some of the alterations made to this monument were carried out by Pheidias at the same period as he was working on his Marathon Monument. His publication of the inscriptions includes detailed transcriptions but no photos of the stones in question.851 The upper surface of the stones of the Treasury base is extremely pitted and there is no independent confirmation of the presence of the inscriptions reported by Vatin. It therefore remains unsafe to draw any new conclusions based on Vatin's claims, and one can only note his opinions. Amandry agrees that the coincidental similarities between the base Pausanias describes and the Treasury base provide no proof of identity. He does not find it improbable that there should have been two monuments at Delphi celebrating Marathon with groups of statues of Athenian heroes. A careful investigation of the foundations of the Treasury of the Athenians and the base of the monument on the Treasury terrace has revealed that the two are contemporary. The blocks at the back of the lower step of the base rest directly upon the one course of Treasury foundation blocks which is not flush with the other courses but protrudes by between 15-30cm along its entire length on the south side.852 Amandry suggests that aesthetic considerations may well have prompted the decision to break the monotony of the bare south foundation wall by adding a terrace upon which a statue group could be erected. The south side of the Treasury was the first to be seen by approaching visitors, and the terrace succeeds in masking a good proportion of the foundations, of which the depth was essential because of the slope of the terrain. Amandry does not believe that the dedication set upon the terrace was necessarily connected with the Treasury. He speculates that by the time Pausanias came to Delphi any statues that once stood on the Treasury base had been removed, which would explain Pausanias 's silence about any dedication in this location. As to the connection of the Treasury of the Athenians with 850 Bommelaer (1991) 111. 851 Vatin (1991). As Barron said, the onus is on Vatin to provide evidence to support his claims. When Vatin came to London in 1985 for the Riace bronzes conference, he had with him one squeeze, which Barron examined and which he thought looked genuine. But when Barron later looked at his own photo of the stone in question, he could find no trace of the signature of Pheidias which the squeeze appeared to show. 852 Amandry (1998) 87ff„ fig. 7.</page><page sequence="327">MARATHON MONUMENT 309 Marathon, Amandry thinks it probable that Pausanias gleaned the information from guides rather than from any inscription.853 10.2. ATTRIBUTIONS Given how little information is available concerning the Marathon Monument at Delphi, and the lack of any firm archaeological evidence, it seems highly doubtful that any attributions can be made with much confidence.854 It is probably correct to assume that the group was made of bronze, given its authorship, setting and approximate date, but even this information is lacking from Pausanias 's brief description. One might expect Miltiades and several of the heroes to be shown wearing a helmet and carrying weapons. And Harrison's suggestion that Miltiades was represented on a smaller scale than the gods seems plausible.855 It is possible that Pausanias listed the figures in the order in which they appeared on the base: the gods first, then Miltiades, then the heroes. But equally Pausanias may have named the most important figures first, and one could imagine that the gods and Miltiades were placed centrally, with the eponymous heroes standing either side.856 At any rate, Miltiades is named immediately after the gods, so these three figures may well have stood together. Many attributions have been suggested for this statue group, usually on the basis that a certain type is generally attributed to Pheidias or that a statue resembles one of these types.857 But many of the suggestions are unconvincing as the works are probably too late in date to be acceptable. Attempts have been made, notably by Fuchs and later by Giuliano, to associate the Tiber Apollo with the Apollo of the Marathon group of Pheidias at Delphi (Fig. 14.2). 858 As pointed out by Barron, the feet of the Apollo Tiber would fit perfectly into some of the holes left in the statue base on the south side of the Treasury of the Athenians, which he suspects is Pheidias's base. Kron, however, rules the Tiber Apollo out as part of this group on the grounds that his posture and bent head cannot have been directed at another statue in the group, since he is obviously engrossed in the object held in his left hand.859 This suggests that the Tiber Apollo was not intended to stand in a group but was a self- sufficient figure. Another difficulty with regard to the Tiber Apollo is that, despite the type's similarities with other works possibly related to Pheidias - such as the Dresden/Bologna Athena and the female head in Brescia - there is still much disagreement 853 Amandry (1998) 89-90.

He rests on his right leg, with the left relaxed and the soles of both feet set fully on the ground. The shoulders are level and the head is turned to his right. The hair can be seen as two rows of curls below the helmet. The helmet is Corinthian with a high crest. The arms are both held out from the body and they are slightly bent, the left holding a round shield. The lower edge of the shield rests on the tree-trunk support to the left of the statue. The identification of this piece with the Theseus of the Marathon monument at Delphi has been rejected by all other scholars since Berger because the copies of this type are ambiguous in their relation to the original. Some of the replicas show Hermes rather than a warrior. This is the case with the pendant statue from Tivoli, for instance, which is of exactly the same type as the warrior but with attributes identifying it as Hermes. The round shield and the crest which identify the statue in question as a warrior cannot even be traced back to Classical types. Perhaps one is here dealing with alterations made by the Roman copyist, as may be the case with the wounded thigh of the Mattei Amazon also from the Villa at Tivoli, for example. The problem with Berger's identification is that it rests on the assumption that the shield and the helmet reflect the original of the type. But since this is so uncertain the statue type should probably be rejected as a representation of Pheidias's Theseus. A female head in Brescia was considered by Furtwängler to represent Athena, and as such it has been associated by some with the Marathon monument.862 This head, however, has been shown to be a modified version of the so-called 'Sappho' type, so it cannot be relevant to this monument.863 The Dresden/Bologna Athena (Fig. 5.1), usually associated with the Athena Lemņia, has also been attributed to the monument, as Boardman mentions, but the date of this statue type is surely too late.864 A glass paste in Heidelberg, showing a bearded male head bearing the inscription KOAPOZ BAZIAEYZ on the taenia, has been associated with the statue of Kodros by Pheidias (Fig. 10. 3). 865 The oval, deep violet glass paste is adorned with the bust of the 860 Zanker (1974) 91-92. 861 Tivoli, Hadrian's Villa, Museum, 2262.

The features are those of a mature person, with a broad forehead, deepset eyes, slightly hollow cheeks and a fold of looser skin running from the nose to the moustache. His right shoulder with the fastened chiton is visible too. The glass gem is dated to the late Roman Republican period and thought by Hampe to be based on a sculptural model dating from around 440 BC.866 The gem is compared quite convincingly with various other gems and coins connected with Pheidias, for instance,, with coins showing the head of the Pheidian Zeus statue at Olympia, dated in the 430s BC. The identification is based on the inscription on the head band. According to Giuliano, the Kodros glass gem was created in the 1st century BC, inspired by the statue in Delphi, probably after the sack of Delphi by the Gauls in 279 BC.867 Two statues which have been much argued over in connection with the Marathon Monument are the Riace bronzes (Figs. 19.1-5).868 Riace A has been identified as Kodros or Leos, while Riace B has been identified as Philaios or Miltiades.869 There is as yet no proof that the Riace bronzes can be connected with the Marathon Monument or indeed Delphi. Like many of the pieces mentioned so far, their probable date might well make them too late for the Marathon Monument. A herm in Ravenna, which bears an inscription, reveals an ancient image of Miltiades.870 Richter and Smith regard this head as "an accurate - though of course generalized - likeness, not a purely invented one."871 It is possible that it follows one of 866 Hampe (1971) no. 147. 867 Giuliano (1984a). 868 See chapter 19, cat nos.

Similarities between Riace A and the Heidelberg glass paste, in particular in the hair, beard and head band, have been pointed out by Fuchs (1982) 35-36. He regards Riace A as more heroic than Riace B and, therefore, an apt representation of a Phyle hero. How close these similarities are is difficult to assess. It is possible that Riace A originally wore a helmet, for instance, and that the so-called head band is merely a supporting surface for the helmet. Giuliano (1984a) 297ff. identified Riace A as Leos, mainly on the basis of the leonine nature of the hair and beard of the statue; the lion was the heraldic aspect for the tribe. Fuchs (1982) 34ff. has attempted to identify statue B as Philaios, the hero of thé family of Miltiades and Kimon. Such an attribution implies a rejection of the distinction made by Busignani (1981) 106-10 between the 'hero', statue A, and the 'stratēģos', statue B, a distinction which is not implausible. 870 Ravenna, Museo Nazionale. Herm of Miltiades. H. 0.68m; H. of head, 0.33m. Marble. From Rome, Caelian Hill. 2nd century AD. The herm portrays the head of a bearded man with full features. The beard is heavy and the hair is thick and curly. The forehead is broad with a furrow which makes the area over the brow seem swollen. The eyes are placed quite close together and they are large with heavy lids. The nose, which has been reattached, is large and slightly pointed.

Stylistic and iconographical similarities with Attic grave reliefs of the mid 4th century BC suggest a 4th century BC date for the original.873 Furthermore, the Ravenna herm type is shown wearing a himation. Thus Miltiades is characterized as a citizen and a statesman. But the Miltiades at Delphi was being honoured as a general, making it much more likely that he would have been represented wearing a helmet. A foot, still on its base with the inscription Pandion, was found in Rome in the garden of San Lorenzo di Panisperna. It is now in the storeroom of the Capitoline Museum. Kron compared it convincingly with three early Classical works: the Delphi charioteer, the Artemision Zeus, and Aristogeiton.874 This, combined with the inscription, suggests that it is a copy of one of two works: either the Pandion statue from the Marathon Monument at Delphi or a Pandion statue on the Athenian Akropolis. It is possible that it comes from a copy of the statue in Delphi but there is no secure evidence to support such a conclusion.875 Its fragmentary nature means that, in any case, it adds little to the discussion. Perhaps more promising, though still but a tentative hypothesis, is the identification, made by Despinis and Harrison, of three Roman heads as copies of Early Classical Greek bronzes representing Miltiades, Athena and Apollo, which may reflect the lost monument at Delphi.876 The three heads were all found in Athens and their poor state of preservation is in part due to the fact that they were reçut for use as building material in walls. They are all made of Thasian marble and they show similar workmanship. The flesh surfaces are polished, the inner corner of each eye is separated from the eyeball by a sharp line and the heads identified as Athena and Miltiades were both cut in a similar manner for the 872 The literary sources mention at least four different representations of Miltiades: a statue in the Prytaneion in Athens together with one of Themistokles; another statue in the theatre of Dionysos in Athens, again with one of Themistokles; a painting of Miltiades in the depiction of the battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile in Athens; and, finally, the statue in Delphi mentioned by Pausanias. See Pausanias 1.18.3; scholiast of the rhetorician Aristides; Pliny, NH. 35.57; Pausanias, X. 10. 1-2 873 Gauer (1968b) 128-32; Krumeich (1997) 98 and n. 377; see also Despinis (2001) 110.

It is well preserved, except for the tip of the big toe which is chipped. The fragment, which was reused as building material, was found along with a number of other sculptures in a place which may have been used as a kind of 'Mouseion'. The right foot is set fully on the ground, and there is no sign of drapery or sandal. The three middle toes are straight and held together. The little toe, which is very short, curls in towards the other toes. The big toe is separate from its neighbour. The nails are cut square.

Most of the proper left side of the female head, Akropolis 2338, is cut away and the top of the head, which bore the helmet, is missing too. The identification as Athena is based on the long wavy hair, which can be seen on the side of the head and going down the neck, as well as the remains of a flap of leather depicted over the right temple. This was part of the leather lining worn beneath a Corinthian helmet.879 The Athena head is on a similar scale to that of the Apollo head and both are somewhat larger in scale than the bearded male head, Akropolis 2344, identified by Despinis as Miltiades.880 This is the least damaged of the three heads. The Early Classical hairstyle, with braids crossing at the back of the neck and little curls below, all worked with remarkable care, contrasts with the Roman treatment of the eyes, which can be seen in the incised iris and bored pupil. Despinis suggests that the head is an early Antonine copy of a bronze original, perhaps dating from around 470-^60 BC.881 The top of the head is cut away in a manner similar to the female head, no. 2338. This fact, along with signs of the leather helmet lining over the ears, shows that this head too once bore a Corinthian helmet. Given the similarities between these three pieces, in provenance, material, technique and style, and the fact that the two gods are just slightly bigger than the man, it seems more than probable that they issued from the same workshop and once stood together in the same group. Where they originally stood in Athens is not known, but it is possible that they were on the Akropolis.882 Harrison suggests that the distinctive nature of Thasian marble means that more fragments might yet be recognized. Whether or not these statues were copied from Pheidias's monument at Delphi is not yet known. If they were, as Despinis suspects, then it is possible that other members of the same group were copied too. The hairstyle of the Athena head, with wavy strands coming down on either side of the face and going down towards the back of the neck suggested to Despinis that this head type might belong with the torso of Athena in Madrid.883 And indeed, the headless Roman statue of the 2nd century AD has a thick and wavy braid of hair descending from the nape in a manner which would suit the Athenian head. It has long been thought that the Madrid torso, of which no other copy has yet been found, reflects a major work of the Early Classical period.

The sharp folds of the chiton and apoptygma, the aegis with plastically rendered snakes and the very defined waves of hair all point to a bronze original, which Despinis dates in the last years of the decade 470-460 BC, like the Athena head, 23 3 8. 884 Despinis argues that the Madrid torso must be a work of Attic provenance because in stance and drapery it follows in the tradition of such works as the small marble Athena, Akropolis 140, dating from around 480 BC, and the early Classical bronze statuette of Athena, Athens, NM 64 54. 885 A link with Pheidias may also be seen in the similarities between the Madrid torso and the drapery of the two figures in the Parthenon metope, N.32. The correct reconstruction of the pose of the goddess is central to the interpretation of the statue. While the left arm is lowered and bent at the elbow, with the forearm brought forwards, the right arm, most of which is lost, was clearly raised high in such a position that Athena's upper body leans slightly towards the left. Such a pose is clearly not that of a 'Promachos' type, brandishing a lance which is held more or less horizontally in the air.886 Nor is it suitable for the action of simply holding an upright lance which rests on the ground.887 If this were the case, the body would not lean to the left as it does. Despinis suggests that Athena probably held a shield and upright lance on her left side, while the right arm was raised in the act of crowning Miltiades.888 A notable parallel for such a crowning could have been seen on the nearby Lysander Monument at Delphi.889 Poseidon was there shown crowning the Spartan general, Lysander (Pausanias, X.9.7), who won a decisive victory over the Athenians at Aigospotamoi in 405 BC. The positioning of the Lysander Monument, so that it partially hid from view the famous Athenian dedication, and the scale of the monument, in which Pausanias counted no less than thirty-seven statues, suggest that the Spartans deliberately intended to put the Marathon Monument in the shade. If so, it is possible that they also deliberately sought to echo the monument by imitating the crowning motif, for instance, in order to heighten the comparison. 884 Despinis (2001) 119. 885 See Despinis (2001) 115 and nn. 58 and 60 concerning these two works. 886 Fuchs (1969) 188.

CATALOGUE MADRID ATHENA TORSO (Fig. 4.1) Madrid, El Prado Museum, E-24. Torso. H. 1.86m. Marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. The torso, which was previously in the Odescalchi Collection, has been mended from three fragments. Missing are the head and part of the neck, the end of the hair braid at the back, most of the right arm, the lower left arm, the lower left side of the statue from the waist, the lower right side at the back of the statue, and the ends of the aegis snakes. There is some damage to the drapery. This headless torso of Athena is of a type of which no other replica has yet been found, though one may compare an analogous bronze statuette.890 The goddess stands with both feet resting firmly on the ground, the right foot set forwards a little. The feet are bare. The right knee is very slightly bent. The right arm, of which only the shoulder and upper arm remain, was raised right up, above shoulder height (much higher than on, say, the Angelitos Athena, Akropolis Museum, 140, or the Dresden torso, Dresden, 40), while the left upper arm was held down, with the elbow bent and the lower arm extended forwards. The movement of the right arm means that the torso leans very slightly to the left. Athena wears a chiton and peplos. The delicate and thin folds of the chiton are visible on the left upper arm and hanging down from the elbow, on the right upper side, and around the feet, where it falls down to the ground below the peplos. The peplos hangs in much heavier folds, which are fewer in number. On the lower body folds mask the left leg completely, while the right leg is lightly distinguished through the folds at the front. On the upper body a short overfold covers the torso to just below the waist line and its relatively flat appearance in the central part of the torso is contrasted with the more complex arrangement of folds hanging symmetrically on either side. A thick and heavy-looking aegis, through which are modelled the breasts, falls over the chest and shoulders at the front and right down to the top of the thighs at the back. Its oval contour is adorned with a scalloped edge formed by the bodies of snakes, most of which have lost their twisting heads and tails. At the front, but not at the back, the aegis is covered in a scale pattern, but there is no sign of a gorgoneion. On the nape can be seen the remains of a thick bunch of wavy locks. The back of the statue is not finished in detail and its design, with the very flat aegis and few folds on the lower peplos, is very dull. BIBLIOGRAPHY Blanco. A. (1959) 24E, pls. 6-7. Boardman, J.

ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 11.1. INTRODUCTION Pheidias went to Olympia some time after 438 BC to work on the colossal statue of Zeus which had been commissioned from him by the people of Elis for the temple of Zeus at Olympia. This work, which proved to be his greatest masterpiece, must have occupied Pheidias for several years. It was generally considered the embodiment of the Homeric idea of Zeus. It came to be counted as one of the wonders of the world. From what one can gather about the appearance of the statue, it represented the culmination of Pheidias 's work, the perfection of the chryselephantine colossus, with all its rich adornments. It was a work which invited comparison with the Athena Parthenos in Athens. The authorities at Olympia were clearly impressed by Pheidias 's Athenian masterpiece and determined to have a work which could rival it. The size of the Zeus was impressive. From Kallimachos, Iambi VI, frg. 196, one can infer that the statue and its base measured 27 cubits, that is to say approximately 12.3m high, on a base of just under lm high, which was 20 'feet' wide and which occupied one third of the space within the interior colonnade of the naos. Thus the Zeus would have been 1 cubit higher than the Athena Parthenos and about lm below the level of the naos ceiling (Fig. 11.1). Not surprisingly, several sources suggest that the temple appeared inadequate once it housed the great Zeus. For, as Strabo observes, in Geogr. 8.3.30, the seated Zeus gave the impression that he would go through the roof if he ever tried to stand up. The Athena Parthenos and the great bronze Athena on the Akropolis show that Pheidias had a great sense of space and setting, and that his works were created with a view to where they were intended to stand. In the case of the Athena Parthenos, it seems clear that certain features of the design of the temple were dictated by the needs of the statue which stood within it. But at Olympia the temple which was to house the Zeus had already been standing for a good twenty years when Pheidias started work on his masterpiece. The decision to represent Zeus seated and the resultant disproportion between the temple and its divine image remain difficult to explain. Although shocking, as much to the ancient viewer as to us, this disproportion seems to have increased the impact of Pheidias 's statue on those who saw it. The Doric temple of Zeus at Olympia was erected in the period 472-457 BC. According to Pausanias (V.10.3), it was the work of a local architect named Libon, Aißwv émxwpioç.891 It was very conventional both in form and plan. It was built of local 891 That Libon was a local architect, rather than perhaps an architect from elsewhere who was honoured with citizenship by Elis for his work, has been questioned by Herrmann (1987) 121 and Patay-Horváth (2004) 27-28. Patay-Horváth comments that there was no tradition for architecture in Elis and it is doubtful that a prospective architect could have received training there. An interesting point to bear in mind is that the temple of Zeus at Olympia bears close 319</page><page sequence="338">320 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS limestone, which is distinctive because of the many shells embedded in the stone, and then covered in stucco. The tiles, gutters and sculptural decoration were made of Parian marble. The temple measured 27.68m by 64.12m and its pteron consisted of six by thirteen columns. The pedimental sculptures and the metopes, which were placed over the inner porches at each end of the building, are well preserved. Dating from the second quarter of the 5th century BC, they are amongst the finest marble sculptures of the Greek world and they allow one to study the development of Greek sculpture as it passed from the Severe style to the mature Classical style of the next generation. Some of the subjects treated in these works find echoes in the Zeus composition. The twelve metopes showed the labours of Herakles, who was the son of Zeus and the founder of the Olympic Games. Herakles featured again on the painted screens placed around the statue of Zeus: Herakles with Atlas, the fight with the Nemean lion, Herakles about to release the captive Prometheus, as well as two Hesperides. He also figured in the composition on the side bars between the legs of the throne of Zeus, where Herakles, with Theseus as ally, was shown fighting against the Amazons. The west pediment represents a violent Centauromachy, probably with Peirithous, the Lapith king, reputedly a son of Zeus, and his friend Theseus as the leading fighters.892 Noteworthy is the fact that this is the first known sculptural representation of the new version of the Centauromachy, which first became popular from the 470s BC in Athens, where it was depicted in a mural for the Theseion.893 Before this time the battle against the Centaurs had always been shown as a pitched battle out of doors and, according to the myth, it took place well after the marriage feast of Peirithous. The new representation showed the battle taking place at the wedding feast, with Lapith women being outraged by the violent and uncouth Centaurs. The inspiration from Athens is interesting, as is also the prominence given to Theseus, the emerging hero of the Athenian democracy. In the Zeus composition Theseus was given considerable importance: not only did he feature as the ally of Herakles in his fight against the Amazons, on one of the side bars between the legs of the throne, but he was also shown in his own Athenian Amazonomachy on the front of the footstool. In addition, one of the screen paintings by Panainos showed Theseus and Peirithous. The subject of the east pediment, with its quietly standing central figures, two teams of horses, and various youths and old men sitting and reclining as far as the corners of the pediment, remains mysterious. According to Pausanias (V.10), it represents Pelops and Oinomaos preparing for their famous chariot similarities with the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia. Concerning the latter temple, see Broneer (1971). 892 Pausanias (V.10.8) says that the central figure in the composition is Peirithous, but this is generally thought unlikely given the difference in scale between this figure and the humans about him. Many scholars favour the view that it is Apollo, claiming that fragments of a bow, which the god may have held in his lowered left hand, have been found (see, for instance, Boardman (1985) fig. 19). But Kardara (1978) 102-19 has argued that the evidence that the central figure carried a bow is weak. She identifies the figure as a youthful Zeus Areios on the grounds that there is little evidence for the worship of Apollo at Olympia, that Zeus was regarded as the father of Peirithous, that other images of a youthful Zeus existed in Olympia and elsewhere in western Greece, and that it would be appropriate that Zeus should figure at the centre of both the pediments on his temple. 893 See Barron (1972) 25ff.</page><page sequence="339">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 321 race. He thought the central figure was a statue of Zeus, and he identified Oinomaos and his wife Sterope standing on the right and Pelops and Hippodameia standing on the left. The other figures were, he thought, chariot-drivers and other people connected with looking after the horses, plus personifications of the two rivers of Olympia, the Kladeos and the Alpheios. The story of the chariot race might be appropriate for several reasons: it is a local myth, the chariot race theme fits in well given the importance of the games held in this sanctuary, and the implied victory over Pisa, Oinomaos 's kingdom, fits in with Pausanias's statement (V.10.2) that the temple at Olympia, along with the image of Zeus by Pheidias, was built from the spoils of battle after Elis defeated Pisa.894 Inside the temple, Oinomaos 's daughter, Hippodameia, and her mother, Sterope, were both included on one of the painted screens by Panainos.895 Patay-Horváth, however, has demonstrated that the identifications made on the basis of the information proffered by Pausanias arc doubtful.896 He finds the interpretation of the scene suspicious and he concludes that the information was probably given to Pausanias by local guides who had perhaps inherited a later tradition, after the original meaning of the pediment, which was no longer understood, had been forgotten.897 The interior of the naos measured 13.06m by 28.74m and it was divided into three parts by two colonnades, each one consisting of seven Doric columns with a smaller set superimposed. The central space was twice as wide as the side aisles. Wooden staircases on either side of the entrance doors to the naos led up to galleries above the outer aisles of the naos. Pausanias writes that one of these staircases went right up to the roof. In the naos visitors could not proceed further than the level of the second pair of columns, for a stone 894 Patay-Horváth (2004) 26ff. doubts the veracity of this statement. See notes to Pausanias, V.10.2, in Volume 2. 895 These are discussed in section 4 of this chapter. 896 Patay-Horváth (2004) 2 Iff. There are two major problems in trying to fit the archaeological remains of the east pediment with Pausanias's text. When Pausanias says figures were placed to the right (V.10.6, eoriv Olvójiaoç kv 8e£iâi toi) Aiòç) or the left of the central figure (V.10.7, Ta ôè es àpi&lt;jT€pà qlttò toö Aiòç ó néXoi); Kal ťInTTo8á|ieia), it is not clear whether he means from the viewer's perspective or from that of the central figure. Secondly, the sculptures were found scattered on the ground and it has not been possible to ascertain for certain which of figures F, G, I and K formed the pairs on either side of the central figure. Pausanias records that both the figures before the chariot teams are charioteers, but figure O is definitely female. The reclining, bearded man, figure N, whom Pausanias guesses to be a horse groom, is too old for such a role. The female figure K, who must be either Sterope or Hippodameia, according to Pausanias, has a thick and ragged mop of hair in a style which, in Patay-Horváth 's opinion, is much more suitable for a slave-girl than for a queen or a princess. Both figure G and figure I stand with a raised hand and have a helmet on their head so, when Pausanias says that Oinomaos is the one putting on his helmet, it is impossible to be sure which figure he meant. Figure G originally had a helmet, shield and breastplate, while figure I had a helmet, mantle and lance. Patay-Horváth points out that in vase paintings Pelops is usually represented naked or wearing either a light mantle or a richly decorated Oriental costume, while Oinomaos, king of Pisa, is usually represented with breastplate, helmet, lance and shield. 897 Concerning the problems with Pausanias's statement that both the temple and the statue of Zeus were financed from the spoils taken by Elis after the defeat of Pisa, see the notes to Pausanias, V.10.2, in Volume 2.</page><page sequence="340">322 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS screen with folding gates was placed right across the naos and then between the side columns as far as the fifth column on each side, to the level of the statue base. The base of the statue, of which the outline can still be seen on the naos floor, went from the level of the fifth pair of columns almost to the end of the naos and measured 6.54m by 9.82m.898 Thus the back of the Zeus composition was close to the back wall of the naos. From 167 BC it probably had as its backdrop the great woollen curtain dedicated by Antiochos IV, which Pausanias comments upon in V.12.4, and which may have been the famous veil of the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem. It was Antiochos who had despoiled this temple and renamed it the temple of Olympian Zeus. Pausanias says there was a rim of Parian marble on the black paving stones in front of the Zeus at Olympia, designed to contain the oil that was poured out for the statue.899 The arrangement Pausanias describes has been confirmed by the discovery of a sunken course, 0.12m deep, in front of the statue base in dark Eleusinian limestone, framed by white marble, which the German excavators call Pentelic. Where the rim reached to the interior colonnade, the stones were cut in such a way as to give the illusion of lying beneath the columns, as if the sunken pool were part of the original design rather than an alteration made specially to accommodate Pheidias's ideas. The use of the pool is not known for certain but, as in the case of the water pool in front of the Athena Parthenos, the reflective qualities of the pools must have enhanced the setting of the statues. Boardman suggests that at Olympia the pool was in fact for water, which was necessary to keep the humidity level constant inside the temple, as much for the woodwork of the statue as for its ivory.900 He thinks that perhaps the water pool had become oily by Pausanias's day and that Pausanias's guides gave him a confused account of its use. But oil may have been used to rub the ivory down. Another possibility, as Levi suggests, is that there was a system of tubes within the statue to nourish the wood with oil, which eventually brought the oil out into the pool in front of the statue.901 The conventional layout of the naos, with its two colonnades dividing the internal space into three long sections - which is so different from the form of the Parthenon - suggests that, apart from alterations to the naos floor, Pheidias made his statue for an already existing naos.902 The viewing galleries at the top of the lower columns of the colonnade, were perhaps later additions, created for visitors primarily interested in admiring the famous statue, but the internal staircase which went up to the roof must have been part of the original plan; it would have been needed to provide access to the loft and roof, for maintenance purposes. It has seemed strange to several scholars that the Pheidian image was not in place until over twenty years after the temple was finished. Richter pointed out that this was perhaps not as unusual as it may seem, for the statues of the Hephaisteion at Athens were not set 898 So Mallwitz (1972) 229. 899 Pausanias, V. 11.10. 900 Boardman (1967) 508-09. 901 Levi (1971, 1979 reprint) 230, n. 107. 902 On this matter, see Coulton (1977) 111-15.</page><page sequence="341">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 323 up until twenty-five years after the completion of that building.903 She suggested that during the interval a statue from an earlier sanctuary was probably used, an image which might be reflected on some 5th century BC coins from Elis. Some of the coins in question show a seated figure and others show a bearded head.904 These last coins are dated around 420 BC but they clearly reproduce an earlier type.905 Richter thought that the old image was the one to which Pausanias, V.10.2, is referring when he says that the temple and its image were paid for by the spoils the Eleians won from the Pisans. One part of Richter' s theory which must now be discarded definitely is that the old statue was ruined in the earthquake which damaged some of the reclining figures in the west pediment, as well as the building itself, and it was this disaster which necessitated the creation of a new image in the 430s BC: it has been shown that the earthquake which damaged the pedimental figures occurred a good number of years after the date required by Richter.906 Mallwitz thinks that either there was no image before the Pheidian one or the image was still unfinished at the time when Pheidias came to work in Olympia.907 It seems certain that the temple was built with a view to housing some monumental image of the god from the first, but that this cannot have been Pheidias' s image is clear from the changes that had to be made to the naos before his work could be housed there. In order to honour their god with an image which would outdo even the magnificence of the recently completed Athena Parthenos, perhaps the people of Elis were prepared to wait until Pheidias was free to come and work for them, even if this meant discarding a work already started. Alzinger suggests that Pheidias never intended his colossal work to stand in the existing temple, but that he hoped to convince Elis that, as in Athens, a new temple of more appropriate dimensions would be necessary to house the image. While working for Perikles in Athens, Pheidias would have grown used to unlimited funding. But at Olympia, he would have encountered a very different mentality. The result was that the temple Pheidias hoped for was never built and his image had to be squeezed into the existing, narrow temple as best it could.908 Although it is now generally agreed that the Zeus of Olympia was made in the 430s BC, after the Athena Parthenos, there are still problems concerning the exact date. The iconography of the statue, with at least three references to the Athenian hero Theseus and a reference to the Battle of Salamis, imply tolerance and even friendship with Athens at the time when the statue was made. But, as Höcker and Schneider say, two apparently contradictory factors complicate the dating of the work.909 The pottery finds in the workshop seem to suggest that the workshop was in use from the later 430s BC onwards. At the same time it is known that relations between Athens and Elis worsened steadily 903 Richter (1950) 226. 904 For a seated figure see, for example, Gardner (1887) pl. X. 1 1, and for a bearded head see, for example, Head (1911) 422, fig. 230. 905 See also Furtwängler (1895/1964) 217-18. 906 Ashmole and Yalouris (1972) 21-22. 907 Mallwitz (1972) 229. 908 Alzinger (1997) 13-14. 909 Höcker and Schneider (1993) 98.</page><page sequence="342">324 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS from 435 BC. They suggest that either the dating of the workshop is not as secure as is generally believed and that the statue was in fact made in the earlier part of the decade when the two cities were still on speaking terms, or that the priesthood of Olympia was following a policy which was independent of Elis when they commissioned the work to be made in the later part of the decade. 11.2. THE STATUE OF ZEUS Pausanias says that the god was represented seated on a throne and that he was of gold and ivory. He had an olive branch wreath on his head. He held a staff in his left hand, with an eagle perched on the top, and on his right hand he supported a chryselephantine Nike. His sandals were of gold, as was his cloak, which was elaborately decorated with patterns of animals and flowers. Strabo says that the artist Panainos, who made the painted screens for the composition, also helped Pheidias with the colours for the cloak.910 Ivory was used to render the flesh of face, arms, legs and torso. Lucian says that two locks of the god's hair, each weighing six pounds, were stolen by thieves; this suggests they were probably made of gold.911 The sceptre was decorated with a number of different precious metals. As a contrast to the shining gold and white ivory of the figures, the throne on which Zeus sat was executed in a dark material, perhaps ebony or the dark Eleusinian limestone which was used for the base as well as for the floor in front of the statue. The throne was a masterpiece in itself: it had figures inlaid, painted and sculptured upon it. All sorts of inlays were used: gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory. The stool, on which the feet of the image rested, and the base for the whole statue complex were both adorned with golden figures in relief. Compared with his description of the throne, Pausanias 's few lines on the figure of Zeus are not very detailed. Nevertheless, it is largely due to this source that it was possible to recognize the image of Pheidias 's statue of Zeus on Hadrianic coins of Elis dating from between AD 135-137 (Fig. 1 1.2). The series is probably to be connected with the Olympic Games of AD 137. This group of coins shows Zeus seated in profile to the left.912 He sits in a very upright position, the confines of the throne appearing to contain the figure. His feet rest on a footstool. The right lower leg is pulled in while the left is set slightly in front. The left arm is bent at the elbow, with the forearm raised and the hand clutching an upright staff. The right arm is lowered, the forearm extended on the arm-rest of the throne and the hand turned upwards to bear a winged Nike. The bearded head is held erect and looks directly forward. Several long locks fall on to the shoulders, but the hair on the head is held in place with a leafy crown. The left upper arm is swathed in the god's mantle which also covers the lower body, one end falling in thick folds by the left thigh. The throne is very upright and rectilinear. A gem in Paris, which provides a unique image of the statue in its temple setting, supports this image of Zeus (Fig. 11.3), even if the 910 Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.30. 911 Lucian, Jup. Trag. 25. 912 Vlizos (1999) 10, group A; Franke (1984) pl. 52, 2-3. Boardman (1985) fig. 182.</page><page sequence="343">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 325 depiction of the temple is unrealistic. On the gem one sees Zeus hemmed in with a column on each side and a pitched roof just above his head.913 Two other groups of coin images, which appear superficially very close to the one just described, are judged by Vlizos to be only indirectly connected with the Pheidian Zeus and to illustrate different statues dating from later times. The first group, which also dates from the Hadrianic period, shows a seated Zeus in three-quarter view to the left with the head in profile to the left.914 The pose and drapery owe a debt to the Pheidian image in a general way but a major difference is that the left arm is brought out to the side and raised high. This image is very close to images of Zeus on coins of Antiochos IV Epiphanes (175-164 BC), probably reflecting a statue of his era. The statue seems to have been heavily influenced by the image of Zeus which started to appear in the 330s BC on coins of Alexander the Great. The other group, which dates from the beginning of the 3rd century AD, also shows a seated Zeus in three-quarter view to the left with the head in profile to the left.915 Here, however, not only is the left arm brought out to the side, but also there are changes to the arrangement of the drapery. Particularly characteristic is the little bundle of cloth on the left shoulder which replaces the swathe of folds falling forwards over the left side of the torso. This feature is thought by Vlizos to reflect a statue type dating from the later 4th century BC, which is now lost but which, he believes, was the prototype for a group of statues which conform to the scheme of a statue now in Malibu.916 Vlizos suggests that the drapery scheme of these coin images may be related to that of the very influential Jupiter Capitolinus type in Rome, a point which might explain the use of such an image on coins of the early 3rd century AD.917 A general reminder of the Pheidian Zeus in the images on both these groups of coins reflects the influence that this work had on later representations of the god seated on a throne. The differences they introduce both in the pose and the drapery come from later works and they do not assist in the reconstruction of the Pheidian statue. The Pheidian statue was characterized by a strictly frontal and upright pose. Probably because of the constraints imposed by the relative sizes of the statue and the naos in which it was housed, the limbs of the statue were not allowed to spread beyond the confines of the throne and the footstool which framed it. The coin images reflect statues which were free of these constraints, and which were given greater movement and a more relaxed pose. For the reconstruction of the head, Elian coins of around AD 133 perhaps preserve the best evidence (Fig. 11.4).918 They show in profile a bearded, long-haired male with a 913 Paris, Cabinet des Médailles, 1421a. The columns on either side of the figure and the pitched roof give an artist's impression of the confined space within which the colossal image sat. In reality, the naos would have had a flat ceiling and its columns would not have been so close to the statue. 914 Vlizos (1999) 11, group B; Franke (1984) pl. 51, 19-20. 915 Vlizos (1999) 11, group C; Franke (1984) pl. 50, 9-10. 916 Malibu, J.

The hair lies close to the skull in incised waves, and in looser locks below the wreath where it falls on to the shoulders. Vlizos points to the Zeus Albani and the Lateran Hermes for sculptures in the round with similar hair styles. Both these works are of Roman date but they are clearly based on high Classical prototypes.919 The Zeus statue at Olympia had the reputation of giving a true likeness of the king of the gods and no other statue was ever created in antiquity to rival it. It became the ideal representation of the powerful yet solemn ruler of both gods and men. Many images created in later periods, from Classical times to the end of the Roman Empire, were heavily dependent on the Pheidian Zeus, even if no sculptural copies of the whole composition have yet been found. In his study of the iconography of enthroned figures of Zeus, Vlizos has identified five different statuary schemes. He thinks they reflect so many different prototypes, now lost, ranging in date from the early 4th century BC to the early 1st century BC, some originating in Attica perhaps, others almost certainly in Asia Minor. Of these five schemes, the only one which Vlizos reckons can be connected iconographically with the Pheidian Zeus is the so-called Lyon scheme but, even in this case, the connection is probably indirect. The name-piece of this scheme is an early Antonine statuette in Lyon, and five other sculptures in the round which conform to the scheme have been found by Vlizos.920 They bear a strong resemblance to the image on the Hadrianic coins showing Zeus in profile to the left. Like the coins, this scheme has a strong, erect pose with the head looking straight forwards. The right-angle formed by the torso and the lap is echoed in the position of the right arm as well as in the shape of the throne. The right hand is upturned and, in some examples, locks of hair can be seen falling on to the shoulders. But the scheme diverges from that of the Pheidian Zeus in several important respects: the left arm is turned out to the side a little way, the position of the legs is reversed, and the attribute of the right hand is no longer a Nike. Vlizos assumes that the Lyon scheme originated in a statuary prototype of the first quarter of the 4th century BC, perhaps in Attica. The iconographical connection between this statuary scheme and the Pheidian Zeus, as proved by its similarity with the Hadrianic coins, allows one to understand better the arrangement of the drapery of the Pheidian Zeus, which cannot be seen fully in the profile view given on the coins. From the Lyon scheme one infers that the Pheidian Zeus wore his himation draped around his lower body, one end going round his back and falling in a swathe over his left shoulder and upper arm, the other end coming over his lap and falling along the outer side of his left leg. His upper torso would have been undraped. A number of later 4th century BC Attic votive reliefs, some still bearing a dedication to Zeus Meilichios, show a seated Zeus which conforms, more or less, to the Lyon scheme.921 With the Pheidian Zeus, many of the relief figures share the typical upright and frontal pose, the raised left forearm bearing the sceptre, the outstretched and upturned right hand, the drapery over the left shoulder and the position of the lower legs, with one foot 919 Vlizos (1999) 13. 920 Cat. nos.

Deviations from the Lyon scheme include resting the right forearm on the thigh (the throne may have no arm-rest or it may not be included at all) and placing the left rather than the right foot forwards.</page><page sequence="345">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 327 set forward, the other set back. Zeus is always shown with a heavy beard and, in some cases, locks of hair descend on to the shoulders. His chest is undraped. And yet the influence of the prototype of the Lyon scheme can be felt both in the attribute of the right hand, which is often a libation dish, as well as in the movement of the left arm out to the side. On many of these reliefs Zeus is shown with his left arm in profile while the torso is in three-quarter view. This suggests that the iconography of the Pheidian Zeus is connected indirectly with that of the Zeus on the Attic reliefs and that it was mediated by the prototype of the Lyon statuary scheme which must have been well known in Attica. Three sculptured heads, which may be reflections of the original statue are a head from Falerii, now in the Villa Giulia in Rome, a head from Cyrene (Fig. 1 1.5) and a head from Labraunda in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.922 They are all dated in the earlier or mid 4th century BC, that is in the late Classical period. The head in Cyrene might be the earliest and probably belonged to the cult statue of the temple of Zeus Olympios in Cyrene, where it was found in 1926. Together with the head was found a copy of the head of the Athena Parthenos, emphasizing the association with Pheidias. The head is over natural size, measuring 0.38m. It shows a bearded male with large eyes. There are traces of paint on the head. The large eyes and the rendering of the beard are close to those of the Falerii head. But the latter is in terracotta and quite small, measuring only 0.16m. This head comes from an Etruscan temple on the so-called Lo Scasato hill in Falerii. It is uncertain whether the head belonged to the architectural decoration of the temple or to a statue housed within the temple. The head now in Boston was found in Mylasa in Caria. It belonged to an acrolithic statue and has attachment holes for a metal polos or crown on the head. The head might have belonged to the temple image of Zeus Labraunda at Mylasa, but this statue was in all likelihood a standing figure, as the coins indicate. So although the head may show reflections of the Zeus at Olympia, the body did not. Vermeule calls the head a "slightly softened version of the Pheidian Zeus."923 Perhaps it was influenced by the work of the Mausoleum sculptors. Leventi dates the piece to around 350 BC.924 The red-figure bell-krater from Baksy in South Russia, dating from around 400 BC, has an image of a seated Zeus which loosely quotes the statue in Olympia. This is clear from such details as the elaborately carved throne, with the beginning of the Niobid frieze even preserved on the edge of the seat, the footstool, and the intricately adorned cloak, as Pausanias describes it, which covers the lower half of the god.925 The pose of the god, however, with his head turned to his left and bearing a worried expression, and his left hand brought up to his chin, does not suit the Zeus of Olympia who sat in a fully frontal position. Some features of the two figures are close but not identical: the thick wreath on the god's head is not an olive wreath, as the Zeus at Olympia wore, and the staff is held in the right rather than the left hand. Shefton suggests that the pose perhaps imitates that of the Zeus in the centre of the east pediment of the Parthenon.926 Given how little is known 922 Cat nos. (11) 34, 35 and 36.

The idea of showing Zeus seated, which allowed for the great scale of the sculpture, added to the dignity of the image. An important earlier precedent in relief sculpture, which may perhaps have influenced Pheidias, is the seated Zeus on the east frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi, dating from about 525 BC. Pheidias is known to have spent some time working in Delphi before 450 BC, making the Marathon monument. On the Siphnian Treasury east frieze, Zeus is shown in profile to the right, seated on an elaborate throne decorated with figures executed in relief between the seat and the arm-rest. He has three long locks falling over his right shoulder. His right arm is lowered and bent at right angles but, unlike the arm of the Zeus at Olympia, it is drawn back a little and does not touch the arm-rest. His left arm was apparently raised and held forwards, though the frieze is damaged at this point. Zeus may have been shown holding his sceptre. His feet rest on a low, rectangular plinth. As in the case of the Zeus at Olympia, the right foot and lower leg are drawn back. He is grouped with a number of other seated gods in council. This composition might well have been a source of inspiration for the gods of the east frieze of the Parthenon.927 An earlier image of a seated Zeus, dating to about 550-540 BC, occurs on the so-called Introduction pediment from the Akropolis in Athens, but this would have been buried at the time Pheidias was working and, therefore, not available as a source of inspiration. It is possible that some eastern influence can be detected in the seated pose. It has been suggested that the frieze from Persepolis influenced the Parthenon frieze. If this is true then it is not impossible that the seated Dareios (522-486 BC) on a relief in the reception hall in Persepolis influenced the Zeus statue. At any rate it seems to be the case that the Zeus statue inspired later depictions of Dareios in vase painting: Dareios is shown on a throne with Nikai and other details apparently inspired by the image in Olympia.928 Several of the later literary sources suggest that it was a literary image which inspired Pheidias, the majestic and awe-inspiring image of Zeus as described by Homer.929 The passage usually pointed to as inspiring Pheidias occurs when Thetis comes to Zeus to make her plea on behalf of Achilles, though here Homer says Zeus was sitting on the highest peak of Mount Olympus rather than on a throne. The political implications of Pheidias' s image at Olympia have been reassessed by Höcker and Schneider.930 They regard the image as presenting a type of Zeus that differs from earlier representations in which masculinity and vitality were the key-words. Here Zeus is the superior and mature father of the gods, effortless and impervious. The richly decorated throne, with its many different themes, and the paintings on the barriers associated with the statue enrich the image, presenting many different myths and stories about the gods. These are discussed in section 4, concerning the throne. Zeus's role as overseer of justice, law-giver, governor of human life, father, are alluded to in these myths. 927 Brinkmann (1994) discusses the Siphnian frieze in detail and provides excellent photographs; for a picture of the Zeus, see pl. 3.

In some cases specifically Athenian versions of myths were included too. Some of the myths had a distinctly political theme, whereas the metaphors of others are difficult for the modern scholar to decipher. 11.3. THE STATUE OF NIKE According to the sources and coins, the Pheidian statue of Zeus at Olympia held a Nike in the right hand. Pausanias describes her as made of ivory and gold and holding a fillet as well as wearing a wreath on her head.931 The coins and gems provide a rough idea of her appearance. Nike was facing Zeus, holding a wreath towards him with one hand, her wings still open on her back. She wore a long garment that billowed back in the lower part, as if the motion of flying could still be felt and she had just landed. Identifications in the round have been attempted, and one in particular is still associated with the image in Olympia. It concerns a statue type known in at least eleven replicas, most notably two in Berlin, K181-182 (cat. nos. (11) 40-41). Only one has its original head still in place, the Wellcome statuette in Newcastle (Fig. 1 1.6).932 The statue displays a Nike with feet kept together and the toes held downwards. The left arm is bent and held forward. She is dressed in a thin chiton with sleeves and has a long himation wrapped round the lower body, from the hips downwards, carried across and over the left forearm. On the chest lie two crossing bands, fastened with a Gorgon's head. The head of the Wellcome statuette has the hair parted at the front, carried back and gathered in a bun at the back. Behind the ears, next to the bun, some of the hair separates into a braided plait. Unlike representations on the coins and gems, the statuette has no wings and the arm is not raised to crown Zeus. The two Berlin statues (K1 8 1-1 82), however, have some cuttings on the back, now filled with pieces of marble, and it is possible that these cuttings were once used for separately added wings. The identification was originally made by Schräder in 1941, and was referred to several times in the following decades.933 But Gulaki's thorough work on Nikai, published in 1981, has brought the association of the type with Pheidias's statue in Olympia into serious doubt. Schräder attributed the head on the statue in Berlin (K182) to the type, but this idea was doubted by Becatti. Becatti believed that the Nike type was earlier than the Nike known from the Varvakeion statuette of the Athena Parthenos with which it otherwise shares the draping of the cloak. The elongated proportions and lack of folds in the drapery were felt to support the early date, which was then generally accepted for Pheidias's Zeus. But the Zeus is now known to be later than the Athena Parthenos and to date to the later 430s BC. Hermann suggested that the Berlin Nike is archaizing.934 Gulaki believes the type is based on a 4th century BC model because of the thin and close-fitting drapery, 931 Pausanias, V.l 1.1. 932 Cat. no.

They simply show that a Nike of roughly the Berlin type continued to be popular in the later Imperial period. With the publication of the finds from the workshop at Olympia, the discussion of the Olympian Nike, and in particular its scale, has again been brought into focus. Terracotta moulds were founds in the workshop and some of these seem to have been used in the production of a draped statue that was about three times life-size.938 That the figure in question may have been the Nike held in Zeus's hand, is a theory that was put forward by Schiering, but at times doubted even by him (Fig. 11.7a-b).939 The theory is generally disliked on the grounds that such a Nike would have been far too big. Zeus is thought to have measured somewhat over 12m in height. If his Nike was three times life-size, then she would have measured around 4m high. Scholars tend to compare these measurements with those of the Athena Parthenos and her Nike, who measured approximately 10.5m and 1.80m high respectively. The Nike was about life-size, or a little larger, while the Parthenos was six times larger. It has seemed unlikely that Pheidias would have chosen such different proportions for the figures in Olympia, especially since most of the coin representations of the composition show a small Nike, rather similar to the Parthenos Nike. Some scholars, however, find no problem with a Nike three times life-size for the Zeus composition.940 Although not substantially taller than the Parthenos, the Olympian composition represented Zeus seated. Therefore, the god must have been made on a much bigger scale than the figure of Athena. Consequently, the Olympian Nike might have been at least somewhat larger than the Athenian Nike. There is considerable variation in the representation of the Zeus composition on coins, and Schiering finds support for a large Nike in the earliest coin types from Elis, dating from around AD 121. 941 According to Kallimachos, the figures of the Horai and the Charités on the top of Zeus's throne were six 'feet' tall. It would not be surprising to discover that the Nike was taller, even if she was in fact considerably smaller than the three times life-size required for the moulds.

THE THRONE, FOOTSTOOL AND STATUE BASE The throne of the Zeus at Olympia is described in detail by Pausanias, in V.l 1.2-7. It was elaborately decorated with inlays in gold and gems, ebony and ivory, and complex figure groups were sculpted on it. The footstool of Zeus and the base which carried the entire composition, which Pausanias goes on to describe in V.l 1.7-8, were also decorated with figures, and there were painted barriers near the throne by Panainos. These too will be treated in this section. Only fragments of the very complex decoration of the throne can be traced in later works. The most widespread attributions will be discussed here. They are relevant to the following parts of the throne: the Nikai on the legs of the throne; the Sphinxes and Theban children, which supported the arm-rests; the killing of the Niobids by Apollo and Artemis on the two sides of the seat; the Amazonomachy on the front of the footstool; and the birth of Aphrodite on the base. Other parts of the throne were decorated too, as one learns from Pausanias. There were four decorated cross bars between the legs of the throne and there were two over life-size groups, each consisting of three figures, on either side of the top of the throne, above Zeus's head. In addition, there were painted barriers preventing visitors from trying to climb under the throne, according to Pausanias, the exact position of which is not known for certain. But, apart from some of the subjects treated in these parts of the decoration, nothing is known about these works and there are no known copies. (A) THE LEGS OF THE THRONE: THE NIKAI Pausanias writes that there were four dancing Nikai on each leg of the throne and another two at the bottom of each leg. This has generally been understood as meaning that all the Nikai were dancing, but Stähler reinterpreted this passage, suggesting that the two Nikai at the bottom of each leg were in a different position to the Nikai above them.943 Stähler attributed a particular type of kneeling girl, possibly a Nike, to the throne decoration. He found support for his attribution in a coin in Florence, clearly showing the Zeus statue on his throne, and he believed he could identify a kneeling Nike on the front leg (Fig. 1 1.2).944 Other scholars have expressed doubts about the attribution, in particular Gulaki, Gulaki-Voutira and Kabus-Preisshofen, who published the sculpture concerned in Antike Plastiků There are four replicas of the kneeling Nike type (cat. nos. (11) 51-54) and these are 0.70m high, that is approximately two-thirds natural size, which agrees well with the size of other works attributed to the Zeus statue at Olympia, such as the sphinx group, 942 Lapatin (2001) 82. 943 Stähler (1978) 68-86. 944 Stähler (1978) 85. 945 Gulaki (1981) 168-71; Gulaki-Voutira (1992) 868, no. 205, and 900, and Kabus- Preisshofen (1988) 11-19.</page><page sequence="350">332 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS discussed below. The young girl is shown kneeling, her body resting on her bare feet. Her upper body leans back slightly. The head and general pose are strictly frontal. She wears a peplos with kolpos, or overfold, buttoned on each shoulder with a round, flat buckle. The thighs are long and slim and, like the heels, they are placed tightly together, while the toes press against the ground. Both arms are lowered, following the upper body and the side of the thighs. It is uncertain what attribute, if any, the hands originally held. On the back there is a deep depression in the apoptygma. The statue type shows a combination of a strict, almost severe upper body combined with a tightly fitting garment on the lower body. The drapery folds are flat and few, presenting a combination of early and late 5th century traits. Stähler justified the rather non-Pheidian treatment of the drapery on the grounds that the Nikai were a less important part of the decoration.946 The frontality, he thought, was due to the throne leg being circular, and there being four Nikai on each leg, eight in all. Stähler' s most important evidence is the Hadrianic coin with its supposed representation of the kneeling Nike, but the figure in question is very difficult to make out even on very good pictures of the coin. Preferable are the interpretations offered by either Gulaki or Kabus-Preisshofen. Gulaki argued that the statue type was a Roman aemulatio , a combination of severe features, as seen on the pediment of the Zeus temple at Olympia, and later Classical ones, as known from the Nike temple in Athens. Kabus-Preisshofen, who has studied this statue type most thoroughly, was able to show that the kneeling pose with bare feet belonged in a devotional context limited to certain religious situations that are seldom depicted in Greek sculpture. She believes the original statue held an aspersorium in her hands, as had already been suggested by Hauser and Arndt.947 The later use of the statues as well or spring figures would seem to be in line with their original purpose. Kabus-Preisshofen suggests that the difficulties involved in trying to date the type could perhaps be explained by a western Greek origin.948 This might account for the apparent mixture of severe and late 5th century styles. She interprets the girl's pose as characteristic of a servant, perhaps a servant of Zeus Meilichios or the birth goddess.949 Indeed, kneeling representations of Eileithyia exist, as well as a number of terracotta statuettes in the same pose, which are associated with the cult of Eileithyia.950 These statuettes are Classical works from South Italy. The presence of Nikai on the legs of the throne reminds one of the large Nike standing on the hand of Zeus. Zeus was shown as a bringer of victory, in the games as well as in other spheres of life. 946 Stähler (1978) 84. 947 Hauser, EA , 532, and Arndt, B rBr 563 n. 3. 948 Kabus-Preisshofen (1988) 17-19. 949 Kabus-Preisshofen (1988) 18, n. 23. 950 Kabus-Preisshofen (1988) 18, n. 24.</page><page sequence="351">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 333 (B) THE SPHINX GROUPS Pausanias says that there were Theban youths being carried off by sphinxes on each of the front legs of the throne.951 Sphinxes were always popular for furniture decoration. Eichler was able to show that on the best preserved Hadrianic coin of the Zeus statue, which is in Florence, a sphinx was just visible below the arm-rest (Fig. 11.2).952 Therefore, the sphinx groups must have acted as supports for the arm-rests; they were not on the legs of the throne, as Pausanias says. A sphinx sitting on its haunches, with large wings stretched out behind it, is still visible supporting the arm-rest of the throne of Zeus (figure E.V.30) on the east frieze of the Parthenon. Eichler advanced the theory that certain fragments, found in Ephesos and now in Vienna and London (cat. nos. (1 1) 55-56), belong to copies of these groups, the grey colour of their stone imitating the dark colour of the original throne, which was probably of ebony or dark Eleusinian limestone. The fragments were all found in the vicinity of the harbour gymnasium at Ephesos, which formed part of the harbour baths. The baths were erected either under Domitian (AD 81-96) or in the early 2nd century AD. The fragments must be dated after the construction date of the baths, and probably in the first half of the 2nd century AD. From the Ephesos fragments, the following reconstruction of the sphinx groups was made possible (Fig. 11.8). The figures are set on a small rocky plinth. The sphinx, with animal lower and female upper body, fitted with large wings and a curled tail under the hind legs, is represented with chest raised. It rests its hind legs on the rocky ground. The position is almost frontal, the head turned slightly to its left. The sphinx has long wavy hair. The youth is placed partly below and partly in front of the sphinx. The hind legs of the sphinx pin down the feet of the youth, who sits with his legs pulled up and his head falling backwards to his right. He raises his right arm and bends it forward to shield himself, while he supports himself on his left hand (Fig. 11.9). His mouth is open. His hair is short and curly. The Ephesos fragments seem to come from the only two surviving monumental executions of this subject in Graeco-Roman art. Exact copying of the elements of the throne was perhaps not possible and this might explain the lack of replicas. In general Eichler' s views have been followed by most scholars, though one dissenting voice should be mentioned: Harrison believes the Ephesos group is a Roman creation, though she leaves open the possibility that the group was a later derivation of the Pheidian sculptures.953 She believes Pheidias could have been inspired by Egyptian iconography, for depictions of defeated enemies of the pharaoh being trampled by sphinxes have been found on panels below the arm-rests of several thrones as well as on a foot support. Simon thinks that the sphinxes on the throne of Zeus were demons of death, showing Zeus 's power over life and death.954 She views the reference to Theban youths by Pausanias as a later explanation.

According to myth, Hera had sent the sphinx to Thebes as a punishment for Laius's abduction of Chrysippus from Pisa. The sphinx would ask her famous riddle to any Theban traveller who passed by and, if they could not answer, she strangled and devoured her victim. Like the killing of the Niobids, this theme reminds one of the supremacy of the gods over mortals, and the threat of punishment to wrong-doers and all associated with them. The sphinx, with her riddle about mankind, also carries the specific message of the importance of true self-knowledge. As a symbol of wisdom, the sphinx was depicted at the very top of the Athena Parthenos composition, on Athena's helmet. According to Pliny, this sphinx was one of the marvels of the work.956 Since Chrysippus was a son of Pelops, by the Danaid Astyoche, the presence of the avenging sphinxes on Zeus' throne had local relevance too. There was perhaps also a political dimension to the use of this image, as an allusion to the rightful punishment of Thebes for her treachery during the Persian Wars. If it is correct to see the Ephesian statues as copies of Pheidias 's arm-rest supports, then the beauty and femininity of the sphinxes should be noted: the monsters are as beautiful as their victims. Harrison points out as a possible parallel the beautiful, but dangerous, Pandora on the base of the Athena Parthenos.957 One might note too how the representation of the killing enforces compassion: while the sphinx tears the youth with her lion claws, she affectionately bends down to kiss him. The Persian wars were long since over when the Zeus was made, and Thebes had received her punishment. Any reference to this chapter of history had to be made in a manner that was acceptable to all Greeks. (C) THE KILLING OF THE NIOBIDS Apollo and Artemis shooting the children of Niobe is the next motif mentioned by Pausanias, in V.11.2. Pausanias describes it as figuring beneath the sphinxes. It is generally agreed that the sphinxes supported the arm-rests, and the evidence of the Baksy krater suggests that the Niobids adorned the side edges of the throne seat (Fig. 1 1.10).958 The motif had already been identified in a series of Neo-Attic reliefs by Furtwängler.959 The bell-krater from Baksy, which dates to the end of the 5th century BC or a little later, has on its back a fragmentary Dionysiac scene. On the main side, the upper register is best preserved. It shows a number of gods in a continuous row, reminiscent of the Parthenon east pediment and it is possible that the central group is loosely based on this composition. In the central group are three gods who seem to stand out due to their larger size and the fact that they are less involved in the action: they are Zeus, Athena and Hera. Zeus is seen sitting on his throne between the standing Athena and Hera. Under Zeus 's 955 See, for instance, the lekythos by the Haimon Painter, Syracuse, 12085; ABL 241, 8; Boardman (1979) fig. 273. 956 Pliny, NH 36.18. 957 Harrison (1996) 62. 958 For the Baksy krater see Shefton (1982) 149ff. 959 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 43 n. 4.</page><page sequence="353">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 335 arm-rest can be observed the first part of a figured scene which must originally have occupied the length of the side of Zeus 's seat. The first figure appears to be a kneeling male and in front of him is the drapery of another person who is running away. The kneeling figure is of exactly the same type as that of Apollo as seen on two reliefs that are associated with the throne (Fig. 11.1 1 ).960 The drapery of the fleeing figure can also be matched on reliefs in Modena and Bologna.961 These reliefs, together with a number of other related reliefs, preserve about fourteen to sixteen figures, including Apollo and Artemis, all of which have been related to the throne reliefs (Figs. 11.11-19). The disc in the British Museum shows a large number of figures that can be ascribed not only to the Pheidian reliefs but also to the so-called Florentine circle of Niobids. Geominy, who has worked most extensively on the theme of Niobids, concludes that the disc in the British Museum combines the two sorts of figure types.962 The Pheidian figure types predominate, but they are taken completely out of their original context. So, for instance, one of the fleeing women, who is normally seen upright, appears horizontally on the British Museum disc.963 Several scholars have attempted to reconstruct the order of the figures, but their suggestions remain very tentative. The evidence of the Baksy krater indicates a fleeing male figure in front of Apollo, and perhaps one is justified in expecting a similar figure type in front of Artemis.964 In her thorough discussion of the matter Vogelpohl, who sees the two sides as part of one continuous composition, argued that the gods were probably placed at the beginning and end of the composition in order to frame the scene (Fig. 11.12).965 She envisages the gods shooting their arrows in towards the centre of the composition, with the children of Niobe fleeing from the arrows. She also suggests that Niobe and Amphion, the parents of the children, were included in the composition, probably towards the centre and as a counterweight to the gods who stand at each end. Thus, each seat side is seen as having a god at one end, a number of figures all fleeing in one direction, some fallen figures, and a parent at the other end. Contrary to the evidence from the Baksy krater, Vogelpohl reconstructs the scene with a collapsed figure in front of both Apollo and Artemis. Such an arrangement would allow room for the arrows of the gods to fly further. Geominy agrees with Vogelpohl that Niobe and Amphion were probably represented in the scene. He refrains from suggesting any reconstruction, but he identifies as Niobe the woman supporting her son, seen on the relief in St. Petersburg (Fig. 11.13) and a ringstone in Munich.966 He identifies as Amphion the seated male 960 Cat. nos.

Though there is no evidence to support this view, he suggests that it is Leto's hand that can be seen on the shoulder of Artemis on the relief fragment from Isthmia.968 The action takes place in a rocky landscape, similar to that seen on the shield of Athena Parthenos, again with figures in many different poses. But the Niobid reliefs are very different from the Parthenos shield reliefs and they seem to reveal something of the evolution of Pheidias's style in the years after the creation of the Athena Parthenos. For now one is aware of a more developed style, which is flamboyant in its use of drapery and which allows greater expression of emotion. The pathetic subject matter and the presence of truly feminine figures lend themselves to this style. The figures are given very varied attitudes, and there is often a feeling that the sculpture has succeeded in capturing a fleeting moment. The dead youth slumped over a rock on St. Petersburg A434 is a good example, as are the two sisters on the same relief, one of them supporting the other who has collapsed and has sunk to her knees (Fig. 11.14). Much use is made of swirling, flying drapery, to set off naked or semi-naked figures and to give the impression of movement and drama. Notice the drapery flying out behind the kneeling youth on the Colonna relief, and the arching cape behind the kneeling group on the British Museum tondo. Vogelpohl is probably right to suggest that there was a greater distance between the figures in the original composition than can be seen in the Roman copies. Bearing in mind the very large scale and the extremely elaborate decoration of the Zeus, spreading the figures out over the surface would have made the scene more effective. The original figures were made either in gold or ivory and then attached to the background. This was probably black, as the throne was made of ebony. The exact length of the composition is difficult to determine. From Kallimachos, VI, frgm. 196, one can calculate that the height of the throne was about 9.90m and that of the whole statue about 12.3m. Modern scholars have reconstructed the depth of the throne as between 2.5m and 3m. and the height of the seat as about 0.5m. It is generally agreed that on each of the two sides of the seat there were figured six children, perhaps a parent, and at least one god. Such an arrangement would allow ample space between the figures. Vogelpohl believes that a relief of this size, with all the figures moving in the same direction, would not have been very popular with the Romans for villa and garden decoration. This could explain why the figures were mixed freely and placed closer together in the copies, producing a shorter and more varied composition. Vogelpohl traces the first copies of these friezes to the late 2nd/early 1st century BC and continuing into the Imperial period, with the majority of the reliefs included here dating to the 2nd century AD. Geominy dates the relief from Tarentum, now in Bonn, to around 300 BC, and the reliefs in Florence, Kassel, and Rome to the 1st century AD.969 The reliefs in Bologna and Sorrento and the London tondo are dated to the early or middle part of the 2nd century AD.970 According to Geominy, the remainder of the depictions are all of Imperial date, some of them specifically from the later 2nd century 967 Cat. no.

More use seems to have been made of dramatically swirling drapery to set off the naked human form, for instance, and there are several examples of complex groupings in which figures support one another or interact closely, unlike on the Parthenos shield where few of the figures touch each other. The effect is more dramatic and the presence of small children in such a violent scene adds pathos. In the Roman reception of the Pheidian relief images, the Augustan temple of Apollo on the Palatine probably played an important part.972 It had doors with relief depictions in ivory applied to ebony. Apollo was shown throwing Gauls down from Parnassos on one door panel and the killing of the Niobids was depicted on the other. Unfortunately, the Augustan depiction is known only from the literary sources, but it is tempting to see the composition as an inspiration for the tondo in the British Museum, which combined Pheidian figure types with the newer Florentine Niobids.973 The Niobids, who died because of their mother's hubris, demand both pity and respect. They suffered for their mother's sin and they are depicted as helping each other as they fall before the arrows of the gods. As in the sphinx motif, the theme of nemesis is at the forefront. Niobe boasted of having both more children and more beautiful ones than Leto, mother of Apollo and Artemis. The well-known result was that Artemis and Apollo killed all Niobe's children, as well as her husband king Amphion, but they let Niobe herself survive to live with her despair and sorrow. There is perhaps another indirect reference to the Thebans here, for Amphion was from Thebes. In the context of a statue for the Zeus of Olympia, where athletes competed for the most important prizes, the warnings against hubris embedded in both this myth and in that of the sphinx are very appropriate. The story has further relevance in the context of the Zeus composition in that Niobe was a grand-daughter of Zeus. She was the daughter of Tantalus and the sister of Pelops. Pausanias was told that the story of Pelops, and his defeat of Oinomaos, formed the subject of the east pediment of the temple, but this may be incorrrect.974 Pausanias also saw Hippodameia and Sterope, the daughter and the wife of Oinomaos, on one of the painted screens by Panainos in the naos. Apollo, one of the avenging deities in the story of the Niobids, may have figured at the centre of the west pediment overseeing the defeat of the Centaurs.975 971 St. Petersburg, no. 15b, 2nd century AD; Modena, no. 15c, second half of the 2nd century AD; Villa Albani, no. 15d, Imperial; London, British Museum and Palazzo Colonna, nos. 15i-j, 2nd century AD; Catania, no. 15k, Imperial; Isthmia, no. 15m, second half of the 2nd century AD (Cat. nos.

The front bar originally showed eight figures of boy athletes. One figure had become indistinct by Pausanias's day. Another showed a diadoumenos type, which was popularly called 'Pantarkes', the youth Pheidias was supposed to have loved. As far as one can tell from Pausanias's description of the composition, this relief was the only direct reference to the Olympic games. Pausanias says that he supposes the contests shown on the front bar must be ancient, because in Pheidias' s day there were no contests for boys. But this is surely a mistake for, in another passage, Pausanias himself states that boys' contests were introduced at the 37th. Olympic festival, that is in 632 BC.976 The side bars, which bore twenty-nine figures in all, showed Herakles, with Theseus as his ally, fighting the Amazons. In the Archaic period, Herakles alone was often shown fighting the Amazons. At this time the story of the rape of the Amazon Antiope by Theseus, sometimes with the help of his friend Peirithous, was always treated as a completely unrelated episode. The first appearance in Greek art of Theseus fighting with Herakles against the Amazons is in metope 8 of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi, which probably dates from about 490 BC or a little later.977 In the Classical period, the Heraklean Amazonomachy, which was supposed to have taken place in the east, tends to become rarer in Greek art, while the Thesean Amazonomachy, which is set in Athens, becomes much more prevalent. As the story evolved, the rape of Antiope was gradually seen as an event which happened when Theseus was helping Herakles fight the Amazons in the east, and which caused the return attack by the Amazons on Attica. Both Amazonomachies seem to have featured on Zeus 's throne, for while the Amazonomachy in the east figured on the bars between the legs, the Athenian Amazonomachy seems to have been the subject of the front of the footstool. The prominence given to Herakles on both the side bars of the throne as well as on the painted panels by Panainos is appropriate given that Herakles was the son of Zeus, the founder of the Olympic Games and an ancestor of the Dorians. There is no mention of sculptures on the back bar of the throne. Presumably the back of the throne was intended to stand quite close to the back wall of the naos, making adornments on this side unnecessary. Pausanias records that there were four pillars beneath the throne, helping to support it.978 He says they were between the legs. If this is so, they were probably set back from the sculpted bars and positioned more directly underneath the main body of the colossal statue, in order to help sustain its weight. (E) THE PAINTED SCREENS BY PANAINOS It was not possible, according to Pausanias, for visitors to go under the throne of the Zeus at Olympia because there were painted barriers, like walls, preventing any access. The front barrier was painted plain blue, while the others bore figured paintings depicting various Greek myths by the artist Panainos, a close relation and colleague of Pheidias. Pausanias enumerates nine different subjects, each with two figures. The position of the barriers is 976 Pausanias, V.8.9. 977 Neils (1994) 928, no. 54. 978 Pausanias, V. 1 1 .4.</page><page sequence="357">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 339 not known for certain. Because Pausanias mentions them in the middle of his description of the throne, just after mentioning the crossbars and the pillars, it is sometimes thought that they were positioned on the statue base between the legs of the throne.979 Evelyn- White argued that Pausanias lists the paintings in the order in which he saw them, and that they stood in three groups of three, positioned on three sides of the throne, with the front side, facing the doors into the naos, having the plain blue barrier.980 There are several reasons for thinking that the paintings were in fact placed at some distance from the throne. Pausanias 's description of the pillars under the throne suggests that visitors had a clear view of the space under the throne. There is no sign of any barriers between the legs of the throne on the coin representations. The fact that only three of the crossbars of the throne, the front one and the two side ones, were adorned with figured sculptures, suggests that the back of the throne was less visible and less adorned. If so, painted screens beneath the back crossbar also seem unlikely. Excavations in the temple have revealed that there were marble barriers across the naos at the level of the second columns and up to the level of the fifth columns, closing off the area in front of the statue.981 It seems that at a later stage wooden barriers were added between the remaining columns at the west end of the naos, to protect the sides of the statue. There were also wooden doors closing off the side aisles at the level of the second columns.982 When these were added is not known. It is possible that the painted screens were placed around the enclosed area in front of the statue. In the order in which Pausanias lists them the subjects of the paintings were as follows: Atlas and Herakles; Theseus and Peirithous; Hellas and Salamis; Herakles and the Nemean lion; Ajax and Kassandra; Hippodameia and Sterope; Prometheus and Herakles; Penthesileia and Achilles; and two Hesperides. The most prominent subject seems to have been Herakles. He was shown waiting to take the sky from the shoulders of Atlas, fighting the Nemean lion, as well as about to release the enchained Prometheus. The depiction of the two Hesperides, mentioned last by Pausanias, is also related to the Herakles theme and it brings one neatly back to the beginning of Panainos's series of paintings. For with the help of the dragon, Ladon, the Hesperides guarded the tree that bore the golden apples which, according to one version of the story, Herakles persuaded Atlas to fetch for him. The labours of Herakles formed the subject of the temple metopes, but there the subjects were treated differently. In east metope 10 Herakles was represented holding up the sky and wondering how to take the apples from Atlas who stood before him. Panainos depicted the figures with the roles reversed: Atlas holding up the sky and Herakles standing in front of him. In west metope 1, Herakles was represented resting after he has killed the lion, whereas Panainos showed the fight itself. The second composition bears some relation to the subject of the west pedimental group of the temple, for it depicted the protagonists in the fight against the Centaurs, Theseus and Peirithous. The exact subject of Panainos's painting is not known and the context in which the two figures appeared could have been radically different from that of the west pediment. They were perhaps shown in another famous adventure, waiting to be freed from 979 Pausanias, V. 11.4-6. 980 Evelyn- White (1908) 53. 981 See Mallwitz (1972) 230. 982 Hermann (1972) 151 and fig. 103.</page><page sequence="358">340 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the Underworld by Herakles. If this was the case, then the painting would clearly relate to the Herakles stories. The sixth composition, showing Hippodameia and her mother Sterope, may have been related to the east pediment, if one can trust Pausanias concerning its subject matter, but this remains uncertain.983 At any rate, as the daughter and wife of Oinomaos, king of Pisa, Hippodameia and Sterope belonged to local mythology. Two compositions are drawn from the stories of Troy: Ajax' s crime against Kassandra, whom he dragged from the image of Athena, when Troy fell, and then violated; and Achilles holding the dying queen of the Amazons, Penthesileia. Ajax's crime was an important case of hybris and it was severely punished by Athena. The subject also figured on the famous chryselephantine chest of Kypselos, in the temple of Hera at Olympia.984 The image of Achilles holding the dying Penthesileia, as opposed to the more usual image of Achilles about to deliver the death blow, seems to be without precedent in Greek art.985 Finally there was a strange allegorical picture representing the personifications of Hellas and Salamis. Salamis, daughter of the river Asopos, was shown holding an ornament for a ship, which suggests a reference to the Battle of Salamis and the defeat of the Persians. The Battle of Salamis, which took place in 480 BC, and which was a resounding sea victory for all the Greeks united against the Persians, was a matter for pride particularly amongst the Athenians since it was Themistokles who persuaded the other Greek generals to lure the Persian fleet into a battle in the narrow straits between Salamis and the mainland, where speed and skill were of more avail than sheer numbers. Like the Athenian Amazonomachy of the footstool, this painting paid special honour to the Athenians. Along with the fact that the chief sculptor and painter for the statue were Athenian, this suggests that, at the time when the Zeus was made, Athens and Elis, which controlled the sanctuary at Olympia, were on good terms. (F) THE BACK OF THE THRONE Pausanias says that on either side of the top of the throne, and above Zeus 's head, there were representations of the three Graces and the three Seasons. This part of the throne must have been closely imitated by Theokosmos of Megara, for Pausanias, 1.40.4, reports that in his composition there were the Seasons and the Fates above the head of Zeus. According to Kallimachos, the figures at the top of the throne were one fathom in height, that is, almost 2m.986 Kallimachos also says that the god was five cubits higher than his throne. Perhaps the painting on the front of the Baksy krater shows how one is to imagine the throne: the back of the seat reaching up to about the level of Zeus 's shoulders, and the Charités and Horai standing on either side of the throne back, carved completely in the round. On the Baksy krater these positions are occupied by two sitting sphinxes with upraised wings. The Charités and Horai, both three in number, were daughters of Zeus by two of his lovers: Eurynome and Themis, respectively. The Charités were the personification of loveliness or grace, but they perhaps also symbolized the bloom of nature. They may have been goddesses of vegetation in origin. The Horai symbolized the seasons of spring, 983 See Patay-Horváth (2004) 21-33. 984 See Pausanias, V.19.5; Arafat (1995) 465. 985 See Kossatz-Deichmann (1981) 165, 169-71, no. 739. y°õ Kallimachos, Iambi VI, frgm. 196.</page><page sequence="359">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 341 summer and winter. As god of the sky and the weather, and the giver of laws that govern the course of events, Zeus was intimately related with these goddesses. (G) THE AMAZONOMACHY OF THE FOOTSTOOL Pausanias describes Zeus's footstool in V.11.7. He says that there were golden lions worked on it as well as Theseus's battle against the Amazons. In another passage, V.10.2, he says that the inscription, stating that Pheidias son of Charmides made the statue, was below the feet of the statue, so it is possible that this inscription too was on the footstool. The Athenian Amazonomachy, which also figured on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos by Pheidias, became a popular subject from about the 470s BC. It seems to have originated in Athens and to have figured on murals in both the Athenian Theseion and the Stoa Poikile. In this version of the story Theseus is the heroic leader of the Athenians in the first attack by foreigners on home territory. As such, it was quickly seen as an allegory for Persian defeats headed by the Athenians, at Marathon, and then at Salamis. As Harrison points out, the presence of this version of the story on the footstool of the Olympian statue implies that there was "peace and accommodation with Athens for the time being."987 Fink thought he recognized a copy of the Olympian version of the Athenian Amazonomachy in a relief depiction found on a round statue base at Nikopolis on the isthmus of the bay of Actium (Figs. 1 1.20-21).988 This town was founded by Augustus after the Battle of Actium and Fink dated the base to the Augustan period. Part of the relief was damaged by the superimposition of mosaics in the early 6th century AD, when the base was used as a platform for a pulpit in the basilica built by Alkyson. Some of these mosaics still cover the original relief depiction.989 That the relief depicted the Athenian Amazonomachy is clear from the absence of Herakles, the absence also of horses, and the presence of Theseus, distinguished by his heroic nudity and his pose.990 Fink regarded the work as a copy of a Pheidian original because of noticeable similarities between some of the figure types on the base and those of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. Furthermore, he identified it as a copy of the relief on the footstool of the Zeus because of the shape of the frieze, which is long and narrow, with all the figures set at the same level and in a long line.991 This arrangement is quite different from that of Pheidias's shield representation of the same story. Many scholars have followed Fink in his identification of the Nikopolis statue base as a copy of the footstool Amazonomachy. One dissenting voice is that of Strocka who regards the work as dating from the 2nd century AD, in imitation of a late 5th century BC original, close in style to the frieze of the Nike temple on the Athenian Akropolis.992 987 Harrison (1996) 62. 988 Cat. no.

In keeping with an Athenian setting, all the combatants are on foot and there are no horses. The Amazons fight with lances or bows and arrows, and some of them carry shields. Unlike the Parthenos shield Amazons, some of them wear Asian bonnets and trousers. The Greeks fight with swords or, interestingly, with stones, and while some of them are naked, others wear a chiton and, again quite unlike the Parthenos shield, the hoplite cuirass. Some parts of the composition and certain figure types recall the shield of Athena Parthenos and other works related to Pheidias. For example, take the composition of the two figures, Theseus and an Amazon, sweeping away from each other, two of their legs forming a central cross, their heads turned to look at the other in enmity, their arms raised holding a weapon: this is very reminiscent of the central group of the west pediment of the Parthenon.993 A similar pattern is used at the left end of the visible part of the relief, only this time it appears that the figure on the right is seen from back, not front view.994 The pose of the legs and torso of Theseus can also be compared with those of the Lapith on south metope 27 of the Parthenon. The fact that Theseus is threatening his adversary with a stone reminds one of the problematic figure at the top of the Parthenos shield: this man was probably naked, like the other Greek heroes, but he may have been bald and he alone was holding a stone. Again with regard to Theseus' s adversary, the Amazon who steps away from Theseus, looking back at him, with her right arm drawn across her body ready to lash back at him, one sees exactly the same figure type as that used in the group set at the bottom of the shield of the Parthenos, the adversary of the so-called pilos-wearer. Another noteworthy group, placed several figures to the left of the Theseus group, is that of the Amazon who has just been wounded in the back and who is beginning to sink down to the ground. Her adversary is behind her and he seems to be striking her in the back. In pain, the Amazon's body arches itself, her head falls back and she raises her right arm and bends it back in an attempt to reach the wound. In different respects, the pose of the Amazon may be compared with two figures on the Parthenos shield. The way in which she sinks to her knees and reaches for the weapon in her back with her raised right arm is similar to the Amazon wounded in the back in the Munich group.995 The way she arches her body and throws back her head recalls the Amazon in the so-called death leap group. The Greek attacker is mostly missing, for the base was cut at this point when it was reused, but his hand almost touches the Amazon's back, suggesting that he is striking her and that his pose is similar to that of the figure generally taken to be Theseus on the Parthenos shield. Less interesting is the pair shown in the traditional hair-pulling motif, so often seen on vase representations of an Amazonomachy, and the two Greek warriors in the Harmodios pose. In many places the figures are two deep and the general impression is very cluttered. This is quite unlike Pheidias 's composition on the Parthenos shield. (H) THE STATUE BASE: THE BIRTH OF APHRODITE The floor of the excavated temple of Zeus reveals that the outer dimensions of the statue base measured 6.54m wide and 9.82m deep. Some of the stones for the base survive. They are of dark Eleusinian marble, which is bluish black in colour, like the sunken pavement in 993 For the figures of Theseus and the Amazon see Fink (1964/1965) fig. 46. 994 Fink (1964/1965) fig. 48. 995 See Meyer (1987) fig. 1, for instance.</page><page sequence="361">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 343 front of the statue.996 They have a moulded profile and are 1.11m high. This accords well with the measurements given by Kallimachos. Pausanias writes that there were golden figures in relief on the base.997 The figures were probably worked separately in metal and dowelled on to the base, although it is also possible that they were carved in the stone and then gilded.998 Pausanias recounts that the subject of the depiction was the birth of Aphrodite in the presence of a large number of gods, seventeen figures in all. In order he mentions, Helios, Zeus, Hera, another figure, perhaps Hephaistos, a Grace, Hermes, Hestia. At the centre of the composition was Aphrodite shown rising out of the sea. She was being received by Eros, and Peitho was crowning her. Then came Apollo, Artemis, Athena, Herakles, Amphitrite, Poseidon and finally Selene. The story is related by Hesiod in the Theogony and it is perhaps from this source that Pheidias drew his inspiration.999 There might be a reflection of the central image of the relief on a medallion from Galaxidi now in the Louvre (Fig. 1 1.22). 1000 The medallion bears a silver-gilt relief showing Aphrodite rising from the sea and being received by Eros. Aphrodite is naked and she holds a piece of material in her left hand.1001 The subject is not uncommon in vase-painting.1002 The evidence for the Parthenos base, which bears a relief with a similar theme, suggests a simple composition: a line of quietly standing figures. The same is true of the base by Pheidias's pupil, Agorakritos, for the Nemesis of Rhamnous, which is clearly influenced by Pheidias (Pausanias, 1.33.2-8). A very similar scheme may well have been adopted in the case of the Olympian base too, for the figures standing on each side of the central group. Palagia explains the choice of the subject for the base in terms of Aphrodite's role as chief goddess of Elis, the city which controlled the sanctuary at Olympia.1003 According to Pausanias, VI.25.1, the Eleians also commissioned Pheidias to make a chryselephantine statue of the goddess. 996 Mallwitz (1964) 77ff. 997 Pausanias, V.11.8. 998 Palagia (2000) 57 prefers the former alternative, regarding the cheaper method of gilded stone as unnecessary given the budget Pheidias must have had for the Olympian statue. As she points out, Pheidias's pupil, Agorakritos, had to resort to the cheaper option when he made the Nemesis at Rhamnous during the Peloponnesian War, and it is possible that Alkamenes did the same when he made the base for the cult statues of Hephaistos and Athena in the Hephaisteion. 999 Hesiod, Theog. , 154-210. 1000 Cat. no.

THE WORKSHOP AT OLYMPIA Pausanias, V.15.1, mentions that there was a workshop outside the Altis, to the west of the temple of Zeus, in which Pheidias created his statue of Zeus. When Pausanias visited the sanctuary in AD 174 there was an altar in the building. During excavations in 1954-1958 this building was successfully identified and the findings were published by Mallwitz and Schiering in 1964. More recently, Schiering has presented further finds from the workshop, which shed light on the techniques used in Olympia for the creation of large-scale statuary drapery.1004 Mattusch has raised doubts about whether any of the finds can be associated with Pheidias 's Zeus.1005 In particular, she has questioned the use by Pheidias of the workshop moulds which may date from the very end of the 5th century BC. Lapatin argues that the dating of the finds is not as sound as some people might like to believe, and in any case the finds merely give a terminus ante quern for the revolutionary use of certain techniques and drapery styles.1006 That the finds in the rubbish heap outside the workshop are correctly associated with works destined for the sanctuary is at least suggested by the delicate and precious nature of the works involved, which would have been difficult to transport any great distance without damage. One of the most famous objects discovered in the workshop was a cup bearing a graffito identifying the cup as belonging to Pheidias (Fig. 11. 23). 1007 The authenticity of the inscription has been doubted over the years, but Heilmeyer examined the cup thoroughly under a microscope and traced slag and cinders lodged in the letters from its stay in the soil.1008 He discovered that the inscription is earlier than a break to the cup, which damaged the letter omicron of the inscription. The workshop had a stone socle, mud-brick walls and unfluted columns. It was later rebuilt with fired brick and used as a Byzantine church. The size of the building is around 6.54-5m by 13.08-9m, which is identical with the measurements of the naos of the temple of Zeus. Mallwitz sees this as an indication that Pheidias's image was constructed in full size here before being moved to the temple inside the Altis.1009 But it is unlikely that the statue was completely built in the workshop and then transported to the temple. The weight of the statue would surely have been too great for the workshop floor, not to mention the immense problems of moving the statue. It is more probable that the work was planned and pieces made up in the workshop, but that the final construction was carried out in the temple. Some scholars suggest that Pheidias had two wooden cores for the statue, one in the temple and one in the workshop, on which the ivory and gold plates could be fitted. But this sounds wasteful both in terms of the materials and the work involved, for the wooden core was probably a detailed carving in its own right, and, according to Dio Chrysostomos, it would have been made of costly, imperishable woods, 1004 Schiering (1991). 1005 Mattusch (1994) 226. 1006 Lapatin (2001) 82. 1007 Cat. no.

On these grounds Mallwitz and Schiering infer that it was erected around 440-430 BC and cleared out in around 410 BC.1011 A wealth of different materials have surfaced in the workshop, all of them in tiny amounts: bone, horn, pigs' teeth, shells, bronze, lead, obsidian, pumice, amber, chalk, gypsum, glass, trace amounts of various pigments, quartz, ivory and ebony. This accords well with Pausanias's description of the statue of Zeus. The most interesting find consists of a number of clay moulds. Traces of clear and very pale green glass have been found in these moulds, along with corundum powder, which served to prevent molten glass from adhering to the clay of the moulds.1012 The moulds were used to produce glass ornaments in geometrical and floral patterns as well as drapery belonging to a female statue of approximately three times life-size (Fig. 11.24). The discovery of the moulds was surprising not only because Olympia is one of the only places on the Greek mainland where a 5th century BC glass workshop has been found, but also because the moulds were used not for jewellery or vessels of any kind but for statuary. If not actually used for the Zeus at Olympia, the moulds for glass ornaments may well be similar to others that were employed for this composition. Pausanias records that the god's sceptre was inlaid with all kinds of metals, while the throne was made of ebony and ivory, gold and precious stones. It seems very probable that some of the decorative effects were achieved using moulded, coloured glass and perhaps enamels. One might compare some interesting architectural examples of the use of decorative glass beads set into stone in the later part of the 5th century BC. There is evidence to show that the Ionic capitals of the north porch of the Erechtheion in Athens were adorned in this way. Light and dark blue, violet, yellow and perhaps brown and red were used there. A similar arrangement probably adorned the sculptured mouldings of the base of the statue of Nemesis at Rhamnous.1013 Some of the drapery folds have been identified as coming from the cloth on the upper arms of a figure, others from the lower part of a chiton (Fig. 1 1.25). The folds which are thought to come from the lower part of a chiton are rather flat.1014 Schiering believes that moulded glass sheets, made from glass imported from the east, were employed as a cover for much thinner gold sheets, perhaps gold foil. If this were the case, it would mean that a very new approach to the production of chryselephantine statuary had been taken in Olympia. In support of his theory, Schiering points to finds in the so-called tomb of Philip II at Vergina, possibly dating from 336 BC. In both the main chamber and the 1010 Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII.49-50.

From the evidence of finds made in other tombs, Andronikos has suggested that the wooden furniture was sheathed in ivory, and that it was adorned with ivory reliefs as well as figured decorations embossed on sheets of gold. Transparent glass plaques, some of which survive, were attached over the gold sheets in order to embellish and protect them.1015 Schiering has tentatively suggested that the glass drapery fragments belonged either to a seated figure, perhaps the Mother Goddess in the Olympian Metroon, or to a flying figure, such as the Pheidian Nike in Zeus's right hand, whose movement would perhaps have caused the drapery to be swept back against the legs and, therefore, to appear quite flat.1016 The Metroon was built at the very end of the 5th century BC. Pausanias makes no mention of this statue but, as Schiering says, Pausanias may not have seen it for it might have been destroyed in the earthquake which hit the area shortly after the middle of the 1 st century BC.1017 Nothing is known about the appearance of the Mother Goddess statue, so this possibility remains unverifiable. As far as the Nike is concerned, the scale of the glass fragments is problematic and the evidence is not yet strong enough to be conclusive.1018 At present, none of the drapery moulds found at Olympia can be attributed with certainty to the Pheidian composition. It nevertheless remains possible that the techniques they imply were very similar to those employed to make the Zeus. Glass is thought to have been made for the first time in Mesopotamia, perhaps as early as the 3rd millennium BC. The raw materials required to make a stable glass were easily available, and ancient craftsmen experimented with colorants in order to produce glasses of many different hues. Prior to the discovery, in the 1st century BC, that glass could be blown, the main methods for producing glass objects involved shaping them around a solid core or moulding them. The processes involved were time-consuming and they demanded skilled craftsmen. For hundreds of years, therefore, glass was regarded as something very precious and rare, and its use seems to have been limited to the production of small vessels and ornaments. There is as yet very little evidence in Greece for glass workshops, though Rhodes is known to have been an important centre for this industry over a long period. Rather than producing their own glass from raw materials, it seems that in early times the Greeks imported glass in the form of solid ingots from places such as Egypt, the near and middle east, or Rhodes. They then remelted it or carved it.1019 In the Mycenaean period, glass was a highly prized material and it was widely used in the Aegean to make jewellery. Moulds from this period have been found, along with objects made from the moulds. These finds prove that the same moulds were often used to make not only glass ornaments but also gold foil ornaments. The glass ornaments of this period are often of a deep translucent blue or green. They were regarded as valuable and beautiful in their own right, and sometimes they were used on their own to contrast with the gold 1015 Andronikos (1984) 122-24, 176-77, figs. 140-42. 1016 Schiering (1991) 142-45. 1017 Schiering (1991) 144 n. 102. 1018 See discussion in section 3, above. 1019 For a general introduction on the subject of glass production, see Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna (2000) 14-16, and Davidson Weinberg (1992) 15ff.</page><page sequence="365">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 347 ornaments. But traces of glass inside some gold foil ornaments provide evidence that glass was also used in order to back the gold foil and strengthen it. Some of these objects come from Olympia.1020 During the Aegean 'Dark Ages' many crafts, including glass-working, fell into decline. But the old techniques did not die out completely, for objects made using those techniques have been found from the 9th century BC onwards. There is as yet very little evidence for clear, almost colourless moulded glass dating from the 430s BC. The earliest known reference to glass drinking cups was made by Aristophanes in 425 BC. Aristophanes describes the cups as made of glass and gold. The context suggests that drinking glasses were not unheard of in Athens, but that they were still considered rare and valuable enough to conjure up the extravagance of the Persian way of life.1021 Apart from the glass from the moulds at Olympia, the earliest known objects of clear glass are bowls and cups from graves dating from the last years of the century which have been discovered in various parts of Greece, including Rhodes, Salónica and Veroia. Considering how little is yet known about glass in Classical Greece, it is possible that the decorative techniques used in the 4th century BC at Vergina already existed in the later part of the 5th century BC and that they were used on the Pheidian Zeus, as Schiering has suggested. This theory, however, still faces several difficulties. Pausanias, who saw the statue in the 2nd century AD, states that it was made of ivory and gold, and it is difficult to believe that 5th century BC glass would have been transparent enough to go completely unnoticed by Pausanias. One possibility is that coloured glass ornaments were inserted alongside the gold drapery of the statue of Zeus, as Lapatin suggests.1022 There does not seem to be any direct proof, as yet, that the moulded glass was used in conjunction with gold sheets. But, if it was, it is perhaps equally possible that the glass was employed behind the gold rather than in front of it, in order to strengthen it, as used to be done in earlier times. The moulds might have been used to create both the gold and the glass layers. It should be noted that, unlike the glass from the Olympian moulds, the glass found at Vergina is in flat plaques, so that the outer surface does not follow the contours of the gold foil decoration lying beneath it. 11.6. THE ZEUS AT OLYMPIA AS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD The canonical list of the seven wonders of the ancient world, as it is known today, comprises the following works: the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Zeus at Olympia, the Artemision at Ephesos, the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos, the Colossus of Rhodes and the Pharos at Alexandria. The available sources show that the list only reached its final form very gradually, over a period of many hundreds of years. The lists that have come down to us vary considerably in content, disagreeing both about the number and the identity of the wonders of the world. The original idea behind such lists 1020 Harden (1981) 39^0. 1021 Aristophanes, Acharnians, 74. WZ2 Lapatin (2001) 82.</page><page sequence="366">348 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS was to name human works most worth seeing in the world. It was only gradually that these theamata became the seven thaumata , that is, works to be marvelled at, regardless of whether or not they were still in existence at the time of writing. One of the earliest surviving lists which includes seven wonders in almost exactly the form in which we know them today, the only difference being that the Pharos is excluded and the Walls of Babylon are included, is that of Antipater.1023 He was writing around 120 BC. It is probable that this list was compiled using an earlier source. Indeed a date for the origins of the wonders lists in the 3rd century BC is suggested by the inclusion of the Colossus of Rhodes, which was created some time after 305 BC and collapsed in the great earthquake of 226 BC. It has been suggested that Antipater's source was the 3rd century BC writer Kallimachos of Cyrene (305-240 BC). He is known to have written a work on wonders of the world. Unfortunately, this work is now lost. The fact that the Pharos of Alexandria eventually became part of the canonical list too perhaps reinforces the idea of a 3rd century BC origin for the lists of wonders: the Pharos was built during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphos (284-246 BC). This was the latest work to be included in the canonical list, being mentioned for the first time in the extant sources by Gregory of Tours, writing in the 6th century AD. Despite the general lack of consensus in the sources concerning the contents of the list of wonders, the Zeus at Olympia by Pheidias is one of the works which is generally included. It appears in the earliest known source, Antipater, as well as two sources of the 4th century AD which seem to be modelled on Antipater: Gregorios Nazianzenos, Anth. Pal. 8.177, and Pseudo Philon of Byzantium, De septem orbis spectaculis. Hyginus, writing in the 2nd century AD, includes the statue, and so do Ampelius, of the 2nd or 3rd century AD, Vibius Sequester, of the 4th or 5th century AD, and Cassiodorus of the 6th century AD. It also appears in various anonymous lists of unknown, but probably not very late, date. By contrast, in the latest group of sources with wonder lists, including such authors as Gregory of Tours, Niketas, Pseudo-Bede and Kedrenos, the Zeus does not appear, apart from in the exceptional thirty-wonder list, the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 989, which may have been compiled by Eustathios in the 12th century AD. The Zeus at Olympia remained undisturbed in its sanctuary for hundreds of years after it was completed and countless people came to visit it there. It was regarded as one of life's great misfortunes never to have seen the Zeus at Olympia1024 and its impact on visitors was enormous. When Lucius Aemilius Paullus visited the sanctuary at Olympia he is said to have commented that the reality far exceeded his already high expectations.1025 Apart from the Colossus of Rhodes, it is the only statue to be included in the list of wonders. Though less than half the size of the Colossus, at over 12m high the statue of Zeus would have been a striking sight. Because it was a seated figure, it would have been substantially larger in scale than the comparably tall Athena Parthenos at Athens which was a standing figure. Beyond its mere size, the design and workmanship of the statue ensured its place in the list of world wonders. Lavishly wrought in the richest materials, every part of the work was adorned with reliefs or paintings or incised details which transformed the Zeus from a simple statue into a veritable pattern-book as well as a compendium of Greek myths.

Epict. 1.6.23. 1025 Polybios, XXX. 10.6.</page><page sequence="367">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 349 amount of detail on the statue must have been a source of endless fascination for the viewer and it was partly this that gave the Zeus such a great reputation. Pheidias's ability to bring together work on a colossal scale with minute attention to detail is certainly a quality which Pliny comments upon, in relation to the great Athena Parthenos at Athens.1026 The information concerning the statue which is to be found in the brief descriptions of the wonder lists is, on the whole, not very interesting and quite often incorrect. Usually, the information is limited to authorship, material, location and sometimes size. The measurements given vary considerably. Anonymus Taurinensis, 1, underestimates the size, saying the statue was 16 cubits high, but most writers overestimate: Anonymus Paradoxographus gives the rather large figure of 36 cubits; Hyginus says it measured 60ft; Vibius Sequester gives the Zeus the fantastic height of 100ft; and Anonymus Taurinensis, 2 exaggerates grossly, saying it measured 100 cubits. Ampelius seems to have misunderstood the source he was using and he gives the measurements of the temple as if they were those of the statue! The sources usually simply say that the statue was made of ivory and gold, with no information concerning the technique, but two of them state that it was made of 'hammered' gold.1027 Most detailed is the paragraph by Pseudo-Philon, and it is here that one finds expressed the most important justification, as far as the ancients were concerned, for the inclusion of this statue in the list of wonders. Pheidias's skill had managed to produce not only a marvellous piece of art but at the same time an image of Zeus which succeeded in embodying people's vision of this great deity. As Philon puts it, 'we marvel at the rest of the seven wonders, this one we worship'.1028 This is a view which one finds expressed again and again in the sources for the Zeus at Olympia, and it was surely Pheidias's ability to achieve this feat which earned him such universal admiration. The Zeus was regarded by many as the very portrait of the Zeus imagined by Homer.1029 It was also regarded as a 'truly divine and blessed image of the god'1030 and one which 'seems to have added something even to received religion, so exactly does the majesty of the work measure up to the god'.1031 11.7. THE LATER HISTORY OF THE ZEUS AND ITS INFLUENCE The first recorded damage to the statue of Zeus at Olympia happened in the earlier part of the 2nd century BC. Pausanias, IV.31.6, mentions that Damophon of Messene was asked to repair cracks to the ivory. It is believed that the damage may have resulted from an earthquake which shook the sanctuary in 183 BC. Damophon was a famous and highly respected artist of the Peloponnese, who was reaching the end of his career when he was 1026 Pliny, NH 36.15-19. 1027 Gregorios Nazianzenos, Anth.

XII. 10.9.</page><page sequence="368">350 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS asked to carry out this important work. Pausanias records that he was honoured by the people of Elis for his efforts. According to Hieronymus and Eusebios, the statue was struck by lightning in 52 BC, an improbable event considering that the statue was indoors. Pausanias says that lightning struck a spot near the statue in the time of Pheidias, shortly after he had completed the statue; the lightning was supposed to have been a sign of approval for the statue sent by Zeus in answer to Pheidias' s prayer.1032 One wonders whether lightning did in fact strike anywhere near the Zeus or whether these reports are the fabrication of imaginative guides. In AD 40, the Zeus narrowly missed being transported to Rome by Caligula and having its face remodelled to portray that of the Emperor. Caligula apparently built a temple for the god on the Palatine and he was planning to build a bridge from there across to his own palace on the Capitoline. In order to achieve his goal, he wanted to have the statue of Zeus taken apart and shipped across to Rome, a delicate and highly complex feat of engineering. This ambition was never fulfilled. Josephus reports that Memmius, the man in charge of transporting the statue, was warned by his engineers that if the Zeus was moved it would be destroyed. Added to this, terrifying portents seemed to issue from the statue, so Memmius decided to delay the transfer.1033 Not long afterwards, Caligula was assassinated. When Pausanias saw the statue in the mid 2nd century AD he noticed that one of the eight figures on the bar between the front legs of Zeus' s throne was completely indistinct, but he says he does not know for what reason. This bar was sculptured with boys taking part in what Pausanias thought could be archaic contests.1034 Also writing in the 2nd century AD, Lucian twice mentions the theft of locks of hair, presumably golden, from the head of Zeus.1035 In one of the passages, he is quite specific, saying that two locks were taken, each one weighing six pounds. It was probably towards the end of the 4th century or, at the latest, in the early 5th century AD, that the moment of crisis came for the Zeus at Olympia. The first law against pagan sacrifices had been passed in AD 321, and others followed. In the AD 360s and 370s, first under Julian the Apostate and then under the fairly tolerant co-emperors Valentian I and Valens, probably some freedom was allowed to pagans, but under Theodosios I (he died in AD 395) this situation changed. Temples were destroyed in unauthorized attacks that were carried out with impunity. In AD 382, Theodosios ordered that pagan temples be kept open if they contained valuable sculptures, but ten years later he decreed that all pagan temples be closed and pagan cults made illegal. Later imperial decrees make it clear that the orders of Theodosios were not carried out uniformly throughout the Empire and evidence shows that they were particularly unsuccessful in, for instance, Athens. Nevertheless, the Zeus at Olympia cannot have remained in its temple long after the time of Theodosios I, for the temple of Zeus at Olympia was extensively damaged by fire in AD 425. This provides a firm terminus ante quem for the removal of the statue. The Zeus was taken to Constantinople, where it was housed in the Palace of 1032 Pausanias, V.11.9. 1033 Josephus, Ant. lud. 19.1. See also Suetonius, Cal ., 57.1. 1034 Pausanias, V.ll. 3. 1035 Jup. Trag. 25, and Timon , 4.</page><page sequence="369">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 351 Lausos. A more specific date for the removal cannot be provided either by the suppression of the Olympic Games, traditionally held to be in AD 393, or by the edict of AD 408, stating that any statue still being worshipped in its temple must be removed. The edict of AD 408 is known to have been contravened in other places (for example, the Parthenon and the Asklepieion at Athens) and the evidence for the date of the abolition of the Olympic Games is now being called into question. Unfortunately for the Zeus, its move to Constantinople did not preserve it for very long, for the Lauseion was gutted by a great fire in AD 475. 1036 Nevertheless, during the period that the statue presided over the great apsidal hall of sculptures in the Palace of Lausos, it had enormous influence.1037 For there is no doubt that the iconography of the statue was assimilated into Christian art by the 6th century AD, the image of the Zeus inspiring that of the bearded Christ Pantocrator.1038 The chryselephantine Zeus is described by Kedrenos as being made of ivory. This is perhaps due to the fact that any gold had been removed by the time the statue came to Constantinople. This idea seems to be supported by Kedrenos's description of the 'green' Athena Lindia in the same passage: there is evidence that it too was once covered in gold.1039 The fact that the Zeus could still be considered a great work of art even when its gold revetment was missing, and that it continued to be a powerful source of inspiration until its destruction in AD 475, suggests that the wooden core of the statue was a fully fledged wooden sculpture of Zeus, lacking only the final details and colour. The sources mention several copies or versions of the great Zeus at Olympia made in ancient times. Pausanias describes an almost contemporary work, modelled on the Zeus, that was started by Theokosmos of Megara, supposedly with Pheidias's assistance.1040 The head was made of ivory and gold and the rest of plaster and terracotta. It is probable that the unfinished statue was an acrolith. Pausanias also saw bits of wood lying behind the temple which he says were half-worked. He assumes that these too belonged to the statue and that they were intended by the artist to be covered in ivory and gold. It seems most unlikely, however, that any wood found lying around behind the temple could have been as old as Pausanias imagined. From Megarian coins of the Imperial age, it can be seen that the iconography of the Megarian statue was strongly influenced by the chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia: Zeus was seated on a throne, with a himation draped around his legs, the left hand holding a sceptre, the right bearing a Nike upon it.1041 Pausanias says that the Seasons and Fates were depicted above the head of Zeus. These were probably carved on the top of the throne back in the same place as the Seasons and Graces figured in the Olympian composition. The work was interrupted by the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides reports that the first incursion into Megarian territory by 1036 Kedrenos, 1.616. 1037 For details about the possible arrangement of the sculptures in the Lauseion see notes to Kedrenos, Comp.

So work must have been started some time before 431 BC. Krause has put forward the view that the 4th century BC statue of Asklepios at Epidauros, by Thrasymedes of Paros, was dependent on the Zeus at Olympia of Pheidias (Fig. 11. 26). 1043 The Epidaurean statue has been recognized on local coins, one group dating from the second half of the 4th century BC, another from the 2nd century AD.1044 According to Pausanias, the statue was chryselephantine and it showed Asklepios sitting on a throne, which was adorned with carvings of various mythological subjects. In one hand he held a staff, while the other hand rested on the head of a serpent, and a dog lay beside him. Pausanias also says that the statue was half the size of the Zeus at Olympia. From the coins one can add that the god's legs were draped, but not his torso; that his left hand grasped the staff, while the right forearm was stretched out with the hand resting on the snake. On the coins the seat is sometimes shown simply as a stool, and the dog appears to lie beneath it. There does not seem to have been a footstool. A copy of the statue type seen on the coins is thought to have been identified in a statue fragment in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen.1045 The fragment comprises the upper part of the statue, from the hip, and includes the outstretched right arm and most of the bearded face. The statue comes from Tusculum in Italy and has been dated to the Antonine period. A complete version of the same type can be seen in another statue in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek which was found in Campania and is also Imperial.1046 Krause is of the opinion that it was because the Zeus and Asklepios statues were so similar that there was some confusion about the authorship of the Epidaurean statue even in antiquity.1047 Athenagoras, Leg. pro Christ. 17.4, ascribes the work to Pheidias. He is followed by Libanios, Or. 30, writing in the 4th century AD, and by the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 989 , which probably dates from the 13th century AD. But the words of Athenagoras may not carry a great deal of weight in this argument, for he was a Christian apologist of the 2nd century AD and he might be excused for not knowing a great deal about Classical sculpture. Krause thinks that the similarity between the two works has also led modern scholars to ascribe to Pheidias 's statue sculpture which may belong to that of Thrasymedes.1048 Although the Zeus and Asklepios statues shared the same technique and a fairly similar pose, it is not clear that they were as close as Krause maintains. From the evidence of the coins, a major difference in pose appears to be that the left hand of the Asklepios statue was set fairly high up the staff, with the arm held away from the body, slightly to the side. The pose of the upper body was also less rigid and erect than that of the Pheidian Zeus. Asklepios is seen in profile on the coins and the torso is shown in 1042 Thucydides, II.31.1. 1043 Krause (1972) 240ff. 1044 The work is described by Pausanias in II.27.2. 1045 Inv. 1425, cat. no. 90; Holzmann (1984) no. 44. 1046 Inv. 1683, cat. no. 93.

Since the left arm is held away from the body it does not obscure the view of the torso from the side. This suggests that the designer of the statue was trying to create other views of the work in addition to the fully frontal. Thrasymedes was clearly familiar with the Pheidian image, but his style belongs to the 4th century BC. The more relaxed, more open pose of the Asklepios statue, as seen on local coins, is similar to that of a seated Zeus which started to appear on the reverse of coins issued by Philip of Macedón and then his son, Alexander the Great. Zeus is shown sitting on a throne or a stool, sometimes with a footstool beneath his feet. His lower body is loosely draped in a himation. On his outstretched right hand he holds an eagle, while his raised left hand grasps the sceptre (Fig. 1 1.27). Philip and Alexander both used this image of the supreme god, which was surely a free interpretation of the Pheidian Zeus, as a political symbol of Macedonian hegemony in Greece. It continued to be used by some of the Hellenistic rulers well into the 3rd century BC. The image was then dropped until about a century later, when the Seleucid ruler Antiochos IV Epiphanes, who ruled from 175 to 164 BC, started to use it once again. After the first issue of his reign, Antiochos abandoned the traditional image of a seated Apollo on his coins and introduced that of the seated Zeus instead. On the coins Zeus is shown sitting on a stool, with a himation falling over his left upper arm and covering his lower body. His right arm is outstretched, with Nike upon the hand, and the left arm is held up to grasp the sceptre. It is also turned a little way out to the side. Zeus sits up straight and looks ahead. As well as the seated Zeus image, Antiochos also used images of the bearded head of Zeus and the head of Apollo on his coins. Antiochos IV identified himself with both Zeus and Apollo.1049 His special interest in Zeus, which one infers from the introduction of the image of Zeus on his coins, is also apparent from the fact that he resumed work on the Olympieion at Athens. It is possible that the coin representations of the seated Zeus reflect a statue set up at Daphne by Antiochos. Ammianus Marcellinus states that in AD 362 the temple of Apollo at Daphne and the image inside it, which had been set up by Antiochos IV, were burnt to the ground by a great fire.1050 According to Ammianus, the image was as big as the Zeus at Olympia. It is not clear from his text whether Ammianus thought the image was a copy of the Zeus, as Bieber assumes.1051 It is likely that the statue was influenced by the Pheidian Zeus, even if only indirectly. As Vlizos has demonstrated in his study of enthroned figures of Zeus from the late Classical and Hellenistic periods, numerous statues of this sort were produced and, although many of them bear a superficial resemblance to the Olympian Zeus, it is in fact very difficult to trace the relationships between the different sorts of seated figures that exist and to evaluate the influence of any one statuary type.1052 Vlizos has identified five different schemes for statues of the enthroned Zeus, all of them more relaxed and more open in their pose than the Pheidian Zeus, and none of them, he believes, are directly dependent on the Pheidian Zeus. The differences between the statues he discusses are great enough to suggest that mediator works have to be assumed for the majority of the copies. 1049 See Fleischer (1991) 50. 1050 Ammianus Marcellinus, Res gestae , XXII. 13. 1051 Bieber (1981) 157. 1052 Vlizos (1999) 118.</page><page sequence="372">354 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Since the statues are only indirectly connected to each other, based on lost prototypes, he describes the various groups as 'schemes' rather than 'types'. The closest scheme to the Pheidian Zeus is the so-called Lyon scheme, discussed in section 2 above, which is thought to be based on an Attic prototype of the first quarter of the 4th century BC. In this case an iconographical connection with the Pheidian Zeus can be seen in the arrangement of the drapery and the strong, erect pose. But, unlike the Pheidian Zeus, the scheme is not fully frontal for the left arm is brought out to the side. This movement opens the pose a little and allows one to view the statue from the side as well as from the front.1053 The so- called Rome scheme introduces further changes and innovations to the iconography of the seated Zeus.1054 Probably based on a statue type of the late 4th century BC, perhaps from Attica, the Rome scheme shows some connection with the Olympian Zeus in the arrangement of the himation, but the pose is quite different. The left arm is turned out to the side, as in the Lyon scheme, and the right arm rests on the right thigh holding a thunderbolt. The right shoulder is lowered and the head is slightly lowered and turned to the right. Dating from the second and first centuries BC, three further schemes for the seated Zeus are distinguished by Vlizos but in none of these can an iconographical link be made with the Olympian Zeus despite superficial similarities.1055 Their more natural and spontaneous poses lack the stiffness displayed by the Pheidian Zeus and in none of these is the drapery arranged in the same manner. These schemes are thought to have originated in Asia Minor. An important Roman statue which may have been influenced by the Olympian Zeus was that of Jupiter Optimus Maximus for the temple on the Capitolium in Rome, a tripartite temple with cellae for Minerva, Juno and Jupiter. During its history this temple suffered several fires and had to be rebuilt three times.1056 Martin believes that the cult image of Jupiter was completely destroyed in each fire and, therefore, that after the 1053 Vlizos (1999) 14-15, 122ff. 1U^ Vlizos (1999) 128-129. 1U3^ Schemes 'Malibu', 'Pergamon' and 'Konya'; Vlizos (1999) 129^2. 1056 The temple and its ancient terracotta cult images by Vulca of Veii, which included a standing figure of Jupiter, were destroyed by a fire in 85 BC (Lugli (1952-65) VIII, 17, 4, 126-35, and Martin (1985) 131-44). Vulca's image of Jupiter had shown the god holding a thunderbolt in one hand and a sceptre in the other. His face had been coloured red and he had apparently been draped in real garments, a purple mantle embroidered in gold thread over an embroidered tunic. When the temple burned down, Sulla had a new, marble temple built on its ruins in 83 BC, and the new cult image of Jupiter was dedicated by Q. Lutatius Catulus in 69 BC (Suetonius, Caes. 15). This building of the Republican era lasted until AD 69, when it too was destroyed by fire in the riots of the time of Vitellius (Tacitus, Hist. 3.71). Vespasian (emperor from AD 69-79) had the temple rebuilt, but it burned down yet again in AD 80 (Tacitus, Hist. 4.53; Dio Cocc., LXVI.24). Rebuilding was soon started, and a fourth temple, by the architect Rabirius, was inaugurated in AD 89, in the reign of Domitian (emperor from AD 81-96). The building had marble columns and the gilding of the temple alone, according to Plutarch, cost more than twelve thousand talents (Plutarch, Publicóla 15.3-4). This temple remained one of the glories of Rome for much of the 6th century AD, until Narses pulled down most of its statuary in around AD 571 (Cassiodorus, Var. VII.6.1.

Maderna suggests that a statue in Leningrad, dating from Flavian times and measuring over 3m in height, could be a version of the Vespasianic cult statue.1063 It seems highly probable that all three cult statues followed a similar scheme. The so-called Jupiter Verospi, which shows Jupiter in a closely similar pose to the Vespasianic image, probably provides a reliable image of the latest cult statue, for it is thought to date from the 3rd century AD.1064 A marble torso from the temple of Jupiter at Pompeii, dating from some time after 80 BC, which again follows the same scheme, is probably a copy of the Republican image.1065 The material and the iconography of the Jupiter Optimus Maximus statue, which can be deduced from the sources, have led to the association with the Zeus at Olympia, which was so admired in Roman times.1066 But Maderna argues that the Capitoline statues were different from the Pheidian Zeus in that they depended upon the Hellenistic idea of Zeus, which had also been used on coins of Alexander the Great.1067 As discussed above, this 1057 Martin (1987). 1U3Ö Commentary on Plato's Timaios, 337. 1059 Stewart (1990) 230. 1060 So Jucker (1950) 137 n. 1, 138 n.l; Martin (1987) 134-35, and Richardson (1992) 22 Iff. 1061 Josephus, Ant. lud. 19.11; Suetonius, Caligula , 52; cf.

Not only had the style changed since the time when the Olympian Zeus was created but so too had the implications carried by the statues, which were affected by the image and role of Alexander in the Hellenistic period. From the time of Augustus, Roman emperors were often represented as Jupiter. Maderna follows Niemeyer in believing that the Capitoline image of Jupiter was the inspiration for numerous seated emperors but that there was no specific statuary prototype for the Roman image.1068 Vlizos suggests that it was perhaps influenced by an early first century BC statuary scheme for the seated Zeus, best exemplified by a statue in Konya.1069 Despite the reservations of these scholars, it is still surely true to say that the Zeus at Olympia influenced the appearance of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Not only was the image gilded, and probably in the chryselephantine technique, but it also drew freely on the pose of the seated, bearded god in Olympia. In the Hellenistic period, with Alexander the Great, the image of the seated god started to take on a new meaning as secular ruler and later, in the Imperial period, it became the unmistakable symbol for the ruler as god. The Pheidian image, by being the most important and famous image of the supreme god, cannot have been less than an indirect inspiration, at the very least, for the appearance of the great statue of Jupiter in Rome.1070 On the Capitolium there was another important statue of Zeus, but nothing is known of its appearance, except that it was colossal. It was the work of Myron and it originally stood on one base with statues of Athena and Herakles in a hypaethral Heraion in Samos.1071 Anthony removed these statues, but Augustus Caesar restored two of them, transferring the Zeus to the Capitolium where he had a special little temple built for it. Josephus mentions the cult statues of Augustus Caesar and Roma in a temple in Caesarea Palestinae. 1072 The city, previously known as Strato 's Tower, had been removed from Jewish control by Pompey in 63 BC and attached to Syria. Octavian returned it to Herod the Great in 30 BC, and in the period from 22 BC to 10 BC, Herod completely rebuilt the city and renamed it in honour of the Emperor. The cult statues are likened by Josephus to two colossal chryselephantine masterpieces of Greek Classical sculpture: the Zeus at Olympia by Pheidias and the Hera at Argos by Polykleitos. It is not known exactly how similar to these two works the Herodian statues were. The image of Augustus Caesar is said to resemble the Olympian Zeus and both statues were thought to be as 1068 Niemeyer (1968) 59. 1069 Konya, Yalvac Museum, 40; Vlizos (1999) 138-39, no. Kl, pl. 24,2. 1070 A related image can be seen on an Eleusinian wall painting, of which the present location is not known. The fresco presents a seated Zeus wrapped in a grey himation with a green border which is draped round his legs and carried behind and over his left shoulder. He is holding a golden Nike in one hand and a sceptre in the other. Zeus wears sandals on his feet which rest on a stool. Despite the more relaxed and more open pose, the influence of the Zeus at Olympia can be felt here. But Krause (1984) 26 n. 133 asks whether the figure might in fact be a copy of the statue of Zeus in the Athenian Olympieion. 1071 Strabo, Geogr. 14.1.14, 637b. lu/¿ Josephus, Bell. lud. 1.414.</page><page sequence="375">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 357 splendid as the Classical works mentioned. There is no indication about the material in which they were made but it is possible that they too were chryselephantine. If this is true, then they represent rare examples of replicas of colossal Classical statues. It is probable that the two cult statues shared a similar scale, as they were placed together in the same temple. In this respect they cannot have followed their Classical predecessors exactly for, while the statue of Zeus is known to have reached to the roof of his temple and measured around 12.3 m, the statue of Hera, whose height has been estimated from the size of her temple, is thought to have been little bigger than half the size of the Zeus. Gruben gives the measurements of the stylobate of the temple of Zeus at Olympia as 27.68m by 64.12m, and those of the stylobate of the second temple of Hera at Argos as 17.30m by 36.90m. 1073 Both these statues bear witness to the popularity of Classical works in Roman times, and they show again how widespread was the influence of Pheidias's work. Unfortunately, there is no sculptural or numismatical evidence for these works, but it would not be surprising to discover that they were made in the neo-Classical style, which was the style preferred by the Romans for their cult images.1074 It is often said that Damophon of Messene can be classed as an exponent of the neo- Classical style, consciously reviving the Classical style of Pheidias. Damophon is famed for having repaired Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia in the early 2nd century BC. He often employed a technique that has been associated with the chryselephantine, which involved the piecing together of marble statues from many smaller parts.1075 He also seems to have specialized in the depiction of heroes and divinities. New finds from Messene, however, analyzed and compared with the works already known from Lykosoura, prove that such a classification of his style is misplaced.1076 In addition, they shed new light on both the dates of Damophon 's activity and its extent. Taking the second point first, much new information about Damophon has been gathered recently from the restoration of a Doric column bearing an inscription, which probably stood originally in front of the heroon in Messene that was erected in honour of Damophon after his death.1077 From the inscription, which preserves the decrees of seven cities honouring Damophon, several important facts emerge. It is now clear that Damophon was not just a local artist, as previously thought.1078 The inscription shows that he was known and appreciated beyond the Peloponnese in western Lokris, the Ionian islands of Lefkada and Kefallenia as well as in the Cycladic islands of Kythnos and Melos. The epigraphical evidence also clearly demonstrates that his floruit was earlier than generally thought: it coincided with the last decades of the 3rd century BC and the first of the 2nd century BC at the latest, a period when his native city of Messene enjoyed a brief 1073 Gruben (1976) 55 and 107. 1074 So Polliti (1986) 162-63. 1075 So Bieber (1981) 158. 1076 Themelis (1994) 2ff. 1077 Themelis (1994) 24-26. 1078 Smith (1991) 240.</page><page sequence="376">358 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS flowering too, before being forced into joining the Achaean League.1079 Thus Damophon's work in Olympia came at the end, rather than at the beginning, of his career. In a general sense, the debt to Pheidias can be felt in Damophon's works, which continued the tradition of mainland Greece of using the Classical idiom for temple statues. And yet, to say with Stewart that the Classicism of Damophon was directly inspired by Pheidias or that he was consciously reproducing 5th century BC schemes, goes against the available evidence.1080 While using Classical grandeur to shape his gods as, for instance, in the depiction of facial forms, Damophon incorporated all the vivacity and movement of Hellenistic baroque in his works: impressionistic modelling of hair and drapery, expressive facial features, and complicated figure poses are all important elements of Damophon's art. If neo-Classicism can be defined as "the use of fifth century style as a self-conscious aesthetic reference", as Smith puts it, then Damophon's lively mixture of old-fashioned and contemporary forms cannot be described as neo-Classical.1081 In addition, Themelis points to the strong debt in Damophon's works to artists of the 4th century BC and the early Hellenistic sculptors who carried on their work.1082 In particular, and especially in association with Damophon's multi-figure groups, Themelis mentions Praxiteles and Skopas and their schools. Consider, for example, the Lykosoura statues, representing the seated figures of Despoina and her mother Demeter, framed by the standing figures of Anytos and Artemis. The group composition is old-fashioned in conception for the figures are placed in a row and there is very little depth. But we may note that the Anytos head, for instance, combines a Classical facial form with a 'modern' hairstyle with irregular locks. The head of Artemis too shows strong classicistic elements, while the head of Demeter is much closer to Damophon's head of Herakles at Messene (Inv. 3337), which Themelis describes as "little influenced by the austerity of Classicism."1083 Another sculptor who should be considered in connection with the question of the reemergence of the Classical style in Hellenistic times is the Athenian, Eukleides. In all handbooks on the subject he appears as the creator of an acrolithic head of a bearded god from Aigeira, generally seen as a version of Pheidias's image of Zeus at Olympia.1084 This is based on the original excavator's readiness to accept his find as identical with the cult statue of Zeus by Eukleides, a work mentioned by Pausanias.1085 The bearded head was found in a small building near the theatre of Aigeira. Walter later found the left arm of the same statue and part of the middle finger of the right hand nearby. While the theatre and the small building, known as naïskos D, have now been dated to the 3rd century BC on the basis of ceramic and numismatic evidence, it is generally agreed that the sculptures belong to the 2nd century BC. As Smith has noted, "the impressive head captures the 1079 Livy, XXXVI.31.9. 1080 Stewart (1990) 82. 1 r' o 1 1UÖ1 Smith (1991) 241. 1082 Themelis (1994) 35. 1083 Themelis (1994) 19. 1084 So Bieber (1981) 158-59; Pollitt (1986) 166; Stewart (1990) 221; Smith (1991) 240; and Trümmer (1993) 141-55. 1085 waiter (1919) 1-14; (1931) 146-52.

The surface is hard, the eyes and lips sharply cut in a Classical manner."1086 The conscious choice of a style and technique which draw on earlier, Classical traditions characterizes the classicistic approach. Madigan has challenged the authorship and identity of the head.1087 Madigan believes that Eukleides must be identified with a 4th century BC sculptor, the 'stone-cutter' mentioned in Plato's will, who owed the philosopher three minai.1088 The view that the Aigeira head is not the one described by Pausanias as being by Eukleides finds support in the fact that Pausanias says the cult statue by Eukleides was entirely made of marble, whereas the head and arm from Aigeira are made in the acrolithic technique.1089 Madigan argues that there are strong reasons for believing that the deity in question is Dionysos rather than Zeus. The fleshy forms of the face, the style of the hair and the fact that the head was originally dressed with a bronze wreath all point to Dionysos. From the remains of the arm and neck Madigan concludes that the figure was fully draped, perhaps in a chiton and mantle. The proximity of the 'naiskos' to the theatre - a matter of some twenty metres - also suggests that Dionysos was the god worshipped in this place. Whereas there are several Peloponnesian examples, including nearby Aigion and Sikyon, of temples to Dionysos set near a theatre, it is very rare to find the same arrangements for Zeus. Furthermore, the enframing motifs of the pebble mosaic set in front of the image are very Dionysian: they include griffins, kantharoi, and thyrsoi. From the size of the Aigeira head, which is three times life-size, in relation to that of the temple (18.75m by 8.30m), Madigan infers that the god was represented seated. All the indications about the appearance of the statue, as well as the clear similarities between the plan and proportions of this little temple and the 4th century BC temple of Dionysos near the theatre in Athens, which housed a chryselephantine image of Dionysos,1090 lead Madigan to the conclusion that the Aigeira temple and statue probably represented a deliberate later attempt to "emulate the famous temple and statue in Athens".1091 Thus the Aigeira statue would be an acrolithic copy in classicizing style of a famous chryselephantine work of the Classical period. The Codex Vaticanus Graecus 989 mentions an otherwise unknown chryselephantine Zeus attributed to Pheidias which was apparently in Berytos, in Syria. This work was possibly a copy of the Olympian statue, perhaps made in Hellenistic times. There may have been another copy in Cyprus which was in bronze with a golden face, though Ampelius' text is not clear and he may be referring to the original statue.1092 There is no sculptural or numismatical evidence for the statues which may have stood in Berytos and Cyprus. Confirmation of their existence would provide valuable evidence for the 1086 Smith (1991) 240. 1087 Madigan (1991) 503-10. 1088 Diogenes Laertius, III.42. 1089 Madigan (1991) 504-05. 1090 Pausanias 1.20.3. 1091 Madigan (1991) 508. i uvz Ampelius, Lib.

Pausanias tells of a chryselephantine statue made for the temple of Olympian Zeus at Athens by Hadrian.1093 This statue was probably finished in AD 131. It figures on Roman coins and, as far as one can judge from these, it appears to follow the Pheidian model.1094 Pausanias seems chiefly impressed by the technical brilliance of the statue given its great size, which he elsewhere says was double that of the Asklepios at Epidauros by Thrasymedes, and his lack of comment on the quality of the statue is eloquent.1095 Unfortunately for us, he gives no description of the statue's pose or general appearance either. But the comparison with the Asklepios statue at least strengthens the view that this was another seated representation of Zeus. In a recent work on classicism in the late 4th century AD, Kiilerich argues that the Pheidian image had some influence on the colossal portrait of Constantine made for his basilica in Rome.1096 From the enormous fragments in the courtyard of the Conservatori palace, as well as some new fragments, it can be deduced that this statue showed Constantine seated, his upper body undraped. The head, however, is unbearded. Kahler and L'Orange both argue that the drapery was made of bronze.1097 They disagree about the date of the image, Kahler arguing for AD 312-315 and L'Orange for AD 324-337. As Kiilerich writes, the attitude towards the formal language of Classical art was purely academic in the Constantinian period, and this was to be further emphasized in the following centuries.1098 As mentioned earlier, it seems certain that images of Christ from the Byzantine period show some resemblance to the Pheidian statue.1099 In particular, Justinian II coins of the so-called Type A, dating to AD 692-695 show Christ as "majestic, serene and benignly paternal" in a manner not dissimilar to the Pheidian Zeus (Fig. 1 1.28). One may compare the erect, and fully frontal pose of the bearded head.1100 The succeeding image of Christ, Type 'B', on Justinian's coins (AD 705-711) uses a highly geometric and abstract style. Whereas Type 'B' disappeared from Byzantine art, Type 'A' was taken over in the post- iconoclastic period and became the standard type for depictions of the supreme ruler in later Byzantine art.1101 1093 Pausanias, 1.18.6.

CATALOGUE (Al) ZEUS, whole figure 1. LYON STATUETTE Lyon, Musée Lapidaire. Statuette. H. 0.50m (0.62m with base). Parian marble. From Feurs in France. Early Antonine. The statuette is quite well preserved, though restorations include the neck, the left arm, the right lower arm, the front part of the right foot and much of the back support. The attribute held in the left hand, probably an upright sceptre, is missing. The head probably belongs to the piece. The inscription AllOAAQN on the plinth is modern. The upper body was cleaned in recent times. The statuette was discovered in the Château de la Batie at Feurs, ancient Forum Segusiavorum. It was in a private collection before coming to the museum. Zeus is shown seated on an imposing throne with a cloak covering his lower body and falling in a thick swathe over his left shoulder. His beard and hair are thick and his head is set upright, looking straight ahead. His right arm is lowered, the forearm brought forward and holding a globe, while the left forearm is raised. The drapery and pose of the figure accord with that of the Zeus at Olympia, as seen on Hadrianic coins which show the god in profile to the left. Characteristic features include the upturned right hand, the folds of drapery over the lap and the left shoulder, which leave the chest bare, and the very erect pose, with the right angle of the bent right arm echoing that formed by the upper body and the god's lap. Also characteristic are the placing of the feet on a footstool, with one leg drawn back, and the rectilinear design of the throne. But the statue diverges from the Pheidian type in several ways. The right lower leg is brought forwards, rather than being pulled in, as is the case on the coin images of the Pheidian Zeus. There are no long locks of hair descending on to the shoulders, as on the coin images, and the beard and hair are generally shorter. The left arm is brought out to the side, away from the confines of the throne, and the globe in the right hand replaces the Nike of the Pheidian type. The Lyon statuette is thought to follow a prototype of the first quarter of the 4th century BC which was iconographically closely related to the Pheidian Zeus. A feature which is typical of the Lyon statuette and which is repeated in other works based on the same prototype is the pattern of diagonal folds stretching from the left knee across to the right ankle. One may compare the statuettes in Rome, MNR 60922, and the Villa Albani, no. 426. The other statuary examples conforming to the Lyon scheme do not preserve the attribute of the right hand but, judging from the reliefs that employ this scheme, the attribute may have been a libation dish.1102 BIBLIOGRAPHY Schräder, H.

The raised left hand grasps an upright sceptre. Both feet rest on a footstool. But, as in the Lyon scheme, the right leg is set forwards, the left back, and the left arm is set out to the side. In addition, the right hand holds a dish. Unlike either the Pheidian Zeus or the Lyon scheme, the right forearm rests on the thigh rather than on the arm-rest. BIBLIOGRAPHY Despinis, G.

His thick beard, the arrangement of the himation, the raised left hand holding a sceptre, and the position of the legs, with the left set forwards, are all features reminiscent of the Pheidian Zeus. Differences include the low flat base on which the feet are set and the right forearm resting on the right thigh. The seat has a high back but no arm-rests. There are no locks of hair on the shoulders. The different angles of the torso and left arm show that the left arm was held out to the side following the Lyon scheme. BIBLIOGRAPHY Mitropoulou, E.

Late 5th century BC. Several large fragments of the bell krater survive, but many more are missing. The krater seems to have been smashed deliberately, after a ceremonial funerary feast. It was found scattered in small pieces over an area about 5m2, in 1882 by N. P. Kondakov, near Baksy in a kurgan about 10km north-east of Kerch, the ancient Greek colony of Pantikapaion, in the Crimea. It was brought to the Hermitage in the same year, but not studied in detail until B. Shefiton started work on it in 1968. It was published by Shefton in 1982. The main picture of the vase is divided into two registers, of which the upper register, which shows a group of gods in a line, is well preserved. In the centre of the scene is the seated figure of Zeus, clearly of similar type to the Zeus of Olympia by Pheidias. To the right of Zeus is the standing figure of Athena, bearing some of the characteristics of the Athena Parthenos and to his left is Hera. The scale of these three figures is slightly bigger than that of the other of the gods on either side. Zeus is seated on his throne, the lower</page><page sequence="390">372 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS body turned towards our left, the upper torso frontal, and the head turning to the right. His torso is naked, but his lower body is wrapped in a long, intricately embroidered cloak depicting running women, floral motifs and scroll patterns. Zeus wears sandals with white laces and his feet are set on an elaborate footstool, his left foot pivoting on its heel. On his head he wears a thick wreath with white berries amid the leaves, possibly a myrtle wreath. His bearded face, which tilts to his left side, looks decidedly worried. In his raised right hand he holds an upright sceptre. His left arm is bent and the clenched fist is brought to his left cheek in a gesture of unhappiness and mental agitation. Of his throne, one can see parts of the seat back, which is elaborately adorned, the left-hand side of the seat with the arm-rest above it, the two chair legs of the left side and, perhaps, the right back leg, though this is not entirely clear. The legs are adorned with patterns and little volute decorations at the top and at the bottom. The side of the seat has lost much of its decoration, but two faint figures running in the direction of the back of the chair can be made out. The end of the arm-rest is shaped like a ram's head. Geometric patterns seem to cover the rest of the arm-rest. The back of the seat has patterns arranged in horizontal rows. At the top, the throne has a horizontal bar which extends beyond the width of the throne back. Perched on the corners of this bar are two winged females, who crouch down. They are naked. Their wings reach to the top of the head of Zeus. BIBLIOGRAPHY Shefton, B. B. (1982) 149-81, pls. 41-48. Shefton, B. B. (1992) 241-51. 33. ELEUSIS WALL PAINTING OF ENTHRONED ZEUS Location unknown, Athens? Wall painting. Stucco. From Eleusis. AD 161-180. The painting seems to be in good condition, although the upper part is completely missing. There is a scratch across the right upper arm of the figure of Zeus and the adjoining part of the throne. The painting comes from a house next to the large Propylaia, which dates to the time of Marcus Aurelius, AD 161-180. Two other paintings, showing cattle and other animals with leaves on their heads, were found in the same house. They were set in frames of different colours with a border below indicating masonry, the Zeus in the middle and the animal paintings on either side. The size of the painting of Zeus is not recorded. Philios noted that in some places the walls were preserved up to almost 2m in height and the length of the wall on which this fresco was painted measured 6.5m in total. Yet another painted fragment from the same house has been found, but of this very little remains apart from some of the frame and the painted masonry below. Zeus is shown in three-quarter view, seated on his throne. He holds a sceptre in his left hand and a small, gold-coloured Nike in his right. He has a grey cloak with a green border draped around his legs and carried behind his back over his left shoulder. He wears sandals on his feet, which rest on a small footstool. The throne is decorated with non-figurative squares and lines in red paint. BIBLIOGRAPHY Borda, M. (1958) 113. Karanastassis, P. (1997) LIMC VIII, 353, no. 314. Krause, B.

The head, restored from seven fragments, has lost most of its back and crown. The nose is mostly broken away. Much of the forehead and part of the left cheek are missing too. There is some damage to the locks on the remaining right side of the head. Some of the original paintwork remains. The head comes from a temple which stood on the so-called Lo Scosato Hill near Falerii. It is not certain whether the head came from the architectural decoration of the temple or from the temple statue. The head portrays a bearded male. His face is dominated by large, round eyes with large eyelids, the upper overlapping the lower at the outer corners. The iris is painted, the pupil incised. The eyebrows are strongly marked and rounded in shape. The wide face has slightly sagging cheeks, a large mouth with a full lower lip and a full beard and moustache. The moustache hides much of the upper lip. The beard is depicted as wavy hair, becoming curly at the bottom and on the sides. Thick, wavy locks originally adorned the temples.

ZEUS FROM LABRAUNDA Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, 04.12. Head. H. 0.48m. Marble. From Caria, Mylasa. 350-340 BC. The base of the neck was worked for insertion into a draped statue. A small fragment of the himation, once draped over the left shoulder, is preserved on the left side of the neck. There are some chips missing from the base of the neck and from the locks of hair falling behind the ears. Much of the nose is broken away. The rim of the left ear is chipped. Incrustation has been removed from the right side of the face. There are two dowel holes in the crown of the head. The top and the back of the head are only roughly worked. The head comes from the E. P. Warren Collection. It was donated by the Henry L. Pierce Fund, 1904. The bearded male head comes from an over life-size statue. The hair is parted in the middle and thick, wavy locks are brought to the sides of the head, leaving the small ears exposed. The locks fall behind the ears to the neck. A slight depression around the head suggests that the hair was originally bound in a wreath, perhaps made of bronze. The beard consists of small locks lightly modelled, with longer locks at the bottom worked with the drill. The forehead is low and broad and it swells slightly in the lower part at the centre. The eyes are not deeply set, the lids are small and the openings narrow. The lips are slightly parted. BIBLIOGRAPHY Caskey, L. D. (1925) 59-61, no. 25. Comstock, M. B. &amp; Vermeule, C. C.

H. 1.78 (1.686m without head). Marble. Provenance unknown. Around AD 50. Restorations in marble include the following: the head, neck, right shoulder and arm, the right hand with the wreath, the left hand with a part of the forearm and drapery, both feet with the hem and the base. Small parts of the drapery have also been restored in marble. Part of the left shoulder, which broke off, has been repaired. The upper part of the back has been heavily worked over. There are no holes for the attachment of wings. Three round drill holes on the left shoulder were probably made by Rauch in the early 19th century. The statue is highly polished, and on the right side there are signs of disintegration, perhaps from standing outside the palace of Potsdam at one time. The statue, which may originate from Rome, was acquired in Rome for Frederick the Great in 1770. It stood at first outside the palace of Potsdam and was later transferred to</page><page sequence="394">376 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the sculpture collection of the museum. Early restorations by Cavaceppi were largely replaced in 1824/1825 by newer ones made in the workshop of Rauch. The life-size statue of Nike is known in at least eleven replicas, of which six are about the same size as this example and five are under life-size. Nike appears to be floating in the air. Her feet point downwards and her long chiton is swept back against her legs, as if by the wind, so that her knees and lower legs are fully modelled through the drapery, which then billows out on either side of the ankles. The legs are held together. The upper arms are held down but the forearms are brought forwards, the right much lower than the left. In her right hand she carries a wreath. Her left hand is clenched. She wears an ankle-length chiton fastened on the torso with crossing bands adorned with a gorgoneion where the bands cross between the breasts. The chiton is fastened on the shoulders by two large buttons. She has a mantle rolled up at the waist. It covers her lower body as far as the knees. One end falls over the extended left forearm and goes round the back of the body before being pulled round the right hip and then falling over the left forearm. The breasts and hips are well modelled through the drapery. At the back of the figure, the drapery merges with the base, while at the front the base slopes down and the feet and drapery are deeply cut, to give the impression that the figure is floating in the air. The left knee is set slightly higher than the right and the lower left leg is set a little obliquely, a peculiarity which is found repeated in several other examples of the type, for example Berlin K182, and the Jacquemart- André and Riccardi statues. The contrast between the revealing chiton and the more bulky mantle, coupled with the subject, led to the belief that this was a copy of the Nike of the Zeus of Olympia of Pheidias. The elongated proportions, however, and the mannered posture make it more probable that this is in fact a Roman creation based on a 4th century prototype. BIBLIOGRAPHY Blümel, C. (1931) 42-43, no.

Provenance unknown. AD 96-192. Four modern holes in the back indicate where bronze wings were once added by Rauch; they were set slightly higher than the antique wings, as can be seen from the attachment holes. The head is antique and seems to be made from the same, coarse-grained marble as the torso. Restorations in marble include a part of the diadem, a part of the upper lip on the left side, the tip of the nose, the neck with the curls at the sides and the hair hanging down at the back, the whole of the right arm, the left hand with the wreath and the lower arm with a bit of the drapery, the feet, the base and some small chips of the drapery. There is an inscription on the left cross band at the back: H. SALL. KM. For the history of the piece, see K181, above. The life-size statue of a floating Nike conforms closely in size, pose and attire with K181. The lower folds at the back of the chiton are much more defined in this case. The statue retains its head, unlike most of the statues of this type, but it is not certain that the head belongs to the type. It is a classicizing head, known in several copies, which, according to Gulaki, is based on a classical prototype of the late 5th century BC such as the Nemesis at Rhamnous. The hair is parted in the middle and brought to the sides in</page><page sequence="395">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 377 waves.

Both feet with the adjoining hemline have been restored, as have the neck and a part of the right shoulder and torso down to the waist, though Schräder thought this part was ancient. There are three breaks on the front, over the right hip, on the folds of the cloak and below the right thigh. The statue stands on a tall cylindrical stem, made from the same block of marble. The statue was bought from the art dealer Bardini in Florence. The life-size statue of a floating Nike conforms in size, pose and attire with K181 and K182. It is a well made copy of the type.

Previously in the Uffizi inventory, the statue was placed in the Florence Prefettura in March 1916. The statue of a floating Nike agrees in size, pose and dress with the type best seen in the Berlin Nikai, K181 and 182, and the Jacquemart- André statue. This work is coarser and more summarily executed than the first three. The hands are restored holding a wreath in the right and a long stick, across the body, in the left. The head is turned very slightly to its right. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dütschke, H. (1875) 98, no. 226. Gulaki, A. (1981) 221, no. 4, fig. 199. Mansuelli, G. A.

There is some damage to the drapery. The statue comes from Cyrene, Mission Vattier de Bourville. The fragmentary statue of a floating Nike preserves the folds of the chiton, the legs, held parallel, and the pointed feet.

The sculpture was found in 1890 in the vicinity of the railway station, Ramleh. The fragment is of a statue recognizably of the type of the floating Nike because of the pose of the legs, which are held together vertically, as is proved by the remains of the base, and the windswept drapery which covers them and at the same time models their form.

WELLCOME STATUETTE OF NIKE (Fig. 1 1.6) Newcastle upon Tyne, Greek Museum, R45 17/1936. Wellcome statuette. H. 0.77m; H. of Nike alone, 0.54m. Marble. Provenance unknown. 1st century BC. Both the forearms and the hands, which were originally inserted with iron dowels, are missing. Part of the chiton folds are also missing, from the shins to the bottom at the back. The surface is very well preserved. The head is unbroken. The back of the base has been carved out. Two holes in the back, at the level of the shoulder blades, indicate where the wings were attached. A long, narrowing groove runs from the base to where the himation goes across the back of the statuette. The sculpture comes from the collection of John Ruskin, Brantwood, Coniston. It was purchased at Sotheby's in June, 1931, by Sir Henry Wellcome, who died in 1936. In 1977, the collection was broken up and this piece, along with most of the sculpture, went to the Greek Museum in Newcastle. The under life-size statuette of Nike stands on the tips of her toes on a globe. The globe is decorated with a hexagonal pattern. Her pose and attire are characteristic of the type of the floating Nike, though here the bundle of mantle folds at the waist is wider than in most examples. This sculpture preserves its head. The hair is parted in the middle, carried in a heavy mass along the face to the back of the head, where it is gathered in a bun. Some strands fall down the neck and back. The head type differs from that of K182. Gulaki identifies it as a head of Hygieia, dating from the later 4th century BC. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gulaki, A. (1981) 224, 229-30, no. 10, fig. 208. Peyer, R.

They are supposed to have been found in the ruins of the ancient baths at Castell'Arcione, near Tivoli. They were probably restored and heavily reworked in the workshop of Piranesi before they were sold. The statuette represents a kneeling girl holding a bowl. The type is known in a number of copies. The girl wears a peplos, with apoptygma, fastened on the shoulders, and wide openings at the back exposing her shoulders. The forearms are held down. She sits back on her lower legs, her thighs held tightly together and the peplos caught between the legs. Strong ridges, set more or less parallel to each other on each leg, mark the drapery folds, and together they form a repeated V-shaped pattern from the front. Catenary folds fall between the breasts. She has no wings on her back. The feet are held parallel. They are quite large. Her hips are broad, her thighs are shortened. A broad hair-tress falls down her upper back.

End of 1st century or early 2nd century AD. Fragments from two separate sphinx groups were found. Twenty-six of these come from sphinxes, fourteen from victims, and ten from the rocky ground. Seven more fragments belonging to the groups cannot be identified with certainty. Traces of fire damage can be seen even in the fractures of the stone, indicating that the fragments suffered further damage after the initial destruction. The main fragments are the following: 1 . Fragment from the flank of a sphinx. 2. Fragment of rocky ground. 3. Right front leg of a sphinx. 4. Hind leg of sphinx and part of victim's foot. 5. Part of victim's right arm, bent at the elbow, and part of sphinx's left front leg. 6. Fragment of victim's right leg. 7. Victim's left leg. 8. Victim's right leg. 9. Victim's right leg. 10. Fragment of the heel of sphinx's right hind leg.</page><page sequence="401">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 383 11. Victim's left hand. 12. Wing fragments. 13. Fragments from victim's back. 14. Lower half of victim's face and part of thorax. 15. Breast and left arm of sphinx, plus wing attachment. 16. Fragment of victim's hair. The fragments were found in 1896 at the Harbour Baths at Ephesos. Some were found at the east end of the north front of the 'Large Hall' of the Harbour Baths, the southern exedra of the peristyle yard. Others were found north-east of the hall. All the fragments are thought to have come from the decoration of the hall. The dispersal of the fragments suggests violent destruction of the sculptures rather than just the collapse of the building. The large number of missing pieces suggests later reuse. A further fourteen pieces, listed below in catalogue no. 56, were discovered slightly earlier, and they are in London. Because some of the fragments duplicate each other, Eichler deduced that there must have been two sphinx groups. According to the reconstruction, the youth is seated on rocky ground in a contorted position, while being pinned down by the claws of the sphinx. The sphinx has leonine lower and female upper body, large wings stretching out behind her and a long, thin tail curling around the hind legs. She crouches down on her haunches, but her chest is raised. Her position is almost frontal, though the head is turned slightly to its left. The sphinx has long wavy hair. The youth is placed partly below and partly in front of the sphinx. The claws of the hind legs of the sphinx pin down the feet of the youth. The youth sits with his legs pulled up and his head falling backwards to his right. He raises his right arm and bends it forward to shield himself, while he supports himself on his left hand. His mouth is open. His hair is short and curly. The sphinx holds the youth down with her front left paw embedded in his right shoulder, while she claws at his torso with her right paw.

BOLOGNA NIOBID RELIEF Bologna, Palazzo Bevilacqua, B 237. Relief. Marble. Provenance unknown. Around AD 150. The figure on the left of the relief is damaged on the lower legs. His nose is mostly missing. There is some damage to the background surface too. The marble relief preserves two male Niobids. The kneeling Niobid, on the left, has been hit in the back of the neck and his hands are raised to this wound. His torso is arched in pain. He has fallen on to his knees and his himation is slipping down around his legs, leaving the torso and the upper thighs uncovered. His face is fully frontal and expressionless. This figure is found again on the marble disc in the British Museum, and the reliefs in Catania and in the Milani Collection in Florence. The back-view Niobid, who is found again on the Modena relief, is here depicted on the right of the relief. He is wounded in the top of his back and his right arm is bent double as his hand tries to clutch at the wound. His head is turned to the right, but much of the face is hidden behind the raised right arm. His lower body leans towards the right, with his right leg bent at the knee and the foot steadied on uneven, rocky ground which rises beneath the foot. His left leg, which is set lower down, is stretched out obliquely. His left shoulder and arm are hidden by the folds of his cloak which billow out to the figure's left side in dramatic lines. The cloak appears to be draped round the arm so that the two ends fly out one above the other. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) pl. 74, fig. 230. Cook, R. M. (1964) 44, no. 10.6. Gentili, G. V.

Her left arm is folded and brought across her front. The right shoulder appears slightly raised, as if the arm was raised too. The girl's knees have given way and she is about to collapse.

The shoulders and head of the figure on the left are missing, as well as her right forearm. Both hands are very worn. The figure on the right has lost most of the right arm and much of the left. His head and torso are very worn. The piece comes from the Milani Collection. The relief shows two Niobids. The 'kneeling' youth, on the right, is seen again in reliefs in Bologna, Catania and the British Museum. To the left of this figure is a girl, shown frontally, striding to the right. She is wearing a long garment, with a knee-length garment over it, belted at the waist, as well as a mantle. Her leading, left leg is bent and the foot rests on slightly higher ground than her right foot. Her right leg stretches out behind her, forming a strong diagonal. Her skirt appears to cling to her legs because of the speed with which she is advancing. This figure is seen again on the Modena relief and the fragment no. 20H from Isthmia. She was looking backwards. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) fig. 229. Cook, R. M. (1964) 44, no. 10.7.</page><page sequence="404">386 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEEDIAS Geominy, W.

The pose of the figure, bending forward in profile to the left with both arms stretched forwards, coupled with the drapery, a sleeveless chiton with a bunched himation falling diagonally down the back from the right shoulder, confirms that this is a depiction of Artemis in the same type as that seen on the Villa Albani Niobid relief as well as on the British Museum disc. The presence of this figure establishes that the relief to which it belongs did indeed represent the killing of the Niobids. Unlike other depictions of this type, however, a hand is placed on the back of Artemis. This may represent Leto, lending support to her daughter, and it is probably a variation by the copyist. 6 ID.

Provenance unknown. 1st century AD. The relief is made in transversely striped marble with a yellowish green patina, probably from Asia Minor. The thickness of the block is 0.094m. The relief was earlier in the Klügmann Collection. The relief represents Apollo shooting. He is shown in profile to the right on rocky ground. He crouches down on his right leg, with the right knee touching the ground, and steadies himself with the left leg which is bent in front of him, with the foot resting flat on the ground. He holds his arms stretched out before him, originally in the action of letting fly an arrow. A himation is draped round his body from the left arm, behind the back and over his right leg. One end rests on the ground in front of his right knee. This Apollo type is seen again on the British Museum disc as well as on the Baksy krater in St. Petersburg.

The edges of the relief, along the outline of the girl, and the back surface may be modern, according to Cook. The right arm with the raised part of the drapery, the left elbow, the right foot and the lower part of the face are all missing. Indications of an earlier repair include a blocked dowel hole and a smoothened fracture. The drill has been used to indicate the pupil of the right eye and some of the more deeply cut folds of drapery. The surface is very smooth, almost polished. The relief comes from Holland House. The relief depicts the collapsing girl with lifted face, as seen on the Bonn relief, as well as on the Hermitage relief and, perhaps, on the British Museum disc, though this last figure is almost completely lost apart from the lower part of the legs. Here one sees the half-closed right eye, and the hair, which is not very long, and which hangs down in a mass of locks. The head is shown in profile. BIBLIOGRAPHY Cook, R. M. (1964) 45, 10 no. 12.

Marble. Provenance unknown. 1st or 2nd century AD. The disc has been put together from three large pieces. There is a substantial amount missing from the right side and the central section. Many of the figures have lost head or limbs, and some of the figures are very fragmentary. The sculpture was bought from the Castellani Collection in 1877. The circular relief has an uneven, rocky background on which relief figures are irregularly disposed in four tiers. In the top tier are Artemis and Apollo, set back to back. The Apollo figure is seen again on the Kassel relief and the Baksy krater. See the Kassel relief for a description of the type. Artemis is shown in profile to the left. Her legs are slightly bent, the left set in front of the right. Her arms are stretched out before her as she prepares to shoot an arrow. Her back is a little hunched. She wears a short, belted peplos and a folded cloak, a broad swathe of which can be seen falling diagonally across her back from the right shoulder and over the left hip. It is then brought forward in front of her left thigh and reappears falling to the ground between her legs. This type is seen again on the Villa Albani relief and on one of the Isthmia fragments, no. 20C. In the next tier there are four figures. The first two are set in a group: a youth, standing to the left and holding his cloak up in the air with his left arm, tries to protect with his right arm a girl who kneels before him. The cloak billows out around the youth almost forming a circle. This group is not seen on any of the other reliefs preserving Niobids. Next to these two figures is a youth sitting on a rock. His right leg is completely folded beneath him while his left leg is set down in front of him. He sits on a cloak which covers his right thigh. He has lost his head and lower arms, but from the hand on the chest one can deduce that his left arm was in front of his chest. This type is not known from any other relief either, though there may be some resemblance to Isthmia fragment no. 20A. To the right of the seated youth is a</page><page sequence="407">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 389 dead youth, lying on his back with his head down to the right and his knees brought up on the left side. He is headless and armless, but from the remains of the shoulders it seems that the arms were brought over his head. A cloak covers his legs. This figure is seen again on the Villa Albani, Hermitage, and Pozzuoli reliefs. The last figure of the second tier is the kneeling youth, described with the Bologna relief. As well as on the Bologna relief, this type is found again on the Modena, Catania and Florence reliefs. The third tier consists of three well preserved figures and fragments of four more. The first figure on the left is a youth on one knee, a well known type also found on the Colonna, Villa Albani and Hermitage reliefs. He is shown in three-quarter view to the left. His right knee rests on a rock, his left leg is stretched out behind him. Both his arms reach for the wound in the middle of his arched back, the right forearm raised, the left forearm lowered. His head is shown in profile, the face brought right up. His left limbs are swathed in a mantle which flies out behind him in violent lines. One end flies out near his left foot, the fabric partly hiding his lower leg. The other end flies out beyond his left forearm, with more folds swathed around the arm. To this figure's right are two female figures set horizontally, one above the other. The upper figure is a collapsing girl with her head down, a type seen again, in a more natural, upright position, on the Hermitage relief. The type is described with that work. Below the collapsing girl with lowered head is another girl, stretched out on the ground, with her head towards the right of the composition. Remains of the left shoulder indicate that the arm was raised above the head. Her left breast is uncovered, but otherwise she is draped. This figure type is not known from other reliefs. The next four figures in the tier are very fragmentary. Of the first, only the right foot remains along with some ankle-length drapery. The drapery and pose suggest that this represents a girl moving to the right. Next comes another female figure moving to the right, but of her all that remains is again some of the drapery close to the ground and the lower part of the right leg which is partially uncovered. This may have been a figure of the type of the collapsing girl with face lifted, known from the Hermitage, Bonn and British Museum reliefs. The type is described in connection with the Bonn relief. The next figure is preserved up to the top of the legs. It is a female draped figure stepping to the right. The left leg is shown in profile, the trailing right leg is frontal. This type is not known from other reliefs of Niobids. The last relief fragment on the right shows a cloak hanging down next to the woman. It stretches from the level of her knees to below her feet. In the lowest tier are three figures. On the right is the body of a dead youth slumped over a rock, known from the Hermitage and Casino dell'Aurora reliefs. His arms hang down on the right, while his legs hang down on the left. Much of the left arm and the head are missing. The left leg is bent at the knee and the lower leg is brought up somewhat higher than the right, while the knee is brought forward. His torso is turned towards the viewer, as was his head originally. Beneath him lies a mantle which hangs down next to the left leg. One end is brought over the left foot and hangs between the legs. To the left of this figure is a group of two, not seen on other reliefs. A bearded man in a short, belted chiton and mantle stands frontally with his left arm around a small girl in a long robe. The man looks up and to his left. The girl has no head. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1951) pl. 75, fig. 231. Gentili, G. V. (1974) 101-05. Geominy, W. (1992) 921, no. 33. Hafner, G.

Lap., 8501. Relief. H. 0.56m; L. 1.31m. Marble. From Modena, Via Aemilia, sepulchral area. AD 150-200. The relief has been mended from two pieces. The relief has a border to the right, at the top and at the bottom, but it is broken off on the left side and may have some figures missing. There is some damage to the frame. The surviving figures all have some damage to head or limbs, as described below. The relief was found in a sepulchral area of the city of Modena in the San Lazzaro sector, north of the Via Aemilia. The relief slab was apparently reused to close a tomb and had an inscription carved upon it, for which see Gentili. The relief preserves five figures set on a rocky and uneven groundline. The first on the left is the fleeing girl, a type known also from the Florence relief and one of the fragments from Isthmia. The top front part of her head is missing, where the relief is broken away. The next figure is a kneeling youth type, also seen on the Bologna, Catania, and Florence reliefs as well as the British Museum disc. His right arm is damaged and partly broken away. Then comes a youth seen from back view, a type repeated on the Bologna relief. His left foot is damaged, but otherwise the figure is well preserved. The last two figures on the right form a group. A young child is seeking help from a bearded man who sits on a large and high outcrop of rock. The child wears a long cloak hanging from the right shoulder. The right arm is held out towards the man, seated on the right, while the right leg is stretched out behind the figure. The man wears a himation draped around his lower body and thighs. It is brought up behind his back and held in the raised hand, now missing. His other arm is stretched out towards the child. His head is bent down a little in the direction of the child. This group is not repeated on other known Niobid reliefs. It is included in the reconstruction of the Niobid frieze from the throne of the Zeus at Olympia by Geominy, but Vogelpohl omits it, considering it to be a copyist's addition.

The lower part of the relief has been restored with seaweed and starfish in relief. This is perhaps due to the 17th century interpretation of the depiction as Icarus falling into the sea.1103 Restored in this manner the relief was inserted in a stucco oval and placed above oné of the doors in the Sala dell'Aurora. Casino dell'Aurora is the only building once belonging to the Villa Ludovisi to escape demolition after the sale of the estate in 1885. The relief, already in the stucco oval, was in the Sala dell'Aurora in the Casino of the same name in 1623, and has remained there. The relief bears a depiction of a youth lying slumped over a rock, his arms and head stretching down on the right side. This figure type is known from the British Museum disc, with which piece it is more fully described, and from the relief in St. Petersburg. BIBLIOGRAPHY Geominy, W. (1992) 918, no. 151, type 1.

The restored left part of the relief is made of Carrara marble. On the right side, restorations include the lower right edge of the relief, with the lower right leg and foot of Artemis, as well as her left arm, the right arm of the youth next to Artemis as far as the wrist, the front of his left foot and the rock on which it stood, and the lower left leg with the drapery. Of the next figure all that survives is the lower left arm as well as part of the right arm. All the rest is restored. The relief bears the remains of three ancient figures. On the right is Artemis getting ready to shoot an arrow. This figure is familiar from the British Museum disc, with which piece the type is fully described, and from one of the relief fragments from Isthmia.

The left arm is here held down, out and away from the body. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. &amp; Amelung, W. (1893-1947) no. 1161. Cook, R. M. (1964) 44, no. 10.3. Geominy, W. (1992) 918, no. 15j, type 7.

The relief has been recomposed from a number of fragments and placed in a metal frame. It is not certain that the order in which they have been set is correct. The figures are somewhat damaged, as described below. The relief comes from the Campana Collection.</page><page sequence="411">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 393 Nine Niobids, most of which are types known from other Niobid reliefs, are depicted on this relief. On the far left is a group depicting a girl supporting her younger brother. The figures are Geominy's types 4 and 5. This group is included in Vogelpohl's reconstruction. It is perhaps depicted on the Pozzuoli relief. It is also seen on the Munich ringstones. The next figure is a dead youth with his knees raised. His head, right arm, and lower left arm are missing. He is seen again on the British Museum disc, under which piece the type is described, the Pozzuoli fragment, and the Villa Albani relief, though here the figure is mostly restored. Next comes a youth on one knee, a type familiar from the British Museum disc, the Colonna and Villa Albani reliefs. The type is described with the British Museum disc. The next two figures form a group. On the left is a standing girl, shown almost frontally. Her right leg is relaxed. She wears a long, belted peplos, which is broken diagonally across the middle. She raises her right hand in the air, while putting her left arm around the shoulders of a girl kneeling before her in a lifeless attitude. Her head, which is damaged on the crown, is bent down towards the kneeling girl. This figure, who is shown almost in three-quarter view to the left, wears a chiton which has slipped off her right shoulder so that her right breast is uncovered. Her arms hang limply down before her and her head hangs down in such a way that it is turned almost frontally. Her lower left arm and hand are partially missing, and her lower legs and feet are lost. This group is not seen on other known Niobid reliefs, but it is included in Vogelpohl's reconstruction. The next figure is the moving figure of a girl with her head bent down, a type seen again, placed horizontally, on the British Museum disc. Her legs are shown in profile to the right, while her upper torso is in three-quarter back view. Her right arm stretches out in front of her, hiding her face. Her left arm disappears in the drapery swirling dramatically behind her. Her legs are bent at the knees, the left set forwards and set at such an angle that it appears not to be able to support her weight. She appears to be wearing an ankle-length chiton, with a shorter peplos over it as well as a cloak. In front of this figure is a dead youth slumped over a rock, a type familiar from the Casino relief and the British Museum disc. The head of this figure is preserved, and it is set frontally. The last figure, on the far right, is that of a collapsing girl with her face lifted, shown in three-quarter front view. Her lower right arm is missing and her face is damaged. This figure is known from the Bonn and British Museum reliefs. It may also have been used on the disc in the British Museum, though the figure in question, the third figure from the right in the third tier down, is too fragmentary to be sure.

Relief. H. 0.40m; L. 0.43m. Pentelic marble. From Pozzuoli. AD 125-150. The fragmentary relief preserves part of one figure. His head and arms are missing and his left knee is chipped. The back of the relief is full of indentations. The relief fragment was found by chance in 1922 in Pozzuoli, along with some other sculptures. The figure partially preserved on this fragment is that of a dead youth lying on his back with his knees raised. This type is known from the Hermitage relief and the disc in the British Museum. The type is discussed in connection with the British Museum disc. BIBLIOGRAPHY Clairmont, C. W. (1963) 23-32, pl. 8.3. Cook, R. M. (1964) 44, no. 10.10. De Franciscis, A. (1953) 24-27, fig. 13.

H. 0.42m; Diam. 1.35m. H. of relief, 0.345m. Pentelic marble. From Epirus, Nikopolis. 2nd century AD. The statue base was reused in later times as a base for a pulpit. About a third of the figured frieze was removed when the base was reused, and other figures were damaged. Parts of the relief were covered by mosaics, of which some remain. These are 'medallion portraits', dating from the 5th or 6th century AD. There are eight pairs of dowel holes along the edge of the upper surface, thought to have been used for the attachment of a parapet for the pulpit. There is also a 14cm long by 10cm deep embedding in the relief itself. Its purpose is unknown. On the upper surface one can see the footmarks from an over life-size statue, with five small holes, partly filled with lead, behind the right foot, which was the weight- bearing foot. These holes may have been used to hold an attribute. Behind the left foot is another hole, but it is not known whether this belongs to the original state of the base. The relief surface is slightly concave. This enhances the plastic form of the relief which is only 0.004m deep. It is bordered above and below by a simple, projecting profiled edge. The surface of the relief is not very good. Many of the figures are damaged. The profiled mouldings at the bottom and the top of the relief panel are also very damaged, and completely broken away in places. The relief was found in 1937 by the German Archaeological Society in the middle aisle of the five-aisled Basilica B at Nikopolis, at Preveza, Epirus, built by the bishop Alkison, who died in AD 516. The round statue base is adorned with a relief depicting an Amazonomachy. All the combatants are set on the same groundline and there are no horses. Figures are either standing or kneeling on the ground and many are arranged in dramatic duelling pairs. The figures are closely packed together and there is some overlapping of figures, making the relief appear very busy. The Amazons wear trousers, belted chitons, and Phrygian caps. They are armed with lances, axes and pelta. Some have bows and arrows. The Greeks generally have helmets, cuirasses and shields, though a couple of them are completely</page><page sequence="413">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 395 naked. They are armed with swords or rocks. Starting from the right of the part covered in mosaics, one can see a duelling pair with a figure in lower relief behind them. Both figures are draped, and the Greek is set on the left side. The Amazon is very damaged. The figures step away from each other, their inner legs crossing and their faces turned towards each other. Both of them have their arms raised ready to strike. The composition, which is found used in the sculptures of the Parthenon, is similar to that used for another pair on the same relief, this time with a naked Greek about to hurl a stone and his opponent, described below. The next figures that can be made out form another pair. This time, the Amazon is on the left side. She is shown frontally. She is stepping to the left, but with her spear raised in the right hand and ready to strike the naked Greek at her side. He is in Aristogeiton pose, his right arm raised and bent back, also ready to strike. A number of other figures can be seen before the rectangular embedding made in the middle of the relief panel, but the composition is not very easy to follow here. An Amazon archer stands behind an Amazon down on her knees, both figures looking towards the right. Then follow several standing figures, one of them carrying a very big shield which hides much of a Greek soldier standing behind. Just in front of the embedding is a collapsing figure of an Amazon, in profile to the left, who is being stabbed in the back by a Greek, of whom only the lower right arm survives. The Amazon arches her back and in vain raises her right arm to get to the weapon. Her legs are already folding beneath her and her head is falling backwards. Behind these two figures is the shadowy form of a third. The collapsing Amazon echoes the Amazon of the so-called Munich Greek pair from the Athena Parthenos composition. To the right of the rectangular embedding is a low relief Greek in the background, behind another Greek. He is standing frontally, with his head in profile to the right. He wears a tunic, cuirass and a tall helmet. In front of and next to this figure, on the right, is a duelling pair consisting of a Greek pulling by the head a kneeling Amazon. The Greek is standing frontally, with his head in profile to the right. He wears a cuirass, tunic and helmet. His left hand pulls at the Amazon's head. She is wearing a chiton, trousers and Phrygian cap. Her left arm stretches over her head and grasps the arm of her aggressor, while her right arm is extended back towards his left hip. Next comes another fighting pair, with a Greek in low relief behind the man on the left. This is a very dramatic group with the figures standing in opposing diagonal lines, their legs crossing. The Greek is completely naked, apart from the helmet on his head. He carries a large shield on his left arm, while his right arm is raised and clutches a rock. His right leg is bent at the knee, the trailing left leg is held extended on the diagonal. His opponent stands in a mirror-image pose, but she turns her head back towards the Greek and her right arm is brought across her torso ready to strike the Greek with her weapon. The pose is reminiscent of that of the opponent of the 'pilos-wearer' at the bottom of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. The arrangement of the crossing legs echoes the pose of Athena and Poseidon on the west pediment of the Parthenon. The next pair consists of two draped figures, with the Amazon on the left side this time. She is shown frontally, stepping to the left while looking at the figure on the right. Both her arms are raised. She has a shield on the left arm and she is preparing to attack her opponent with a spear raised in her right hand. Her opponent is also stepping to the left, towards her, standing in the pose of Aristogeiton, his raised right arm ready to strike. This figure wears tunic and cuirass and is carrying a large shield. To the right of this pair are two Amazons, one kneeling on the ground, the other standing behind her, ready to shoot an arrow. They are both shown frontally, but with their heads in profile</page><page sequence="414">396 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS to the right, looking at a Greek warrior who stands before them. The kneeling figure raises her shield with her left arm. Most of the Greek opponent is too damaged to make out. Beyond him, a long stretch of the relief has been flattened out and some of it is covered by mosaics. Several pairs of legs can dimly be seen, and there is room for about ten to twelve more figures.

From Galaxidi, on the Corinthian Gulf. 1st or 2nd century AD. Much of the rim of the medallion is broken away, and there is some damage to the surface. The silver medallion shows Aphrodite emerging from the sea with Eros helping her up. She is naked and she holds a piece of diaphanous cloth in her raised left hand. It falls in delicate lines at her side and over her thighs. Curling waves at the bottom of the picture field reach up as far as the goddess's knees. Aphrodite is shown in three-quarter view to the right. Her right arm hangs down behind her and her head is thrown back. Eros stands a little above her, and he bends down in order to reach her, looking down as he does so. He has large wings on his back. Between his lower legs is an inscription set vertically, reading AOPOAIT. BIBLIOGRAPHY Delivorrias, A. (1984) 114-115, no. 1173. Furtwängler, A. (1895/1964) 43. Karouzou, S. (1954-1955) 67-94.

Some are very well preserved, others are very fragmentary or they have been restored from several fragments. Traces of green-tinted colourless glass have been found in these moulds, along with corundum in the form of a reddish-purple powder, which was used to line the moulds before they were heated. Corundum is a mineral species consisting of crystallized alumina which occurs naturally in Naxos and Smyrna, for example. It is thought to have been used to prevent molten glass from adhering to the clay of the moulds.</page><page sequence="415">ZEUS AT OLYMPIA 397 The moulds were found to the south of the workshop of Pheidias, in the excavations carried out by the German Archaeological Institute in the late 1950s. Most of the clay moulds came from beneath building C7-8. Along with the drapery moulds were found two other groups of moulds: small ornament moulds and large ornament moulds. The fine clay drapery moulds, which are very numerous, have a wide, flat rim and thin walls. The drapery folds which can be seen in the moulds correspond to a standing female statue, approximately three times life-size, wearing a chiton with buttoned sleeves. The moulds have been organized into various groups: elements from the left upper arm, for example, Gl-2; elements from the right upper arm, for example, G26; elements from the skirt of the chiton, for example, G32-103; and other moulds which also have chiton folds but which do not correspond with those already recognized, for example, Gil, 119, 122-135. The size of the moulds varies from one piece to the next, but many are between 30-40cm in length and about 20-30cm wide. Gl, which has been well pieced together from a number of fragments, shows thick chiton folds and a button from the left sleeve. Another well preserved piece is G33, which is roughly diamond-shaped and shows drapery folds from the lower part of the drapery. BIBLIOGRAPHY Mattusch, C. C. (1988) 179, fig. 7.9. Schiering, W.

From the workshop of Pheidias at Olympia, c. 430 BC. Restored from several fragments, the cup lacks its mouth and handle. It is carefully inscribed beneath with the words, Oeiôio[u] eiļii. A break line across the bottom of the mug goes diagonally between the iota and the omicron. The fragmentary ribbed drinking mug is of a light brown, reddish colour. It was found with all sorts of rubbish one would expect from the workshop where a chryselephantine statue was made: terracotta moulds, cores of ivory, sculpture tools, bits of metal and glass. It provides unexpected and amusing proof of the artist's presence in Olympia. BIBLIOGRAPHY Kunze, E. (1959) 309, fig. 44. Kunze, E. (1961) 16, figs. 8, 9. Mallwitz, A. &amp; Schiering, W.

THE COPENHAGEN ANAKREON TYPE The statue in Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, no. 491 (Fig. 12. 1), is identified with certainty as that of the poet Anakreon through a herm in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome, which has the same head type and which bears the inscription, ANAKPEQN AYPIKOC.1104 No other complete statue of the type is known, but there exist seven other replicas of the head, and two inscribed headless herms (see fig. 12.2 for the Altemps head). Anakreon is represented as a mature, bearded man with a strong physique. He stands with his weight on his left leg, while the right is relaxed and set to the side with a slight outward turn. The body leans a little to the right. He is naked, apart from a short cloak, or chlaina, which is wrapped unsymmetrically over the shoulders. Falling in front of the left shoulder, the chlaina crosses the back diagonally. It is then brought forward under the right arm, looped over the right shoulder and allowed to hang down at the back. The right shoulder is raised as the right arm is held up in front of the statue, evidently once holding an object in the hand, possibly a plectrum. The left upper arm falls to Anakreon 's side, swathed in the folds of the cloak, and the lower arm, now missing, would have been bent forward holding the lyre. The head turns up towards his right and is tilted back, as if the poet were tuning his strings or pausing in his song while gazing at the object held up in the right hand. The forehead has a furrow across it and the brows are pulled slightly together. The nose is long and straight, the mouth broad and slightly open with a full underlip. That the poet is ageing is suggested by the slightly sagging cheeks. His long hair is confined by a fillet, and there are small curls around the forehead, parted at the centre. The luxuriant beard is arranged in layers, over which long moustaches droop. The pubic hair is shown in two careful rows, and the penis is infibulated. The Copenhagen Anakreon was found, along with a number of other sculptures, in a luxurious Roman villa at Monte Calvo near Rieti. The villa, which was probably established in the mid 2nd century AD, belonged to Bruttius Praesens who was to become the father-in-law of Commodus. Some of the sculptures, portraits of Antoninus Pius, Lucius Verus, and Marcus Aurelius, were clearly added later, but several were either older or contemporary works, acquired or commissioned specifically for the villa. In her discussion of the context of the Anakreon statue, Ridgway recalls a number of other famous works found in the same place: the Hera Borghese, the Seated Poet, the so-called Asklepios, and four of a group of Muses, all now in Copenhagen, as well as the Borghese 1 104 Rome, Museo Nuovo Capitolino, inv. 838; cat. no. (12) 2. 405</page><page sequence="424">406 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Satyr.1105 Most of the villa sculptures went to the Borghese Collection in the 19th century, and it was from there that some were later acquired by other collections. Ridgway considers it likely that the sculpture collection of the villa was fairly eclectic, and she toys with the idea that the Anakreon was part of a thematic grouping, which included several statues of poets as well as an Apollo, of which only a tripod and a fragment of the hand holding the plectrum survive, the Borghese Satyr, probably to be interpreted as Marsyas playing the double pipes, and possibly the so-called Asklepios, which Ridgway prefers to interpret as Zeus, father of the Muses, as well as a group of four Muses.1 106 The date of the Copenhagen Anakreon statue is generally agreed to be late Hadrianic to mid 2nd century AD. Ridgway wonders whether the other copies of the type are dependent on the Copenhagen statue. She observes that the statue shares several technical features with the Seated Poet of the Monte Calvo villa, namely the use of the drill in the hair locks, the separately carved calotte, and the inserted eyes.1107 This suggests that the two sculptures issued from the same workshop. The next question which arises is the following: did the Roman sculptor who produced the Anakreon statue imitate an established Greek prototype or did he create a new composition from the resources available to them? The traditional view, which goes back to Furtwängler, is that the statue of Anakreon reflects a work by Pheidias, created around 440 BC.1108 This attribution was backed by Poulsen on the basis of a comparison with the 'Kapaneus' relief, which is generally agreed to be a copy of one of the figures from the Athena Parthenos shield.1109 According to Poulsen and other scholars, the Pheidian connection is strengthened by observable similarities with the Apollo Kassel which is also thought to be by Pheidias. Richter and Smith accord with this view, and see a close relationship between figures of the Parthenon frieze and the Anakreon statue. Voutiras too supports an attribution to the Pheidian circle or to the sculptor himself, and his comparison of Anakreon with the centaur of metope S2 leads him to the view that the Anakreon must date from before the creation of the Parthenon south metopes.1 1 10 Ridgway, on the other hand, is unconvinced by the supposed closeness between the Parthenon sculptures and the Copenhagen Anakreon. She challenges the traditional high Classical dating of the type on grounds of both style and iconography. Unclassical features, she says, include the stance, which she regards as "unstable", the smallness of the head in proportion to the long torso and broad shoulders, and the short hair arranged in "mannered 1105 Ridgway (1998) 726-32.

A similar arrangement of the chlaina is, however, found on an original Greek sculpture of the early Classical era, as well as on one other work of Roman Imperial date: the figure of Oinomaos from the east pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the so-called Borghese Poseidon or Warrior, of unknown provenance. Along with the features mentioned above, the arrangement of the chlaina speaks for a Severizing work, according to Ridgway. Since the Copenhagen Anakreon chlaina seems to assume detailed knowledge of the back as well as the front of the Olympian Oinomaos, Ridgway supposes that it was created at a time when access to the Olympian gables was possible, perhaps when repairs were being carried out. Likely periods for the creation of the type are, she thinks, the 4th century BC, when the poems of Anakreon were enjoying renewed popularity, or Hellenistic times, when there was a certain revival of the Severe style. But she does not rule out the possibility that the type was created as late as the 2nd century AD, specifically for the Monte Calvo villa. While allowing that a traditional portrait head of the poet may have been used for the statue, she suggests that, instead of copying an already existing body type of Anakreon, the Roman sculptor chose to combine the head with a different, early Classical body type to suit the requirements of the Roman context. The unusual, looped arrangement of the chlaina certainly provides an interesting link between the Oinomaos of Olympia, the Copenhagen Anakreon and the Borghese Poseidon. But it is surely an exaggeration to suggest that the latter works are copies or adaptations while the former is the original from which they spring.1112 In the three cases, the arm positions are quite different. The stances of the Copenhagen Anakreon and the Borghese Poseidon are close, though the positions of the left leg and foot do not correspond exactly, but the pondération is the reverse of that of the Oinomaos. The treatment of the anatomy and the pubic hair is also not very close, the Anakreon showing a more advanced treatment. While the chlaina is indeed looped over the right arm in each statue, the folds of the chlaina are quite different in each case, in their arrangement, and in the extent to which they cover the body. The relationship between the Olympia Oinomaos and the Anakreon remains far from clear. The arrangement of the chlaina may have some bearing on stylistic dating, but equally well it may have been used deliberately by the sculptor in order to evoke the period in which Anakreon lived, while avoiding the more typical, Ionian costume of long chiton and himation. According to Zanker, who adheres to the traditional view that the Copenhagen Anakreon type was created in Athens in around 440 BC, both the nudity and the infibulation of the poet are to be seen in the light of Periklean attitudes to Anakreon and his poems.1113 Avoiding the excesses of the symposia of tyrannical times, democratic Athens could still enjoy a more restrained and less decadent form of symposion. Hence the very sober image 1111 Ridgway (1998) 736. 1112 Ridgway (1998) 734. 11 13 Zanker (1995) 22-31.</page><page sequence="426">408 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS of the ageing Anakreon, who is shown naked rather than garbed in the traditional 'foreign' chiton and himation familiar on vase paintings, and with infíbulated penis as a sign of sexual restraint.1114 Himmelmann, on the other hand, following Voutiras, is of the opinion that the type expresses an antidemocratic attitude and probably copies an aristocratic dedication of the mid-fifth century BC.1115 He interprets the infibulation as a hallmark of the professional singer and thinks the figure's bearing reflects the fact that the singer is executing a dance step. Ridgway suggests that the infibulation may reflect nothing more than the requirements of the Roman patron who commissioned the work in the 2nd century AD.1116 In Roman times, infibulation was sometimes used for the sake of propriety rather than anything else, and, as Ridgway notes, another sculpture in the same collection as the Anakreon also has an infíbulated penis. This is the Borghese Satyr who, to judge from other replicas of the type, was probably shown playing the double pipes. But whether it is anything more than a coincidence to find two pieces in the same collection with infíbulated penis is difficult to judge. The fact that one of the figures is a satyr is perhaps significant, for the idea of a 'chaste' satyr would have had humorous implications. Ridgway thinks these would have been "out of place" in a statue group of poets and Muses but, as she makes clear, her hypothesis concerning such a group remains conjectural. Both the Muses and the Satyr were found within the premises of the villa, but in a different location from the Anakreon. 12.2. WRITTEN EVIDENCE FOR STATUES OF ANAKREON In the days of Pausanias there was a statue of the lyric poet, Anakreon of Teos, standing on the Akropolis of Athens. It was placed near a statue of Xanthippos, the father of Perikles. No base has been found for either of these statues. Pausanias does not describe the statue of Anakreon beyond commenting on the pose which, he says, is like that of a man who is singing after he has had a few drinks.1 1 17 In addition to Pausanias 's remarks, several other sources mention monuments in honour of Anakreon, but most of these are not described. In Anth. Gr. 9.599, written in the earlier 3rd century BC, Theokritos mentions a statue of Anakreon in Teos and comments that Anakreon was one of the finest of the old lyric poets and that he was fond of young men. In a poem possibly by Simonides, Anth. Gr. 7.25, the tomb of Anakreon in Teos is mentioned, and it is probable, though the source does not reveal so much, that this bore at least a portrait of the poet. There seems to have been a statue of Anakreon in Kyzikos too.1118 The 1114 Frei (1981) 39 refers to the ancient belief that chastity improved athletes' and singers' performances. 1115 Himmelmann (1995) 654f. 1116 Ridgway (1998) 730. 1117 Pausanias, I. 25. 1. 1118 Campbell (1988) 31, test. 10, n. 2.</page><page sequence="427">ANAKREON 409 only text other than that of Pausanias which describes a statue of Anakreon is Anth. Plan. 306 by Leonidas: the poet is said to be wearing a cloak which goes right down to his ankles and to have lost a shoe. The characterization of the face leads one to suspect with Richter that this statue was a "late product".1119 Anakreon also appears on some Roman coins from Teos. He is sometimes shown seated, sometimes standing with a lyre.1120 These images may also reflect statues of the poet. The details of Anakreon's life are not certain. He was born around 575-570 BC at Teos. He remained there until about 540 BC, when the place was attacked by the Persians led by Harpagos.1121 He then left with other Teans to found the colony of Abdera in Thrace, a period of his life which is reflected in some of his verses. From there he was summoned to the court of the tyrant Polykrates in Samos. When Polykrates died in 522 BC, he was brought to Athens by Hipparchos and he remained in Athens for many years, perhaps until the expulsion of Hippias in 510 BC. As a favourite poet of the tyrants, it seems likely that he became less popular with the rise of democracy in Athens and, after a spell in Thessaly, he probably returned to his native Teos where he eventually died, a very old man, and was buried, around 485 BC. Several sources have been interpreted to suggest that Anakreon returned to Athens after his stay in Thessaly, for they allude to a friendship between the poet and Xanthippos, the father of Perikles, admiration for the writings of Aeschylus and love for the grand- father of Kritias.1122 Concerning the last two ideas, there is reason to believe that they may well be true and yet not disturb the chronology set out above for Anakreon's life. For Anakreon could have come into contact with both the grand-father of Kritias and the plays of Aeschylus before his departure from Athens around 514-510 BC. A friendship with Xanthippos is more problematic. He was probably born some time between 535 and 520 BC. The exact date is not known, but either way he was much younger than Anakreon and probably too young to form a proper friendship with the poet, if Anakreon left Athens by 510 BC at the latest. On the other hand, the one source which alludes to such a friendship is very late and notoriously muddled, so it should not be given too much weight without further evidence. In the past it has been used to suggest that the statues of Anakreon and Xanthippos on the Athenian Akropolis, were perhaps dedications made by Perikles and intended to stand together as a group composition. It should be stressed that there is no evidence at all in the sources that this is the case and, as Ridgway says, even the proximity of the two works may not reflect more than the arrangement of the sculptures in the time of Pausanias.1123 1119 Richter (1965) 75-76. 1120 See Richter (1965) 77a-c, figs. 294-97.

Anakreon's popularity in the 4th century BC is attested to by the compilations of his works which were made in this period. And from the late 2nd and early 1 st centuries BC numerous imitations of his metres and poems were produced, an activity which continued to be enjoyed until as late as the 6th or 7th century AD. Furthermore, the surviving descriptions of statues of Anakreon mentioned earlier, which characterize the poet as inebriated, suggest that the statues may not go back further than the Hellenistic period. In the time of Aristophanes the old poets were regarded as rather elegant characters with the refined customs of late Archaic society.1124 Because of the poet's links with tyrants and aristocratic living, a date in the mid 5th century BC for the statue, when democracy held sway, is more difficult to explain. One suggestion, made by Voutiras, is that the statue on the Akropolis was set up by oligarchs opposed to Perikles.1125 Zanker, who supports the traditional idea that the statues of Xanthippos and Anakreon were both set up by Perikles, suggests that the statues were used to make a political statement about Athenian democracy.1126 Xanthippos, father of Perikles, would have been remembered chiefly as the warrior who helped to destroy the Persian fleet at Mykale in 479 BC, thus helping to win freedom for the Greeks. In contrast with this ideal of heroic bravery in warfare, Zanker proposes that a sober and serious portrait of Anakreon would have exemplified the proper enjoyment of the symposion, not as it was practised in the extravagant days of the tyrants but in the more restrained form in which it was enjoyed in democratic times. Seen in this light, the Copenhagen Anakreon, discussed, in section 1 , would be an appropriate type for the Akropolis image, according to Zanker, both because of the nudity of the figure and the infibulation which imply restraint and a certain distancing from earlier Ionian habits. There is of course no proof that the statue Pausanias saw was of the Copenhagen Anakreon type. But Pausanias 's description of the statue may be reconciled with the Copenhagen piece if the movement of the right foot, the backward lean of the pose and the tilted head are seen as erroneously attributed by Pausanias to unsteadiness due to drinking. According to another interpretation, the poet is shown marking the rhythm of his song. 12.3. CATALOGUE 1. COPENHAGEN ANAKREON (Fig. 12.1) Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek, 491. Statue. H. 1.98m.

The eyes were inlaid and are missing. This suggests that the piece copies a bronze original. Formerly in the Borghese Collection, it was acquired for the Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek in 1881. It was found in 1835 in Francesco Capranesi's excavation at Monte Calvo in the Sabine Hills, in the Villa of C. Bruttius Praesens. The owner of the villa has been identified from inscribed lead pipes and brick stamps. Identified from an inscribed herm (Rome, Museo Nuovo Capitolino, 838) showing the same head type, the subject of the statue is Anakreon. The poet is characterized as ageing and bearded. His physique is strong and muscular, and he is naked apart from a short cloak, or chlaina, which is draped over each shoulder. The looped and unsymmetrical arrangement of the chlaina is unusual. One end falls in front of the left shoulder, down to the top of the leg. From the left shoulder it passes diagonally down over the back. It is brought forward under the right arm and looped over the right shoulder, where it then hangs down vertically. The figure stands in Classical pose, resting his weight on his left leg, while the right is relaxed and set forward and to the side, with a slight outward turn of the foot. Both feet are placed flat on the ground. The body leans gently to the right. The right shoulder is raised and the right arm is bent forward and held a little way up in front of the statue, evidently once holding an object in the hand, perhaps a plectrum. The left upper arm hangs close to the torso, swathed in the folds of the chlaina. The left lower arm, which is now missing, would have been bent forward. It was separately worked and pinned by a dowel at the elbow. The left hand would have held the barbiton, presumably. The head is tilted back a little and set obliquely, turning to the figure's right. The eyes are hollow; they would have been inlaid originally. The forehead is marked by a furrow, and the brows are pulled slightly together. The nose is long and straight, the mouth broad and slightly open, with a full underlip. The face has pronounced cheek bones, and the slightly sagging cheeks hint at the age of the subject. The long hair is confined in a fillet, and small curls, parting at the centre, frame the forehead. Some of the curls go up on to the taenia. A luxuriant beard, with curls arranged in layers, covers the lower face and neck, and long moustaches droop down over it. The pubic hair is arranged in two careful layers of curls. The penis is infibulated. A tree-trunk support follows the outer contour of the left leg up to the middle of the thigh. Remains of a broken strut can be seen on both the lower legs.

THE APOLLO KASSEL TYPE The Apollo Kassel type (Figs. 13.1-2) is known in at least twenty-three marble replicas of the statue, torso or head, and two bronze figurines; it has also been identified on gems (see, for instance, Fig. 13.3) and on coins. This is likely to mean that the Greek original was well-known and of some importance. It was certainly popular in the Roman period. The statue type represents a standing, naked young man, resting his weight on his left leg, with the right leg relaxed and set forward half a step. The soles of both feet rest fully on the ground. Both upper arms are held down by the body, with the right forearm advanced a little and once holding an object in the hand, probably a laurel branch, or a locust. The left forearm is more sharply bent at the elbow and extended forward holding another object, almost certainly a bow with two arrows. The head, which is lowered and turned in the direction of the supporting leg, has strong, severe features with large eyes, a long straight nose, wide cheeks and a heavy, rounded chin. The lips are full but the mouth is quite narrow. The ears are partly obscured by the long hair which is arranged in an elaborate, distinctive style. Long wavy locks lie close to the crown of the skull, and radiate downwards to a broad, flat fillet, or ribbon, which encircles the head just above the ears and the forehead. The fillet is mostly obscured by a more volumetric, and complex, arrangement of hair that lies over it. At the back two long plaits are drawn from behind each ear in alternate directions, crossing above the nape of the neck where they are held by a clasp or ribbon. The plaits are carried forward over each ear, beyond which they merge into, or disappear under, the elaborate tress of hair over the forehead. This is parted in the middle, and extends either side in a series of long curls, arranged in five layers, which increase in width over the temples, and terminate in a severe edge in front of each ear. From behind the ears on each side of the neck two (or occasionally three) long spiralling curls hang down on to the shoulders at the front. Below the plaits at the back of the head, on some replicas, wispy strands of hair extend further down the neck. The pose combines elegant movement of the legs with a certain stiffness in the torso that betrays lingering influence from later examples of the kouros-type. In the stance, which is found in many statues of the early Classical period, the free leg (here the right) is set forwards, both feet rest flat on the ground, and the left hip is raised slightly higher above the supporting leg. This pelvic movement is mostly absorbed in the design of the torso, for the shoulders remain almost level in frontal view, as do the pectorals. There may be a very slight rise of the right shoulder compared with the left, but it is barely noticeable. The result is a squareness of composition in the upper body that counteracts the incipient open right side, and contracted left side, of the torso. By contrast the head is turned and lowered quite markedly towards the supporting leg, following usual early Classical practice. The pose 417</page><page sequence="436">4 1 8 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDI AS therefore lacks the full chiastic balance developed later by Polykleitos, and finds close parallels in the Riace bronze statues, and in the Omphalos Apollo type. The head of the Apollo Kassel is, however, relatively larger than on these statues, and this, together with the muscular treatment of the anatomy, produces a stockier appearance which is more in keeping with Polykleitan taste. The original statue is usually assigned to the early Classical period and dated around 480-460 BC, but it is sometimes lowered to around 450 BC on the basis of its style, most recently by Boardman and by Simon.1127 Other, more radical, interpretations have been made, notably by Ridgway who doubts the 5th century Greek origin of the statue.1128 The type is known from Greece in only a few replicas of Hadrianic date, a chronological concentration which was remarked on also by Schmidt. One of the features which has been considered eclectic, or classicistic, is the complicated hairstyle, with its combination of flat locks, braided plaits and elaborate frontal curls. Similar arrangements, however, with crossing braided plaits drawn forwards from the back of the head, and combined with longer locks over the forehead, are known from the bronze Zeus of Artemision and the Omphalos Apollo type, so that a creation of the kind found on the Apollo Kassel is not inconceivable from the hands of a master sculptor. Raeder shares Ridgway' s suspicions on the hairstyle, and suggests that the spiral curls in paratactic arrangement are a classicizing formula of Hadrianic/ Antonine sculptors.1129 But he still accepts the Apollo Kassel as a copy of genuine Classical original, whereas Ridgway concludes that the Apollo Kassel type might be a Roman creation or a Classical work with a Roman hairstyle. In the opinion of the present writers the Apollo Kassel is likely to reproduce a lost bronze masterpiece of around 470-460 BC, and its attribution to Pheidias seems to be a strong possibility. 13.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The Roman replicas of the Apollo Kassel type and their chronology have been thoroughly discussed by Schmidt but the attribution of the original to one Greek sculptor or another is summarily dealt with.1130 In agreement with most scholars, Schmidt settled for Pheidian authorship, but there are some who would attribute the type to other early Classical sculptors, notably Kalamis.1131 In the catalogue from the exhibition in Kassel in 1991, Gercke chose to follow recent research and identify the Apollo as the Apollo 'Parnopios', 1127 Boardman (1985a) fig. 68; Simon (1984) LIMC II, no. 41. 1128 Ridgway (1981) 184ff. 1129 Raeder (1978) 265-66. 1130 Schmidt (1966). 1131 Harrison (1996) 64-65.</page><page sequence="437">APOLLO KASSEL 419 reconstructing him with a bow and arrows in the left hand and a locust in the right.1132 The whole statue was reproduced in a cast which was painted like a new bronze work. The struts between the legs and the support by the left leg created for the marble copies were removed and the details were finished in accordance with information provided by the Riace bronzes. For instance, the lips were made in copper. The result is very successful in providing an idea of the appearance of the original statue. Langlotz made the important observation that on the coins, which probably depict the original of the Apollo Kassel type, the statue is seen in profile.1133 This might indicate that the work was a dedication ("Weihbild"), which could be seen from all sides, rather than a temple image. The large number of replicas of the type and its appearance on coins suggest that the original was an important and popular work. The Apollo 'Parnopios' on the Athenian Akropolis is mentioned in only one source, namely Pausanias, 1. 24. 8. 1134 From Pausanias's phrasing it seems that the work was unsigned. Pausanias records that the work was of bronze and that it was called 'Parnopios', the Locust god, because the god was believed to have saved the people from a plague of locusts. Thus the statue was an offering of thanks and it stood in a very important place on the Akropolis, in front of the east side of the Parthenon. There is one possible difficulty in identifying the Apollo Kassel statue type with the Apollo 'Parnopios' by Pheidias. The statue must still have been in Athens and on the Akropolis in the 2nd century AD, when Pausanias saw it there. But, as noted by Schmidt and Simon, most of the replicas were found in an Italian context and were made in the early Antonine period or under Hadrian. There was in fact much activity on the Acropolis under Hadrian, as is clear from the copies made of the Erechtheion caryatids and the Athena Parthenos. Other statues may well have been copied then or at an earlier date, and casts, once transported to Italy, could have provided sufficient impetus for copyists. 13.3. CATALOGUE 1.

The statue is well preserved, but the surface has been worked over. It was cleaned and partly restored in 1973-1974. It was probably found in 1721 in the grounds of an Imperial Roman villa on Lago di Sabaudia, between Nettuno and Terracina. According to Winckelmann, it was found in a small temple. It then became part of the Conti collection in Rome, where it was seen by Winckelmann in 1758. Purchased in 1766 or 1767 by Count 1132 Gercke (1991) 18 n. 2. Strocka (2004) 5. v. Pheidias, section on Apollo Parnopios, 217, prefers the restoration with the laurel branch in the right hand, considering that there is no evidence to support the idea that Apollo held a locust. 1133 Langlotz (1947) 77-78. 1134 Tzetzes, Chil. VIIL317, also attributes an Apollo to Pheidias, but this is the so-called Anthelios Apollo which was not by Pheidias.</page><page sequence="438">420 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Friederich II, and exhibited from 1779 in the Museum Friedericianum. In 1807-15 it was displayed in Paris (for the Musée Napoléon) in the Salle des Fleuves, together with the Louvre replica. This well preserved, over life-size statue of a standing nude male is the name-piece of the Apollo Kassel type. The figure is powerfully built, with broad shoulders, narrow waist and hips. It stands with the weight on the left leg, while the right leg is relaxed and set forward half a step. Both feet are flat on the ground. The head is lowered and turned slightly to the left, as the gaze was once directed at the bow which was held in the left hand. The left forearm is extended. The right arm is lowered, with the forearm held forwards. The lightly clenched fingers would have held some appropriate object, such as a laurel branch, crown or locust. Beside the outer left leg is a tree-trunk support added by the copyist, decorated with quiver and strap. The powerful rendering of the anatomy, which is particularly fine at the back, and the composition of the stance find close parallels in the Riace bronze statues. The head has severely beautiful features, with heavily lidded éyes, a long, straight nose, a broad, slightly open mouth, and a strong, rounded chirk- The hairstyle is very characteristic of the statue type, and of the early Classical period when the original was created. Shallow waves of hair radiate downwards from the crown of the head, lying close to the skull. These are confined by a broad, flat headband that encircles the head just above the ears. Over this two long plaits are gathered together at the back of the head. They are drawn in opposite directions from behind each ear, crossing over above the nape of the neck, where they are bound together by a ribbon or smooth clasp. As they pass forward above each ear, they merge into, or are obscured by, an elaborate tress of curling hair over the forehead. This is divided by a parting that comes just to the left of the mid-point over the nose, and is arranged either side in five layers of curls that terminate in front of each ear. From behind the ears two long, spiralling locks of hair descend to the shoulders. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bieber, M. (1915) Iff., no. 1. Gercke, P. (1991) no. 1. Neudecker, R (1988) 215-217, no. 57.1.

Earlier restorations which characterized the statue as Mercury and Bonus Eventus have been removed. The surface is weathered from external display. The statue is from the collection of Cardinal Richelieu. Until the French revolution it was displayed outside, on the façade of Richelieu's palace, and restored as Mercury, with wings in the hair. Later, it was restored as Bonus Eventus, and in 1807-1815 it was exhibited together with the Kassel replica in the Salle des Fleuves of the Musée Napoléon.</page><page sequence="439">APOLLO KASSEL 421 The statue depicts a standing, naked, male figure, in the type of the Apollo Kassel. The composition, pose, treatment of anatomy, and head type conform closely to the statue in Kassel, although the overall impression created is slenderer and more attenuated.

Missing parts include most of the nose, the upper part of the forehead and the hair above. The head seems unfinished. At the back of the neck a large marble block still remains uncut, and some details such as the interior of the mouth and the ears are not fully worked out. The head was found in 1875 at Athens, east of the Olympieion, not far from the torso of Apollo Kassel type, Athens, NM 1612. The two fragments do not, however, belong to the same statue. The head is of Apollo Kassel type, close in style to the heads of the statues in Kassel and Paris. The oval face has severe features with thick eyelids, a broad mouth and large, rounded chin. The hair lies close to the skull, falling in waves to the fuller brim of hair made up of the crossed plaits at the back and the longer curling locks over the forehead.

The facial features are severe, with heavily lidded eyes beneath strong brows, emphatic rounded jaw, and lightly opened mouth.

The hair radiates down in shallow waves from the crown of the skull, and is confined by a fillet. Below this there is a more volumetric treatment, with a mass of centrally-parted curls framing the forehead, and two plaits of hair at the back, fastened where they cross above the neck.

There is an irregular break at the mid-point of the neck. The head was acquired in the art market in 1989 by an American collector. It was resold at Christie's 8 Dec. 1993, lot 87, for £42,000 to a German private collector. This head of a young man conforms to the Apollo Kassel type. The face has severe, full features; the eyes are large, the cheeks broad, the nose straight and long, the mouth slightly open, and the chin large and rounded. The hair lies in waves that radiate from the top of the skull. They are confined by a taenia that runs around the head, below which the hair continues in two, crossed-over plaits, and at the front in a mass of curls, parted in the middle. Behind the ears two long, twisting curls hang down at each side. At the back of the neck are remains of a block of uncut marble, similar to that found on the head in Athens NM 47. Several other details on this head also find close comparison with the Athens head, notably the rendering of the hair, particularly the locks that descend below the ears. A major difference, however, is that whereas the Athens head is considered unfinished with several details not fully worked out, including the marble block at the back of the neck, this head seems fully finished in every respect, except for the block behind the neck. Given these circumstances, the origin of this head requires further consideration. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gercke, P., ed. (1991) no. 23.

The top and back of the skull, and the nose are missing. The head has been fitted on to a torso of Apollo Kassel type, which does not belong. The head was found shortly after 1930 during excavations in the vicinity of the Templům Pacis (Forum of Vespasian). The head is of Apollo Kassel type. The details of hair and facial features are represented with particular care, especially the corners of the eyes, the incised irises, and the lightly parted lips with the line of the teeth within.

The head appeared in the Vienna art market in 1879, reportedly from Athens, and it was acquired for the Vienna University Collection in 1887. The head is of Apollo Kassel type. The facial features and hairstyle conform in general to the head of the Kassel statue, but there are particularly close similarities in terms of details with the head in Florence.

According to Gercke, the inventory notes are "Gesicht überarbeitet. H. 13,5 cm. Geschenk Herr Bieber-Schönau. Erworben von griechischem Kunsthändler." The Statuette is of a young man, naked and resting on his left leg with the right set forward. His right arm is held along the body, the left is bent at the elbow and pointing forward. The head is turned to the figure's left. The hair lies close to the skull. It is parted at the front and rolled up in a thick mass, roughly depicted in wavy lines, around the head. Two long curls hang down each side on to the shoulders. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gercke, P. (1991) no. 27. Schmidt, E. M. (1966) 10, no. 23, 35-36, fig. 9. 25.

The gem is adorned with an Apollo Kassel type seen in profile from the right. He stands resting his weight on his left leg, the right relaxed and set forwards, and both feet flat on the ground. The features of the face cannot be distinguished but the hairstyle is of the characteristic arrangement, with long, waves lying close to the skull, confined by a headband, and thicker tresses that are tied together at the back. Long locks seem to be falling down on to the shoulders. There may be signs of a short cloak worn over the breast, unless this is a fault in the gem. He holds a bow and two arrows forward in the left hand, and a laurel branch and fillets in his right. Behind him is a shoulder-high column surmounted by a vase. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gercke, P. (1991) no. 31.

THE APOLLO TIBER TYPE Seven replicas, comprising three marble statues, two heads and two bronze statuettes, supply the evidence for the standing Apollo type known as the Tiber Apollo. The two principal marble replicas, from the Tiber (Fig. 14.2) and from Cherchel (Fig. 14.1), indicate an over life-size original, a little more than two metres in height, but they present very great differences in the treatment of the anatomy. Probably the powerful, muscular form of the Cherchel copy preserves a more faithful rendering of the prototype than does the slimmer, weaker treatment of the Tiber name-piece, which is sentimentalized, and even reduced by the effects of river water, according to Zanker.1135 The statues and statuettes are in reasonable agreement about the original composition. The weight was visibly disposed on the left leg, and the right leg was relaxed and set slightly forward and to the side, with both soles of the feet resting flat on the ground, in a stance similar to that of the Riace bronzes, particularly statue B. Above the angled line of the pelvis the right side of the body was expanded and open, and the left side contracted and compressed. This contrast was emphasized by the pose and treatment of the arms, the right arm hanging loosely down beside the open side of the torso, while the left arm, on the compressed side of the body, was sharply bent at the elbow, with muscles in tension. An object held up above shoulder- level in the left hand at which the god's gaze was directed, perhaps a laurel branch or a bow or both, would explain the marked leftward turn and downward inclination of the head, lending a thoughtful and contemplative aspect to the overall composition. The rendering of the hair, with a distinction between conventional wavy grooves on the crown of the head and longer locks curling over the forehead and falling on to the shoulders, again finds many parallels in the bronze sculpture of the early Classical period. In LIMC, two different interpretations are presented for the Tiber Apollo. Palagia follows Fuchs in arguing that the relationship with the Riace bronzes excludes the supposition that it is a classicizing type.1136 The type is viewed as originating around 450 BC, perhaps a bit earlier. This is the traditional view, shared also by Paribeni, who sees the long shoulder locks and the side support as indications that the original was made of bronze, and who thinks that while several features of the type - the fully frontal pose, with upright neck, the hairstyle and the Attic stance with horizontal pectorals and shoulders - are early Classical, others, such as the head position, and the movement of the right leg to 1135 Zanker (1974) 91-92. 1136 Palagia LIMC II (1984) 'Apollon' no. 600. Fuchs (1981) 25-28. 433</page><page sequence="452">434 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the side, indicate a slightly later date.1137 Zanker, however, argued that the type is classicizing, a view shared by Simon.1138 Both scholars believe the marble statues to be early Antonine copies of an Augustan type. According to them, the type is not well handed down, and the two bronze statuettes testify to eclecticism in the way that the body and head have been combined and in the emphasis on the laurel in the left hand. Simon argues for the Augustan origin of this motif, which is found in the bronze statuettes. The laurel does not appear to have been used in this way as an attribute in 5th century BC Greek sculpture. It was not until Augustus received his honours from the Senate in 27 BC that the symbol became meaningful. By the Antonine period it had lost this significance again, which would explain the change of attributes, most clearly seen on the Cherchel replica of the type. It is noteworthy that, in the late Hadrianic period, versions of the body type of the Tiber Apollo were used for portraits of Antinous, one of which was found at Delphi.1139 Contrary to the views of Simon and Zanker, this fact might imply that the original was a Classical statue and not an Augustan invention. 14.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The varied group of sculptures of the Apollo Tiber type has been supposed by many scholars to derive from a bronze original statue of the mid 5th century BC, attributed by Furtwängler, Fuchs and others to Pheidias, and by Studniczka, Dörig and others to Kalamis. Some scholars, however, consider the type to be a classicizing one of Augustan origin which was then copied later in the Roman Imperial period. One reason for associating the Tiber Apollo with Pheidias is the relationship between this type and the Dresden/Bologna Athena type, assuming one accepts the identification of that type with the Athena Lemnia. Both statues have a somewhat similar inclination of the head, giving the figures an absorbed air. The closed, inward-looking conception is reminiscent of the Hermes Ludovisi too, another work sometimes associated with Pheidias. Attempts have been made, notably by Fuchs, to associate the Tiber Apollo with the Apollo of the Marathon group of Pheidias at Delphi.1140 Kron rules it out as part of this group on the grounds that the posture and bent head cannot have been directed at another statue in the group, since the god is obviously engrossed in the object held in his left hand.1141 There is little evidence, however, for the degree of interrelationship between sculptures in a statue group dating from the second quarter of the 5th century BC. The Tiber Apollo has also been compared with the Athena/ Aphrodite head in Brescia, originally thought to be from the Marathon Monument, though here rejected as too late for 1137 Paribeni( 1979)210. 1 138 Zanker (1974) 91-92; Simon (1984), LIMC II, 'Apollon/Apollo' no. 38. 1139 Zanker (1974) 97-98, pl. 74, 3. 1140 Fuchs (1981) 25-28. 1141 Kron (1976) 220.</page><page sequence="453">APOLLO TIBER 435 that group.1142 For a more detailed discussion of the problems than that put forward in LIMC II, see Paribeni.1143 The latest attribution of the type to the Marathon Monument is probably that by Giuliano. 1 144 Kalamis is known to have made two statues of Apollo. One was an Apollo Alexikakos which stood in front of the temple of Apollo in the Athenian Agora.1145 The other was an Apollo Iatros which was colossal and was made for the city of Apollonia in Pontus.1146 This statue was brought to Rome in the 1st century BC by Lucullus, where it was probably seen by Quintilian and Cicero.1147 Cicero judged the work to be hard. A type similar to the Tiber Apollo type can be seen on certain coins of Apollonia.1 148 14.3. CATALOGUE 1. APOLLO TIBER (Fig. 14.2) Rome, Museo Nazionale, 608. 'Tiber' Apollo. Statue. H. 2.04m. Marble. Rome, from bed of Tiber, near Ponte Palatino. AD 120-150. The statue was found broken into numerous pieces. Restorations include parts of the right leg and most of the right foot, though the tips of the toes with the edge of the plinth are ancient, the right shoulder, the left side of the plinth, the left foot and the lower left leg to the middle of the shin, the lower part of the tree trunk, part of the upper left leg, and the ends of the long curls hanging down the neck. Missing: the right hand, and the left arm from just below the shoulder. There is also some damage to the chin, the lower lip and the end of the nose. A large part of the surface has been badly eroded by water, due to the statue's long immersion in the Tiber. The sculpture was discovered in the Tiber in Rome in 1891, between the Palatine bridge and the so-called Bagni di Doma Olimpia. The name-piece of the Apollo Tiber type is an over life-size statue of a naked young man with broad shoulders and slim, lithe bodily proportions. He rests his weight on his left leg, while the right leg is relaxed and set slightly forwards and to the side, with the sole of the foot placed flat on the ground. The torso is fully frontal. The left hip is raised and there is contraction of the muscles on the left side, but the pectorals and the shoulders remain completely horizontal, in the manner of early Classical sculpture. Later features include both the placing of the right foot, which is set somewhat to the side, and the head position: the neck remains upright but the head is turned to the left and gently inclined downwards. 1 142 See the Marathon Monument at Delphi for further discussion of this matter. 1143 Paribeni (1979) no. 130. 1 144 Giuliano (1984) 297-306. 1 145 Pausanias, 1.3.3.

The right arm hangs vertically beside the body, with the muscles relaxed. A small trace of the bow once held in the right hand remains visible above the right knee. This attribute helps to identify the figure as Apollo. The left arm is mostly missing but, from what survives of the shoulder, it is clear that the upper arm was held down, but also away from the body, with the muscles tensed. The figure's gaze was clearly turned towards some object once held in the left hand. The head is characterized by a high rounded crown, broad cheek bones and a small, pointed chin. The face has simple, severe features, with thickly lidded eyes, emphatic lines for the nose and the low-arching eyebrows, and a small mouth. The hair, which lies close to the skull in shallow grooves, is confined by a narrow, rounded band. Below this band, tight curls frame the forehead and temples, and long locks fall behind the ears to the shoulders. BIBLIOGRAPHY Giuliano, A. ed. (1984) 298-99, fig. 3. Helbig, W.

CHERCHEL APOLLO TIBER TYPE (Fig. 14.1) Cherchel Museum. Statue. H. 2.10m. Marble. From Cherchel. AD 130-150. Though found broken into eight pieces, the statue is very well preserved. Missing pieces include the right arm below the elbow, though the hand and the wrist are preserved, the lower left forearm and hand, and the tip of the nose. The left arm has been broken at the shoulder and reattached. Both lower legs have been fractured and repaired between the knee and the ankle. The statue was found in 1910 in the private garden of N. Louis in Cherchel, on a site where many other antiquities have also been unearthed. The statue, which had fallen from its base, was lying on its front in a chamber measuring c.20m by 8m, with a mosaic pavement and walls reveted in coloured marble. The statue is of the Apollo Tiber type, but slightly larger than the Tiber statue. It shows many similarities with the Tiber statue, but the differences are noteworthy and instructive. While the body pose and the head position are close to those of the Tiber statue, the right arm is held slightly further from the body and the head is held more erect, giving a less concentrated and absorbed air to the figure. The proportions of the body are wider and the muscles more powerfully modelled than on the Tiber Apollo. These features accord with other examples of this type, for example the ex Borghese statue and the bronze statuettes in Vienna and Paris. It therefore seems probable that the Tiber Apollo is less faithful to the prototype in this respect and that its appearance has been modified by the damage suffered from years spent lying in river water. The effect of the face is also rather different from that of the Tiber Apollo. The face is wider and flatter in shape, and the features are much more softly modelled. As a result, the features do not dominate the face as strongly as they do in the case of the Tiber Apollo.</page><page sequence="455">APOLLO TIBER 437 In addition, the copyist has clearly enjoyed contrasting the smoothness of the face and the light-dark effect produced by the hair, with its strongly carved rows of tight curls, each with a drill-hole at the centre, set around the face. The hanging locks on the neck are rendered very plastically, as on the Tiber Apollo. Another difference is the enormous and very cumbersome tree trunk to the figure's left which is home to a falcon, placed near the top, and a snake, which coils around the trunk. The trunk serves the double purpose of supporting the marble statue and at the same time maintaining the attribute of the left hand, namely the laurel branch, which is completely lost on the Tiber Apollo. The quiver at the foot of the statue reminds one of the attribute once held in the right hand, which would have been Apollo's bow. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dörig, J. (1965) 138-265, 231 n. 401, no. 2. Michon, E.

Antonine period. From photographs it appears that the statue has been put together from several fragments. The surface is quite weathered. The head is alien. This statue used to be in the collection of the Villa Borghese in Rome. It has now disappeared from there and is thought to have been on the art market. Its present whereabouts is unknown. The statue is of the Apollo Tiber type, with an alien head. The general pose conforms to type, but the arms are held somewhat differently. The left arm is straight and it is lowered and held away from the body, while the right arm, which is also lowered, has the wrist bent. The direction of the upper left arm mirrors that of the Cherchel statue. It seems probable that the forearm has been incorrectly restored, and that it should have been shown bent sharply upwards at the elbow. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dörig, J. (1965) 231 n. 401, no. 3, fig. 77.

The head was formerly in the Albani Collection. The head is of the Apollo Tiber type, fitted to a body of the Apollo Kassel type. The face and the arrangement of the hair recall those of other examples of the type, but there are some interesting differences to be observed here. The waves of hair on the skull above the</page><page sequence="456">438 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS fillet are very flat, more so than on the Tiber Apollo name-piece and the Cherchel examples. The long locks which fall from behind the ears do not hang free of the neck at all, as in the Tiber and Cherchel statues; they resemble the locks of the Terme statuette head. The snail-shell curls about the face are small and they have drilled centres, like the Cherchel statue. The most distinctive feature is the face. It is much more elegant and feminine than on other examples of the type, with pronounced cheek-bones, a small chin, almond-shaped eyes with delicate lids and a small mouth, with a thin upper lip and a slightly fuller lower lip.

PARIS STATUETTE OF APOLLO TIBER TYPE Paris, Musée du Louvre. Statuette. H. 0.328m. Bronze. From Italy. Julio-Claudian. There is a modern hole on the lower part of the back, and a nail at the left heel. The right foot has been broken and remounted. The back of the right shin has been repaired. The colour of the bronze is olive green and black. The statuette came from the Este and Pourtalès Collection in 1865. The statuette is of the Apollo Tiber type. Characteristic of the type are the leg and arm positions and the slight turn of the head to the figure's left. But the hair and the face are treated in an archaizing fashion, making the piece an eclectic combination of severe body and archaizing head. Zanker dates the piece to the Hadrianic era, while Simon dates it to the Early Imperial period. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dörig, J. (1965) 231 n. 401, no. 6. Furtwängler, A. (1897) 57, pl. 11.

The piece was acquired from the Villa Patrizi in Rome. This small head from a statuette is of the Apollo Tiber type. The face and hairstyle resemble the Tiber Apollo type, but there are noticeable differences. The features are soft with wide, rounded eyes, a delicate nose, and a small mouth with thin lips. The effect of the face is much more boyish than that of the Tiber Apollo name-piece. The hair is rendered in less detail than on some other examples of the type. The waves of hair on the crown and</page><page sequence="457">APOLLO TIBER 439 the rows of curls framing the face are schematically rendered, while the longer locks cling to the neck instead of hanging fairly freely, as they do on the Tiber and the Cherchel statues.

This well preserved statuette is of the Apollo Tiber type. Following the scheme of the type, this figure is shown standing with his weight on the left leg, with the right more relaxed and set to the side. The right arm is held down, while the left is bent at the elbow and raised, and the head turns in this direction, to the left and slightly down. The hair is arranged in wavy strands close to the skull, bound by a fillet, and there are curls above the forehead and in front of the ears, and longer corkscrew ringlets falling over the breast. The length and the archaic arrangement into corkscrew locks of the hair on the shoulder are very untypical features. There is a wedge under the right heel and the left foot is set on a low rectangular block. Both hands look as if they once held objects, but these are now completely lost. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dörig, J.

THE ATHENA HOPE/FARNESE TYPE The Athena Hope takes its name from Thomas Hope, the former owner of the most distinguished of the copies of the type, once in the Hope collection at Deepdene, now in Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Fig. 15.1). 1149 The Hope Athena is very closely associated with the Athena Farnese in Naples (Fig. 15.2), earlier in the Albani collection, and more distantly with an Athena still in the Albani collection (Fig. 15. 3). 1150 These statues have been discussed thoroughly by Preyss and Mathiopoulos, but there still exists controversy in the field.1151 In the following discussion, the Hope and Farnese Athenas are treated as belonging to the same type, while the Albani Athena is shown to be different enough to be regarded as a separate type. In addition to the Hope Athena, there are ten well known replicas of this statue version: four statues or fragments of statues and six heads. These are the statues in Copenhagen and the Hermitage, the torso in the Vatican, the Akropolis fragments, and the heads in University College London, Ostia, Palermo, Antiquarium in Rome, Villa Albani and in Side. There is probably also a statuette, sold at Sotheby's in 1977. The Farnese Athena is known in fewer copies: one statue in the Louvre, and two heads, one in Dresden, the other in the Torlonia collection in Rome. Finally, a mixture of the Hope and Farnese statues is seen in two heads, in Lecce and the Vatican magazine, and in a statue in Ptolemais. Their places of origin span from Asia Minor to the Athenian Akropolis and across to Italy. It is therefore probable that the original was a celebrated and popular statue in the whole of the Mediterranean area. The Hope/Farnese type is characterized as a standing Athena, identified by the helmet and aegis, wearing an ankle-length chiton, a himation which is draped round the whole body and fastened on the right shoulder, and sandals. Athena rests her weight on her right leg and has the left leg relaxed, set slightly to the side and back, with the foot turned outwards. The right arm was presumably held down, and the left raised and extended to the side, as far as one can judge from the position of the remains of the shoulders and upper arms. The aegis covers the shoulders and reaches down below the breasts. It is bordered by twining snakes and has the head of Medusa in the middle. The Attic helmet is decorated by a seated sphinx on top and a griffin at each side, the latter partly in relief. The hair is parted in the middle, carried back and swept under the helmet close to the ears. It then reappears 1149 Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 51.18.12, cat. no.

Two long curls fall down by each side of the neck and on to the breast. The fine material of the chiton which reaches to the ground is represented by a wealth of small crinkles. The cloak, a diplax, is made of a very large piece of material which is folded over, giving a double thickness over the trunk and upper legs; two corners are visible at the front. It is open on the right side and fastened on the right shoulder, from where the characteristic heavy folds of cloth fall. The head is turned slightly to the goddess's right and looks down. The features are severe and forceful. The brows are sharply moulded, the eyes are large with thick lids, the nose is broad and straight. The mouth is quite small with full lips, and the cheeks and chin are full. The differences between the Hope and Farnese Athenas and their replicas are for the most part very minor. They are not so much typological as stylistic, and can be attributed to different workmanship.1152 Nevertheless, two differences in the treatment of the helmet and the hair stand out: the Hope Athena has her hair hanging in loose locks on to her shoulders, whereas the Farnese Athena has corkscrew curls hanging down below the helmet and just touching the shoulders. The helmet of the latter has the cheek-pieces raised high, whereas the Hope Athena has a small low-relief volute over each ear below the sphinx. For an assessment of the origin and the dating of the type, the most obvious subject for comparison is the Athena Parthenos. The helmet's decoration is clearly derived from that of the Parthenos. The stance of the Parthenos, however, is more rigid, with the relaxed left leg hardly causing any movement, while the Hope Athena has a more relaxed pose generally and this is emphasized by the turn of the head. The drapery folds of the Hope Athena are also richer and less column-like. The Parthenon frieze and pediments provide better comparisons, as both Preyss and Mathiopoulos suggest.1153 Therefore, the original of the Athena Hope should perhaps be dated to the period 440-430 BC approximately.1154 The fact that the Athena Hope and the Athena Farnese are so very similar, despite differences in certain details, probably means that the two are variants of the same original statue. Mathiopoulos has attempted to determine whether the Hope or the Farnese statue is the more trustworthy in relation to the original, but her findings are not conclusive.1155 The Farnese statue is in general believed to be the older of the two, dating from the Augustan period. This has led a number of scholars to believe that it is the more reliable copy.1156 On the other hand, the Hope Athena has been copied more often than the Farnese, suggesting to some that this work is more faithful to the original statue, which was clearly both famous and popular. But whether the fact that the Hope statue has been copied more often has any bearing on the matter is not known, as it may simply reflect a preference of the Roman period. 1152 So Mathiopoulos (1968) 62-69. Furtwängler (1895/1964) 78, preferred to distinguish between the Athena Hope, which he attributed to Pheidias, and the Athena Farnese, which he attributed to a pupil of Pheidias, an artist "on less intimate terms with nature than the creator of the Hope type". 1153 Preyss (1912) 88-128 and Mathiopoulos (1968) 104-05. 1 154 Cf. Boardman (1985a) fig. 206. He dates the type to the early 4th century BC. 1 155 See Canciani in LI MC II (1984) Athena/Minerva no. 148. 1 156 This was already the opinion of Studniczka (1899) 134.</page><page sequence="461">ATHENA HOPE/F ARNESE 443 A different statue type which is related to the Athena Hope/F arnese is the Athena Albani.1157 In this case there are clear divergences between the two types. The chiton, cloak and aegis are quite similar, but the pose is different. The Athena Albani rests her weight on her right leg, while the left is relaxed and set to the side rather than back. Furthermore, she has her right arm raised and the left lowered, in reverse order to the Hope/Farnese type. The Hope/Farnese Athena therefore shows a more advanced stance, inspired perhaps by the works of Polykleitos. It is doubtful whether the Albani statue preserves its original head and there are no other copies of the type. She wears a wolf-head cap and this is considered to belong to the original by many scholars.1158 But the head is not securely related to the statue and the whole attribution is tentative.1159 The reason for including and discussing the Athena Albani in relation to the Athena Hope/Farnese is that the statue is considered by some to be the prototype of the Athena Hope/Farnese and to be a closer reflection of the original statue.1160 The Athena Albani can also be compared with the Parthenon sculptures, in particular the north metopes 25 and 32, which should date the original in the 440s BC. Contrary to several scholars, Boardman downdates the statue to about 430-420 BC, commenting on the Parthenonian dress and features, in particular the himation selvage, and he suggests that perhaps the Athena Hope/Farnese, which he dates to the early 4th century BC, is "derived" from the Athena Albani.1161 15.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The Athena Hope and the Athena Farnese, which are thought to be variants of the same type, have been identified by scholars in many different ways because of their stylistic similarities with a variety of sculptures. The Hope Athena was originally believed to be a copy of the Athena Parthenos, until the discovery of the Varvakeion Athena.1162 The similarities with the Parthenos, particularly in the type of helmet, then led to the suggestion that the statue was inspired by the Parthenos and perhaps even created by Pheidias as well. It does seem likely that the Hope/Farnese type was produced not much later than the Parthenos, but whether it was by Pheidias himself or by a pupil or associate sculptor remains to be determined. 1157 Rome, Villa Albani 1012, cat. no. (15) D. 1 158 For example, Linfert (1989) no. 135. 1159 Mathiopoulos (1968) 72-75. 1160 Mathiopoulos (1968) 103, with references, and Despinis (1971) 146-55. Palagia (1989) 330, writes that the Albani is "generally considered to be the prototype of the Athena Hope/Farnese", and that the latter was "created ten or twenty years later". See also Boardman (1985a) fig. 206. 1161 Boardman (1985a) figs. 201 and 206. Ridgway (1981) 173 also favours a lower date for the Hope/Farnese type. 1162 Athens, NM 129, cat. no. (6) 6.</page><page sequence="462">444 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Following Furtwängler, Preyss suggested that the original of the statue was perhaps the third Athena of Pheidias mentioned by Pliny, in NH 34.54, a bronze statue which he says was taken to Rome by Aemilius Paullus and set up in the Temple of the Fortune of the Day. This suggestion was originally made by Furtwängler, but Preyss elaborated on the idea by emphasizing that all the replicas were from Rome or the surrounding area.1163 This no longer holds true, as the fragments from Athens and Side indicate.1164 The thorough investigation of the Area Sacra by Coarelli, and Martin's discussion of the cult image and of the statues mentioned by Pliny in front of and inside the temple, rule out the possibility that the Hope Athena type was the cult statue.1165 From the surviving fragments of the colossal acrolithic statue of Fortuna it is clear that, despite a comparable pose - with the figure standing on her right leg, the left relaxed and set to the side and slightly back, and the head turned gently to the figure's right - the head is completely different from that of the Hope/Farnese type.1166 The date of the circular temple, known as Temple 'B', is around 100 BC, and it was at this time that the cult statue base was also created. It should be noted that the date of the temple excludes any link with the famous Aemilius Paullus, as the temple was not constructed until well after his death. The position of the cognomen in front of the nomen indicates, however, that the person was a member of the same family. Coarelli attempts to attribute the temple statue to Scopas Minor and this is cautiously supported by Martin, though he finds no decisive evidence for the attribution. Martin uses the Farnese Athena to illustrate a possible reconstruction of the pondération of the original statue, but he finally settles for the pose of the Demeter from Eleusis, with the left arm in the position of the 'Demokratia' in Athens. The right arm, of which there are remains, was bent and held a cornucopia. A different suggestion, concerning the statue set up in the Temple of the Fortune of the Day, comes from Linfert who identifies it as the Athena of Pellene by Pheidias, but this theory remains tenuous since the iconography of the Athena of Pellene has not yet been established for certain.1 167 Pliny, NH. 34.60, says that there were at the temple of the Fortune of the Day, in addition to the statue of Athena by Pheidias, seven nude statues and a statue of an old man, all made by Pythagoras of Samos. These are thought to have been the Seven against Thebes and Amphiaraos or Halitherses. Inside the temple there were two statues wearing cloaks and a naked colossos, all attributed to Pheidias by Pliny, in NH 34.54. These statues were, he says, dedicated by Catulus. A remaining possibility is that the Athena statue placed in front of the temple was by Pheidias and that it was this work which was the original of the Hope/Farnese type, but this is mere hypothesis as nothing in detail is known about the external statue. 1163 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 76-80; Preyss (1912) 128. 1164 Athens, Akropolis Museum, 3371, 112, 2919, cat. no.

For a discussion of the Athena of Pellene, see chapter 7.</page><page sequence="463">ATHENA HOPE/FARNESE 445 Studniczka wanted to associate the Athena Hope/F arnese with the statue of Athena Hygieia by Pyrrhos in the Propylaia on the Athenian Akropolis.1168 A base has been found for this statue and it still has the marks of the position of the feet.1169 But, according to Mathiopoulos, these do not fit exactly with the feet of any of the Athena Hope/Farnese copies and she refutes the theory.1170 The evidence for or against appears inconclusive. The Hope/Farnese Athena has also been interpreted as a copy of Alkamenes's Athena in the Hephaisteion, dated to 421/420-416/415 BC according to the building inscriptions. This view was taken by Langlotz, and elaborated by Mathiopoulos, but Harrison has argued against it.1171 Despinis presented yet another theory concerning the Athena Hope/Farnese type.1172 He identified the type as a copy of the Athena Itonia in Koroneia by Agorakritos, and associated it closely with the Dresden Zeus which he identified as copying the Hades/Zeus in the same sanctuary. By stylistic comparison with the Dresden Zeus, the Nemesis from Rhamnous and figure L in the Parthenon's east pediment, Despinis suggested a date in the period 440-430 BC for the original of the Athena Hope/Farnese. Of the two head types, he considered the Farnese version to be more Agorakritan, linking it with that of the Hera Borghese-Barberini type, while the Hope head was felt to be closer in style to the Athena Lemnia and Athena Parthenos. Karanastassis has followed Despinis in identifying the Athena Hope/Farnese as the Athena Itonia by Agorakritos. She mainly discusses the Akropolis fragments, but she finds no decisive arguments to settle the matter.1173 It is sometimes suggested that it is not the Hope/Farnese type but the Albani Athena, generally believed to be a completely separate and earlier type, which reflects the Athena Itonia by Agorakritos.1174 Furtwängler rejected the identification of the Athena Albani with the Athena Itonia of Koroneia by Agorakritos, on the grounds that the type was too early for a pupil of Pheidias. Nevertheless, he maintained that the head gear of the Albani Athena could be associated with the underworld and Hades, with whom Athena Itonia was worshipped in her sanctuary in Koroneia.1175 Therefore, he identified the Albani Athena as another Athena Itonia in Athens ( CIA i. 210) perhaps made by Praxias the pupil of Kalamis. This would make the work contemporary with Pheidias.1176 Despinis too rules 1168 Studniczka (1899) 134-35. 1169 Raubitschek (1949) 523 no. 166; cf. Ashmole (1927) 7. 1170 yjļe measurements have supposedly been checked by Mathiopoulos (1968) 105-06, contrary to the information given by Palagia (1989) 331. 1171 Langlotz (1952) 1 1-13; Mathiopoulos (1968) 1 10; Harrison (1977) 138-39, 145-46. 1172 Despinis (1971). 1173 Karanastassis (1987) 382-83. 1 1 Ią See Boardman (1985a) fig. 201. 1175 See Strabo 9.2.29; but Pausanias, IX.34.1, says that with the Athena Itonia was a statue not of Hades but of Zeus. 1176 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 80-81.</page><page sequence="464">446 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS out the association of the Albani Athena with the Athena Itonia of Koroneia as he does not believe the head and body belong together and in general finds the style too early, almost severe, for a work by Agorakritos. Linfert agrees that it is perhaps correct to doubt the association of the head and body of the Albani Athena, despite Fuchs's views to the contrary.1177 Whatever the identity of the Albani Athena, its Parthenonian dress and features are striking. It should be mentioned that Palagia has chosen to use a variant of the Albani Athena with the Dresden Zeus in the centre of her reconstruction of the east pediment of the Parthenon "merely as convenient types in Parthenon style".1178 15.3. CATALOGUE (A) ATHENA HOPE 1. ATHENA HOPE (Fig. 15.1) Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 51.18.12. Statue. Athena Hope. H. 2.18m. Body, Pentelic marble; head, Parian marble. From Ostia, Tor Boacciana. 2nd century AD. Both arms are almost completely missing. The upper parts of the sphinx and griffins on the helmet, the eyes, some of the snakes on the aegis, the chin and nose of the Gorgon's head, and the end of some toes on the right foot had been restored in Carrara marble. These restorations were removed during conservation work in 1974. The statue was found at Tor Boacciana, Ostia, in 1797, during excavations carried out by the Irish painter Robert Fagan. The statue was acquired by Thomas Hope, for whom the extensive restorations were made, probably in Rome. It was displayed in the Hope Statue Gallery at Duchess Street, London, from 1804-1849, and then removed to Deepdene, Dorking, in 1849 by Henry Thomas Hope, and displayed there in a niche in the Orangery or Sculpture Room until 1917. In the Hope sale of 1917 at Christie's, it fetched the highest price of all the antiquities, being purchased for 6,800 guineas (£7,140) by Agnew, acting for Viscount Cowdray. In 1933 it was on sale at Sotheby's, but this time fetched only £200. Later it was sold to William Randolph Hearst who kept it on his San Simeon estate. Following his death in 1951, the statue was donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was placed on loan in the John Paul Getty Museum at Malibu in 1973, where it was fully conserved before being returned to the Los Angeles Museum in 1986. This over life-size statue of a standing Athena gives its name to the Hope type. The head, which was made separately and inserted, is turned slightly to the figure's right and looks down. Athena wears an ankle-length chiton and a himation with a long overfold, which is draped round the whole body, passing under the left arm and fastened on the right shoulder. She also wears thick-soled sandals. Athena rests her weight on her right leg and has the left leg relaxed, with the foot set back and turned outwards. Both feet stand flat on the ground. To judge from the position of the shoulders and the remains of the upper arms, 1177 Linfert (1989) 432, no. 135; for the opinions of Fuchs see Helbig (1972) no. 3243. 1178 Palagia (1993) 29, fig. 20.</page><page sequence="465">ATHENA HOPE/F ARNESE 447 it seems probable that the right arm was held down, while the left was extended to the side. The aegis, which is of the double, symmetrical type, covers both shoulders and extends below the breasts. Its scalloped edge is bordered by twining snakes and its surface is decorated with a scale pattern. In the centre is a broad gorgoneion. The face of Medusa is ugly but not monstrous, and it is framed by wavy hair. The Attic helmet is decorated with a seated sphinx on top and a pair of griffins, one on either side, the latter partly executed in relief. The foreparts of the beasts do not quite reach to the helmet browband. The browband ends in a large scroll motif on each side. The hair is parted in the middle, carried back and swept under the helmet close to the ears. It then reappears below the helmet at the back of the neck in a broad mass which is tied at shoulder level and then falls in six long ringlets. Two long locks fall forwards on each side of the upper torso at the front. The fine material of the chiton, which reaches to the ground, is represented by a wealth of small crinkly folds. The cloak, a diplax , is made of a very large piece of cloth folded over. Two weighted corners are visible at the front, falling from the cloth fastened on the right shoulder. The arrangement of the folds of the cloak is very distinctive, with heavy, perpendicular folds emphasizing the supporting right leg on the open side of the garment, and contrasting with the angular modelling folds which pull round the outline of the left side of the body and relaxed left leg, to delineate the figure. The face is long and oval in shape. The cheeks and chin are full and rounded, giving the goddess a youthful look. The mouth is quite small with full lips. The almond-shaped eyes, which are set quite high in the face, are soft and fine, and the nose is broad and straight. This statue is one of the best examples of the type, even if not the oldest.

The head and neck, which were separately worked, are now missing, as are part of the upper torso and shoulder, both the arms and the sleeves of the chiton, and one corner of the himation, all of which were restored following the Farnese Athena. The statue was found on the Velabrum, Rome, in the early 1890s and acquired by the Glyptotek in 1904. The pose and drapery of this statue conform closely to the type of the Athena Hope, though the rather poor workmanship fails to represent the fine texture of the chiton, which looks heavy. The folds of the himation are also coarse and angular in their treatment. The layout of the folds leading down to the corner of the mantle overfold and in the chiton under the left arm are closer to the Farnese than the Hope statue. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Mathiopoulos, E.

Provenance unknown. AD 150-200. The torso has been broken at about hip level and put together again, the break smoothed over with plaster. The head, with restored nose and helmet, does not belong. The upper part of the torso, with the whole aegis and the arms and chiton sleeves, have been restored, as have been the edge of the cloak and the hair at the neck. The statue was earlier in the Italian Embassy in St. Petersburg, which was located in the Demidow Palace. This gave rise to the name the 'Demidow' Athena for this statue. The pose and drapery of this statue are heavily influenced by the Athena Hope type, though the differences show that this is a free imitation. The raised heel of the left foot, the slightly shorter chiton, which does not touch the ground between the feet and the absence of the front corner of the himation overfold, which can be seen clearly on the Hope and Copenhagen examples of the type, are all deviations from the type. Mathiopoulos attributes this more to the incompetence of the sculptor than any attempt to create a variation on the type. The mantle overfold is quite similar to that of the Louvre statue, another work of mediocre quality. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Mathiopoulos, E. (1968) 56-57. Preyss, A. (1912) 1 15-17, no. 8, fig. 26.

The lower part of the statue, up to about the hips, is preserved and incorporated into a portrait statue of a Flavian woman. The mantle and the upper left leg have been worked over. Earlier in the Palazzo Barberini, the torso was then in the possession of Camuccini, from whom it was bought by the Vatican. The position of the feet and the fine chiton, covered with the thick himation, points to the fact that this fragment comes from a replica of the Athena Hope type. But the corners of the himation are not shown, and its folds are much flatter than on, say, the Hope statue. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Amelung, W. (1903) 75-76, no. 56, pl. 9. Mathiopoulos, E. (1968) 53-54.

There is severe damage to the facial features and to the details of the helmet. The front of the face, including the eyebrows, the forehead, nose, mouth, chin, and a piece of the hair on the left side have been restored. The sphinx is missing from the helmet, and the griffins on either side are broken away. The head was newly restored in 1996. Formerly in the Cook Collection in Richmond, the piece was purchased at auction in 1948 by Mrs. E. Vermeule and presented to University College London. The head and neck of this helmeted female conform to the type of the Athena Hope. Despite its damaged appearance, the type is recognizable from the slight turn of the head to the figure's right, and from the hairstyle and helmet type. The hair is characteristically arranged so that it is parted in the middle, with waves of hair on either side of the forehead descending to the ears and disappearing under the helmet. At the back the broad tress can be seen, confined by a band. At the front shoulder locks come down from the helmet on each side. The Attic helmet bears the traces of the central reclining sphinx at the top and much of the griffins in relief on either side. The face is too heavily restored to say more than that it has slender cheeks. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Mathiopoulos, E. (1968) 58-59. Michaelis, A. (1882) 633, no. 50. Preyss, A. (1912) 108-09, no. 1.

The head was found in Ostia together with two other fragments, which may possibly belong to the same statue though none of the pieces join directly: part of one shoulder with the aegis and a fragment of an arm. The over life-size head is of the Athena Hope type, as can be seen from the hairstyle, with the broad tress at the neck and the waves of hair parted at the middle and descending to the ears at the front. Also typical is the Attic helmet with griffins in relief on each side. Uncharacteristic features include the lack of shoulder locks at the front and the rather narrow head. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Andreae, B.

The nose and part of the neck, the unusual, projecting flaps on either side of the helmet, and much of the shoulder locks are restored. The head is strongly polished. In 1992 the head was still fitted to an archaistic statue of Athena Promachos, to which it does not belong. The head is of the Athena Hope type, recognizable from the helmet and hairstyle. The helmet is of the typical Attic sort with peaked browband and animals decorating the top, partly executed in relief. Despite the addition of projecting flaps, which give a very odd appearance to the helmet, a scroll motif terminating the browband can be seen above the ears, executed in low relief. This follows the Hope statue. The hair is arranged with the typical thick tress at the back, twin locks coming down over the shoulders at the front and waves of hair on the brow, parted in the middle and reaching the ears before being tucked back into the helmet. But the treatment of the face lacks strength and clarity, with soft modelling of the areas around the eyes and narrow lips on the slightly opened mouth. In addition, the head turns slightly to the figure's left, rather than to the right. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Mathiopoulos, E. (1968) 48-69, 102-108. Moscato, S. (1992) 90-91, fig. 96. Preyss, A.

The head is quite corroded. The lips, chin, nose, eyebrows, the hair by the left temple and at the back, and much of the decoration on the helmet have been damaged. The griffin on the right side is quite well preserved. It was found in the garden of a Capuchin monastery near the Via della Sale. Formerly housed in the Antiquarium on the Caelius. The head is of the Athena Hope type, identifiable by the helmet and hairstyle. Unlike other copies of the type, this one has raised, tab-like flaps above the ears. They are undecorated, but they correspond with the scroll motif ending the browband on the Hope and Albani heads. The face is depicted with strong features, a wide mouth and sharply lidded eyes.

The head was heavily restored in the 1 8th century. It was fitted on an alabaster statuette to which it does not belong. The sphinx and griffins on the helmet, the neck and bust fitting have all been restored. The head was apparently found in the Farnese Gardens on the Palatine. The head is of the Athena Hope type, as can be seen from the Attic form of the helmet with peaked browband and the waved hair parted at the centre. This copy lacks the shoulder locks, and the style of execution says more about its early Imperial date than about the appearance of the original. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Bol, P. C.

Body, Pentelic marble; head, Parian marble. Found near Rome. AD 1-14. The statue is in good condition. Restorations include the arms, the animals on the helmet, the cheek-pieces, some of the snakes on the aegis, the neck and some of the drapery folds. The nose is slightly damaged. It was found not far from Rome in 1743, and restored by Cavaceppi in Carrara marble. First found in the Naples Museum inventory in 1805. This over life-size statue of a standing Athena is in the pose and drapery of the Athena Hope type, but showing certain differences, particularly in the treatment of the helmet and hair. The helmet has large, raised cheek-pieces and, instead of flanking griffins beside the central sphinx, it has pegasoi rendered almost fully in the round. Another difference is that the foreparts of the reclining sphinx stretch out as far as the browband. The two archaic- style locks falling forward on to the aegis of the Hope type are replaced on the Farnese Athena with tight, corkscrew locks on either side of the neck and just touching the shoulders. The waves of parted hair on the forehead are maintained, yet the angle formed by the parted hair on the forehead is more obtuse than on the Hope statue. The hair at the back is differently arranged too, for instead of the broad mass of hair tied with a ribbon, the Farnese Athena has five tight ringlets hanging down from the helmet. The face is more forceful, with a fuller and wider chin, a wider mouth, and sharper eyes set slightly lower down in the head. The helmet has a bigger diameter than that of the Hope statue. The hair of the Gorgon on the aegis is also treated differently. Instead of being wavy, as on the Hope statue, it appears to be arranged in parallel, frizzy strands. The proportions of the Farnese statue are generally heavier than those of the Hope statue. The relaxed leg is set more to the side and not so far back. The aegis is noticeably broader and longer. The treatment of the folds, both on the chiton and the mantle, is inferior, for the folds are flatter, and more angular. Although the arms are restored, they may point to the original action of the goddess, holding an attribute in her right hand and an upright lance in her left. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Canciani, F.

LOUVRE ATHENA FARNESE STATUE Paris, Louvre, MA 331. Statue. Marble. Provenance unknown. 3rd century AD. The statue is fitted with the wrong head type. It has been restored with modern arms. Part of the sleeves have been restored too. The pose and hairstyle of this statue resemble those of the Farnese Athena. There are remains of the typical five locks at the back of the head, though these may have been a little shorter than on the Farnese statue, and the left leg is set out to the side, even further in fact than in the case of the Farnese Athena. But the statue is not so broad in its proportions and the folds leading to the front corner of the mantle overfold, which are a distinctive feature of both the Farnese and Hope statues, do not follow the characteristic pattern. The himation folds are flatter and less well rendered. The folds of the chiton sleeves, as well as those on the left foot, are also treated much more simply. The folds are generally closer to those of the Hermitage statue, but of lesser quality. Another difference may be observed in the aegis, which has a raised border and hardly any snakes.

The upper parts of the sphinx on the helmet are broken away, as is the nose. There are also small chips in the surface of the face, the hair and the helmet browband. The back of the helmet, the neck and the right side of the head are all missing. The head is of the Farnese Athena type, as can be seen from the remains of a ringlet on the left side of the head, the strong chin, and the signs of damage to the helmet at the place where the cheek-pieces have broken off. The helmet still bears part of its central sphinx and the fact that the beast's foreparts touch the browband is another indication that this is a replica of the Farnese rather than the Hope head type.

In the handling of the folds and drapery, it is more akin to the Hope statue, but in its proportions it is closer to the Farnese. The left knee is not so widely bent as that of the Farnese, but the leg is set further back, as in the Hope statue.

The volume of the head and helmet are as wide as that of the Farnese, but the face is narrower. The eyes are set high, like the Farnese eyes, but in execution they are closer to the Hope eyes. The mouth, chin and neck are like those of the Farnese, but the nose is narrower and shorter. The hair on the temples is like that of the Hope statue.

The statue is in good condition, though the left forearm and the right arm up to the level of the mid upper arm are missing. The end of the left foot and much of the plinth have been restored. The arms and head were inserted, and it is not certain that the head belongs to the original statue. On the head the nose and the lips are restored, as is the animal snout on the wolfs head cap. The sculpture comes from the Albani Collection, but its earlier provenance is uncertain. This statue of Athena shows similarities in pose and garb with the Hope/Farnese type, but it is different enough to be regarded as a separate, and probably earlier, type. Athena wears an ankle-length chiton of finely folded cloth beneath a long, thick diplax which is fastened on the right shoulder. She also wears thick-soled sandals and a similar front- opening aegis with the broad-faced gorgoneion in the middle and plastically rendered snakes twining around the edge. In this type, however, the diplax is somewhat longer, with the lower fold reaching to the ankles and the overfold reaching to below the left knee. The layout of the folds is, as a consequence, rather different, although the pattern of strong perpendicular folds on the right side contrasting with strong modelling lines on the left side, is present. There is also a difference in the handling of the folds over the left ankle. In the case of the Hope/Farnese type, modelling lines on clinging drapery are used, whereas in the Albani statue the tight pleats of material between the feet are continued over the left ankle, thus largely hiding its form. The himation selvage is indicated, in Parthenonian manner. Another difference is the much richer treatment of the folds of the chiton on the left side, where they overhang the cloak. This feature is partly called for by the different pose, but it gives a very different effect and one which again recalls strongly the sculptures of the Parthenon. Turning to the pose, one finds major differences between the two types. The weight-bearing leg is still the right but, whereas in the Hope/Farnese type the left leg is</page><page sequence="474">456 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS set to the side and back, with the left foot set fully on the ground, the Albani Athena has the left foot set to the side but not to the back and the heel is very slightly raised. Furthermore, she has the right arm, rather than the left, raised and extended away from the body, while the left is lowered and bent at the elbow. This pose is, therefore less advanced than that of the Hope/Farnese type. The head, which was made separately and which may not belong, shows a youthful Athena with short, curly hair beneath a wolf-head cap. There are no known copies of this type.

THE ATHENA MEDICI TYPE The so-called Athena Medici statue type is composed of two famous pieces of sculpture: a torso in the Louvre from the Medici Collection (Fig. 16.1), and the 'Carpegna' head in the Terme museum in Rome (Fig. 16.3).1179 The association is confirmed by the existence of a complete statue in Sevilla, Casa de Pilatos 839, the only statue of the type to preserve the original head. Many copies are associated with this type. At least thirty replicas are known, and these include statues, heads, statuettes and reliefs (see also figs. 16.2, 4-5). All the statues of the type are consistent in their depiction of the pose. Athena stands with her weight on her left leg, the right leg relaxed and set to the side. Only the toes of the left foot can be seen, while more than half of the right foot is apparent beneath the drapery.1180 The upper arms are both held down, and set at some distance from the body. The upper body leans slightly to the right, and the head also turns in this direction, a movement which is confirmed by the three Venus rings on the neck, which appear slightly towards the right side on all the preserved heads, by the uneven facial features and by the displacement of the hair on the neck to left of centre on some of the preserved heads.1 181 The goddess wears a chiton, a peplos and a himation. She has thick-soled sandals on her feet. The peplos is open on the right side, and has a long overfold with an uneven hemline. It is tied at the waist with a belt, sometimes in the shape of a Herakles knot.1182 The chiton is visible on the right leg in all but two cases, revealed in the opening of the peplos by the movement of the leg.1183 In several cases, the chiton can also be seen at the neckline, on the right shoulder and under the arms. There is some variation in the depiction of the cloak, which falls over the left shoulder, with smaller or larger swathes falling forward, and a horizontal line or a tapering edge marking the lower limits of the garment at the back of the 11 79 parjSj Louvre, 3070, cat. no.

The cloak is carried over the left shoulder in the manner of a soldier on the march, as Harrison points out.1184 Athena is characterized by the Attic helmet on her head and the aegis on her chest. The helmet has a broad border at the front which often has holes above for attachments. The lower edge of the border points down towards the nose. There is also a raised border on the neck-piece. The helmet originally had a central crest, as well as side crests, and cheek-pieces.1185 The aegis, which is adorned with a gorgoneion in the middle and incised scales, is generally shown to open at the front, in the manner of that of the Parthenos, and to be quite short, reaching to the level of the breasts. The face has large, heavy features with broad cheeks, a massive chin, big eyes with pronounced lids, a broad, straight nose, and full lips in an otherwise small, open mouth. Sometimes teeth are depicted. The ears are pierced for earrings on several copies.1186 The hair, which is parted at the centre, is visible at the temples, emerging from beneath the helmet. On some copies it is carried back towards the ears in waves. On others, tiny holes along the temple and forehead indicate that the hair was attached separately.1187 Harrison suggests that the original had short side curls in the manner of the Athena Parthenos.1188 At the back of the head, the hair reappears in a broad mass below the helmet, where it is held in a bunch by one or two ribbons. A little more than half of the replicas carry, or carried, a shield on the left arm, suggesting that this was indeed the attribute of the left arm.1189 There is less certainty about what the goddess carried in her right hand, and the two replicas which may assist in this matter are the right hand in Thessaloniki and the 'Ambelokipi' relief. The former appears to have held a cylindrical object, probably a spear, whereas the latter holds a patera in the right hand, and a spear in the left hand. The 'Ambelokipi' relief diverges in several respects from other replicas of the type, while the Thessaloniki fragments are very close to other examples of the type.1190 This suggests that the Thessaloniki fragment is more likely to be correct in the matter of the attribute of the right hand too. 1184 Harrison (1996) 58. 1185 Remains of side crests can be observed on Sevilla 839; the Thessaloniki fragment; the 'Hartwig' head; and Athens, Akropolis Museum relief, 2426, cat nos.

Not all scholars, however, are in agreement on this point and it is possible that the size of the replicas reflects a convenient scaling down of an even more colossal original of which full- scale copies would have been impractical or undesirable.1192 In the case of the Athena Parthenos, we know that replicas of various scales were made: the Athena Varvakeion is approximately one-twelfth the size of the Athena Parthenos, whereas the Priene Athena was about half the size and the Pergamon Library Athena about one-third the size. There are a number of smaller copies of the Medici type too, as one would expect for a large original. One should note that a height of over 3m is uncommonly large for a copy of a statue of a divinity and it certainly suggests an important prototype. It is not only the size and general appearance of the replicas that are homogeneous, but also the details of the drapery. Characteristic folds of the peplos include the V-shape on the upper body above the belt, the upturned V below the aegis, columnar, fluted folds on the left side over the supporting leg, and a wavy line by the peplos opening, created by the peplos overfold. The corner of the peplos, that has been pulled above the belt and hangs down under the arm pit, creates a distinctive, roughly triangular shape on almost all the copies, including several of the statuettes. The chiton over the right leg is also treated in a very uniform manner in the copies. In particular the thin, crinkly folds of the cloth, rendered as small, vertical incisions, stand in strong contrast with heavier, more volumetric U-shaped folds that are used to indicate the movement of the leg beneath the cloth. Three sculptures listed in the catalogue which stand out from the rest because of their nonconformity to the type in certain important respects are the Berlin statuette, the Ambelokipi relief, and the Eleusis bust. The Berlin statuette has two long ringlets hanging down on either side of the breasts, in the manner of Archaic korai, and it wears a very long aegis. The figure on the Ambelokipi relief has the peplos open on the left side rather than the right. The Eleusis bust, with its very pronounced facial features, and a large and very ornate aegis, distinguishes itself from all the other replicas. But this is perhaps unsurprising, considering that it was incorporated into an architectural setting. Because of these differences from the type, these three pieces are probably better thought of as versions of the type rather than true replicas. The Ambelokipi relief is known only from two line drawings, since its present whereabouts are unknown. Other works listed in the catalogue which are also impossible to study at present are the statuette formerly in the Athens, Akropolis Museum, perhaps no. 2684, which has not been seen since 1880, and the statuette formerly in the Gorga collection in Rome, which cannot be traced with certainty either. The Athena Medici has many similarities with the Athena Parthenos in its stance and style, though there are also some major differences between the two statue types. The motion of the right leg is in some copies transmitted to the upper body which suggests that 1 191 See Lundgreen (1997a) AR 24, 9, fig. 2. 1 l^z Langlotz (1960) 169; Strocka (2004) 5. v. Pheidias, section on Athena Promachos, 215ff.</page><page sequence="479">462 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the type is more developed than that of the Parthenos.1193 The drapery is softer and more transparent than that of the Parthenos, and the relaxed leg is bent much more sharply, "giving a greater ease to the attitude", to quote Richter.1194 The two statue types also differ in that the Medici is more war-like than the Parthenos, with her raised shield and spear held at the ready. Karanastassis points out that the defensively held shield is on the motionless left side, whereas the more actively clutched spear is on the active right side.1195 This is another feature which is not seen in the Parthenos. On the basis of close similarities with the style of the Parthenon pediments, and Furtwängler's dating of the Athena Medici type after the Athena Lemnia and the Athena Parthenos, most scholars tend to agree that the work was originally made in the 430s BC.1196 Strocka, on the other hand, seeks to update the Medici type to the 460s BC, pointing to the style of the head and the drapery for evidence.1197 The compactness of the head and its heavy chin, and the stiff folds of the goddess's peplos are, he thinks, not incompatible with an Early Classical work. And whereas most scholars argue that a later date is indicated by the parallel between the crisp and restless folds of the chiton and the drapery of the Parthenon pediments, Strocka finds a precedent for these folds in the drapery of the youth from Motya, which he dates shortly after 480 BC.1 198 The replicas were made using various techniques.1199 While the torsos in Paris and Sevilla were carved out of a single block of stone, the Thessaloniki fragments and the Cyrene and Chigi legs were made separately for insertion into over life-size statues. In some cases, one also finds separately attached hands and feet, separately made helmet tops, inserted eyes and attached earrings. One copy even had an ivory face and limbs. Such piecing together has suggested that the works were acrolithic and that they were imitating a chryselephantine or acrolithic original.1200 This still remains to be proved. Inserted arms, heads, eyes, and separate helmet tops are not uncommon in Roman copies of Greek bronze originals. In three of the larger copies the right leg is made in one piece with the rest of the torso. This is the case in the best example of the type, the Athena d'Ingres in the Louvre. A good block of marble was expensive and it was common practice for Roman sculptors to 19-3 Langlotz (1972/1974) observes that this feature is not seen before 445 BC. 1 194 Richter (1950) 106; along the same lines: Berger (1965) 86. 1195 Karanastassis (1987) 342^3. 1196 Furtwängler (1893) 45ff. and 54; Amelung (1908) 188ff.; Boardman (1985) fig. 200; Harrison (1996) 58. A dissenting voice is that of Ridgway (1981) 170, who is of the opinion that the indisputably Parthenonian character of the type may be due to no more than the selectiveness of the Roman sculptor. She is tempted to classify the Athena Medici as a Greek or Roman invention in "Greek Classical idiom". 1 197 Strocka (2004) s. v.

It is often suggested that an obvious technique for copying chryselephantine statues is the acrolithic, which would give a similar effect at a fraction of the cost. But whether this was commonly practised in reality is not known, and the evidence from Pheidias's Athena Parthenos and Zeus at Olympia makes one doubt the validity of the assertion. These statues are perhaps special cases, considering their enormous size. Large-scale copies of these works are rare indeed, almost unheard of in the case of the Zeus, but, amongst the wealth of copies of the Parthenos, only one is known to have been an acrolith.1202 The natural technique for a Roman copy of a bronze was sculpture in stone, and this is the material of a number of known copies of the Medici type. It therefore seems rash to exclude the possibility that the original of the type was made of bronze. Some positive evidence in favour of this view is the raised shield in the left hand. From the known provenances of the sculpture it is possible to say that the majority of the larger-than-life statues were found in Italy, and the majority of the statuettes in Greece. But replicas were also found in both Asia Minor and Africa, proving that the type was both popular and widespread. Some of the statuettes and reliefs from Greece came from religious contexts. They were probably votive offerings, suggesting that the original statue was used for religious worship.1203 Little is known of the original context of the large-scale copies from Italy, but at least two came from Roman villas.1204 The sculptural fragments in Thessaloniki are interesting as a rare instance of the reuse of a goddess statue for an imperial portrait. The head was reworked in the early 3rd century AD to serve as a portrait of Julia Domna.1205 The replicas date from the Flavian period right down to the 3rd century AD. A number of the acrolithic statues come from Italy and can be dated to the Hadrianic or Antonine periods. 1201 Langlotz (1947) 70. 1202 The statue in the temple of Athena at Priene, cat. no.

ATTRIBUTIONS Because of the obvious similarities between the Medici type and both the later reflections of the Athena Parthenos and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments, the original of the Medici type has been associated with various mid 5th century BC works, attributed to Pheidias or his colleagues. In particular, the type has been associated with the so-called Small Athena Parthenos,1206 mentioned by Himerios, the Athena of the east pediment of the Parthenon,1207 the Athena 'Promachos',1208 the chryselephantine Athena at Elis, by Pheidias or his colleague Kolotes,1209 the Athena Lemnia,1210 and the Athena Areia at Plataia.1211 Decisive evidence in favour of any one of these attributions remains to be found, for in several cases nothing is recorded of the iconography of the works and in others very little is known. The relatively large number of replicas of the type suggests that the original was a famous masterpiece. An important point which Becatti established from the evidence of Attic coins bearing images of the type is that the Medici type must have been well known in Athens. He thought it may even have originated on the Akropolis. This idea is strengthened by the existence of a votive relief from the Akropolis which bears an image of the type standing by an olive tree.1212 Some of the arguments put forward to support or dismiss an attribution centre around the probable size and technique of the original of the Athena Medici. But, as argued in the section above, conclusive evidence on these two matters remains to be found. Himerios reports that before Pheidias made the large Athena Parthenos, he created a small Parthenos on the Akropolis, at Perikles's request.1213 But when Pheidias found that this statue did not give him enough scope, he was told to make it as well as he could and then to turn his full attention to the large Parthenos. It is usually inferred from this passage that the 'Small Parthenos' was made at the same time as the Parthenos and in a similar style, though on a smaller scale. Using the evidence of Roman coins from Attica depicting a very similar Athena to the Medici type, Becatti concluded that Himerios was talking about a fourth statue of Athena by Pheidias on the Akropolis (after the 'Promachos', the Parthenos, and the Lemnia), and that this work was the original of the Medici type.1214 But the problem with the association is the lack of confirmation in any other source for the 1206 Becatti (1951) 181-83. 1207 Furtwängler (1896) 17ff.; Jeppesen (1963) 88; Langlotz (1972/1974). 1208 Linfert (1982) 66-71; Strocka (2004) s. v.

Himerios was writing in the 4th century AD, and his purpose was primarily rhetorical effect. How trustworthy he is with regard to details of art history may be questioned. Becatti's objections to associating Himerios's words with the Athena Lemnia, the existence of which is well documented in the sources, are not very strong, and without further evidence it is not clear that there was a fourth Athena by Pheidias on the Akropolis, as Becatti supposes.1215 The acrolithic Athena Areia at Plataia and the chryselephantine Athena at Elis have both been identified with the original of the Medici type on grounds of authorship and technique. But neither of these works stood in Athens and they were not as prestigious as many other masterpieces, so it seems unlikely that their image would have appeared on Athenian coins and reliefs. Pausanias, IX.4.1, specifies that the Athena Areia was acrolithic, a point which may be of relevance, but he gives no clue about its iconography. He also indicates that it was made on a very large scale. The Athena Areia was an early work by Pheidias, probably produced some time after, perhaps considerably later than, 479BC, but surely before the Athena 'Promachos'. It seems unlikely that the style of the Medici type could be reconciled with such an early date. The authorship of the Eleian statue is not certain. Pliny, NH 35.54, says it was created by Kolotes, an artist who helped Pheidias on the statue of Zeus at Olympia. He adds that the inner surface of the shield was decorated with paintings by Panainos. Pausanias, VI. 26. 3, says it was a chryselephantine statue and attributes the work to Pheidias. He adds that the goddess had a helmet decorated with a cock. In support of the association with the Medici type is the fact that one of the replicas of the Medici type comes from Elis.1216 In addition, the mention of the painted shield might be important. The Athena Medici type can be reconstructed carrying a shield on the left arm. The shield was set in such a way that the inner surface was most visible when the statue was viewed from the front, a position which would have suited a temple image standing in a sanctuary, perhaps with its back close to a wall, as one might imagine was the case for the Athena at Elis. Unfortunately, we do not know whether the image in Elis was shown holding the shield or whether the shield was set on the ground, in the manner of the Athena Parthenos. The Athena at Elis was probably made in the late 430s BC, that is somewhat later than the period when the Parthenon pediments, with which the Medici type is often compared, were being planned. Amongst Classical Athenian statues of Athena associated with Pheidias, of which the iconography is still uncertain, one thinks primarily of the Athena of the east pediment of the Parthenon, the Athena Lemnia and the Athena 'Promachos'. One would not be surprised to find that one of these was the original of the Medici type, a type which inspired many copies, sometimes on a grand scale, and which was well enough known to be used on Attic coins. But the state of the evidence is still not strong enough to provide a clear answer and one can but note some lines of reflection. 1215 For a discussion of this matter, see the relevant passage of Himerios in the Greek sources section. 1216 Athens, NM 3000, cat. no. (16) 20.</page><page sequence="483">466 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Furtwängler's suggestion that the type reflects the lost Athena of the east pediment of the Parthenon was partly based on the coin evidence.1217 Langlotz believed that the Medici type must have been part of a group on the grounds that the statue is not best seen directly from the front but rather slightly from the statue's left so that the goddess's shield and cloak are clearly visible.1218 The outer figures of the east pediment are well preserved but the central figures and those beside them are almost completely lost. Their removal or destruction dates from the construction of an apse at the east end of the building when it was first converted into a Christian church. Pausanias, 1.24.5, at least preserves the subject of the east pediment, which would be incomprehensible to us otherwise, namely the birth of Athena. But he gives no hint about the iconography of the goddess, whom one would expect to have been shown fully grown and armed, in accordance with the myths. There are no known copies of the central scene. The Roman puteal in Madrid Archaeological Museum, 269 1 , which was long thought to reflect the east pediment of the Parthenon, has now been shown to derive from a 4th century BC creation.1219 The Baksy krater in St. Petersburg may reflect something of the composition, but it is clearly not intended to be an accurate copy.1220 Palagia suggests that Athena was probably placed to the left of centre, the position of honour in Archaic and Classical pedimental compositions, with Zeus in the middle followed by Hera. If this were so, then Athena would have occupied the same relative position in both the Parthenon pediments and one would expect a statue of about 3. 15-3. 20m in height. The association of the Athena Lemnia with the Medici type, which is strongly favoured by Harrison, is fully discussed in section 2 of the chapter on the Athena Lemnia.1221 Harrison rightly underlines the weakness of the written evidence for the Athena Lemnia, which provides so few indications about its iconography and which cannot be used to prove of what material it was made nor whether Athena was shown bare-headed. She is also right to doubt that all the sources which talk of a particularly beautiful work by Pheidias necessarily refer to the same statue. She has found evidence in reliefs from Ostia, now in Berlin and Ostia, which show that the iconography of the Medici type is compatible with the idea of the city goddess portrayed as the warrior who is leaving home and making a sacrifice before departure. She suggests that one would expect the Lemnia to be close in style to the Parthenos, if the statues were made within a few years of each other, and she considers that the Medici type is much closer to the Athena Parthenos than the slender Dresden/Bologna type proposed by Furtwängler. More difficult to accept without further evidence is her theory that the statue was merely planned in the 440s BC by Pheidias but not executed until the 430s BC by Agorakritos. It is also not clear that the three secure sources for the Lemnia can be used to prove that the original work was acrolithic, as Harrison believes. 1217 Furtwängler (1896) 17ff. 1218 Langlotz (1972/1974) 148. 1219 Despinis (1982) 104-10. 1220 See Shefton (1992) 245ff. 1221 See Harrison (1996) 52ff.</page><page sequence="484">ATHENA MEDICI 467 Unlike the Athena of the east pediment of the Parthenon or the Athena Lemnia, of which no securely identified images survive, the great bronze Athena can definitely be recognized on a few Roman coins. By their nature, these images are of course very small and rather unclear, and many of the details are lost. Nevertheless, the enormous size of the work, its setting on the Akropolis and the general outlines of dress and pose are confirmed. Pausanias, 1.28.2, states that the goddess had a helmet, a spear and a shield adorned with engravings. Strocka argues in favour of an association with the Medici type because of the impressive number of copies and the apparent connection of the type with Athens and, probably, the Akropolis. For the reasons noted in section 1, he casts strong doubts over the suggestions of other scholars concerning the inferred size and technique of the original of the Medici type, which he regards as a bronze work of about three times the size of the larger Medici type replicas.1222 He is convinced that Niketas Choniates, De Isaac., 738B, gives a description of the statue, confirming the extended right arm and the slight turn of the head in that direction, as well as the aegis with a gorgoneion. The main difficulties in accepting this identification revolve around the pose and attributes of the 'Promachos' and the Medici, and their respective dates. On the earlier and best examples of coins bearing the image of the 'Promachos', one can see that the arm of the relaxed side is held forwards and bears a winged attribute, while the other arm hangs down by the goddess's side. The hand rests on a shield by her side and a spear leans on her left shoulder. In the case of the Medici type, it seems probable that the right arm was extended, but the left arm seems to have been bent at the elbow and the raised shield was held in the left hand. What was held in the right hand is not certain, but it may have been the shaft of an upright spear or a patera. Linfert identifies the Athena 'Promachos' with the Athena type found on Athenian and Attic coins showing the goddess alone with raised shield. According to Linfert, the shield was held, rather than resting on the ground and, as it was very big, it had to be supported from below. He infers that the shield was probably held facing slightly to the back from the fact that Pausanias only describes it on his way back to the Propylaia, rather than when he first saw the statue, as if the incised decorations were not visible from the front. Apparently supporting Linfert' s identification of the Medici torso with the great bronze Athena is the fact that part of the cloak of the Medici torso in the Louvre, which is slightly raised at the back, looks like a pillar support, which could have helped carry the shield. Linfert believes a terrace wall was placed behind the Athena, on which the cloak and, indirectly, the shield rested. An argument against such a theory is that the copy tradition is not unambiguous on this detail.1223 And, as mentioned above, there is no firm proof that these coins do indeed represent the Athena 'Promachos', especially since they do not correspond closely with the coins in group 1 showing the Akropolis view from the north. The 'Promachos' is securely 1222 why the right legs were sometimes inserted in this type remains uncertain and Strocka does not address this issue in particular. Linfert (1982) 57ff. suggests that they reflect the fact that the original right leg was simply cast separately, but this is probably not correct. According to experts in the field of casting and moulding, horizontal rather than vertical divisions would have been made to produce bronzes on this monumental scale. See Lundgreen (1997b) JHS 117, 196 and n. 75. 1223 See, for example, the statues in Sevilla nos. 839 and 840, and the statuette from Elis, Athens, NM 3000, cat. nos.

Most scholars regard this as too early for the Medici type, pointing out the very relaxed position of the right leg, and the thin and delicate folds of the chiton on the right leg and upper arm. Strocka, however, finds parallels for these features, as noted in section 1, in Early Classical works as well as in the earlier carvings of the Parthenon.</page><page sequence="486">ATHENA MEDICI 469 16.3. CATALOGUE 1. ATHENA MEDICI (Fig. 16.1) Paris, Louvre 3070. Statue. Athena 'Medici'. H. 2.605m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. Perhaps 1st century AD. The head and both arms, from the end of the drapery, are missing. The front of the toes are badly damaged. The edges of the drapery have in several places been battered and the lower edge of the aegis, including part of the gorgoneion, is broken away. The torso has been secured at the back by modern iron clamps that have been painted over, and a piece of drapery on the right shoulder at the back has been reattached. The statue is very carefully executed at the front, rather less so at the back. The statue was in the Villa Medici in Rome until Ingres, who was director from 1834-1840, brought it to Paris. It has been in the Louvre since 1913. This torso of Athena, who is identifiable from the aegis she wears, is the name-piece of the Athena Medici type. The goddess is shown standing on her left leg, with the right relaxed and set slightly to the side. She wears a thin, ankle-length chiton, of crinkly fabric, a thick peplos and a himation. The chiton is visible on the upper right arm as well as on the relaxed right leg, where it appears in the opening of the peplos. Thin folds of cloth characterize the fabric of the chiton, while modelling lines on the right leg override these folds in order to give shape to the leg. This distinctive pattern is repeated on most of the copies. The peplos is belted at the waist and has a long overfold. Its thick, vertical lines completely mask the weight-bearing leg. There is a little more movement in the upper part of the peplos, but its folds remain thick and obscuring. Characteristic folds of the peplos, which are repeated in almost all the copies of the type, include the V-shaped folds on the upper body, and the columnar folds hiding the left leg. The mantle, which is fastened on the left shoulder, partly covers the aegis on this side and then hangs down the goddess's back. The aegis is broad and rounded in shape, but not very long. Its surface is ridged but otherwise plain. In the centre at the front are the remains of a broad- faced gorgoneion. The hem line of the peplos is depicted under the right arm and along the right leg. Behind the right foot are indications of a tiny weight on the edge of the peplos. The goddess wears thick-soled sandals. The right foot is visible to the level of the instep, whereas only the toes of the left foot appear under the folds of the peplos. The remains of the upper arms indicate that they were both held down, though not close to the torso. That the head originally turned to the figure's right is shown by the remains of the hair on the neck which is positioned somewhat to the left of centre. BIBLIOGRAPHY Boardman, J. (1985a) fig. 200.

The statue suffered in a fire in around 1760, but it has been painted over to cover the damage. The head was made separately but belongs to the statue. The face has been worked over and the nose is restored. The eyes were originally inserted separately, and post-antique restorations have been left in the eye sockets. The head has been broken into three parts and is held together by clamps. It has a flat lower surface for insertion into the upper part of the statue and was originally held in place with a dowel. The face and helmet have been heavily worked over. The front of the helmet has been turned into hair. The hair at the back has also been worked over. There are a number of holes in the sides of the helmet. The arms, which were inserted, are missing from the ends of the drapery. The toes on the right foot, including the sandal straps, and the plinth have been restored. Together with Sevilla, 840, this piece came from the area of Rome, probably via Naples, as gifts from Pope Pius V (1566-1572) to Per Afan de Ribera, 1st Duke of Alcala, the Spanish vice king of Naples in 1559-1571. The Casa de Pilatos was inherited from the Duke of Alcala by the Dukes of Medina-Celi. This statue of Athena conforms in size, pose and drapery to the type of the Athena Medici. The general scheme of the folds of drapery is maintained, though the style of execution is rather different. The aegis is given a scaly pattern in relief and the waist belt has an added Herakles knot in the middle at the front. In other respects this statue is fairly close to the Medici Athena. Its chief importance lies in the fact that it retains its head, thus confirming that this head type, known in many replicas, belongs with the Medici torso. The head type is usually referred to as the 'Carpegna' head type, after the best known example. The head turns slightly to the figure's right, a movement which explains the slightly off- centre positioning on the neck of Venus rings at the front and hair at the back, the former towards the right, the latter towards the left. The face has large, heavy features with broad cheeks, and a rounded, pronounced chin. The mouth, which is relatively small, has full lips which are slightly parted. Athena wears an Attic helmet, with a strong neck-guard, bordered by a plain, raised edge. Holes in the helmet indicate the original presence of a central crest and side crests. Waves of hair can be seen at the temples in front of the ears. The hair above the forehead does not reflect the type, but is a later reworking of the helmet browband. A broad tress of hair emerges from beneath the helmet at the back. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 2. Hermann, P. (1899) 155-73, pls. II- III. Hübner, E. (1862) no. 839. Langlotz, E.

SEVILLA TORSO Sevilla, Casa de Pilatos, 840. Torso. H. 1.77m? Marble. From Italy. 2nd century AD. The statue is still fitted with old restorations: the head and helmet, the arms from below the chiton sleeves, the shield held by the left hand and resting on the ground, and a spear in the right hand. Both feet are restored. The torso has been painted over to cover the traces of 18th century fire damage. There is a small hole at the top of the left thigh. For the history of this piece, see Sevilla torso, 839. This statue of Athena conforms in pose and drapery to the Medici statue. Small variations include the rather wider belt, the front-opening aegis, with a slightly indented edge, and the Medusa head in the middle of the aegis rather than towards the lower edge, as it appears on the Medici and Sevilla 839 replicas. And yet many of the details of the drapery are faithfully reproduced, including the distinctive triangle of peplos hanging under the right arm. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 3.

The right leg is well preserved apart from a piece missing on the left inner side. It is covered by a chiton on the front, whereas the back and sides are carefully prepared for fastening to another piece of the statue. The centre of the back is roughly picked with the punch and chisel. It has a more finely worked border, like an anathyrosis. The surface for the attachment of the right foot is roughly picked. On the back of the leg there are two almost square holes. The leg was located in the Palazzo Chigi in Ariccia in 1994. It is probably from the neighbourhood of Ariccia. The leg is slightly bent and covered by a chiton which is represented by small incised folds running vertically. The pose and the drapery details conform closely to the Athena Medici type.

Perhaps 2nd century AD. The right leg is preserved from the upper thigh to the edge of the drapery above the foot. It seems to be broken off irregularly at the top. At the front, the leg is covered by a thin chiton. The back, sides and the instep are prepared for attachment to another part of the statue. The central area at the back has been roughly worked over with the punch, whereas along the sides there is a more regularly worked border. There are three square holes at the back of the piece. The knee is slightly bent and the material of the chiton which covers it is stretched on the knee cap and falls in U-shaped folds below the knee. Where the chiton falls free, the fabric is rendered in small incised grooves. Both the pose and the drapery conform to the type of the Athena Medici. Furthermore, the separately made right leg, prepared for attachment, is a feature repeated in other copies of the type, for example, the Thessaloniki fragments and the Chigi leg.

Mid 2nd century AD, but reworked in the early 3rd century AD. The nose, the left earlobe, and the surface above the lip on the left side of the head are chipped. The corners of the neck-guard and the top of the crest have broken off. Holes in the helmet indicate the places where side crests and cheek-pieces were originally added. There are also eleven smaller holes above the browband for other attachments. The head was reworked in a later period, as can be seen from the roughly picked areas on the forehead and sides where hair, rendered in stucco, was added. The face of the goddess was altered to produce a portrait of Julia Domna in the early 3rd century AD. The index finger and little finger of the left hand are missing, while the thumb and the two other fingers are damaged and lack their extremities. The right leg has minor damage at the knee. The front part of the foot, which was attached, is missing. The fragments were found in the Agora of Thessaloniki in buildings dating from the late 4th or early 5th century AD. The distinctive drapery of the right leg, its technique for insertion into a statue, its size, and the pose, hairstyle and helmet of the head all confirm that these fragments came from a statue of the Athena Medici type. Like the head from the Pnyx, the helmet, eyes and hair were all made in a piece with the head, rather than inserted as on the Carpegna head and several other replicas of the type. As in the case of the Selçuk and Vatican Museum and Magazine heads, the ears are pierced. The remains of the right lower arm and hand show</page><page sequence="490">ATHENA MEDICI 473 that the hand once held a thin, cylindrical object, perhaps a spear shaft.

Found in Torre Paterno, ancient Laurentum. 2nd century AD. The helmet, hair, draped bust, and inserted eyes are all restored. Remains of ivory and precious stones in the eye sockets reveal the original materials of the eyes. Green patina on the eyelids indicates that the lashes were made of bronze. A channel beneath the helmet shows where the original helmet was once attached. The front part of the right foot is preserved, as well as its sandal, but the big toe is missing and the other toes are damaged. There is a rectangular dowel hole in the back surface of the foot. The fragments were found by Fagan in the early 19th century in Torre Paterno, in the ruins of Laurentum. The head, which is heavily restored, conforms to the type of the 'Carpegna' head, characterized by the slight turn of the head to its right, the Venus rings on the neck, the heavy features, and the hairstyle, with waves of hair undulating from the central parting, over the temples to the ears, and a thick mass of hair descending from beneath the helmet at the nape. As in several other copies of the type, the ears are pierced. The details of the foot show careful work: thick-soled sandals, and delicately carved toes with flat nails. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amelung, W.

Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. 2nd century AD. The head is fitted with restorations attributed to Cavaceppl. These include the draped part of the bust, the hair at the back, the upper part of the helmet, the corners of the neckguard, the hair on the forehead, the tip of the nose, and the inserted eyes. There are thirteen small holes above the helmet browband. The feet are well preserved, though there is a little damage to the right foot and sandal. Their backs have been prepared with the rasp for fitting to the drapery. The fragments were found in Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. They were in the M. Wutky Collection from 1803. Although heavily restored, the type of this colossal head is recognizably that of the Carpegna head because of distinctive features such as the slight turn of the head to the figure's right, the Venus rings on the neck, and the Attic style helmet with strong neckguard. The fact that the eyes, the hair on the temples and the helmet top have been restored suggests that this copy was made following the same technique as the Carpegna head, that is, with these parts applied to the head rather than carved in one piece with it. The face lacks the strength of the Carpegna head. The attachment of the feet is another feature repeated on other replicas of the type. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amelung, W.

PNYX 'CARPEGNA' TYPE HEAD (Fig. 16.4) Athens, NM 3718. Bust. H. 0.75m. Pentelic marble. From Athens, found between the Pnyx and the Hill of the Muses. 2nd century AD. The head is in a very good state of preservation. The face is highly polished but the head is nevertheless unfinished, as can be seen from the remaining measuring points: two on the front rim of the helmet and two more at the back. The back of the helmet and the hair, both on the temples and at the back, have been left in the preliminary stages of carving. The lower part of the bust was prepared for insertion into a statue. The piece was found between the Pnyx and the Hill of the Muses in 1931. This colossal head of Athena with her helmet conforms to the type of the Carpegna head in the pose of the head, the Venus rings on the neck, the face, the hairstyle and helmet type. The technique of the head differs from that of the Carpegna head, and several of its replicas, in that the eyes, helmet and hair were not added but form an integral part of the head. The head also seems more stylized in details such as the ears and the eyes, with the indication of a large teardrop in the inner corners of the eyes and a very patterned shaping of the rim of the ears. The helmet has a single crest, a peaked browband, and a strong neckguard, offset from the body of the helmet, with a raised rim around the edge. There are also the beginnings of raised cheek-pieces. These details agree with the helmet of the Thessaloniki head. Similar browbands and neckguards can also be seen on heads where</page><page sequence="492">ATHENA MEDICI 475 most of the helmet, which was inserted, is now missing: the Carpegna head, the heads in London, Selçuk and the Terme in Rome.

The eyes, which were inserted, are also missing. Holes in the earlobes and the temples indicate where earrings and cheek-pieces were once attached. The head was acquired for the Metropolitan Museum from an American private collection. It is called the 'Hartwig' head as it was previously only known from photographs in the possession of Hartwig. These were published by Amelung in 1925. That this large head is of the Carpegna type can be seen from the style of the helmet, with pointed browband and long neckguard, and the facial features, which are large and set in a broad, oval face with a prominent, rounded chin. No hair can be seen on the temples, suggesting that it was attached, as on the Carpegna head. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amelung, W. (1925) 137-38, pls. 9-10. Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 12. Despinis, G.

Found at Ephesos. 2nd century AD. Like many heads of this type, the upper part of the helmet was originally made separately and attached, as can be seen from the large attachment channel running right the way across the top of the head. This part of the helmet is now missing. Also missing are the browband, the forehead, most of the left eye, most of the nose, a large piece of the left side of the chin, all the right part of the helmet at the back, and the eyeballs, which were inserted. Holes in the earlobes and on the temples indicate the original position of earrings and cheek-pieces. This head was found at Ephesos, between the theatre, the library and a small building to the south, perhaps a temple. That the head is of the 'Carpegna' type can be seen from the remains of the helmet, the hair on the neck, the facial features, and also the technique with attached upper helmet and cheek-pieces, and inserted eyes. In this example, the lips are particularly fleshy, and great care has been taken to model the different planes of the face to indicate the cheeks and high cheek bones. Unlike most copies of the type, this head is apparently under life-size. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 10. Despinis, G. (1975) 24, 28 no. 3, pl. 16. Libertini, G.

Marble, probably Pentelic. Found in Lepcis Magna. Hadrianic. The surface of the face is damaged, especially on the right side. The nose is completely broken off, though the nostrils can be seen. The upper lip is also missing, as are the once inserted eyeballs and the helmet crest. Part of the right side of the front of the helmet is damaged. The head is unrestored. The earlobes are pierced. This head was discovered in 1988 in the north-west part of Lepcis Magna. The colossal female head of Athena was made for insertion into a torso. Following the Carpegna head, the face is a wide oval, with full cheeks and a heavy, rounded chin. The mouth is small, though the lips are fleshy. The large hollow eyes dominate the face, with their strongly defined upper eyelids and eyebrows. The eyeballs, now missing, would have been made separately in other materials, perhaps ivory and glass, and then inserted. Little holes in the earlobes show that the goddess originally wore metal earrings. The front of the neck is marked with the characteristic Venus rings. On her head the goddess wears the Attic helmet with a low base for a crest preserved along the top, as well as a neckguard and browband. Several insertion holes along the browband as well as on the dome of the helmet show where metallic adornments, and perhaps cheek-pieces, were once attached. There are clear signs that the marble of the dome of the helmet was left roughly worked, as if it was then covered with another material to give it the semblance of metal, perhaps painted stucco. Unlike the Carpegna head, the locks of hair on the temple are carved in a piece with the head rather than attached. Other locks of hair can be seen on each side of the neck. Although fragmentary, these look as if they fell forwards on to each shoulder, more in the manner of the Parthenos hairstyle than that of the Carpegna type, which had one thick bunch of hair falling down the back.

Found on the Akropolis in Athens. Date unknown. The statuette's head, arms and lower legs are missing, as is the cloak on the back. The statuette appears to have been left unfinished. The present whereabouts of the statuette are unknown. It stood in the Propylaia on the Akropolis of Athens until 1880. Athena can be recognized in this statuette by the aegis with gorgoneion. The identification of the piece as a replica of the Medici type is assured by the relaxed pose of the right leg, which is revealed in the opening of the peplos covered only by a thin garment, and the line created by the cloak on the left shoulder.

DELOS STATUETTE OF MEDICI TYPE (Fig. 16.2) Athens, NM 1622. 'Delos' statuette. H. Im. Marble. Perhaps from Delos. 1st century BC-AD? The head, both the arms, the lower right leg, the feet and the plinth are all missing. The statuette is very weathered and the drapery is fairly chipped. The back is not finished in detail. A dowel hole indicates that the right arm was attached, whereas the head and left arm were made in one piece with the rest of the work. This statuette is reportedly from Delos. Such a provenance is put into question by the style of the piece, which is very different from anything else from Delos. It came to the National Museum in 1880 from the Theseion. This headless statuette of Athena conforms to the Medici type in the pose and apparel. There are also the remains of a bunch of hair at the back of the figure. The chiton on the right leg is carefully rendered, with crinkly folds denoting the fabric as well as overlying modelling folds above the knee as in other, larger copies of the type. The upper edge of the aegis forms a V shape on the breast. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 15. Gernand, M. (1975) 37-40, pls. 10-11. Karanastassis, P. (1987) 413-14, no.

ELIS STATUETTE OF MEDICI TYPE Athens, NM 3000. 'Elis' statuette. H. 0.73m. Pentelic marble. Found near ancient Elis. 2nd century AD. This piece is in quite good condition, though the head and neck are missing, along with the arms from just above the elbows, the big toe of the right foot, and parts of the plinth. The drapery is damaged here and there, particularly around the left knee. Traces of paint survive on the drapery and aegis. The head and right arm were made in one piece with the rest of the work, whereas the left arm was attached separately. The back is not finished, and there are the remains of two measuring points at about shoulder level. The statuette was found in the village of Kalyvia/ Amalias, close to ancient Elis in around 1880. In the National Museum at Athens since 1911. The headless statuette of Athena conforms to the Medici type in pose and attire. The remains of the bunch of hair at the back, which is set a little to the left of centre suggest that the head was turned somewhat to the right. Like Sevilla 839 and Berlin 1760, this statuette has a Herakles knot in the belt. The aegis, which has a raised and fluted edge, is left plain and there is no gorgoneion.</page><page sequence="498">ATHENA MEDICI 481 BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 13.

This unfinished piece lacks the head, both lower arms, the right lower leg and foot, the front of the left foot and much of the plinth. Part of the shield remains at the back, extending from shoulder height to the bottom of the torso. The back of the piece is left roughly shaped. It was found south of the Akropolis of Athens, opposite the theatre of Herodes Atticus. The statuette of Athena follows the scheme of the Medici type, as far as attire and pose are concerned, though the crude workmanship gives only a very rough impression of the arrangement of the drapery. The aegis is not close to the type, being bib-shaped and narrowing as it goes up to the shoulders. The folds of the mantle on the left shoulder fall much further forward than on other copies of the type, reaching well beyond the waist. A large shield is visible flattened against the left upper body at the back as if the lower left arm, which was supporting it, was held out to the side. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F.

BERLIN STATUETTE Berlin, Staatliche Museen, 1760. Statuette. H. 0.152m. Limestone. Found in Anatolia, in ancient Dorylaion. 1st century AD. The head, part of the neck, both the arms from just above the elbows, and much of the legs are missing. The statuette is broken off obliquely from high on the right thigh down across to about the knee on the left leg. The drapery is a little damaged, but otherwise the surface is quite well preserved. The statuette was supposed to have been found in Eski Shehir, ancient Dorylaion. It was acquired on the art market in 1915. This small statuette resembles the Medici type in its pose and attire but it has several very untypical features. Most unusual is the fact that the chiton is not visible on the right leg in this copy. This alteration to the type is shared by one other copy, that of the 'Ambelokipi' relief. Other untypical features include the longer aegis (again found on the 'Ambelokipi' relief), the archaic-looking twin locks hanging down in front of the shoulders, and the mantle falling over the left upper arm. Like Sevilla 839 and Athens</page><page sequence="499">482 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 3000, this statuette has a Herakles knot in the belt. The belt is placed quite high up. The gorgoneion on the aegis is winged. The folds of the peplos overfold do not fall vertically but are displaced slightly to the side, giving the impression of a more relaxed pose with greater weight disposal. A sign that the head was turned a little to the figure's right, as in true copies of the type, is the position of the bunch of hair at the back of the head which is set to the left of centre.

TERME MUSEUM STATUETTE OF MEDICI TYPE Rome, MNR, 67573. Statuette. H. 0.54m. Torso H. 0.24m. Italic marble? Provenance unknown. Possibly 2nd century AD. The torso from the neck to just below the peplos overfold is ancient. The restored head is ancient but does not belong. The right arm is missing, the left arm is broken off above the elbow. Five holes along the edge of the aegis at the front were originally used for attachments. The statuette was earlier in the Museo Kircheriano. This torso comes from a small statuette conforming to the type of the Athena Medici in its pose and attire. The type is simplified because of the small scale but essential characteristics, such as the small aegis and the chiton over the right thigh, are maintained. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amelung, W.

STATUETTE OF MEDICI TYPE IN PRIVATE COLLECTION Private collection. Statuette. H. 0.23m. Marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. The statuette is preserved from the neck to below the peplos overfold. The head, the right arm from below the shoulder, the left arm from just above the elbow, and much of the legs are missing. About half of the shield survives. The surface shows remains of the ancient treatment with wax and oil, the ganosis. There is a metal pin in the right sleeve for the attachment of the arm, and another on the right thigh, for an unknown purpose. There are holes along the edge of the aegis, for attachments, and two more above the gorgoneion, presumably for the attachment of wings. The statuette is from the collection of the Marquis de Ganay in Paris. Sold at Sotheby's Monaco in 1987. The statuette conforms to the type of the Athena Medici in the pose, the set of the head, the hairstyle and the attire. Unlike most examples of the type, the belt is not visible from the back. The aegis gorgoneion was probably winged, as in one or two other examples. The aegis scales are not depicted in relief. They may have been painted originally. The bunch of</page><page sequence="500">ATHENA MEDICI 483 hair is carefully rendered. It is gathered almost at the very bottom with a double band. Like Athens 3466 and Akropolis 2426, this figure carries a round shield on her left arm. The shield has a recessed border and a gorgoneion in the centre. BIBLIOGRAPHY Langlotz, E.

The present location of this piece is unknown and it seems unlikely that it is in the National Museum in Rome. BIBLIOGRAPHY Linfert, A. (1982) 76, no. 19. Lundgreen, B. (1997a) 27, no. 24. 26. AKROPOLIS RELIEF WITH MEDICI TYPE ATHENA (Fig. 16.5) Athens, Akropolis Museum, 2426. Votive relief fragment. H. 0.33m; W.O. 18m. Pentelic marble. Probably from the Athenian Akropolis or nearby. Late 2nd century AD. The left side of the relief is broken off. The bottom of the relief is missing too. The frame on the right side and at the top is very battered and partly broken away. The figure of Athena has lost most of the head, the right arm from above the elbow, and the lower legs and feet. The surface is rather worn. The aegis gorgoneion has almost completely disappeared. The relief comes from Athens, perhaps from the Akropolis or nearby. The votive relief has a standing figure of Athena on the right side, conforming in pose and dress to the Medici type. The neckguard and the triple crests of the Attic helmet can just be made out. The fine lines of the chiton folds are clearly visible on the right leg in the peplos opening. Like Athens 3466, the 'Ambelokipi' relief, and the statuette in a private collection, this figure carries a round shield on her left arm. It is not very large. To Athena's right is a leafy tree, probably an olive, with an owl in its branches. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chamoux, F. (1944-1945) 206-39, no. 18, pl. 23. Karanastassis, P. (1987) 415, no. B II 9, pl. 46, 4.

Thought to have been found at Ambelokipl. Date unknown. This relief has been lost for over a hundred years and its condition is unknown. It shows a frontal figure of Athena with the weight disposal of the Athena Medici, the mantle over the left shoulder, the belted peplos with a long overfold, the Attic helmet, and the front- opening aegis with gorgoneion. And yet the figure differs from the type in several important respects. Like Berlin 1760, the chiton is not visible on the right leg. In fact, in this case, the peplos does not appear to open on the right side at all. The aegis is large, reaching well down beyond the breasts. The lower arms are both held away from the body. The left arm has a round shield on it and the hand holds a spear. The right arm is held lower and there is a patera in the right hand. On Athena's right is a rearing serpent, on her left a small, frontal owl. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amelung, W. (1908) 187-88, fig. 69. Linfert, A. (1982) 77, no. 24. Lundgreen, B. (1997a) 27-28, no. 26, fig. 4.

The crest and much of the cheek-pieces of the helmet are missing. So too are some of the aegis snakes and the ends of the leaves of the calyx. The head and neck, which had broken away, have been refitted with plaster. The face is rather battered in places. The bust of Athena is placed in a calyx on top of a profiled moulding. She wears an Attic helmet with a large, offset neckguard and a peaked browband, reminiscent of the helmet of the Athena Carpegna type. A large and heavy aegis covers her torso to the waist. It is covered in large scales, rendered in relief, with a snake border, and a winged gorgoneion in the middle. BIBLIOGRAPHY Canciani, F. (1984) 1079, no. 66, pl. 789. Jucker, H.

Ivory. Found at Monte Calvo. Probably 1st century BC-AD. The face with the helmet browband survives. The top and the back of the head, which are cut off, are missing and there is a section missing on the left part of the forehead with the eyebrow. The surface is pitted and rather damaged. Much of it is missing on the nose. The once inserted eyes are missing too. The asymmetry of the face indicates that it was turned to its right. The left forearm has two large pieces missing. Its surface is rather cracked. At the top is a dowel hole for attachment. The ivories were found thirty-three miles from Rome at Monte Calvo in 1824, in the ruins of a very magnificent villa. Several sculptures in marble were found in the same location. The two fragments were sold by the owner of the estate to the Italian government and in 1836 they are recorded in an inventory of objects in the Zelada apartment, which formed the nucleus of the Museo Gregoriano Etrusco, inaugurated the following year. When they entered the Vatican Library Museum is unknown. The two fragments come from a slightly over life-size statue of Athena Medici type, as can be seen from the remains of the Attic helmet, the strong features of the oval face, and the suggestion that the head was gently turned to its right. These pieces are particularly interesting because they are made of ivory. BIBLIOGRAPHY Albizzati, C. (1916) 373-^02. Canciani, F. (1984) no. 199. Helbig, W. (1963) no. 475. Leoni, E.

HERMES LUDO VISI 17.1. THE HERMES LUDOVISI TYPE The Hermes Ludovisi type takes its name from a piece in the National Museum in Rome, which was formerly in the Ludovisi collection (Fig. 17.1). The Ludovisi statue reveals many of the characteristic features of the type. The statue represents a standing, naked young man, easily identified as the god Hermes by the petasos he wears on his head. Hermes is shown resting his weight on his left leg, while the right leg is relaxed and set to the side, with the right foot resting fully on the ground. The stance is the so-called Attic stance typical of the early Classical and Classical periods. The right knee is properly bent, so that the right foot can be brought in towards the left, giving a very stationary pose. Unlike many statues in this pose, the Hermes Ludovisi turns his head very slightly towards his relaxed leg. The position of the legs causes contraction of the muscles of the torso on the left side. On the right side the muscles are stretched, and this movement continues up into the shoulder, the position of which indicates that the arm was somewhat raised. The left arm, which is slightly bent, is held down. It bears a chlamys, the short travellers' cloak often worn by Hermes.1224 The chlamys seems to have slipped off the shoulder and now hangs over the arm and down by the left side of the statue. It merges with the tree trunk at Hermes' s side to form part of the statue support. The neck opening for the chlamys can be seen on the left upper arm. Simple zigzag folds of cloth rest on the lower arm, straight folds hang down from the wrist, while from the side one sees curving folds descending from the elbow. The hand remains uncovered, and the curled position of the fingers suggest that they once clutched a second attribute of Hermes, namely his herald's wand, the kerykeion. The head is slightly inclined forwards. The eyes of the god look down and his expression is serious. His facial features are youthfully round, but not heavy. He has a straight nose, heavy eyelids, a small mouth, and a round chin. The hair lies in a thick and distinctive mass of curls above the forehead, in front of the ears and at the back, below the petasos. In addition to the Ludovisi copy, the head type is known in a further nine copies or variants. Of these the Broadlands and Uffizi heads are fitted on modern busts while the heads in the Villa Albani and the Vatican are fitted to torsos of a different statue type. The latter is almost a variant of the type. The head in Sulmona, which maintains the Classical locks and petasos, has a face that is different enough to suggest an adaptation for a portrait. The Ludovisi body type is known in fewer copies. Despite having heads, the statues in Lepcis Magna, the Louvre, and Palazzo Colonna, and the statuette in the Capitoline provide virtually no information about the Hermes Ludovisi head type. The Palazzo Colonna statue has a head of a different type. The Louvre statue is fitted with a portrait head, probably of 1224 See, for example ANM 4485; Karouzou (1961) pl. 62. 489</page><page sequence="507">490 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Marcellus, according to Kersauson.1225 The statue in the Capitoline, while retaining the petasos and the distinctive mass of hair, has a different hair arrangement and noticeably larger facial features. In fact, the head and body of this piece are different enough for one to call this a variant rather than a direct replica of the Hermes Ludovisi type. The stance and arm positions are also different. The same is true of the very weathered statue from Lepcis Magna, which does not even retain the attributes of Hermes. There exist many other variants of both the head and body of this statue type. Although the Ludovisi statue has given its name to this statuary type, it is not a completely accurate copy of what was undoubtedly an important bronze work of Classical Greek sculpture. A more refined idea of the original statue, gleaned from a careful comparison of all the available copies, presents an image which differs in at least three ways from the Ludovisi statue. Careful observation of the hair styles reveals that, although the general design is similar to that of other heads, the Ludovisi copy does not include some of the details that can be seen on other replicas. Furthermore, there is reason to believe that the Ludovisi statue is inaccurate with regard to the position of the right arm and the position and form of the petasos. Turning to the details of the hairstyle, it is clear that a good number of copies agree about the thick mass of the hair, which frames the face, covers part of the ears and also appears at the back of the head below the petasos. Arranged in strongly marked rows, and consisting of snail-shell curls occasionally intermingled with open curls, the pattern is recognizable on the Frankfurt (Figs. 17.4-5), Albani, Ludovisi, Florence and Anzio copies, as well as on the head in the private collection and even the Sulmona head, where the face itself is so different. The Side and Broadlands copies are also quite similar, although the strongly bored holes at the centre of the curls probably reflect the influence of Antonine fashions. Yet while the Ludovisi head, for instance, remains a little sketchy in its details, the Frankfurt and Albani heads are both very precise; they agree closely about the exact layout of the hair and they include some details which are not found on all the copies. For example, they show the presence of sideburns on the cheeks, executed in low relief, as well as small locks on the neck. One of the few other copies which includes the sideburns is the Side head, a head which is very finely worked and which has a strongly metallic quality about it. With regard to the details of the hair, the Ludovisi copy is surely not one of the most informative. The problem concerning the right arm of this statue type centres around the fact that whereas the Ludovisi statue has the right arm stretched out and held forwards, other copies of the type, notably the Hermes/Marcellus in the Louvre (Fig. 17.2), show the arm sharply bent at the elbow so that the hand is brought up to the level of the right temple while at the same time being held at some distance from the face. In earlier discussions of these two possible arm positions, the Ludovisi and Louvre replicas were generally regarded as the most important examples, but there was little agreement about which presented the strongest evidence. For, while the Ludovisi copy has a restored right arm made by Algardi in the 17th century, the Louvre copy is clearly an adaptation of the type for a Roman funerary portrait statue. Furthermore, a widely held assumption was that while the 1225 Kersauson (1986) 46.</page><page sequence="508">HERMES LUDO VISI 491 outstretched arm could be interpreted as a beckoning gesture, suitable to Hermes Psychopompos, the leader of souls to the underworld, the raised arm should be interpreted as a rhetorical gesture which was, therefore, suitable to Hermes Logios, the Hermes of the Agora.1226 In the light of further research and new evidence it appears that these views have to be revised and refined. It should first be noted that, of the available statuary replicas of this body type, no other statue, apart from the restored Ludovisi statue, shows the same outstretched position for the right arm. Indeed, even Karouzou, who argued strongly in favour of Algardi's restoration, pointed out that the muscles of the right shoulder and the position of the remaining part of the top of the right arm indicate that the arm must have been held at least a little higher than Algardi thought.1227 This is borne out by other examples of the type where most of the right arm is missing. Consider, for example, the statue from Anzio and the Genoa torso. Since Karouzou's work on this subject was published, fragments of another copy of the type were discovered in Side and, as Inan convincingly shows, the Side fragments give positive evidence that the Louvre copy is accurate concerning the position of the right arm.1228 The fragments from Side, which were found in a Nymphaeum, or fountain-house, consist of a head of the Hermes Ludovisi type, part of the left leg with a support, part of the right arm and part of the left arm with a mantle draped over it. The material and proportions of these four fragments are identical, so there is every reason to believe that they belong together, especially since they do not match the fragments of the three other statues which were also recovered from this site. Enough of the right arm has survived to show that it was sharply bent at the elbow, exactly as it appears in the Louvre copy.1229 Since the Louvre statue is an adaptation of the type, serving as a portrait statue, Karouzou had suggested that the right arm movement had been altered by the copyist in accordance with the statue's new function, and that it was only because the petasos had been done away with that the arm could be positioned so high.1230 For, she argued, in the original statue the arm could not have been so placed without getting in the way of the hat. Inan 's photomontage of the Ludovisi and Louvre copies, however, proves that such a position for the right arm would not have interfered with the petasos, as Karouzou feared, even if the petasos really was placed forwards on the head, as it appears on the Ludovisi copy.1231 Thus it would seem that the Louvre and Side copies indicate the true position of the right arm. Another piece which has the right arm in almost exactly the same position as the Louvre Marcellus is the Colonna statue. The right arm of this statue was restored, probably in the 17th century, before the statue was transferred from Florence to Rome but there is little 1226 So Bulle (1922) 30ff., no. 44, fig. 17. 1227 Karouzou (1961) 95-97. 1228 Inan (1975) 32^0, catalogue no. 6.

XVIII.</page><page sequence="509">492 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS reason to believe that the restoration was influenced by the Louvre statue, even though this sculpture was known from the mid 1 7th century. Picozzi argues that the restored arm of the Colonna statue simply follows the scheme of the statue's original arm.1232 For the right shoulder is brought forward slightly, proving that the upper arm was always held forwards, and the remains of a puntello on the front of the right shoulder suggest that this was used to join the shoulder to the lower arm which must, therefore, have been raised. According to Montagu's research on the works of Alessandro Algardi, it now seems very probable that the statue Algardi imitated when restoring the right forearm of the Hermes Ludovisi was in fact a small bronze Mercury of the 16th century made by Antico, who worked for the court of the Gonzagas at Mantua.1233 This Mercury would have been well known to Algardi. In this piece the right arm is bent and held forward and the gesture is one of instruction to a Cupid learning to read at his feet. As is clear from François Perrier's drawing of Algardi 's "Hermes Logios", Algardi also thought fit to put a kerykeion in the outstretched hand and a money bag in the other (Fig. 17.3). 1234 Montagu's research provides strong reason to dismiss the validity of Algardi 's restoration. The head from the fragmentary statue is Side is in extremely good condition and it too provides valuable information about the type. In particular, the careful arrangement of the locks of hair is interesting. Such details as the way the locks curl over the ears compare closely with some of the other copies. The piece consists of the head itself and a separately attached crown-piece. The two parts fit together exactly, but their workmanship is completely different, for while the head was sculpted with minute care, the crown piece appears summarily executed. The dowel hole and the bronze pin which were used to attach the crown-piece to the head show that the crown piece is ancient. But it seems doubtful either that it formed part of the original statue or that it was an ancient repair: against the former suggestion is the fact that it is very poorly made compared with the rest, against the latter is the fact that the rest of the piece is so beautifully preserved. The remains of a band running round the sides and the back of the head indicate that the head once wore the petasos of Hermes, and, according to Inan, the crown-piece was added when the statue was altered in antiquity to stand for some personage other than Hermes.1235 Inan points out that the three other statues in the Nymphaeum represented Athena, Aphrodite and Hermes. Since the Nymphaeum dates from a period considerably later than the four statues that adorned it, it is clear that the statues were not made expressly for this building. They must, therefore, have been brought from other buildings and reused at the Nymphaeum. Inan suggests that the difficulty of finding four statues of the required proportions and subject matter was such that it is not unlikely that one of the four had to be modified to suit its new environment.1236 Thus one statue of Hermes was left as it was, while the second was 1232 Picozzi (1990) 211. 1233 So Montagu (1985) 11-12.

Another copy of the Ludovisi type which was altered in a similar manner to the Side head is the head in Florence. Once again, the band which held the petasos on the head can be observed running around the sides and the back of the head, but the petasos itself is missing and the surface has been reworked, though not completely removed in this case. The reason for the alteration, which was probably made not long after the creation of the copy, is not known, but it must also have been so that the statue could be reused to represent either a different god or a mortal. The copies of the Hermes Ludovisi type do not agree on the position or the shape of the petasos. One group of heads, which includes the Ludovisi, Broadlands, Side, Florence and Sulmona pieces, have in common the band running round the back and sides of the head and, although not all of them still have the hat itself, it is clear that they must originally have worn a petasos of a sort similar to that on the Ludovisi statue, that is a hat with a small head-piece and a wide, undulating brim. This type of hat was kept in place by an attachment band and it was generally set high on the head. On the other hand, the examples in Frankfurt (Figs. 17.4-5), Villa Albani, the Vatican, the Capitoline, the head from Anzio and the head in a private German collection, all have another sort of petasos, one which is much deeper, and which is shaped rather like a helmet. This type covers much more of the head and it also sits further back on the head. But even within these two groups there are strong differences between almost every example. For instance, the attachment band of the Ludovisi hat is narrow and rounded, while that of the Broadlands hat is flat and considerably wider in shape. And, while the Side band is fairly similar to the Ludovisi example, it is clear from the location of the fitted crown-piece that the hat was set further back on the Side head than it appears on the Ludovisi head. In the other group one notices that while some of the copies show the remains of wings, others do not. There are also obvious variations in the undulations and the depth of the hat. The fact that there is so little agreement between the copies concerning the petasos suggests that Bol may be correct when he argues that the hat was made separately on the original statue, perhaps of copper, and removed when the statue was copied.1237 Thus the shape and position of the petasos were not necessarily known to the copyists. Bol points out that since both forms of petasos are well attested from the middle of the 5th century BC, it is unwise to attribute one sort rather than the other to the original statue without further information.1238 But in his discussion of this matter, Schneider makes two points which may well tip the balance in favour of the deeper sort of petasos, as opposed to that seen on the Ludovisi statue.1239 Firstly, he notes that none of the copies of the Ludovisi style petasos gives an accurate description of this hat, with a proper understanding of the functional ensemble of the hat and hat band. Schneider highlights the odd fact that on the Broadlands head the hat brim bends down above the right ear on the right side but 1237 Bol (1989) 226. 1238 Loc. cit. 1239 Schneider (1994) 41-42.</page><page sequence="511">494 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS well in front of the left ear on the other side, while on the Ludovisi head the same discrepancy occurs, but the other way about. Schneider shows from vase paintings that this type of petasos makes sense if there is not only the hat band round the back of the head, but also another cord attached to the brim on either side of the head and hanging down loosely in front of the head and torso.1240 This cord was needed to carry the hat on the person's back when it was not being worn, and it is this which explains the dips in the sides of the hat brim. But it does not feature on the copies at all. Schneider concludes that the lack of a clear tradition concerning this style of petasos in the Hermes Ludovisi copies suggests that it is unlikely to reflect the head gear of the original statue.1241 Furthermore, he suggests that there are a number of positive reasons for believing that the other sort of petasos is more likely to be the one which belongs to this type. The deep petasos was very common in the 5th century BC, as is clear from vase paintings. It also occurs on a larger number of the replicas than does the petasos with attachment band and, most significantly, there are at least two replicas which agree almost exactly concerning the hat. These are the Frankfurt and Albani heads. The fact that both their hats are very similar with regard to the shape, the size and the position on the head perhaps suggests that they are closest to the original. 17.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The original of the Hermes Ludovisi type is usually dated in the middle of the 5th century BC. Features which point to such a date include the Attic stance, but, unusually, with the head gently turned away from the weight-bearing leg; the momentary feeling created by the cloak slipping off the shoulder; the interest shown in the contrast between the naked body and the drapery over the left arm; the assured but unemphatic modelling of the body; and the idealizing facial features, which bear comparison with those of the Tiber and Kassel Apollos, as well as with some of the heads of the Parthenon frieze. Scholars have attributed the work to a wide range of mid 5th century BC sculptors, as Palma shows, with many favouring an attribution either to Myron or to Pheidias.1242 Both Karouzou and Inan favour the idea that the type was created by Pheidias or a sculptor in his circle.1243 Following the opinion that the Apollo Kassel is by Pheidias, Inan makes a careful comparison of the Side head and the Apollo Kassel type.1244 With the help of superimposed photos of the Side and Kassel heads, Inan seeks to demonstrate the close correspondence of lines and features of these two pieces.1245 Inan finds even stronger similarities between the Side head and the replica of the Apollo Kassel in the Palazzo 1240 Schneider (1994) 46, n. 58. 1241 Schneider (1994) 42. 1242 Palma (1983) cat. no 75. 1243 Karouzou (1961) 105; Inan (1975) 32ff. 1244 Inan (1975) 38-39. 1245 Inan (1970) pl. XIX, 1.</page><page sequence="512">HERMES LUDO VISI 495 Vecchio in Florence, and suggests that the Palazzo Vecchio head and the Side head are so close that they might almost be of the same individual. The bodily pose and the proportions of this Hermes type are closely comparable with those of the Apollo Kassel. Inan suggests that the Hermes was made slightly later than the Apollo Kassel type. The Hermes appears more youthful, but the completely different treatment of the hair indicates an earlier date for the Apollo. Ridgway remains unconvinced that the Ludovisi and Kassel head types are as similar as Inan thinks, stating that " the contour of the Hermes (face) is wider and only the side locks of the Apollo blur the difference."1246 She does agree, however, that the Hermes type goes back to an original of the mid 5th century BC, which must have been a work of some prominence, since it was borrowed by Augustus to serve as the basis for a funerary portrait for some member of his family, probably Marcellus. The large number of copies of the type also point to an important original. No written evidence has been found to link the Ludovisi type with the name of Pheidias. The sources record one Hermes statue by Pheidias: the Hermes Pronaos at Thebes, mentioned by Pausanias.1247 One difficulty with this identification is that Pausanias clearly says that the statue in Thebes was made of stone, while the replicas of the Ludovisi type lead one to the conclusion that the original statue on which they are based was made of bronze. Unfortunately, Pausanias does not describe the iconography of the Theban statue. As Siebert puts it, "De l'Hermes de Phidias qui se dressait devant l'Isménion de Thèbes, theos pronaos, à côté d'une Athéna de Scopas, rien n'est connu que sa mention par Paus. 9.10.2."1248 As mentioned in section 1 , there is some dispute about the correct interpretation of the Hermes Ludovisi type. Karouzou, followed by Boardman and, more recently, by Fuchs, all prefer the outstretched right arm of Algardi's restoration.1249 This is seen as a beckoning gesture, appropriate to Hermes Psychopompos. In her discussion of Hermes Psychopompos, Karouzou put forward the idea that the original statue formed part of the official funeral monument for those who fell at the battle of Koroneia (447 BC).1250 This monument, which Pausanias mentions but unfortunately does not describe, stood on the road to the Academy and was erected at the suggestion of Perikles.1251 The epigram from the monument, which has been identified by Karouzou, is unusual in that it addresses the departed in the second person.1252 Karouzou suggested that the statue of Hermes was imagined as speaking with compassion to the deceased. The lowered head and gaze, the serious expression and the very stationary pose of the Hermes Ludovisi type would indeed 1246 Ridgway (1981) 217. 1247 Pausanias, IX. 10.2. 1248 Siebert (1990) 365. 1249 Karouzou (1961) 95ff.; Boardman (1985a) fig. 227; Fuchs (1993) 80. 1 250 Karouzou ( 1 96 1 ) 9 1 ff. 1251 Pausanias, 1.29.14. 1252 See Karouzou (1961) 103.</page><page sequence="513">496 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS suit a funerary statue of some sort. The fact that the type was used as a funerary statue in Roman times, as mentioned above, strengthens the view. Inan's convincing restoration of the original with the high-raised right arm, as seen in full in the Louvre replica and confirmed in the Side fragments, does not necessarily stand in the way of such an interpretation. For the traditional view that the raised arm is more appropriate to Hermes Logios may be a misunderstanding of the gesture. According to the Louvre statue, the right arm was bent sharply at the elbow and the hand was brought up to the level of the right temple. The hand was held at some distance from the face and, while the thumb was drawn in, the index finger was pointing upwards. When the arm is held in this position, the three- quarter view from the statue's left side reinforces the funerary air, reminding one as it does of the gesture of the hand brought up towards the face often seen on Attic grave reliefs.1253 As Grassinger points out, however, Karouzou's attribution of the type to the Koroneia monument remains hypothetical.1254 Ridgway stresses that it is not yet clear that at this date public monuments to the dead were ever decorated with sculpture and she suggests that, if it is a funerary statue, it is more likely to come from a private dedication.1255 She interprets the gesture as either one of farewell or of summoning. Picozzi agrees and is of the opinion that Hermes is here depicted either as Psychopompos or Chthonios.1256 Strocka prefers to interpret the gesture as one of silent prayer, such as would be appropriate to the Hermes Pronaos of Thebes.1257 There is disagreement amongst scholars concerning which is the best angle from which to view the statue. The full frontal view is often thought to be the most advantageous, but Inan preferred the three-quarter view from the left of the statue.1258 This view allows one to appreciate both the position of the raised right hand in relation to the head as well as the pattern of drapery of the chlamys, which contrasts well with the naked body of the god. Neither of these aspects can be seen fully from the front. Carinci who favours the three- quarter view from the left, tentatively suggests that the original statue may have been grouped with another.1259 1253 Hand raised holding a bird, Clairmont (1993), 0.710; holding a staff, 2.354; donning a hat, perhaps, 1.258; holding up a veil, 2.240. 1254 Grassinger (1994) 69. 1255 Ridgway (1981) 216-17. 1256 Ridgway (1981) 217; Picozzi (1990) 212. 1257 Strocka (2004) s. v.

HERMES LUDO VISI (Fig. 17.1) Rome, Museo Nazionale, 8624. Hermes 'Ludovisi'. Statue. H. 1.83m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. The tip of the nose, the right arm, the feet and the base are all restorations. There are traces of red paint on the cloak. The object once held in the left hand, around which the fingers curl, is now missing. The statue was restored by Alessandro Algardi. This sculptor was in Rome from 1625 onwards. Montagu has suggested that the source for Algardi's controversial restoration of the statue's right forearm was no Classical sculpture, but more probably a Renaissance bronze by Antico, which was in Mantua and which would have been well known to Algardi. The statue represents a life-size, standing and naked young man. He is easily identified as Hermes by the petasos he wears on his head. The petasos, which sits on the top of his head, has a small crown and a wide brim, which dips on either side of the face: just above the left ear on the left side, but well in front of the right ear on that side. This feature is odd and it is found again, though the other way about, on the Broadlands head. The petasos appears to be held in place by a rounded band which can be seen at the back and the sides of the head. The hair lies in thickly massed rows of curls above the forehead, in front of the ears, and at the back of the head. The curls are not all equally clearly rendered and they can be seen in more detail on the Frankfurt replica. The head lacks sideburns. The head is bent down and turned slightly to the figure's right. The eyes of the god look down. His facial features are youthfully round, but not heavy. He has a straight nose, a small mouth, and a rounded chin. Hermes is shown resting his weight on his left leg, while the right leg is relaxed and set to the side, with the right foot resting fully on the ground. This is the so-called Attic stance typical of the early Classical and Classical periods. The muscles of the torso are contracted on the left side, primarily because of the leg positions, but there is also a slight difference in the positions of the shoulders, the right shoulder appearing slightly higher. The left arm is held down, but the gentle bend of the elbow brings the lower arm forwards a little. The arm bears a cloak which seems to have slipped off the shoulder and now hangs over the arm and down over the tree-trunk support to the left of the statue. The hand remains uncovered, and the curled position of the fingers suggests that they once clutched a second attribute of Hermes, namely his herald's wand, the kerykeion. The right arm is almost wholly restored. It is held out and stretches forwards. BIBLIOGRAPHY Boardman, J. (1985a) fig. 227. Brunn, H. and Bruckmann, F. (1888-1895) 413. Giuliano, A. ed. (1992) no. 6.

HERMES OF ANZIO Rome, Museo Nazionale, 124 479. Statue. H. 1.30m. Italic marble. Found in the sea off the coast of Anzio, 1932. AD 150-200. The right arm, the left hand, the right leg from just above the knee, the left leg from just below the knee, and the nose are all missing. The wings once on the hat and the kerykeion in the left hand are mostly broken off. The statue conforms to the Hermes Ludovisi type, and it is of about the same scale as other copies of this type. With regard to stance, the position of the left arm, the inclination of the head and the hairstyle, with its complicated system of locks, this figure conforms to type. The head is covered by a petasos of the deep, helmet-like sort, similar to that seen on several copies, though not on the name-piece for this type. The remains of wings can be seen on top of the petasos. Part of the kerykeion once held in the left hand can also be seen. Precious little of the right arm survives but, to judge from the shoulder position, it would appear that the arm was raised. The facial expression is serious. BIBLIOGRAPHY Fileri, E.

Statue. H. 1.82m (Body, 1.52m; head, 0.30m). Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 1st century AD. The head is ancient but it does not belong. The right arm is restored from below the shoulder. The left hand and the apples it holds are also restored. The left arm, from the biceps, and the cloak hanging upon it, the legs from below the knees to the ankles, and the feet have been broken off and reattached. The surface is generally quite damaged. At some time a metal bar was added at the back of the statue as a support. The provenance of the piece is unknown. There is documentary evidence that it was in the Salviati collection in Florence from the end of the 17th century, and that it was then transferred to Rome to the Palazzo alia Lungara. It went to the Palazzo Colonna around 1732. The restoration of the statue was probably carried out before it went to Rome at the end of the 17th century. The position of the fingers of the right hand is very close to those of the Louvre Germanicus/Marcellus, even though there was probably no direct influence, despite the fact that the Louvre piece was well known from the mid 1 7th century. That the Colonna statue was thought of as a young Herakles is clear from the addition of apples in the left hand.</page><page sequence="516">HERMES LUDO VISI 499 The torso is of the Hermes Ludovisi type, but it is joined to a head of a different type. The head resembles certain Polykleitan heads, in particular the Kyniskos and the Narkissos. The statue is of approximately the same size as other copies of this type. Recognizable features include the stance, with the weight on the left leg and the right relaxed and set to the side, the foot fully on the ground, and the lowered left arm, mostly covered by a cloak which hangs down by his side. The original right arm must have been brought forwards and bent at the elbow, just as it appears in its restored state, for not only is the right shoulder brought forwards but in addition a round mark on the front of the right shoulder shows the remains of a puntello, which must have served to join the shoulder to the forearm. The movement is very similar to that of the Louvre Germanicus/Marcellus and the fragmentary right arm from Side. Stylistically this piece is close to the Ludovisi and Genoa copies. The system of folds on the cloak is particularly close to these examples. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. &amp; Amelung, W. (1893-1947) no. 1 127. Bol, P. C. (1989) 227 n. 8. Carinci, F. (1990) no. 1 14.

H. of head, 0.29m. Luna marble. Found at Side. AD 150-200. The head is in an excellent state of preservation. The top of the head is cut obliquely. A crown-piece, which fits exactly, was found on the site. It is broken in two halves and lacks some small fragments. The dowel hole and the bronze pin with which the piece was attached - and which has also been found - prove that the crown-piece was added in antiquity. Its workmanship is of greatly inferior quality to the head itself. The three fragments of the body are not as well preserved as the head. They show considerable damage. The fragments were found in 1959 during the excavation of the three-basin fountain house, or Nymphaeum, between the second and third basins, and two metres in front of it. They consist of a head (inv. 252: H. 0.29m); part of a left leg (inv. 263: H. 0.57m); part of a right arm (inv. 497: L. 0.6m; W.0.145m) and part of a left arm (inv. 810: L.0.447m; W. 0.195m; D. 0.16m). The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type and its size shows that it would have belonged to a statue of about the same size as the Ludovisi replica. Many individual details, such as the layout of the curls and the facial features, are close to the Ludovisi head, but there are also some interesting differences. The style of carving is sharper, giving a much more metallic feel to the piece. The long, and rather flat cheeks are quite unlike the more rounded cheeks of the Ludovisi, Frankfurt and Albani copies, and it seems probable that the cheeks of the Side head reflect the style of the copyist rather than that of the original statue. Another feature which probably stems from the copyist, and which shows the influence of Antonine fashions, is the strongly marked centres of the snail-shell curls. The same is probably true of the Broadlands head. The best copies of the head are probably the</page><page sequence="517">500 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Frankfurt and Albani heads, which share many identical features, not least the careful arrangement of the hair, with its thick mass of curls, some slightly open and many arranged in snail-shells. Like the Frankfurt and Albani heads, the Side head also depicts the small, loose curls on the neck and the sideburns on the cheeks, features which are missing from or not given in detail on most of the other copies, including the Ludovisi head. The facial features of this head all appear somewhat too large and not sufficiently rounded, when compared with the Frankfurt and Albani heads. The Side head, which was clearly altered in antiquity to stand for another figure, probably Apollo, has no petasos, though the position of the petasos on the head is indicated by the position of the crown-piece. It must have been of the same general type as the Ludovisi petasos, that is, with a small crown and a wide, dipping brim, for a band can be seen around the sides and the back of the head. But it was set somewhat further back on the head than the Ludovisi one, to judge from the size of the gap at the back of the heads between the band and the beginning of the hat in one case, and the crown-piece in the other. There is also an extra row of curls visible at the front of the Side head. The right arm fragment is very important as it clearly shows that this arm was sharply bent at the elbow, exactly as in the Louvre copy and quite unlike the Ludovisi restoration. The hand would have been brought up to the level of the temple, though it would have been held at some distance from the face. The exact significance of this gesture is still debated, but it seems likely that the Side evidence confirms that this was indeed the movement of the right arm of the original statue. There can be no doubt that the left arm fragment belongs to this same statue, for the folds of the mantle which partially cover the arm are identical with those on the mantle of the Ludovisi copy. The fragment of the left lower leg shows strong modelling of the muscles, in a manner very similar to that on the Ludovisi copy. One can also see part of the cloak, part of the support that was positioned next to the leg, and traces of a strut which once connected the two legs. BIBLIOGRAPHY Grassinger, D. (1994) 70, no. 2.

LOUVRE HERMES/MARCELLUS (so-called GERMANICUS) (Fig. 17.2) Paris, Louvre, 1207. Statue. 1.80m. Marble. Perhaps from Rome. 23 BC-AD 14. Sculptor, Kleomenes. Two toes on the right foot and the top of the head have been refitted. The thumb and index finger of the left hand have been restored. Before 1590 the statue was in the Villa Sixtus V on the Esquiline, then in the Villa Montalto-Negroni. It was bought by Louis XIV in 1684. This statue, which conforms to the Hermes Ludovisi type was adapted as a Roman portrait statue. The size of the piece, the slight downward inclination of the head, the stance of the figure, with the weight on the left leg and the right relaxed, and the position of the</page><page sequence="518">HERMES LUDO VISI 501 left arm, which is lowered and partially covered by a cloak that has apparently slipped from the shoulder, all conform to the Ludovisi type. The right arm is sharply bent at the elbow so that the hand is raised towards the head and held at about the level of the right temple. This arm movement agrees with the fragments of the statue of this type from Side but not, however, with Algardi's famous restoration of the right arm of the Hermes Ludovisi name- piece, which shows the arm outstretched. The correct position for this arm is still debated, but it seems probable that the evidence from Side confirms the authenticity of the Louvre statue in this respect. The head of the Louvre statue, with its very individualized features, its oval face, framed by hair arranged in rather flat, flame-shaped locks, is quite different from the Ludovisi type and is clearly an early Imperial portrait. Traditionally thought to be a portrait of Germanicus, this statue is now believed to represent Marcellus, who died in 23 BC, because of the close similarities with known portraits of Marcellus both in the Louvre and in the Villa Hadriana. This may be one of the first statues erected by Augustus in honour of his dead nephew. The funerary nature of the piece is clear in the lowered head and the sad expression of the face. In the Louvre statue, the cloak hangs down almost to the ground, and falls on to the back of a tortoise. The cloak plus the tortoise act as a support for the figure. The tortoise also serves to help identify the figure portrayed, for the tortoise was an emblem of Venus, who was the mother of Aeneas, the legendary ancestor of Augustus and all his family. The statue is signed by the Athenian Kleomenes. This is probably not the sculptor who signed, among other pieces, the Aphrodite Medici in Florence, but rather his son. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bieber, M.

Both arms from above the elbows, the penis, nose and right ear are all missing. Two large fragments have been refitted on the right side of the face. The head is supposed to have a large fracture on the back. The head, the right knee and left ankle have also been refitted. There are remains of puntelli on both hips. The surface is in general much corroded. The statue is a version of the Hermes Ludovisi type, only slightly smaller than the Ludovisi copy. The pose has been reversed, so that the figure stands with his weight resting on his right leg, while the left leg is relaxed and set to the side, the foot fully on the ground. But the head remains turned to the right, as in the Ludovisi statue. There is also a twist of the body to the right, but the shoulders are even. There is a tree-trunk support by the right leg.</page><page sequence="519">502 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS The figure has short, thick, curly hair, but the curls are all quite weathered and indistinct. The curls do not cover the ears. Another difference is that the head is hatless. The face has large eyes and full lips. BIBLIOGRAPHY Caputo, G. (1976) 21-22, no. 1, pl. 1-2. Siebert, G.

Much of the statue is missing, the head, the right arm, the left arm from below the elbow, the penis, the calves, the drapery to the left between the arm and the thigh, part of the plinth at the back, and various small fragments. The statue came from the Villa Cambiaso in Albaro (Genoa), but its exact provenance is unknown. The torso is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. The torso and the feet of this figure survive, and they are joined together by the drapery and tree-trunk support on the figure's left side. The head was inserted in the shallow hollow at the top of the piece. A square dowel hole and a pouring-channel for the fastening can still be seen. At the back a similar dowel hole exists on the upper left shoulder with a drill hole below it to the left, and there are two further drill holes lower down, one on each buttock.

H. 0.85m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. The nose, the right arm, the left hand, and the lower part of the legs from above the knees are all missing. The statuette was formerly in the Antiquarium on the Caelius. This sculpture is a reduced version of the Hermes Ludovisi type, showing many untypical features. Hermes stands resting on his right leg, while the left leg is relaxed and set forwards and to the side. The stance of the Ludovisi type has, therefore, been reversed, as in the Lepcis Magna statue, though the head is still bent down to the right. This is again like the Lepcis Magna statue. The arm movements too seem to have been altered. For the left arm is held along the body to the elbow, then bent outwards. Part of the kerykeion, once held in the left hand, remains. And, as far as one can tell from what is left of the right shoulder, it appears that the right arm was held down. On the right hip there are also the remains of a strut. Hermes wears a cloak draped around his upper torso, hanging down the back and over the left lower arm. He wears a petasos of the helmet type, with traces of wings on the top. But, unlike the hats of the Frankfurt and Albani heads, this one is odd in that it is not very</page><page sequence="520">HERMES LUDO VISI 503 deep and it sits on the top of the head, allowing one to see considerably more of the hair than on those two heads. Hermes also wears the fillet of an athlete. The layout of the hair, with curls radiating out from a central parting, is quite different from that of other examples of the type. The facial features are also different, being much larger and considerably more ungainly. BIBLIOGRAPHY Helbig, W. (1966) no. 1777. Siebert, G. (1990) 285-387, no. 925. 9. PRIVATE HERMES HEAD Private collection. Head. H. 0.355m. Marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. The nose and neck have been restored. The rim of the petasos and the wings, which were fastened separately, are missing. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. It is covered by a petasos of the deep, helmet-like sort, similar to those of the Frankfurt, Albani, Anzio and Vatican examples of the type, but it is unusual in that the rim of the hat rises slightly at the front, and reaches far down the head at the back. The complicated system of thick locks on the head, which is a distinctive feature of this type, and which can be seen on several examples of the type, has been adhered to quite faithfully in this replica. Some of the thick, snail-shell curls have drilled centres. In contrast to the softer modelling of the curls, the face is sharply cut. It is characterized by a heavy chin, fleshy lips and thickly lidded eyes. BIBLIOGRAPHY Antiken in Rheinischem Privatbesitz (1973) no. 354, pl. 160. Bol, P. C. (1989) 225-6 n. 7.

The head is rather battered. The front part of the hair and petasos and the end of the nose are broken away. There is also damage to the left side. The origin of this head is not known for certain. Wontergem's reference to De Nino (1903) 345 is probably irrelevant, as the head De Nino describes there, which was found just before 1903 when a wall was demolished in the Via Peligna, is hatless and considered by him to be a head of Apollo. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type, as can be seen from the three rows of curls around the forehead and temples and the petasos perched on top. The carving is very hard and unattractive. The face does not resemble other examples of this type and looks more like an adaptation for a portrait. BIBLIOGRAPHY De Nino, A. (1903) 345. Grassinger, D.

The head is fitted on to a statue of Meleager to which it does not belong. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. The hat is of the 'helmet' type, similar to that of the Frankfurt, Albani, Anzio, Capitoline and private collection heads. It has no wings. It leaves the hair uncovered all round the head and it is shaped over the ears. The curls of the hair resemble snail shells, but they are not worked out in detail. There are curls before and around the ears but none over the ears, as one sees on the Ludovisi statue and several other examples of the type. There are also no sideburns. The face has a strong chin, a small mouth, but the eyes appear large with heavy lids. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. &amp; Amelung, W. (1893-1947) 2110/111. Bol, P.C. (1989) 226-27, n. 8. Grassinger, D.

Provenance unknown. AD 55-75. The head is mounted on a statue which follows the scheme of the Diskophoros of Polykleitos and to which it does not belong. The nose, parts of the lips, the neck and the hat are all restored. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. This head is very close to the Frankfurt head, in size, in facial features, proportions, hair layout and details, including the sideburns and the locks on the neck. The helmet-like petasos is also very similar, although this one has wings added. The face appears slightly less chubby. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. &amp; Amelung, W. (1893-1947) 1 103/104. Bol, P. C.

Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 150-175. The herm on which this head has been set is modern and part of the petasos rim has been restored, but it remains broken on the right side and at the back. There is some damage to</page><page sequence="522">HERMES LUDO VISI 505 the nose and the left eyebrow. The face has been polished and the curls above the forehead redrilled. Remains of sinter at the back seem original. The herm was acquired in Rome in 1764 for £35, along with a head of Apollo, Broadlands catalogue no. 13. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. It is of approximately the same size as the Ludovisi head. The general arrangement of the locks on the head and over the ears, and the wisps of hair at the back are all quite close to the Frankfurt and Albani heads, which are generally considered closest to the prototype, but the redrilling of the holes in the snail- shell curls detracts from the authenticity of the hairstyle and is reminiscent of the Side head, which shows Antonine influence. As in the Ludovisi head, the petasos sits on the top of the head. It has a small crown and a wide brim which dips on either side of the head. The hat band that can be seen around the sides and back of the head is in about the same position as on the Ludovisi head, but it is wide and flat, as opposed to narrow and rounded. As on the Ludovisi head, the dips in the hat brim are not placed symmetrically: on the right side the dip comes above the right ear, but on the left side it occurs well in front of the ear. This is the opposite way round to these features on the Ludovisi head. BIBLIOGRAPHY Furtwängler, A. (1895/1964) 57-58, fig. 13. Grassinger, D. (1994) 14, figs. 96, 105-08. Graziu, V.

A large part of the forehead just above the brows, especially on the figure's left side, the nose and a bit of the upper lip have all been restored. There seem to be traces of ancient sinter in the hair. There are also traces of red colouring in the hair, but the whole head has been worked over. Mansuelli thinks it is made of Greek marble, but Graziu calls it Luna marble. The restorations are thought to have been made in the 16th century. The head appears for the first time in the inventories of the Uffizi in 1881. It is very probable that the head was in the Villa del Poggio Imperiale, but it is not possible to identify it with any certainty with any piece in the inventory lists of the Villa. The bust is thought to be a work by the sculptor Ignazio Spinazzi, as it shows similarities with other busts by this artist. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. The shape and construction of the head resemble those of the Ludovisi, Broadlands, Frankfurt and Albani heads. The thick mass of hair is also very similar to the Albani, Frankfurt and Ludovisi heads. But the ears are uncovered, there is no sign of sideburns on the cheeks, and the curls above the band, which goes round the back and the sides of the head, are worked much more superficially than the rest of the curls. These are all thick and many are snail-shell curls with the centres drilled. The head wears no hat, but, like the Side head, the fact that it did originally have one, is indicated by a rough area on top of the head approximately 9cm in diameter. It seems probable that the hat was removed in order to change the identity of the piece, but when</page><page sequence="523">506 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS this change was made and how the statue was reused is not known. The face has full features with a small, full mouth and slightly parted lips. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arndt, P. &amp; Amelung, W. (1893-1947) 83-84. Grassinger, D. (1994) 70 no. 3. Graziu, V. (1992) 297-307.

The tip of the nose and a large part of the rim of the petasos are missing. The head was earlier in the possession of Dr. Samuel Schweizer, Arlesheim near Basel. The head is of the Hermes Ludovisi type. It agrees very closely with the Albani head, as far as the shape and construction of the head are concerned. In these respects the two pieces are closely followed by the Ludovisi, Broadlands and Florence heads. But they are both superior to the others in the details of the hair layout. The careful pattern of snail-shell curls, with a few open curls here and there, that can be seen on the Frankfurt head, is almost exactly matched by the arrangement on the Albani head. Distinctive features of the hairstyle include the thick mass on the head, the arrangement of thick locks over the ears, the more wispy locks on the neck, and the presence of sideburns, depicted in low relief. These features are all matched on the Albani head. The Ludovisi and Florence heads convey the general thickness of the hair but some of the details of the layout are not given. Very few examples of this type of head include the sideburns. In this piece Hermes has round facial features with a straight nose, a small mouth and a round chin. The eyes have heavy upper lids and they look downwards. The head is turned slightly to its right. The rounded cheeks are particularly distinctive and they can be seen again on several other examples of the type, including the Albani and Ludovisi heads. Much of the head is covered by a helmet-like petasos, of a sort which is deeper and placed further back on the head than the small, brimmed hat of the Ludovisi, Broadlands and Sulmona heads. This petasos is almost exactly replicated on the Albani head, though that petasos has wings, and fairly similar hats can be seen on the head from Anzio, as well as those in the Vatican and the Capitoline and the head now in a private collection, which was exhibited in the Rheinische Landesmuseum in 1973.

THE OLYMPIAS/SAPPHO TYPE The so-called 'Olympias' type (Figs. 18.1-2) is known today in no less than twelve replicas, and the one which gives the type its name is in Rome.1260 This statue and its head were originally executed together as a portrait of Faustina Minor. The head was then reworked in the Constantinian period to represent a portrait of the emperor's mother, Helena. Although the head does not reflect that of a Classical original, it has been fitted to a body type that probably does go back to such an original and, to judge from the number of copies, an important masterpiece. The statue depicts a woman leaning back in a chair in a very relaxed pose. She is wearing a fine chiton and a himation that is wrapped around her legs and back, and falls over her left elbow. Her legs are stretched out before her and the right foot is crossed over her left. The right arm lies in her lap, while the left is pulled back and rests casually on the back of the chair. Her head is turned slightly to her right. The treatment of the drapery shows an effective contrast between the delicate, clinging folds of the chiton and the heavier material of the himation, which reveals the knees and lower legs in taut modelling lines and sits in a heavy bunch of loose folds gathered in the lap. All these characteristics are typical of the 'rich' style in sculpture, which is first seen on the sculptures of the Parthenon, particularly on the Parthenon frieze, and the figures from the east pediment. Many scholars agree on the Pheidian characteristics of the drapery and pose. The fine folds of the chiton may be compared to those of Artemis on the east frieze, while the pose of the statue reminds one of Aphrodite, who leans back against the legs of Artemis. The large number of replicas, some of them of high quality, suggests an important and well-known work. On the basis of the comparisons with the Parthenon sculptures a date for the original statue in the decade 440-430 BC has been proposed by a number of scholars.1261 In an attempt to associate the type with a statue base on the Athenian Akropolis dating from 450-440 BC, Delivorrias suggested that the sculpture in the round influenced the Parthenon reliefs of the east frieze and he dated the original of the Olympias type to before 438 BC.1262 Yet the drapery style and the appearance of echoes of the type in Attic vase painting of the late 430s and the 420s BC suggest a date nearer 430 BC for the type.1263 1260 Rome, Museo Capitolino, no. 496, cat. no.

Ridgway doubts that such a "stretched-out" pose for a figure seated on a chair could possibly reflect anything but a classicizing Hellenistic or early Roman work.1265 But perhaps the pose of the Olympias type has been exaggerated to some extent by the Roman copyists. The copies of the type mostly date from the first or second centuries AD. A large number were discovered in Italy, though two fragmentary statues have been found in Athens, suggesting that the type may have originated there.1266 Several copies came from important Roman villas,1267 while one was discovered in the necropolis of Pianabella in Ostia and another was used to adorn the Circus of Maxentius in Rome.1268 The head type generally associated with the Olympias body type is the so-called 'Sappho' head, which was clearly very popular for it is known in a large number of replicas (Fig. 18.3). The association was first made by Schmidt, though previously Furtwängler had suggested a Pheidian origin for the Sappho head.1269 The copies of the head show some variation in their pattern. Some are set frontally, some turn slightly to their right, and some turn to their left.1270 And while some have locks of hair descending on to the shoulders, others have ribbons. Nearly all the heads come from herms. From the posture of the Olympias figure, it seems that the most suitable of the Sappho type heads is that which turns to the figure's right.1271 Such a turn is seen in the majority of the heads of Sappho type, as well as in the Roman portrait heads which are joined to a version of the Olympias body type. In some cases the left shoulder is also clearly held higher than the right. The slight stiffness of the posture which is noticeable in this head type makes sense when it is associated with a seated figure. Stylistically, the two types seem to belong to the same era, 1264 See, for instance, the votive relief with Artemis seated on rocks, Berlin, 941, or Theano on the gravestone of Ktesilaos and Theano, Athens, NM 3472, who appears to lean against the frame of the relief. 1265 Ridgway (1981) 235ff. 1266 Athens, Akropolis, 6692, cat. no.

The head of Aphrodite on the Parthenon's east frieze has the same hair style, with a sakkos wound round the crown and the back of the head. The proportions of the face of the Sappho head type are close to those of replicas of the Athena Parthenos type as well as some of the Amazon heads from the shield. Attempts to join together casts taken from the two types have not been entirely successful, but this may be due to the differing sizes of the two replica types.1272 The variation in size of the replicas of the head and body types probably arose as a result of the use of the body type for Roman portrait statues. This would mean that each statue was worked in the size appropriate for its individual function. Take, for instance, the Aldobrandini replica which was made as a statue of Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and was set up in the Porticus Octaviae in Rome.1273 If the association of head and body types is correct, then it means that the best view of the statue as a whole is afforded when the head is seen in profile, with the body in almost three-quarter left view, an unusual angle. Pointing out the careful workmanship of the Akropolis fragment, which comes from the back of a statue, Delivorrias argued that the work was intended to be seen from all angles.1274 Ridgway nevertheless describes it as a "one-sided composition" and regards this as proof of both its debt to relief sculpture and its late date.1275 Harrison is not in favour of the association of the Olympias type body and the Sappho type head.1276 She shares Vierneisel-Schlörb's opinion that Schmidt's combination of the two types has been accepted by scholars uncritically.1277 She rightly points out that none of the heads have been found attached to a body, so there is as yet no proof that they belong together. There is some disagreement about the material of the original of the Olympias and Sappho types. One of the best replicas of the Sappho type is a herm in Naples (Fig. 18.3). 1278 From the style of its carving, many scholars would argue that the original of this herm must have been made of metal rather than marble.1279 Maderna-Lauter disagrees with this view and regards the style of the piece as a reflection of the copyist's tastes rather than as a reference to the material of the original.1280 As for the Olympias body type, Delivorrias's claim that the Akropolis fragment, no. 6692, comes from the original work led him to believe that the original was of marble. The cavity for the insertion of the head 1272 See Becatti (1969/70) 38ff. 1273 Calza (1955) fig. 9; Zanker (1983) no. 38. 1274 Cat. no. (18) A.12.

Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that the original may have been marble. All the copies which are relatively complete have a support under the chair, as is indispensable given that they are made of stone. In some of the copies, the support is a solid block of stone, with the chair legs indicated upon it in relief. In others, a cylindrical support is set beneath the chair. In four cases, as well as perhaps a fifth, though there is no record of the appearance of this piece, which is now lost, a large, reclining animal with a long and very thick tail is set beneath the chair and acts as a support.1281 In one of these compositions, Torlonia 77, the animal has been restored as a massive hound with powerful hind legs. Where the support is an animal, the tail pokes out on the figure's left side, disturbing the pleated folds of the chiton. Where the support is not an animal, the folds of the dress fall straight. In both cases, the thick mass of stone needed to represent the chiton folds acts as a support for the lower legs of the woman. This feature may point to a marble original. But what of the significance and importance of the large dog-like animal? Given the different uses to which the copies were put - funerary statue, various different portrait statues - it is not surprising to find that the main support beneath the chair was altered by the copyists to suit their needs. The animal may, however, reflect an integral part of the original composition. If so, then the possibility that the original was of stone increases. The identification of the figure as Aphrodite has been accepted by a large number of scholars.1282 The observed parallels with the goddess of the Parthenon east frieze and pediment seem to support the identification, as does the reuse of the type for Roman portraits of matrons. Aphrodite statues were very popular for this purpose.1283 If the head type is correctly identified in the Sappho type head, then this too may strengthen a link with Aphrodite for a very similar Venus type is seen on late Republican coins, as well as on gems and glass pastes.1284 But then what of the animal beneath the chair? Most scholars have assumed that it is a dog and that either it helped to strengthen the identity of the seated figure as Aphrodite, given that she was sometimes shown accompanied by a dog in eastern representations, or it served as a companion to the woman in a funerary context.1285 Neither of these explanations is wholly satisfactory, however, as Strocka has remarked.1286 Strocka can find no parallel amongst representations of dogs for the massive size of the beast and the length and thickness of its tail. In Greek representations of Aphrodite an 1281 Capitolino, 496 has a solid block under the chair; the Aldobrandini replica has a cylindrical support, cat. nos. (18) A. 1 and 5. Replicas with an animal beneath the chair are Torlonia, 77; Uffizi, 196; two lost statues from Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli and the statue in Verona (cat. nos. 2, 4, 9, 10). 1282 Schmidt (1937) 72ff.; Becatti (1951) 201ff. and (1969/70) 36ff.; Delivorrias (1984) no. 822; Maderna-Lauter (1990) nos. 215 and 242; Koch (1994) 15ff. and 183ff.; Dally (1997) 12; Gasparri (2000) 3 ff. 1283 Maderna-Lauter (1990) no. 215 n. 25. 1284 See Maderna-Lauter (1990) no. 242 n. 16. 1285 See Eckstein (1957) 723ff. 1286 Strocka (2004) s. v.

Women and, more frequently, children are sometimes shown with a dog near them, but these are almost invariably small lap dogs.1288 In some cases, the dog is shown sitting beneath the woman's chair, in others the animal is jumping up in a playful manner.1289 Strocka suspects that the antique remains of the animal in the Torlonia 77 composition reflect an aspect of the original sculpture which, he believes, included not a dog but a lion. If this is correct, then the identity of the Olympias type as Aphrodite may well be called into question. 18.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The identity of the seated figure remains much disputed. The uncertainty about the head type and the original form taken by the support beneath the chair means that the state of the evidence is incomplete and any clues that these features of the composition might have provided are sorely wanting. The noteworthy discovery made on the Akropolis at Athens of a finely worked marble fragment of this statue type led Delivorrias to the conclusion that the fragment was part of an original Classical Greek statue which he dated around 450-440 BC.1290 He identified it as the statue made by Kalamis for Kallias's dedication in the hypaethral sanctuary of Aphrodite on the northern slope of the Akropolis.1291 He believes that the statue was moved in the Roman period to the Propylaia, where a fragment of the base, bearing part of 1287 Dogs generally accompany gods or heroes either as guard dogs or hunting dogs. They are principally the companions of the hunters Apollo and Artemis, as well as various hunting heroes such as Akteon, Kallisto and the participants in the Kalydonian boar hunt. See Mainoldi (1984) 59. In scenes depicting the judgement of Paris, Paris is sometimes characterized as a shepherd by the presence of a sheep dog. A depiction which includes a particularly massive dog with a great, strong tail, is on the Karlsruhe hydria, B 36 (259). In Greek art, the more usual animal companions of Aphrodite are swans, geese or doves. See LIMC Aphrodite, 96-98. She is also represented riding on a goat or a dolphin or, as in the case of the Aphrodite Ourania, standing on a tortoise. 1288 In Greek funerary monuments a distinction is made between dogs which are engaged in a scene, playing with their master or mistress or accompanying them, and dogs which are represented alone, in the round or crowning a relief. The latter representations have a more funerary connotation, while the former are used more as a symbol of fidelity and they show scenes in the life of the deceased. See Mainoldi (1984) 38. 1289 See, for example, ANM 882, showing a seated woman with a small pet dog standing in front of her (Clairmont (1993) cat no. 1.190); Angers, Mus. Pincé, 268-19, showing a seated woman with a small dog beneath her chair (Clairmont (1993) cat no. 2.350); and Athens, 3rd Ephoria M 184, showing a standing woman with a little dog playfully jumping up (Clairmont (1993) cat no. 1.332). 1290 Delivorrias (1978) Iff., pls. 6, 1; 8, 1; 10. 1291 Delivorrias (1978) 17. The sanctuary is mentioned by Pausanias, 1.23.2.</page><page sequence="531">5 1 4 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDI AS an inscription mentioning the names of Kallias and Kalamis, has been found.1292 The careful workmanship of the piece, which is a fragment of a shoulder, would prove that the statue was intended to be seen from all angles rather than merely from the front and sides as would have been the case for a statue set within the naos of a temple. The difficulty with this theory is that nothing is known about the iconography of the statue by Kalamis. Pausanias, 1.23.2, gives no description of the work and the statue base is too fragmentary to confirm that it bore a seated figure. The workmanship of the piece is certainly very good, but this does not automatically mean that it is from the original work. Considering the method of attachment of the head, it is more likely to be of Roman date, the excellent quality of the workmanship being attributable not to its date but to the fact that it was made by an Athenian sculptor.1293 Vierneisel-Schlörb's major objection to Delivorrias's theory is his date in the 440s BC for the original of the Olympias/Sappho statue, which she regards as too early.1294 The fragment is not very large and, according to Vierneisel- Schlörb, it seems almost smaller than the Verona fragment with which Delivorrias compares it.1295 Little is known about exactly where the piece was found. The fragment was entered in the inventory only in 1978, according to Delivorrias, and it was just one of a number of fragments gathered from all over the Akropolis. Dally questions the plausibility of Delivorrias's hypothesis that the statue was moved from its sanctuary to the Propylaia and then removed from its statue base.1296 He also doubts the suitability of the Olympias type for the sanctuary of Aphrodite on the northern slope of the Akropolis, both on the grounds of the size of the type as well as on the grounds of its iconography. For the sanctuary was very small and, given the links between this sanctuary and the sanctuaries of Aphrodite in Daphni and on the banks of the Ilissos, Dally thinks it more likely that all three sanctuaries would have shared a similar type of cult statue. In his opinion, this would have been the leaning Aphrodite type, known in numerous copies and variants.1297 The type is linked with Daphni through a representation of the goddess on an early 4th century 1292 Raubitschek (1949) 152-53, no. 136; Raubitschek, however, wants to locate the original statue in an Aphrodite sanctuary on the west slope of the Akropolis. 1293 Harrison (1984) 379 n. 3.

Maderna-Lauter (1990) 207, no. 215, also doubts that the Akropolis fragment is an original 5th century sculpture. 1294 vierneisel-Schlörb (1979) 109-10 and 114. She is inclined to support the suggestion made by Delivorrias concerning the identity of the 4 Olympias V Sappho' type with Kalamis' s statue of Aphrodite on the Akropolis. But she still sees some value in Dörig's identification of the Cherchel Demeter as a statue made by Kalamis. 1295 Vierneisel-Schlörb (1979) 1 14.

He simply suggests that it came from a different Athenian sanctuary of Aphrodite, in which the goddess was worshipped under a different aspect.1301 The Pheidian characteristics observable in the pose and drapery of the seated Olympias type, as well as in the proportions, hairstyle and features of the Sappho head type, which many scholars recognize, have led to a search amongst the recorded works of Pheidias for the true identity of these body and head types, whether or not they are thought to belong together. As noted above, Schmidt was the first to associate the two types and he followed Furtwängler in identifying the reconstructed work as a masterpiece by Pheidias which was taken to Rome.1302 Pliny, NH 36.15, says that it is reported that Pheidias worked in marble and that one of his works, a statue of Venus, was in the Porticus Octaviae in Rome and was of outstanding beauty. The identification of the Olympias/Sappho type with the marble Venus has been supported by a number of scholars.1303 The fact that the type may reflect a marble original stands in favour of the identification. The large number of Roman copies of the type prove that the type was known and appreciated in Italy. And the questionable status of the Akropolis fragment, no. 6692, cannot be used to prove that the identification is mistaken, as it would if the fragment were part of the original statue. Nevertheless, positive evidence in support of the identification remains weak. Pliny gives no description of the iconography of the work in Rome and, from the way in which he mentions it, "tradunt", it seems doubtful that he himself actually saw it. Furthermore, doubt has been cast on the assumption that the Olympias/Sappho type represents Aphrodite. Strocka has suggested that the animal beneath the chair was not a dog at all but a lion and, as such, an appropriate companion for the goddess Meter, the Mother of the gods.1304 He thinks that the fact that the lion was not always included in the composition by the copyists could be explained by the function of the individual copies, for the lion would only have been needed in cases where the goddess herself was being represented or where the portrait was being given a 1298 Dally (1997) 9ff.

A reason to believe that this identification may be correct is, as Strocka points out, the fact that the original setting of one of the replicas of the type, Torlonia 77, was the Circus of Maxentius in Rome: the arrangement would have matched that of the Circus Maximus in Rome which was adorned with a famous statue of Kybele. Two sources state that Pheidias made the statue of the Mother of the gods in Athens, Pausanias, 1.3.5, and Arrian, Peripl. 9.1. Arrian preserves some information about the iconography of the statue because he compares a statue in Phasis with the Mother of the gods statue in Athens and says that it is like the Athenian statue in that it represents a seated figure of a goddess with lions under her throne and a cymbal in her hands. Naumann is of the opinion that the goddess would have been depicted in Classical manner, wearing a chiton and himation and holding a cymbal in her raised left hand.1305 These are all good reasons, according to Strocka, along with the presence in some of the copies of the large animal beneath the chair, for identifying the seated Olympias type with the famous Athenian statue of the Mother of the gods. From Pliny, NH 36.17, one learns that the Mother of the gods statue was made of marble. Pliny does not describe the work and he attributes it to Agorakritos, Pheidias's pupil. He also says that Pheidias allowed Agorakritos to attach his name to several of Pheidias's own works. The observed similarities of the Olympias type with the Parthenon sculptures suggest that its original may well reflect a work by Pheidias or his school. The proposed date for the type, towards the end of the 430s BC, makes it probable that if Agorakritos did not design the work, he may have had a hand in its execution. Strocka brushes aside the problem of the absence of a cymbal in any of the copies, suggesting that, in most cases, it would have been irrelevant given that the copies were made as portraits of Roman matrons. In the few cases where the goddess was represented, Strocka thinks that the cymbal may have been added in metal. Strocka is in favour of maintaining the old association of the Sappho head type with the Olympias body type. Instead of the Olympias/Sappho type, Strocka proposes the so-called 'Kore Albani' type as a reflection of the marble Aphrodite by Pheidias which was taken to Rome.1306 This was clearly another famous and important work, for there are at least four copies of the statue and two of the head, as well as several variants both in the round and in relief dating from the later 5th century BC and the 4th century BC. The type was clearly used in antiquity to represent both Aphrodite and Persephone, and the identity of the original of the type remains disputed.1307 According to Strocka, evidence in favour of the identification of the type as Aphrodite rather than Kore may be provided by the discovery of a variant of the type in Baiae which is a portrait of Antonia Minor bearing a little figure of Eros on her left arm.1308 The close similarity between the Kore Albani type and the Nemesis at Rhamnous 1305 Naumann (1983) 159ff. 1306 Strocka (2004) 5. v.

He points to the curious story recorded by Pliny, NH 36.17, of a contest between two of Pheidias's pupils, Alkamenes of Athens and Agorakritos of Paros, to produce a statue of Venus. According to Pliny, when Alkamenes was voted the winner by his fellow citizens, Agorakritos sold his statue and it was set up in Rhamnous as a representation of Nemesis. Strocka suggests that Agorakritos based his statue of Nemesis on an earlier work by his master, Pheidias. This would account for the obvious similarities between the two works as well as for the altered position of the arms and the later style of the drapery. Strocka compares the pose of the Kore Albani type with that of the Apollo Kassel and the drapery style with the Hermes Ludovisi and the Athena Medici. He finds a parallel for Aphrodite with both shoulders covered in Parthenon north metope 25. For these reasons, he dates the Kore Albani type to around 450 BC. Many scholars would agree about the similarities between the Kore Albani type and the Parthenon metopes, and several have attributed the original of the type to Pheidias.1309 But the type is generally dated around 440 BC or even later.1310 If the later date is correct, then the covered shoulders would be more appropriate for Persephone than Aphrodite. 18.3. CATALOGUE (A) OLYMPIAS TYPE 1. CAPITOLINE STATUE Rome, Museo Capitolino, 496. Statue. H. 1.23m; L. 1.47m; W. 0.53m. Greek marble. Provenance unknown. AD 150-180. The tip of the nose, parts of the neck, three fingers of the right hand and all those of the left hand, part of the toe on the left foot, and the rear left corner of the plinth, including the leg of the chair, have all been restored. The inserted piece, with the head, neck and bust, is of the same marble as the statue. The hair has not been worked on the back. This Antonine sculpture originally represented Faustina Minor. Like Uffizi 171, the head was reworked in the Constantinian period to represent Helena, the mother of Constantine. It is first recorded in the Vatican. It was granted to the Capitoline Museum by Pope Pius V in 1566. The statue, representing a seated woman, is of the so-called 'Olympias' type, but used for an official portrait. In a particularly relaxed manner, the woman leans back in her chair with her legs stretched out before her, the right foot crossed over the left. The woman's left foot rests on the ground. The chair has curvilinear legs and a high back. The back consists of a wide T-bar with thinner uprights coming up from the back legs of the chair. The horizontal bar of the back curves forward and the woman rests her left forearm upon it. Her left arm is drawn back and folded, while her right arm rests on her right thigh. As a result of this position, the left shoulder is slightly raised and the torso twisted gently round to the 1309 Furtwängler (1893) 100; Schräder (1924) 50ff.; Langlotz (1947) 90; Lippold (1950) 154; Richter (1970) 176ff.; Despinis (1971) 203; Fuchs (1972) Heibig, IV, no. 3342; Bieber (1977) 121. 1310 Baumer (1997) 19 and n. 81.

She wears a long chiton with buttoned sleeves, girdled above the waist, and thin-soled, leather sandals on her feet, with a back strap and straps passing between the first two toes. She also has a heavy mantle draped over her. The mantle covers much of her legs and the overfold is bunched over her lap. On the right hip it is brought up around her back towards the left shoulder and caught around the left elbow. On each side, where the legs pull the mantle forwards from the chair seat, there are strong tension lines in the cloth, which gradually change into modelling lines over the legs. Masses of thin, crinkly chiton folds, contrasting sharply with the heavier fabric of the mantle, emerge from beneath the mantle and cover the ankles. On the main part of the body, however, the chiton articulates the forms beneath, its fine fabric modelling the widely spaced breasts and the stomach. The contrasting patterns of the folds of mantle and chiton, the use of transparent drapery and modelling lines to reveal the female form, coupled with the pose itself, all confirm the indebtedness of this statue type to the sculptures of the Parthenon, in particular to the seated goddesses of the east frieze. Many of the features of this statue are repeated in other copies of the type, suggesting that they reflect the prototype. This work, however, also shows characteristics of its own. The head, which is a portrait of Helena, mother of Constantine, is very slightly raised and turned to its right. The chair seat is covered in a thick, squashy cushion with a piped edge. The chair legs are rendered in relief on a solid block of stone which supports the seated figure above. The statue is worked in detail on three sides, but left roughly executed at the back, suggesting that the work was intended to be set against a wall. The feet rest on a low, rectangular slab. The bundle of mantle folds on the woman's lap is thick and voluminous. On the left side of the figure one sees the decorative details of the Parthenonian-style selvage edge, and three of the weighted corners of the cloth hanging down. The style of carving is hard. The folds on the mantle over the legs are quite shallow. The copies of the type do not agree about the form of the support, if any, beneath the chair. In this case, where the chair is rendered in relief on a solid block, the hem of the chiton on the left side is undisturbed and falls straight down. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P. (1993) 185-200.

TORLONIA STATUE 77 (Fig. 18.1) Rome, Torlonia Museum, 77. Statue. H. 1.40m; L. 1.25m; W. 0.48m Marble. From Rome, Circus of Maxentius. 1 st century AD. The statue was found without the head, right shoulder or left arm. Its surface is very weathered. It was discovered at the eastern end of the Circus of Maxentius, Rome, in 1825. The piece was restored by O. von Launitz, pupil of B. Thorvaldsen. The statue of a seated woman conforms in pose and drapery with the Capitoline statue. A major difference in this case, however, is that the chair is executed in the round and that, beneath the chair seat, and acting as a support, is a large animal, the head restored as that of</page><page sequence="536">OL YMPI AS/S APPHO 5 1 9 a dog. He lies on the ground with his head facing out to the woman's left side from beneath the chair. His long, thick tail can be seen along the ground disturbing the hem of the chiton on the left side. The Verona statue and Uffizi 196 also had an animal support, as did the now lost statue from the Villa d'Este and, perhaps, its pendant. The woman's feet are bare and the left foot rests directly on the ground. The seat of the chair has no cushion, but in other respects the chair is similar to that of the Capitoline statue: it has curvilinear legs and a wide T-bar at the back curving inwards on either side. The horizontal part of the T-bar, however, is considerably longer in this case so that the ends stick out in a manner which mars the front view of the figure. The best view of the composition is undoubtedly from the left side, which reveals both the arms of the woman, the three-quarter view of the torso, the more interesting side of the drapery, with the end of the mantle overfold, the animal's head and, originally, the woman's head, more or less in profile. From the right side one sees the hands and both the feet, but one loses the left arm, and much of the torso and the animal. The style of the drapery, particularly the flat folds of the mantle over the lower legs, is reminiscent of the Capitoline statue. This replica is bigger than the other known replicas of the type. It is very damaged and it has been badly restored, yet it is perhaps one of the more charming of the surviving copies. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P. (1993) 198 and n. 49. Becatti, G.

H. lm. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. AD 150-180. The nose, the hair below the ears, the left hand, three fingers on the right hand, part of the back legs and seat of the chair are restored. The head has been reworked. This Antonine sculpture originally represented Faustina Minor. Like the Capitoline statue, the head was reworked in the Constantinian period to represent Helena, the mother of Constantine. A statue of a seated woman of the so-called 'Olympias' type, it has been used for an official portrait. The drapery of the figure conforms to the type, but the pose is much more upright and stiff. The legs do not stretch out as far as those of other replicas, and the folded left arm is set much more vertically. The altered pose means that there is much less movement at shoulder level. The chair is rendered in relief on a solid block, as in the Capitoline statue, and there is again a cushion on the seat but it is thinner and its edge is less well defined. As in the case of the Capitoline statue, the detail of the selvage edge of the mantle is depicted and three of the corner weights are shown too. The drapery folds are</page><page sequence="537">520 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS very heavy, and the sculptor has not made a great distinction between the mantle thickness and that of the chiton. This is particularly clear on the breast and stomach of the woman, where there is little transparency. The sculptor has concentrated on the decorative aspect of the folds at the expense of realism, making the work seem fussy. There is no footstool beneath the feet, and the hemline of the chiton is undisturbed. The woman wears simple, strap sandals but her right foot is arched, and is not relaxed. The head of the figure turns towards her left. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P. (1993) 198 and n. 53. Becatti, G. (1969-1970) 36-37 no. 2. Mansuelli, G. A. (1961) Vol. 2, 131, no. 171, fig. 168a-c. 4. UFFIZI STATUE 196 Florence, Uffizi Galleries, 1914 n. 196. Statue. H. 1.16m; L. 1.12m; W. 0.52m Greek marble. Provenance unknown. AD 150-180. The head with the neck, the fingers on the left hand, the thumb, index finger and middle finger on the right hand, the lower part of the plinth including the feet, the lower part of the seat and a large part of the back of the chair have all been restored. Mentioned in the museum inventories for the first time in 1774, the statue is said to have come from Rome. Arata suspects that it is one of the two replicas reported to have been in the Odeum at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. A statue of a seated woman of the so-called 'Olympias' type, it has been used for an official Roman portrait. Unlike Uffizi 171, this statue tends to exaggerate the characteristics of the type. The woman sits in a very relaxed manner, as in the Capitoline example, but she leans back so far that the seat of the chair has had to be made considerably deeper than on other examples of the type. Her left foot is set on a small, raised plinth. A clear distinction has been made here between the folds of the mantle and the chiton to make the mantle appear thicker: the woman's form is fully modelled through the drapery of the chiton on the breast and the stomach, while the mantle is characterized by much deeper folds very irregularly arranged in a naturalistic manner. In this respect, the sculpture is more akin to the Verona and Aldobrandini statues than, for instance, the Capitoline and Albani statues. The stomach is further emphasized by the fact that the chiton overfold is rather shorter than on other copies of the type. The disturbance of the hem of the chiton on the left side shows where an animal once lay beneath the woman's chair, its tail poking out on her left side. The animal, however, does not survive in this case. Two other replicas with animals beneath the chair are the Verona statue and Torlonia 77. The restored head of the figure is turned to her left. The sandals are unusual in that they have crossing thongs threaded into the raised sandal edge. In this case the chair seat has no cushion. The remaining front legs of the chair are curvilinear and the chair was originally fully modelled. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P.

ALDOBRANDINI STATUE Frascati, Villa Aldobrandini. Statue. H. Im; W. 0.40m. Marble. From Ostia, the Pianabella necropolis. 2nd century AD. The head, along with the neck and bust, which were inserted, are missing, as are the plinth, the lower part of the cylindrical support beneath the seat, much of the chair back and the legs of the chair. The right shoulder is broken off, along with much of the upper arm. The lower arm, which seems to have been inserted, is completely gone. The left shoulder is preserved but the left arm is lost. This sculpture was used as a funerary statue in the necropolis at Pianabella near Ostia. It is a statue of a seated woman of the so-called 'Olympias' type. Like the Capitoline and Uffìzi 196 statues, this figure sits in a relaxed pose with her legs stretched out and crossed before her. The treatment of the drapery folds is very elegant. The tension lines on the mantle from the chair seat out to the lower legs are more numerous than on the Capitoline statue, and closer to those of Uffizi 196. The folds over the front of the lower legs are deep and varied, again closer in style to Uffizi 196 and the Verona statues. The hemline of the chiton on the left side is undisturbed; there was no animal under the seat of the chair, which was instead supported by a cylindrical support. The open sandals have thin straps. The seat of the chair appears padded and rounded on the edges. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P. (1993) 198 and n. 54. Becatti, G. (1951) 201, fig. 298. Becatti, G. (1969-1970) 37 no. 7. Calza, R.

Under the seat is a roughly worked cylindrical support. A statue of a seated woman of the so-called 'Olympias' type, recognizable from the pose, drapery and chair. The seat of the chair is supported by a cylindrical block and, as expected, the hemline of the chiton is undisturbed. The chiton issues from beneath the mantle in regular, fanlike folds which are very decorative.

In this case, the left foot is set upon a rectangular footrest, there is no dog beneath the chair and the hem of the chiton on the left side is consequently undisturbed. Quite uncharacteristic is the lack of overfold on the chiton, so that the high girdle, which is narrow and tied at the front, is visible.

Restorations include both the arms with the shoulders, apart from some of the left upper arm which is ancient, parts of the drapery below the right arm and on the front of the right shin, the feet and the plinth below, the plinth at the back and below the chair, the four chair legs, the edges of the seat and the ends of the chair back. The head is ancient but it does not belong. The history of this object from the Albani Collection is unknown. It is mentioned by Winckelmann in 1767. A statue of a seated woman of the so-called 'Olympias' type, conforming to the type in its drapery and pose. Beneath the chair seat, and acting as a support, is a block of stone adorned on three sides with draped female figures in relief, each one imitating a famous statuary type. On the statue's left side is a seated 'Ourania' type, at the back a 'Smaller</page><page sequence="540">OLYMPIAS/SAPPHO 523 Herculaneum woman', and on the right side a 'Kore Albani'. Maderna-Lauter suggests that the statue was a funerary monument and that the dead woman's portrait was used not only for the head of the statue, but also for those of the three figures in relief beneath the chair. In this case, the support is fully contained within the legs of the chair with the result that the hem of the chiton is undisturbed and falls straight down. The chiton is depicted with thin, hard folds arranged in close, wavy lines and little use of transparency, and it contrasts strongly with the smoother areas broken by rather flat, broadly forked folds on the mantle covering the legs. Despite a general resemblance in form, the style of drapery carving appears far removed from any 5th century prototype and betrays the Antonine date of the work.

There were supposed to have been two statues of the same type, probably pendants, in the Odeum of Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. One of them, with an animal under the chair seat, was drawn by de Cavalieri in the 16th century, when it was in Rome, in the garden of the Villa d'Este, on the Quirinal. Part of the collection of Cardinal Ippolito d'Esté went to Cardinal Ferdinando de'Medici, whose collection was later incorporated into the Uffizi collection in Florence. But, according to Calza, the statue in the drawing was inherited by the Duke of Modena and it went missing in a shipwreck in 1774 when it was being transported to Ischia. This statue, which is now lost, is known only from a drawing by de Cavalieri. The woman is shown sitting in the characteristic pose and drapery of the 'Olympias' type, and there is a large animal beneath her chair. But its tail is not visible and the hem of the chiton on the left side remains undisturbed, unlike other copies with the animal. The chair is depicted in a series of straight, stocky bars which again deviate from the type. The chiton has a low, rounded neckline, which is apparently edged. The head is turned towards the left side. The diadem on the head and the apparently incised pupils of the eyes suggest that the head was another imperial portrait. The woman has thin-soled sandals on her feet, like several other copies, and the left foot rests on the ground. But the right foot is unusually turned so that the sole of the sandal is visible from the left side. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arata, F. P. (1993) 198 and n. 50. Becatti, G. (1969-1970) 37 no. 10. Calza, R.

The head, neck, and shoulders of the woman are missing, along with her left arm, most of the fingers of the right hand, the left knee and the feet. The upper torso and the breast are very damaged. Part of the hind quarters of the dog remains. The chair is also very damaged, and it is lacking its legs, the ends of the T-bar at the back and the uprights. The statue was found with many fragments of architecture from a late period. The fragmentary statue of a seated woman is of the so-called 'Olympias' type. Like Uffizi 196 and Torlonia 77, this statue was originally supported under the chair by a large, reclining animal whose tail poked out between the front legs of the chair and disturbed the hem of the chiton on the figure's left side. The style of drapery carving, with a clear distinction made between the thin, sometimes transparent, fabric of the chiton, and the heavy, deeply cut folds of the mantle, is similar to that of Uffizi 196 and the Aldobrandini statue. This copy cannot be restored with the head turned to its right, according to Vierneisel-Schlörb. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1969-1970) 37 no. 6. Calza, R. (1955) 113, fig. 10. Delivorrias, A.

Traces of a square socket remain for the insertion of the head. The folds of drapery are quite well preserved at the back, but much of the surface is broken away at the front. The piece was discovered in the Akropolis Museum Magazine. It is thought to come from the Akropolis. The fragment preserves a right shoulder wearing a sleeved chiton. The arm is lowered and held close to the torso. On the front a groove follows the line of the shoulder and the arm, and the chiton folds open out on either side of this line. At the back, close, thin folds fall vertically on the right side and then gradually tend towards the left diagonal. The folds are partially hidden by the central part of the T-bar of the chair back. The layout of the folds and the chair back is very close to that of the Verona statue, with which Delivorrias compares it in his study of the Olympias type. BIBLIOGRAPHY Delivorrias, A.

BRITISH MUSEUM STATUETTE London, British Museum, 1856.5-12.6. Statuette. H. 0.34m. Bronze. Said to be from the sea off Pozzuoli or from Chiusi. 400-350 BC. Two of the feet of the stand are modern, the face has been mechanically cleaned, and heavy corrosion has caused damage in some areas. This female figure forms a support for a candelabrum. The candelabrum is made to represent a stem with leaves growing closely round it coming from a calyx on a base surrounded by knobs, which rests on the head of the figure. The figure of the woman rests on a circular base with an incised egg pattern around it. The pose and drapery of the woman are reminiscent of the Olympias type. She looks down to her right. She holds a diadem in her right hand. The right arm rests on the back of the chair. Her hair is bound in a narrow fillet and gathered at the back. She has a circlet in her hair and a necklace with pendants. Her feet rest on a footstool. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bailey, D. M. (1996) no. Q 3866. Delivorrias, A. (1984) 2-151, no. 823. Walters, H. B.

This piece is well preserved, except for the back of the head with the bun, which is missing. The head is cut off obliquely at the back. The herm represents a woman with the head turned gently to her right. The type has been recognized in numerous copies, primarily because of the distinctive arrangement of the hair, which is thick and curly, and elaborately arranged in long, broad bands of ribbon. The ribbon is bound tightly around the head at three levels; firstly, just above the forehead, then over the crown and then again at the back of the head. The bands are wide over the forehead and the top of the head, but beneath the bun the ribbon is fully opened out, forming a sort of bag to hold the hair. One end of the ribbon is brought forward from beneath the middle band on the head and secured under the band over the forehead, with its folded end sticking out in a distinctive manner above the middle of the forehead. As the band comes forward towards the front it veers slightly to the right, the direction in which the head turns. These features recur in a number of replicas of the type. Thick waves of hair are brushed to the side between the front and middle bands. On the temples are even thicker curls, which rise up on to the front band and cover the forepart of the ears. In front of the ears and beneath the temple curls are some very small flame-shaped waves of hair rendered in low relief, three on the left cheek and two on the right. This is another detail which is faithfully repeated on a number of replicas. At the back of the head is a voluminous mass of hair arranged in a bun and partially bound in the cloth of the ribbon. Issuing from the bun are several long, thick locks of hair, which twist downwards, two of them falling forward on to each shoulder. Most copies of the type do not include the shoulder locks and in some, for example, the Munich replica, they are replaced by ribbon ends. The face, which is rather hard in its treatment, describes a broad, oval shape. Sharply defined, straight eyebrows sit above heavily lidded, almond-shaped eyes which appear half shut. The mouth is full-lipped and slightly open, revealing the teeth. The replicas of this type do not agree about the face and, while some of them show a mature face, as here, others show a much more youthful and softer person. There is also disagreement amongst the copies about which way the head turned, with many turning to the right, like the Naples herm, and a good number turning to the left. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G.

Around AD 150. Earlier restorations have been removed. The piece has lost the end of the nose, the back half of the head, the proper left front of the herm. Some of the details of the hair are slightly worn. There are a few chips to the surface. The sculpture was found in Italy. It was acquired in England in 1902. The herm is of the so-called 'Sappho' type, best known in the Naples herm. Typical features include the arrangement of the hair and hairbands, including the folded ribbon end on the forehead, and the low relief flame-shaped locks in front of the ears, two on the right side and three on the left side, just as they appear on the Naples, British Museum, Florence, and Corneto pieces, for example. Like a number of other replicas of this type, but unlike the Naples herm, this head turns to its left and the face is correspondingly asymmetrical (the left eye, for instance, is longer than the right). The shoulder locks of the Naples herm are missing, and have been replaced by long, broad ribbon ends. Furthermore, the eyes are different, for they are fully open. As in the case of the Madrid and Villa Albani heads, the face is a little wider than that of the Naples herm, though it maintains the compact volumes and the mature features of that example.

MADRID HERM Madrid, El Prado Museum, E-26. Double herm. H. 0.48m. Marble. Provenance unknown. Roman work. The tip of the nose is restored. The surface of the marble is rather worn. This sculpture is a double herm with Eros on one side and a female head of the 'Sappho' type on the other. The type is recognizable from the inclusion of the two front hair bands, the top band coming forward with its tip folded over and poking out from beneath the forehead band, and the wavy hair on the head, with thick curls on the temples and low relief locks before the ears. The hairstyle, however, differs from that of other replicas in that the curls on the temples are differently arranged, the waves on the head are very thick and serpentine, and there are two archaic-looking, wavy locks, ending in tight curls, falling from behind the ears on to the front of the shoulders and breast. Another peculiarity of this depiction is that the head looks straight ahead, and the band of ribbon coming forwards is also set straight. The face is mature and broad, and the eyes are heavily lidded. Unlike the Naples herm, the eyes are large and wide open, and the chin is heavy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Barrón, E. (1908) no. 26. Becatti, G.

VILLA ALBANI HEAD Rome, Villa Albani, 109. Head. H. 0.37m. Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 1 17-138. Much of the herm has been restored. The tip of the nose, some locks of hair by the left ear, the eyeballs, the left eyebrow, the tips of both the ears, part of the ribbon on the right side at the back and the ends of the ribbon by the neck have all been restored. The bun at the back has been cut off in modern times. On the herm is a modern inscription, "Myro". This head conforms to the Sappho type, as can be seen from the distinctive hairstyle and ribbon arrangement. Like the Munich and Madrid heads, this one is wider than the Naples example and it has the wide open eyes. The modern setting of the head in the bust forces the head to turn a little to its right, but the asymmetrical face, with a longer left eye and wider left cheek, suggests that it was intended to turn to its left, like the Munich head.

MELCHETT BUST Private collection, ex Melchett Collection. Strong (1928) no. 3. Bust. H. 0.54m. Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. 2nd century AD. Restored in marble are the tip of the nose and the right nostril, the centre and the right side of the upper lip, the inner half of the left eyebrow and the forehead above, the curls over each ear, the knot of hair at the back with part of the ribbon, a section of the neck, a small patch under the lower lip and another on the left side of the ribbon above the forehead. The bust was earlier in the Melchett Collection, to which it came from the collection of Sir Charles Robinson. A bust of a woman conforming to the Sappho type, known in the Naples herm and many copies and variants. True to type, this head has triple bands crossing it as well as one band coming forward to be tucked under the forehead band. This one slants to the right, the direction in which the head is turned. Also true to type, there are waves of hair going to the side between the first and second bands, waves going to the back between the second and third bands, and thick clusters of curls on the temples with low relief flame-like curls in front of the ears. But the low relief locks are unusually large and there is no ribbon tip in the middle of the forehead. The broad, oval face with a high forehead, full, mature features, the lips of the mouth apart, and almond-shaped eyes with only the upper lid carved, is similar to that of the Naples herm, though here the eyes seem wider open and the chin heavier.

BRITISH MUSEUM HEAD London, British Museum, 1829. Head. H. 0.305m. Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 70-90. The nose is restored. The curls on the side of the head, parts of the ribbons and the right ear are rather indistinct. The surface is a little pitted. The head was bought from A. Castellani in 1879. The head is of the Sappho type, with the recognizable hairstyle and hair bands. This copy shows well the layout of the hair on the top of the head. Waves of hair go to the side of the head between the first and second bands of the ribbon, while flatter and less wavy strands of hair go towards the back of the head between the second and third bands. Beyond the third band open curls fall backwards over the bun. This pattern is repeated on numerous copies of the type. See, for example, the two Tarquinia heads or the Riccardi herm. There are no long locks or ribbon ends descending on to the neck in this case. The face is soft and gentle in appearance, and Aphrodite has a very youthful air. Unlike the harder face of the Naples herm, and the broader faces of the Munich and Madrid herms, this more delicate head is akin to the two Tarquinia heads, the Riccardi herm and the head in the Vatican.

TARQUINIA HEAD I Ex Tarquinia, present location unknown. Head. H. 0.325m. Marble. From Tarquinia, Terme Dasumiane. AD 70-90. The end of the nose is missing and part of the bun has been restored. The back of the head and the bun, which were attached separately, seem to be ancient. There is some damage to the rim of the left ear and the hair next to it. This head, and a closely similar head of the same type, are reported to have been found in Terme Dasumiane in 1829. Both the heads were sold to Americans and spent some time in the Brandegee Collection in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. This head was sold at Sotheby's New York in May 1977 for $15.000 and again in New York at Sotheby's in December 1994 for $76.750. The head conforms to the Sappho type of the Naples herm head in its size, hairstyle and arrangement of hair bands. Like the Naples head, this head turns to its right. As a result, the hair on the left side is more fully treated and the band on the top of the head slants to the right. There are no locks or ribbons descending on to the shoulders. The youthful face, with large eyes and a small mouth, is similar to that of the British Museum, Florence, Tarquinia II, and Vatican heads, and quite unlike the more mature and forceful faces seen on the Naples herm or the Munich and Madrid herms, and the Villa Albani head.

Provenance unknown. Roman head on Renaissance bust. The head is mounted on a bust to which it does not belong. It has been put together from several fragments. The nose and a part over the left temple have been restored. The surface is weathered, especially around the eyes and mouth. The eyelids are almost gone. The curls on the temples are rather indistinct, and there is little trace of the low relief curls before the ears. The head and the bust are thought to have been put together in the 17th century. They were donated to the museum in 1755 by the Dowager Duchess of Pomfret. The head conforms to the Sappho type in the general layout of the hair with the crossing bands. The head looks a little different to the type because the front band is very narrow and it does not conceal the centre parting of the hair and the waves of hair going to the side,</page><page sequence="550">OLYMPIAS/SAPPHO 533 as it does in other replicas of the type. Furthermore, the typical band on the crown coming forwards, and the folded ribbon end in the middle of the forehead are not included. These variations seem to be due solely to the modern restoration of the front hair, so the head can be considered a true replica of the type. The ribbon ends are knotted beneath the bun at the back of the head and they can be seen beginning to go down the neck. The face is almost oblong in shape. The eyes are long and narrow, with heavy lids, not unlike the eyes of the Naples herm. In mid 5th century manner, there is no overlapping of the upper eyelids. BIBLIOGRAPHY Gardner, P.

The face is long and narrow and it is dominated by the enormous eyes which are rendered in great detail, with the incised iris, the hole for the pupil, the overlapping upper lids and the depiction of the caruncle in the inner corners. The lips too are large and very fleshy. The style of the face is decidedly late, and it is quite unlike any of the other replicas following this type. BIBLIOGRAPHY Becatti, G. (1969-1970) 38, no. 17.

According to Sichtermann's inventory for the DAI, Rome, the herm was in the possession of the art dealer U. Jandolo in 1913 and was bought in the same year by the interior decorator, Grassi, in Rome. This herm is of the Sappho type, as can be seen from the bands on the head, the bun, and the flame-like locks in low relief in front of the ears. The head turns gently to its right.

This head is a variant on the Sappho head type, made just over half the size of the Naples head and a number of other replicas which all agree closely in scale. Characteristic features, such as the three bands on the head, the bun at the back, and the thick mass of hair on the temples, are all reproduced here.

The head was made for insertion in a draped statue. The lower edge is uneven. The head turns slightly to its right, and the left shoulder is set back while the right points forward. The head is long and almost dome-shaped. The face is oval. It has regular features with a straight nose and thick eyelids around the almond-shaped eyes. The lips are full and the mouth is slightly open. It has been worked with the drill in the corners. The chin is round. The head is set off from the neck by a line running from ear to ear. Above the forehead a band can be seen. There are thick bunches of curls escaping from beneath the band on each temple. They cover the band at the sides as well as the front part of the ears. Below these thick curls are some small, flame-like waves of hair rendered in low-relief, two on the right side and three on the left. To the side and the back of the head and falling to the base of the neck are some long, wavy locks of hair, again rendered in low relief. The odd appearance of the head is produced by the fact that the skull is left roughly finished. The layout of the curls on the temple and the flame-like waves accord very closely with the Sappho type, as seen in the Naples herm example. Other similarities with this type are the facial features, the turn of the head, and the band on the forehead. But the denuded skull, lacking the usual thick waves of hair, the hairbands and the bun at the back, and the addition of thin strands of hair falling on to the neck detract from the likeness and suggest that the type was altered by the copyist to create a new effect. Perhaps the head was covered with a helmet or hair was added in stucco. The head may have been adapted for a portrait statue or for a statue representing Athena. Furtwängler was of the opinion that the head was left roughly finished on purpose, to be covered with a helmet.1311 He dated the head later than the Lemnia, but slightly earlier than Athena Parthenos. This led to an attribution of the head by other scholars to the Marathon monument, among other reasons, on the basis of its close relationship with the Tiber Apollo, which has also been associated with the group. 1311 Furtwängler (1895/1964) 90. He claimed that "the edge of the helmet is indicated just on the forehead."</page><page sequence="553">536 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Schuchhardt convincingly identified the head as that of an Aphrodite.1312 The goddess is wearing ribbons round her head, added in stucco along with more hair. Schuchhardt nevertheless maintained the attribution if not to Pheidias himself, then to his circle. Strocka followed Schuchhardt and attributed the Brescia head to the so-called 'Sappho' head type known in over eighteen replicas. He then further related this to the seated Olympias and attributed it to Pheidias.1313 BIBLIOGRAPHY Giuliano, A. (1984) 299 n.21. Harrison, E. B. (1984) 379-88. Harrison (1996) 25 n. 47.

RIACE BRONZES 19.1. A DESCRIPTION OF THE BRONZES Riace bronzes 'A' and 'B' are two rare examples of original ancient bronze statues in an excellent state of preservation (Figs. 19.1-5). They represent standing nude males and the remains of their attributes identify them as warriors. In height, proportions and pose, the two figures are strikingly similar. They stand with their weight on the right leg, the left leg relaxed and set forwards. The right arm is held down and the left bent at the elbow, originally carrying a shield on the forearm. In each case, the head turns gently towards the figure's right. The statues were carefully worked and finished. Copper was used to give colour to the lips and eyelashes, for example, while the teeth apparent on statue A were rendered in silver. The eyes were also coloured to give a life-like appearance to the statues. The leaner, flatter physique of statue B, which is treated in a more naturalistic manner than that of statue A, coupled with his more relaxed pose, give some degree of individualization. But it is in the treatment of the heads that the statues are most obviously differentiated. While statue A has a broad face with very strongly marked features, abundant locks of hair and a thick, curly beard, statue B has a leaner, more mature face, short hair, with very little volume to it, and a straighter beard arranged in wavy layers, with thicker curls appearing only at the bottom (Figs. 19.1, 4 and 5). The two bronzes were found in 1972 off the coast of the southern side of Calabria, at Riace Marina, near Reggio di Calabria. In the water there were also remains of a ship and several amphorae, some of the sherds actually sticking to the bronzes. The relationship between the ship, the amphorae and the bronzes is yet to be established. The amphorae, which have been sorted into three main groups according to date, span several centuries from the Classical or Hellenistic period down to the 2nd-4th century AD.1314 The statues were apparently found lying neatly side by side covered in sand in shallow waters, at a depth of some five metres, about one hundred metres from the coast. If they had been jettisoned in a storm, or if they had gone down with a ship in a storm, then one would have expected to find them in much deeper water and probably not so close together. The inference is that they were found elsewhere, probably in the deep waters between Sicily and South Italy, and hidden, awaiting illegal sale. If this is true, then there may well be other statues, perhaps from the same group, awaiting discovery. The statues were both cast in one large section, consisting of torso and legs, and several smaller sections, including the head, arms, hands, genitals, the front halves of the feet and 1314 Panella (1984) 31-35. 541</page><page sequence="558">542 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the middle toes.1315 The hair and beard of statue A and the lower beard and the top of the head of statue B were cast whole and added to the finished bronzes. On statue A one can see that the ears were completely modelled on the head, even though they were later hidden from view by the addition of locks of hair. The thick and irregular castings of the head indicate that much of the artistic work went into the creation of this part of each statue. The wax working model of the head was painstakingly worked over to provide individual detail, and to transform substantially similar sculptures into unique masterpieces.1316 The tracer was used to add certain details after casting, but there is no sign of the chisel or the burin on the surface of the statues. This shows that almost all the details were already included in the wax model.1317 In most cases, the core material of bronze statues has not survived and in this respect the Riace bronzes are unusual, for inside them were found much of the clay cores as well as the metal support bars. The bars were made of sheet-iron hammered round wood, and they measured approximately 20mm by 20mm in cross- section. The statues had one main bar running from the neck down to the right ankle and another bar running from the pelvis to the left ankle. Statue B had a third bar down the length of the right leg.1318 The clay core consisted of a reddish clay mixed with hair and straw, which carbonized on casting. The reason for the inclusion of these organic materials was to ensure that the clay was porous enough to allow the escape of gases during casting.1319 The clay, which is typical of the Mediterranean basin, has been found to be compatible with clays from three areas in Greece, Argos, Delphi and central Euboea, as well as the area near where the statues were found, Sybaris in Calabria.1320 Formigli' s detailed study of the exterior and much of the interior of the statues led him to the conclusion that the indirect method of bronze casting was used to produce the greater part of both figures.1321 This technique involved making piece-moulds from a clay model. The piece-moulds were used to create an 'inter-model', as Haynes calls it, consisting of a clay core covered with wax and supported internally on metal bars.1322 The inter-model 1315 Formigli (1984) 109; Mattusch (1988) 204-07. Concerning the methods used to strengthen joints and enclose them on the inside as well as the outside, see Haynes (1992) 95 and Formigli (1984) 124ff. 1316 Mattusch (1996) 79. 1317 See Formigli (1984) figs. 33 and 34 for the addition of fine hairs with the tracer. 1318 Formigli (1984) 1 14, fig. 7. Formigli suggests that in statue A the leg armature was also used to secure the statue in its base, by projecting out of the bottom of the feet into a lead-filled cavity in the base (fig. 36a). Statue A has only one cavity under each foot, whereas statue B has two, therefore allowing for two lead tenons. 1319 Cf. IG I3 435, lines 20, 27, 53, 78, 86, and 1 13, for a modest but recurrent expense on clay and hair recorded in the building accounts of the great bronze Athena of Pheidias. See also Haynes (1992) 25. 1320 McCann (2000) 97. 1321 Formigli (1984) 107-42. In support of his views, see Haynes (1992) 35 and 47. 1322 Haynes (1992) 27-29.</page><page sequence="559">RIACE BRONZES 543 was then used to cast the bronze statue in the same way as the original clay model in the direct method of casting. Haynes agrees with Formigli in believing that the Riace bronzes had cast cores. In support of this view is the separate casting of the middle toe of each foot on both the Riace statues. This points to the common practice of producing simplified piece-moulds of a model and then casting the more awkward parts (typically middle fingers and toes) separately and welding them on.1323 Accepting the theory that the statues were made from piece-moulds, Mattusch suggested that they were both based on the same original model, the differences between them being sufficiently superficial to be introduced in the wax working model.1324 Leaving aside the question of the serial production of bronze statues, one should note that the thickness of the bronze walls of the Riace statues precludes the possibility that they shared the same master moulds.1325 The angle of the head, the distance between the feet, and the pose of the torso are too different in each case to permit this. Early analysis of the core material suggested that the cores were produced by pouring semi-liquid clay into a piece-mould, adding metal supports, and then leaving the core to set. A more thorough investigation of the statue cores by Melucco Vaccaro has revealed that both cores consisted of concentric layers of clay built up gradually around the armature. In the case of statue B, the layers are better defined and more separate, as if longer drying periods were allowed between fresh applications of clay.1326 The core layers are thinner and finer towards the exterior, the surface layer being made of a very fine clay slip. In neither case is the structure of the cores compatible with either the pouring of semi- liquid clay or the packing of more solid clay into wax-lined moulds. The layers indicate that the iron supports were inside the cores from the outset and that they were used to support the layers. Melucco Vaccaro concludes from this evidence that the Riace bronzes must have been made by the direct method of casting, and she supports this view by noting the absence of drip-marks on the inner surface of the bronzes, the sure proof that the indirect method of casting was used.1327 Against the objection that it is difficult to see how the statues could have been cast in sections if they were made by the direct method, she suggests that the inner surface of the bronzes, which is reinforced in places, provides evidence to show that limbs and other parts of the body could be attached or detached. Thus the direct method of casting would not have precluded the separate casting of different parts of a statue.1328 That the cores of the two statues were not treated in identical fashion is perhaps evidence in favour of the view that the bronzes issued from different 1323 Other examples of this practice are the middle fingers of the Delphi Charioteer, the middle toe of the right foot from the Porticello wreck, and the middle toes of the Hellenistic Ruler in the Terme Museum. See Haynes (1992) 47 and Formigli (1984) 108. 1324 Mattusch (1996) 64, 80, 221, 229. 1325 Formigli (1984) 1 12, figs. 3 and 4, shows that the walls are between 4- 12mm thick. 1326 Melucco Vaccaro (2000) 125-29. 1327 Melucco Vaccaro (2000) 131 n. 28.

As Haynes explains in some detail, there were several different ways of creating a cast core for the indirect method of casting and at least two of these started from the armature and worked outwards.1330 Furthermore, there is still no satisfactory explanation of how casting in sections might be compatible with the direct method, given the empirical nature of Greek sculpture.1331 The debate on this subject continues. Both statues are made of a tin bronze, with only traces of lead in the alloy. Statue A has around 1 1% tin in the main body, while statue B has around 10% tin. The usual tin content in large-scale bronzes dating from before the 4th century BC has been found to be between 9- 12%.1332 One of Formigli's most important observations is that the alloy used for the bronzes varies from one part of a statue to another. The parts that were cast separately from the main body have a slightly higher percentage of tin. Statue A, for instance, has 12% in the right arm and 15% in the right hand.1333 Traces of cobalt, a substance which is entirely absent from other parts of the statues, can be found in the arms of statue B, in the copper nail which once held this statue's shield to the arm band, and in the shield handle of statue A. Formigli states that the metal alloy in statue B's arms is not found in large-scale bronzes before the Hellenistic period. From this and other factors, he concludes that the whole of statue B's right arm and the left forearm are later restorations. Ridgway's initial interpretation of the statues as classicizing works of the Roman period, 1st century BC/AD, has found little support, and it does not seem to accord with the technical analysis of the works.1334 For both technical and stylistic reasons, Rolley considers the bronzes to be Classical originals of Attic provenance, but he proposes different dates for each piece.1335 He dates statue A to around 460 BC, and statue B to around 430 BC, that is, after the conclusion of work on the Parthenon. In the case of statue A, Rolley points to parallels with the Delphi charioteer and the Artemision Zeus as, for example, in the treatment of the hair: some locks were made separately and then soldered on. In support of a later date for statue B, Rolley points to B's slightly more advanced stance and the more detailed rendering of his muscles. A date before or around the mid- fifth century BC for statue A may well have found confirmation in the existence of a lekythos by the Achilles painter, now in Berlin, bearing the figure of a standing male nude which is strikingly similar to statue A in all respects except the position of his right 1329 Melucco Vaccaro (2000) 127. 1330 Haynes (1992) 27, 29, 65. 1331 Haynes (1992) 38 and n. 20. 1332 Haynes (1992) 87-88. 1333 Formigli (1984) 120-22. 1334 Ridgway (1981) 237. 1335 Rolley (1986) 46-48.</page><page sequence="561">RIACE BRONZES 545 arm. 1336 Boardman does not find the differences between the two statues to be so marked as to suggest that they were created as much as a generation apart, and he dates both the works to the decade 460-450 BC.1337 The stance, with both feet flat on the ground, certainly seems more in keeping with a date before the mid century. De Grazia Vanderpool has studied two pairs of Roman statues which employ the same scheme and measurements as Riace bronze B.1338 The first two are the almost identical marble statues in Corinth of the adopted sons of Augustus, Gaius and Lucius Caesar.1339 The major differences are that in statue B the feet are about 2cm closer together than those of Gaius, the thighs have a smaller circumference, and the right arm is set further forward. De Grazia Vanderpool explains the first two differences in terms of the translation of the work from bronze to marble, like the addition of a tree-trunk support by Gaius 's left leg. But she thinks that the position of the right arm, held slightly closer to the body, may reflect the position of the original right arm of Riace statue B, before it was repaired.1340 The details of the statues are very similar, as can be seen, for instance, from the pattern of veins over the feet and ankles. But differences include the hair and the smoother surface treatment of Gaius, suggestive of his younger age, and the attributes. Gaius and Lucius have drapery over the left shoulder, while the right hands show that the object they once held had a rectangular rather than a cylindrical profile, as in the case of Riace statue B. The second pair with the same pose and scale as both the Corinth statues and Riace statue B are the Dioskouroi from the theatre of Lepcis Magna. The identity of these figures is apparent from the fact that they wear piloi and they have horse protomes by their right legs.1341 One of the statues still has its right arm and carries a sheathed sword. De Grazia Vanderpool finds it very likely that the identity of the Lepcis Magna statues casts new light on the significance of the Corinth portraits, in her opinion revealing the intentional flattery paid to the imperial family by means of the implied association of Gaius and Lucius with Castor and Pollux. De Grazia Vanderpool concludes that all four statues must derive from "a common and significant ancestor."1342 This work, she claims, was produced from the same master moulds as Riace statue B, but while statue B was given the attributes and surface finish 1336 CV A Berlin 8, 27-28, f. 3055, pls. 12-14. The Achilles Painter, one of the greatest of his generation, was active around 460-440 BC. See also Giudice (2000) 117-23. Giudice, 119, wonders whether the vase-painter was drawing directly on statue A for inspiration, and taking the liberty of altering his right arm, or painting a 'twin' of A (that is, a statue based on the same original model) that has not yet been discovered. 1337 Boardman (1985a) figs. 38-39. 1338 De Grazia Vanderpool (2000) 106-16.

The Roman statues in Corinth and Lepcis Magna are, therefore, not the direct descendants of Riace statue B, according to this theory, but collateral descendants, so to speak.1343 An interesting theory which may help to shed new light on the Riace bronzes is that proposed by Mattusch of the serial production of Greek bronzes.1344 According to this theory, one masterpiece, modelled in clay, was used to produce moulds from which any number of working models could be made. The outline, the proportions and the measurements of the working models would all have been the same, but the details and the attributes given to any finished bronze could be altered to suit requirements. However similar they may at first appear, the Riace bronzes differ from each other too greatly to be based on the same clay model, as Mattusch suggested. Nevertheless, it remains possible that the clay models used to create the statues were both regarded as excellent prototypes and that they were each employed to produce other, similar works. If the theory of serial production is correct, it would put into fresh perspective the production of Greek bronze statuary and the manner in which great masterpieces influenced later works. Once taken, moulds could presumably be packed up and moved to wherever they were needed. The reuse of a highly detailed and complex core seems less wasteful of an artist's work than the one-off creation associated with the direct method of bronze casting. Nevertheless, the effort involved in working over a wax model to answer new requirements would allow plenty of scope for the invention of other artists making use of moulds. 19.2. ATTRIBUTION TO THE MARATHON MONUMENT AT DELPHI The Riace warriors are so similar both in their general outlines and in their mode of production that it is tempting to believe that they issued from the same workshop, and even that they belonged to the same sculptural group. Like so many other works of Greek art, they were probably being transported from Greece to Italy when their ship went down. Their similar poses show that they could not be pendants. The metal analysis reveals that no parts of the statues are made from the same bronze mixture, as one might have expected if they had been the only two statues cast in one batch. They must have been famous works for statue B at least was used as the basis for the portraits of Gaius and Lucius in Corinth. 1343 De Grazia Vanderpool (2000) 113-15 speculates that the 'missing' statue on which the Corinth and Lepcis Magna statues may be based was the very well known Dioskouroi of Antiphanes of Argos. These were made for the Aigospotamoi Monument at Delphi, erected shortly after 405/404 BC. Riace statue B, she says, may have come from the same Argive workshop, and the "original model . . . might even have predated the Lacedaemonian monument." Given that Riace statue B dates from considerably earlier than the Aigospotamoi Monument, it is difficult to find such a link very plausible. 1344 Mattusch (1996) 64, 65, 221.</page><page sequence="563">RIACE BRONZES 547 According to Barron, the very apparent veins on the belly of statue B are closely paralleled in one other ancient Greek statue, and in no other, namely the Poseidon on the west front of the Parthenon, a work linked to Pheidias's circle. The anatomy also bears close comparison with figure D of the Parthenon east pediment. These factors indicate that the statues may have come from a large, well-known and recognizably Pheidian statue group. A theory that has found support with a number of scholars, in particular Fuchs, Giuliano and Barron, is that the two statues originally formed part of the Marathon dedication in Delphi by Pheidias.1345 Giuliano assumes that Pheidias already had a workshop in the 450s BC and that it was within this context that the Marathon bronzes were created. A link with Delphi was found in the shield strap on the left forearm of statue B (Fig. 19.5). Statue B was repaired in antiquity, having its right arm and lower left replaced with exact copies of the arms of statue A.1346 It is not yet known for certain whether the shield strap is part of the restoration or not. But, whereas the left forearm is closely similar to that of statue A, the shield strap differs with regard to the way it has been decorated, and it resembles very closely another shield strap that was found in Delphi.1347 The height of shield strap no. 536 from Delphi is variously reported as between 0.13m and 0.16m.1348 From the detailed measurements of the Riace bronzes, it can be deduced that statue B's strap is between 0.1 12 and 0.176 m high, so the sizes are within the same proportions. The Delphi shield strap belongs to a round shield known as the hoplon , the characteristic piece of equipment of hoplites and the item which gave them their name (Fig. 19.6). Measuring about one metre in diameter, the hoplon was slightly convex in shape, with a flat rim. It was built of wood, reinforced with bronze. On the inner side it had two features which were peculiar to its design and which accounted for its success: a bronze arm band, the TTÓpTTdÇ, and a leather handle, the avTiXaßT1. The arm band consisted of a bronze strip that usually ran right across the shield forming a loop in the middle, through which the left forearm was passed. The handle, which was originally set on the right-hand inner edge of the shield, was intended to be grasped with the left hand. Thus the weight of the shield was shared between the arm and the hand, and the soldier could let go of the handle when necessary without dropping his shield. The shield could also be held very firmly in an oblique position, making it much harder for enemy weapons to penetrate it.1349 The date of the Delphi arm strap is difficult to assess. For one thing the hoplon continued to be used for some three hundred years and, during this time, although the antilabe was developed, the 1345 See Fuchs (1982) 34ff., with further references, and Giuliano (1984). 1346 Rolley (1986) 46. 1347 Delphi Museum, inv. no. 4142. Max. H. 0.13-0.16m. Bronze. From Delphi. Date unknown. The arm strap is very well preserved. It was found at Delphi in the Gymnasium, in August 1898. It is a heavy and solid piece, weighing over 1kg, and its size would have been suitable for the arm of a strong man. Little attachment holes can be seen on each side of the strap. Fillets, with finely chased lines, adorn its central part. It is not certain whether the piece came from a real shield rather than that of a statue. Another strap of identical size and design has also been found in Delphi, but this one, number 536b, is much more damaged.

Added to this, the provenance is of little help with regard to dating for, like many sanctuaries, Delphi became a repository for all sorts of dedications made over the years and piled up all together. The fact that the type of the arm strap found at Delphi is very common weighs heavily against it as a possible link between the Riace bronzes and Delphi.1350 One should, therefore, be cautious about making bold assumptions, and it is probably wise to follow Rolley in stating that the Delphi shield strap does not belong to the Riace bronzes.1351 Another object thought by some to provide a link with Delphi is the helmet crest found by the entrance to the sanctuary, only a few metres from the location given by Pausanias for the Marathon monument.1352 Giuliano thinks the crest might have belonged to Riace B or to another statue of the same group.1353 This is in theory possible but it requires further investigation. One would have to look at the size of the crest and the history of the type. One would also have to discover the alloy of the bronze and compare it with the alloys of the Riace bronzes, though these show considerable variations. The size of the crest is known, but how it would be fitted on to Riace B is not quite clear. From measurements given for Riace B, to whose roughly worked skull a helmet, possibly with a crest, should be fitted, the crest seems quite large. But this may simply be an impression created by the fact that the head is seen without a helmet. It would be preferable to make casts of the two to see how they would fit together in practice. As in the case of the arm strap, there is no strong evidence to link the helmet crest with the Riace bronzes. A stronger link with Delphi may lie in the way the feet of statue B were attached to their base. According to Barron, this is quite a rare method of attachment, and one that is found in other statues at Delphi. The normal method of attachment consisted in pouring lead into the base of the foot which was then attached to lead poured into a hole in the statue base. In statue B lead was poured into two parts of the foot: the foot base and the front of the foot. 1350 further examples include one from Delphi, another from Marmaria, and a third from Olympia. See Perdrizet (1908) no. 536 fig. 367, and no. 536 bis; Olympia Museum, no. 1014. 1351 Rolley (1984) 327-30. Delphi Museum, 11679. Helmet crest. L. 575mm. Bronze. From Delphi. Possibly around 480-50 BC. The helmet crest is in fairly good condition, though the surface is corroded and green and the tail end of the crest is missing. There is also some damage to the helmet fixing. It was found (1 1/9/1978) beneath one of the stones of the Argive hemicycle at Delphi. It was being used to steady the stone. The helmet crest would have fitted a life-size helmet. It resembles a typical tripartite crest, consisting of the crest proper, the crest holder and helmet fixing, but these three parts were all made in one piece here. The crest holder is adorned with a simple meander pattern between two lines, rendered in copper on the bronze background. Originally, the pattern would have appeared dark against the burnished bronze. The crest is adorned with very fine and regular striations. Judging from the technique of the striations, Bommelaer reckoned that the crest was made in the Classical or Severe period, but not as early as the Archaic period, that is, considerably earlier than 369/368 BC when the Argive hemicycle was built. It was already damaged when it was used in this construction. Bommelaer wondered whether it might not have belonged to a statue which was damaged in the earthquake of 373 BC.

But there is no evidence to confirm that Nero's looting cleared out the sanctuary. He is supposed to have removed five hundred statues from Delphi but there could in theory have been thousands originally.1354 Shipwrecks containing Greek and Roman bronzes from a much later period do exist, and the argument cannot be considered convincing. The amphorae from the sea bed where the bronzes were discovered date from the Classical and Hellenistic periods to the 4th century AD. This would allow for a later removal from Delphi, though it is not clear how the pottery and the statues are related. Further study of the finds associated with the bronzes would probably be enlightening. Linking the statues with Delphi is hard enough. Even more difficult and speculative is the attempt to attribute them specifically to Pheidias 's Marathon Monument. Despite the difficulties, several scholars have attributed the Riace bronzes to the Marathon Monument and they have even gone so far as to try to associate them with some of the figures mentioned by Pausanias in X.l 0.1-2. Identifications proposed for the Riace bronzes have been Kodros and Leos for statue A, and Miltiades and Philaios for statue B. Without further evidence, it seems foolhardy to attempt such identifications. The superficial similarities between the Kodros gem in Heidelberg and Riace A and between the Miltiades herm in Ravenna and Riace B seem little to go on and they should probably not be given much weight.1355 More interesting perhaps is the distinction drawn by Busignani between the heroic, super-human nature of Riace A compared with the more human B.1356 Busignani found a "self-awareness" in statue B that is lacking in statue A. A photomontage shows statue B with the Corinthian helmet of a stratēģos, and the result appears to be quite a successful reconstruction. Statue B has short hair, a feature that distinguishes him from statue A, and it is perhaps yet another sign of the difference in character between the two figures. The origins and the identity of the two Riace bronzes remain uncertain, given the available evidence. The technical virtuosity displayed by the works, coupled with certain stylistic features, make Pheidian authorship possible, but the probable date of the Marathon Monument, perhaps in the decade 470-460 BC, might well exclude the statues from this particular monument. From the point of view of this study on Pheidias, the inestimable value of the Riace bronzes lies in the fact that they are rare original sculptures dating from his life-time, with much to reveal about contemporary styles and techniques. Whether or not one can go further and link the statues directly with Pheidias is a question which should probably be left open in the hope of finding further evidence. 1354 Pliny, NH 34.37, reports Mucianus as saying that there were three thousand statues in Rhodes in the 1st century AD, and he comments that it was generally believed that there were probably no fewer, nec pauciora, at Athens, Olympia and Delphi. 1355 See section 2 of the chapter on the Marathon Monument for further comments on these works. 1356 Busignani (1981) 106-10.</page><page sequence="566">550 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS 19.3. CATALOGUE 1. RIACE BRONZE A (Figs. 19.1-2) Reggio di Calabria Museum, warrior 'A'. H. 1.98m. Bronze. Found off the coast of Reggio di Calabria. 460-^50 BC. The statue itself is almost entirely preserved, apart from some of the ends of the copper eyelashes and the irises of the eyes, which were inserted within the ivory corneas. The attributes of the statue are lost. The position of the fingers show that objects were once held in each hand. The shield strap on the left forearm indicates that the left hand must have been occupied holding the hand strap within the rim of the shield. The right hand perhaps steadied an upright spear. There are also traces of a fastening for some object on the left hip. The figure may have had a sword. The head is bare and the details of the hair on the crown are carefully finished. Nevertheless, there are several indications that the figure originally wore a helmet of some sort. The skull is unnaturally elongated. There is a hole in the top of the head, as well as in the head band, above the ears, suggesting that there was something fitted to the head. Furthermore, beneath the head band at the back there is a ledge on the curls that would be suitable to support a helmet. The origin of this statue and the piece found with it, Riace bronze B, is not known. They were found in the sea in 1972, off the coast of Reggio di Calabria, along with the remains of a ship and some amphorae. It has not yet been established whether these finds belong together or not. The amphorae are thought to belong to the Classical or Hellenistic period, some to the 1st century AD, and some to a later period, between the 2nd and the 4th century AD.1357 The bronze statue of a naked man is closely similar in general outline and scale to statue B. The figure, who is well muscled and clearly in the prime of life, stands in Attic pose, with the right leg supporting the body, while the left leg, which is bent at the knee and set forwards, provides balance. Both feet rest fully on the ground. Ridgway notes the distinctive widening of the feet just before the small toe, which is found also on statue B.1358 The right hip is set somewhat higher than the left, but the strongly muscled torso is only mildly affected, remaining upright and rather stiff in appearance in the upper part. The nipples are picked out in copper. The head is turned to the figure's right. This movement causes a very slight turn of the shoulders to the right also, but without interrupting the basically frontal design of the statue. The right arm, which is lightly bent at the elbow, is lowered and the fingers are loosely curled. The left arm is sharply bent at the elbow. It is also drawn back a little and the muscles are tensed. The fingers of the hand curl tightly and a shield strap can be seen still attached to the left forearm. The head has an unnaturally high crown, and a broad, mature face with strong features and prominent cheek bones. Under a low brow are protruding, incised eyebrows, of which the curve follows the line of the eyes. The heavily lidded eyes are treated with great realism. Copper eyelashes are set above and below, while the eyeball is made of ivory, and 1357 Panella (1984), 31-35. 1358 Ridgway (1981) 237.</page><page sequence="567">RIACE BRONZES 551 was probably originally inlaid with coloured vitreous paste. The long straight nose follows the line of the forehead, with little sign of a ridge. The mouth has full lips, rendered in copper, and they are parted, revealing a row of silver teeth. Except in the middle, the upper lip is completely hidden by a thick and carefully combed moustache. On the top of the head the hair is worked in shallow, wavy grooves. A wide, flat band encircles the head, passing above the ears and low over the forehead. Jutting out and forming a ledge at the back, it would have helped to support the weight of the helmet. Below the band, the hair is treated in a completely different manner and given much more volume. Two wavy locks appear to emerge from beneath the band above the nose. They follow the line of the band to each side of the head and then fall over the temples in thick ringlets. The back, the sides of the head and the ears are hidden by similar curling locks, which were cast solid and attached to the finished head. The hair of the beard is also arranged in thick, extensively undercut curling locks, many of which may also have been made separately and then added. Such a mass of hair adds considerable volume to the head, making it appear much more impressive and powerful. In general, the treatment of physical details on this statue is less naturalistic than on statue B. Rolley draws attention to two specific features: the perfectly regular equilateral triangle which sinks down in front of the shoulder, at the point where the collar bone, the deltoid muscle and the trapezius meet, and the decorative treatment of the tendons joining the toes to the upper part of the foot.1359 Neither of these features appears on statue B. One might also point out the slightly arched line of the pubic hair, a feature which does not occur on statue B, and which disappears from Greek art after the mid 5th century BC. 2. RIACE BRONZE B (Figs. 19.3-5) Reggio di Calabria Museum, warrior 'B'. H. 1.97m. Bronze. Found off the coast of Reggio di Calabria. 460^50 BC. The statue is very well preserved. The head and the upper part of the ears are unfinished. This fact, along with the triangular shape of the head above the brow, the holes in the ears, and the little supportive ledge that can be seen at the back of the head above the nape, suggests that the head once wore a helmet. The remains of a shield strap on the left forearm prove that the figure also carried a shield once. There are traces of a fastening on the left hip for some other object, perhaps a sword, and the loosely curled position of the right hand, within which there remains some lead, suggest that the figure held another object on this side, possibly a vertical spear. The right eye, complete with copper lashes, ivory cornea and iris of vitreous paste, is well preserved, lacking only the pupil, but the left eye is completely lost. The end of the right index finger is missing too. The lead content of the right arm and the left forearm reveal that these were replaced in antiquity. The top of the head was cast separately and added to the finished bronze. The origin of this statue and the piece found with it, Riace bronze A, is not known. This bronze statue of a naked man is almost identical in height, proportions and configuration to statue A. The differences suggest that a slightly older man is represented here, in a pose which is more relaxed and generally less aggressive and alert than that of 1359 Rolley (1986) 37-38.</page><page sequence="568">552 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS statue A. He stands in Attic pose, but with the left leg not placed so far forwards and the feet held slightly closer together. The déhanchement is much more strongly marked, giving the torso a more curved attitude. The shoulders turn a little to the right, as on statue A, even though the turn of the head in this direction is considerably less significant than on statue A. The right forearm is held a little higher than that of statue A, while the left arm is not drawn back and tensed in the same way. The musculature of the body is treated in a noticeably different way from that of statue A, being considerably leaner and flatter. Statue B is generally treated in a less stylized manner. The line of the pubic hair is also straight rather than arched, as became common after the middle of the 5th century BC. The impression given by the head is quite different from that of statue A, even accounting for the fact that its appearance is marred by the loss of the helmet. The head is longer and narrower than that of statue A. These aspects are accentuated by the treatment of the hair and beard. On the head, the hair provides little volume. Small curls that cling to the head escape from under the helmet on to the brow. Short, flat waves and curls also cover the temples and go round the back of the head in an arched shape, but they leave the ears and most of the neck uncovered. The neck is very thick and strong. The beard is long and it is arranged in wavy layers of combed locks in one mass, which separates into individual curls only at the bottom. The moustache is quite short, though it still covers most of the upper lip. As in statue A, the lips are covered in copper, but they are less parted and no teeth are apparent. Perhaps most striking is the much softer treatment of the eyes. The eyebrows are finely indicated and they follow the line of the profile, rather than forming an unnatural mass that sticks out from the head, as on statue A. The eyes are larger than on statue A and wide open. A small and realistic amount of the upper eyelids can be seen, and this contrasts with the strongly marked sockets of statue A's eyes and its heavy upper eyelids that hood the eyes and accentuate the shape of the orbits.</page><page sequence="569">RIACE BRONZES 553 19.4.

With relative agreement, they depict an impressive standing male figure, draped in a voluminous himation. The figure is just under 2m tall. He stands upright, and although much of his weight is on his left leg, the right leg, which is set forwards and a little to the side, also bears some weight, with the result that there is not a marked displacement of the hips. He wears sandals, and his feet rest fully on the ground. The right arm hangs down, while the left is bent at the elbow, and the outer part of the wrist rests on the side of the pelvis. The left hand is open and clearly held no attribute, but the right seems to have supported a staff or spear, or some such object. The figure's head is erect and turned very slightly to his right. The face is broad and mature and it is made impressive by the great mass of curly hair which covers the head and which merges with a thick, curly beard. The hair covers the ears and much of the neck and it is arranged in a mixture of tight and open curls. These aspects give a somewhat dishevelled and windswept appearance to the hair, and they contrast with the carefully arranged parting and the combed moustache which can be seen on several replicas. See, for example, the Dresden and Terme pieces. The impressive, upright head and the position of the left arm lend the figure a confident, self-assured air. The himation is very carefully arranged. A triangular overfold hangs over the lower torso and left side. The himation covers much of the legs. It is brought round the back of the figure and then falls over the left shoulder in a thick bunch of folds. The lower ends of the himation can be seen hanging down the figure's left side. At the front the right shoulder and much of the torso are left bare, but these are covered at the back by a single layer of the himation which clings quite closely to the body. The right leg is modelled through the drapery. The body type exists in two replicas only: the statue in Dresden and the torso in Olympia. Of these the Olympia torso is of a high quality and it is perhaps the replica which comes nearest to the original statue. The support hidden beneath the folds of the himation suggests that the original was made of bronze. There is disagreement as to how many replicas should be considered directly related to the type seen in the Dresden Zeus. Vierneisel-Schlörb has identified six replicas, contrary to Curtius, who would include more.1360 The replicas Vierneisel-Schlörb includes are the statue in Dresden, the torso in Olympia, the herm in Munich, the heads in the Terme Museum and ex-Heyl Collection and, as the only close variant, the head in Holkham Hall. Tiverios lists the Dresden, Olympia and Munich pieces as the main examples of the type and, following Curtius and Paribeni, he adds a head from the temple of Olympian Zeus at 1360 Vierneisel-Schlörb (1979) 147-48; Curtius (1931) 20ff. 555</page><page sequence="572">556 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Cyrene.1361 This piece has not been included in the present study, as the arrangement of the hair, both on the head and in the beard, seems too far removed from the type. On the Cyrene head the hair is arranged in waves close to the skull on the crown, and then it is rolled up at the back and on the sides. The parting is not in the centre, and there are ringlets in front of the ears. Canciani does not class the Cyrene head with the Dresden Zeus type either, but treats it separately.1362 Tiverios regards the Heyl head as a variant because of the oak wreath, but this is probably a later restoration.1363 It should be noted that, in addition to the pieces included in the present catalogue, there are two other works which may be related to the type. The first is a head in Sparta Museum {EA 1317), which is of late date. It is in a bad condition, with much of the forehead missing and the lips very battered and broken. It measures 0. 35m in height and it is made in fine-grained marble. There is a wreath around the head. The second is a torso in the Vatican Magazine, earlier in their garden {EA 800). It is heavily restored and the head does not belong. Despite the fact that the workmanship of the torso is poor, the stance and the drapery follow the type. This work measures 1.90m in height, including the head, and it is made of fine-grained white marble. The drapery, the hairstyle, the stance and the massive build of the torso which characterize the design of the Dresden Zeus type all seem to have their origin in Athenian sculpture of the 430s BC. In particular, the type seems to be closely related to the sculptures of the Parthenon and other works associated with the Parthenon masters. Hölscher had suggested a date in the 420s BC, but this has been rejected as too late by both Despinis and Vierneisel-Schlörb.1364 The himation is disposed in a similar manner to that of Apollo on east frieze slab VI, figure 39, an arrangement which is repeated a number of times on the Parthenon frieze.1365 The treatment of the folds on the mantle of figure L of the east pediment may be compared with the Olympia torso. Even more striking perhaps are the similarities between the depiction of folds over the right legs of the Dresden Zeus and the Nemesis at Rhamnous by Agorakritos. The use of rounded folds, set back to back, in a very decorative and artificial arrangement, can be observed in both cases. So too can forked folds. Both of these devices appear frequently on the Parthenon frieze. See, for example, E.VI.48, where the back to back rounded folds are used over the relaxed leg and forked folds are used on the thick bunch of folds around the torso, just as they are on the Dresden Zeus. For the hairstyle one may compare the closely similar Poseidon on E.VI, as well as some of the bearded mortals standing nearby, in particular E.VI.45 and 46. The head contour of the Dresden Zeus is similar to that of Dionysos, E. III. 25. The same sort of squareness and massive build can be seen in torso H, which is thought to come from the 1361 Cyrene, inv. 14.129, cat. no. (11) 35, fig. 11.5.

For the position of the left hand, resting on the figure's side, compare E.II.19. 20.2. ATTRIBUTIONS The Dresden Zeus statue type has been dated and interpreted in many ways. It has been dated anywhere between around 440 to 420 BC, and it has been identified as Hades, Asklepios, Zeus and even one of the Phyle heroes. Asklepios should be ruled out as he does not appear regularly until the turn of the 5th century BC. So too should Mingazzini's suggestion identifying the statue with the Zeus Horkios in the bouleuterion in Olympia, dating from around 360-330 BC.1367 The attribution followed by most scholars is that suggested by Despinis in his work on Agorakritos.1368 The original of the type is thought to have been a bronze statue of Zeus Katachthonios or Hades in a joint sanctuary with Athena Itonia in Boeotian Koroneia, made by Agorakritos. It is described as a 'Zeus' by Pausanias and, according to Strabo, the god possessed a chthonic character.1369 These statues belong to the period 440-430 BC. The fact that there is no obvious viewpoint for the Dresden statue supports the idea that it formed part of a group composition and was counter-balanced by at least one other work. Despinis has identified the Athena from the Koroneian sanctuary as the original of the Athena Hope/Farnese type. The stylistic parallels between the Farnese type and the Nemesis from Rhamnous type might strengthen his theory, though Lauter considers the similarities to be of such a general character that they cannot determine whether or not both types were sculpted by the same person.1370 Despite later scholars' scepticism about the possibility of attributing parts of the Parthenon frieze to individual artists - Buschor, for example, tried to ascribe to Agorakritos east slab IV with the Dionysos who has a similar head contour to that of the Dresden Zeus - the parallels that can be seen between the design of the Dresden Zeus and the Parthenon sculptures certainly suggest that the type goes back to Pheidian circles.1371 Andren associated with the Hades of Agorakritos a slightly different head type, known in at least two replicas: the 'Barberini' head in the Milles collection and another head in 1366 Note, however, that Palagia (1993) 25-26, 30, has recently suggested that H does not belong to the Parthenon figures. 1367 Mingazzini (1969-70) 70, 71ff. For the Zeus Horkios, see Pausanias, V.24.9-1 1. 1368 Despinis (1971). 1369 Pausanias, IX.34.1; Strabo, 9.2.29. 1370 Lauter (1976) 47 n. 143. 1371 Buschor (1948) 115, fig. 88.</page><page sequence="574">558 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Naples.1372 Despinis rejected this association and emphasized the close relationship between the Milles-Naples type and the east frieze heroes which, he thinks, might have had the same model: the Pheidian Phyle heroes of the Marathon Monument at Delphi.1373 But, as Vierneisel-Schlörb asserts, it is unlikely that Pheidias kept to the same type over a span of fifteen to twenty years. Hölscher suggested that the Milles-Naples head type derived from one of the statues of the ten Attic Phyle heroes in the Athenian Agora.1374 This is based on a low date of around 420 BC for the related Dresden Zeus. Despinis rejects the theory on the grounds that the Agora monument, which dates from about 430-425 BC, is too late for the head: the Milles-Naples head is to be dated before the completion of the Parthenon east frieze in the 430' s BC. The relevance of the Milles-Naples head to the Dresden Zeus is still questioned, and it is difficult to draw any precise conclusion about the relationship between these two types of bearded men. Most recently Canciani has suggested that the Dresden Zeus type is more likely to represent Zeus than Hades.1375 One of the extant copies, perhaps the finest, comes from the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. Furthermore, a statue of Balbinus in the guise of Zeus shows a closely similar arrangement of the himation.1376 20.3. CATALOGUE 1. DRESDEN ZEUS (Fig. 20.1) Dresden Museum, 68. Dresden Zeus. Statue. H. 1.95m. Marble. Provenance unknown. AD 130-150. The statue is well preserved, though there has been some restoration to the arms and the drapery over the support. The name-piece of the so-called Dresden Zeus type is a slightly over life-size statue, which represents a standing, bearded man, draped in a himation. The weight is disposed on his left leg, while the right leg is set forwards and turned slightly outwards. Both feet, which have thin-soled sandals, are placed flat on the ground. The head is turned a little to the figure's right. The right arm is lowered, and the fingers of the hand obviously once held an object, which is now lost - something long and thin. The left arm is bent at the elbow and the outer side of the wrist rests on the pelvis, somewhat to the back of the figure. The hand is open and the fingers hang down. The himation is arranged in such a way that a long triangular overfold falls over the left side. The cloak covers much of the legs, goes round the back of the figure. It then falls over the left shoulder and upper arm in a thick mass of folds. The cloth is also spread over the 1372 Andren (1962/1963) and (1965). Curtius had suggested that the Dresden Zeus was a variation of this type, but Mustilli (1933) 1 1 correctly showed the latter to be an independent type. 1373 Despinis (1971) 141-42. 1374 Hölscher (1969) 410ff. 1375 Canciani (1997) 433. 1376 For this work, see Niemeyer (1968) 1 12, no. 125, pl. 46.</page><page sequence="575">ZEUS IN DRESDEN 559 right shoulder blade and it sits like a collar around the back of the neck. Close folds gather at the waist. The right leg is modelled through the drapery with a series of decorative lines and catenary folds reminiscent of those on the right leg of the Nemesis at Rhamnous. More folds descend next to the left leg, masking the statue support. The two lower corners of the cloth, which are weighted, are visible near the ground on this side. At the back, curving lines ascend from the right leg up to the left shoulder and this contrasts with the strong vertical lines which fall from the shoulder down the left leg. The cloth over the back on the right side clings closely to the body, giving a wet look to it, and there are some swirling lines reminiscent of those over the front of the right leg. The hair on the head is thick and rather dishevelled. It is parted in the middle. Thick, serpentine curls, some closed, some more open, cover the head, hiding the ears. At the back, long waves of hair fall over the nape of the neck. Above these, curls spread away from the back of the head towards the sides in a windswept fashion. The figure also has long, carefully combed moustaches and a thick, curly beard with numerous hook curls. His face is serious. There is a slight furrow in the brow and creases run from the nostrils along the line of the moustache. The eyes are large and quite heavily lidded, the long, straight nose has flaring nostrils and the slightly parted mouth has thick, fleshy lips. The lower lip is particularly full. Although carefully made, the statue as a whole appears dry and hard in its style and execution. BIBLIOGRAPHY Boardman, J. (1985a) fig. 228. Curtius, L. (1931) pls. 2 and 3, pl. 4, fig. 10.

Torso. H. 1.91m (plinth H. 0.065m). Marble. From Olympia. AD 160-180. For many years the torso alone was known. Several more fragments, mainly from the drapery on the legs, have since been recovered and joined to it. Missing pieces include the head, the right forearm, most of the left arm, most of the lower legs, the feet, and some parts of the drapery. The sculpture was found built into a wall close to the north-east corner of the Gymnasium at Olympia. According to Bol, it comes from the Nymphaeum of Herodes Atticus. The Nymphaeum had sculptures placed in two tiers with a Zeus type statue in the middle of each tier. The statue discussed here is thought to have been placed in the upper tier along with statues of the family of Herodes Atticus. In the lower tier there were portrait statues of the Imperial family, led by those of Antoninus Pius and Hadrian. This fragmentary torso of the Dresden Zeus type is slightly larger in scale than the Dresden statue. In pose and drapery, this piece closely follows the Dresden statue, but the quality of the carving is far superior, giving a much more graceful result. The folds at the back of the figure appear far flatter than on the Dresden statue.</page><page sequence="576">560 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS BIBLIOGRAPHY Bol, R.

The piece is in quite good condition, though much of the nose is broken away. The left eyelid and the upper lip are chipped and there is some damage to the surface of the face and the locks of hair. The head was acquired from the Tartaglia Collection in Rome in 1927. This head of the Dresden Zeus type is approximately the same size as other copies of the type. The face and hair follow the general scheme of the Dresden statue. And yet the upper eyelid is lower over the eye, the moustaches lack the detail of the Dresden head and, although the layout is carefully maintained, the hair is generally treated less carefully.

Pentelic marble. Provenance unknown. AD 160-170. Until 1954 the head was mounted on an alien torso, which is also at Holkham Hall, in the Game Larder. It was then cleaned and restored in the British Museum, and it is now exhibited by itself in the Smoking Room, as a pendant to a head of Plato. The marble has breaks in several places, which have been mended. The end of the nose and part of the right side of the neck, at the back, are missing. There is a small drill hole on a lock of hair on the right side. Many of the locks of hair look worn. The head was acquired by Thomas Coke, first Earl of Leicester, in Rome in 1717 for 400 crowns. This colossal, bearded head is described by Angelicoussis as a free adaptation of the Dresden Zeus type. Conforming to the type, it has deep-set eyes with thick lids, a low, broad forehead with a horizontal depression accentuating a bulge over the nose, and creases in the skin beneath the cheeks. But the eyes are relatively small, and they are asymmetrical, the right being larger than the left. This difference in the eyes, which is coupled with a flatter treatment of the left cheek, suggests that the head was designed to be viewed primarily three-quarters from the left. Like the eyes, the mouth too is relatively small but the lips are thick and fleshy. As on the Munich herm, the lips are well parted, unlike the Dresden statue and the Terme head, where the lips are set closer together. The hair is generally arranged following the scheme of the type, but in a more simplified form. It is parted in the middle and its thick, somewhat disorganized mass covers the head, hiding the</page><page sequence="577">ZEUS IN DRESDEN 561 ears and the nape of the neck. Unlike other copies, however, the moustaches and the individual locks of hair are treated in thicker masses of stone and there is less detail. The careful pattern of short, neat waves of hair on either side of the central parting, terminating in little waves rising up from the forehead, which one sees clearly on the Dresden and Terme examples, is altered to give a freer appearance to the hair: there are no small waves rising up from the forehead and the locks of hair from the parting extend further on each side. These are also more deeply cut. The result is less fussy than the Dresden statue. As in the case of the Dresden head, monotony is avoided by giving a slightly different treatment to each side of the head, so that the layout of the curls is not exactly repeated. In addition, the beard is parted slightly to the left of centre. There is a plaster copy of the Holkham Hall head in the Munich Art Academy (EA 869-71). BIBLIOGRAPHY Angelicoussis, E.

There is minor damage to the face and hair. The nose and the oak wreath have been restored. There is a crack along the lower edge of the wreath, suggesting that the wreath was added later. Formerly in Darmstadt, in the Heyl Collection, the head was offered for sale in 1930, but withdrawn. It was sold at a second auction in 1932. Its present location is unknown. This head is a variant on the Dresden Zeus type, wearing an oak wreath. In facial features and hair layout, this head follows the general scheme of the type. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bulle, H. &amp; Langlotz, E.

The head is approximately the same size as other copies of the type. The remains of the drapery on the left side of the neck confirm the identity of the type, which is already clear from the arrangement of the hair and the facial features. But, unlike the Dresden statue, or even the less detailed Terme head, this work has hair which is much more sketchily rendered and which is dominated by wavy hair rather than proper curls. The fleshy lips are also more widely parted than on the Dresden statue. BIBLIOGRAPHY Tiverios, M. (1997) 326, no. 78c. Vierneisel-Schlörb, B. (1979) 147-52, no. 13. 20.4. BIBLIOGRAPHY Andren, A.

THE NAME OF THE TEMPLE The name 'Parthenon', as applied to the whole temple, can be traced back to about the mid 4th century BC, in the writings of Demosthenes, who twice refers to the temple in this manner. Amongst later writers this name became standard. But in earlier writings the Parthenon was often referred to simply as 'the temple', leaving one in no doubt about the function of the building.1377 The name 'Hekatompedon' or 'Hekatompedos neos', which was used almost interchangeably with 'Parthenon', to refer to the whole temple, first occurs in the writings of a contemporary of Demosthenes, Lykourgos.1378 It is used several times by Plutarch, as well as by other writers.1379 Plutarch even conflates the names, calling the temple €kcltÓ[it'€Sov napGevwa in Per. 13. 1380 The 5th-^kh century BC inventory lists of the Treasurers of Athena, which survive in fragmentary form, give details of many of the treasures of the goddess which were housed in treasuries on the Akropolis. Four of these treasuries were the Hekatompedos neos, the Proneos, the Parthenon, and the Opisthodomos. The location of these strong-rooms is not known for certain, but some if not all of them formed part of the temple of Athena Parthenos. The 'Hekatompedos Neos' is clearly identified in the inscriptions as the east chamber of the temple, which housed the image of Athena.1381 The name apparently reflects the approximate length of the chamber. The internal length of the chamber is 29.786m; the length including the width of the back wall is 30.939m. According to de Waele, the 1377 Demosthenes, C. Androt. 13 and 76. For the use of the name 'Parthenon' in later writers, see, for example, Strabo, Geogr. 9.1.12 and 16; Pausanias, 1.1.2, 1.24.5, and VIII.41.9; Plutarch, Per. 13; Himerios, Eel. 31.8; Zosimos, IV. 18; Marinos, Vita Pr. XXX. For the Parthenon simply referred to as the4 temple', see, for example, the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, drawn in part from Philochoros, as well as Xenophon, Hellen. 2.3.20, and Aristotle, Hist. Anim. 6.24. Roman writers too occasionally referred to the Parthenon in similar manner: see, for example, Cicero, In Verr. II. 1.45, and Lucretius, De Rer. nat. 6.749-52. 1378 Kata Kephisodotou , Glossa Patmia, BCH 1 (1877) 149. 1379 Plutarch, De Soll. Anim. 32; Cat. Mai. 5; De Glor. Ath. 8. 1380 Though his explanation of the use of the term Hekatompedon for the entire building is unsatisfactory, Harpokration correctly states that to describe the Parthenon as a Hekatompedon gives no information about the length of this building, for it was well over two hundred feet long. Harpokration, Suda , E, 368. 1381 See, for instance, IG II2 1407, lines 6-7. 565</page><page sequence="581">566 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS temple foot unit was a non-standard length of 30.7cm, not the longer Doric foot of 32.6-8cm, as previously thought.1382 Thus the internal length was 97ft and the length including the back wall was 1003/4ft. It is not clear, however, whether the name 'Hekatompedos Neos' originated from the length of the east chamber of the temple or whether it reflects the survival of a much older name, either that of an older 100ft temple, or of a 100ft sacred area, perhaps once occupying the same site as the Parthenon.1383 The inscriptions make it clear that the east chamber was not the 'Parthenon' for the treasures of the 'Hekatompedos Neos' and the 'Parthenon' were inventoried on separate tablets and they housed completely different objects.1384 Apart from the great chryselephantine statue, the Hekatompedon did not house much other treasure until after the Peloponnesian War, when items from other stores were moved into it. In the 4th century BC it contained large numbers of gold and silver wreaths, as well as military equipment, furniture, musical instruments, and vessels.1385 Many of these items would have been useful in the rites and festivals in honour of Athena. It is probable that the inventories of the treasures were initially made during the Panathenaic festival, perhaps after the procession when the sacred objects distributed for use in the procession were returned to the temple.1386 The key to the Hekatompedon was kept in the Chalkotheke, which was situated behind the Parthenon, next to the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia. The doors to the Hekatompedon were intricately adorned with animals' heads, gorgoneia, leaves and other motifs, some of which were made of gold. The 'Proneos' was used as a store from 434/433 BC until 408/407 BC, when all of its contents were transferred elsewhere, presumably to the Hekatompedon. The treasures of the Proneos were nearly all gold and silver vessels.1387 By 411 BC it contained one hundred and eighty-eight silver phialai and eleven drinking cups. It is generally agreed that the Proneos denotes the front porch of the temple, a space which was probably designed and certainly used as a treasury. It was deeper than the back porch and was adorned with a sculpted Lesbian cyma and an Ionic frieze over the cross-wall and the door between the Proneos and the Hekatompedon.1388 Metal grills between its columns prevented all except central access and the double doors at the front could be locked. The 'Parthenon' store was emptied around the end of the 5th century BC and after 399/398 BC its contents were listed on the Hekatompedon stelai, sometimes under a special heading €K tou napOevwvoç, but more often without any such division.1389 The Parthenon treasures were numerous and varied, and many of the items were quite bulky.1390 There were large quantities of furniture in this store (fifty-seven items are 1382 de Waele (1984) 100. 1383 For this suggestion see Preisshofen (1977) 74ff. 1384 Harris (1995) 4. 1385 See Harris (1995) 104-200, for the relevant inscriptions and treasure lists. 1386 So Harris (1985) 10. 1387 See Harris (1995) 64-80. 1388 Korres and Bouras (1983) 668-69. 1389 For example, IG II2 1377, line 9. 1390 See Harris (1995) 80-103.</page><page sequence="582">PARTHENON 567 recorded in the first year of the lists), as well as military equipment, jewellery, wreaths, vases, musical instruments, statues and figurines. The Parthenon also originally contained the bronze stele with the inventory list of the Athena Parthenos.1391 It is generally assumed that the Parthenon refers to the large west chamber of the temple or possibly the west chamber plus the back porch.1392 Further, it has been claimed that the west chamber was so named because it was there that maidens ('the ergastinai') wove the Panathenaic peplos. According to this theory, the name gradually spread to the whole temple and it was for this reason that the statue became known as the 'Parthenos'. That the west chamber was an important treasury is proved by the fact that the great west door was strengthened on the inside with vertical iron bars hidden in the woodwork.1393 It is clear from the treasure lists that the 'Parthenon' store must have been quite large for it contained many items of treasure. This was all the property of the goddess Athena. Even though there is as yet no firm evidence to prove the point, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that this treasure was kept within Athena's temple and that the 'Parthenon' was indeed the spacious west chamber of the temple. In Harris's words, the suggestion that the Parthenon might refer to "a place outside the temple, is unlikely, not to say heretical".1394 On the other hand, there is no proof that the west chamber was ever used for weaving. Indeed, as Roux says, the windowless west chamber of the temple would have been a most unsuitable place for such work.1395 In peoples' houses the word TTapöevw simply meant the young women's chamber or bedroom. It is possible that this meaning was attached also to the back room of the temple. If, as suggested in Athena Parthenos, section 1, the tradition of a cult of Athena Parthenos on the site of the Parthenon temple had existed from long before the existence of the mid 5th century BC temple, then the possibility that the statue gave its name to the temple rather than vice versa becomes distinctly more likely. According to the Kallias decree (IG I3 52), the 'Opisthodomos' was to be used to house the money of Athena and that of the other gods, the two sums to be kept, respectively, on the right and left hand sides of this treasury. There are no extant inventories of the treasures in the Opisthodomos until very late in the 5th century BC. Then they list the treasures of the 'other gods' only. In 405/404 BC the Treasurers of Athena became responsible for the treasures of the other gods. They published annual lists of the contents of the Hekatompedon, and this included items which had been transferred 'from the Opisthodomos'.1396 Objects still in the Opisthodomos after this date were for a time also listed on the Hekatompedon stelai, under the rubric Tcxôe ev to) 'OmaOoSoļiū).1397 The Opisthodomos was probably cleared of all treasure in about 350 BC. Its treasures included 1391 See, for example, IG II2 1407, lines 6-7. 1392 So Harris (1995) 3-4. 1393 Stevens (1940) 74-77. 1394 Harris (1995) 4. 1395 Roux (1984) 305. 1396 See, for instance, IG II2 1378 and 1398, add. 797-98, lines 12-25, for 399/398 BC. 1397 See, for instance, IG II2 1388 B, line 73.</page><page sequence="583">568 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS anvils, hammers and dies for minting coins, money, gold and silver objects, vases, and thirty-eight sealstones.1398 It is sometimes argued that the Akropolis treasury known as the 'Opisthodomos' was also part of the Parthenon. IG II2 1457, line 20, reveals that when the doors of the Hekatompedon were damaged in the 4th century BC the pieces which broke off were stored in the Opisthodomos. As Harris points out, it would be reasonable to expect that the pieces from the door were stored in the same building as the doors to which they belonged.1399 Photios says that the treasurers were responsible for both the money that was kept in the temple of Athena as well as the statue of the goddess.1400 The statue to which he is referring here is the Athena Parthenos, so it is sometimes assumed that the temple to which Photios refers must be the Parthenon. Hurwit stresses that the 'Opisthodomos' is not mentioned in the sources before 434/433 BC, the date of IG I3 52. He assumes that this is the case because until then this particular Parthenon treasury simply did not exist.1401 If one accepts that the west chamber of the temple was the 'Parthenon', then one is left with the west porch as the only possible location within the temple for the 'Opisthodomos'. This space could quite legitimately be called an opisthodomos. Like the Proneos, it could be locked up and it would have been amply large enough to store the money and other items kept in the 'Opisthodomos' treasury. On the other hand, as Plutarch's story about Demetrios Poliorketes staying in the Opisthodomos of the Parthenon shows, the term 'opisthodomos' could be applied in a general sense to the Parthenon, to indicate the back room of the temple, without necessarily implying an identification with the Opisthodomos treasury.1402 Indeed, there seems to be little evidence to justify such an identification. The 'Opisthodomos' was famous in antiquity for all the money it contained and there are many references to it in the literary sources. It was apparently damaged by fire in the late 5th century BC and then broken into in the mid 4th century BC.1403 Several sources, all late, seek to elucidate the whereabouts of this famous treasury, but most of them are not very helpful. Many reveal no more than that it was on the Akropolis1404 and perhaps at the back of the Akropolis.1405 One source says that the opisthodomos was tò omcrOev tí1ç 06OÜ, meaning 'behind the goddess', another says that it was behind the adyton.1406 The word 'opisthodomos' does not generally refer to a free-standing building, but to the rear part of a building, usually a temple, as Photios explains in his Lexicon. And yet, some of the sources seem to suggest that this Opisthodomos did stand alone. IG I3 207 refers to the setting up of a stele perhaps in the vicinity of the Opisthodomos. Many sources state that 1398 Harris (1995) 40-63. 1399 Harris (1995) 3. 1400 Lex. tamiai, based on Aristotle, Ath.

This temple had always housed the most venerable and ancient wooden image of Athena Polias. When the Persians sacked the Akropolis, they did not find the image for the Athenians had removed it to Salamis for safe keeping. The usual view is that, from the later part of the 5th century BC, there were but two temples of Athena on the Akropolis: the Parthenon and the Erechtheion.1408 The Erechtheion was built between 421 BC and 405 BC, immediately to the north of the old temple and partially covering its northern colonnade.1409 It is assumed that the ancient wooden image of Athena was eventually rehoused in the new temple complex of the Erechtheion, once this had been completed. Where the image was kept in the interim remains a mystery, though various suggestions have been put forward. A reference in Herodotus, VIII.55, to a 'neos of Erechtheus' in the 440s BC suggests that the classical Erechtheion replaced an earlier sanctuary, possibly on the same site. Hurwit supposed that a small, temporary neos of Athena Polias may have been built to the north of the temple ruined by the Persians and close to the older Erechtheion, and that it was here that the ancient xoanon was housed until the late 5th century BC.1410 In his commentary on Vitruvius, Antonio Corso argues that at least a part of the old temple of Athena Polias was put back into use temporarily after 480 BC, as a home for the holy image, and then later removed to allow enough space for the construction of the Erechtheion complex.1411 He maintains that the famous 'Opisthodomos' treasury, which was apparently behind a temple of Athena and perhaps behind the temple of Athena Polias was in fact the western part of the old temple of Athena. The form of this chamber was unusual in that it consisted of an anteroom before two smaller adyta. Such a layout would fit in well with the decree of Kallias, mentioned above, stating that sacred money should be stored in the right and left parts of the Opisthodomos. Corso is of the opinion that the old temple of Athena Polias could not have been left standing after the Erechtheion complex was built. Apart from the lack of space, there would have been no need for it. For, according to Corso, the Erechtheion complex should be interpreted as two separate, if contiguous, spaces: at the east end of the temple complex was the Erechtheion proper, which Corso defines as the hexastyle porch and tripartite interior, while at the west end was a separate temple dedicated to the worship of Athena Polias. It consisted of the transversal naos, with ornate porches to north and south. Whether one is justified in assuming that the Erechtheion took over the functions of the temple of Athena Polias and even that it came to be referred to in similar terms is strongly 1407 So Anonymus, Etym. Magn Demosthenes, De Rep. Ord. 14, Photios, Lex. opisthodomos. That it was behind the temple of Athena Polias, see sch. (1193a) Aristophanes, Plut. 1193. 1408 Strabo, 9.1.16, states that the two temples of Athena on the Akropolis were the Parthenon of Iktinos and the ancient temple of the Polias, in which burned the lamp that never went out. 1409 See Lawrence (1983) 191, fig. 156, for a plan. 1410 Hurwit (1999) 143^4 and fig. 115.

But, as Ferrari points out, a decree of 46(M150 BC, some thirty years before the construction of the Erechtheion, refers to the setting up of a stele 'behind the arkhaios neos'.1413 Although Pausanias's description of the Akropolis is somewhat muddled, he definitely makes a distinction between the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Polias, both of which he visited.1414 A stele of 409/408 BC, which refers to the temple of Athena Polias housing the ancient statue as well as to the Erechtheion, is often taken as evidence that the two shrines were one and the same place.1415 But Ferrari is surely right to note that at that time the Erechtheion was still under construction and probably roofless, so it would have been out of the question to keep an ancient statue in it. In agreement with Dörpfeld, Ferrari insists that the 'ancient temple', referred to in the literary and epigraphical sources, was the archaic Doric temple of Athena Polias, damaged by the Persians in 480 BC, while the Opisthodomos was the west part of this old temple, a name which clung to it even after the temple was damaged.1416 The fact that the Porch of the Karyatids encroaches on the north foundations of the peristyle of the old temple shows that the peristyle would have had to be dismantled to make room for the classical Erechtheion, but there is no evidence, says Ferrari, that the whole of the old temple was taken down in antiquity. On the contrary, partially repaired, so that it could still be used as the repository of the old wooden xoanon and as a treasury, and partially left in ruins, the burned temple is seen by Ferrari as a poignant war memorial at the heart of the Athenian Akropolis.1417 1.2. POLITICS AND THE ROLE OF PERIKLES IN THE CREATION OF THE PARTHENON After a period of relative inactivity during the first half of the 5th century BC, Athenian architecture entered its richest and no doubt best known phase. From just after the turn of the mid-century, there was a marked increase in temple-building, both in and around Athens, and in addition the city was endowed with monumental gates, stoas, a theatre, an odeion and other important civic buildings. Not only is the number of monumental buildings erected in these years impressive, but so too is their splendour as individual works of art.1418 1412 Ferrari (2002) 11-35. 1413 IG I3 76, ó[mcj]0ev tô veô tô àpx[aío. 1414 Pausanias, 1.26.6-27.1. 1415 IGÝ 474.1. 1416 Dörpfeld (1885) 275ff. and (1886) 337ff. Concerning the Opisthodomos, see Ferrari (2002) 14-16. 1417 Ferrari (2002) 26 also thinks that the deliberate decision not to restore the old temple fully demonstrates the Athenians' "selective compliance" to the Oath of Plataia. 1418 Plutarch's admiration of these works is recorded in Per. 13.</page><page sequence="586">PARTHENON 571 No expense was spared: lavish amounts of marble, careful designs, complicated refinements and much sculptural decoration, of a very innovative nature, went into their making. But this period of growth was short-lived. By the end of the century, Athens was equipped with numerous new buildings, but she was also financially and physically exhausted after her unsuccessful struggle against Sparta in the Peloponnesian War, which dragged on from 431 to 404 BC. State architecture once again fell into the background and Athens - a centre of architectural development in the later 5th century BC - did virtually no monumental building until the time of Lykourgos. The political overtones of the massive building programme of the later 5th century BC are apparent in the circumstances in which the projects were undertaken. According to Plutarch, Perikles proposed that heralds should be sent out to invite the Greeks to send representatives to Athens to discuss the rebuilding of the temples destroyed in the Persian Wars, the fulfilment of sacrifices promised to the gods during this conflict and the policing of the seas.1419 The congress, however, never materialized because of the opposition of the Spartans who led the rest of the Greeks in a general boycott of the meeting. Since the so called Congress Decree, paraphrased by Plutarch, is not recorded in any other source, its authenticity has been doubted.1420 Meiggs, for one, points out that there are reasons to believe that it makes good historical sense.1421 Of course the Spartans would be opposed to a congress to be held in Athens to discuss the rebuilding of mostly Athenian temples and the maintenance of a largely Athenian fleet. At the same time it is highly plausible that the Athenians wanted the opportunity that such a congress would afford to justify their actions publicly. For, in effect, the Athenians were seeking a new sanction for the Delian League now that peace with Persia had been made. From subsequent events it is clear that even if there was no such decree, the Athenians were prepared to carry on with their plans alone. Financial collections from the Delian League, which perhaps resumed after a one year break in 448/447 BC following the Peace of Kallias,1422 continued to ensure that the seas were guarded by an Athenian fleet and, as we know from other sources, Perikles proposed and the people agreed that the means of rebuilding the burnt temples should be provided by money amassed as tribute from the Delian League.1423 The highly controversial motion to spend League money on Athenian temple construction, which is recorded by Plutarch, enraged many Athenians as well as their allies in the League, not to mention their rivals.1424 Some viewed the action as a disgraceful misuse of the funds. Many felt threatened by its strong political implications. League members were no longer free and independent states, but subservient to Athens, the glorious head of a large and important empire. And the oligarchs in Athens quickly recognized the danger to their cause which would be brought about by the creation of so many state-funded jobs for craftsmen and unskilled workers, whose allegiance to the democratic party would thereby be assured. 1419 Plutarch, Per. 17. 1420 See, for instance, Seager (1969) 129-41. 1421 Meiggs (1972) chapter 9. 1422 See Meiggs (1972) 153f. 1423 Anonymus Argentinensis, Strasbourg Papyrus Graeca 84. See Meiggs (1972) 133, lines 9-14 and note 2. 1424 Plutarch, Per. 12.</page><page sequence="587">572 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Plutarch, Per. 12, says that Perikles's plan for the construction of temples and public buildings was a measure which gave great pleasure to the Athenian people and amazed everyone else. As Meiggs makes clear, the building programme, approved, commissioned and supervised by the people, was a powerful statement of the rule of radical democracy at Athens.1425 Perikles's initiative concerning the building programme came at a time when Athens was ripe for new development. Until 479 BC, the Athenians were deeply involved in combatting the Persians and they had little leisure to indulge in peaceful pursuits - especially costly ones requiring a large workforce, such as temple building. After this date, their slowness to rebuild the damaged temples may reflect the poverty of the city after the wars and the need to concentrate on rebuilding houses and civic buildings first. But a more forceful reason for the delay may be found in an oath sworn by the Greeks before the Battle of Plataia and recorded by Diodorus Siculus, to the effect that no sanctuary burnt or demolished by the barbarians would be rebuilt but they would be left as a reminder to future generations of the impiety of the barbarians.1426 Diodorus was writing in the 1st century BC, but he was using the 4th century BC historian Ephoros as his source. Nevertheless, the existence of such an oath has often been doubted. Already in the 4th century BC it was dismissed as Athenian propaganda by Theopompos. But a remarkable number of religious sites is now known to have remained in ruins until the mid-fifth century BC: the temple of Poseidon at Sounion; the temples of Hera and Demeter on the road from Phaleron to Athens; sites in the lower city of Athens; and, despite Rhys Carpenter's claims, the Athenian Akropolis.1427 It is not known how long the oath was kept in force, but two significant events may be mentioned: the Battle of Eurymedon in 466 BC - in which the Persian fleet was completely defeated - and the Peace of Kallias, when peace with Persia was finally declared. The Peace of Kallias is traditionally dated to 449 BC but, according to Badian, its negotiation and implementation were probably lengthy and complex procedures.1428 Badian suggests that Kallias first negotiated for peace after Eurymedon, that the peace was not kept, and that Kallias renewed negotiations, this time with success, after the death of Kimon in around 450 BC. At any rate, as mentioned above, it was shortly after the turn of the mid century that Perikles's proposal to finance the rebuilding of the temples of Athens using League money was approved by the Athenians; and the first extant inscription concerning the building accounts for the Parthenon dates from the year 447 BC. Perikles was at the height of his powers in the period during which the Parthenon was constructed. In 45 1 BC his arch-enemy, Thucydides, was ostracized and every year from 443 BC until his death in 429 BC, Perikles was elected stratēģos. As far as one can gather from the sources, the driving force behind the project to rebuild the temples of Athens was Perikles. As an ardent democrat and imperialist, always hostile to the powers of Persia and Sparta, Perikles had an inspirational influence on the designers of both the Parthenon and 1425 Meiggs (1963) 44-45. 1426 Diodorus Siculus, XI.29.2. The oath is also quoted in much the same terms by Lykourgos, the 4th century BC orator ( Leokrates , 81), and it was found in an inscription of the 4th century BC at Acharnai in Attica. 1427 Rhys Carpenter (1970). 1428 Badian (1993) 19-20.</page><page sequence="588">PARTHENON 573 its sacred image of Athena. Although no inscriptions survive to prove the point, it seems likely that Perikles also had an official and legal role in the construction of these works. In the democracy, a board of elected supervisors, epistatai, was legally responsible for the correct management of all projects involving State funds. The epistatai, whose number and period of office may have varied for different projects, supervised the carrying out of the project and the keeping of treasury records, and they published the accounts when the project was complete. In the case of the Athena Parthenos, of which some of the accounts inscriptions survive, the annual secretary to the board of epistatai and the treasurers are named each year, but the epistatai, of whom there was clearly a good number, are never named.1429 From this, it is perhaps correct to infer that the epistatai in charge of the statue remained in post for the whole ten year building period. According to Philochoros, Perikles was epistates for the construction of the Athena Parthenos, riepiKXeous êmaTaTowTOs.1430 In the case of the Parthenon, where fragmentary names of epistatai survive in the extant accounts inscriptions, it is clear that the epistatai were annually elected and they probably numbered about five.1431 Perikles's name does not appear in the surviving fragments, but it is again possible that he served for a time as epistates on this project. At any rate, that is what Strabo, using the same phrase as Philochoros, would have one believe.1432 Neither Philochoros nor Strabo allude to the fact that Perikles would not have fulfilled the role of epistates on his own, but as one of a board of colleagues. It is possible that Plutarch misinterpreted these sources, not fully understanding the word epistates. For he seems to suggest that Perikles was wholly responsible for the building programme of the 440s and 430s BC. But in the Athenian democracy of the 5th century BC, such a project was unthinkable without the approval and control of the popular assembly and it was only through his influence on this body that Perikles could have succeeded in realizing his ideas. The political motivation for the building of the Parthenon finds expression both in the architecture of the building as well as in its sculptural programme, as displayed in the temple metopes, frieze and pediments and in the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias. The significance of the sculptures is considered in the chapter on the Athena Parthenos, section 7. Concerning the architecture, the discussion will focus on the use of Ionic features in this temple. Athens, like the rest of the mainland, had traditionally been a centre for the Doric order, but in the later 5th century BC both mixed Doric-Ionic temples - the Parthenon and the Hephaisteion - and purely Ionic temples - the Nike temple, the Erechtheion and the Ilissos temple - were constructed here. In juxtaposing Ionic and mixed Doric-Ionic temples in one city, Periklean architects were both stepping beyond established traditions and reflecting in a singularly appropriate way the political aspirations of their generation. That the new fashion developed out of established tradition and was not simply invented by these architects is clear from the fact that Ionic had already been employed beyond Ionia and the Cyclades in the Archaic and early Classical periods. In the Archaic period, Ionic treasuries were built at Delphi by the Cycladic Siphnians and Knidians, as well as by the 1429 IG I3 453-460. 1430 Philochoros, in scholia Aristophanes, Pax, 605-06. 1431 IG I3 436-450. 1432 Strabo, Geogr. 9.1.12.</page><page sequence="589">574 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Massalians, colonized by the Phokaians in about 600 BC. There are signs of Ionic influence at Athens under the Peisistratids in the unattributed continuous frieze fragments found on the Akropolis, which date from the late 6th century BC.1433 The same influence can be seen in the size and plan of the temple of Olympian Zeus, started around 520 BC. It measured 41.1m by 107.75m and it had eight by twenty columns, with a double pteron plus a third row of columns across each end. In the period following the Persian Wars the Athenians built both mixed Doric-Ionic buildings and even a purely Ionic stoa. The older Parthenon, which was never completed, had Ionic antae and an Ionic base moulding around the antae which continued along the walls of the naos, while the Stoa Poikile of the 460s BC incorporated an outer colonnade of the Doric order and an inner colonnade of the Ionic order. That the growing use of Ionic by Athenians was more than an aesthetic development and that it also carried conscious political overtones is suggested by the purely Ionic Stoa of the Athenians at Delphi. For the stoa was built to commemorate the joint Athenian- Ionian victory against the Persians at Mykale in 478 BC. After the Persian Wars, and increasingly so under Perikles's influence, the basis of Athens's increasing political power and wealth resided in the home of the Ionic Order - Asia Minor and the Cyclades. A blending of the Orders in Attic architecture expressed well the city's ties both with her Dorian neighbours on the mainland and her Ionian compatriots in Asia Minor. One of the most striking and unusual aspects of the design of the Parthenon is its extensive use of Ionic features. Ionic elements include the sculptured Ionic egg and dart mouldings, the Lesbian cymas of the ceiling beams and the cornices, the Ionic volutes and anthemia on the leading cover tiles, the beaded astragal carved all round the building above the Doric frieze and, most remarkable of all, the continuous relief frieze around the outside of the naos. Although no archaeological evidence has yet been found to confirm the idea, it is possible that the tall, slender columns of the Parthenon west chamber had Ionic capitals. Pedersen has argued for Corinthian capitals in this chamber, but this hypothesis seems unlikely given the fact that the Parthenon had an enormous influence on contemporary architecture and sculpture and that there are no examples of Corinthian capitals in Athens until considerably later.1434 Cycladic influence can be seen in the extensive use of marble for almost every part of the building, including the ceilings of the porches and pteromata. Even the Doric forms of the building are imbued with Ionic influence. The octastyle façade of the exterior of the temple is reminiscent of the enormous Ionic octastyle temples and, like these, the Parthenon achieves - due to altered proportions - a comparably large interior space, even though its overall dimensions are considerably smaller. The proportions of the hexastyle façade of the naos show a similar influence: slender columns are matched with delicately proportioned stylobate steps and architrave. 1433 For this work see Boardman (1979) fig. 200. 1434 Pedersen (1989).</page><page sequence="590">PARTHENON 575 1.3. THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE TEMPLE SCULPTURES The surviving epigraphical evidence for the Parthenon provides much information concerning the date of its construction and makes it one of the most securely dated temples of the period. The building accounts, which were recorded on a stele that was kept on the Akropolis, run for fifteen years.1435 Year 14 can be dated to 434/433 BC by the name of the archon given for that year. Therefore, Year 1 is 447/446 BC and Year 15 is 433/432 BC. But, as Corbett points out, one cannot be sure that Years 1 and 15 mark the exact beginning and end of all work on the Parthenon.1436 The broad faces of the stele carry three double columns each for Years 1-13, while Years 14 and 15 appear on the two narrow faces. Since Years 14 and 15 do not fill these faces, there would have been room for at least one other list of accounts if needed and this may not have survived. It is doubtful whether work would have continued much after the outbreak of war, so if there was an extra year or so of work one would expect to find that it was carried out before Year 1 of the surviving accounts. Year 1 contains entries for quarrying and transporting marble from Mount Penteie to the Akropolis but perhaps, before this was done, preliminary work - such as clearing the site of débris, sorting out which blocks from the older Parthenon could be reused and building enlarged foundations for the new temple - had already been carried out. This idea is not contradicted by the evidence of the Strasbourg Papyrus, which suggests that Perikles's proposal to use tribute funds to build the Parthenon was made as early as 450/449 BC. If this is correct, then it seems likely that work started on the Parthenon shortly after the proposal was approved by the people. How much weight can be attached to the Strasbourg document is not certain, however, and it remains possible that Perikles's proposal dates from a little later than the year indicated. Even though there is precious little information that can be gleaned about them from the accounts, the temple sculptures can be dated fairly closely.1437 For constructional reasons, it is safe to assume that the metopes, which were carved before they were set in place, were the first of the sculptures to be completed (Figs. 21.1.1 and 21. 1.3-14). 1438 The terminus ante quem for the metopes is 438 BC, the year in which the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos was dedicated.1439 By that time the building must have been structurally complete and both weather- and thief-proof. How long before that date the ninety-two metopes were completed cannot be ascertained. They may have been finished by 442 BC, if Dinsmoor is correct to interpret the reference to purchases of wood in 444/443 BC and 442/441 BC as an indication that the roof was being built.1440 The metopes measure 1.2m 1435 IG I3 436-451. 1436 Corbett (1950) 1. 1437 Sparkes (1999) 5-7 draws attention to the speed with which the building was finished, a point made by Plutarch, Per. 13. He wonders how early other artists, in particular vase-painters, were given access to the sculptures of the Parthenon, or possibly their 'blueprints', and whether this may have been before the building was completed. 1438 See Ridgway (1981) 16-17.

Work on the pediments (Figs. 21.3.1-15) can also be dated quite closely: the earliest surviving records of payments made for stone for the pedimental figures and for the sculptors' wages date from Year 10 (438/437 BC) - though there may have been some earlier such entries which have not survived - and the latest records occur in Year 15 (433/432 BC). It is the mention of the pedimental sculptures which confirms that this set of accounts concerns the building of the Parthenon. The frieze (Figs. 21.2.1-35) is more difficult to date exactly: there are no direct references to it in the accounts and, as long as the frieze blocks were in place by 438 BC, by which time the roof was complete, there is no reason, in theory, why the frieze could not have been carved in situ rather than on the ground. If this is the case then the frieze could date from any time within the approximately fifteen year period within which work on the Parthenon was being carried out. A striking feature of the west frieze, which makes it different from the other three sides, is that each block is a self-contained unit with hardly any overlapping of figures from one block to the next. This fact has suggested that the west frieze, perhaps the first side to be made, was carved on the ground while the other three sides were carved in situ , so that the complicated pattern of overlapping figures - in particular on the north and south sides - could be achieved exactly. On the other hand, it may be argued that the compositional differences between the west frieze and the other three sides indicate no more than that the blocks of the west frieze alone did not have to be set side by side during carving. It should also be observed that, to a large extent, the east frieze shares with the west frieze the characteristic of minimal overlapping from one block to another and, as argued below, this feature may be attributable to intentional design rather than how and when the work was executed. On the basis that the metopes were made in the first years of the work and the pedimental figures in the later years, Brommer estimates that the frieze was probably made in the period in between, with some overlap on each side.1441 He is also of the opinion that the frieze was finished in time for the dedication of the statue of Athena, thus arriving at a period of around 445-438 BC for the making of the frieze. Childs too states that to date the frieze after 438 BC goes against the evidence of the building accounts.1442 He points out that in 438/437 BC (Year 10) surplus wood was sold off, an indication, he thinks, that the roof was finished and that scaffolding was being removed.1443 Year 9 has references to the purchasing of ivory, wages to goldsmiths and work in silver, suggesting that by this stage, apart from the pedimental groups, the work lacked only its finishing touches.1444 Since payments to sculptors of the pediments are carefully recorded from 438/437 BC, it is perhaps odd to find no such records of payments to sculptors of the frieze. Many of the yearly accounts are very fragmentary, and it is possible that the information appeared in the now missing sections of the accounts. But Year 10 (438/437 BC) survives quite well and since there is no entry in that year for payments to frieze sculptors, Childs regards it as almost certain that the frieze was finished by that date. Arguing on stylistic grounds Jenkins, on the other hand, 1441 Brommer (1977) 171-72. 1442 Childs (1985) 209-10. 1443 IG I3 445, line 298. 1444/GI3 444.</page><page sequence="592">PARTHENON 577 prefers to think that the frieze was probably made at the same time as the pediments, after the building was completed and at a time when "the sculptors could work from their scaffolding unhindered."1445 This view seems to find support in the architectural evidence gathered by Korres, suggesting that the continuous frieze was not part of the original plan for the building but an idea that was added when construction was already well under way and after the east front was built.1446 He has observed that, while the east side has narrow blocks backing the peristyle frieze, the other three sides were given much wider backers with adequate room to fit a crowning moulding similar to the one set over the sculptured frieze. Korres believes that the original temple plan included only carved metopes over the porches and pedimental sculptures, and that it was mainly due to the excessive funds available that the decisions were made first, to increase the number of metopes and place them on the exterior of the building and, second, to add an Ionic frieze. That the metopes were executed first accords well with their style and technical qualities, as compared with those of the other sculptural groups of the temple. The metopes are not only less advanced in style and design than the frieze and pedimental groups, they are also much more variable in their quality. This could plausibly be explained by the fact that they were the earliest works produced in the project when the sculptors had not yet worked together long enough to develop the homogeneous and distinctive Parthenon style, with its seemingly effortless and naturalistic rendering of the human form, its brilliant mastery of illusionistic drapery, both to complement figure stance and to communicate movement, and its use of pose rather than facial expression on the idealizing heads to convey mood. Many of the metopes survive only in a very fragmentary state and the best preserved series is the Centauromachy of the south side.1447 At their best, the metopes display some brilliant compositional schemes, some fine workmanship, pleasing effects with drapery, and bodily forms which show a good understanding of anatomy. This may be illustrated with, for instance, S.27 and S.28 (Figs. 21.1.9-10). The tension between the two figures in S.27, pulling in opposite directions, is strong, and there is an effective contrast made between the naked bodies and the folds of the Lapith's cloak as it hangs from his shoulders like a backdrop. In this metope, as in S.28, the bodily forms are well modelled and they aptly express both vigorous action and acute physical pain. The figures are much more sharply modelled, much less simplified than those seen in the sculptures of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Another good example is N.32, where there is an effective use of drapery as a backdrop for the figure of Athena. But some of the metopes are uninspired compositions and they are poorly executed. S.10 1445 Jenkins (1994) 19. 1446 Korres (1994c) 92-108. 1447 The Centauromachy theme occupies at least twenty-three of the thirty-two metopes on the south side, but the interpretation of the nine central metopes is not certain. These works, along with six others set on either side, are known primarily from Carrey's drawings, made some thirteen years before the explosion that wrecked the Parthenon in 1687. Although invaluable in preserving much information about the sculptures which would otherwise be completely lost, Carrey's drawings are not entirely reliable, particularly with regard to the objects held in the hands of figures. Newly assigned fragments of sculpture are gradually making the central metopes more intelligible but, whether their theme can be connected to the outer Centauromachy or whether they deal with a completely different subject, is yet to be ascertained. See Mantis (1997) 67ff.</page><page sequence="593">578 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS and S.29 are particularly awkward and unsuccessful, and in S.9 much reworking combined with drill holes on the heads indicate that the hair had to be attached separately, presumably because the sculptor made a mess of these heads. While all the Centaur metopes show the same, new and convincing solution to the problem of attaching the equine body to the human torso, there is no such agreement about how to render heads. Some of the Centaurs are shown as hideous monsters, S.7, S.9, S.26 (Figs. 21.1.6-7), sometimes with masklike faces, S.2, S.31 (Figs. 21.1.3 and 14). But others seem quite civilized and almost human, S.4, S.30 (Figs. 21.1.5 and 21.1.13), even if in some cases, such as S.29, their features are heavy and unrefined (Fig. 21.1.12). The frieze differs from the metopes in that it achieves strong artistic unity, apparently through the adherence of its artists to strictly imposed rules concerning technique, style and design. The difficult technique employed is that of low-relief, with as many as eight overlapping figures successfully rendered in a depth of never more than three inches at the top of the relief and much less at the base. Different hands were clearly at work, as can be observed from the way in which details are treated: take, for instance, the flying horses' manes on south frieze slab XI (Fig. 21.2.21) and compare them with the much more feathery effect achieved on the horses' manes on south frieze slab XXXI (Fig. 21. 2.24). 1448 The thick, bunched hairs of the mane on west frieze slab VIII (Fig. 21.2.14) show a completely different approach again. There is variation in the treatment of human faces, as can be seen from a comparison between S.IX.25 and his neighbour S.X.26 (Fig. 21.2.20), as well as in the treatment of drapery: S.VI.16 has completely different folds on his tunic to S.VII.17. But, despite such variations, it is clear that the sculptors who worked on the frieze were following a very detailed and carefully thought-out master plan, which aimed at maintaining a uniform approach throughout the work. And indeed, to take but one aspect, the fact that many of the faces on the frieze resemble each other so closely shows that the artists involved were successfully trained to master the new style. The design of the frieze too speaks for a master plan and indicates that individual artists were allowed much less freedom than might have been possible on, say, the metopes. This is manifest both from the careful regulation of the number of figures involved, and from the way in which the ebb and flow of movement and interest is constantly kept up through the clever alternation of stationary figures and active figures or groups, calm and excited animals, men looking ahead of them and men turning back to see what is going on behind them.1449 As noted earlier, on the west side and, to a large extent, on the east side, the composition carefully respects the divisions of the frieze blocks. This stands in strong contrast to the composition of the longer sides of the frieze, where the procession is allowed to progress without any such restraint. The effect achieved is surely deliberate: over the porches the Ionic frieze is strongly influenced by the Doric rhythm of metopes and triglyphs - the arrangement one would expect to find in this position in a normal Doric temple. 1448 All references to frieze figure numbers follow Jenkins (1994). 1449 complexity of the frieze is well brought out in Bird, Jenkins and Levi (1998). See also Neils (2005b) 215 who comments upon the innovative depiction of depth in the serried ranks of horses in the cavalcade "spread out like a hand of cards". Despite the close parallels between the north and south sides of the frieze, Neils also notes a striking difference in design between the two sides suggesting that two designers were at work, the more innovative on the north side.</page><page sequence="594">PARTHENON 579 Like the frieze, the pedimental sculptures too are clearly the product of an excellent design combined with first-rate execution. Although hampered by the constraints of the triangular pedimental frames, as sculptures in the round these works seem better suited to the full expression of the Classical style, with its understanding of the use of space. Their compositional groupings, as well as the way in which they relate to the colonnades beneath them, were obviously carefully thought out in advance. The central actions of each pediment are quite different: the west side showed the duel between Athena and Poseidon, the east side showed Athena fully grown standing by her father Zeus. But both events are dramatic, and this is wonderfully expressed in the movements of all the other figures in the groups, who show a wave of reaction which gradually dies out the further the figures are from the explosive drama at the centre of the composition. The pedimental sculptures do not achieve the same level of stylistic unity as the frieze. On the pediments there seems to have been more scope for experimentation, particularly in the rendering of drapery, as well as for individual differences of manner. A comparison of, for instance, figure C on the west pediment and figure G on the east pediment shows how different the treatment of drapery can be (Figs. 21.3.1 1 and 21.3.7). Perhaps this is due to the fact that although the general design of each sculpture was carefully worked out in advance, so that the whole composition fitted together as a group, different masters were responsible for one or more figures and they interpreted the design in different ways. 1.4. THE ROLE OF PHEIDIAS IN THE CREATION OF THE PARTHENON From the sources it is abundantly clear that the creation of the great chryselephantine image of Athena was the work of Pheidias. But none of the sources suggest that he had anything to do with the Parthenon, none of them, that is, except Plutarch. In a famous and controversial passage, Per. 13, Plutarch depicts Perikles as the mighty ruler of Athens and Pheidias as his chief supervisor for the building programme, directing all the work and overseeing the artists and workmen. Plutarch goes on to say that Pheidias was given this role because of his friendship with Perikles, and that it was partly as a result of his favoured treatment by the great politician that people grew jealous of Pheidias and eventually brought him to trial. From what one can gather about the system of control and accountability for public works in democratic Athens, it seems certain that Plutarch's picture of the situation is anachronistic. The terms he employs - ôiêîTe and émcrKOTTOç - are not technical terms and, as Himmelmann has argued, there was no place for an official supervisor who was independent of the board of elected epistatai for any given project.1450 Ameling is probably correct to suggest that Plutarch magnified the roles of both Perikles and Pheidias on the contemporary model of Trajan and his architect Apollodorus.1451 Even Plutarch admits that the various projects were executed by different architects and artists and, in agreement with other sources, Plutarch states that the one work executed by Pheidias was the Athena Parthenos. Concerning the Parthenon, he says that it was 1450 Himmelmann (1977) 67-90. 1451 Ameling (1985) 57.</page><page sequence="595">580 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS designed by the architects Iktinos and Kallikrates. Although not mentioned in this role in other sources, Kallikrates was a well-known Athenian architect of the period and it is possible that he did help with the Parthenon. But Iktinos is named as architect of this temple by both Strabo, Geogr. 9.1.12, and Pausanias, VIII.41.9; and Vitruvius, De Arch. l,praef. 12, states that Iktinos wrote a book about the Parthenon. The democratic system of public management, outlined above, makes it clear that Plutarch is exaggerating the role of Pheidias as chief overseer of the entire building programme. But even going so far as to say that he was in charge of the Parthenon sculptures is fraught with difficulties. Accepting that many hands were at work on the temple sculptures, as has been discussed briefly above, and that, as shown from the fact that the accounts for each were handled separately, the temple sculptures and the statue of Athena were separate projects, the chronology of events is such that it was impossible for Pheidias to oversee the whole of the Parthenon project. For while the Parthenon pediments were being carved, if nothing else, Pheidias was surely in Olympia creating the great chryselephantine Zeus. A close look at the sculptures of the Parthenon suggests that they were produced from a design which was planned well before the sculptures were made. As far as one can judge from the battered remains, the metopes have the least intricate design. Although some of the compositions are exciting and bold, many of the metopes seem to have been composed as individual works, illustrating different episodes or scenes within a story, with little regard for the overall pattern. The series on the west side seems dominated by a very simple compositional scheme: duelling pairs alternate with an Amazon on horseback and a Greek on the ground. On the east side, a more complex pattern seems to be emerging, with various interrelations existing between the metopes: the two triads are placed fourth in from either end of the series while neighbouring metopes feature closely related pairs of deities, Hera and Zeus taking central positions.1452 The frieze and the pediments, on the other hand, show very careful and elaborate planning which suggests that they cannot have been made without very detailed and well thought out designs, produced some time before any carving could be attempted. Furthermore, it seems unthinkable that the temple sculptures and its statue could have been planned and designed independently. The many cross-references between the two works and their interrelation makes this difficult to believe. As discussed in section 7 of the chapter on the Athena Parthenos, there is a striking thematic coordination between the temple sculptures and the statue. Firstly, there is the noticeable repetition on the temple and its statue of certain mythological themes: the Gigantomachy is the subject of both the east metopes and the shield interior, the Amazonomachy that of the west metopes and the shield exterior, while the Centauromachy is the subject of both the south metopes and the sandal edges of the Parthenos. Secondly, there is the repetition on temple and statue of the famous framing motif of Sun and Moon: first seen on the east pediment of the temple, probably repeated on the north metopes - though these are very damaged and difficult to read - the theme next reappears on the base of the statue. Thirdly, even where themes differ, one finds obvious parallels between the temple sculptures and the statue: the creation of Athena on the east pediment is paralleled in the creation of Pandora on the statue base; the dressing of Pandora recalls the subject of the frieze, at the centre of which is the peplos scene; assemblies of gods recur on the east pediment, the frieze and the statue 1452 See Schwab (1996) 8 Iff.</page><page sequence="596">PARTHENON 581 base. Such cross-referencing between temple sculptures and temple statue and the deliberate repetition of themes and motifs suggests that all the sculptures were planned together, to be read as one complex work. Although Pheidias alone need not have been responsible for choosing all the themes that were to be depicted, nevertheless as master sculptor for the statue of Athena he was surely involved in the discussions concerning thematic composition and interconnection. Some of the subjects chosen for the sculptures of the Parthenon were very unusual. Since a number of them are known to have recurred in other works by Pheidias, it is possible that they were created by him. One example is the famous framing motif of Helios and Selene. In sculpture, this motif seems to have been used in only two places: the Parthenon and the statue base of Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia, made in the 430s BC. The Athena Parthenos is the first known example in sculpture of an Athena Nikephoros. The close connection with Nike is found again in east metope 4, where Nike is seen hovering behind Athena as she fights a giant. The introduction of Nike into a Gigantomachy scene is unprecedented in earlier sculpture or vase-painting. Palagia tentatively suggests that Nike may also have appeared near Athena in the central part of the east pediment.1453 An important work of art which predated the Parthenon and which may have influenced the Parthenon frieze, is the painting of the Battle of Marathon which adorned the Stoa Poikile in Athens and which was probably by Pheidias's relative, Panainos. Pheidias's familiarity with contemporary painting, the report that he may have started his career as a painter, and his collaboration with Panainos on other projects, suggest that he knew the Marathon painting well. In parallel with this work, Pheidias's Marathon Monument at Delphi incorporates gods, heroes and humans in a striking and unusual manner. The works were roughly contemporary but their relative dating is not known. Boardman suggested that the Parthenon frieze might be interpreted as a memorial to the dead of Marathon, and that, as well as gods and mortals, this work too included heroes: Boardman identified as the Eponymous Heroes the ten male figures of the east frieze, six to the left of the gods and four to the right.1454 This interpretation has not been accepted by all. Nevertheless, one might note that a link between the Marathon painting and the Parthenon frieze may have been established by Neils, if she is correct in her interpretation of the frieze. Just as the Marathon painting depicted the unfolding of events, rather than one specific moment in time, so too the frieze should be read, she believes, as "a time-space continuum high- lighting specific moments of an event that took place over an expanse of distance and time".1455 Neils regards the cavalcade, which occupies almost half the work, as "time now", with figures W.XII.23 and E.VI.47, who share the same, unusual pose, marking the beginning and end of the procession proper, while the southern third of the west frieze depicts preparations for the cavalcade, "time before", and the east frieze shows us the refolding of the peplos at the end of the ceremony when it has been accepted by the goddess, "time after". A compositional feature which inspires both the frieze and the pediments of the Parthenon is the device of having neighbouring figures illustrate different stages of 1453 Palagia (1993) 30. 1454 Boardman (1977) 39ff. Concerning the Stoa Poikile, see Pausanias, 1.15.3.

In this way movement can be expressed and the stones come to life. On the frieze, a good example is the arm positions of the seated gods in the right hand group of the east frieze: the right arm falls to the side of Poseidon; it is bent at the elbow, with the hand holding drapery folds at the waist of Apollo; it rises to the shoulder of Artemis, again to hold drapery, and then drops back in Aphrodite's case so that her forearm rests casually on the left knee of Artemis. Similarly, the left arm movements of Poseidon, Apollo and Aphrodite follow a natural sequence, gradually rising and straightening into the pointing movement of Aphrodite. The one multi-figure composition by Pheidias that is known to us in some detail is the shield of the Athena Parthenos. In this case figures are not set in a linear arrangement, but rather they move in small groups disposed in a circle around the central gorgoneion. Again the device of showing figures in different but closely related poses is used to impart a feeling of movement. Take, for example, the two spear- throwing Amazons in the group of three fighters occupying the central space on the right side of the shield: although seen from a slightly different angle, they share very similar poses, yet the arms are held at different angles and the lower Amazon's left leg is more extended. One might also compare the Greek youth these Amazons are attacking with the man below him, the Greek in the hair pulling group. The Greek in the group of three is on the defensive, crouching nervously behind his shield, with his right arm drawn in, his right leg set very straight as he steadies himself in his position, and his head peeping over the top of the shield in anticipation of the attack. Below him, we see a Greek holding the advantage over his adversary. Now the pose is much more open: the left arm stretches out gripping the Amazon's head, the right arm and dagger are lowered and drawn back, ready to lunge forwards with strength, and both legs are strongly inclined as the whole body stretches forward. All the sources agree that the shield of the Athena Parthenos was the work of Pheidias. Since the shield is the one work by Pheidias which can be restored with some confidence and since it illustrates many different figure types and poses, both draped and undraped, as well as an interesting use of landscape elements, it seems appropriate to compare this work with the Parthenon sculptures and see how closely related the two are stylistically. In the sections that follow aspects of the Parthenon sculptures will be analyzed and compared with corresponding features on the shield.</page><page sequence="598">2. DRAPERY Amongst the most brilliant features of the Parthenon sculptures is the depiction of drapery. In the space of merely fifteen years a completely new and distinctive approach to drapery was developed, one which was very influential on the later course of Greek sculpture, particularly in Attica, and which put the Parthenon at the forefront of sculptural advance. The primary motivation for this development seems to have been the desire to model as fully as possible the female form without breaking the convention of always having draped females. Although they succeeded in creating the illusion of realistic drapery, the sculptors were in fact using an artificial system of folds, in which the folds were completely subordinate to the human shape. Used for pictorial effect, and illusionistic in style, drapery became a means of both setting off and articulating the human form, of complementing figure stance and of suggesting movement. Although some of the ideas that were used, such as illusionary transparency and catenary folds, can be traced back to well before the time of the Parthenon, it is in the sculptures of this building that they are first applied in a new and successful manner. Their development was in part dependent upon a mastery of human anatomy and these two aspects of Greek sculpture had to advance side by side. That new techniques and a new style were being developed in the sculptures of the Parthenon is clear from the amount of variation and experimentation which can be observed in their handling. Not all the sculptors were equal to the task and it seems probable that of the large number of sculptors hired to make the ninety-two metopes, only the best were kept on to work on the frieze and pediments. Various approaches are taken to the rendering of drapery, with different techniques serving different purposes, some of them more suited to relief carving, others more suited to sculpture in the round. Following Rhys Carpenter's analysis, one can distinguish five main techniques: the modelling line; transparency; catenary lines; motion lines; and ribbon drapery.1456 From what can be gathered about the shield from later copies, it seems that some, though perhaps not all, of the methods used on the Parthenon sculptures were also known to the shield master, even though he was working in a different material. The modelling line, which essentially gives depth to a figure by creating a system of shadows and highlights, was used to articulate the human form and make a pose more intelligible. It consists of ridges and grooves in the drapery which follow the exact shape of the body that the drapery covers. This technique was still not fully understood at the time when the pedimental sculptures for the temple of Zeus at Olympia were being made. But on the Parthenon pediments it was used to wonderful effect. The most striking example of its use occurs in the seated goddesses of the east pediment, where the shape of the figures is suggestively revealed through the complicated pattern of folds in their drapery (Fig. 21.3.8). The folds pass over the thigh into the lap, over the next thigh, round the back and so on, in long, unbroken sequences which clarify the human shape. 1456 Carpenter (1960) 109-51. 583</page><page sequence="599">584 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS As a technique for suggesting depth, the modelling line was best suited to sculpture in the round. On the very high relief of the metopes it could well have been put to effective use too in some of the compositions, although this is difficult to tell from the surviving examples. The best preserved series is predominantly concerned with nude figures and although there are a few good examples, as for instance, the left arm of the Centaur, which is draped in a panther skin, in S.28, and the legs of the seated goddess in N.32, more often drapery on the body did little to enhance the shape beneath, and its depiction is more akin to the sculptures of Olympia than anything elsewhere on the Parthenon. Take, for instance, the thick and complicated folds on the upper part of the seated goddess in N.32, and the early Classical appearance of the Athena standing before her. The falling drapery of the Lapith woman in S.12 shows a complete lack of understanding about how to use drapery to clarify figure and pose. The folds over the trunk of the Lapith woman in S.10 show a clearer idea of what was intended, but the execution here is poor and the effect lacks any charm or subtlety. It appears that the use of the modelling line had not yet been fully mastered at the time when the metopes were being carved. According to the Greeks, high relief and sculpture in the round benefited from brilliant light and the accompanying deep shadows created by the sculptures themselves. They were, therefore, used to adorn the exterior of temples. The use of strong modelling lines would have been enhanced by the play of light and shadow on the contours of these works. Low relief, on the other hand, was considered better suited to a more dimly lit position, where strong shadows could not obscure the design. Without attempting to reflect the true depth of the model, it gives only a token depth, sufficient to transform the figure from the pictorial representation out of which it was created to a fully sculptural and solid form. On the Parthenon frieze carving depth was kept to a minimum. Within this scheme, a growing awareness of the use of the modelling line made it an important tool in the realistic depiction of the human form. The subject of the frieze dictated the need for draped men as well as women, and a rich variety of costumes is shown. Although the modelling line was still not fully used on the frieze (as witness, for instance, the torso of the horseman, N.XLVI.131), many successful applications can be seen in this work. The seated gods of the east frieze are successfully modelled through their drapery; unlike the seated goddess of N.32 metope, the fabric of their apparel is shown to be thin enough for the technique to work. Even the thicker fabric of a himation on, for instance, N.II.4 effectively models the human frame it enfolds. The bunched folds around the trunks of the bearded men on either side of the gods enhance their form as well as their pose. On N.XV.51, modelling lines are effectively used to cope with the strong foreshortening involved in the position of the left arm. The numerous thin folds of the tunics of several foot soldiers are used to shape the upper part of the leg, as can be seen on N.XII.47 (Fig. 21.2.30) or N.XXVII.71. The only part of the body which is never modelled through drapery seems to be the knee of the supporting leg of a figure in the Attic stance. See the girls in procession on the east frieze, for example. Along with a full understanding of the use of the modelling line came the first successful attempts to depict illusionary transparency: over an extended smooth surface thin running ridges showed that drapery rather than skin was being displayed. This impression would have been reinforced in the original works by the application of brightly coloured paint. Archaic sculptors had tried to show transparent drapery, but the incised grooves with which they depicted it remained unrealistic and mannered. The new technique became very popular during the last three decades of the 5th century BC. But it was never</page><page sequence="600">PARTHENON 585 very common on bronzes, it seems, probably because it was not so well suited to that medium. On the metopes, the technique is not much used, though it is attempted occasionally. Examples include the right leg of the Lapith woman in the ugly metope S.10 and the legs of the Lapith woman in the equally ungainly metope S.29 (Fig. 21.1.11). In S.10 the design is noticeably superior to the execution: the designer intended a striking contrast to be achieved between the thinly draped trailing right leg and the completely bare left leg boldly stepping forward in escape. The left leg is set against the strong folds of the dress flying open on either side. On the frieze illusionary transparency is used much more confidently and much more freely. It is apparent in the torsos of the female goddesses and some of the female mortals on the east frieze, where drapery folds are interrupted over the breast (figs. 21.2.1-3). Good examples are the figures of Hera, Athena and Artemis. The knees and lower legs of these and other seated figures are also treated in this manner. The relaxed leg of a standing pose can be articulated by means of transparent drapery: see, for instance, the marshals on east frieze slabs VI and VII, figures 47, 48, 49 and 52 as well as some of the bearded men leaning on their sticks. Transparency is used on the tunics of some of the horsemen, revealing the whole length of a thigh on W.II.3 and N.XXXV.93. And on north frieze slab VI, the first water-jar carrier contrasts with his neighbour in that while the second figure has a bare torso, the first wears his himation much higher, but nevertheless his contours are well rendered through the taut cloth (Fig. 21.2.26). It is on the temple pediments that transparent drapery is used in the most effective and memorable way. A good number of female figures is preserved and much of their sensuousness comes from their revealing attire, which clings to the form as closely as if it were wet. The use of transparent drapery on the pediments goes beyond anything that can be found in the temple reliefs. The most advanced figures on the east pediment are K, L and M (Fig. 21.3.8) . The drapery and physical form of each of these figures are in perfect harmony. On the west pediment, the most brilliant display of drapery is perhaps that of figure N, where a more advanced technique is employed, with flat folds "practically scarring the surface of her naked body" (Fig.21.3.13).1457 This technique is not absorbed into Greek sculpture until around the turn of the century. Figures B and C of the west pediment are very weathered, but what remains of the surface shows the virtuosity with which the different textures of peplos and mantle could be handled (Fig.2 1.3.1 1). A third technique that is used very beautifully on the Parthenon reliefs, though apparently not on the pediments, is the catenary line: bunches or chains of loose folds, suspended between salient points, are used either to provide an interesting pattern of drapery against which to contrast the human form or to add stability to a pose, without trying to reveal the bodily form behind the cloth. One of the most striking examples of this technique is the brilliant display on the metope S.27 (Fig. 21.1.9). The thick, shadowy folds of the himation hanging down from the outstretched arms of the Lapith contrast superbly with this man's tense naked figure. The technique of using catenaries as a backdrop for the human form can also be found on the frieze, though here it is used in a less ostentatious manner. Catenary folds may be seen on the cloak of W.VI.12 (Fig. 21.2.13), for example, or the himation on Aphrodite's chair, E.VI.41. But more often on the frieze it is used simply to unify a pattern of drapery on the human figure, without 1457 Palagia (1993) 49.</page><page sequence="601">586 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS trying to model the figure at the same time. There is, for instance, the rather strange effect produced on the torso of S.XIX.50, and the effect, often repeated, of catenaries on the thigh of the horseman, S.XXIII.59 (Fig. 21.2.23). Catenaries which override the modelled form beneath the cloth can be seen on the lower legs of Athena in the east frieze (E.V.36). A similar, but more realistic, arrangement of folds is that shown on the lower legs of Athena's neighbour Hephaistos, where the catenaries stretch between his two knees (E.V.37). From these examples it is clear that the catenary line remained an essentially two-dimensional technique at this period. Hence the fact that it was not exploited by the pediment masters. The use of motion lines and the depiction of flying dress is yet another important technique which was developed during the period when the Parthenon was being built. Drapery folds apparently disturbed by the movement of a figure were seen to add to the illusion of movement in that figure. Given an ogival swing, motion lines for the first time acquired a lively appearance which could be used both for drapery that was shown clinging to the body as well as for drapery shown billowing out, in deeper folds, as it left the body. Archaic and early Classical sculptors clearly laid the ground for such a development, but they never succeeded in harnessing the motion line in the way the Parthenon masters did. The portrayal of movement was attempted in the straight but diagonally set folds of the himation that stick out from the body and the fan-shaped pleats between the legs of the Nike of Kallimachos, dating from about 490-480 BC.1458 A windswept look was also attempted in the more ogival form of the folds, combined with clinging drapery on the shins, of the running girl from Eleusis, in the local museum, of around 490 BC. But, even on this interesting, but rather untypical, example, the depiction of movement in the upper part of the figure is restricted to the disturbance of folds from the vertical to the diagonal, in straight, and rather dead lines. Less successful is the rendering of movement on the Nike akroterion from the temple of Apollo in Delphi, where closely set, parallel drapery folds are shown falling in a slightly curved fashion. Even on the Nike from Paros, dating from around 470-460 BC, the effect on the drapery of the figure's movement is limited to clinging folds on the legs and a slight disturbance away from the vertical of folds on the torso.1459 On the Parthenon metopes, the decorative effect of drapery flying free of the body was well understood by a few, though by no means all, of the sculptors. There are some excellent examples of energetic movement created by the depiction of strong, curving folds in the cloaks on metopes S.3 and S.7 (Figs. 21.1.4 and 6). The pattern of the animal skin flying behind the Centaur on S.5 must also have done much to enhance the composition of this sculpture. More often than not, however, flying drapery was still depicted in rather straight, lifeless lines as one can see from, for instance, W.l, W.ll, E.6 and S.29 (Fig. 21.1.1). From the surviving metopes it seems that the successful rendering of motion lines clinging to the body was still a problem too. The clinging folds on the legs of the Lapith woman in S.29 (Fig. 21.1.11) suggest windblown drapery but, as they fall away from the legs, they are straight and they lack coordination with the dress folds between the legs. The folds in the upper part of the figure show no disturbance at all. On the west metopes there 1458 Athens, Akropolis Museum, 690, Boardmam (1978) fig. 167. 1459 For the Eleusis girl and the Nikai of Delphi and Paros, see Boardman (1978) figs. 202 and 204, and (1979) fig. 27.</page><page sequence="602">PARTHENON 587 was probably some indication of movement in the tunics of the Amazons, but the sadly battered state of these sculptures makes it difficult to judge. A few disturbed lines, indicating past movement in the figure, are nevertheless preserved in the tunic skirt of the Amazon of W.14. Turning to the frieze, it is clear that motion lines were much better understood and harnessed by the time this work was made. Some of the force and vitality of the frieze can be attributed to the careful use of these lines, both on and off the human figure. A good example of a cloak flying in the wind in strong, deep folds can be seen on the S.XXXI.79 (Fig. 21.2.24). On the west frieze, several horsemen are given vitality by their flying cloaks or panther skins: consider W.II.2, W.IV.8, and W. VII. 14, and much of the restraining force of W. VIII. 15 comes from the cloak billowing out behind this man. Such flying drapery not only adds to the movement and life of the frieze, but also enhances its pictorial variety, and it was for both these qualities that the device became so popular on later friezes. Less dramatic, but also adding to the impression of movement are the repeated small, billowing folds in the tunics of horsemen and foot soldiers climbing into or already standing in moving chariots. The folds flying out behind N.XXVII.71 illustrate this technique. The movement is repeated on figures N.XVII.55 and N.XXIII.64 (Fig. 21.2.31) on the same side of the frieze. On some of these examples one can also observe the use of motion lines on and between the legs, before the drapery leaves the body. On N.XXVII.71 the folds are rendered as much shallower ridges and grooves than those used for drapery flying free of the body and this enabled the sculptor to use the drapery folds to continue the modelling of the leg beneath the tunic. The same technique can be observed on N.XII.47 (Fig. 21.2.30). This shows a skilful mastery of the use of motion lines, for quite often sculptors clearly found it difficult to apply them on the body without obscuring the bodily forms. In the case of the drapery on the legs of the charioteer, figure N.XII.46, the human form is lost under the overemphatic treatment of ogival motion lines. On the pediments the same sort of problem as that just described arises in figure G of the east pediment (Fig. 21.3.7). Again, overemphatic ogival motion lines obscure the bodily forms. The artist has tried to compensate for this by using illusionary transparency, but the overall effect appears somewhat experimental. The execution of the piece is not equal to the boldness of the design. Much more successful is figure N on the west pediment (Fig. 21.3.13). This time the goddess wears a short tunic in much thinner cloth than the peplos of figure G. The folds are, therefore, much shallower and they stay closer to the body. In this way the artist managed to combine his motion and modelling lines successfully. Sculpture Q on the west pediment illustrates a new development: the use of billowing drapery on a quietly seated figure, such as became usual in the rich style of the late 5th century BC and which may be associated with the style of Agorakritos.1460 A technique which was employed in an attempt to compromise between transparency and the use of modelling lines in drapery to reveal the human form is ribbon drapery. This mannerism, which shows folds as flat bands rather than ridges, is first found on the Parthenon and it continued to be used until the early 4th century BC, but it was never very popular, presumably because it was not entirely successful. Instead of revealing the bodily shape, ribbon drapery tends to smother it if overdone. For drapery folds are shown as a series of closely set, shallow ribbons completely covering a fully shaped form. An example from the pediments is figure C from the west side (Fig. 21.3.1 1). Ribbon drapery can also 1460 Palagia (1993) 49. Despinis (1971) 126-27.</page><page sequence="603">588 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS be seen on the back of figure N of the west side. The Lapith woman on south metope 29 (Fig. 21.1.11) shows a similar drapery pattern. On the frieze one can point to the charioteer, figure N.XXIII.64 (Fig. 21.2.31). In this last case ribbon drapery is used in a very limited way and this seems to be the case generally on the frieze. The Parthenon sculptors succeeded in making drapery folds look as natural and realistic as possible. Yet certain mannerisms can be picked out. One recurring feature is the forked fold. The Lapith on south metope 7 displays some on his left shoulder (Fig. 21.1.6). Frieze figure N.II.4 has a forked fold just below knee level. An example from the pediments occurs on the lower leg of east pediment K.1461 Figures 47 and 49 of east frieze, slabs VI (Fig. 21.2.4) and VII, exhibit bellying folds at the waist. There is also the double fold, consisting of one ridge divided in two by a thin groove cut down the middle. On south metope 6, three long and rather monotonous double folds adorn the left side of the Lapith's falling himation. On the east frieze much more discreet double folds are present on the upper thighs of Hera, Dionysos and Demeter. There are also double folds on fragments of peplos figure 'Wegner' from the east pediment.1462 More advanced folds, which seem to make their first appearance on the pediments, are eye folds. These are clearly visible on the himation covering the left lower leg of B on the west pediment, as well as on the right lower leg of K on the east pediment. The distinctive 'pie-crust' selvage of N.II.4 is repeated on many frieze figures and occurs also on the chlamys of the Centaur of south metope 29, for instance. On the pediments, selvages are clearly visible on, for instance, east pediment K and west pediment W. By defining the edge of a mantle, these lines help to articulate the cloth. Press folds in the cloth are occasionally indicated. Athena from the west pediment displays two such folds under her right breast. These may be compared with the folds on the right side of the skirt of the 'Wegner' figure from the east pediment, as well as those of the skirt of the oinochoe carrier on the frieze, E.III. 10. With regard to the representation of drapery, it seems to be the case that many of the ideas explored and developed in the Parthenon sculptures were present in the design from the beginning. Not all the sculptors working on the project had full mastery of the techniques involved, some of which were new and some of which are known to have been used in earlier works. Experiments were undertaken and, despite some mistakes, progress was made in handling the techniques. The contemporary and closely related work, the shield of the Athena Parthenos by Pheidias, which can be reconstructed fairly well from copies, deals with the Athenian Amazonomachy. Relief figures, probably rendered in gilded bronze, were applied to a background surface which was adorned with some sort of setting executed mostly in very low relief. The Amazons were shown wearing short tunics rather than Persian dress, while the Greeks were shown almost completely naked. Despite the warlike subject, drapery plays an important part in the composition and a comparison of the drapery forms on this work, such as they are known, and those of the Parthenon sculptures, reveals that some of the same preoccupations exercized both the shield and Parthenon masters. In this matter the Piraeus reliefs are an invaluable aid, for they are life-size copies of figure groups from the original work and, judging from their size and from the way copies of similar figures correspond, they were probably made from moulds taken directly from the original. The 1461 Palagia (1993) fig. 44. 1462 Delivorrias (1994) fig. 17.</page><page sequence="604">PARTHENON 589 quality of carving in these copies varies considerably and reflects later fashions, but drapery design at least seems to have been preserved quite well from the original reliefs. The smaller copies, which may help provide information about figure poses and the disposition of figures on the shield, are too abbreviated on the whole to be trusted with regard to details such as drapery styles. Copies of the shield figures show that drapery folds could be used successfully to bring out the human shape. The tunic on the right thigh of the Amazon attacking uphill illustrates this.1463 The almost pleated folds of the thin fabric have been disturbed by the way that the Amazon's right foot is raised as she steps on a rock and the resulting pattern of folds helps to model the leg beneath. Modelling lines can also be seen on the right thigh and left arm of the Greek archer (Fig. 6.54). 1464 Harrison draws attention to "the poetry of linear design" displayed, for example, on the torso of the Greek youth in the axe group, which she finds superior to the arrangement seen on W.XII.23 of the Parthenon frieze (Figs. 6.61 and 21.2. 15).1465 The two figures are quite similar, both wearing the same sort of thin, double-belted chiton. But what makes the shield figure more successful is the fact that his torso is completely modelled even though covered in drapery. The drapery of his colleague on the frieze, on the other hand, is much less subtly rendered, with thick folds masking the covered shape. The drapery folds on the shield copy cannot really be described as modelling lines, but clearly present is the idea of articulating bodily forms even when they are covered by drapery. The Amazon shown from back view, who is attacking a Greek archer, has a tunic belted at the waist. The strong pattern of folds which dominates the tunic is reminiscent both of the rather monotonous design of the back of east pediment N (Selene) and of the Varvakeion and Madrid statuettes which imitate the Athena Parthenos. Although the warlike subject does not particularly lend itself to the use of the device, illusionary transparency is found in several places on the shield. One example is the left breast of the Amazon in the hair-pulling group (Figs. 6.46 and 48). 1466 In this instance, the clinging drapery is used to reinforce the idea that the figure is moving. It also seems to have been used on the thighs of the Amazon in the 'pilos- wearer' group.1467 Catenary lines do not appear to have been used a great deal, but two copies of the Amazon in the archer group show catenaries in the lower part of this woman's tunic (Fig. 6.55). 1468 The device of showing movement in the swinging folds of a tunic as it flies out behind the wearer is repeated several times. The Amazon of the hair-pulling group again, the Amazon in the 'Kapaneus' group and the Amazon wielding an axe all illustrate this feature. The thin, closely set folds of the tunic over or in between the legs and the stronger folds 1463 Piraeus relief, no. 2117 etc. Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 12. 1464 Piraeus relief, nos. 2114 etc and 2117 etc. Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 7. 1465 Harrison (1996) 45.

Where cloaks are shown disturbed by the movement of the wearer, as in the cases of the Greek archer, the 'stone-thrower' and the Munich spearman, the drapery lines seem not to have been curved but rather to have been moved out of the vertical somewhat, towards the diagonal. The same seems to have been true for the cloak of the Greek helping his wounded companion. By the time the Parthenon frieze and pediments were being made such drapery folds were usually given a more curving line, but in earlier works, including some of the metopes, this approach is not surprising. Motion lines were still in an experimental stage, it seems, at this time. Ribbon drapery too makes its appearance in the copies of the Parthenos shield: on copies of the hair-pulling group, ribbon drapery is used for the Amazon's tunic, modelling her rib cage on the left side, as well as her abdomen and thighs. It is possible that the technique was used elsewhere too, as the Chiaramonti shield fragment suggests (Fig.6.34). Even some of the mannerisms of Parthenon drapery can be seen on some of the shield copies: there are forked folds on the chlamys of the archer as well as on the lower tunic of his Amazon adversary and, although this is not quite clear from photos, it is possible to see selvage edge lines on the chlamys of the Greek in the hair pulling group in the copy in Piraeus which also shows column tops (fig. 6.47). The repeated use of drapery to set off a nude is another technique that is frequently applied. It can be seen on the Munich Greek, 'Theseus', the dead Greek, the Greek in the hair pulling group, the Greek helper group, 'Kapaneus' and the 'stone-thrower'. Drapery patterns were used to form a contrast with bodily forms and smooth skin, thereby setting these off to best advantage. Such an approach is found time and again on the Parthenon sculptures.</page><page sequence="606">3. FIGURE TYPES 3.1. HEAD TYPES AND POSES The surviving heads from the metopes belong to the Lapith men and Centaurs of the south series. No others have survived. The Lapith men are shown as young and beardless, with a thick mass of hair on their heads, which is ill-defined (Fig. 21.1.14). Some wear bands round their heads (S.4), some have drill holes, showing where locks would have been added (S.9). There is considerable variation in the rendering of facial features and ears. Some, like those of S.7 and S.31, have very large features, with thick lips, heavy chins and big ears. Several, as for instance, on S.30, show expression in their furrowed brows and parted lips. In this respect they are more akin to the Lapiths of the temple of Zeus at Olympia than anything else on the Parthenon. The Lapith of S.6, on the other hand, has a finer face and he wears a look of complete calm, such as one would expect from the idealizing art of Classical Athens. When juxtaposed with a grimacing, monstrous Centaur (as in the case of S.7), such calmness helps to give the story a timeless quality, open to a more general interpretation as a struggle "between civilized and barbarian, good and evil", as Boardman says.1469 Many of the Centaurs are shown as ugly brutes, with long hair and beards, large, open mouths (S.2, fig. 21.1.3), and sometimes a furious, struggling expression (S.26, fig. 21.1.8). Even more so than amongst the Lapiths, however, there are great variations between the Centaur heads. While the Centaur of S.26 has very coarse features, S.31 (Fig. 21.1.14) is a caricature, with his waving pattern of locks, rounded cheek muscles, and a heavily accentuated single eyebrow. In contrast, a number of Centaurs fail to look in the least monstrous. The Centaur of S.4 has a handsome, middle-aged look with a quiet, idealizing expression. The elderly Centaur of S.29 (Fig. 21.1.12), who appears decidedly uncomfortable under the weight of his burden and has a look of dogged determination, can hardly be described as monstrous, although he has a wide nose. There is a slightly pained look on the gentle face of the Centaur of S.30 (Fig. 21.1.13). The large open mouth and the heavy eyebrows of the Centaur of S.9 tend towards the monstrous but, seen from side-view, this impression is considerably weakened. Turning to the Parthenon frieze one finds a much more consistent and unified approach to the depiction of heads, and the design is such that expression is not left to the faces, which are idealizing, but is conveyed through the pose of the whole body. Men and women, old and young, are shown on the frieze. In general they share the same round head with a deep cranium, small, round ears set far back, a compact face, often, though not always, with a fully rounded lower jaw and down-turned lips that give a rather sulky look.1470 The full, firm cheeks of youth contrast with those of older figures, which are leaner and through which the form of the cheek bone is clearly visible. The faces of 1469 Boardman (1985a) 105. Boardman includes numerous useful illustrations of the Parthenon head an figure types. 1470 See, for instance, N.XLIV. 123 (Fig. 21.2.35, figure on right). 591</page><page sequence="607">592 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Poseidon and Apollo, E.VI.38 and 39 (Fig. 21.2.5-7), show such a difference. Heads are depicted in many different positions, but a favourite scheme is the profile looking straight ahead. In these cases the viewer is often shown more than he would see naturally: sometimes eyes are shown at three-quarter view and the crown of the head can also be seen.1471 While the women of the east frieze have their hair carefully arranged either with a fillet and braids going down their backs (for example, E. VIII. 60, fig. 21.2.1 1) or tied up in a bun at the back (so Artemis, E.VI.40, fig. 21.2.8), the rendering of hair on the men is more varied: the bearded men on the east frieze, perhaps the eponymous heroes, have thick locks, that are carefully differentiated; W. VII. 14 and W.VIII.15 have windswept locks echoing their windswept garments; but on many, as, for example, S.X.26-28 (Fig. 21.2.20), the hair is thick and short and it has a tousled appearance, with the locks only roughly distinguished. Amongst the young men of the frieze, there is a remarkably unified style of depiction, though certain variations in treatment make it clear that different groups were executed by different hands: notice the lean face and clumsy features of S.VI.16 and the rounder face and much finer features of S.XII.33 (Figs. 21.2.19 and 22). Part of the interest in the heads of the frieze figures lies in the way in which their poses are subtly varied so that there is constant movement and change in the composition. The result is that the head is studied from many different angles. Many of the heads are shown in profile looking straight ahead, but others are shown in profile looking up or down. An example of a head looking up is that of the official signalling to riders in the procession as they advance (N.XXXIV.90, fig. 21.2.33). The man's look and gesture invite the viewer to turn his attention in the same direction. There are also many heads in full profile looking down, giving a more pensive, introverted expression: for instance, N.XLIII.118, and the beautiful covered head of N.XLIV.122 (Fig. 21.2.35). A number of heads are seen in three- quarter view (so Apollo, E.VI.39, fig. 21.2.6-7), adding variety to the composition. In some cases, this view can have the effect of suggesting a private conversation, as with the two elders, N.IX.31-32. There is also the often repeated scheme of the "moving-forward, glancing-backward attitude", as Jenkins describes it, of, for instance, the marshal (N. XXIII. 65, fig. 21.2.31), the foot-soldier (N.XII.47, fig. 21.2.30), and the youth (S.XXXI.79, fig. 21.2.24), which pulls the viewer in both directions, thus sustaining one's interest in the whole frieze.1472 The device is used repeatedly, and sometimes the head is shown not in three-quarter view but in profile (see, for instance, the youth, S.XLIV.135). A more unusual head pose is the fully frontal faces of the girl carrying stools (E.V.31) and the horse-rider who stares out in the direction of the spectators of the procession (N.XXXVI.98, fig. 21.2.34). The set of the head of figure S.XLIV.133 is also unusual: this man looks down behind his right shoulder, to see what is going on.1473 Very few fragments of the pedimental heads survive: Dionysos, figure D of the east pediment, still has his head (Figs. 21.3.5-6) and Athena on the west pediment retains part of the lower back of her head.1474 There is also a fragmentary veiled head, thought to belong to the east pediment (Fig. 21.3.14) and the famous 'Laborde' head in Paris (Fig. 1471 A good example is figure 145 on south frieze, slab XLVII. 1472 Jenkins (1994) 93. 1473 For a useful summary of the poses of the frieze figures and the direction in which each figure is looking, see the outline illustrations in Bird, Jenkins and Levi (1998). 1474 Delivorrias (1994) fig. 37.</page><page sequence="608">PARTHENON 593 21.3.15), which probably comes from one of the pediments too.1475 It is perhaps correct to infer from these pieces that the pedimental heads were in keeping with those of the frieze, in that they were smaller in relation to the whole body than Polykleitan heads, and they shared the same general form and idealizing expression. Figure D from the east pediment has a 'heroic' hairstyle with braids bound close at the nape of the neck. The shallow locks of hair on the head are comparable with those of the Greeks on the Parthenos shield.1476 Schweitzer compares the general shape of the head with that of the Lapith on metope S.3 1 (Fig. 21. 1.14). 1477 The veiled head, which is of colossal size and which was turned to its proper right, belonged to a matron, probably Hera, placed very near the centre of the composition. The figure had wavy hair, tied with a band and partially covered with a veil. Four rows of holes, on the band and above it, show where metal ornaments were attached. These are thought to have been leaves, flowers and berries, in the manner of the Hera on the Baksy krater. Palagia finds that the closest parallel to the helmet of Athena of the west pediment is probably that of the Hope Athena, but the number and arrangement of bronze attachments on the helmet (all of which had been lost by the later 17th century) suggest that the helmet was adorned in the manner of that of the Athena Parthenos.1478 From copies of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, one can form an idea of the appearance of the heads of young men, bearded men and Amazons. The Greek in the hair- pulling group has a deep head with small ears set far back (Figs. 6.46-47). 1479 Along with the unruly pattern of shallow locks on the head, the general impression created by these heads is not dissimilar to the head of S.XLVII.145. The latter, however, also has the full, down-turned lips so typical of many of the frieze figures. These do not appear on the copies of the hair-pulling group Greek, but they can be seen on one of the Piraeus copies of the Greek archer (fig. 6.54). 1480 A Piraeus copy of the bearded Greek wearing a pilos shows the same prominent cheek bones and sunken cheeks as observed on some of the heads of bearded elders on the frieze.1481 Meyer compares the head of the Munich relief Greek with that of the Vienna poet and the gentle Centaur of South metope 4. 1482 Harrison points to the similarities between the shape and proportions of the head of the seated Amazon seen from backview and those of the Athena Parthenos "as rendered in the Varvakeion statuette and the large statue of Athena signed by Antiochos in Rome".1483 1475 Athens, Akr.

Mostratos believes that the 'Laborde' head may come from the east pediment and belong with the Wegner torso. He identifies this figure as Eileithyia. 1476 Palagia (1993) 19 and fig. 33. 1477 Schweitzer (1939) figs. 38-40. 1478 Palagia (1993) 46. 1479 Cat. no. (6) 113.

VII. 51 and 55). The same sort of face was used for the Amazon attacking uphill, in the 'Kapaneus' group.1484 With regard to this figure, Harrison also points out that, like the Varvakeion statuette, she has tight curls in front of her ears as well as longer curls on the shoulders (Fig. 6.57). 1485 The Amazon of the Munich relief presents a completely different hairdo, having short, wavy hair that covers part of the forehead.1486 A Pheidian parallel for this arrangement can perhaps be seen in the fragment from the Imperial age copy from Ephesos of the sphinx fighting group, thought to come from the throne of the Zeus at Olympia.1487 Although the shield heads seem to show little emotion, two exceptions are the youth behind his shield in the group of three and 'Kapaneus' (Figs. 6.50 and 56).1488 In the former case, the boy's parted lips help to express his tense fear at the moment before he is attacked by the spears of his Amazon enemies, while in the latter the wounded man seems to be biting his lower lip, which is hidden under his beard. For the expression of emotion in the face, compare the sculptures of the pediments of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. As on the Parthenon frieze, shield heads are studied in a great variety of different positions: often shown in profile or three-quarter view, they are generally depicted looking up or down, rather than straight ahead, depending on where their adversary is placed. Some of the more unusual poses include the fully frontal, upside down head of the dead Amazon (Fig. 6.59), and the upturned head of the 'death-leap' Amazon, who is being pulled by the hair by her Greek adversary (Fig. 6.46 and 48). Although the exact poses vary, this hair- pulling motif is common in Greek vase paintings of Amazonomachies where the role of pulling an Amazon's hair or head is generally, though not always, reserved for Herakles. A similar motif occurs in sculpture too, as can be seen from the hair pulling group on the Amazonomachy pediment transported by the Romans to the temple of Apollo Sosianus in the forum at Rome.1489 This work probably dates from the 440s BC and, although its provenance is not certain, it may originate from the temple of Apollo at Eretria. With his right arm raised and wielding his club, Herakles is shown pulling back a fleeing Amazon. In this case the Amazon's pose is more contorted, for the head turns outwards and, while her right arm hangs down away from her body, the left arm is bent over her head as she tries to loosen the grip Herakles has on her. A similar pose is later used for the Amazon whom Herakles attacks on the Mausoleum Amazonomachy, where the Amazon's head is thrown back and the neck is not turned, though here the Amazon is down on her knees.1490 Another interesting head is that of the lower of the two Amazons with spears in 1484 Cat. no.

The Piraeus copy of this figure is, unfortunately, very damaged but it is possible that the head was shown in three-quarter view from the back (Fig. 6.52). 1491 3.2. FIGURE TYPES AND POSES On the metopes a good mastery of human anatomy is displayed and the inner frame of the body is realistically rendered. The veins, tendons, muscles, and bones beneath the flesh on, for instance, the figures of S.7 (Fig. 21.1.6), are carefully depicted. Nevertheless, on some metopes - as, for instance, S.26 (Fig. 21.1.7) - there is an almost Archaic delight in pattern and symmetry in the bodily forms, and certain Archaic mannerisms, such as the arched line to mark the upper limit of pubic hair, persist. Many different poses are attempted, some of them quite complex. The fallen Lapith in S.28 has a contorted pose, and the Centaurs of S.7 and S.28 are shown rearing (Fig. 21.1.6 and 10). 1492 In a number of metopes one can observe the deliberate avoidance of the traditional convention in sculpture of placing the feet of all standing figures flat on the ground. In Archaic and early Classical sculpture, such as the reliefs of the Treasuries of the Siphnians and the Athenians at Delphi, and the temple of Zeus at Olympia, figures were occasionally shown with one foot set at a higher level than the other, either when they were getting in or out of chariots or, as concerns this discussion, when they were engaged in combat. In scenes of combat, a figure might be shown with either a knee or a foot pushing against the body of his opponent. In the last slab of the north frieze of the Siphnian treasury, for example, the god is treading on a fallen giant; Herakles presses down on the hind quarters of the stag with his left knee on one of the metopes of the Athenian treasury at Delphi - a motif echoed in Olympia, west metope 5 - and he has one foot raised in west metopes 1 and 2, and east metopes 7 and 9 on the temple of Zeus at Olympia.1493 These ideas, which were already current in vase painting, added variety and interest to the standard duel, and they are used repeatedly on the Parthenon metopes. A good number of examples, particularly from the east and south sides, survive (Fig. 21.1.1). On E.l Hermes has his left foot raised on a giant's leg. On E.9 a giant presses against the left leg of Apollo with both his knee and his foot and on E.l 3 Hephaistos treads on the leg of a fallen giant. On W.10, which is very battered, Praschniker reconstructs the pose of the Greek with right foot treading on the leg of a fallen Amazon.1494 A Lapith pressing on a Centaur with his knee can be seen on S.l, S.2, and S.3 (Figs. 21.1.3-4), while the reverse situation, a Centaur pressing on a Lapith with his knee can be seen in S.7 (Fig. 21.1.6) 1491 Cat. no. (6) 125. Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 21. 1492 Notice that the Centaur of S.28 has been recognized on an uninspiring Athenian squat lekythos of about 430 BC (Getty, 71.AE.216). The movement of the left arm, covered in an animal skin, and of the right arm, wielding a vessel, loosely follow the Parthenon sculpture, as does the raised left front leg of the horse. But the vase-painter does not reproduce the dramatic rearing pose of the horse or the flying tail and paw of the animal skin behind the Centaur. He also omits the body of the fallen Lapith lying beneath the Centaur. Concerning this vase, see Schwab (1988) 83, no. 19, pl. 116, 1; Sparkes (1999) 4 and fig. 4. 1493 Boardman (1979) figs. 212 and 213 and (1985) fig. 22. 1494 See Berger (1986) 114.</page><page sequence="611">596 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS and S.8. On S.31 (Fig. 21.1.14), Lapith and Centaur wrestle with both their arms and their legs, as the Lapith' s knee is caught in the forelegs of the Centaur. A Lapith with one foot raised can be seen on S.26 (Fig. 21.1.7), where a Lapith pushes a Centaur, and perhaps on S.23 and S.24, where Lapiths are shown treading on a wine jar and the hind quarters of a Centaur in Carrey's drawings.1495 Two metopes show a slightly different approach, with the raised foot for the first time being placed on a rock: although very battered, W.8 probably showed a Greek stepping up onto a rock. E.6 showed Poseidon with one foot set on a rock. The use of a rock as a foot support, which is seen several times on the frieze and repeatedly on the shield, and which became very popular in later works, finds its earliest sculptural expression on the Parthenon. It is recorded by Pausanias as having been used by the early Classical mural painter, Polygnotos, in his painting of Antilochos in the underworld for the Lesche of the Knidians at Delphi.1496 Though unusual, climbing figures were not unheard of in Greek vase painting: see, for instance, the amphora in Munich showing the punishment of sinners in Hades, dating from around 540-530 BC.1497 One metope which shows a strong connection with painting is N.29, figuring Selene on horseback descending a rocky slope, with the crescent moon in the sky. This compares closely with the Florence oenochoe, dating from around 460 BC (Fig. 2 1.1. 2). 1498 As pointed out by Marcadé, the scheme of the metope was probably fairly close to the scheme used for Selene on the Parthenos statue base, as far as one can judge from the sketchy outlines remaining on the Lenormant statuette (Fig. 6.82).1499 A further link between the metopes and Pheidias may perhaps be found in N.l, showing the rising Helios and his horses (only the top part of the chariot wheels were shown at the bottom of the metope), and the equivalent group on the left end of the Lenormant statuette base. On the frieze almost all Archaic tendencies have vanished.1500 The naturalism with which the human figure is rendered illustrates the skill of the sculptors who worked on this masterpiece. Great care was shown in the execution of details such as the knees, especially on young, athletic bodies.1501 The tense muscles of N.XXIII.64, and S.XXXI.79, add to the movement and vitality of the scenes in which they figure and contrast well with the relaxed physiques of the older men on the east side (Figs. 21.2.31 and 24). In addition, the frieze sculptors succeed in creating truly feminine women. This is particularly clear in the goddesses of the east side, where the female form is well articulated through the drapery (Figs. 21.2.1-2). As in so many other aspects, the frieze is rich and varied in its array of figure poses. There are some excellent studies of the male nude as, for instance, W.III.4, W.V.9, and W.XII.22, all of which show different experiments with the new 'Polykleitan' leg positions and varying degrees of contrapposto (Figs. 21.2.12, and 15). There is also the 1495 See Berger (1986) 112. 1496 Pausanias, X.30.3. 1497 Antikensammlungen, 1493. 1498 Mus. arch. 3996; Gury (1994) 709, no. 35. 1499 Marcadé (1993) 364, and figs. 1-4. 1500 Exceptions are the chariot and driver N.XXVIII.73. 1501 West frieze, slab V, figs. 9, 22 and 23, for example.</page><page sequence="612">PARTHENON 597 bold design of N.XXIII.65, where the nudity of the figure is dramatically set off against the background of the man's himation (Fig. 21.2.31). As noted earlier, the heads of figures are seen in a number of different positions; the corresponding body poses show much greater freedom of movement than one would expect in contemporary free-standing sculpture. The horseman S.X.26, for instance, is shown in full profile (Fig. 21.2.20). But S.III. 8 has his right leg and head shown in profile while his torso is shown in three-quarter frontal view. Another interesting case is W.XIII.25, a standing figure, whose left leg and head are seen in profile, while his torso and right leg are shown in three-quarter back view.1502 Where there are many standing figures, as on the east side, variety is introduced into the composition by using both the so called 'Attic' and 'Polykleitan' stances. The more old-fashioned 'Attic' stance showed the figure standing with his weight resting principally on the leg that was set back; the other, relaxed leg was set forwards. By contrast, in the newer, 'Polykleitan' stance, the weight was carried on the leg that was set forward. In general the women are given an 'Attic' stance, but sometimes, as when they stand in a group, alternating women are given a 'Polykleitan' stance. Slab E.I shows a marshal, standing frontally but with his head turned back towards the procession following him and towards which he is gesturing. His legs are set in a 'Polykleitan' stance, with a strong contrapposto. Slab E.II shows five maidens standing, alternately, in 'Attic' and 'Polykleitan' poses. Slab E.III depicts eleven maidens in procession, headed by two men in himatia. Figure 18 stands in 'Polykleitan' pose, but most of the maidens stand in 'Attic' pose, except perhaps figure 11. Figures 19-23, who are matched on slab E.VI by figures 43-46 are all distinguished by the fact that they carry a stave and, along with figure 42, Eros, most of them are studies of leaning figures. The pose of figures 22 and 44, with legs crossed and the stave under the left arm, recalls certain grave stelai of the Archaic and early Classical periods.1503 Figure 22 is echoed in one of the figures of the Ilissos frieze, probably dating to the 420s BC: the man on the right on the slab in Berlin.1504 The subtly different poses of each of the seated gods of the east frieze (figures 24-30 and 36-41) - which range from the strictly formal to the relaxed, and almost reclining - brilliantly display their different moods and personalities: the jovial pose of Dionysos may be compared to the rather pensive attitude of Demeter and the anxiously restless attitude of Ares, figures 25-27. Aphrodite's pose hints at that of figure M on the east pediment. The remaining figures of the east side comprise three marshals in 'Polykleitan' stance, two maidens in 'Attic' stance, another marshal in 'Polykleitan' stance and eleven maidens in 'Attic' stance. On the north frieze two poses which stand out are those of the man holding the kithara, N.VIII.26 (Fig. 21.2.28), which, apart from the head movement, is similar to the Doryphoros, and that of N.X.38 (Fig. 21.2.29), resembling the Diadoumenos. 1502 This figure is probably the basis for the horseman who appears on an Athenian red- figure pelike of around 430 BC, Berlin F 2357. See Beazley (1963) 1134, 8; Robertson (1992) 227; Sparkes (1999) 4 and fig. 6. For other instances of imitations of frieze figures in vase-painting see Ferrara, 44894 (T57C VP), an Athenian volute-krater from Spina showing a sacrificial procession (Matheson (1995) pl. 123C); Harvard, 1959.129, a red-figure oinochoe from Vari, with the same subject; Tampa, 86.64, a red-figure pelike from Italy, with a horseman wearing a petasos.

Mus., inv. 1483c; see Picón (1978) fig. 5.</page><page sequence="613">598 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS As on the metopes, there are several examples of frieze figures with one foot set at a higher level than the other. Figure W.XIV.26 (Fig. 21.2.16), who is trying to control a rearing horse, has his left knee on the animal's hind quarters, very much in the manner of the Lapith on metope S.3 (Fig. 21.1.4). N.XXIV.68, N.XXVII.71 and N.XXVIII.74 are all shown climbing up into their chariots, a motif known in relief sculpture since Archaic times.1505 But the other examples - which are the earliest known in sculpture - tend to be complex figure poses which use a rock as a support: W.VI.12 and W.XV.29 are adjusting a sandal (Figs. 21.2.13 and 17); W.VIII.15 and S.XLIII.130 are restraining an animal (Figs. 21.2.14 and 25). The pose of W.XV.29, whose upper body leans over the raised leg, is not far removed from west metope 1 from the temple of Zeus at Olympia, which shows Herakles resting with one foot on top of the dead Nemean lion. Similarly, the 'restrained animal' pose, with one foot using a rock to give added strength to the figure, is not unlike the animal restraining poses of Herakles in the Olympia metopes W4 and E8. A less complicated case is N.XII.47, who is shown striding forwards and stepping up on to a rock as he does so (Fig. 21.2.30). This is very much in the manner of the shield figures. Through careful observation of frieze figure types and poses, the work of Neils and Younger sheds new light on the meaning of the frieze and the techniques used to create it. Neils comments upon the deliberate structure of the frieze, which moves from the chaotic west side, with its unruly horses, towards the calm and the order which pervade the east side, thus harmonizing with the pediments above. The cavalcade of the south and north sides urgently carries the viewer forwards, while the procession in front slows one down, to arrive serenely at the front of the temple. Neils identifies the traditional inspection of horses, the dokimasia, taking place on W.XII. The figure in front of the horse, W.XII.23, is the herald signalling the start of the procession. The gods, she thinks, must be imagined sitting in a semicircle, receiving the procession as it arrives from north and south, while the peplos scene takes place in the middle.1506 Younger concentrates on an analysis of the technique of the frieze, in particular the use of recurring figure patterns.1507 He concludes that the work was carried out in sections, separated by 'buffer' zones, which were generally filled later with what he calls transitional figures. Within each section units could be made up, at least in part, from compositions which must have been available to the sculptors in the form of sketches that could be transferred as necessary. As an example of a buffer zone, Younger points out the uncarved expanse of stone on the right side of similar prancing horses on slabs S.XVI and S.XIX. Figures N.XI.44 and N.XII.47, who share the same basic pose, with the right leg slightly bent and the left leg trailing, are used to fill two other buffer zones. A comparison of the two figures tying their sandals, W.VI.12 and W.XV.29, again shows how the same motif could be reused in two different places, the main difference being the amount of space available: for W.VI.12 not much space was left, so the figure had to be fitted in more tightly. In some places entire compositions were repeated. In W.III and W.XII a similar cartoon was probably used in each case but then variations were introduced to each figure to suit the context. In slabs S.VI and S.IX, and slabs S.XI and S.XII, the position of the horses' heads is very similar. On the west frieze, 1505 See Akropolis 1342, frieze fragment, Boardman (1979) fig. 200, as well as the west frieze of the Siphnian Treasury, showing Athena and Aphrodite climbing in and out of chariots. 1506 Neils (2004) 43-62. 1507 Younger (2004) 63-85.</page><page sequence="614">PARTHENON 599 where horses' tails are sometimes not continued on to a neighbouring slab, it seems that each slab must have been worked separately without an overall design for artists to follow. But even on other parts of the frieze, where the overlaps are numerous and the design is continuous, mistakes of carving were occasionally made and, as Younger shows with regard to N.XLI, these were often dissimulated with extra drapery patterns. The composition of the pedimental groups shows an ingenious use of the difficult space available for sculptures in the low and shallow triangular frame imposed by the gables. The pattern of each group is fairly traditional in that standing figures towards the centre of the groups give way to seated figures, who in their turn give way to kneeling and then reclining figures at the angles (for possible reconstructions, see Figs. 21.3.1-3). Thus figure poses of many different types are included in each composition and the awkward frames are filled down to the corner angles. One of the unusual features of the Parthenon pedimental groups is how full they are. Many figures are packed into the available spaces, more than had ever been seen in such a group. Even more remarkable is the fact that several figures do not quite fit. In some cases, for example, figure D on the east side, a limb overhangs the edge of the gable (Fig. 21.3.4). In the case of Helios (A) and Selene (N) and their chariot teams on the east side, it is clear that it was the deliberate intention of the designer to represent only a part of each of these figures. Such a device had already been used on some of the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Cut off figures include those of Eurystheus in the pithos in the first metope on the east side, and Cerberus being dragged from Hades in the fifth metope. The effect is to lessen the impact of the frame by suggesting that the scene continues outside its confines. In the case of the east pediment of the Parthenon, it suggests a curved rather than a linear conception. Rounded patterns were also used for the outer and, one suspects, the inner compositions of the Parthenos shield compositions. They hint at the influence of painting. Several figures in the pedimental groups lean forward. West pediment A (Fig. 21.3.10) and V are two notable examples. This device would have made the figures more visible from ground level. At the same time it helped to give extra depth to the composition and avoid rigidly vertical poses. Another important feature of the Parthenon pediments is that each one succeeds in unifying the various figures in the compositions in such a way that they all appear to be taking part in one action. These sophisticated compositions stand in contrast with, for example, the simpler pedimental groups of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, where the figures on the east side all remain quite isolated from each other, while the figures on the west side seem to divide into small sub-groups. In the Parthenon pediments the impression of a unified action is partly achieved by having the sculptures in such close proximity to one another, but it is strengthened by the development of the figure poses from the centre outwards, as described above, coupled with varied turns of the heads, which make the spectator look first in one direction, then in the other. In this respect, one important motif, which has already been observed on the frieze and which will be seen again on the shield Amazonomachy, is that of a figure looking in one direction while moving in another. Figure G on the east pediment (Fig. 21.3.7), and figures H, L (Fig. 21.3.12), M and V on the west pediment all exemplify this idea. On the west side of the temple, a dramatic event takes place in the central space of the pediment, to which the assembled figures on either side are shown, by their poses, to react. The effect of the central action is most strongly felt by the figures standing close by, and it gradually diminishes the further the figures are from the centre. The emphatic central group, which dominates the scene, is composed of Athena and Poseidon apparently</page><page sequence="615">600 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS drawing away from each other. Athena's left and Poseidon's right legs form a cross, the upper diagonals of which are continued in the outward lean of their two bodies and culminate in the inwardly turned heads of the two gods as they stare defiantly at each other. This very dramatic pair draws the viewer's attention to the heart of the composition. A similar group occurs on the Amazonomachy on a Roman statue base found at Nikopolis, which Fink thought might imitate the Amazonomachy on the footstool of the Zeus at Olympia.1508 Surviving fragments of statues of horses suggest that the explosive central pair in the western pedimental group was originally framed by pairs of rearing horses. The violent reaction of the horses to the central scene enhances the feeling of drama. In addition, the horses act as a frame for the scene, separating the central gods from all the other figures in the group and, by looking at the gods, they force the viewer's attention inwards. After the horses come the charioteers and two figures set just behind the chariot teams, probably Hermes on the left and the winged Iris on the right. In these figures too a forceful symmetry dominates, though subtle changes are introduced in each side to avoid monotony. While figure O, Amphitrite, is shown still sitting in her chariot, with the left foot just about to touch the ground, Figure G, probably Nike, is one stage ahead: she is already standing up and trying to rein in her chariot team, while using her right foot set on the ground as a break. Her pose is akin to that of figures shown restraining animals on the frieze. And while the torsos of figures H and N (Fig. 21.3.13) both lean inwards, H's head was turned away from the central action, while that of N was turned towards it. The motif of the central cross is echoed in the crossing limbs of G and H on one side and N and O on the other. Beyond, the groups of onlookers are much calmer and noticeably less involved in the proceedings. As Boardman says, some of the figures "attend rather than watch the outcome of the struggle".1509 And yet figure C clings to B, probably Kekrops, in an attitude of fear (Fig. 21.3.11), and the kneeling figure V seems to shrink back in alarm towards W. The movement of C and V away from the centre follows that of their neighbours, D and E on the left side and U on the right side, all of whom lean away from the vertical towards the corners. Palagia, following Simon, suggests that the figure poses are best understood in terms of a reaction to an explosion. She suggests that Athena has already been declared the winner of the contest for the land of Attica, much to Poseidon's fury, and that the scene depicts the moment when Zeus sends a thunderbolt crashing down to earth to recall the disappointed Poseidon to order.1510 The importance of the pedimental group as the first known representation of the scene is commented on by Boardman.151 1 1508 Fink (1964/1965) 70ff. 1509 Boardman (1985a) 99. 1510 Palagia (1993) 44.

But see Palagia (1993) figure 11, for an Attic red-figure hydria of around 400 BC bearing a comparable scene: Pella Museum, 80.514.

Sparkes considers that the outsized thunderbolt is more probably the vase-painter's way of making his scene explicit rather than an accurate imitation of the Parthenon west pediment.

B and C (Fig. 21.2.11) exhibit the mastery with which group compositions could be handled, and the perfect proportions of the kneeling figure C show how far Greek sculpture had matured since the production of the awkward and unsatisfactory Lapith Q from the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. The powerfully modelled figure of V is another noteworthy study of the male nude and its juxtaposition with the sensuously draped figure W, now sadly damaged but reminiscent of figure M on the east side, would have enhanced the sculpture. Because of the damage done to the east pediment from early times, its composition is less well known than that of the west side. The sculptural remains from the outer parts of the group are of the highest quality. Pausanias records, slightly enigmatically, that on the east pediment 'everything has to do with the birth of Athena', Tîàvra es ttjv ' AGrļvās ëxei yeveaiv.1513 The scene was framed by the rising of Helios and his chariot team on the left side and the setting of Selene and her exhausted team on the right, a motif echoed in other parts of the Parthenon sculptures as well as in those of the Zeus at Olympia and, therefore, probably rightly connected with the name of Pheidias. Reclining and then seated figures occupy the next spaces, but the symmetry of the two sides is deliberately tempered. Figures K, L and M are three female studies of great beauty (Fig. 21.3.8). While K is seated in an upright pose and leans gently away from the corner angle, L turns in the other direction, and sits in a more hunched attitude. She is apparently much more preoccupied by M, who reclines partly on her lap, while looking out towards the corner of the gable. M seems completely oblivious of what is going on behind her. On the other side, two seated females are now set next to a reclining male, figure D, who is probably Dionysos (Fig. 21.3.4-6). Again the reclining figure looks away from the main action, apparently unaffected by it, but the two seated figures show a growing concern with what is going on towards the centre of the scene. The interest of figure F is apparent in her pose (Fig. 21.3.7): she is set three-quarters to the right, with her left knee pointing to the right and her left arm raised to greet figure G, who is shown starting towards her from the main action. Figure E marks the transition between D and F. She sits almost fully frontally, but while her right knee points out towards the corner of the gable, she sits very close beside F and she rests her left arm on F's shoulder. Unlike her counterpart on the other side of the pediment, figure L, she is more closely tied to F than to D. Figure D presents an unusual pose and one that invites comparison with the reclining figure in the left angle of the west pediment. Figure A of the west side props himself up on his left arm. His right arm and his right leg would have been relaxed, while his left leg lay beneath them. Figure D, on the other hand, is a much more fully three-dimensional figure, for not only does he lean to one side, but he also sits back in a very relaxed attitude. With his legs bent and set apart, the god holds himself up on his left forearm, which rests on a prominence covered in cloth and the identifying panther skin. Since D's weight rests largely on his supporting left arm, his left side is extended and his right side is contracted. The result is a very pleasing study of contrapposto in a seated figure. 1512 Palagia (1993) 47. 1513 Pausanias, 1.24.5.</page><page sequence="617">602 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS The composition of the central group of the pediment and that of the groups immediately next to it remain enigmatic. These sculptures had already disappeared long before 1674, when the Parthenon sculptures were drawn by an anonymous artist travelling with the Marquis of Nointel, who is usually identified as Jacques Carrey. The presence of Dionysos near one of the angles suggests that most of the other major Greek deities were present too, and one would expect the protagonists Athena, Zeus and Hephaistos to have been positioned close to the centre. A colossal left hand of Zeus, clutching his thunderbolt, a fragment of a lyre, pointing to the presence of Apollo, and a fragment of a female hand with a torch, which may indicate Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, have all been associated with the east pediment, but Palagia remains sceptical about these attributions.1514 In all known depictions of the birth of Athena Zeus is shown seated. This has suggested to many scholars that he was probably shown seated on the Parthenon too.1515 Delivorrias insists that an indoor setting, with Zeus seated on his throne, is much more likely than an outdoor setting and a rock seat, as Berger proposes.1516 This suggests the possibility that the Zeus of the east pediment of the Parthenon was in some senses a precursor of Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia. That Zeus held a thunderbolt is perhaps surprising, since it is a strongly traditional element and one which became rare in the iconography of Zeus in the Classical period. It did not feature in the Olympian image of Zeus. It did feature, however, in the iconography of the famous Roman image, the Jupiter Capitolinus, a work which is thought to have been influenced by the Olympian Zeus and which may well have been influenced by the Zeus of the east pediment too.1517 The thunderbolt took on important new meaning under the influence of the Stoics as a symbol of the cosmic 'tonos' which creates the tension holding the Universe together. Against this view of the central scene, Palagia argues that all the available archaeological evidence, notably the weathermarks and the cuttings in the geison blocks, as well as the technical difficulties associated with having a seated figure at the centre of a pedimental composition, which would be unparalleled in Greek sculpture, speak in favour of a standing figure of Zeus (Fig. 21.3.1).1518 Further archaeological investigations may prove her point if fragments of the statue are recovered. Already the colossal big toe from the unshod right foot of a standing figure has been attributed to Zeus by Mantis.1519 Delivorrias suggests that Athena probably stood on Zeus's right side, while Hephaistos stood on his left.1520 But several scholars, including Palagia, prefer to think that Zeus was flanked by Athena and Hera, with Hephaistos placed next to Athena, a little further from the centre of the scene. Such a trio, with Hera on Zeus's right and Athena on his left, 1514 For the left hand of Zeus (Akropolis Museum, 5679) see Despinis (1982) pls. 18-19, 23 and Mostratos (2004) 132-33.

This painting has been thought by some to echo the central composition of the east pediment of the Parthenon, even though it is clear that the artist felt quite free to borrow details where he chose.1521 References to the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos show that his Zeus and Athena were strongly influenced by these sculptures. From the evidence of the Baksy krater, coupled with the fact that several post-Parthenon vases show a similar arrangement, Shefton argues that the head, Akropolis 2381, which is thought to belong to the east pediment figure of Hera, was probably adorned with flower tips on long stalks inserted in the large holes that can be seen on the head (Fig. 21.3. 14). 1522 This head was originally turned strongly to its right. Some people have seen this as a reason for arguing that Hera was set on Zeus 's left and turning towards him. But, as Shefton points out, it is also possible that Hera was set on Zeus's right and shown turning away from her consort in disgust.1523 Whether the figure of Hera can be restored from the fragments put together by Wegner remains controversial but at least possible. The Wegner peplos figure is of a colossal size, and must have stood very near the centre of the scene. Palagia supports the view that Athena would have been set on Zeus's right side. In the Archaic and Classical periods, this was the place of honour, and it would have matched the goddess's position on the west pediment. If Palagia is correct about a calmly standing central triad of gods, then it becomes clear that, unlike the explosive west pediment, the east side showed a quiet scene in which there was greater movement towards the gable corners than at the centre. Parallels for such a composition are the east pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, the east frieze of the temple of Athena Nike, and the statue base of the Athena Parthenos, showing the birth of Pandora. The birth of Athena would then have been implied rather than dominant, contrary to the traditional view which, as it is now known, was erroneously based on the Madrid puteal, a creation dating from no earlier than the 4th century BC. Such an unconventional representation of the event might well account for Pausanias's unusual phrasing in 1.24.5. Mostratos agrees with Palagia and suggests that it is the moment after the birth which has been chosen for depiction, when Athena is calm and perhaps unarmed. Such a scene would be in keeping with other parts of the sculptural programme, notably the Parthenos statue base and the east frieze of the temple.1524 The Piraeus copies of shield figures vary considerably in their standard of execution and this is very noticeable in the modelling of figures. The hands and arms of the Amazon in the best preserved - though not the most faithful - copy of the archer group are decidedly weak, for instance.1525 But from the context and from other copies of this figure it is clear that the Amazon's left arm was not shown in this position on the original work. From 1521 Shefton (1982) 162 first thought of the Baksy krater as perhaps "the earliest quotation from the central portion of the East pediment". He later added the cautionary remark, Shefton (1992) 246, that "to work back to the pediment in a literal way" from the krater would not be possible. 1522 For the Baksy krater see Shefton (1992) pl. 54, 1.

The treatment of the three-quarter frontal view torso of the Greek in the hair-pulling group is unemphatic and realistic (Figs. 6.46-47). The line of the pubic hair on this figure is straight, showing a more advanced treatment than on the metopal figures of the Parthenon.1526 His adversary, though clearly as fit as any athlete, is realistically female. That the right breast is exposed is significant. One of the earliest vases to show an Amazon with a breast exposed, not accidentally as in earlier examples, and drawn in proper perspective, is the volute-krater in New York, dating from the second quarter of the 5th century BC.1527 Some of the Lapith women on the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia are also shown with one breast uncovered. The Amazon's chiton, with its short skirt billowing out at the back and the top part falling in such a way that half the torso is bare, is strikingly close to the garb of some of the male foot soldiers of the Parthenon frieze, as, for instance, N.XXIII.64 (Fig. 21.2.31). As shown in chapter 6.3, some features of the shield composition as well as certain poses can be traced back to vase paintings of the early Classical period, and it seems probable that the main influence on both these vases and the shield was the major art of free painting, which is now almost completely lost to us. Some of the most striking aspects of the shield are its use of so many different levels of terrain, with figures striding up and down the field, the almost complete absence of overlapping, its characteristic use of diagonal groupings, with adversaries coming at each other from above and from below, and the great preference shown for three-quarter views. Although used in different ways and to differing degrees on the Parthenon sculptures, some of these features are common to both groups of works. Comparison of the shield Amazonomachy with the Parthenon west metopes is very difficult because of the very battered state of this series of metopes (Fig. 21.1.1). At first sight the two works appear to have been very different, for at least half of the metopes showed an Amazon on horseback, usually with a Greek at the horse's feet, and some of the others showed some very standard duels, with poses familiar from earlier vase painting and sculpture: the Greek pulling a fallen Amazon by the head (W.14); an Amazon in a suppliant's pose, rather like 'Kapaneus' on the shield (W.10); an Amazon attacking in an Aristogeiton type pose (W.2); a Greek attacking in a Harmodios type pose (W.4). In addition, most of the figures stood on the same ground level, though the Greek in W.8 seems to have been climbing onto a rock. Nevertheless, the use of horses, as well as at least two kneeling figures (in W.10 and W.14) means that the preference for strong diagonal lines of composition, which can be seen on the shield, is to some extent echoed in the much more enclosed format of the metopes. Similar types of poses can be seen on the shield and the Parthenon reliefs. The twisted pose of the dead Greek at the bottom of the shield may be compared with the Lapith on south metope 28 (Figs. 6.32, 36, 37 and 21.1.10). Two types of figures which make an interesting comparison, although the actions are different in each case, are the foot soldiers climbing in or out of chariots on the Parthenon frieze and the climbing Amazons of the 1526 For these two figures see cat. nos. (6) 124 and 1 13, figs. 6.50 and 46. 1527 07.286.84; fig. 6.68; Bothmer (1957) 161, no. 7, pl. LXXV.</page><page sequence="620">PARTHENON 605 shield.1528 The short chitons with fine folds billowing out behind the figures enhance the likeness. W.XIV.27 (Fig. 21.2.16) on the frieze is a frontal figure, who looks to his right while his body leans strongly to his left as he attempts to control the horse on his right side. He stands on two separate blocks of stone, the one under his left foot being about twice as high as the other. This figure may be compared with the adversary of the pilos- wearer on the Parthenos shield: the position of the legs, the lean towards the figure's left while the face looks to their right, the higher position of the left foot, all these aspects are quite similar, even if certain details, such as the position of the right foot, the arm movements and the head position are different. Despite the battered state of metope E.8, it seems that the giant on the right was in a pose mirroring that of 'Kapaneus' on the shield. On the shield, where there is hardly a single figure who stands with both feet on level ground, the interrelation between figure pose and background is very great, much more so than on the temple sculptures. There, the flat base line of metopes, frieze and pediments is strongly felt, even if isolated rocks are sometimes used to give individual figures a different pose. An exception is perhaps the composition of the metope E.6, which is dominated by its rocky landscape. It is discussed in the section concerning landscape elements. As well as figures shown stepping with one foot on to higher ground - as, for instance, the Amazon with an axe, the pilos-wearer and his adversary, the Munich Greek, and the Greek in the 'death-leap' group - there are also combatants shown climbing (the Amazon in the archer group and the Amazon facing the stone-thrower), sitting, apparently on sloping ground (two of the Amazons in the group of six), and kneeling, again on sloping ground, for the figures have one knee on the ground and the other leg stretching down (the Amazons with spears in the group of three). Amongst the most original poses on the shield are those of the 'death-leap' Amazon, the Greek helping his comrade and the two Amazons in the lower left quadrant, both of whom are wounded and are sinking to the ground. These two figures make a similar movement with their right arms, to relieve the wounds in the neck and back. It may be compared with the movement of the left arm of the almost completely hidden Amazon under one of the handles of the early Classical volute-krater in New York.1529 The strong foreshortening involved in the pose of the upper Amazon in the group of three probably reflects the influence of painting. 1528 Consider, for example, N.XXVII.72 on the frieze and the 'Kapaneus' group Amazon, as preserved on the Patras shield and Piraeus relief, no. 2206, Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 12. 1529 07.286.84; for an illustration, see Bothmer (1957) pl. LXXV. On the same vase, compare the Greek behind the chariot team, feeling for the arrow in his right shoulder blade.</page><page sequence="621">4. LANDSCAPE One of the most innovative aspects of the sculptures of the Parthenon is the use of landscape elements. These appear on all three sculptural groups of the temple, in a variety of different ways and serving several different functions. In many cases, the examples from the Parthenon are the first known of their type in Greek sculpture. In this respect, as in so many others, the influence of the Parthenon on later sculpture was remarkable. An analysis of the use of landscape elements on the Parthenon and a comparison with the shield of the Athena Parthenos by Pheidias reveals that similar ideas lie behind these works. Taken along with similarities in the depiction of drapery, figure types and poses, they suggest a close connection between the Parthenon sculptures and Pheidias. In his study of the instances and the functions of landscape elements in the sculptures of the Parthenon, Waywell draws attention to the fact that although landscape elements appear in these works with a frequency which is remarkable compared with earlier sculptures, their presence is nevertheless limited and discreet, and there are signs that they are used in an experimental manner.1530 Most of the metopes do not have landscape elements at all. On the frieze, rocks alone feature: they occur chiefly on the west side and the eastern ends of the north and south sides, where there are walking or standing figures, but they do not seem to occur on the east side. On the pediments, where landscape elements had never before been used in Greek sculpture, rocky ground can be seen under most of the surviving figures of the west side and the olive tree and salt spring may also have been depicted, while on the east side water as well as rocks are shown. The function of landscape elements varies considerably. On a small number of metopes, but not on the frieze or pediments, the scene is set on a continuous running groundline of rock, and on both the metopes and frieze individuals are sometimes shown standing on separate little islands of rock, depicted as low plinths or rocky outcrops.1531 The significance and distribution of these elements is not clear. They are not confined to scenes depicting a particular subject and when they occur the degree of naturalism in their treatment is variable. This indicates that the sculptors were experimenting, more or less successfully, with new ideas. To expect indications of locality from these rocks is probably to read far too much into their rather haphazard appearances. Much more important and successful, is the use of rocks to support complex figure poses. So, for instance, the sculpturally innovative 'restrained animal' and 'sandal tying' poses of the frieze, which had never before appeared in sculpture, though the latter at least was known in painting and they both seem to be a natural development from earlier ideas.1532 There is also the new use of rock in the well known action pose, showing 1530 Waywell (1984) 312ff. 1531 For examples of a continuous rocky groundline, see metopes SI and 30, N29, E7 and W3; for 4 islands' of rock, see metopes S.8, 9, 12, and frieze W.XIV.25-27. 1532 'Restrained animal', S.XLIII.130 and W.VIII.15; 'sandal tying', W.VI.12 and W.XV.29.</page><page sequence="622">PARTHENON 607 people stepping vigorously forwards.1533 In earlier sculpture, figures were shown stepping up on to their fallen adversary, a chariot or some nearby object, but not on to a rock. The close connection of rocks with iconography makes it clear that, as in the first group, the elements that appear are in most cases not intended to indicate more about locality than the general idea that the scene takes place out of doors. Another class of landscape elements includes those which act almost like an attribute or a stage prop, helping to identify a figure or situate a scene, in much the same way as non- landscape elements can be used. The sea under Helios on the east pediment, the moon in the sky above Selene, N.29 metope; and the rocky island behind Poseidon and Polybotes, in E.6 metope all fall into this category. There is also the ship and landing ladder in N.2 metope and the peplos statue on a base, at which Helen takes refuge in N.25 metope. Similarly in the series on the south side, water jars appear now and again (see, for example S.4 and S.9), thus indicating that the brawl took place in the context of a feast. This is significant for it shows that the designer of the series was following the new version of the Centauromachy myth, which dates back to the second quarter of the 5th century BC. In sculpture this version was first seen on the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, but the idea probably originated from one of the murals of the Theseion at Athens.1534 In some cases, as for instance in N.29 metope, the moon not only helps to identify the figure of Selene, but it also enhances the background scene, and the beginnings of a true landscape emerge: Selene is shown carefully descending a rocky slope on horseback, with the sky indicated behind her by the presence of the moon. The image is very close to one familiar from vase painting, and it is probable that the similarity with painting was even closer when the metope was new and still brightly coloured.1535 As on the vase, there may have been stars painted in the sky originally. This metope is remarkable for the interesting landscape scenery within which the figure is seen to move. The pictorial quality of the background scene may well have been important in a number of other metopes, but this is not so easy to appreciate when all the paint has gone and almost nothing but the figure sculpture remains. N.l metope, showing a charioteer driving his team of horses over an uneven groundline, may in fact depict Helios rising over the sea; the horses definitely appear to be moving upwards rather than just rearing, for some of the back legs appear not to have been at ground level. Thus the colour of the background and the base of the composition would have been very important in clarifying the interpretation of the scene. N.2 metope, which shows part of a ship and a landing ladder in the background, is another example of a scene which owes a debt to painting and again background colours would have enhanced the picture. In E.14 metope the smooth band of stone at the base of the composition, which partially hides the legs of horses and deity, is characterized as the sea by the depiction of a duck sitting on it at one end and fish swimming within it at the other end. Such details, which are unique in Greek sculpture, add to the pictorial aspect of the metope and again one wonders what other details may originally have been added in paint to enhance the scene. In some parts of the sculptural programme it is clear that the artists were not just trying to set the scene with landscape elements, they were actually trying to suggest the 1533 For instance, in the case of N.XII.47 and N.XXIII.65. 1534 This matter is discussed by Barron (1972) 25ff. 1535 Compare Florence, Mus. Arch. 3996, fig. 21.1.2; LIMC VII, 709, no. 35.</page><page sequence="623">608 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS topography of real places in which the actions are supposed to have taken place. For instance, Zeus and Hera of metopes N.31 and N.32 sit on rock seats which are reminiscent of Athena's seat on W.3 in the metopes from the temple of Zeus at Olympia. It is possible that these serve to represent Mount Olympus, from whose heights the gods were said to discuss the fighting at Troy. Most advanced of all was surely the treatment of the west pediment where the rocky ground, in combination with the olive tree, and perhaps the salt spring, represented the Athenian Akropolis, on which Athena and Poseidon once held their famous confrontation. The rocks serve two purposes at once: they indicate locality, and at the same time they are used to support various figure poses. Since it seems clear that the west pediment is set on the Athenian Akropolis, people have been tempted to identify one unified locality for the scene on the east pediment, perhaps Mount Olympus. As Waywell argues, there are difficulties with this idea, for while figures A, B and C have water beneath them, D is on rock, E and F are seated on chests while the figure at the right end of the pediment, Selene, is not, as one might expect, shown on water like A.1536 Turning to the frieze, the rocky outcrops there have also been seen as indications of locality by, for example Fehl, who interprets the rocky west side of the frieze as the Kerameikos, the smooth western parts of the north and south sides as the level roadway leading towards the Akropolis, which gradually gives way to rockier ground at the eastern ends of these sides as the procession starts to go up the Akropolis.1537 The humans on the east side are therefore visualized as standing on the Akropolis, while the gods are on Mount Olympus, as indicated, according to Fehl, by the traces of rock under their feet.1538 Waywell shows that this explanation is unlikely for several reasons: the gods are seated on chairs rather than the rock seats usually used to indicate a mountain location; the traces of rock under the feet of the gods - which can barely be seen - may have no significance at all as far as the interpretation of the scene is concerned as they may simply be bits of stone not completely removed by the sculptors; thirdly, many of the rocks on the frieze are so closely linked with particular figure poses that it seems unnecessary to seek any further explanation for their inclusion.1539 The use of landscape elements on the frieze is minimal, while on the pediments many of the elements are so discreetly used that they would have been barely visible from ground level - a fact which argues against their importance in the interpretation of the scene. On the metopes, on the other hand, the more obvious and varied use of landscape elements, together with non-landscape elements, in some of the compositions suggests that the artists were consciously attempting to provide an intelligible setting for a character or an action through the use of background scenery. The influence for this can in some cases be traced back to the art of painting, but it seems probable that drama too may have been an important source of inspiration. The individual figure poses and the group compositions on the Parthenos shield make it clear that background scenery formed an essential part of the original composition of this work. Nearly every figure on the shield presupposes an uneven groundline and many suggest steeply rising terrain. Furthermore, the generous spacing of the figures in the 1536 Waywell (1984) 312-13. 1537 Fehl (1961) 1-19. 1538 Fehl (1961) 10-19. 1539 Waywell (1984) 314; cf.

There is no trace of a background on surviving fragments of the small-scale stone or terracotta copies of the shield: on these the figures were executed in low relief while any details and the background would probably have been added in paint. On the Piraeus copies, walls and columns are included in certain copies as well as rocks. The walls and columns are rendered in very low relief, but some of the rock masses are given considerable depth. These feature in the same plane as the human figures and are often an integral part of a complex figure pose. See, for instance, the Amazon attacking 'Kapaneus' in the Piraeus relief, and the rock on to which the Greek in the hair-pulling group steps (Figs. 6.46-47). 1540 These large and obvious rock masses, which are so closely tied to figure poses, are very similar to those seen on the sculptures of the Parthenon: compare, for example, the rock mounting blocks of W.VI.12 and W.XV.29 on the frieze and the rock seats on metopes N.31 and N.32. It is possible that on the original shield some of the background elements were high relief appliqués, like the human figures, while others were incised or chased on the main body of the shield, the effect in this case being pictorial rather than sculptural. As on the Parthenon sculptures, the most important and well documented landscape element is rock, and this seems to have been shown in several forms: a running groundline linking two figures, rocky outcrops, and steadily rising ground. The pilos-wearer and his adversary, for instance, seem to have stood on roughly level ground, represented by a running groundline of rock.1541 In the 'Antiope' group, the figure poses are intelligible if one imagines a lump of rock under the two figures: the Greek raises his right foot on to the rock, the Amazon crouches with one leg placed on this rock, while her other leg is set at a lower level. The adversaries in the axe group seem to be separated by some rock between them. In the Copenhagen version of this group, the rock is shown as a substantial mound,1542 whereas in one of the Piraeus fragments, no. 2110, the same rock has been abbreviated to a small outcrop on to which both figures step forward (Fig. 6. 60). 1543 The latter version looks less plausible, for it appears to bring the two combatants much too close together, considering their actions. In the lower part of the shield the ground seems to have been more or less level, and rocky outcrops are sufficient to explain a raised foot here and there. But, as the fight went up the shield, the ground seems to have become much hillier, as far as one can judge from the more staggered position of the adversaries and the climbing poses of certain combatants.1544 As shown above, running groundlines and rocky outcrops are both paralleled in the sculptures of the Parthenon, but the depiction of steeply rising ground used to support a large number of figures on different levels occurs only on the shield. The large format of the shield - quite unlike any of the spaces available for sculpture on the temple - allowed 1540 For the Amazon attacking 'Kapaneus' in the Piraeus relief see Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979), pl. 12; for the Greek in the hair pulling group see figs. 6. 46 and 47; Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pls. 1, 2 and 5. 1541 See the fragmentary relief from Salamis, cat. no.

Due to their shapes, the frieze and pediments of the temple are dominated by a strictly linear arrangement of figures. The same is true of many of the metopes but, despite their limiting format, the metopes do occasionally parallel some of the compositional features of the shield. A non-linear approach, with strong diagonal axes, is used, for instance, in the depiction of certain scenes of combat, with adversaries eyeing each other from different levels. Consider, for example, S.4, S.27 and S.30 from the south side Centauromachy, and several from the east and west series. In the west series the diagonal line is frequently achieved by showing an Amazon on horseback attacking a Greek who has fallen to the ground, while in the east series it is achieved by having one standing figure battle with a figure down on his knees. There is also the unique composition of the metope E.6, in which the rocky landscape dominates almost half of the available space. Such a composition surely draws on ideas similar to those used for the shield composition. On the shield the background to the figures was used to suggest not only different levels of terrain but also different planes. This is clearly indicated in the arrangement of the group compositions. A good example is the group of three: the Greek is not only placed lower than his adversaries, but he is also shown as nearer to the viewer. This is partly achieved through the poses of the three figures, for while the lower Amazon is seen in full back view, with her head turning to her left as she observes the Greek, and the Greek is almost fully frontal, though he turns his head to his left to watch the Amazon, the upper Amazon is shown in three-quarter back view. The curving surface of the shield must have accentuated the depth given to this group composition by the pose of the upper Amazon. For while the crouching Greek stood near the centre of the shield, the two Amazons were set further towards its edge. In this manner Pheidias ingeniously made the shape of the shield work to his advantage. Another example is the group of six. In the central plane are the stone-thrower and the climbing Amazon who look at each other, one from above, one from below. Further away are the descending Amazon and the seated Amazon at the outer edge of the shield, while nearer and lower than the stone-thrower, are the collapsed Amazon and the other seated Amazon situated above the central Gorgoneion. This last Amazon represents a further threat to the stone-thrower, which he will have to deal with when he has finished with the climbing Amazon who occupies him at present. On the Parthenon frieze an impression of depth is skilfully created by the complicated pattern of overlapping figures, particularly in the cavalcade scenes at the west ends of the north and south sides. But on the shield overlapping figures seem to have been carefully avoided. The only exception appears to be the helper group, where the lower legs and part of the arms of the helper are hidden by the body of the man he is carrying away from the fight (Fig. 6.49). Unfortunately, there is little hard evidence to show exactly how the background helped to add to the impression of depth of field, though it is easy to imagine a combination of very low relief background elements being used along with much higher relief elements to create such an effect. This is certainly what was done on some of the Piraeus reliefs: see the copy of the hair-pulling group showing rock in the foreground, walls in the middle ground and columns behind the walls.1545 Low relief walls also figure behind the pilos-wearer in one of the Piraeus copies.1546 Interestingly, it is again amongst 1545 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 2.

Take, for example, metope N.2, in which the high relief figures in the composition are set against a low relief background showing the prow of a ship and a landing ladder. These elements set the scene while at the same time adding a pictorial quality to the composition. It seems probable that the shield was not dissimilar in form. It seems reasonable to suppose that, along with the rocks, the walls, towers and columns of some of the Piraeus copies probably do replicate something of the original shield background design. The unusual representation of a wall in an Amazonomachy scene on a volute krater by the Niobid painter makes this seem likely.1547 The juxtaposition of steep rocks and architectural features is eminently appropriate in such a scene, for it suggests a location in Athens for the battle, and this in turn identifies the scene very clearly as the Athenian Amazonomachy. If this is correct, then Pheidias was using the background not simply to support figure poses but also to indicate locality and thus to help identify the scene depicted. As observed above, good examples of such a use of background elements can be found both on the Parthenon metopes and pediments, though perhaps not on the frieze. From the evidence of the Piraeus copies it would appear that the walls and column tops figured towards the bottom of the composition, where the ground was less hilly, and that they gave way to rocky hillside above. Firm evidence for architectural elements in the upper parts of the composition is as yet lacking. In her reconstruction of the background of the shield, Harrison goes considerably further than this, trying to demonstrate that the shield background is a topographical depiction of the slopes of the Akropolis.1548 For her reconstruction (Fig. 6.40) she uses the evidence of the Piraeus reliefs, coupled with a close examination of the figure poses. In addition, she draws on other sources, both sculptural and literary; these do not provide direct evidence for the shield, but they do give interesting and possibly valid parallels. Harrison turns to Assyrian reliefs and the later examples seen on Lycian reliefs for parallels for city siege scenes.1549 She gives examples from these of the depiction of scaling ladders, walls, torches, a gate, the city moat and even the pediment of a temple. She includes all these in her reconstruction, finding support for their presence in various of the figure poses. For example, the climbing poses of the archer's and the stone-thrower's opponents are said to be suitable for people climbing ladders, while the seated Amazon above the central gorgoneion is reconstructed holding a torch in her left hand, and the lower of the two Amazons in the group of three is seen as climbing a cliff. It is difficult to know how far to follow Harrison's reconstruction, even if it is probably correct in broad outline, as many scholars believe. The parallels she makes are very interesting, though there is as yet no direct evidence to prove that they apply to the shield. Concerning Harrison's view that the battle took place on the slopes of the Akropolis, it should be noted that there is no literary evidence to support this view, although a city setting is likely considering Aeschylus' reference, in Eumenides , lines 685-86, to the Amazonian camp on the Areopagus, and the depiction of walls and columns on some of the Piraeus copies. Harrison seeks confirmation for the background she creates from the figure poses but, as shown in Athena Parthenos section 3, concerning the shield, there is 1547 See Arias (1980) 5 Iff. 1548 Harrison (1981) 294-311. 1549 Harrison (1981) 298ff.</page><page sequence="627">612 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS little evidence for the details of some of the figure poses she reconstructs and about four of the figures she includes probably did not feature on the shield. Therefore, to argue in detail from the figure types does not provide evidence which is as strong as Harrison maintains. Take, for example, the lower of the two Amazons in the group of three; Harrison claims that she is climbing a cliff, but a close examination of the arm positions of both this figure and her companion suggests that they were preparing to hurl spears at the Greek hiding behind his shield. Harrison stresses, no doubt rightly, the intended parallel between the Amazonian attack of mythology and the Persian attack of recent history. She restores a torch in the left hand of the Amazon seated above the central Gorgoneion,1550 and since she believes in an Akropolis setting for the scene and interprets the torch held by the Amazon as a direct reference to the burning of the Akropolis sanctuaries by the Persians, she suggests that Pheidias included a temple as part of the background at the top of the shield. But there is no direct evidence for a temple. And one may question how appropriate a temple would be in a scene supposedly set in the dim and distant past, when Theseus was champion of the Athenians. To cast doubts on an Akropolis setting for the scene has strong implications for its interpretation. If Harrison sees the battle as taking place on the slopes of the Akropolis, with the Amazons fighting their way up, then she must also interpret the Greek who is about to hurl a boulder, at the top of the composition, as being on the defensive and believe that Pheidias chose to show a moment in the battle when it was not entirely clear who would be victorious. But if the battle is taking place on the slopes of the Areopagus - the site of the Amazon encampment, according to Aeschylus, Eum. 685-89 - then the Greek throwing the boulder would be on the offensive, and the whole scene could be interpreted as depicting the expulsion of the Amazons from their Athenian stronghold. Although the number of casualties on each side appears to be about equal, the implication is that a Greek victory is at hand. An analysis of the use of landscape elements on the Parthenos shield and the sculptures of the Parthenon reveals that similar ideas were being experimented with in these works. Most important for the development of Greek art was the use, albeit in a limited way, of such elements to support complex figure poses, to add pictorial interest to a scene, and to help identify the location of a scene. In these respects, as well as in the large amount of space allowed for the background, and the attempt to create different planes as well as different levels of terrain, the Parthenos shield probably came closest to the metopes, sculptures of precisely similar date. In the metopes landscape elements seem to have been both more obvious and more varied than in the frieze or pediments, though the extent to which they were used remains difficult to gauge given the loss of the paintwork. As far as the shield is concerned, the Piraeus reliefs give us some indication of the background setting, but again it is possible that more details appeared in very low relief or even incised on the shield and that these have not been preserved in the copies. It is reasonable to conclude that the shield background consisted of a combination of natural and architectural features suggesting a location for the battle on one of the hills of Athens. The background would have been executed in various ways, including high relief, low relief and incised details. It would have been clearly visible and it would have formed an essential part of the composition, occupying much of the surface of the shield and providing a suitable context for the human protagonists. 1550 Stefanidou-Tiveriou (1979) pl. 22.</page><page sequence="628">PARTHENON 613 5.

FAMILY AND ENTOURAGE Pheidias was regarded by both Greeks and Romans as the finest sculptor of the 5th century BC and his name is associated by tradition with the greatest artistic monument of ancient Greece: the Parthenon. Yet the details of his life are obscure and no original work of his has so far been identified with certainty. Pausanias states that the inscription on the Olympian Zeus recorded that the artist was an Athenian citizen, the son of Charmides.1551 Charmides is otherwise unknown, but it is possible that Pheidias came from a family of artists, for tradition recalls that he had at least one brother, or less plausibly a nephew, who was a painter. According to Pausanias and Pliny, Pheidias 's famous contemporary, Panainos, was his brother, and he collaborated on some of his projects, notably the Zeus at Olympia.1552 Plutarch mentions another brother, Pleistainetos, also a painter, but this man is otherwise unknown and the name may well be a doublet for Panainos.1553 Perhaps Pheidias too started out as a painter, as Pliny states.1554 The suggestion is not implausible, for the inner surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos is thought to have been adorned with a painting. Furthermore, the relief Amazonomachy on the outer surface of the shield, which can be reconstructed with some confidence, betrays an intimate knowledge of the figure poses and the landscape elements of early Classical painting. The very subject of the Athenian Amazonomachy, to which Pheidias had recourse again on the throne decorations of his Zeus at Olympia, had first been popularized in Athens by wall paintings made for the Theseion and the Stoa Poikile in around 470 BC and around 460 BC, respectively. The Centauromachy of the Parthenon metopes of the south side, showing the battle taking place at the wedding feast, also follows the early Classical version of the story which may have originated in the Theseion mural painting of this subject, a work perhaps attributable to Polygnotos.1555 There are other suggestions of a debt to painting in the metopes of the Parthenon, and these are commented upon in section 4 of the chapter on the Parthenon. According to Pliny, Pheidias flourished in the 83rd Olympiad, that is 448-445 BC.1556 This date coincides with one of his major works, namely the Athena Parthenos, which was begun at this time, though not finished until 438 BC. It also coincides with the beginning of work on the Parthenon, with which Pheidias was most probably involved.

After 438 BC, however, he went to Olympia and, as the workshop finds suggest, he probably spent most of the 430s BC there, making the Zeus and other works, such as the Aphrodite Ourania and the Anadoumenos. Thus the central years of Pheidias's life can be mapped out quite clearly: he spent at least twenty years in Athens, followed by a good spell in Olympia, when he was at the height of his powers. Diodorus Siculus places Pheidias within the Pentekontaetea, the fifty years between the Persian and the Peloponnesian Wars and this seems to accord well with what is known of his works.1557 Some of the early commissions mentioned in the sources were important works, so he must already have acquired a good reputation as a sculptor by the early 460s BC. One is probably not wide of the mark in suggesting that he was born in the decade after the turn of the century and died a little before 430 BC. There is little in the sources about Pheidias's training as a sculptor, though it seems certain that he was introduced early to the art of bronze statuary. One tradition, found in Tzetzes, says that he was taught by the famous Peloponnesian artist, Hageladas of Argos.1558 The lively sculptural tradition of this Peloponnesian city and its possibly more peaceful environment during Pheidias's formative years make the idea of such a training attractive. This theory, however, cannot be substantiated by any early source and it is perhaps rendered suspicious by the claim made in the sources that Hageladas also trained other stars of the 5th century BC, including Myron and Polykleitos. Harrison points out that Hageladas was responsible for two bronze statue groups dedicated at Delphi in the early Classical period.1559 One of these showed a group of horses and captive women won from the Messapians by the Tarentines, who made this dedication. The other work, another Tarentine dedication, this time made with Onatas of Aegina, showed foot-soldiers and horsemen, along with the dead king of the Iapygians, Opis, and the heroes Taras and Phalanthos - Phalanthos who founded the city of Tarentum and Taras who gave his name to it. It seems probable that these groups, which must have been made not very long before Pheidias was working on his Marathon group at Delphi, influenced Pheidias's work, with regard both to the technical problems associated with making large groups of hollow cast bronzes, and to the design of the group. It is perhaps this influence which led to the idea that Pheidias was the pupil of Hageladas. Pheidias may even have worked as an assistant to Hageladas at Delphi, as Harrison suggests.1560 According to another tradition, Pheidias was trained by an Athenian called Hegias, about whom virtually nothing is known.1561 If he is to be equated with the artist Hegesias, then he was a bronze-worker who belonged to the generation before Pheidias, and was active in the late Archaic period. Perhaps the obscurity of Hegias, his name remembered only because of the fame of his pupil Pheidias, renders this tradition more persuasive. But 1557 Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist.

LV.l.</page><page sequence="634">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 619 Pliny mentions Hegias twice and Hageladas three times and he never connects either of them with Pheidias.1562 In Athens, Pheidias clearly came into contact with the leading sculptors of his day, many of whom worked on the Periklean building projects. In particular, the sources mention that he trained the Parian Agorakritos, a man he especially helped and favoured; later tradition says Agorakritos was his lover.1563 Their styles were undoubtedly close, for several works by Agorakritos were thought to be by Pheidias. Alkamenes too was sometimes called the pupil of Pheidias. He was younger than Pheidias, and he outlived him by a number of years. There are stories of rivalry between both Alkamenes and Agorakritos and Alkamenes and Pheidias. Pheidias is also supposed to have come into competition with Polykleitos of Argos, Kresilas and Phradmon for a dedication at the Ephesian Artemision. This was a bronze statue of an Amazon, probably made in the 430s BC. According to Pliny, other rivals - presumably in his early days - were Kritios, Nesiotes, Hegias, Hageladas, and Alkamenes, perhaps an older relative of his pupil by the same name.1564 He also worked with Kolotes and possibly with Theokosmos of Megara. Kolotes specialized in the chryselephantine technique. Pausanias says it was he who made the chryselephantine table in the Heraion at Olympia, which was used as a stand for the crowns of the victors at the games.1565 It is not unlikely that he learnt his art from Pheidias, and that he even worked on the Zeus at Olympia with Pheidias.1566 Theokosmos was said to have started an acrolithic copy of Pheidias 's Zeus for the temple of Zeus at Megara, a work which was still not finished at the time when the project had to be abandoned because of the Peloponnesian War.1567 This copy must have been under construction when the original statue was barely finished. Whether Pheidias really worked with Theokosmos on this statue, as Pausanias says, or whether he advised Theokosmos and perhaps taught him how to go about such a project is not known. As the undoubted expert in the field, it is clear that his knowledge and experience would have been highly valued. Whether or not Pheidias was interested in politicians, they were clearly interested in him. Public sculpture, as well as painting, provided obvious vehicles for the transmission of political statements and propaganda, and politicians were eager to make use of them. From the fragments of the detailed accounts published for the Athena Promachos, the Athena Parthenos, as well as for the Parthenon itself - which were set up for public scrutiny on the Akropolis - it is clear that Pheidias 's greatest Athenian works were carried out in the time of radical democracy, after the reforms of Ephialtes in 462/461 BC. Pheidias 's friendship with Perikles is mentioned several times in the sources and it is said by some to have earned him much jealousy among the people of Athens and even to have brought him to a bad end.1568 Plutarch paints a vivid picture of Perikles undertaking the 1562 Pliny, NH 34.49 and 78, concerning Hegias and NH 34.49; 55; and 57, concerning Hageladas. 1563 So Tzetzes, Chil VII.921-28. 1564 Pliny, NH 34.49. 1565 Pausanias, V.20.1-2. 1566 So Pliny, NH 35.54 and 34.87. 1567 Pausanias, 1.40.4. 1568 So Plutarch, Per. 31.</page><page sequence="635">620 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS great Athenian building programme, as if it was his personal project, with Pheidias as his chief overseer, artist and adviser.1569 There is a degree of exaggeration here which does not quite accord with historical fact. For Perikles's leading position in the political scene at Athens from the 450s BC depended upon the continuing support of the voting demos, and all public works had to be approved by the people and supervised by elected and accountable boards of epistatai. Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that it was Perikles's leadership which inspired the building programme and ensured that it was well under way before the death of the great statesman in 429 BC. The fact that Pheidias won at least two of the most prestigious commissions of the time - the colossal bronze 'Promachos' and the extravagantly expensive Parthenos - proves how highly regarded he was as an artist in the eyes of the Athenians, and particularly perhaps in the eyes of Perikles. But Pheidias himself was an artist, not a politician, and he accepted commissions from various quarters. For the aristocrat Kimon, he made the important Marathon monument at Delphi. It is not known whether the group dates to before the ostracism of Kimon in 461 BC, when Kimon was at the height of his power and popularity, thanks to his victory at Eurymedon, or to the period between his recall to Athens in around 455 BC and his death in 449 BC, when he again found his way to the centre of the political stage by his involvement in the negotiations for the five year truce between Sparta and Athens which was signed in 452/451 BC under Perikles. Kluwe's view, that the Marathon monument was a private dedication by Kimon dating from the 450s BC, has been generally accepted.1570 Harrison, however, has recently challenged this idea.1571 If Pausanias is right that the monument was made from a tithe of the spoils of Marathon, then this implies that it was a public dedication.1572 Following Castriota, Harrison takes it to be one of the official Kimonian monuments, like the Athenian Theseion and perhaps the Stoa Peisianaktios, as the Stoa Poikile had originally been named.1573 The inclusion in the Delphi group of Kimon's dead father Miltiades, the general who lead the Athenians to victory at Marathon, alongside Apollo and Athena, implies Miltiades 's heroization. Such a statement surely made better sense at the time when Kimon was at the height of his power and popularity, that is, after his victory at Eurymedon in around 468 BC, when the Persian fleet was completely destroyed and when victory over the Persians was a topical issue. At this time, the strong political overtones of the monument, concerning Kimon's own achievements and abilities, would also have met with the greatest approval. In terms of Pheidias 's career, it would come as no surprise to find that, before making his important and colossal Athenian works, Pheidias had already found favour amongst the most powerful men of his day and had proved his worth in a major commission. A central problem in our appreciation of Pheidias is the degree to which he was responsible for the sculptures of the Parthenon - probably the most accomplished and influential works of the high Classical period, and amongst the most beautiful Greek originals to have survived. Apart from the testimony of Plutarch, there is no evidence in the sources that Pheidias was involved in the making of the Parthenon sculptures, though 1569 Plutarch, Per. 13. 1570 Kluwe (1965) 2 Iff. 1571 Harrison (1996) 26. 1572 Pausanias, X.10.1. 1573 Castriota (1992) 81-82; Harrison (1996) 18-19.</page><page sequence="636">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 621 it is clear that Pheidias was working on the Akropolis for much of the time that the Parthenon was being built and he probably trained some of the sculptors who worked on the building. The Athena Parthenos, which was undoubtedly the work of Pheidias, is well enough known from written descriptions and replicas to allow it to be compared in some detail with the sculptural remains of the Parthenon. The correlation between these works surely provides the necessary confirmation that Pheidias was closely involved in the planning and design of both the building and the statue. Not only was there a strong thematic coordination between the temple sculptures and the temple image, with many cross-references and parallels linking the works together, but there was also a consistency of style which bound the works still closer. This is clear in the depiction of drapery, figure types and poses, as well as in the use of landscape elements, all of which are discussed in the chapter on the Parthenon. The interest shown in the depiction of movement and transient moments in time is another common feature, and certain unusual compositional devices are found repeated in both groups of works. The innovative style of the Parthenon sculptures represents such a break with the 'Severe style' that went before that it points to the work of a genius, as Boardman says, and there is little reason to doubt that this was anyone other than Pheidias.1574 Even if Plutarch has exaggerated Pheidias's role, he may well be right that Pheidias played a special part in the creation of the Parthenon sculptures. Of all the works attributed to Pheidias, only five have the backing of several sources. These are the Zeus at Olympia, the Athena Lemnia, the Athena Parthenos, the great bronze Athena on the Akropolis, and the Amazon at Ephesos. The first two were signed by Pheidias, and the third had the name of the sculptor inscribed on a stele kept on the Akropolis. Two other works which were probably signed, and which Pausanias saw, are the Anadoumenos in Olympia and the Marathon monument at Delphi. The Marathon monument bore a dedicatory inscription, which may have given the artist's name, and the Anadoumenos is mentioned by Pausanias in a passage about Olympian victory statues which relies heavily on the accompanying dedications for information. The Athena Areia at Plataia and the Aphrodite Ourania at Elis can probably be added to the list of authentic works too. They both claim at least a couple of independent sources attributing the work to Pheidias. The acrolithic Athena Areia was partly made of Pentelic marble, which at least suggests an Attic sculptor, and the temple which housed the statue had paintings by Polygnotos of Thasos, an artist favoured by Kimon, for whom Pheidias too is known to have worked. It is also tempting and not improbable to believe that while in the vicinity of Olympia Pheidias was asked to make another chryselephantine statue, the Aphrodite Ourania. Beyond these works, one is on difficult ground. Many attributions are known to be wrong, several are doubtful, yet others are very difficult to relate to any remaining statue types because of the lack of descriptions, and some are made with obvious hesitation by the sole source on the subject. These works are discussed in section 5, below. Amongst the earlier works to be attributed to Pheidias belong the Athena Areia at Plataia and, perhaps, the shadowy Athena at Pellene. The last mentioned was said by Pausanias to predate Pheidias's Athenas on the Akropolis as well as the Athena at Plataia. The earliest of Pheidias's Akropolis Athenas was the great bronze Athena, which was most probably made in the 450s BC. The sanctuary of Athena at Plataia, along with its new temple image, were paid for, according to Plutarch, with the spoils allocated to the Plataians after the Battle of Plataia in 479 BC. It seems probable that if Pheidias was the 1574 Boardman (1985a) 92.</page><page sequence="637">622 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS artist, the Athena Areia was made a good deal later than 479 BC, though it is not known how much later. As mentioned above, there is some disagreement about the date of the Marathon Monument at Delphi, but a date in the 460s BC seems likely. Statue types which are often linked with Pheidias on stylistic grounds and which may belong to the earlier phase of his career include the Apollo Kassel and the Tiber Apollo. The most productive years of Pheidias's working life were spent first in Athens and then in Olympia. In Athens he produced the great bronze Athena and the Athena Parthenos, and he was intimately involved in the design of the Parthenon sculptures. During this period he probably also produced several lesser works amongst which may have been the portrait statue of Anakreon, identified in a statue type preserved in Copenhagen.1575 The Hermes Ludovisi would also belong to this period. Another important work which probably belongs to this period is the Athena Lemnia, which is usually dated between 451^47 BC. Of all Athenian sculptors, Pheidias must have been the most sought after and his success is clear both from the importance of the commissions he won in his native city, as well as from his wealth, which Plato alludes to once in passing.1576 It was in Olympia that Pheidias produced his greatest masterpiece, the chryselephantine Zeus. It seems probable that Pheidias's period in Olympia also saw the creation of the Aphrodite Ourania in Elis and the Anadoumenos. The Olympian phase of his career was probably the last, starting some time after 439 BC and continuing until about 432 BC. An important work of the 430s BC is the bronze Amazon, mentioned above. This statue was made for a dedication at the Ephesian Artemision which consisted of four or five Amazons by leading contemporary artists. Whether the statue was made in Attica or whether Pheidias travelled to Ephesos is not known. 1575 Pausanias mentions the work in 1.25.1. 1576 Plato, Meno , 91d.</page><page sequence="638">2. TRIAL AND DEATH Concerning the end of Pheidias's life, the main sources are Aristophanes, Pax , 605ff., and its scholia, the Ephoros-based accounts of Diodorus Siculus, XII.39f., and Aristodemos, FgrH. 104.16. 1-2, and Plutarch, Per. 31-32. Aristophanes was of course alive at the time when the events took place. Diodorus and Aristodemos were drawing upon the 4th century BC historian Ephoros for their evidence. They also quote the relevant Aristophanic passage as confirmation of their statements. While the beginning of Plutarch's version is very close to that of Diodorus, other details in his text seem to have come from a collection of legal cases to which Plutarch had access.1577 Taken together, these sources draw an unambiguous picture of the main lines of the episode, leaving little room for uncertainty. Nevertheless, the subject of Pheidias's end continues to cause a certain amount of controversy due to the fact that the scholiasts commenting on the Aristophanic passage give a very different story of what happened. Because they both claim to be quoting the 4th century BC historian Philochoros, who is known to have consulted Attic archives, their testimony is regarded by some as significant.1578 Aristophanes sketches out the story in broad outline but he does not give any details, as if the story was very well known to his audience. The important points which emerge from his text are that Pheidias acted wrongly, TTpáÇaç Ka kw g, and that he suffered a punishment which made Perikles fear he might share his fate, c|)oßr|0€is 'ir' [leTÓaxoi Tfļs TÚXT1S. For this reason, and before he should himself suffer any evil, it pi v TraGeîv ti ôeivòv airróç, Perikles decided to risk war with Sparta by imposing sanctions on Megara. Aristophanes 's words indicate that Pheidias was judged guilty of some dishonesty which could implicate Perikles, that his punishment was an unpleasant one and that the episode took place around the time of the Megarian crisis. Thus, Pheidias's troubles are set shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, in about 433-32 BC. Because Aristophanes is a writer of comedy and because he is known to have invented outrageous stories when it suited his comic purpose, he is not taken seriously by some scholars, but in this case his allusions to Pheidias, which are not funny, fit in well with those of the Ephoros-based writers. Diodorus Siculus, Aristodemos and Plutarch all confirm that Pheidias was accused of wrong-doing in Athens and found guilty, that he was punished and that Perikles tried to avoid coming under attack himself by creating a political emergency by means of the Megarian decree. These sources therefore agree that the events took place around 433-32 BC. Diodorus and Plutarch make it clear that the trial of Pheidias was politically motivated and that it aimed indirectly at Perikles himself. All three sources agree that the accusation levelled at Pheidias centred on the accounts of the Athena Parthenos and that Perikles, in his role as one of the overseers of the project, was also in danger of attack concerning this matter. Diodorus and Aristodemos explain Aristophanes 's rather vague 1577 Plutarch, Arisi. 26.3. 1578 See Mansfeld (1979) 39-69; Ostwald (1986) 192, 194-95. 623</page><page sequence="639">624 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS phrase TTpaÇaç kcikws in terms of financial dishonesty, saying, respectively, that Pheidias withheld large amounts of sacred money, TToXXà tûv íepwv xP^IM-^tcov è'xovTa, and that he was accused of peculation, em voacļHaļiou. Diodorus adds that Perikles was also accused of stealing sacred property, lepoauXia. Plutarch says Pheidias was accused of stealing gold intended for the statue, but then he adds that the thefts could not be proved, since the statue had been constructed in such a way that all the gold could be removed and weighed if necessary, but that nevertheless, and prompted by jealousy, the people condemned Pheidias and sentenced him. Aristodemos states that Pheidias was convicted, but neither he nor Diodorus give much information about the case. Diodorus reports that at the instigation of Perikles's enemies, Pheidias was accused by some of the men who had worked with him on the Parthenos project. Plutarch specifically names a foreigner called Menon, who went and sat as a suppliant at the Altar of the Twelve Gods in the Athenian Agora, saying that in exchange for impunity he could prove that Pheidias had acted dishonestly when making the Parthenos. He was prompted to do so by Perikles's enemies, who had spotted a means of attacking Perikles himself if Pheidias could be incriminated over the Parthenos accounts. This accusation was received and put before the Ekklesia. Pheidias was then put into prison and Menon was rewarded with exemption from taxation and personal safety. It was normal practice to put the accused into prison as soon as the accusation was accepted by the Ekklesia, and to keep him there until he appeared before a regular tribunal, as chosen by the Ekklesia. In due course, the tribunal would judge the case and, if necessary, decide upon the punishment. Plutarch's suggestion that Menon was rewarded for his troubles suggests that people were confident that Pheidias would be judged guilty. From the extent of his rewards, along with the great publicity that no doubt surrounded the trial because of Menon 's unusual behaviour in sitting as a suppliant on the altar in the Agora, it seems very probable that Menon's accusation was heavily influenced by political machinations. Plutarch alone completes the story, adding that Pheidias died in prison either through illness or because he was poisoned. If these sources are correct in reporting that Pheidias stood accused of stealing gold from the Athena Parthenos project, that is sacred money, then the punishment would indeed have been severe: it would have meant the death penalty. Plutarch leads one to believe that, although judged guilty, Pheidias died in prison before the sentence was carried out. It does not seem unlikely that Pheidias 's friendship with Perikles aroused people's jealousy in Athens, and, further, that Perikles's enemies had no scruples in attacking his friends and entourage in an attempt to discredit Perikles himself. Plutarch records that at about the same time as the trial of Pheidias, two other friends of Perikles, Aspasia and Anaxagoras, came under attack too. Diodorus mentions the accusation of Anaxagoras, and he says that Perikles himself was in danger of attack in the Pheidias affair. Plutarch recognizes the danger to Perikles in the Pheidias affair and records that Perikles was actually brought to trial a few years later, at the end of his life and after the outbreak of war {Per. 35.4). Given this situation, it is quite possible that the underlying motive for accusing Pheidias of dishonesty was a political attack against Perikles who, as one of the overseers of the Parthenos project, would be guilty of negligence or, worse, collusion if Pheidias was condemned. Doubt has been cast on all these stories, concerning who was brought to trial and, if so, when, and on what grounds. It has already been shown that there is evidence for the trial and condemnation of Pheidias around 433-32 BC, and that it includes one contemporary source. Despite much controversy surrounding it, the attack</page><page sequence="640">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 625 against Anaxagoras can be shown to be a historical reality too, for it is alluded to in at least one independent and serious source: Plato, Apologia , 26d. Plato's reference to Anaxagoras would be meaningless in the context if an accusation had not been brought against him. In addition, the reference demonstrates that the accusation was twofold: that he did not believe in the gods and that he taught about the heavens, the very subjects of the much-doubted decree of Diopeithes recorded by Plutarch.1579 Plutarch does not refer to a trial in Per. 32, but in Nicias, 23.3 Plutarch attests that Perikles managed to rescue Anaxagoras from imprisonment. The trial of Aspasia is more difficult to verify and to take seriously, partly because it is not mentioned by Diodorus or Aristodemos and partly because Plutarch records that she was accused by the comic poet Hermippos and that she was acquitted only after Perikles shed many tears at her trial. The comic element in this story has made many scholars doubt that it stems from historical reality rather than from a scene in a comedy.1580 Nevertheless, the accusation of impiety brought against Aspasia by Hermippos (along with the allegation that she procured freeborn women for Perikles), is grave enough to make it credible, particularly as there seems to have been a religious element in all the trials relating to Perikles and his friends, as Bauman demonstrates.1581 In the case of Anaxagoras, the religious nature of the accusations made against him has already been noted. Plutarch does not specify the reason why Aspasia was accused of impiety but this was surely related to the fact that she was a courtesan and that she was accused of acting as a procurer for Perikles. Plutarch reports that when the accusation that Pheidias had stolen gold from the Athena Parthenos failed, it was the people's jealousy that nevertheless led to the conviction of Pheidias, for Pheidias had made portraits of himself and Perikles on the shield of the Parthenos. Bauman is of the opinion that this may well have been regarded as an impious act and, as such, an important element in the case, even if Pheidias was not actually charged with impiety.1582 As to Perikles himself, in the Ephoros-based accounts as well as in Aristophanes, he is consistently shown to be in danger of implication in the Pheidias affair because of his role as epistates in the Parthenos project. The danger was avoided for some time by the Megarian crisis and the outbreak of war with Sparta but, as Bauman argues convincingly, it reared its head again in around 430 BC when Perikles was finally brought to trial. Plato, Górgias , 576a, confirms that the accusation made against Perikles was that of theft. Perikles was condemned, deposed from his office of stratēģos and heavily fined.1583 A controversial element associated with the accusation and trial of Perikles is Plutarch's report of the decree of Drakontides and the amendment of Hagnon, which he mentions in Per. 32, in relation to the request for a special audit of the accounts for the Athena Parthenos at the time of the accusation made against Pheidias. The decree of Drakontides proposed to treat the theft as tepoauXia, a religious charge with very severe repercussions for those found guilty. This is the offence mentioned by Diodorus. Hagnon' s amendment, however, managed to ensure that the case 1579 Derenne (1930) 22; Mansfeld (1979) 32; Bauman (1990) 39. 1580 See Bauman (1990) 38 and notes. 1581 Bauman (199) 37^2. 1582 Bauman (1990) 37 and n. 24. 1583 Plutarch, Per. 35.3-4; Diodorus, XII.45.4; Thucydides, II.65.3.</page><page sequence="641">626 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS was treated in the normal way, resulting in a less severe penalty.1584 Bauman suggests that the change of mood displayed by the Athenians in the acceptance first of the ultra-religious decree of Drakontides and then of the more tolerant amendment by Hagnon shows that a period of time must have elapsed between the two, the period of time plausibly corresponding to that between the first attacks made against Perikles and his entourage and Perikles's own trial. The decree was an attempt to make the crime a religious one but in this case it failed, due to the help of Perikles's friend and supporter Hagnon. Turning to the scholia on Aristophanes, Pax 605-06, a rather different picture is painted of the last part of Pheidias's life. The first scholiast reports Philochoros as saying that, in the archonship of Pythodoros, the Athena Parthenos was set up, Pheidias was tried for falsifying the accounts for the ivory used to make the scales, that he fled to Elis where he was given the commission to make the Zeus at Olympia and, when he had finished the statue, the Eleians put him to death. The first scholiast adds that, seven years later, in the archonship of Skythodoros, Philochoros says that the Megarians complained to Sparta about the Athenian economic sanctions. The scholiast reports that, according to some, when Pheidias was convicted of defrauding the city, Perikles took fright at the possibility of being implicated in the affair as one of the epistatai of the project and so he proposed the Megarian decree and this led to war. But the scholiast comments that the suspicion against Perikles seems absurd since seven years elapsed between the Pheidias affair and the start of the war. The second scholiast reports Philochoros as saying that, in the archonship of Pythodoros, after Pheidias had completed the statue, he stole gold from the serpents and for this he was punished with exile. He then went to Elis, where he made the statue of Zeus, and he was accused by the Eleians of embezzlement and condemned to death. Then Perikles became afraid as he was one of the overseers of the Athena Parthenos and he started the war so that no-one would have time to check the accounts. At first glance, the two scholiasts seem to agree pretty well about what happened and the first scholiast clearly states that he thought there was a seven-year gap between Pheidias's trial and the outbreak of the war. Thus, it would appear that the scholiasts thought that Pheidias's trial, for some theft associated with the Athena Parthenos, took place as soon as the statue was completed and that Pheidias then fled to Elis, made the Zeus at Olympia and later died at the hands of the Eleians. In favour of this view is, firstly, the fact that both the scholiasts claim that they are quoting a serious historian, namely Philochoros. Secondly, it seems likely that the accounts of the Athena Parthenos were verified shortly after work was completed. All accounts for public works had to be submitted within the thirty days after an official left office. After this period questions about those accounts could no longer be raised. In addition, it is a well established fact that when Pheidias completed the Athena Parthenos, he went to Elis and took on the commission for the Zeus at Olympia. Therefore, if he was accused of theft in 438 BC, he must have died several years later in order to have had time to complete the statue of Zeus. This in itself does not disprove that Pheidias did not stand trial in Athens until after he had completed the Zeus at Olympia. As to the seven-year gap between the completion of the Athena Parthenos and the verification of the accounts, it is important to recall that 432 BC coincides with the completion of the Parthenon building project. Perhaps it was not until the temple was finished that all the accounts related to the project were due for 1584 Concerning the decree of Drakontides and Hagnon' s amendment, see the relevant notes to Plutarch, Per. 31-32, in volume 2.

Finally, as will be suggested in the last part of this discussion, there are strong reasons for doubting that one should believe that the two scholiasts are quoting Philochoros accurately and, therefore, that their statements outweigh the evidence of Aristophanes and the Ephoros-based versions of the story. A superficial examination of the two scholia is sufficient to reveal that, despite the scholiasts' claims, some of the material cannot possibly have been quoted exactly from Philochoros. While the first archon to be mentioned by the first scholiast should not have been Pythodoros but Theodoros, the second should have been Pythodoros, rather than the unknown Skythodoros.1585 While the second scholiast dates everything he recounts, including the accusation, trial and sentencing of Pheidias, to the archonship of Pythodoros, that is to 432 BC, the first scholiast claims to quote material dated to two different years, 438 BC and 432 BC, and he places the accusation of Pheidias in 438 BC. Secondly, whereas the first scholiast states that Pheidias was accused of falsifying the accounts for the ivory used to make scales, the second scholiast states that he was accused of stealing gold from the serpents. Clearly these statements cannot all be accurate quotes from Philochoros. The second scholiast says that Pheidias was punished with exile by the Athenians, according to Philochoros, and the first scholiast mentions exile too. But this would certainly not have been the Athenian punishment for theft or embezzlement, so this too is unlikely to come from Philochoros. Both the scholiasts agree that Pheidias was put to death by the Eleians but, while the first scholiast gives no explanation for this action, the second scholiast says it was because Pheidias was found guilty of a new case of embezzlement concerning the Zeus at Olympia. The second scholiast's explanation sounds weak and implausible because it merely repeats what was supposed to have happened in Athens. And if one is correct in seeing a political motive behind the trial of Pheidias in Athens, then what possible motive could the Eleians have found for incriminating Pheidias after he had successfully completed the Zeus at Olympia? A closer examination of the two scholia is even more revealing. It shows that the material quoted from Philochoros is much more limited than at first appears to be the case, that this material is more accurately reported by the second scholiast than by the first, and that it largely agrees with what is recorded in the other sources, namely, that in 432 BC Pheidias was accused by the Athenians of stealing gold from the Athena Parthenos, that he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The second paragraphs of both scholia seem to be scholiasts' comments and, as such, they do not purport to record the words of Philochoros. They refer to the link seen by Aristophanes and the Ephoros-based sources (Xéyouaí ti ve ç) between the accusation of Pheidias and Perikles's proposal to enforce sanctions against Megara in his fear that he would also face trial if Pheidias was found guilty of theft in connection with the Parthenos project. In a careful study of the remaining passages, Lendle found evidence, in the use of repeated and redundant words and in the change of style, to support the theory that a large part of the parallel passages which deal with the nature of the theft, the flight to Elis and the death penalty imposed in Elis, are a later interpolation perhaps added to Philochoros's text and found there by the scholiasts.1586 As such, these passages do not deserve the credence they are generally given. Without further evidence of Philochoros's original text, they should certainly not be allowed to carry more 1585 Lendle (1955) 291-93. 1586 Lendle (1955) 284-303.

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUE The masterpieces for which Pheidias was most famous were two chryselephantine statues, the Athena Parthenos at Athens and the Zeus at Olympia. These works were admired for many reasons, not least for their colossal size and their costly materials. The ancient commentators regarded them as the high point of Pheidias 's artistic production and from the descriptions we have of them there can be no doubt that all Pheidias' s skills and artistic experience were involved in their creation. Pheidias became the acknowledged expert in this field; he taught others his art and he inspired later generations with it for centuries. He developed this speciality over many years, building up the skills he required by working not only in this medium but also with other materials and techniques. The sources indicate that Pheidias also worked successfully in bronze, producing a large figure group as well as many individual statues, at least one of which was colossal; he is also reported to have made an acrolithic statue and several marble ones. In addition, descriptions of the Parthenos and the Zeus statue show that Pheidias was highly skilled at producing complex figure groups in relief. As stated in section 1, Pliny says that Pheidias had a brother, Panainos, who was a famous painter, and that Pheidias himself started his career as a painter. This has often been doubted, but the debt to painting which is apparent in one of Pheidias 's better known works, the Amazonomachy on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, suggests that this is not unlikely. Pliny states that Pheidias painted a shield in Athens. This may be a reference to the Gigantomachy on the inner side of the same shield. The two artists mentioned in connection with Pheidias 's early training as a sculptor are Hageladas and Hegias, both of whom worked principally in bronze. From Pausanias and Pliny one is able to draw up an impressive list of works by Pheidias that were made of bronze. Pheidias seems to have made far more works in this material than in any other. This is hardly surprising for an artist of the mid-fifth century BC, when bronze was the preferred material for important statues. Well attested bronzes include the colossal bronze Athena 'Promachos' and the Amazon in Ephesos, and there is good reason to believe that the Athena Lemnia too was of bronze. Of these the most important was surely the first. Not only was it a major commission for Pheidias and a highly successful work, which remained an Athenian landmark for centuries, but it also gave Pheidias excellent experience in the creation of colossal statues. To this list one can add two works attributed to Pheidias by Pausanias: the Marathon monument in Delphi, a large dedication consisting of thirteen figures, and the Anadoumenos in Olympia which, given its context, must also have been of bronze.1587 Pausanias also saw a bronze statue of Apollo Parnopios on the Athenian Akropolis, but it was probably unsigned because Pausanias says, 'they say Pheidias made the statue' (kqi tò aya'|ia Xeyoixji OeiSiav TTOifļaai).1588 In his list of 1587 Marathon Monument in Delphi, Pausanias, X. 10. 1-2; Anadoumenos, Pausanias, VI.4.5. 1588 Pausanias, 1.24.8. 629</page><page sequence="645">630 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS Pheidias's bronze works, Pliny mentions seven statues, but most of them are very difficult to identify.1589 He includes the Amazon, an Athena that was popularly known as 'forma' - perhaps the Lemnia - a 'cliduchus', an Athena taken to Rome by A. Paullus and dedicated in the temple of the Fortune of the Day, two male figures in Greek costume, dedicated in the same temple by Catulus, and one colossal male nude. Pheidias probably employed gilded bronze for some parts of his chryselephantine compositions, in some cases for technical reasons, in others because of the sheer cost involved in using gold. In the Athena Parthenos composition, Pliny notes that art experts particularly admired the large snake at the goddess's side, and the sphinx on the top of Athena's helmet, both of which were substantial pieces, executed in the round.1590 It is likely that they were of gilded bronze. The same surely went for Athena's shield, which was approximately 5m in diameter. From the evidence of the Piraeus copies, it is probable that the shield figures were executed in fairly high relief and applied to the body of the shield, which was also decorated with background elements that were either incised or chased directly on to the shield. Pliny was particularly struck by the elaborate relief decorations of the Parthenos, which he thought showed Pheidias's ability to create great art even in the details of such a large-scale work.1591 In some of the later sources, such as Martial and Sidonius Apollinaris, Pheidias is often referred to as an engraver. From what is known of his chryselephantine statues, and from the fact that he worked a great deal in bronze, it seems plausible that he would have been an accomplished engraver as well as sculptor. Pausanias states that one of the works Pheidias made in connection with the defeat of the Persians was the acrolithic Athena Areia of Plataia.1592 The statue had a wooden core and marble face, hands and feet. It was made to stand in the temple of Athena in her sanctuary at Plataia, which had to be completely rebuilt after the Persian attacks. According to Pausanias it was a colossal work; he says it was not much smaller than the great bronze Athena in Athens but, considering the fact that the Plataian statue stood indoors, this must be an exaggeration. The money for the rebuilding work came, according to Plutarch, from the Plataian share of the spoils of the battle of Plataia in 479 BC.1593 As Pausanias explains, Plataia was famous for a local festival in honour of Hera, during which oak trees, which were hewn and dressed up as brides, were taken up Mount Cithaeron on an ox-drawn wagon and burnt on a carefully constructed wooden altar.1594 Harrison draws attention to this tradition, suggesting that the local people would have been experienced wood carvers and, therefore, well able to help Pheidias with his commission.1595 When Plutarch mentions this statue, he omits to say who created it. This is unfortunate, for it would be pleasing to have some confirmation that the statue was indeed by Pheidias, as Pausanias says. For, if this is true, then it was clearly an important work for Pheidias. The colossal size of the statue and its basically wooden form, which was gilded, make it a forerunner of 1589 Pliny, NH 34.54. 1590 Pliny, NH 36.19. 1591 Pliny, NH 36.18. 1592 Pausanias, IX.4.1. 1593 Plutarch, Ar. 20. 1594 Pausanias, IX.3.1-9. 1595 Harrison (1996) 35.</page><page sequence="646">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 631 Pheidias's later chryselephantine works. It seems that, similar to an acrolith, a chryselephantine statue consisted of a fully modelled wooden statue, to which a gold and ivory revetment was affixed. When the Zeus was moved to Constantinople in the 5th century AD, it continued to be a much admired and influential work, even though it had almost certainly lost its gold revetment by this period. This would not have been possible unless the statue beneath the gold was a complete work in itself. Another masterpiece of wood carving by Pheidias must have been the throne of the great Zeus at Olympia, which Pausanias says was inlaid with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory. Pausanias' s description shows that the throne was highly adorned with both paintings and carvings depicting Greek myths: these were on the legs, on the struts between the legs of the throne, along the sides of the seat, on the arm rests, and at the very top of the throne. Dim reflections of the throne can be seen on a coin in Florence depicting the Zeus statue as well as on the Baksy krater, perhaps. It is in the medium of gold and ivory that Pheidias created the statues for which he was best remembered. His two most famous works in this medium were, of course, the Athena Parthenos at Athens, which dates from about 448 BC to probably shortly before 438 BC and the Zeus at Olympia, which dates from the 430s BC. In addition to these works, he is said to have made an Aphrodite in Elis and an Athena in Pellene, and to have assisted Theokosmos with the Zeus at Megara, a work which was never completed. The Aphrodite at Elis is well attested and probably dates from the later part of Pheidias's career, when he was working in Olympia. As to the Athena at Pellene, Pausanias alone records this as a very early work of Pheidias. It is somewhat surprising to find the young Pheidias making a chryselephantine statue in a small Achaian town, before the Athena Areia of Plataia and the Athenian Akropolis Athenas had been made, and many scholars have argued that Pausanias 's claim is based on no more than that the statue in question was fairly ancient and chryselephantine, a technique linked with Pheidias's name. The association with . Theokosmos, which is attested only by Pausanias, may have originated simply from the close iconographical links between the Zeus at Olympia and the Zeus at Megara. Theokosmos no doubt drew many ideas for his statue from the Zeus even if Pheidias did not work on the statue directly. That Pheidias did share his expertise with others is shown by Kolotes's career. Kolotes is said to have been Pheidias's pupil and to have assisted Pheidias with the Zeus at Olympia, to have made a chryselephantine table for the temple of Hera at Olympia, and to have made a chryselephantine Athena for Elis, a work sometimes attributed to Pheidias himself.1596 The Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia must have been extremely impressive, not only because of the richness of the materials employed - which included expensive woods, silver, precious gems and coloured glass, as well as ivory and gold - but also because of their enormous size. The Athena Parthenos composition, complete with base, probably measured almost 12 metres high, and the Zeus probably measured about half a metre more. The statues consisted of a complex wooden framework over which gold and ivory were affixed, the ivory used to denote skin, and the gold used primarily for the robes. Gold was also used in the making of all the accoutrements, but, as stated above, it is likely that these were gilded rather than pure gold. Pausanias mentions the intricate patterns of flowers and animals which adorned the cloak of the Zeus at Olympia. This 1596 So Pliny, NH 35.54; Pausanias, V.20.1-2. For the attribution of the Athena at Elis to Pheidias see Pausanias, VI.26.3.</page><page sequence="647">632 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS suggests that the gold was embossed, incised or engraved. It is not known exactly how the gold for the robes of the Parthenos and the Zeus was worked, but recent theories suggest that very different techniques were used in each case. On the Parthenos, the gold consisted of small, solid plates. In the workshop at Olympia, archaeologists have found terracotta moulds for small sections of drapery, and these contain deposits of glass. The moulds aie thought to have been used for a statue approximately three times life-size, made in Olympia towards the later part of the 5th century BC. Schiering proposed that sections of moulded glass were applied over the much thinner golden drapery of a chryselephantine statue, in order to protect it.1597 Whether Schiering is correct in this theory and whether a similar approach was taken for the production of the Zeus at Olympia remains to be proved. On both statues, the bare parts of the body were covered in ivory and, as Lapatin shows, this was no simple operation on works of such colossal size.1598 He argues that ivory veneers were produced by specialists, that these were then softened, moulded to the desired shape, and then affixed with glue to the outer core of the statue. The whole process would have been extremely complex and delicate. The production of an over life-size chryselephantine statue cannot be traced earlier than the time of Pheidias. Colossal works in other media had been produced successfully and, from the mid-sixth century, Greek artists were capable of making gold and ivory statues up to life-size.1599 But it required the skill and vision of Pheidias, a century later, to combine the skills of monumental bronzeworking with those of woodworking and goldworking, as well as with techniques employed to produce furniture and even boats, in order to push the art of chryselephantine statuary to astounding new limits. Chryselephantine images on such a scale had never been seen before and their impact was far-reaching. Not only did people come from far and wide, for centuries, to admire his creations but also his works inspired commissions for chryselephantine cult statues and dedications in a number of Greek sanctuaries from the later 5th century BC onwards. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in the sources Pheidias is best remembered for his work in this domain. In the Latin sources, Pheidias is several times described as a maker of ivory statues. This is probably a short-hand way of referring to him as a maker of chryselephantine statues. The skill involved in using ivory for colossal works should not be underestimated. Juvenal makes the implausible suggestion that a private individual could own a Pheidian ivory.1600 There is no evidence to prove, or even to suggest, that he ever worked on small- scale ivories. There is the case of the little ivory Eros in Timgad, for which the 2nd century AD inscription claims Pheidian authorship, but nothing is known of the statue. Athenaios refers to a Pheidian Eros in such a way as to give the impression that the statue in question was very well known, so it seems likely that this was a subject treated by Pheidias.1601 In what manner it was treated, however, is not known for no other source alludes to the work. 1597 Schiering (1991) 138-39. 1598 Lapatin (1997) 67 Iff. 1599 For the colossal golden image of Apollo on Delos by Tektaios and Angelion, for instance, see Romano (1984) 162-89.

XIII.585 F.</page><page sequence="648">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 633 In many of the ancient sources Pheidias is referred to as a stone-carver as opposed to a metal-worker. In this way he is often contrasted with Polykleitos. Pheidias was very famous for his bronze works but there is little information in the sources about his works in marble. Pliny is so vague on the matter that he writes as if he does not know at first hand of a single marble sculpture by Pheidias. Many of the sources that make this distinction are very late, but they seem to go back to a passage in Aristotle, where Pheidias the XiGoupyóç, stone-carver, is contrasted with Polykleitos the àvôpiavTOTToiós, bronze statuary.1602 It is possible that Aristotle used the terms in a wider sense, referring primarily not to the material handled but to the technique employed: the former would signify the glyptic sculptor, carving a block of hard substance, such as marble, wood or ivory, for instance, while the latter would signify the plastic sculptor, who creates a form out of a malleable material, such as bronze or clay. In this sense, the terms would well designate Pheidias, best known as the creator of chryselephantine statues, and Polykleitos, the great bronze worker. This is certainly the distinction drawn by Dionysios of Halicarnassus.1603 Of Pheidias's recorded works in marble little is known, and in no case is the attribution strengthened by repetition in a second source. Pliny prefaces his comments on Pheidias's marble works with the comment, 'they say Pheidias sculpted marble', as if he himself could not verify this statement.1604 The one example he produces is a work of which he himself clearly has no first-hand knowledge: an Aphrodite apparently exhibited in the Porticus of Octavia in Rome. To this work he can only add vague rumours: Pheidias may have added the finishing touches to the Alkamenean Aphrodite in the Gardens, and several works passed off as those of his pupil Agorakritos may also be by Pheidias. It is also in his chapters on works in marble that Pliny gives his brief description of the relief decorations of the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos.1605 It is possible that at least some of these reliefs - those of the base - were made of gilded marble, though there is no evidence to prove this and the reliefs might equally well have been gilded bronze appliqués. Pliny does not elucidate the matter. The Parthenos justified Pheidias's preeminence amongst sculptors, a point Pliny is here making, but beyond this it remains unclear why Pliny discusses the work in this particular place. Pausanias is not much more forthcoming than Pliny on the subject of Pheidias's works in marble. He attributes to Pheidias a Mother of the Gods in Athens and the Nemesis at Rhamnous, of which the latter is now generally believed to be by Agorakritos.1606 He mentions a Hermes Pronaos in Thebes, for which the attribution sounds doubtful (XéyeTai . . .); this work was probably unsigned.1607 He also tells of an Aphrodite Ourania in Athens, but unfortunately he does not describe this work at all.1608 It is sometimes thought to be another work by Agorakritos. In addition to these works there are of course the sculptures of the Parthenon. These works are barely mentioned in the sources. Plutarch alone links them indirectly with 1602 Aristotle, Eth. Nic. VI.7. 1603 Dionysios of Halicarnassus in De Din.

It is not clear exactly what the title éui okottoç entailed but, as argued in the chapters concerning the Parthenos and the Parthenon, there are many reasons for believing that Pheidias was the designer of the Parthenon sculptures, that he trained the leading sculptors involved in their execution, and that he was the artist in charge of the works at least until his departure from Athens shortly after the completion of the Parthenos in 438 BC. The reason why these sculptural groups barely receive a mention in the extant sources is not clear, especially considering their very high quality. But it may simply be due to the fact that temple images and other free-standing statues were more highly regarded than architectural relief sculpture, no matter who created them. The brilliant style of drapery developed on the Parthenon sculptures is one of the best suited to marble carving, with its sharply-chiselled facets and its drilled grooves to create contrasts of light and shadow. If Pheidias was responsible for the marble carvings of the Parthenon, then such Classic drapery would have been one of his greatest and most significant artistic achievements. 1609 Plutarch, Per. 13.</page><page sequence="650">4. STYLE AND REPUTATION The sheer number of references to Pheidias in the literary sources, from the later 5th century BC until Byzantine times, testifies to the fame and outstanding reputation of Pheidias as an artist. His brilliance was recognized from his own day and throughout antiquity and, in certain respects, he was thought never to have been surpassed by any later artist. His works were imitated as soon as they appeared, as is clear from the case of Theokosmos's statue of Zeus at Megara, and people flocked to see them. Arrian says it was regarded as a tragedy to die without seeing the works of Pheidias, and Dio Chrysostomos says that simply to look at the Zeus at Olympia was enough to make the most care-worn person forget his woes.1610 A recurrent idea in the sources, and one which bestows the highest praise on Pheidias, is that in the field of sculpture Pheidias occupied the same place as Homer did in the field of poetry. Often he is named simply because he is so very famous, and no new information about such matters as the appearance of his works, his innovations and his style, which was clearly recognizable, can be gathered from the sources.1611 Only a careful analysis of the many texts involved, coupled with the evidence provided by copies of works which may be attributed to Pheidias, help to shed some light on these lost masterpieces. From the sources it seems clear that the qualities of Pheidias's works which struck the ancient viewer most forcefully were their exceptional beauty and grandeur. The Greek terms used to describe these qualities are |iéye0oç and KctXXoç. The closest Latin equivalents seem to be maiestas and pondus , and pulchritudo. These terms were used in a technical sense in connection with the so-called 'phantasia' theory of Greek art, according to which art gradually developed from simple imitation of nature to the expression of the artist's spiritual intuition and imagination.1612 According to this theory, the works of Pheidias represented the culminating point in the development of the art of sculpture. Pheidias, it was thought, had a perfect imagination and an intuitive awareness of the nature of the gods. He also had the unique ability to translate his ideas into sculptural form and thus make visible to others some of his insight into the nature of the gods. Quintilian goes so far as to say that Pheidias's statues were so inspired that they helped to express and even to develop popular religious beliefs in a way that no other sculptures were ever able to do.1613 The works which earned Pheidias the greatest admiration were his colossal chryselephantine masterpieces, in particular the Athena Parthenos of Athens and the Zeus at Olympia. Their most obvious and impressive characteristics were their great size and their fabulous materials, which are often commented upon in the sources. These must have 1610 Arrian, 1.6.23; Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII. 5 1-52. 1611 Arrian, 11.19.23, for instance, comments on how recognizable Pheidias' works were. 1612 Pollitt (1974) 52ff. 1613 Quintilian, Inst. Or. XII.10.9. 635</page><page sequence="651">636 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS contributed to the awesome majesty of the works and to the view that they truly revealed something of the divine being. It does not take much imagination to have some idea of how impressive the works must have appeared, especially in their original settings. Robed in gold, these enormous figures dominated the interiors of their temples. The Athena Parthenos was unique in that she was covered in an important quantity of gold from the Athenian state reserve, quite a claim to fame in itself. The Zeus at Olympia must have been particularly impressive because of his size: he sat enthroned in the temple naos and he was so large a figure, occupying about one-third of the space of the central nave, that he was completely out of scale with the building. He looked as if he would go through the roof if he ever tried to stand up, as Strabo graphically records.1614 Later writers criticize the obvious difference in scale between the temple and its image.1615 But the size of the Zeus was no accident. For the temple at Olympia had been built for some time before Pheidias was asked to design the new temple image, and the workshop in which Pheidias made the statue had exactly the same internal dimensions as the temple naos. It is possible that there was an element of one-upmanship in the commission, the Eleians wanting a bigger and better statue than the Athenians had, and perhaps the enormous size was thought to maximize the impact of the statue. Very different was the case of the Parthenos, where statue and setting were planned simultaneously, and great care was taken to harmonize the two. This is apparent from the unusual internal arrangements of the Parthenon, discussed in Athena Parthenos, section 7, which provided, amongst other things, the widest possible space for the statue, as well as enough room to view the statue from all angles and a pleasing backdrop for it. The interaction between statue and setting was clearly an important concern of Pheidias. Another statue which illustrates this is the colossal outdoor Athena 'Promachos', which stood on the Akropolis and quickly became an Athenian landmark. The exact height of the Promachos is not known for certain, but she was clearly very large indeed for the tip of her lance and her helmet crest could be seen by sailors out at sea as they approached Athens. She stood behind the old Propylaia, awaiting visitors as they entered the sacred enclosure of the citadel, with her two temples behind her on either side. When Mnesikles rebuilt the Propylaia in the 430s BC, he altered the angle of the building so that visitors could see Pheidias 's statue even as they came through the Propylaia. There is a strong awareness of setting in another work associated with Pheidias: the Parthenon frieze. This was designed in such a way that the movement of the figures depicted on it, which goes from west to east, mirrors the direction in which real people would have approached the temple. Since none of the works attributed to Pheidias in the sources survive in the original, it is difficult to gain access to the style of Pheidias. But a work which is securely attributed to Pheidias and which is better known than any of the other attributed works is the multi- figured Amazonomachy on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. A careful comparison of the shield composition and the Parthenon sculptures is attempted in the chapter on the Parthenon, with special attention to head and figure types, figure poses, drapery and landscape elements. It is argued that the shield figures have close affinities with the Parthenon sculptures, in particular with the metopes and frieze. Since this is the case, there seems to be good reason to believe that the design and style of the Parthenon sculptures should be associated with Pheidias who, at the same time as he was making the 1614 Strabo, 8.3.30. 1615 See, for example, Martial, Ep. 7.56, and Statius, Silv . 1.1.101-02.</page><page sequence="652">LIFE OF PHEIDIAS 637 Athena Parthenos, was probably the director and artistic designer of the sculptural progamme of the Parthenon. One of the standards of ancient art was verisimilitude, and it cannot be doubted that an important aspect of Pheidias's brilliance was his mastery of the realistic portrayal of the human figure.1616 His Athena Lemnia was reputed to be of outstanding beauty, and his Amazon too attracted warm praise.1617 A study of the head and figure types and the figure poses of the Parthenos shield, as they are known to us in the available copies, reveals that Pheidias had an easy command of human anatomy and he was able to render in relief varied action poses which were strongly inspired by the painter's repertoire. The expression of feelings was achieved more through body pose than facial set. This gives the figures an idealizing air and a timelessness which seems to put them at one remove from every day human experience. The shield figures are discussed both in the section concerning the shield of the Athena Parthenos, and in the discussions of the Parthenon sculptures. In addition, Pheidias perfected a system of drapery carving which not only enhanced the decorative appeal of his work and looked realistic in itself, but which also helped to add to the realism of the human form beneath. In particular, Pheidias was adept at creating the effect of illusionary transparency. This technique appears on all three sculptural groups of the Parthenon and is most successfully rendered on the latest of these, the pediments, sculptures which Pheidias could have designed even if he did not work on them personally. Obvious examples are the famous female figures, K, L and M on the east side. The technique became very popular in later sculpture of the 5th century BC at Athens, under the influence of Pheidias's works. From the Parthenon sculptures one may observe that the execution of this idea varies according to the skill of individual artists, presumably working from a detailed design. Used as a means of expressing motion, drapery helped to breathe life into Pheidias's sculptures. Although the idea of motion lines, like that of transparent drapery, had its roots in sculpture of much earlier times, it was not until Pheidias's generation that disturbed and flying drapery was successfully shown as a decorative device without interfering with the realistic portrayal of the human form. As in the case of transparent drapery, motion lines are rendered with varying skill by the numerous sculptors of the Parthenon. The use of both of these devices on the Parthenos shield, albeit in a limited way, confirms Pheidias's familiarity with them. This is discussed in the chapter on the Parthenon, section 2. The varied figure poses used on the shield of the Parthenos, with people shown moving up and down, forwards and backwards, points to another feature of Pheidias's work which is very important for the later development of sculpture: his use of landscape elements. The inclusion of such elements allowed the artist much greater freedom in the range of poses he could show and in the sort of group compositions he could attempt. In this respect, Pheidias seems to have been influenced primarily by painting. Although his use of 1616 Notice Martial's comment ( Epigr . 3.35) about the fish engraved in a bowl attributed to Pheidias: add water and they look as if they are swimming. One may doubt that the bowl Martial was describing was really by Pheidias, but Pheidias's reputation for the life-like portrayal of living things may well have been based partly on his engravings. These are little known, but Pausanias, V.10.1, does state that the cloak of the Zeus at Olympia was covered in little animals and flowers. 1617 The Athena Lemnia is possibly referred to in Pliny, NH 34.54; for the Amazon see Lucian's comments in Imag . 4-6.</page><page sequence="653">638 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS landscape elements remained limited, it nevertheless started a trend which had important repercussions in later sculpture, pointing the way not only to setting figures within a recognizable scene but also to introducing landscape elements for their own sake. As far as composition is concerned, Pheidias seems to have tried many different approaches. The statue bases of the Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia probably showed large and rather static groups of gods set soberly in a row. One might compare with these the east frieze of the Parthenon. In contrast with this, diagonally placed groups of fighters in violent conflict dominate the circular surface of the Parthenos shield. The shield figures demonstrate the artist's interest in showing the human figure in a number of similar and yet subtly differing positions, the effect of which is partly to suggest movement. This device is found also on the frieze and pediments of the Parthenon. The format of the frieze dictates lateral movement. Although some apobatai (armed warriors on the chariots) are shown climbing up or down, most of the moving figures are shown on one level and movement is expressed in the constant ebb and flow of the composition, as groups of figures in motion alternate with stationary figures, while several figures are shown moving in one direction but looking in the other. In the pediments, the natural shape of the space is again used to maximum advantage. The simple and traditional device of progressing from the angles with reclining figures through to seated figures and finally to standing figures is adopted, more or less, though the effect of the cut-off figures of Helios and Selene in the east pediment is to suggest that the scene continues outside the limits of the architectural frame. This idea may have originated in painting rather than sculpture, though it had already been seen on the Cerberus metope from the east side of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. In the Parthenon pediments the various figures in the two compositions aie cleverly knitted together by the device of using their pose to reflect their reaction to the central event of each pediment. It is as if a central explosion occurs, the impact of which is felt most strongly by those who are nearby and ever less so the further the figures are from this event. The central composition of the west side is well known from the remaining fragments. Athena and Poseidon, who stand in opposing diagonals as they struggle against each other for the land of Attica, form a dynamic and violent cross with their leg patterns. This motif dominates the pediment and unifies it as all the other figures watch and react to the central drama. It recurs in the Amazonomachy from Nikopolis, which may be a copy of the Pheidian composition that adorned the footstool of the Zeus at Olympia. Pheidias was so famous that he became a legend. His friendship with Perikles and other influential figures, the importance of the commissions he won and his handling of vast quantities of Athenian gold were enough to create endless rumours and speculation about him, and it seems probable that his success eventually led to his downfall. His works too became legendary, not only because of their workmanship and artistic qualities, but because of the popular ideas that became attached to them. Ancient tourists, like their modern counterparts, were delighted to have something unusual or even extraordinary to admire. On the shield of the Athena Parthenos tourists looked out for the supposed portraits of Pheidias and Perikles, and they were told of an amazing mechanism which held the shield together in such a way that the whole work would collapse if ever one part was tampered with. When viewing the Zeus at Olympia tourists looked out for the place where they were told lightning had once stuck, as well as for the graffito on one of the god's fingers, which stated that Pheidias loved Pantarkes. That all these stories are true seems highly doubtful. They confirm Pheidias's great reputation and add a certain mystery to his name, but they add little to our knowledge of the artistic qualities of his works.</page><page sequence="654">5. DOUBTFUL ATTRIBUTIONS Several works are mentioned in the sources about which very little is known. Their attribution to Pheidias is, therefore, difficult to confirm. Pausanias often provides the only available source for a given statue and one may feel, rather cynically, that local guides were only too happy to point out 'their Pheidias' to him. The Apollo Parnopios on the Athenian Akropolis, the Hermes Pronaos at Thebes, and the Athena at Pellene were probably unsigned works for Pausanias makes it clear that he is merely repeating what people told him concerning the authorship of these statues.1618 The fact that he does not describe the works, beyond recording that they were made of bronze, stone, and ivory and gold, respectively, makes it very hard to know what they might have looked like and whether or not Pausanias was informed correctly about who made them. In the case of the Aphrodite Ourania in the Athenian Agora, for which Pausanias is again the only source, Pausanias does not hesitate in stating Pheidian authorship.1619 This suggests that he felt confident in his assertion. Perhaps the work was signed.1620 Like Pausanias, Pliny too is sometimes the sole source for several works which he claims were by Pheidias. Pliny mentions a marble Aphrodite that was taken to Rome, but he gives no description except to say that it was of outstanding beauty.1621 Whether Pliny's reference can be linked with any other sources, which perhaps help to identify the statue type, is not certain.1622 In his book on bronze statuary, Pliny lists several statues which he says were by Pheidias about which almost nothing is known.1623 He mentions an Athena taken to Rome: could this be, as Linfert suggests, the Athena Tritaia which Pausanias was told had been replaced by a 'modern' stone statue after the old bronze original had been removed to Rome?1624 Pliny also lists a cliduchus statue. It is not known whether Pliny is referring to a statue of a key-bearing priestess, a subject also treated by Euphranor, or whether he is in fact using the title of Athena, for Pliny includes the statue in the midst of a list of Pheidian Athenas.1625 If so, which Athena is he talking about? Since Pliny omits to mention the great bronze Athena of Pheidias in this list of Pheidian bronzes, it is sometimes argued that the 'cliduchus' could refer to that statue, but, as discussed in the chapter on the Athena Promachos, there are problems with such an identification. Pliny 1618 Pausanias, 1.24.8, Xeyoixji; Pausanias, IX. 10.2, XéyeTai; Pausanias, VII.27.2, cķaal. 1619 Pausanias, 1.14.7. 1620 Harrison (1984) 379ff. claims the Aphrodite for Agorakritos, but Delivorrias (1994a) 651-2 supports Pausanias' s claim. 1621 Pliny, NH 36.15. 1622 See Strocka (2004) concerning the Aphrodite later in Rome, 219f., and Pliny, M/36.17. 1623 Pliny, NH 34.54. 1624 Linfert (1982) 58-59; Pausanias, VII.22.6. 1625 For Euphranor' s statue, see Pliny NH 34.78. 639</page><page sequence="655">640 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS also lists three male statues, one a colossal nude and the other two figures in cloaks. Beyond the fact that they were made of bronze and that the last two were in Rome, nothing whatsoever is known about these works. In cases where both Pausanias and Pliny refer to a work but disagree about authorship, it is not always easy to know who is right. Pausanias, 1.33.2-8, attributes the Nemesis at Rhamnous to Pheidias, while Pliny, NH 36.17, attributes it to his pupil Agorakritos. This work, of which the iconography has been established, is now generally accepted to be by Agorakritos. There were many stories about Pheidias 's special affection for the young Parian sculptor, some to the effect that Pheidias deliberately let Agorakritos sign his works because he liked him. This has led scholars to attribute other works to Agorakritos which Pausanias says were by Pheidias. Cases in point are the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens, mentioned above, and the Mother of the gods in the Athenian Metroon. This last statue is attributed to Pheidias by two writers, Pausanias, 1.3.5, and Arrian, Peripl 9, 1, but Pliny, NH 36.17, mentions a statue in the sanctuary of the Mother of the gods by Agorakritos. Whether Pausanias and Pliny are talking about the same Meter statue or whether there was in fact more than one Meter statue and perhaps another Metroon in Athens remains unknown. Pliny says that Pheidias put the finishing touches on Alkamenes's Aphrodite in the Gardens.1626 Pausanias attributes to Pheidias the Athena at Elis which was probably the work of Kolotes.1627 In the sources a substantial number of works is wrongly attributed to Pheidias. The mistake is sometimes the result of a basic lack of knowledge on the part of the writer, often easily explained by the great gulf of time that separates the writer from Pheidias. So, for instance, Tzetzes, writing in the 12th century AD, wrongly attributes to Pheidias three statues in Constantinople: a Herakles, which was probably by Lysippos, the Anthelios Apollo, which probably came from Phrygia, and a Hera for which there is no evidence to link it to Pheidias.1628 Tzetzes is also the only source for an Athena supposedly made in competition with Alkamenes.1629 Another statue about which one might have grave doubts is a reclining marble Zeus in Constantinople which Kedrenos, also writing in the Byzantine period, attributes to Pheidias.1630 The 6th century AD writer Prokopios, admits that he is not sure whether the bronze bull in the Forum of Peace in Rome is by Pheidias or Lysippos.1631 Two other instances in the sources of apparent confusion between the works of Pheidias and those of Lysippos occur in Martial and Ausonius.1632 Martial raises the question of the authorship of a statue of Herakles and Ausonius talks of a statue of Occasio by Pheidias, which sounds very similar to the statue of Kairos by Lysippos. It is most doubtful that Pheidias ever made either an Occasio or a Herakles. Libanios in the 4th century AD talks of an Asklepios in Beroia, but the attribution to Pheidias may be more 1626 Pliny, NH 36.16. 1627 Pausanias, VI.26.3. 1628 Chil.

To an ill-informed reader, it may appear that Pausanias is talking about yet another work by Pheidias when he mentions the Asklepios at Epidauros. In fact, the temple at Epidauros and its statue of the god were not constructed until the first or second quarter of the 4th century BC. 1633 Libanios, Or. 30 section 22. 1634 Aleshire (1989) 7 states that the cult of Asklepios was introduced in Athens by a private citizen called Telemachos. 1635 Athenagoras, Leg. pro Christ. 17.4. 1636 Pausanias, V. 11.10.</page><page sequence="657">6.

THE MEDUSA RONDANINI TYPE The Medusa Rondanini, Munich Glyptothek no. 252, is a sculpture in high relief depicting the mask-like head of a woman. The whole of the face is rendered, but the head is cut away diagonally in a line from the top of the head to the chin so that, when the work is set flat against a surface, the forehead projects well beyond the line of the chin. This fact, coupled with the monumental size of this and nearly all the known copies, which are almost twice life-size, suggests that the work was intended to be seen from some distance below. The Medusa is shown as a beautiful woman with strongly marked, but in no way monstrous, features. Her identity is clear from the wings on either side of the top of the head, as well as from the two snakes which look out from beneath these wings, their bodies coming down on either side of the face and their tails entwining themselves around each other under her chin. These snakes are to a large extent worked quite separately from the head of Medusa, betraying the metallic nature of the original work. The face is rather triangular in shape, narrow at the chin and gradually widening towards a broad forehead. The facial features show large eyes, with thick lids and clearly indicated tear ducts, sharply ridged eyebrows, a long straight nose with strongly flaring nostrils, and a broad mouth with thick lips that are parted. The cheeks are full and the chin round. The hair, which is parted at the centre, forms neat waves above the forehead and then becomes a thick mass of riotous curls, plastically rendered. On some of the copies, including Torlonia 294, there is a distinctive knot of hair just above the central parting, where one lock curls up and there are other locks of hair coming out from beneath on either side. As Buschor points out, a close comparison of the known copies is very difficult because three of the copies - those once in Ostia and Würzburg and the one from which there is a plaster cast in Munich - are all thought to be lost, while the Krüger bronze, of which the authenticity is doubted by Eichler, is unpublished, and the Torlonia marbles are often inaccessible.1637 The name-piece in Munich is the best known of the copies, because it has been well published and it is often photographed. Its surface, however, has been heavily worked over, and Vierneisel-Schlörb considers Torlonia 294 and the piece at one time in Würzburg to be more faithful copies.1638 In addition to the seven works mentioned above 1637 Buschor (1958) 11; Eichler (1960) 172-74. 1638 Vierneisel-Schlörb (1979) 65. 649</page><page sequence="665">650 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS and listed by Buschor, as antique copies of the same original, there are six modern copies of this type, also listed by Buschor.1639 The treatment of the facial features, in particular the modelling of the nose, the low- arched eyebrows, the heavily lidded eyes and the full, slightly parted lips, has suggested comparison with such works as the Athena Velletri and the Munich Diomedes, leading to the conclusion that the type springs from the Classical period.1640 Belson, however, has argued that, intermingled with these stylistic traits, are certain iconographical features which indicate that the type cannot have been created until the Hellenistic period.1641 There are no known examples of the 'beautiful gorgoneion' type, which consists of the head alone, before the end of the 4th century BC, and it is also from this period that winged and beautiful gorgoneia start to become common. Earlier gorgoneia did sometimes have wings, but either they were of the grotesque type or their wings were attached to their bodies. Callaghan adds that the treatment of the hair finds its best parallels amongst Hellenistic ruler portraits of the 3rd century BC.1642 2. ATTRIBUTIONS The traditional view concerning the original of the Medusa Rondanini is that it was created within the Classical period. Furtwängler considered its original to come from within the circle of the Parthenon artists, and he believed it was some kind of decoration from the temple wall, perhaps by Kresilas.1643 Buschor attributed it to Pheidias and identified it as the head of the Gorgon from the shield of Athena Parthenos.1644 He was followed by Vierneisel-Schlörb, who compared it with the Athena Lemnia, as seen in the Bologna/Dresden type, and the Kassel Apollo, two works commonly associated with Pheidias.1645 These scholars date the original in the 440s BC. Others agree that the original is a Classical work but they do not think it is by Pheidias. Pfuhl and Lippold attributed the original to Kresilas.1646 Harrison has proposed a complex theory attributing the original to Alkamenes and identifying it as the decoration of a bronze shield which was placed on a 1639 Buschor (1958) 11.

One is the small head depicted on a cuirass on the Parthenon frieze, W. VI. 11. 1648 The other two come from the Athena Parthenos: the shield gorgoneion, mentioned above, and the aegis gorgoneion. The latter was almost certainly made of ivory. The material of the shield gorgoneion is not known for certain. Strocka has convincingly shown that the original figures of the shield Amazonomachy were probably modelled bronze appliqués.1649 But whether this was the case for the central gorgoneion too is unknown and perhaps doubtful, considering the available material evidence. For copies demonstrate that, whereas shield figures could be reproduced mechanically, the central gorgoneion - which differs widely from one copy to the next - was not reproduced in this way, perhaps for technical reasons. The basic type of the Parthenos Gorgons, which was common to them both, seems fairly clear: they had thick locks of hair parted down the middle of the head, heavy features, and the tongue was shown protruding from an open mouth. In other words, they were not of the so-called 'beautiful' gorgoneion type, like the Rondanini, but of the more old-fashioned 'grotesque' type, although they lacked the fangs and the exaggeratedly wide mouth of Archaic gorgons. This point is made by Robertson who nevertheless agrees with Buschor that the sculptor of the original of the Rondanini was probably Pheidias.1650 As noted in section 1, several aspects of this Medusa make it highly unlikely that the type was created as early as the 440s BC. Some scholars give the Rondanini type a much later date, ranging from Langlotz's view that it is an Attic Hellenistic work from the 2nd century BC, (and not, as he had previously thought, the shield gorgoneion of the Athena Parthenos), to the idea that it is a classicistic, eclectic Roman work, probably created in the Hadrianic period.1651 So Schuchhardt, followed by his pupil Strocka, then Zanker, and Floren.1652 This opinion is probably based to a large extent on the evidence of the Medusa Rondanini copy in Munich, which has been heavily worked over. Belson identifies the type with the image on a gilt bronze aegis which was dedicated on the Athenian Akropolis probably by Antiochos IV Epiphanes (175-164 BC), on whose coins it appears for the first time.1653 This theory has been revised by Callaghan, who points out that the beautiful Medusa was a Seleucid dynastic symbol even before the time of Antiochos IV. He is of the opinion that it had already figured on a monumental aegis erected in Athens by Antiochos III (223-187 BC). The image, he says, was incorporated in 1647 Harrison (1977) 162-64. 1648 Numbering follows Jenkins (1994). 1649 Strocka (1967) 129-30. 1650 Robertson (1975) 312-13. 1651 Langlotz (1947) 101, and revised opinion with lower dating Langlotz (1951) 34. 1652 Schuchhardt (1963) 33 n. 9; Strocka (1967) 128 and n. 218; Zanker (1974) 116; Floren (1977) 2 ff., 154 n. 180, 157 n. 182, 216f., n. 260. 1653 Belson (1980) 378.</page><page sequence="667">652 LIFE AND WORKS OF PHEIDIAS the ceramic repertoire of Crete in the last twenty years of the 3rd century BC, and it also appeared in Canosa in S. Italy in the first quarter of the 2nd century BC.1654 That the image should be diffused in these areas at these dates is not a matter of chance, for both places are known to have provided Antiochos with recruits for his various campaigns. Paoletti agrees with Callaghan's interpretation, as does Stewart, who has made a persuasive comparison with a copy of a 2nd century BC statue, the so-called Apollo Cyrene type, possibly the Apollo Kitharoidos of Timarchides.1655 Timarchides was a Neo- classical sculptor from Attica. A Neo-Classical origin for the work would explain attributions to Classical sculptors, in particular to Pheidias. 3. CATALOGUE 1. MEDUSA RONDANINI Munich, Glyptothek, 252. Medusa Rondanini. High relief sculpture. H. 0.388m Marble. Provenance unknown. Perhaps Hadrianic. This copy has been heavily worked over, so that the original surface is lost. The locks of hair on the top of the head are quite damaged, and the heads and the tails of the snakes are broken away. The piece first came to public attention through Goethe in 1786, when it was already in the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome. It was acquired for the Munich Glyptothek through J. M. Wagner in 1811. This high relief sculpture shows the head of a Medusa, depicted not as a monster but as a beautiful woman, with the addition of wings that sprout from either side of the top of her head. She is accompanied by two serpents whose bodies descend on either side of her face, with the tails entwined under her chin. Their heads, now missing, emerged from under the wings. Medusa's smooth, full face is wide at the forehead, but it gradually tapers towards a narrow chin. The eyes are heavily lidded and the tear ducts clearly indicated. The eyebrows are only slightly arched. The long narrow nose flares noticeably at the nostrils. The large, thick lips are slightly parted. The hair, parted at the centre, forms a mass of untidy curls.

Seminar. Plaster cast of Rondanini type. Close in size to Medusa Rondanini. Made from a sculpture of early Imperial date, which is now lost. The plaster cast shows a well preserved piece, though some parts that have broken away include the right wing, part of the left wing, and the heads and tails of the serpents. The tightly curled locks on the top of the head are better preserved than on the Medusa Rondanini (see Buschor (1958) pl. 5, 2 and compare with the same view of the Medusa Rondanini, pl. 5, 1). Nothing is known of the whereabouts of the work from which the plaster cast was made. This plaster cast of a lost copy of the Medusa Rondanini type is quite close to the Medusa Rondanini, though details such as the eyelids and lips have a harder, more metallic character. The nose appears wider at the bridge, so that the nostrils do not flare in so marked a fashion as on the Medusa Rondanini. BIBLIOGRAPHY Belson, J. D. (1980) 373-78. Buschor, E. (1958) 12.

The surface of this piece has not been worked over and it is slightly pitted. The snakes' heads and tails are still present. This relief is a careful copy of the Medusa Rondanini type. According to Vierneisel-Schlörb, this is one of the best copies of the type, superior to the Medusa Rondanini replica of which the surface has been entirely worked over. The triangular shaped face, the long, straight nose with flaring nostrils, the fleshy lips that are parted and the heavily lidded eyes can all be observed in this copy too. Above the central hair parting a lock of hair curls upwards, giving the impression of a knot of hair with curls emerging either side. This part is damaged on the Medusa Rondanini, but a similar arrangement can be observed on several of the copies, including the Ostia and Krüger copies, though not on Torlonia 296 or the Munich plaster cast.
