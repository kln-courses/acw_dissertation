<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classical Quarterly 52.1 33-49 (2002) Printed in Great Britain 33 SING, MUSE ... : THE INTROIT FROM HOMER TO APOLLONIUS' I This paper attempts to reconstruct the development, from Homer to Hellenistic times, of the prayer for inspiration found at the beginning of Greek epic poems; we may, on a liturgical analogy, call this the 'introit' (I intend to reserve the word 'proem', which is usually applied to these texts, for the hymns that prefaced poetic performances). I have divided the present study into two parts. The conclusion of this first section is that the introits of written epics composed prior to the classical period largely conserved the prayer's traditional format and its complex amalgam of functions, both of which went back to the era of pre-literate extempore bardic performance, perhaps deep into pre-Hellenic history. The second part will consider the effects of the philosophical and literary innovations of the classical and Hellenistic periods, as well as examining the distinct species of proems. Bardic ideology Introits appear to have originated as the pre-performance prayers of bards, and we may begin by examining the ideology of bardship constructed in our earliest texts. Later ancient writers and modem scholars often downplay the importance attributed to inspiration in bardic recitation, claiming that bards were regarded as being at least partners of the Muses.2 Havelock, for instance, described the Muse as merely 'the symbol of the bard's command of professional secrets';3 and Moiraa may be derived from an Indo-European root denoting mental activity.4 Homer, however, consistently asserts the supernatural character of bardic recitation. Bards owe their bardship to the gods (Od. 8.44-5, 8.496-8, 17.518-20, 22.347-8), and specifically to the Muses (Od. 8.62-6, 8.479-81, 8.488). 'L'idre de l'aede comme auteur du chant est en effet "systematiquement" rejetee par Hombre', notes Svenbro, discussing Homer's reluctance to describe bards in terms associated with craftsmen.5 References to bardic inspiration introduce recitations in the Odyssey; the phrase dot68 dlaeE, presenting the bard himself as 'auteur', appears only when they are concluding.6 I am indebted to Professor James Diggle, Dr Martin West, and (most of all) Dr Johannes Haubold for the assistance with which they have furnished me in the composition of this paper, which is gratefully dedicated to Tony Whittaker. 2 Ancient writers: e.g. Euphorio fr. 118 Powell.

WHEELER At II. 2.591-600, in a story of possibly great antiquity, bardship is constructed as binary, either granted or denied by the gods (though mortals clearly decide when to exercise it); and bards carried sceptres, elsewhere closely associated with sacred figures and sacred speech.' Admittedly, bardship did not involve possession or Pavia: passages such as Plat. Phaedr. 245a are unhelpful here. Muse-possession is unknown to Homer-the notion appears first in Democritus (Bl7f D-K )-and to this extent the scepticism of some critics as to how well-developed the Homeric theology of inspiration was is not unreasonable.8 Nonetheless, bards are consistently presented as enjoying a unique access to the divine: [The] language of the gods excels human language both in its power to express events in the world and in its sheer material force. And the voice that poets borrow from them shares in both these sublimities.9 This brings us to the point that bards possessed unique objectivity. In Homer and Hesiod, the formula 'OA'tprrma 8c4uar' E'Xovaal often denotes the Muses, and 'OAvrrta 84/Lar E"XOV'cES the gods in general. The Muses are thus located outside normal human space and their observations lent a superhuman perspective. They seem also to be located outside time: speaking through bards, they present hic et nunc data concerning past, present, and future'o (Homer's use of vivv in internal invocations-on which vide infra-may be intended to point this contrast). Furthermore, the boundary separating form from content was blurred," and inspiration was not restricted to one or the other: both came from 'OAtvrrox. Hesiod seems to profess the same ideology, and it is in the Theogony that we first find the familiar motif of the poet's divine investiture. The locus in question is the notoriously controversial passage at Theog 22-34 in which the Muses claim the ability to utter at will both EV6ea ... ErtpoLrLV 4pota and dA/0E'a.12 Many have seen Hesiod as suggesting that some bardic song (Homer's?) is potentially deceitful; post- structuralist critics have even seen the passage as problematizing the relationship between &amp;A~~lOa and reality.'3 Yet Hesiod's simple point should not be overlooked: ordination by the Muses guarantees access to divine truth (which is, furthermore, specifically contrasted with human falsehoodsl4). For him, words presented unmedi- ated reality. The Muses nowhere actually admit to lying, and '[the] use of polar 7 E.g. P. E. Easterling, 'Agamemnon's skeptron in the Iliad', in M. M.

Originally, d&amp;Area probably denoted scrupulously reported, not simply veracious material, and Hesiod appears to be innovating in linking the term to divine discourse and to prophecy.16 Nonetheless, throughout Greek literature, the word always refers to true utterances. As Pratt argues, Homer appears not to realize that a witness's honesty does not guarantee his or her reliability17 (nor, we may add, does Hesiod): the Muses, however, are able to recount perfect knowledge perfectly scrupulously. Furthermore, as Adkins showed,is attempts to link JA-cE ta too closely with purely social Ptv-qtkoahv'7 and oppose it simply to A0q encounter serious objections.19 Mv'ptooatv'vq was a divine, objective reality, the Muses' mother, and the outstanding characteristic of bardic recitations was their objective truthfulness, as Homer's own characters recognize (e.g. II. 6.354-8; Od. 8.579-80, 24.194-202). The 'uniform and dispassionate mode of presentation which the Muse's narrative calls for'20 discernible in Homer (outside the speeches, which are more obviously subjective) is doubtless a reflex of this ideology. Finally, we should consider Odysseus' narratives in the Odyssey. These have generated considerable scholarly interest: Doherty, for example, sees in the epic a strategy of repetitions which 'links the credibility of the hero to that of the bards portrayed in the poem' and to Homer himself.21 But Odysseus is an anti-bard. His voice is certainly sometimes associated with Homer's;22 he employs certain bardic motifs, including those associated with the commencement of recitations, and is compared to a bard.23 He speaks, though, on his own authority (note vtairrw at 9.37-8)-and, obviously, lies. He is subtly measured against and contrasted with genuine, inspired dotSol. The form and functions of introits It was thus not unnatural for bards, beginning their recitations, to invoke their inspiration-source: we may attempt to reconstruct the form of their invocations, both a priori and on the evidence of our earliest written introits (which may perhaps not, as we shall see, include those of the vulgate Homer and Hesiod). They probably made their prayers out loud, this being usual among the Greeks;24 to the Muse(s),25 whose 15 G. Ferrari, 'Hesiod's mimetic muses and the strategy of deconstruction', in A.

The practice of invoking one particular specified Muse (e.g. Sappho fr. 124 PLF; perhaps also fr. 260 SLG), post-dates Hesiod, arguably the first poet to differentiate between the individual Muses (M. L.West, Hesiod: Theogony [Oxford, 1966], on 76).</page><page sequence="4">36 G. WHEELER genealogy and dwelling-place they may have mentioned;26 in the imperative, the original verb-form of prayer,27 perhaps using the verbs dEtSE(-rE) or Ev(v)ErrE(rE),28 which may have been strengthened by ayE or viv29 and accompanied by a pronoun such as ~ot;30 and in verse, like all our extant introits, inspiration not being necessary in poetic composition and recitation.31 They must have specified to the Muse the subject of which they would tell, perhaps beginning with a single noun followed by modifiers,32 and probably ended by specifying the point at which the succeding recitation was to begin.33 West notes certain formal similarities between introits and Near-Eastern poetic openings, which frequently included elements such as an initial noun-phrase followed by modifiers, a reference to the narrator's act of narration and an anticipation of the poem's contents.34 Near-Eastern influence on Greek introits is quite possible: the shared format is not universal, not appearing even in later European texts emerging from oral traditions such as the Nibelungenlied, the Chanson de Roland (if it comes from an oral tradition) and Beowulf. Nor is the emphasis on the narrator's act of narration universal: the openings of Yugoslavian songs, for instance, may refer to the singers in the plural, as if 'the song has here become all of the audiences who, together with an entire tradition of [bards], have participated in making and remaking the song'.35 Why, though, were texts ever given introits? The arresting fact is that the complex cluster of functions of bardic introits may be argued also to have underlain those found in later epic texts, with no fundamental change evident until Hellenistic times. On one view, the post-Homeric evolution of society and of the social status of language destroyed the old ideology of inspired speech and song: Detienne wrote of the 'decline of the magicoreligious speech that accompanied the old system of thought'.36 Rulers had previously been accounted inspired like bards (Theog. 75-93); the value of words was now, however, determined by their speaker's justification of their employment, not by the status of their pretended source. The introit may have been an originally pious and sincere prayer that later became fossilized. 26 Sappho frs. 53, 103.8 PLF; Alcman frs. 3 (fr. 1.1ff.), 5 (fr. 2.1.28ff.), 8.9ff., 27 PMG; 'OA1 rtma 8 S'ar' 4Xoveaa occurs in nearly all of Homer's internal invocations (vide infra). 27 Pulleyn questions the extent to which imperative-prayers and optative-prayers were dis- tinguished, at least in classical times ([n. 24], 150-1). 28 E.g. II. 1.1; Od. 1.1, 9.37; Ear-re or EvE7TE in Homer's internal invocations (infra); Archilochus fr. 117 IEG2. E. Risch argued that Ev(v)r*Tw had retained its Indo-European root's sense of 'kunstvolles und feierliches Berichten' ('Homerisch IvvE'rw, lakonisch 10ev Trov r und die alte Erziihlprosa', ZPE 60 [1985], 9). On the two words and their likely periods of use, vide G. Nagy, Pindar's Homer (Baltimore, 1990), 20-1. 29 Sappho fr. 118 PLF; Alcman frs. 14a, 27 PMG; Stesichorus frs. 63, 101 PMG; vide supra on vv'. 30 Although B. Marzullo (II problemo omerico [Florence, 1952], 482, n. 2) claimed that invocations cannot originally have contained any first-person forms; vide also e.g. K. J. Atchity, Homer's Iliad (Carbondale, 1978), 246-7. 3' At II. 9.189, for instance, Achilles' song is not said to be inspired. 32 One thinks, naturally, of the canonical Homeric introits.

The archaic texts themselves do not encourage such doubts,37 but this in itself proves little. Firstly, we may doubt whether the Homeric anthropomorphic system ever commanded credence: Homer's characters typically employ non-specific terms such as oeds ?rs and Salowv in their references to the divine, conceivably suggesting-in so far as generalizations are possible here--an unspecific belief in an overarching supernatural power or body of powers whose supposed actions were conventionally ascribed to the individual categories of 'Apollo', Aphrodite', and so forth.38 Inspiration could slide from one category to another and be attributed to deities other than the Muses.39 Furthermore, evidence of conflicting traditions such as H.Dion. 1-6 and Demo- docus' un-Iliadic first lay makes one wonder whether bardic ideology was ever truly credible; Theog. 367-370 attests the existence of (probably variant) local traditions, and conflicts must have been apparent even between individual bards' material. Finally, it would have been obvious that bards had to learn, probably by means of long apprenticeships, the technical skills and poetic subject-matter essential to their craft,4" a fact which Homer suppresses: the description of Phemius as dvtro8)7 aKro~ at Od. 22.347-8, which seems at first sight to tell against this point, probably refers to inborn talent (it is significant, for example, that E't'Sa6E is applied twice to the Muses' action on Demodocus at 8.479-81 and 487-8).41 We may ask, then, precisely what purpose introits had. Clearly, they recalled an ideology of divinely inspired recitation: speculation regarding individuals' precise motives here is unwise,42 but we may conjecture some general explanations. Firstly, the force of convention may have underlain even bards' use of introits: the burden of the past would certainly have weighed upon later poets, who may also have written introits purely as a literary conceit. Secondly, introits set the tone for the main composition immediately catching an audience's attention (one recalls here Arist. Rhet. 1414b on rhetorical rpoolpta). Thirdly, poets may have used them to lend weight to praise of patrons or to the 37 Pace e.g. P. Pucci's brilliant analysis (The Song of the Sirens [Lanham, 1998], 31-48), which depends heavily upon a passage which is probably a late interpolation. De Jong finds only a handful of passages appearing to challenge bardic ideology (Narrators and Focalizers [Amster- dam, 1987], 47-9), most of them otherwise explicable. 38 Vide, famously, 0. J6rgensen, 'Das Auftreten der Gotter in den Biichern L-Lp der Odyssee', Hermes 39 (1904), 357-82; also E E. Brenk, 'Demonology in the early imperial period', ANRW 16.3 (1986), 2071-82 (with doxography); cf. Od 22.347-8. In fact, the phrase OEO's Lt merely indicates the speaker's ignorance of the identity of the god whose action he or she is experiencing and does not necessarily imply belief in an 'overarching supernatural power'; the employment of the phrase does, however, highlight how potentially difficult it was (and, arguably, how uncommon) for one to categorize specifically irruptions of the divine into human existence. 39 E.g. Od 8.487-8; Theog 94-6; HH.Homm. 1.17-19, 6.19-20, 10.4-5, 24.4-5, 25. 4 The uncoupling of poetry and prophecy, both originally associated with intoxication, seems to have effected the breaking of the link between poetic inspiration and intoxication at which later literature hints (Scheinberg [n. 13]; M. Durante, Sulla preistoria della tradizione poetica greca pt. 2, Incunabula Graeca 64 [Rome, 1976], 169; R. Lamberton, Hesiod [New Haven, 1988], 60, who notes that the ancients assumed that Hesiod claimed to have eaten the Muses' laurel). It was perhaps then that bards became primarily skilled craftsmen. 41 Vide further W. G. Thalmann, Conventions of Form and Thought in Early Greek Poetry (Baltimore, 1984), 126-7. 42 Though it seems reasonable to conclude that the use of introits was probably not consciously ironic, at least before Hellenistic times (for a different opinion, vide R. J. Rabel Plot and Point of View in the Iliad [Ann Arbor, 1997], 30).</page><page sequence="6">38 G. WHEELER propagation of their own or others' ideologies. Scodel has uncovered latent indications in Homer that the distinction between bardic and non-bardic discourse erected by the poet is illusory and points out that the latter can never be entirely objective, since it always occupies a certain set of circumstances.43 Art does not exist in a social vacuum: Finnegan cautions that oral poetry is frequently controlled by narrow 61lites,44 a notion famously discussed by Svenbro.45 An ideology of divine inspiration would have ratified the Weltanschauung-their patrons' or their own-which bards and poets propounded (and would have excused any witting or unwitting lapses). We may note too the ironies in the construction of apparently authoritative Muses as virgins under Zeus' control who speak through male bards.46 Fourthly, claiming divine inspiration, whether or not such claims were taken literally, had extra point in competitive poetic environments. Bards were probably competitive both formally and informally from early times,47 and the motives for encoding a claim of equality with or superiority to one's fellows in references to a supposed special relationship with the Muses were probably always potent. Finally, the practice may have reflected poets' genuine experience in composition. Creators of Kunstwerke from numerous times and cultures from Jeremiah to Robert Graves have sensed some sort of inspiration. And, even though belief in specifically theistic inspiration probably became steadily less attractive, we may conjecture that many poets still sensed the OELov quality of their poetic abilities48 and wished to acknowledge or defer to it. Homer's introits Our oldest surviving epic introits are those with which the Homeric texts begin. Failure to read the Homeric epics in the light of the probable circumstances of their composition and assembly may fairly be regarded as a weakness of contemporary Homeric scholarship: we must determine exactly when our transmitted introits came into being before attempting an analysis. Our response to this question will depend upon our views concerning the poems' composition. If we adopt an 'evolutionist' stance, we must conclude that the introits date from the later archaic period, when redactors added them by analogy with those of the authentic improvisional recitations which they could still attend or remember. We may conclude with some confidence that this happened to Hesiod's Erga: though the Alexandrians' wholesale suspicions regarding Hesiod's openings seem excessive, the Erga's proem-like introit was, significantly, not regarded as canonical in antiquity.49 On this view, no Homeric text existed until perhaps the sixth century. Each constituent lay 43 R. Scodel, 'Bardic performance and oral tradition in Homer', AJPh 119 (1998), 180-92. 44 R.

It is, however, possible to argue that introits could not have been written while oral poetry still flourished: introits were metatextual, resembling (for example) African singers' addresses to and references to their accompanists." They ostensibly requested the Muses' assistance in composition and performance, originally a single act. Written introits would therefore have seemed quite out of place to poets familiar with bardic ideology; if anything, 'writing poets' (if they read their texts in performance, which is admittedly another unprovable conjecture) might have been expected to refer in performance to the fact that they were reading texts, like the French jongleurs.52 It could further be argued that it was this divorce of composition from performance and the resulting softening of incongruities that led to the appearance of the introit in genres such as choral lyric and to the use appearance of first-person verbs referring to the poet or to the poet and his Muse, seen first in Hesiod (Erga 10, 106-7, 202; II. 2.484-93 is probably not authentically Homeric-vide infra) and subsequently in numerous later poets, most notably in introductions and introits.53 Consistent with our conjecture is the absence from the record of any acquaintance with the canonical introits before classical times, though Pigres (fl. early fifth century?) was able to tamper with the canonical Iliadic introit-if the Suda's testimony is to be relied upon, which is admittedly uncertain-and Aeschylus certainly knew of it.54 It must be emphasized, however, that the down-dating of the canonical Homeric introits (and, by implication, of the Theogony introit) tentatively proposed here is essentially speculative. Divine assistance was sometimes requested within a poem, and several internal Muse-invocations survive in the Iliad (2.484-93, 2.761-2, 11.218-20, 14.508-10, 16.112-13). These have little in common with introits (though introits may have used the formula ad7TETEm K.T.A. seen in all of them except 2.761-7). They are essentially rhetorical questions like 5.703-4 and 8.273, and most attempts to account for their apparently eccentric distribution remain uncompelling:55 in general, they throw apparently inappropriate emphasis on the passages they precede (pace the scholia ad locc.). Perhaps significantly, they tend to precede lists-appropriate loci for Muse- invocations, since 'where to begin in such cases is not as self-evident as it is in other situations'.56 They cannot in general be introits to hypothetical component lays of the Iliad, a superficially attractive hypothesis: there are too few, they neither precede natural opening passages nor succede obvious closing ones, and they are formally 50 Hence the use of the Odyssey's introit to question the unity of Homer (vide most recently R. D. Dawe, The Odyssey [Lewes, 1993], on 1.1-10) seems open to criticism. 51 I.Okpewho, The Epic in Africa [New York, 1979], 60-1. 52 P.

As noted, introits probably specified the subject of the following lay: the request at 16.112-13 is fulfilled in the following ten lines; those at 11.218-20 and 14.508-10 are each fulfilled in the following line. The Catalogue of Ships, however, has often been adjudged an interpolation, and its introduction at 2.484-93 may be a genuine introit (its relatively late date explaining its incongruous first-person forms). The first written introits A survey of the earliest surviving introits will enable us to set in context the trans- mitted Homeric openings. The Erga's introduction is a proem rather than an introit, and is probably spurious anyway. Theog. 1021-2 is an interpolation, designed to link the Theogony with the Catalogue, a sixth-century creation;57 965-8 is probably an internal invocation, perhaps intended to recall those found in Homer, though it too is conceivably a late addition.58 The Theogony's introit itself (105-15) seems generally conservative, though its use of the verb KELE'TE (105), which seems not to have been a traditional introit verb, is rather surprising. No nouns referring specifically to the Muses are to be seen, though this is clearly to be explained by the fact that the introit immediately follows a hymn to the goddesses. Our next surviving Muse-invocations are those of Sappho,59 Alcman,60 Stesi- chorus61 and Archilochus.62 Their doubtless traditional references to the genealogy and home of the Muses have been mentioned; but, while all archaic poetry generally maintains the old ideology of inspiration, the introit's form was developing, and not always for inevitable generic reasons (which explain, for example, the presence of 4Ern 8' L/EpOV K.T.A. in Alcman fr. 27 PMG). The Muse is usually asked to 'come hither' rather than to speak or to sing (e.g. Sappho frs. 53, 127, 128 PMG); and, even admitting a general lack of 'plot' in lyric and elegy, Archilochus and Alcman seem vague when specifying their subject.63 Sappho invokes her lyre (fr. 118), Ibycus consciously distances himself from Homer64 and Stesichorus' Muse is his partner (fr. 33). Solon, too, experiments, beginning fr. 13 IEG2 with a prayer to the Muse: it is not an introit, however, since the favours that he requests do not include inspiration. The beginnings of pre-Socratic philosophy had no major consequences for the introit, though arguably theistic inspiration was becoming less credible: Epimenides' pseudo-Hesiodic initiation involved the abstracts Truth and Justice, not the Muses.65 Empedocles probably began the TIlEp Q' OEws with a proem and an address to his pupil,66 but an introit may not have followed immediately: El ydp at B131.1 cannot be inceptive (and cE'alvov-tr [4] confirms that Empedocles has begun without the Muse), while B3 did not precede the whole of the main text. Empedocles recalls the old ideology but does not wholly embrace it.67 Furthermore, while coo- words denote skill 7 M. West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (Oxford, 1985), 130-7. Whatever their date, the Theogony's internal invocations seem unremarkable, asking the Muses' assistance (with the Homeric viv at 965 and 1021) and summarising the content of the verse to come. 58 E.g.

Unfortunately, Hesiod fr. 1 Merkelbach-West, which dates from this period and appears to contain an introit at 14ff., scarcely admits of close analysis. The XapI-E~S had now joined the Muses as the goddesses associated with poetry and song, as numerous loci attest.69 Homer's XlpLtrES are the beautiful companions of Aphrodite and grant comeliness, not inspiration (e.g. II. 17.51-2; Od. 6.18, 18.192-4) (though they live near the Muses at Theog. 64-5). The two colleges may have been linked due to their similarly pleasurable spheres of operation.70 More specifically, Rito6k argued that the Muses inspired bards to sing lays that were true and pleasant:71 the dual truth-imparting and pleasure-giving function of the Mo-aat 7 sv~En7at (Theog. 965-8, 1021-2) made natural their association with the XEpL-ES. (Their association with the NldatL is less readily explicable,72 though the suggestion of Lydian influence found in the scholion ad Theoc. 7.92 may have some merit). In this experimental milieu, then, the canonical Homeric introits were composed. They exhibit parallel formal complexities: The theme comes first. . ., next the invocation . . ., then a four-syllable adjective characterizing the theme. . ., expanded by a relative clause. . ., further elaborated by two &amp;i-clauses.... In both the poet refers to the vast possibilities of the theme (pdAa IToAAd, iroAAcbv 8', rVoAAd 8'/lvp') and sorrows to be described.73 A similar complexity of content is evident.74 They are, nonetheless, conservative by contemporary standards, asking omniscient Muses with traditional imperatival formulae (including the verb Ev'E7rr in the Odyssey) to make known KaLG '/iLv (Od. 1.10) a specific story, which is introduced by a single noun followed by modifiers (though references to the Muses' genealogy and dwelling-place are absent, at least from the opening lines). This suggests a reluctance to introduce conceits or novelties into texts either created generations previously by a magisterial genius or consciously constructed from the material of an ancient and venerable tradition, perhaps for solemn public recitation. Parry showed how the introits contain supposedly oral phraseology found elsewhere in Homer;75 yet, even discounting coincidences, this means no more than that their authors knew their Homer. After all, the post- Alexandrian Batrachomyomachia employs much 'oral' language. The canonical introits have one particular eccentricity: the opening of the Odyssey focuses heavily on the events of Books 5-12 and fails even within these terms to 'Being and seeming: Empedocles' reply', Hermes 119 (1991), 288, n. 20. D. Obbink, 'The hymnic structure of the new Simonides', Arethusa 29 (1996), 199, fails to stress that bards could not even begin recitations without the Muse. 68 Related words are, indeed, used in relation to the Muses: e.g. Ibycus fr. la.20-31 PMG, Suda s.v.

This point is employed, for instance, by Pucci in his reduction of the Muse to a 'faint presence' in the Odyssey.76 Firstly, this under-interprets 4vspa, which declares that the whole poem 'will explore the terms in which an adult male's place in society is determined'.77 And, secondly, the selection of the Thrinacian episode 'signals that the plot's chief overall trajectory will highlight ethical or moral dilemmas within the broader context of heroic engagements'.78 There is no need to extend the introit or to hypothesize that the Muse invoked by Homer immediately corrects him.79 Still less may we contend that the Iliadic introit shares any supposed shortcomings of the Odyssey's:80 the opening phrase (MvtvL ... A tds ' Ed-EAELEo flovA-q 1.1-5, the ALS ... flovA', pace Aristarchus and Aristophanes, not relating specifically to Book 1) poses numerous questions regarding the human condition and the moral order which the epic goes on to explore.81 The XaprrEs (and N;pfIa) are absent from epic introits, probably due to a realization that the epic tradition assigned them no inspirational role. The first alternative Iliad introit preserved in the scholia is almost certainly the beginning of a proem, and the second seems unimpressive: /w7,S, for instance, which Homer uses only for the anger of gods and of Achilles, is used casually and clumsily-the author of the striking MwvL ... IH-qAtrL SE was more careful-and the gAE metaphor seems un-Homeric. The lines are clearly related to the canonical introit: but utrum in alterum? They show 'signs of inept condensation, and in particular the linking of Akhilleus' and Apollo's wrath does justice to neither'.82 They may conceivably have formed a kind of introit to the Iliad internal to the Epic Cycle: rTrETEr K.T.A. recalls Homer's internal invocations, v6v those of the Theogony.83 Let us now turn to the cyclic epics. As with Homer, it is irrelevant when their main text was constructed: since they seem never to have been performed en bloc and since they may well have been assembled in order to fill gaps left by Homer, it seems reasonable to suppose that they received their introits after the Homeric epics under the latters' influence. Wackernagel, noting the lateness of the language of the Iliupersis and Cypria fragments in particular, dated the latter's opening to 'nicht lange vor 500 v. Chr'.84 Turning to the text of the introits themselves, the Epigoni (fr. 1 PEG) identifies the theme with the traditional initial noun-plus-modifier(s), though the first-person &amp;pXtcEOa is employed, and v^v may mean simply 'now that the preceding cyclic poem has finished' (cf. r Aor-E'pwv). The Ilias Parva (Ill. Parvv. fr. 28 PEG85) also exhibits the noun-plus-modifier(s) opening and employs dELaLV, albeit in the first person; Evelyn-White suggested, fortasse recte, that Ill. Parvv. fr. 1, which is conventionally 76 P. Pucci, Odysseus Polutropos (Ithaca, 1997), 215. 77 Goldhill (n. 22), 2. 78 B. Louden, The Odyssey (Baltimore, 1999), 92. 79 P. V.

The cyclic introits' remains echo the conservatism of the Homeric openings, though their innovations-most notably, the Cypria's introduction launches straight into the narrative, though d ~to 8' E-rEAELEro fovA (fr. 1.7 PEG) echoes II. 1.5-may reflect the cycle's distinct genesis. The Homeric texts, however they were created, were probably intended to stand as monumental master- pieces of an ancient tradition; the cyclic epics were probably not. It thus seems that the pre-classical epic introit was remarkably hardy, resisting the substantial innovations which introits saw in other genres and very probably preserving both formal and functional features whose origins are lost in time. This conservatism, however, was not to last, and we shall in the second part of this paper see the revolutionary effect of radically changing perceptions of the Muse, of inspiration, and of literary composition in general. The Classical period Muse-invocations in non-epic verse continued to display formal innovations. Bacchylides mentions the Muse(s) often, and an apparently conservative introit begins his first epinician ode. The case of Pindar, however, is rather more complex. He refers to and invokes them numerous times, but not in every ode; his invocations, moreover, are often odd: he calls, for instance, on A4AdOELa (0. 10.3-6) and (most famously) on the [d]va4tdpfppyyesg ~pvot (0. 2.1-2). He is un-bardic elsewhere too: though he praises Homer, he helps his Muse and famously calls Homer a liar (I. 4.37-9; 0. 10.95-9; N. 7.20-3). It seems that Pindar claims inspiration but cannot adequately explain this inspiration according to the traditional ideology.87 In rather different vein, Simonides seems to undercut the Muse's role to differentiate his own martial narrative from Homer's and to point up the contrast between the circumstances in which he and Homer were composing. He hymns Achilles, including at frs. 11.13-18 IEG2 a specific reference to Homer, then denies that his verse will proceed from the same source as Homer's Achillean epic. He invokes the Muse, but requests assistance, not inspiration: he has witnessed the Battle of Plataea and already has his information.88 By now, the Muse-invocation was becoming a commonplace. Even some scolia have an introitic form, though drained of invocatory content (Carmm. Convivv. frs. 34b-c PMG); introits occur also in tragedy, in comedy, and later perhaps in Aristotle's verse.89 Traditional poetic ideology and all its paraphernalia must have been undermined even as symbols by the ascendancy of the alternative medium of prose, which never claimed 86 H.

WHEELER inspiration, exhibited considerable scepticism towards poetry and certainly never employed introits.90 Furthermore, philosophy was moving in new directions: Gorgias in particular prised Aoyos from reality, notoriously arguing that nothing is-and, if something were, we could not know it or communicate it. Such ideas precipitated a revolution: Ahdyos was now a manipulatory tool by which the weaker argument could be made to appear the stronger. The inspirational element in poetry-writing was sidelined. It is possible to see Alcman as feeling himself to be writing dp/trOEtS GOEoR, but scarcely Euripides. The word Mo-uaa was debased and began to denote 'song'/'poetry' generally as much as inspirational goddesses (Soph. Tr. 634-43; Eur. Ion 757). A reaction, however, tempered this revolution: What Jacob Burckhardt said of nineteenth-century religion, that it was 'rationalism for the few and magic for the many', might on the whole be said of Greek religion from the late fifth century onwards.91 Some writers at least-such as Aristophanes, who lampooned the new intellectuals- surely intended their introits to be seen as reflecting a genuine belief in the Muses (though passages such as Peace 775-96 are nevertheless formally innovative). Furthermore, introits had always possessed complex, multilayered functions, and the changes of this period probably saw at most a shift in the balance of their relative importance. The introits of Antimachus and Choerilus of Samos do not display the formal innovations seen outside epic, probably because of the influence of the Homeric texts. The introit to Antimachus' Thebaid is mostly lost: it opens with a reference to the Muses' parentage (fr. 1 Wyss), a familiar if unexciting motif; significantly, the verb VVE7e-rE is employed. Several fragments of Choerilus' Persica survive which appear to come from its opening. Fragment 2 PEG probably preceded fr. 1, which was perhaps accompanied by some reference to Choerilus' Muse (and her genealogy or dwelling- place?). The latter fragment seems conservative: an imperative petition to the Muse followed by a description, here incomplete, of the poem's subject-matter. The preceding passage is, as Aristotle says in Rhet. 1415a, an address to the audience resembling a forensic speech's preface. Choerilus, however, describes the pre-literate bard as 1"Spts (fr. 2.1 PEG), a word meaning 'knowing' (not 'inspired') never before applied to dot0Sol. It is as the legitimate successor to these dcotSol that he presents himself-a Movadowv 0pdarrov92 envying them only their broad field of operation; the vviv echoes Homer, but may merely contrast the bards' time with Choerilus'. Earlier writers such as Pindar and Empedocles had perceived the disjunction between bardic ideology and reality; now, for the first time, a poet describes his vocation in entirely un-bardic terms and seems to equate it with that professed by the bards. Alexandria and Apollonius Our final destination is Hellenistic Alexandria, where Timotheus' cry &amp;drrt'rw Movoaa raAatad (fr. 20.5 PMG) seems finally to have found its resonant frequency. Poetic 90 A. Lenz well compares and contrasts Herodotus' preface with traditional introits (Das Proom desfriihen griechischen Epos [Bonn, 1980], 268-80). 91 E. R.

Some notion of divine inspiration survived: Corinna lays claim to it, the De Sublimitate links verbal artisty with &amp;vOovataaCLds and the Parian hagiography of Archilochus was inscribed in this period.93 Yet the Hellenistic scholar-poets' claims to inspiration are generally either conceits or ironies when made at all. Aratus and Nicander have no introits. At the start of the Aetia, after a prologue that is more programmatic than invocatory, Callimachus may have contrasted traditional inspiration-theory with his own,94 though the poem did contain invocations else- where;95 his Hymns may start with rhetorical questions or apostrophai,96 never with introits. He privileges rdx'Vrm, rehearses his own erudition when questioning the Muses and implies that even they rely on external sources97 (in similar vein, Herodas' Muses are perfect readers, 3.89-92). Theocritus 16.1-4 is consciously un-Hesiodic,98 and no introit follows the proem at 17.1-2. E'ITE, BEd, prays the poet, professing only to 'carry' the Muses' songs (22.116, 223);99 but the mock-epic 24 and 25 have no introits, and the invocation at 7.148-55 is clearly a conceit. Here and elsewhere, we should not distinguish too readily Apollonius and his /dya KaKdv (to which we must now turn) from his fellows. One influence other than Alexandrianism is particularly evident in Apollonius. The shifting negotiation of the interrelationships of poet, audience, characters, and Muse seen in the Argonautica inevitably recall Gorgias and the Sophists. Apollonius exhibits their influence in other ways too: in Book 3, he associates the experience of love not only with both poetry-writing, recalling bardic ideology, but also with poetry-hearing, directly recalling Gorgias.'10 Viewed in this light, 3.179-90 echoes the Encomium as much as the Odyssey, and even the 7rEpa of Book 2 acquires new significance. Philoso- phy had overtaken the Muses; contemporary literary trends made irresistible the temptation to assign them a new role in erudite verse. The Argonautica, like the vulgate Homer, opens with mention of a god, a compound adjective, and a relative clause; like Homer and the bards, Apollonius will tell of the KAa c8L w-Bv (1.1). Several apparently formulaic phrases follow (1-4), E'gvyov ... 'Apyw' specifically echoing Od. 13.116-21 and 17.286-9. At 22, Apollonius con- servatively asks for general guidance from the Muse (not the XpLTEgS or anything else): we now appear to have passed normally from a proem (albeit one reluctant to focus on its divine subject) to the introit. In 20-2, we even have an Homeric vviv. Unlike Homer, however, the poem begins with an address to Apollo (chosen because of the importance of his oracle, or perhaps in allusion to the Aetia opening; a link with the first alternative Iliad opening is conceivable). Also, after this address, we seem to enter the narrative proper at line 5: lines 20-2 are unexpected, and y' ... .yOvr-aalC'iqv asserts Apollonius' un-bardic self-view.

WHEELER also find pv~qcropLaL, which begins or concludes twelve Hymns. One ingenious, if admittedly uncertain, suggestion is that the entire Argonautica turns out to be a proem: its ending may with some plausibility be seen as hymnic, especially 4.1773-5, which recalls the petitions and promises of future song closing many of the Homeric Hymns.1o0 Until 1.20, then, we believe that the narrative has started; until 4.1773-5, that we are reading a self-contained epic. Furthermore, scholars' quarrels have highlighted the ambiguity of 7Trofi70opes at 22 (cf. Theoc. 16.25-33, 17.115), which could make the Muses anything from Apollonius' inspirers to his intermediaries.102 He is not presented simply as their mouthpiece.103 We should avoid interpreting this mixture of traditional and novel elements as highlighting a supposed rejection of the past on Apollonius' part. He does sometimes oppose himself to Homer,10" but he, like Protagoras, may well have seen himself to a considerable extent as Homer's scion (Plat. Protag. 316d): certainly, his colleagues considered themselves competent to athetize numerous Homeric lines for drrp'rEta. Poems such as Anth. Pal. 7.55, 9.64, and 11.24 are not simply uncomplicatedly nostalgic evocations of a poetic golden age, and the Alexandrians did not necessarily view themselves simply as innovators. Apollonius' construction of his inspiration is ironic throughout the poem. The Muses could not have inspired passages such as 1.122-3, 1.135-8, 1.919-21, and 4.247-50; they are credited with granting second sight, but shortly afterwards they interrupt a traditional KAE'o-giving narrative (2.511-12; 2.844-9); and, at 2.854, daTrL is the poet's only information-source. An invocation to the Muse of '"pws begins Book 3, employing the traditional forms dye, viv, and E'VtUTE (1-3). Yet this first invocatory introit is conspicuously delayed until half of the action is over,105 and before Erato has fulfilled her commission another unexpectedly begins Book 4.106 Furthermore, Hunter has pointed out that Apollonius' use of rrapd 08' taraao (3.1) 'allots an "equal" role to his Muse','07 and has elsewhere noted the high frequency of authorial pronounce- ments, especially in Book 4.108 Echoes of Homer open Book 4: OGd, EvvrEE, Moioaa (1-2); vvv is also Homeric. Apollonius already knows two alternative stories (2-5): the Muse has merely to choose between them (as, perhaps, also at 552-6). In this book particularly, he explores his relationship with characters and Muses: he 'constantly transgresses the boundary between narrator and character',109 apologizes to the Muses before narrating the 101 S.

Interestingly, Callimachus appears to undertake the Aetia's second half alone. '06 Erato is perhaps implicitly attacked at 4.445-9. The invocation starting Book 3 may also be seen as ironic, depending upon whether one regards 1.18-22 as referring to the whole opus, a controversial question that does not admit of detailed discussion here. 107 Hunter, Argonautica Book III (Cambridge, 1989), ad loc.

Lines 450-1 are merely a rhetorical question, and at 451 Apollonius yet again asserts his control over the narrative with the first-person 'rPtv (presumably referring to himself alone). Such self-confidence, even whimsy, would have been inconceivable in Homeric verse, or even in Choerilus or Antimachus. Proems Before concluding, we must give some attention to the curious genre of pre- performance hymns, or proems. Poetic recitations given by bards and rhapsodes appear often to have been prefaced by hymnic preludes: though arguably developing from introits, these form a discrete, unified genre.111 The Homeric Hymns include numerous proems: Thuc. 3.104 describes the Hymn to Apollo as a rrpoolCptov; closing formulae portending further recitation end thirteen hymns (e.g. H.Dem. 495, H.Hom. 9.9); and the dpX- beginnings indicate opening pieces. That many hymns exhibiting such features are late is irrelevant: not all are, and those that are presumably reflect earlier practice. Wolf's suggestion that proems prefaced formal public recitations-at festivals and competitions, for instance-seems persuasive,112 though private recitations perhaps also employed them. The god hymned would perhaps be one figuring prominently in the succeeding recitation (cf. Pind. N 5.22-39), or maybe simply one whose praise was generally appropriate to the circumstances,113 though Pindar's remark that the Homeridae's recitations would begin A8 JEK rpootLOUv is Slightly disconcerting (N 2.1-5): it was perhaps common practice to hymn Zeus alone regardless of the recitation's content or context. Hymns perhaps also concluded performances (the notion seems 'degna di essere considerata'll4), but this too may have been a late development. Eighteen Hymns have first-person openings. While introits request, the Hymns' openings generally announce (ten have introits, but presumably developed them analogously). Since the ostensible purpose of Muse-invocations was to gain inspir- ation in making present objective truth, one might expect proems, the purpose of which was to praise their subject-divinities, to have had introits too, since praise essentially means relaying favourable truth, and it is curious that they do not. An examination of the Theogony's multiple introductions discloses another import- ant fact. As has long been recognized, the first two (1-35 and 36-104) are hymnic:"5 only after these do we reach the introit (105-15), following the Xalp- familiar from 26 Homeric Hymns and the request for pleasing song familiar from three of the Homeric Hymns' conclusions. The Theogony proems, however, differ from the Hymns in that 110 Frfinkel, Noten zu den Argonautika des Apollonius (Munich, 1968), ad 984 has the best discussion. II Although W H.

We may also note, following A. L. Ford (Homer [Ithaca, 1992], 24-6), that proems, being free (unlike introits) from an ideology of absolute objectivity, gave singers a unique opportunity to set a recitation in its context. 114 F C ssola, Inni omerici (Florence, 1975), xxii. 115 For similar but distinct treatments, vide Minton, 'The proem-hymn of Hesiod's Theogony', TAPhA 101 (1970), 357-77 (though Minton regards the introit as part of the proems) and R.

WHEELER they were clearly written specifically for their text.116 Parallels to the Theogony's structure abound elsewhere. Hesiod frs. 1.1-13 Merkelbach-West may preserve a proem that originally began the Catalogue; Simonides' Battle of Plataea elegy seems to have had one (fr. 11.1-20 IEG2), as does Empedocles' HlEpL O'Eows,117 while Pindar sometimes proceeds to a reference to the Muse from praise of or prayer to a deity at the start of a poem"18 and Aratus began his Phaenomena by hymning Zeus, addressing the Muses only at 16-18. Interestingly, Callimachus' Aetia ends with a proem (fr. 112 Pfeiffer), perhaps to Callimachus' Muse, though it does also function as the Iambi's opening. Addresses to pupils or dedicatees may have links with the proem genre.119 The Theogony apparently reflects an original practice of writing proems for specific works: introits, originally foreshadowing the recitation to come, may gradually have evolved into hymns to the deities to be mentioned therein,120 losing their primarily invocatory character and eventually becoming detached, requiring the insertion of new introits. This need for recapitulation explains why introits succeeded proems, which never apparently evolved far enough to acquire as a matter of course introits of their own. Proem-introits may before their detachment have resembled Erga 1-10,121 which is invocatory but of tangential relevance to the main text. The presence in longer poems, arguably straightforward hymns, of lines such as H.Dem. 495 suggests that the term wrpooutov-like our 'pr61ude'--came eventually to denote stand-alone com- positions,122 though longer proems too may have prefaced recitations.123 Interestingly, proems appear on occasion to have assumed the functions of introits in post-bardic recitations of epic texts (the tradition of poetic performance was slow to lose its vigour-Nagy claims that Homeric performances exhibited considerable textual fluidity as late as c. 150 B.C.124) and to have included requests for inspiration.125 They sometimes even displaced introits, to which they were seen as an alternative.126 Thus, ironically, the Muse-invocation's importance in oral recitation declined while introits prospered in written verse. The epic introit, then, has seen the ancient conventions surrounding its form, which had hitherto endured since bardic times in spite of the novelties seen in the other "6 E.g. E. M. Bradley, 'The relevance of the prooemium to the design and meaning of Hesiod's Theogony', SO 41 (1966), 29-47. "7 D. Sedley, 'The proems of Empedocles and Lucretius', GRBS 30 (1989), 269-96.

Vide Obbink on the juxtaposition of addresses to gods and to mortals in ancient literature (D. Obbink, 'The hymnic structure of the new Simonides', Arethusa 29 [1996], 197-9, with reservations regarding Empedocles). Interestingly, encomia of human laudandi were sometimes regarded as hymns (Theoc. 17.7-8; fr. 416 Supp. Hell.). 120 And/or to the Muses themselves: vide the Theogony proems, H.Hom. 25 and the first alternative Iliad opening. 121 Which R.
