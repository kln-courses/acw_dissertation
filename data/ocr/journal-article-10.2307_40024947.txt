This peer-reviewed anthology of ethnographic, ethno- historic, epigraphic, art historical and archaeological con- tributions is a direct result of over 14 field studies that demonstrate the relevance of caves to political, religious, and social life in Mesoamerica. The compiled research on</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 30, 2005 215 central Mexico, Oaxaca, and the Maya region also demon- strates a pan-Mesoamerican association of caves with earth, rain, and fertility. The present book stemmed from invited sessions at the 1994 meeting of the American Anthropological Associa- tion and the 1997 meeting of the Society for American Ar- chaeology, during which time the four-field approach was being debated, and the contributors sought to present the value of an ethnoarchaeological perspective. The usefulness of this book as a research tool is in bringing together, for the first time, interdisciplinary studies that independently arrive at the conclusion that the interaction between hu- man beings and the sacred landscape was, and still is, fun- damental to the belief systems of agrarian peoples of Mesoamerica. In their introductory chapter, editors James Brady and Keith Prufer provide a comprehensive discussion of the history of cave interpretation starting with J. Eric Thomp- son's first attempt to synthesize the data in 1959. Promi- nent in their discussion are the three individuals to whom the book is dedicated- Thompson, Doris Heyden, and Evon Vogt- and final publications of the latter two schol- ars appear in this volume. Despite Thompson's (1959) pi- oneering work on the ritual uses of caves in the Maya re- gion and Heyden's (1973) demonstration of the central re- ligious role of the cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, archaeologists lacked an interpretive frame- work within which these activities could be related to larg- er social systems and widespread Mesoamerican patterns. Ethnographies, with the exception of Vogt's (1981) dis- cussion of landscape use among the Maya of Zinacantan, provided data without theoretical evaluations. In the past 20 years, Brady and colleagues have forged a new disci- pline, well-represented by this volume, that integrates con- textual analysis of materials and comparative ethnographic interpretations aimed at understanding behavioral pat- terns. In Chapter 2, Heyden's study of cave rites in Prehispan- ic, early Colonial, and contemporary central Mexico points out the interconnections between religion and social life. Rituals for money, power, children's health, cleansing, and sorcery are held in caves today by many indigenous Mexi- can groups. Reciprocal offerings are placed in caves for these individual requests in a manner similar to asking per- mission to plant, harvest, hunt, or to collect water- activ- ities that are also part of the cave repertoire. Heyden's de- scriptions include several components of modern rituals that may not be detected in the archaeological record such as dancing and sweeping, and perishable offerings of flow- ers, holy water, liquor, and umbilical cords. In Chapter 3, Alan Sandstrom provides a rich, first-hand description of a 12-hour pilgrimage to caves at the summit of a sacred mountain in Northern Veracruz in 1998. The pilgrimage was conducted by the Nahua and Otomi with the goal of ending a drought believed to have been caused by the people's failure to respect the earth. Paper images of various spirits were sprinkled with the blood of sacrificed chickens and turkeys and offered with cornmeal, tobacco, flowers, palm, and candles at altars at various points along the way. Offerings were made on the mountainside to pro- pitiate malevolent spirits, at a rock fissure to the clouds, in caves for the water spirit, and at the summit to the sun fa- ther. In light of the chain of events en route to the pil- grimage site, archaeologists working in caves would be ad- vised to survey the landscape surrounding caves for corol- lary activities. Manuel Aguilar, Miguel Medina Jaen, Tim Tucker, and Brady physically located caves depicted on the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2, an historical document legitimizing Toltec-Chichimec land claims in Veracruz. Their convinc- ing argument that these artificial caves represent the Chico- moztoc, or seven caves of origin, is presented in Chapter 4. These caves, which contained evidence of Postclassic and modern use, were excavated out of the side of an escarp- ment located directly beneath the main pyramid at the site of Acatzingo Viejo. Based on ethnohistoric descriptions, the presence of seven caves legitimized settlement by sym- bolically recreating the mythic caves of origin. In Chapter 5, Janet Fitzsimmons reports on the Huatla Project's archaeological investigations in Blade Cave (Cue- va de los Pedernales). The cave contains a wealth of artifacts including human remains, Late Formative-Classic period vessels, and jade, coral, and shell beads. The context of the material is described in detail but none of the artifacts were removed so none received laboratory analysis. Fitzimmons' superficial interpretations may reflect her methods and the time in which the investigation was done (the fieldwork is almost 20 years old). Fitzsimmons links small animal bones and chert bifaces from separate contexts as evidence for blood sacrifice based on ethnographic practices. Without analysis of the faunal remains or the lithics, we cannot know if the animals were natural occupants of the caves and died of natural causes or how the blades were used. Fi- nally, assigning a single function to the cave as a "rain shrine" on the basis of an anthropomorphic stalagmite harkens back to the earlier stages of cave archaeology. This chapter appears to go against the grain of the current movement towards rigorous analysis and interpretation of data promoted by the other contributors to the volume. Despite these criticisms, this chapter adds to the informa- tion on caves in Oaxaca. In Chapter 6, Carlos Rincon Mautner discusses pic-</page><page sequence="3">216 Book Reviews tographs in the Colossal Natural Bridge (Puente Natural) of Oaxaca, a cave depicted in 16th-century documents as the place where Quetzalcoatl, the wind god, descended from heaven. The cave paintings include images of a sacri- ficial victim and a mortuary bundle suggesting that human sacrifice and honoring of deceased ancestors may have tak- en place at the site. Although previously looted, the cave contained Classic and Postclassic sherds, corn cobs, and a mountain lion femur engraved with images of deities and dead human figures inside a cave. Colonial period accounts of Mixteca cave shrines describe their use as royal ossuaries as well as places of healing and oracles. By bringing to- gether iconographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological da- ta, Rincon Mautner has greatly added to our understand- ing of a relatively poorly known region. In Chapter 7, Vogt and David Stuart employ ethno- graphic and epigraphic sources to understand Maya con- cepts of landscape. For the first time in a publication, Stu- art identifies one of the most frequent glyphs in Classic pe- riod Maya inscriptions as cVeen which is glossed as "cave," "spring," or "water-hole." The definition of this indigenous category vindicates the approach taken by field archaeolo- gists to incorporate cenotes, rockshelters, fissures, and oth- er cave features into their studies. Vogt provides a thor- ough review of the ethnographic data on the Maya of Highland Chiapas to whom caves and mountains are of central importance. Both Classic period texts and modern descriptions treat caves as places of political and communal foundation from which polities derive their names and where the cremated remains of lineage ancestors are kept in urns. In Chapter 8, Prufer sets out to address difficult ques- tions in the study of ancient religion, namely, how to dif- ferentiate between public and private rituals and between political and individual motivations. A review of the ethno- graphic and ethnohistoric literature demonstrates that in many cultures a hierarchy of ritual specialists exists to ap- peal to these various needs. Prufer draws on his extensive archaeological research in the Maya Mountains of southern Belize to show how caves are ideal contexts to explore the various roles of ritual specialists because the nuances of cave rituals are reflected in the variability of well-preserved material assemblages. Rockshelters in the vicinity of the settlement of Ek Xux, for instance, were used as locales for non-elite burials and for ceremonial activities of the politi- cal elite. The use of rockshelters and well-lit cave entrances, including construction of an artificial platform in Mayehal Xheton, suggests that these areas functioned as arenas for public rituals legitimizing the connection to the ancestors or earth deities. This use may be contrasted with the use of dark cave passages to accommodate small private rituals aimed at more individual concerns, which are reflected in artifacts identified in the ethnographic literature as shamanic tools for divination and healing. While these ty- pologies may be too simple to be applied generally, they are a good starting point to promote further research on how cave form affects function and how proximity to settle- ments affects cave use. In Chapter 9, Jaime Awe, Cameron Griffith, and Sher- ry Gibbs introduce a previously unrecorded pattern of erecting megalithic monuments in caves. They report three caves documented by the Western Belize Regional Cave Project that contain possible stelae: two slate slabs in the shape of a stingray spine and an obsidian blade in Actun Tunichil Muknal, a slate monument in Laberinto de las Tarantulas, and an upright limestone megalith surrounded by a ring of rocks in Actun Chechem Ha. While their re- view of the literature demonstrates a pattern of vertical stones and altars in caves throughout the Maya Lowlands, calling it a "cave stela tradition" [p. 240] may be prema- ture. Awe and colleagues document the placement of these monuments in recessed chambers, ledges, and other areas that are difficult to access. They appear to have been the foci of rituals involving burning. They speculate that ritu- als surrounding these monuments involved acts of blood- letting and were conducted by elites. The authors have rec- ognized an important activity associated with these in- triguing monuments warranting further investigation. Andrea Stone explores Mesoamerican spatial models in Chapter 10. After a detailed discussion of the importance of spatial patterning in architecture, iconography, cache arrangements, and ritual processions, she posits that "cog- nitive maps" must have applied to artifact distribution within caves. Specifically, Stone cites ethnographic exam- ples of ritual specialists moving from low to high spaces on the landscape to restore, maintain, or achieve balance as parallel to the use of high and low areas within caves. High shelves and deep pits within the Late Formative-Late Clas- sic Maya cave site of Naj Tunich in Guatemala may have been used in this manner. While difficult to detect archae- ologically, dry remote caves with in situ artifacts have enor- mous potential for spatial analysis and future investigations should include thorough explorations of hard-to-reach lo- cations. In Chapter 11, Holley Moyes takes on spatial analysis of the main chamber in Actun Tunichil Muknal (a cave also discussed in Chapter 9) using a Geographical Information System (GIS) to draw out cognitive maps for artifact arrangements. Like Stone, she demonstrates how caves, which were used exclusively for ritual in Mesoamerica, are ideal locations for studying formalized use of space. In the first study of its kind, Moyes proves that GIS is an effective</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 30, 2005 217 tool for detecting patterns in the cave context. Linear dis- tributions of artifacts identified as ritual pathways were dis- cerned at the four ends of the chamber and a three-stone hearth feature was found in the center. Compelling paral- lels are drawn between these arrangements and the quadri- partite division of space, which with a center, form a quin- cunx, widely described in the ethnographic literature and represented in architecture and art. Moyes further propos- es that single deposits located in peripheral areas around the circumference of the chamber serve to define the nat- ural perimeters of ritual space, functioning in ways similar to boundary markers at the edge of Yucatecan villages to- day. GIS is a useful visualization tool for cave archaeolo- gists and spatial analysis has wide applicability. In Chapter 12, Abigail Adams and Brady present ethno- graphic accounts of Q'eqchi' Maya beliefs and their value for archaeological interpretation. The overall focus of the chapter is not on actual rituals carried out in caves; it deals with issues of gender, pilgrimage, and the sacred landscape. The identification of a regional network of sacred land- marks in highland Guatemala required archaeologists to consider individual cave sites in relation to other features of the landscape including riverbanks, cliffs, boulders, and overhangs that were part of a hierarchical ritual circuit. Their finding that offerings at pilgrimage sites are often purchased locally warns that artifacts may not reflect the origin of ritual participants. Adams5 ethnographic descrip- tion highlights many aspects that may be invisible or diffi- cult to detect archaeologically, such as the simultaneous preparations that occur within the community far from the pilgrimage site or the perishable offerings of cacao, turkey broth, blood, and flowers. The difficulties in recognizing gender roles ethnographically and archaeologically are pre- sented, and although Q'eqchi' women are not permitted to enter caves, their role in mediating with the earth spirits and preparing offerings is vital and complementary to male roles. In Chapter 13, Pierre Robert Colas provides a translat- ed, edited, and thoroughly annotated English version of Jaroslaw Theodore Petryshyn's (1968) description of a La- candon cave pilgrimage conducted in 1968. Colas supple- ments the account with information gathered from Ger- man, French, and Spanish sources to provide the most complete reference on the little known cave rituals of the Lacandon Maya. These rituals are usually kept secret from outsiders, including other Maya groups, for fear that for- eign participation will offend the gods and cause natural disasters. Petryshyn's eyewitness account reveals that the focus of the rituals was to ask the gods to protect the crops from heavy rain. Communication was achieved through burning copal incense in anthropomorphic censers that embodied the gods. Human remains, broken censers, and wooden boards containing balls of copal, all observed in the caves, were a testimony to a long tradition of cave use. These insights correlate with ethnographic accounts of cave rituals in other Maya areas and are a welcome addition to the scant data on record for Chiapas. In Chapter 14, Dominique Rissolo summarizes a wealth of data collected by the Yalahau Archaeological Cave Survey in northern Quintana Roo. Because of the high water table in the Yalahau region, caves are not major water sources as they are in much of the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Rissolo demonstrates, however, that pools of water in caves were nevertheless important for their sacred qualities. Caves in the Yalahau, especially collapsed domes with naturally restricted entrances, were appropriated by the ancient Maya elite for ritual water collection as sug- gested by the presence of monumental architecture, stair- ways, and rock art. Tandem investigation of settlements in the region places caves within a larger social framework and provides insight into the cultural identity and status of participants. Rissolo also demonstrates how caves concen- trate physical evidence and can aid in the construction of regional chronologies in areas of dispersed settlement. In Chapter 15 Clifford Brown examines the relation of architecture to caves and cenotes at the Late Postclassic capital city of Mayapan. He proposes that a cave located beneath the main pyramid at the site served as an axis mun- di. It also appears that the outer defensive wall of the city deviates to include some cenotes within it, but excludes one cenote considered by the modern occupants to be no- toriously dangerous. Brown makes brief references to ar- chaeological evidence within the caves of Mayapan includ- ing human remains and a stone figurine that would suggest a ritual function. These finds corroborate his new reading of passages in the Colonial-period Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin (Edmonson 1982) that associate the caves with lineages and sacrifice. In their concluding chapter, Prufer and Brady evaluate the chapters in light of their contributions to the study of Mesoamerican religions. The major effect of this work is the recognition of caves as loci of ceremonial activity past and present, which allows investigators to formulate mod- els for understanding ritual action. Cave researchers wish to address the complexities of ritual behavior and explore how these processes are integrated into larger socio-politi- cal frameworks. The contributors to the present volume have developed appropriate methods for doing so, for in- stance by examining ritual symbols and indigenous con- cepts of natural spaces and how they were used, and by identifying aspects of ritual action and performance. The contributors demonstrate that systematic analysis of mate-</page><page sequence="5">218 Book Reviews rial culture can reveal patterning preserved in the context of caves and rockshelters, especially when combined with ethnographic evidence for perishable offerings, activities, and beliefs that are usually not found in the archaeological record. There remains the potential for speculation as to the underlying meanings of ritual action, and the data are only as good as the questions that are asked but as this book effectively demonstrates archaeological and ethno- graphic approaches can produce the best results when used in concert.
