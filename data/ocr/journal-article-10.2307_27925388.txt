MAZAR Hebrew University, Jerusalem The excavations at Tell Qas?le, which were resumed in the summer of 1971, were undertaken by the Israel Exploration Society, the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University and the Museum Haaretz, Tel Aviv. The Municipality of Tel Aviv Jaffa and donors, members of the Association of the Friends of the Museum Haaretz, sponsored the project. Prof. B. Mazar, who directed the first four seasons of excava tions at the site,1 assumed the general supervision of the project, while the excavations in the field were directed by the author. In 1971 salvage excavations were carried out on the fringes of the site and a well of the Persian period was discovered. A probe was also carried out on the mound itself.2 During this campaign the eastern end of area a, close to the eastern edge of the site, was found to be completely destroyed, by erosion and mediaeval pits. A new area, c, was therefore opened on the north-eastern part of the mound (PL 13). The discovery in this area of wide brick walls of stratum led us to suspect the existence of public buildings there, and consequently area c became our target for the next season. The fifth season of excavations at Tell Qas?le lasted from June to September 1972.3 In this season, area c was extended over 500 m2 (25 x20 m). The walls uncovered in 1 .

Most of this season's effort was therefore concentrated on ex cavating the temple and its immediate surroundings, although interesting remains were also found in other strata. A complementary sounding was carried out in the area during one week in April 1973. remains of strata i-vi in area c In the southern part of area c a circular well was found, dated to the Middle Ages. It had a wide foundation trench which cut through the southern wall of the stratum temple, destroying some of the wall and of the finds in the temple hall. Part of a public bath house was discovered in the western side of area c ; it was dated to the end of the Byzantine period (stratum Hi). The hypocaust of the caldarium, which consisted of a main room with two side chambers, was cleared (PI. 14 : A). The main chamber had an apse on its eastern side. The columns of the hypocaust were built of round or square bricks made of red clay; the floor was paved with square bricks of the same material. A thick layer of ash was found between the columns ; it con tained many fragments of pottery pipes. It is most probable that this bath house was destroyed in a. d. 614 during the Persian invasion; a silver coin of Chosroes , very rare in this country, was found in the area.4 The remains of an earlier Byzantine stratum (stratum n2) were found below the Byzantine bath house. They consisted of the foundations of several walls of a building containing two small pools. One of the pools and the eastern wall of the building caused much damage to the Iron Age strata at the western end of the temple. The Byzantine remains were found in the western part of the area only ; on the eastern side, the Iron Age walls were exposed just below the surface. The Late Roman period was not represented in area c. There were only three pits with few finds which could be attributed to the Hellenistic and Persian periods (strata iv to vi). the temple in stratum x The temple in stratum was the main Iron Age building in area c. Its good state of preservation and clear stratigraphie position make this building a key for under standing the remains of both the earlier and the later Iron Age strata. The walls of the temple are built of sun-dried mudbrick set on stone foundations and plastered with a light brown plaster. The average width of the walls is 1.2 m ; they stand to a height of 0.8 m above the floor. The building measures 8 14.5 m and by Gina Golan, Yael Marks, Deborah Netzer and A. Yoseph. The photographers were A. Hai, . Radovan and A. Glick. Students from the American Institute of Holy Land Studies in Jerusalem shared the excavation work. The last two weeks of the season were part of the curriculum for the first year students of the Institue of Archaeology of the Hebrew University. Trude Dothan and the archi tect E. Netzer gave valuable aid during the work. 4 The coin was identified by A. Kindler of the Museum Haaretz.</page><page sequence="3">TELL QASILE EXCAVATIONS, 1971-72 67 Fig. 1. is divided into two chambers: an antechamber measuring 3.7x6 m and a main hall which measures 5.65 7.20 m (inner dimensions) (Fig. 1, PI. 14 :B). The principal en trance to the antechamber is through a wide opening (2.9 m) in its northern wall. Benches made of plastered sun-dried bricks were built along the walls. The ante chamber contained fallen bricks, layers of ashes, burnt wooden beams and only a few finds. A wide opening in the western wall of the antechamber forms the entrance to the hall. Thus a 'bent axis' plan was achieved, an arrangement which prevented a direct view into the hall from the outside. In the western part of the hall is a plastered brick platform raised 0.9 m above the floor of the room, in Une with the centre of the entrance. A small compartment, 3.20x1.35 m, is separated from the hall by a thin wall ; the platform was constructed against this wall. Along the wall of the hall were built plastered benches, identical to those in the antechamber. The benches reach the platform on its northern side ; on the south the platform is approached by two plas tered steps. Two round, well-made stone pillar bases are placed at equal distances on the long, east-west axis of the hall. These bases supported wooden pillars which held the roof of the building. The imprint of the western pillar (33 cm in diameter) was found in the steps that led up to the platform, showing that the steps were built around the wooden pillar after it was set in position. Two pieces of burnt wood found on the floor of the temple were identified as cedar of Lebanon.5 A straight view from the entrance of the hall to the raised platform was achieved by fixing their position to the north of the main axis of the room on which the two pillars stood. 5 The burnt wood was identified by Nili Liphschitz of Tel Aviv University.</page><page sequence="4">68 A. MAZAR Some of the principal architectural elements of the temple resemble those of other well-known temples in Canaan and elsewhere, e.g. the temples at Lachish and Beth Shean, and a small temple recently discovered in the citadel of Mycenae.6 Basically, the Tell Qas?le temple should be defined as a long house with a 'bent axis' plan ; the layout of the rooms, entrances, raised platform and pillars, however, has no parallel and indicates original thought and planning. The temple was destroyed by a great conflagration. Two main groups of finds were revealed under a heavy layer of fallen bricks, burnt wood and ashes. The first group was found on and near the raised platform in the hall (Pl. 15 : B), and included some cult vessels.These proved highly interesting,7 despite the fact that they were found broken and scattered and that some of them were missing important parts. The upper part of one cult vessel was discovered inside the hall, while other fragments of the same object were found outside the building in front of the entrance. No valuable objects, such as jewellery, seals, etc., were among the finds ; one may assume, therefore, that the building was plundered before it was destroyed by fire. Among the most important cult objects is a pottery tablet, 23 37 cm. It is shaped like an architectural fa?ade in the Egyptian style, with two standing figures in relief. The figures themselves were destroyed and only their legs remain ; it seems that they are two goddesses, or a god and goddess, facing front. The tablet is clearly in fluenced by Egyptian ritual stelae on which gods are depicted within similar fa?ades. Near the raised platform were found two ritual incense stands. One is 45 cm high and has two storeys, each containing a row of windows (PI. 16 : A). In the upper windows is represented a row of four human figures, walking with hands outstretched and faces turned to the left. The second stand is broken at the bottom and the top. On both sides of the top of this plain cylindrical object are two standing animal figures, probably lionesses (PL 16 : B). These two animals once carried an object, pro bably a bowl, which has not been preserved. Another cult vessel from the area of the raised platform is a cone-shaped jar, of which only the upper part has been found. The jar was probably 0.7 m high ; it has a round, central opening and four smaller side openings. It is covered with a red slip and is smoothly burnished (PL 17: A). The upper part of the vessel is painted in black with a frieze of plants, probably lotus buds, shown alternately closed and opened. Under this frieze are bands decorated in net and triangular patterns, as well as a bird drawn schematically. The function of this vessel is uncertain. It may have been used as a container for liquids, but another ritual function may also be suggested. The vessel might have served as a 'flower pot' for sacred plants. Vessels having the same function and related in shape and size are represented in Near Eastern and Aegean art. 6 W. Taylour : New Light on Mycenaean Religion, Antiquity 44 (1970), pp. 270-280. This is so far the only Mycenaean temple excavated in Greece. 7 For a general description of the cult objects from Tell Qas?le see also : Museum Haaretz Bulletin 15 (1973), in press.</page><page sequence="5">tell qasile excavations, 1971-72 69 Some of the objects from the stratum temple are vessels standing on a high pedestal. One of these is a carinated bowl decorated with a bird's head, wings and tail (Pl. 18 : A). This type of bowl has two close parallels in this country and several others in Egypt. Two other unusually shaped ritual objects were found near the raised platform, as well as a rich group of pottery vessels. The latter contains a jug and two composite flasks belonging to the Bichrome group, which appeared on the Phoenician coast and in Cyprus, in the eleventh century b. c. The finds also included a strainer jug decorated with a Maltese cross, hemispherical goblets and a number of kraters, jugs, juglets, jars and bowls. A few of the bowls have a red slip and some of them a rough hand burnish. In a corner of the narrow compartment behind the raised platform was a group of ca. 80 vessels, many of which are similar to the ones found in the group just mentioned. Two types which appear here have a distinctive Philistine character; these are decorated stirrup jars and bowls with horizontal handles, ornamented with spirals. These two types may have originated in the earliest days of the temple's existence, when types characteristic of stratum xi were still in use. However, some richly dec orated stirrup jars were found in one of the rooms south of the temple, in the thick destruction layer of stratum x. We may assume, therefore, that this type continued in use until the end of this stratum. In the course of the season we also studied the location of the temple in relation to its surroundings. It became clear that only the southern side of the temple was built against existing structures. These were already standing in stratum xi, and were re built in stratum x. Parts of seven rooms were discovered, rich in finds, among them the equipment of a bakery ? grinding stones, a kneading trough and what is probably a brick oven. It is not clear whether or not these rooms belonged to the temple com plex. Like most of the other buildings in stratum x, they were destroyed by a heavy fire. A small room with stone walls was attached to the northern side of the temple. It was entered from the south-west corner, near the temple wall. The finds in this room consisted of storage jars, a chalice and a few bowls, which were found beneath a heavy layer of destruction. To the west of this room was an open area, possibly a street. The eastern wall of the room continues northwards and serves as the western limit of the temple courtyard. This courtyard was paved with beaten earth and covered the whole excavated area north and east of the temple up to a distance of at least 5 m from its walls (PI. 15 : A). A square stone foundation, 1.2 1.2 m, was built in this courtyard against the northern side of the temple. This may have served as a base for an altar for sacrifices such as we might expect in this area. To the east of the courtyard were found some votive vessels, one of which, a small hand-made juglet, has a neck decorated with a bearded male face ; this may represent a deity, since the head is adorned by what seem to be rams' horns. the remains of strata - Only a few sections were cut into the earlier levels of area c. One section was dug below the floor in the temple area. At least one wall discovered here is part of an</page><page sequence="6">70 A. MAZAR earlier building belonging to stratum xi. It had a different plan from that of the stratum temple. Very little of the earlier building is known as yet. Below the courtyard of the temple were two walls with a section of floor containing pottery characteristic of stratum xi. Of special importance is a circular pit which was clearly sealed by the pavement of the courtyard and the stone foundation of the 'altar'. The pit contained a broken anthropomorphic vessel, 33 cm high, represent ing a female figure, probably a goddess (PI. 17 :B). Its general appearance is heavy and rather crude. The face is rough, the eyes are painted black, the hands are placed on the front of the vessel and the nipples serve as spouts. Another important find from the same circular pit is a pottery rhyton in the shape of a lion's head with an open mouth ; it is richly decorated in red and black paint on a buff slip with Philistine de signs (PI. 18: B). Four other rhyta of this kind are known from this country and have been attributed by Trude Dothan to the Philistine culture.8 The pit also contained a rich collection of pottery vessels, including two bottles and an elaborately decorated horn-shaped vessel, which are part of the Philistine repertoire. It seems that the pit served for the burial of the anthropomorphic vessel and that the cult objects found in it belonged to an earlier temple which probably existed in this area in stratum xi. REMAINS OF STRATA IX-VIII The structural remains of strata ix-vm were found just below the surface and large parts of them were completely destroyed by later trenches and pits. The scanty evidence remaining shows that the northern wall of the temple was rebuilt in stratum ix with brown-red bricks, and a new floor of thick lime was laid in the area of the open courtyard. This floor sealed off the square stone foundation (of an altar?) in stratum . The 'altar' was replaced by a round installation of big stones, built nearby, perhaps for the same purpose. Above the destruction layer of the temple itself, we discovered layers of sand which were deposited during a period in which the area remained unoccupied.9 On top of these layers was found a small section of a thin lime floor which con nects, through the temple's entrance, with the thick lime floor in the courtyard. In the next phase, to which only a few finds can be attributed, the eastern and northern walls of the temple were rebuilt with massive stones laid on top of the ear lier brick walls. Two stone walls north of the temple are attributed to this phase. Only a few sherds can be related positively to this last phase and therefore it is difficult to fix its exact date. It may belong to stratum iXj or to stratum vin.10 Although no cult objects were unearthed in the strata above, it is clear that the in habitants of the site tried to conserve the general layout of the temple, which may have 8 Trude Dothan; The Philistines and their Material Culture, Jerusalem 1967, pp. 177-180 (Hebrew). 9 These layers were investigated by the geologist Y. Yitzhaki of Tel Aviv University. !0 After further research it now seems that the final rebuilding must be attributed to stratum vm. Yet the small quantity of pottery from this phase prevents a final decision.</page><page sequence="7">tell qasile excavations, 1971-72 71 continued to serve as a cult centre. In the southern part of the area, just below the surface soil, were found unstratified, washed layers of earth containing pottery from stratum vu, the last Iron Age stratum of Tell Qas?le. the eastern fringe of the site In order to study the fringe of the site to the east of area c, a small section was opened in square 66dl. We reached bedrock immediately below the surface soil. Two pits containing a few early Iron Age sherds were found in the bedrock. The type of cook ing pots found in these pits may be attributed to stratum xn. Various pits of the same kind were found in previous seasons. There are no remains of any fortifications in this section. conclusion The temple at Tell Qas?le is the only building of its kind which can be attributed to the Philistine culture. The architectural remains of the temple, and the cult objects and various finds discovered in and around it, will increase our knowledge of the Philistines and their material culture. There are few biblical references to Philistine temples. The best known is the story of Samson's destruction of the temple in Gaza : 'And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left' (Judges 16:29). The temple at Tell Qas?le fits this biblical description very well, since the two wooden pillars were a most important part of its construction. The ostracon found at Tell Qas?le 26 years ago carries the inscription : 'Gold of Ophir to Beth Horon ... thirty shekels'. This led Prof. B. Mazar to suggest in his preliminary report that a temple of the god Horon existed at or near Tell Qas?le, and that it is this temple, rather than the city of Beth-Horon, that is mentioned in the inscription.11 Since the ostracon is dated later than the 10th century b.c., the possible connection between it and the temple discovered during the 1972 season remains an open question ; the ostracon might be connected with the last use of the area as a cult centre, in stratum vm. A comparison of the plans of the three excavated areas at Tell Qas?le shows that the city had parallel streets dividing rectangular blocks of buildings. This is the only example of such elaborate city planning in this period. The general layout of the city, the clear stratigraphy of the site and the discovery of the temple with its unique finds make Tell Qas?le a most interesting site for the study of the Early Iron Age in this country.
