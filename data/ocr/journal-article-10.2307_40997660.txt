Reviewed by: Luciana Villas Boas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil One of the main assumptions of landscape studies is that representations of landscape and nature lend themselves to epochal reformulations of subjectivity. By focusing attention on the early modern period and drawing upon a variety of materials, the collection of essays selected and introduced by Dominique de CourceUes sheds new light on this assumption. Thus the particular choice and assemblage of natural elements allow different historical subjects to observe themselves as both the origin and effect of their landscape experiences. Each of the four parts into which the book is divided approaches a shift in the representa- tion of landscape and its constitutive elements, from a strikingly broad range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The first section, misleadingly entitled "De la nature sauvage à la belle nature," indi- cates not the refiguring of nature from forsaken wilderness into crafted beauty, but rather the conventions underlying the representation of space within different genres. Santiago López-Ríos describes how the forests, and their lurking wolves, embody the locus horridus within fifteenth-century Castilian texts, ever since the Cantar de Mio Cid. While the occa- sional identification between wolves and nobles indicates its political charge, this highly conventional landscape complies with an exclusively fictional narrative economy. Cathy Yandell demonstrates how Pierre de Ronsard s floral metaphors reach beyond their rhetor- ical definition as ornaments to become the prime matter of poetic aestheticization. In adding flowers to classical sources, and lending them new, subjective overtones, Ronsard allows them to "take part in the construction and amplification of the creative conscience, from the buds of the first odes to the dried out petals of the Derniers vers" (38). According to Philipe Desan, the landscape depicted in Montaigne's Journal de Voyage does not under- score the existence of nature in its own right, but rather reveals the discrete elements defined by the traveler s point of view. Montaigne's particular admiration of gardens as artful collection of nature's diversity, for instance, signals the subjection of nature to man's contrivance. The second section, "Le voyage allégorique et la révélation poétique du sujet," approaches the allegorical voyage as a medium for the articulation of the poetic subject. After discussing traditional renderings of the temple, the desert, or the forest, Juan Carlos Conde shows that the landscape in the Siervo Libre de Amor and other sentimental novels conventionally reflects the protagonists' sentiments, and that the contemplation of this reflection significantly affects him in return. Carlos Vecce argues that, in the sixteenth cen- tury, the tradition of bucolic poetry epitomized in Sannazar's Arcadia is put into the service of courtly self- fashioning through the disguise of the courtier and poet as shepherd. Right after playing the author qua actor at the center of his work, Sannazar draws on Theocritus s authority to deviate from Vergil's prevailing model, bringing his idyll to the present time, and thus completing his own personal initiation rite, or "bildungsroman" (91). Hélio Alves' beautiful essay on Bernardim Ribeiros Menina e moça stresses the text's deviance from rhe- torical dispositio and elaboration of a sentimental topography, whose natural elements are blurred with the image of the nameless speakers. In the light of medieval conceptions of authorship, Alves argues that these various images imply at once the dispersal and the artic- ulation of the author as a discursive entity projected onto space. Mercedes Blanco explores the simultaneity of the artistic promotion of the landscape and the writing of Góngora's</page><page sequence="2">1 196 Sixteenth Century Journal XLI/4 (2010) Soledades, drawing not upon iconic resemblances, but rather upon the artful recreation of purely literary traditions. Abstaining from the marvelous and reworking conventions, Gón- gora's unique assemblage of repertoires precludes the domination of history over space, of the figures over the setting. In making the poem resist appropriative readings, Góngora cre- ates a poetic landscape in its own right. The section titled "De la quête spirituelle à la magie naturelle," highlights the conjunc- tion of religion and nature. Daniele Duport describes how Clement Marot s Le Temple de Cupido transforms the conventional landscapes of conversion narratives and their allegori- cal framework. Drawing on previous parodist traditions and the contemporary trend towards the interiorization of faith, Marot s distortion of secular and religious genres turns laughter into a privileged means for finding religious truth. In a carefully contextualized reading of Marguerite de Navarre's Êpître de Cauterets, Rosanna Gorris Camos describes how the emotions provoked by the "unspeakable heights" (163) of the mountain usher in the spiritual reformation of the self. Moreover, Navarre s epistle differs from the typical humanist defense of the mountain, to articulate an experience of seeing that ultimately leads from the variety of the world to the unity of the soul. Dominique de Courcelles dwells upon the assumption of both Platonic philosophy and natural magic that the study of phys- ical nature yields to theological insight, and spiritual asceticism. The writings of the Castil- ian friar Luis de León blend ancient and Christian traditions to give the reader insight into the coincidence between God and his work, while the poems of Jean de la Croix, a possible disciple of León, exacerbate the notion that mystical experience culminates in the contem- plation of natures secrets. The last and most ambitious section, "La conquête des mondes naturels, pour une nouvelle subjectivité," juxtaposes ars memoria, painting, anthropomorphism, and colonial- ism. Highlighting the typographical, visual dimension of the printed book, Tom Conley likens the movable image of the text to that of a landscape. Hence, studied as an archipelago, Montaigne's essays reveal their mnemonic arrangement. Montaigne's circumlocution or "veuë oblique" amounts to a record of an ars memoria, inviting the reader of the essays, much like that of an isolano, to grasp both the real and virtual itineraries of words. Lizzie Boubli explores how the topographic views of Greco's Vue et plan de Tolède and Laocoon break away from the corpus of sixteenth-century engravings of the city. Drawing on Greco's annotations in copies of Vasari and Vitruvius, Boubli discusses to what extent these paint- ings articulate Greco's redefinition of painting. While echoing other mannerist theories, Greco's conception departs more radically from Renaissance theories, for subordinating lit- erary sources to the "ver del pintor" and the specificity of his craft. Frank Lestringant dem- onstrates how in the context of the Counter- Reformation the wake of anthropomorphic landscapes encompasses a range of attitudes. While in the work of André Thevet and Olaus Olearus the equivalence between the landscape and human forms is merely suggested, in that of François Rabelais, the boundary between macrocosmos and microcosmos becomes malleable. While Belon du Mans collapses anthropomorphism with nature, Athanasius Kircher limits it to a fortuitous light effect. All the same, argues Lestringant, in the geogra- phy of the Counter- Reformation "la Terre mime l'apparence de l'homme pour tout à la fois l'instruire, le rassurer et l'assujetir à un pouvoir souverain" (278). Chantai Caillavet tackles how the holiness of the landscape in the North of the Andes combines indigenous legacies with Christian appropriation. Retracing this juxtaposition of beliefs, Caillavet argues that converted spaces can be seen as sites of memory in which both native and Christian colo- nial elements are entangled. Within its broad, yet also nuanced scope, the connection between selfhood and land- scape pursued in Courcelles s collection is not always fully revealed. Yet its overall historical</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1197 accuracy and scholarly quality, together with its strong interdisciplinary outlook, should appeal to all early modernists fortunate to read Romance languages. «oso %J cae*</page></plain_text>
