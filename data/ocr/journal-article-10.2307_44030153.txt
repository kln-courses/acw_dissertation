The real fear generated by the outbreak concerns "the evident permeability of the species boundary," which in turn forces a re-thinking of "the human" and of humanist self- conceptions, with all of the binaries and boundaries - "division, categorization, and hierarchization" - on which Western epistemologies have depended. Tiffin's remarkable essay is an indicator of the compass of this issue, the second of two Mosaic special issues on "the animal." As in the first issue, so in this one, the ques- tion of "the animal" has to do inevitably with "apparent transgressions" of certain closely guarded boundaries, and with conceptual and ecological failures that stem from a refusal to break these boundaries down. Some of the following essays deal specifically with ecocritical and environmental concerns - for instance, in Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Barthes, Marx, and Haruki Murakami's fiction. The issue also offers significant analyses of "animality" in the Western literary and critical tradition, along with re-assessments of anthropomorphism - in the fiction of Coetzee, for example, that of Jack London, and Rebecca West. Discourses of nation and post-nationalism are broached in these "animal" essays. You will find a discussion of Aesop's lion here; a study of medieval ani- mal trials; and history of cybernetics alongside a history of bears. It strikes me as somehow fitting that in an issue that does so much to challenge cultural and institutional binaries, an interview in the Mosaic "Crossings" series should appear. We are very pleased to open this issue with "Crossings: An interview with John Sallis."
