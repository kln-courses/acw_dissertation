<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Legacy of the West THE JAPANESE UNIVERSITY STUDENT CONFRONTS RELIGION: PART II by ALFONSO M. NEBREDA, S.J. IN the assertions of the youths of Japan, presented in a previous article,1 we have des- cribed the university students' apathy and hostility toward religion. We have examin- ed some of the causes of this apathy and hostility, among them the failure of the traditional religions and the phenomenon of the new religions. In this article I want to examine the influence from the West. Any visitor can witness the profound westernization of contemporary Japan. Today Japan is a country whose newspapers, journals and thousands of illustrated publications are read by old and young alike; there is a frenzy of enthusiasm around movie and television stars and sports heroes. Fashion, hair-dressing, entertainment are continually changing in the city as well as in the countryside. Everything marks Japan with the unmistakable trends of mass civilization. Since this modern civilization arose in the West and continues to show the characteristics ofits origin, the investigation methods appropriate for the West should be applied in all industrialized countries.2 Before we start our analysis, we should beware of the danger of being misled in thinking that Japanese modernization is a recent postwar phenomenon brought about by the cata- clysm ofthe lost war and the occupation. It is evident that the postwar situation favored the process and that with drastic reforms offundamental structures there has been an extension and depth not present before. The change is mainly in the attitudes due to the loss of a world vision based on traditional values that were recognized as universally valid.3 It is clear that the crisis of I945 had a catalytic function in forcing this powerful evolution. But the process is almost a century old, having its inception from July I853 when Com- modore Matthew C. Perry appeared with his famous "black-ships" in Edo Bay to bring a MTHE AUTHOR is Professor of Religion at Sophia University. He studied at the Gregorian Uni- versity in Rome (D.D. I96I), where he also taught. He has contributed numerous articles and monographic studies on the religion situa- tion of Japan. 1 See Monumenta Nipponica, 20 (I-2), I5-40. 2 The book of Frank Gibney, Five Gentlemen of 7apan, Tokyo, 1954, is, in its line, an exception to the many things that have been written on Japan, especially after the last war, more or less catering to the exotic and anecdotical. Fr. Joseph Roggendorf has summarized some of the conclusions that may be drawn from the book of Gibney: See Monumenta Nipponica, IO (I954), 290. 3 Joseph Roggendorf, s.j., "Die Kirche in Japan-Romantik und Wirklichkeit," Stimmen der Zeit, I59 (I956/57), i85-i86. Few have been able to make such an accurate diagnosis of the origins and character of the crisis of the Japanese civilization as Prof. Roggendorf. This is why in the following discussion we shall freely borrow from his various articles on this theme.</page><page sequence="2">NEBREDA: The Legacy of the Wvest: 299 forced conclusion to the closed-door policy. After that Japan has modernized as no other nation before or since.4 During this process of modernization Japan experienced a deep revolution in the social, economic, political, military and educational spheres. The Japanese leaders thought they could make ofJapan a state capable offacing other nations and of conversing on equal terms with the powers of the West. It was a revolution in society and government, but a revolu- tion which, in contrast to those of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Europe, was not effected by the lower classes but was carefully planned by a small elite at the head of the state. These gifted leaders were for the most part cautious and far-sighted. Led by their desire to make Japan a strong and modern nation, they had sent men, hand-picked for their capa- bilities, to those countries in the West which were thought most outstanding in cultural and technical development. The entire world became for them "an immense study-room and they entered it determined to learn only the best in each field."5 Although they chiefly intended to learn the ways to power and efficiency, they could not prevent a decisive western impact on all cultural institutions. Joseph Roggendorf has written about the modern Japanese novel in the following manner: "It is not related at all to the classic narrative of the old literature. With the excep- tion of the masterpieces by the great writers such as Shimazaki or Natsume, one finds in them hardly any traces of the literary prose derived from the classic poetry. In an exasperating monotony, the most popular novel writers develop their action in the tea-houses of the happy world; as a critic noticed it not long ago, they are quite in keeping with the blatant sensuality and heavy naturalism of those novels by Zola which date from his weakest years. It is frequent even today that the intel- lectual man in Japan should prefer the translation and even the original of a foreign literary work to those of his own country. 'Faustischer Meulsch, Ubermensch,"dialectics of the spirit' and 'absolute nothing,' theories of evolution and relativity are notions with which the heads of the educated people are crammed, and they are more familiar with them than with those conceptions of the past, even though they may only be able to handle them in an arbitrary and superficial way. The dialectic theology, the existentialism of Europe are already-or still-in fashion. Lawrence, Joyce, Proust, Thomas Mann, Faulkner and Hemingway have for a long time now found their translators and admirers. The official consecration which theNobel Prize has recently given to Hess and Gide has not surprised theJapanese public at all. Their works have 4 For this fascinating period of Japanese history see G.B. Sansom, The Western World and 7apan, New York I95o; E.H.

Piovesana, an historian of Japanese modern philosophy, writes that a study of contemporaryJapanese philosophy is almost the same as a study of the influence of western philosophies in Japan. Kant and Hegel are the prominent philosophers, not Buddha, Con- fucius or Indian thinkers. Scholars can quote the German terminology pertinent to Marx's superstructure and infrastructure while they remain unfamiliar with their own eastern categories.7 The profound westernization of modern Japan is a too evident fact. Before examining more in detail the circumstances under which it took place, we can profitably examine the European "authorities" that have been most influential in the modernization process. Tanaka Kotaro, a legal scholar and former Minister of Education and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, offers a significant synthesis. He summarizes the important ideas of the eighteenth century positivism and nineteenth century antimetaphysical tendencies im- ported from Europe. "In the field of politics, Montesquieu and Voltaire were regarded as authorities outside discussion; in the field of political economics and sociology, August Comte, Spencer and Mill; in the field of natural science, Darwin and Huxley."8 Tanaka observes that the main influence in early Meiji political thought came from the natural law theory as taken from J.J. Rousseau's Contrat Social, as if this were the only ex- ponent of French thought. This point of view was so deeply rooted in the Japanese people that even the famous Professor Boissonade from Paris, a legal adviser to theJapanese govern- ment, failed to make them understand that there could be other interpretations of the natural law theory."9 The English utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill, the sociology of Herbert Spencer, and the evolutionism of Huxley and Darwin were also very influential. "In a transition period in which material progress was taken as the sole object of the state and society, it was natural that positivism and rationalism should be re- 6 Joseph Roggendorf, "La crise de la civilisa- tion japonaise," Le Bulletin des Missions, XXIII (I947), 237. 7 Gino K.

Johannes Siemes, "Present-day Philosophy in Japan," Missionary Bulletin, 5 (I951), I-7 (hereafter quoted as MB), confirms the point of view expressed by Fr. Piovesana. The recent book of Gino K.

A Survey, Tokyo I963, while pointedly nuancing the widespread contention thatJapanese thought has scarcely gone beyond a mere introduction of western ideas without any originality, still stresses the point we are making here: "Recent Japanese philosophical thought, means in Japan, predominantly, if not exclusively, the Western type of philosophical thinking, as is explained in the book itself."

The experience of revolutions and wars which have long since obliterated the easy image which the nineteenth century made of the world has not yet been understood in Japan."11 Having as a background this historical summary of the milieu in which youths move, we shall be better prepared to judge the religious attitude of our university students. Whether they realize it or not, they have been born and have grown up in that atmosphere. And indeed, reading i5o of their essays on religion, one can feel that he is a witness of the whole process by which the many "isms" and theories have successively had the upper hand in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although the various ingredients have settled into a kind of living unity, for the sake of greater clarity we are going to present here the three aspects which we believe are the main ones. They are: I Relativism and pragmatism with their repercussions on religious ideas and in parti- cular on the morals and postwar Japanese education system. 2 Naive liberalism with its blind faith in abstract humanity, in liberty (democracy) and progress. 3 And finally the agnostic and scientistic positivism of men like Comte and Feuerbach. (I RELATIVISTIC PRAGMATISM THE Japanese oligarchs who built up the new state were guided by their own education and convictions and by the very historical occasion itself: the necessity to create as soon as possible a powerful and modern Japan. The fact is that as unbiased a man as Sir George Sansom has said: "It will be difficult to find in the Far East a group more pragmatic and utilitarian than the ruling elite ofjapan in that epoch."12 For that reason we do not find it strange that a man such as Fukuzawa Yukichi and the 10 Ibid., pp. 38-39. 11 J.

MB 7 (I953), I7I-I72. 12 Sansom, The Western World and 7apan, p. 466. The author shows convincingly how this pragmatical attitude dominated both the government and the opposition, as well as the translators, the technicians, the teachers and the industrial leaders.

Fukuzawa, founder of Keio University and a prolific writer (i so volumes), is the best symbol of a nation which is beginning to come into world prominence. The champion of Enlightenment, departing from Spencer's agnostic philosophy, professed the most absolute materialism. His success was fabulous. By I900, twelve million copies of his works had been sold. Cham- berlain, the well-known specialist in Japanese matters, wrote in the I920'S that "without exaggeration Fukuzawa can be called the spiritual father of more than half of the men who direct this country's affairs.14 Once the young nation was led into the path of a pragmatism which each day logically affirms itself more and more,15 it could not extricate itself; even the cataclysm of the last war did not chlange the situation. Stoetzel has shown that what the Japanese public appreciates most, almost exclusively we might say, in the western countries, is the element of material power and, more par- ticularly, technology.16 Out of 2,67I replies to the Stoezel questionnaire 2,393 gave such answers. Moreover, this tendency is in this respect even more manifest among the young. We cannot deny the truth of the conclusion drawn by Stoetzel: "These results clearly reveal the idea which Japan entertains of the West and allow us to infer Japan's own opinion of how it compares with Christian industrial civilization, which it regards as pow- erful materially and thereby enviable, but not truly cultivated and a little lacking in soul."17 But without intending to question the truth of this vision so deeply rooted in the East, that the only strength of the West is its material power and that it lacks inner life, we might also be allowed to say that the admiration and envy which the Japanese show for the tech- nical and material values prove once more that modern Japan is in danger of forgetting its own soul and has tended to put itself at the service of western pragmatism. In the previous article, we have been able to feel the energetic protest of the students against the abuses that the old and above all the "New Religions" made of that pragmatic vision of the Japanese, applied to religion. The examples could be multiplied. Let two suffice. "Up to now I had hardly ever thought about religion. And it was because the believers, Christians or from other religions, that I had seen near me-all of them- 13 See Piovesana, "Main Trends," p.

And therefore, it seems to me that those people believe in God only to escape from their problems and worries." The following opinion is even more eloquent. "This is something which, it seems to me, all the Japanese of my age feel when they speak about religion, namely, they think first of all of results CkJkaD. What is re- ligion good for? This is the first question one asks inJapan in this respect. This, I be- lieve, is the great defect of the Japanese confrontation of religion. One thinks: by means of religion one can obtain what he desires; and thus one believes in order to obtain that object. But will this be the meaning and object of religion? I cannot be- lieve this is true. I do not believe that religion has survived for so long having that as its guiding principle. . .." If we contrast this text with the next sample in which another Japanese speaks from the opposite standpoint, that is to say, boldly stating and praising what the previous one deplores as a fault, we shall obtain an exact vision of the actually existent mentality through- out Japan in respect to religion: pure pragmatism. "Is not religion, like the other aspects of culture, reduced to a kind of means for obtaining man's happiness? It may be that originally it was not so, but at least at pre- sent,its efficacy and its very reason for existence seems to me to be nothing else than this.... Religion is no exception (to egoism which is the ultimate explanation of everything human) and therefore, if there were no advantages to be gained by using it, I do not believe so many people would cling to it. I cannot conceive of a human activity which transcends the binomial gain-loss (son-toku9." I have added stress in order to point out all the more sharply this which seems to be the uppermost thought in the consciousness of youth in Japan. The foregone conclusion is that no other values exist outside of efficiency and profit. Consequently, this mentality is almost inaccessible because the ideology is fixed in their minds since infancy. They can- not be expected to go beyond superior pragmatism. Religion has always been considered in the Orient from the anthropocentric point of view. People have continually expected religion to build personality and to support personal weakness. Pragmatism is accompanied by a deep religious relativism. Expressions such as the following do not astonish us: "Though brought up in a Protestant atmosphere my attitude toward religion was rather hostile. These months at Sophia have made me change a great deal. But I still have some doubts. This is the first; there are different religions in the world today and the followers of these religions all seem to believe their own is the best, of absolute value. And thus they go to make proselytes among people who already have some kind of religion. Why is this? Here is my opinion: ifin them one seriously regards God as an object of adoration, and unless the sects are not evidently mis- taken Cjashiu and prove to be so by common sense, it does not seem to me any</page><page sequence="7">304 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 problem should exist as to whether the God they adore is Christ, Mohammed or Buddha. I do not see why proselytism should be necessary." The world of today is characterized by a devaluation of the word, as Fr. Danielou has noticed, by a lack of confidence, almost inveterate, in language. Today's youths, tired of so many ideologies, want to come into contact with the facts, the concrete realities.18 But the very same Fr. Danielou has also said that another of the characteristic features of the present crisis of truth is the substitution of the new criterion of efficacy in the place of truth.19 Japan in this respect, too, harmonizes perfectly with the western world. One thing is certain, and it carries with it a light of hope: namely, the pragmatism of our youth abhors and instinctively repudiates the most materialistic forms, so common in the manifestations of popular religion. The manifold testimonies analyzed so far are suf- ficient evidence to eliminate all doubts in this respect. It is undeniable that some of the manifestations of the new religions have at least shown to modern youth what religion ought not to be. But these young people have been brought up in an atmosphere "where the problem of truth ... is not presented." What Fukuzawa Yukichi once said describes the general attitude of the Japanese: "I regard the representatives of the different religions as tea sellers. After all one can even do without tea: at any rate, it is up to everyone to decide upon the brand of tea to suit his taste. But in no case, should one trust the ponderous propaganda of the seller."20 The consequences of this pragmatic relativism, however, are also felt in the field of education and morality. Fr. Gheysen makes a most significant remark with regard to the Sunday Schools. The children, after having spent Sunday at the school, go back home and say to their parents: "Ichinichi son shimashita" (I have wasted a day), without learning any reading, writing, or arithmetic.21 The wave of immorality and hedonism which little by little enveloped Japan through the postwar years reached its zenith in the socalled Taiy)zoku (The Sun's Tribe). This name was taken from the novel by Ishihara Shintara who received the national literary prize, Akutagawa sho in i9556, for Taiyjno kisetsu (The Sun's Season).22 The story manifested 18 Jean Danielou, "Le scandale de la verite," Etudes, 304 (I960), 3-17. 19 Ibid., pp. 7-8. 20 Quoted in Joseph Roggendorf, "Funfzig Jahre Jesuiten in Japan," Stimmen der Zeit, I63 (I958/59), 40-4I. 21 Cf.

The characteristics of the "Sun's Tribe" are, ac- cording to Uyttendaele, "an a-moral, or even anti-moral attitude, a radical pragmatism, a gambling spirit, a vitalism based on a free- spending hedonism, an anti-social sense and athe- ism."

The Ministry of Education determined in spite of all opposition to impose the teaching of rinri (ethics) in all schools during the years of compulsory education.23 Among the educators there were some who believed that the new system of education imposed by the Americans was to blame for the situation. In fact, when in I952 the American Commission came again to observe the results of its reforms. "the severest criticism that it received was that in its previous orientations, that is, in the sketch given as the Fundamental Law of Education, there was no norm, not even an insinuation, about moral education."24 The answer from the Commission was characteristic: "virtue," they said, "is not to be taught but to be learned from life." Others, on the other hand, among the Japanese edu- cators maintained: "That morality has not been degraded but the criterion of good and evil only changed in the course of time."25 Finally, the opinion of a famous thinker in Japan, Hasegawa Nyozekan, is well worth quoting from his long article on "Morality and Its Reality" which appeared in Gendai rinri (Modern Ethics).26 This octogenarian champion of democracy justly labels the situation of postwar Japan "tlhe age of confusion and disturbance."27 But when he sets down what he thinks to be the norm of that "scientific" morality which Japan so badly needs, we see he has an in- genious utopian way of claiming for that kind of ethics the "scientific" constancy which is to be found only in the natural sciences.28 One is impressed by the absence of clear ideas about what can be the foundation of solid virtue with regard to morality.

There are no cries of rebellion, but the conse- quences of the revolt of contemporary Japanese youth: amorality, fights, joie de vivre, search of an individuality, sex frenzy; in a word, "an easy, sceptical youth, unconsciously suffering from its own isolation without understanding it."

The author presents the common sense of the people as the force of equilibrium in the present moral chaos. Such common sense, he thinks, will justly limit the unrealistic ideas of transcendental idealism.29 Tanaka Kotar6, on the other hand, affirms that such morality is not necessarily the consequence of the war; its deepest root must be sought in the character of Japanese culture since the Meiji era. Above all the traditional attitude towards education as found in high positions is res- ponsible for relativism.30 For that reason, in spite of praiseworthy intentions, the Ministry of National Education was condemned beforehand to a fundamental sterility. The basic regulation on the new compulsory course of ethics, DJtoku kyJiku no tame no tebiki-shoyoko, well illustrates the vicious circle intrinsic to moral relativism. "The main goal of education is to build up an independent man, autonomous, capable of integrating himself within a democratic society and of contributing to its progress; though in the concrete situation it is not determined what that man ought to be like. The demands of society itselfhave to determine it. That is, gradual- ly, it will become evident as the overall thought of a nation which contributes to the progress and prosperity of society."'31 After this vague introduction, there follow the official texts, stating what kind of moral ideas shall be taught. It is a brief compendium of the history of moral philosophy and the students who read it will probably reach the conclusion that morality is constituted by contradictory ideas out of which no moral norm can be deduced. N. Luhmer, an educator of long experience in Japan, said in his appraisal of the situation that the ultimate criterion of moral behavior has been changed into the people's affirmation from an utilitarian point of view; that is, that the act be profitable for the material prosperity of society. If this is so, the basis of the human moral actions is human opinion so that the ultimate criterion of good and evil depends on utility to promote material progress."32 Most students are of the opinion that the concept of good and the concept of evil are subjective, so that each person must decide in his own heart what he may, can, ought to do. 29 Ibid. 30 Tanaka K6tar5 w111 12 "Kyoiku to rinri" *j$ft e 4fil (Education and Moral), in Kobayashi-Erlinghagen, Gendai seikatsu rinri koza, iII, Kyoiku to rinri, p. 8. 31 Quoted in Luhmer, "Dotoku ky6iku," pp. I23-I24. 32 Ibid., p.

The idea of an absolute norm is completely unthinkable for them, however much good may be done on the basis of this con- ception in other parts of the world. Japanese youths are not prone to accept any simplicist moral doctrine; but at the same time, they see the inconsistency of those who want to impose norms which have no real value. And Fr. Luhmer wisely remarks that arbitrary norms and standards will have no practical results for lack of motivation capable of making youths observe the code proposed to them.33 When disciplined by university authorities at one Tokyo campus, the students protested: "What we call virtue is not something imposed on us by superiors. It is something that we agree to accept by mutual accord. We agree that strangers are not to be hurt. To protect society from disturbances such agreement is necessary. Thus, in that way we are practicing virtue."34 CII RATIONALISTIC LIBERALISM PRAGMATISM is joined by the trend of rationalistic liberalism of long standing. Fukuzawa had already spoken of liberty, of personal independence and of the importance of positive and useful study as steps toward securing liberty. From i868 to i88o the Japanese scene was fully controlled by the English type of liberalism. Many of the works of John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer were translated,35 and all thinkers in Japan spoke about liberty, reason and the parliamentary sytem. Optimism was in the air. During the next decade German idealism, especially the thought of Kant and Hegel,36 became powerful in the mental formation of public leaders. Yet the national tendencies were not to be quickly altered from the liberalistic pattern first established by the influx of European culture.37 It is interesting, on the other hand, to verify the fact that even today a considerable percentage of Japanese men do not believe that the new concept of liberty which un- doubtedly has become dominant in postwar Japan is in any way a true solution for keeping continuity with the traditional culture of the country.38 Dr. Tanaka has unmasked the abuses perpetrated in the name of democracy where liberty is interpreted as an unmitigated and exaggerated individualism,39 allowing no room for a correct sense of liberty based on the idea of responsibility. He would have citizens reflect that the authentic concept of moral dignity of man as a person is fundamental, and that the people must correct their 33 Luhmer, "Mombusho Circular Letter on Moral Education," p. 478. 34 A.

In its place, the broadest liberalism, based on a mistaken conception of the individual's rights, has now brought about the anarchy and dissolution of the social order. And that liberalism is called "progressive." The actual situation of Japan is the loss of "ego" as a center of personality, and consequently there has been an unconditional capitulation, no less spiritual than military.42 Next the author examines the anarchy in morality. It is a kind of liberty, in the name of a liberalism which no longer exists except in books, but which the Japanese of the postwar era began to preach as the last word of progressivism. Words such as obligation and responsibility were regarded as suspicious and attacked as reactionary, militarist, ultranationalist .... On the contrary all the talk was about the "State-culture" or the "new moral," and this without realizing that with the gross hedonism which has as its goal the life of luxury, or with a utopian liberalism which has no respect for the duties and obligations, exaggerates rights, avoids responsibilities, and believes it can reform everything singing praise to liberty, the only thing which could be expected was ruin. One educator complains: "The teachers were deprived of their posts. The students' liberty had to be re- spected, discussion encouraged; one had to listen and peacefully put up with them, without ever being able to say the last word, even though the students should repeat nothing but nonsense after nonsense.... The students of today do not recognize the necessity of giving more value to their teacher's opinions than to their own, since the teachers also have deceived themselves. 'The teacher must not teach' has become the golden rule of democracy."43 The anecdote that is told about Fr. Martin D'Arcy in his visit to Japan is symptomatic. One day he asked a famous Japanese university professor what should, in his opinion, be the main point in the student's formation. The answer was: "The students have to be brought up on the spirit of absolute criticism." And when the English Jesuit asked what should be the criterion and basis of a sane criticism, the only answer was a: sokana? which 40 Tanaka Kotaro3 w t 4#k A1, Sbinri to beiwa wo motomete A, 31 e la $ -t (In Search of Truth and Peace), Tokyo 1950, pp. 30-43, 48-6I. 41 K6yama Iwao ;A 4 g, "Sengo Nihon no seishin j6ky6" a4 X * 0I Ah ,-O t (Spiritual Situation of Postwar Japan), S6bunsha (ed.), Gendai sbhikyj koza , vi, Tokyo 1955, pp. 99-142.

First they will stress their critical and autonomous attitude. Let us see the following testimony: "From then onwards my mother (Christian) began to tell me about religion. But 1, convinced as I am that it is idiotic Cbakarashii) to submit oneself to anything other than one's own judgment, would not give in. About that time, reading T. Miyamoto, I saw that he says that God is someone to be respected, but not someone we have to supplicate and so for that reason he did not depend at all on God. It was something I liked much .... But I cannot bear to have another force me into some new position. I mean to wait until I see for myself that religion is really necessary and necessary for me." Such a mentality is logically embodied in two attitudes: anthropocentric pragmatism and an anti-Christian attitude which condemns Christianity in the name of liberty, pro- gress, and tolerance. CA ANTHROPOCENTRIC LIBERALISM In the previous section we have noticed how young people react and show indignation toward the aberrations of popular religion; they instinctively repudiate the most ma- terialistic forms of religious pragmatism. But the purification was not able to break the limits of their anthropocentric vision of life, and consequently of religion. Fr. Spae, com- menting on the results of the questionnaire of the Committee for the Apostolate, has drawn our attention to the following phenomenon: "Our inquiry reveals that close to 6o0% Japanese consider religion to be exclusively an anthropocentric practice with only, if any, a vague and secondary relationship to a possible objectively existing superior being."45 In fact, to question 4 in section B: WVhat do you think of religion? 4I%0 have answered: a means for the harmonious development of man, and i5% say: for one's own peace and security. That is to say for 57.2% it is a means in man's life. It is interesting that in this as in many other points (65.4%) young people under 20 think in this way. In our discussion of the previous article we pointed out how, faced with tlle question Do you think that religion is necessary? those are clearly a minority who dare to say frankly: No, in spite of the desolate state of religion in Japan. If we ask what is religion goodfor, we can see the favorite answer among young people: it is good for man, or more concretely, to help him in the building up of his personality; it is good for his support, his security. 44 Cf.

Spae, "Japan Faces Christ," MB I2 (I958), 4I.</page><page sequence="13">3IO MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 The idea of support occurs with such insistency in the testimonies (such is the view at least of all (43 0) those who define religion directly or indirectly as an instinct born from man's impotency) that it certainly makes us suspect that we have discovered here a key element in the religious mentality ofJapanese youth. A brief look at the information given by Fr. Rene Picher, 0. P., from Sendai will be sufficient to confirm this. In fact, S8.3 0 of the answers to the question: hat doyou think aboutfaith?., have openly placed themselves in that direction (I7 out of the 28 university students, 6 out of the I4 senior high-school boys, and 5 out of the 6 senior high-school girls; I do not count those who have not answered question A, and 3 who have declared themselves Christians: a Catholic, a Protestant and an Orthodox). Most say: "When the human heart is disturbed and while unaided it cannot see clearly, then I think that faith has a meaning." "As for myself, I have no faith, nor do I feel the necessity for it at all. I do not object to others having it. I only feel a kind of compassion for them, because I think that one can live without that support." "In the moments of anguish and anxiety, when one does not know whom he can turn to, then I think that faith is necessary."46 There is only a step from the thought that religion is nothing but a support for the weak man to the declaration that it is nothing but an illusion. For instance, one student wrote: "I know nothing about the origin of religion, but the theories that it starts from the feeling of fear or man's weakness and his instinct to find a support for himself have always appealed to me greatly. In man, there is in fact an instinctive lonlging to search for something superior to himself, someone supernatural to whom one can go in time of happiness and above all of sorrow, someone on whomn one can de- pend implicitly. There is a necessity to thank someone in times of happiness, to seek in him consolation in times of sorrow and in moments of uncertitude. When one can- not find support in oneself, he looks for an object outside himself. Whether this object be the moon, Providence, or the Creator of the universe it does not make any difference. What is necessary is a superior being who can defend us. This feeling sets man's heart at rest. For that reason my idea of religion is a kurushii toki no kamidanomi (to go to God when sorrow visits us)." And another: "As man is weak, he thinks of some one who is stronger than himself and cannot but trust in his help. Thus, man believes, not because he is strong, but precisely because he is weak. Finally, there is in man a kind of instinct which impels him to understand what he is not capable of explaining. And thus he interprets as God everything which surpasses his own comprehension. Will this not be the origin of religion?" 46 Cf. Rene Picher, "Quand les jeunes regardent le Christ," Rythmes du Monde, 7 (I959), 320-3 32.</page><page sequence="14">NEBREDA: The Legacy of the TWest: 3II Or finally: "I believe that religion is necessary. But I allow its necessity only as an instru- ment to obtain salvation Qsukui). If there is a man who does not need religion, in my opinion, that man would be the greatest Qerai) in the world." In this context we can find a better explanation, for instance, of an anomaly which, surprisingly enough, is discernible in their very answers. Fr. J. Puisis' questionnaire: Do you think that religion is necessary?, was consoling: Yes No Don't know The chuigakok students (junior high-school) 74.8%0 20.2% 5.0% The kJtJgakko students (senior high) 64.8 1 i8.2 % I7.0% On the other hand, in the answers to the second question: Do you think that religion has any value for life later on? the balance of opinion is inverted: Yes No Don't know The chiigakkJ students (junior high-school) II.8 %0 85.800 2.4% The kotJgakkJ students (senior high) 2I.7% 64.3 0 2I.4 0 47 Does this not confirm, if it were necessary to confirm, that anthropocentric pragmatism characterizes the religious outlook of the young men in Japan? Religion is necessary for self-formation. But later in life, these boys think, it has nothing to offer, because they are supposed to be already formed.48 CB ANTI-CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE Christianity continues to be rejected in Japan as "the foreign" religion. However, in the context of the rationalistic liberalism in which we place ourselves now, it is paradoxically certain and closer to the heart of the matter to affirm with Fr. Roggendorf49 that the "strangeness" which the ordinary man in today's Japan resents in Christianity, is not the European outward appearance (it may well be that among the country folks there still exists some of the tabu feeling toward raso-Jesus's religion-regarding it as suspicious; but this is gradually disappearing). The resented "strangeness" has a non-European ele- ment in it. Its claim-completely opposite to the dynamically European aspect such as the Japanese liberals imagine it-of a revelation given in history. Its call to faith and complete self-surrender disquietes them. It is something impossible, it seems to them, to fit it into the framework of eclecticism, so traditional in Japan, strongly emphasized especially since the Tokugawa period, but that to the Japanese appears as the normal and characteristic 47 Cf. John C. Puisis, "Students on Religion," MB I4 (I960), 526. 48 That our surmise is not without foundation seems to be well shown by the following answer given by those who left religion, in the question- naire of Simoncelli: "Religion is necessary for the youth in order to know what is good and what is bad and to avoid an extreme utilitari- anism. But it is not necessary any more for the grown-ups." Cf. Carmelo Simoncelli, "Religious Beliefs in a Tokyo Workers' Neighborhood," MB, II (I957), 2IO. 49 Cf. J. Roggendorf, "Fiinfzig Jahre Jesuiten in Japan," Stimmen der Zeit, I63 (I958-59), 40</page><page sequence="15">3I2 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 European attitude. In the anti-Christian attitude of the modern man three elements can be distinguished. 1) Marxist Influence Its strategy handles various topics which repeat themselves ad nauseam and the end result is that the very air one breathes is charged with their slogans and catch phrases. Such are, for instance, that Christianity has been and is the defender of the ruling classes, that it is an enemy to progress, science, and liberty, and that it is hierarchical and there- fore feudalistic.50 2) "Humanistic" Influence "Humanism," let us say it at once, is used in its positively anti-Christian sense, since Christianity symbolizes for many Japanese absolutism, intolerance, authority and pro- hibition. A few examples will illustrate this. Prof. Shimizu writes: "We are at a cross-roads and only humanism will be capable of making Japan advance instead of retrograde by the strength of inherited conventions.''51 But he himself sees the very notion of humanism attacked by that insidious type of intellectuals - "religious people, in their majority"- who abandon "the true anthropocentric concept of humanism" for the theocentric idea of "the humanism of the incarnation." A proof of the always increasing influence of this interpretation is seen by him in the fact that "so many intellectuals should like to read Pascal." Allowing that the Catholic vision reveals a profound insight into human nature, he continues: "The notion of the human being in Catholic philosophy is that ofan impotent, limited, weak being." This vision will result in a pessimistic mood, he says, directly op- posed to the humanistic idea of the unlimited perfectibility of man. What will become of Japan if that idea prevails? Therefore, he concludes, much nearer to the original humanism of the Renaissance which courageously placed man in the centre of the world, is the prag- matism of America which can be the only source capable of making itself the vitalizing spring of the new Japan. As long as "moralists" maintain the "passive interpretation" of humanism, Japan will not be able to become great. On his part, Moroi Saburo qualifies Beethoven's music as antimedieval humanism. Beethoven liberated music because his humanism was that of an emancipated man. The b1it-mom that i h;c nt-n hI-c the t fltih- Q nf4th-l AfnrI 1rAAAI.

Scholasticism was inhuman, hostile to the values of this world and ignorant of the individual personality. With the rest of culture, music was also subjected to the Church. Whence it came about that only the human voice and not the instrumental music should have been honored by Catholics. Beethoven was the first to break radically from the remains of this spirit, and thus he is, in the domain of music, the great representative of the modern spirit of liberty for the emotions and sentiment.52 In this atmosphere, which is clearly that of modern Japan, it does not seem strange to us that 230 of the young people should have emphasized expressly tlis line of anthropo- centric autonomy and that io0 should speak of their repulsion toward religion, which they consider as an unacceptable halter for modern man; that io00 should mistrust Christianity, regarding it as an enemy to progress, and that another 60% should say of it that it is hard, authoritarian, unapproachable, or that finally i80% should stress in the face of religion the excellence of tolerance. One has expressed this: "To tell the truth I feel greater interest in Christianity than in Buddhism in spite of the fact that Christianity is foreign. And I do think that they are not a few of the Japanese of my age who think the same. Buddhism is to blame for this, because of its escapism from the world, with its sutras which nobody can understand. On the other hand when I see the prosperity of Christianity today I cannot contain my admiration. But I have some misgiving about it and it is the fear of allowing myself to be caught by a doctrine which is always saying: 'You ought to do,' 'You ought not to do. . .." Another clear manifestation of this "humanistic" attitude is that constant recurrence of the subject of the Index of prohibited books. Some seem to have no other problem or objection than this as their writings show: "A doubt which I have concerning religion is the problem of 'Literature and Re- ligion.' And for religion I understand Christianity. It appears that Catholics are forbidden to read Gide and Maupassant. Why? Gide or Maupassant as well as we, were sent to this world by God, and they, by means of efforts and constancy, superi- or to those ofother men managed to leave a name to posterity. Cannot we read with- out hesitation what they so painstakingly wrote? And cannot Catholics do the same?" Finally the commonest accusation that these "humanists" have logically to make against Christianity is its "irrational character." Let us see why: "The Christians say that Christ is not a mere man. I cannot absolutely admit such a stupid Cbaka3 pretension. Leavingjapanese Shintoism aside, those who have taught Buddhism, the Moslem religion, etc., declare themselves to be men. Why, then, is Christ alone not a man? For Christ as a man I feel great respect, but if he is the son 52 Cf. Ningen, Atr1 March I947: See also MB i (I947), nn. 5-6, p. 20.</page><page sequence="17">3I4 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 of God I do not feel any respect for him. My aversion to Christianity springs from this". 3) Scientistic Influence Notice how the elements of the three influences combine to deepen the aversion of the modern Japanese towards religion. Oka Kunio says: "Religion is nothing but a decoration made up by man to hide or rationalize class distinctions and mass oppression. Religion has been an aggressor against science; the Church has persecuted men of science because it did not want to lose its author- ity. Religion has not the value or the humility, which characterize science, of bending to the facts and the experience, ready to sacrifice dear theories. I do not look for the absolute God. I try to obtain the most beautiful life by means of reason rather than through religion."53 This seemingly religious veneration towards reason and science is something almost out of date in Europe, at least in that naive form. It is the atmosphere which prevailed in the European scene in the rosy years of the extreme posivitism, in which men such as Charles Nicolle and so many others were youths. The only contemporary exception, which comes to be a systematic confirmation of what we pointed out above where we spoke of the Marxist influence, is the case of the cultural orientation in the Iron Curtain countries. But these considerations have led us to the third section. 1I1 SCIENTISTIC POSITIVISM THIS is, decidedly, the most characteristic feature in the religious psychology of the students. In several of the contexts dealt with so far, the alert reader will have perceived it for himself. We can only quote a few examples: "The men of old seem ignorant in many ways when we examine them with our own eyes. That is why they could believe in vain illusions (kasJteki na mono), such as religion. But today, if one thinks scientifically, there is no difficulty in ceasing to support oneself on such groundless Ckonkyo no nai) things as these. For that reason in today's society it seems to me that religion has no meaning at all (mattaku muimi)." Another boy, after explaining the origin of religion as arising through ignorance, fear, insecurity, imagination (sJzo) that later on the process of evolution tried to sublimate into pure spirit, continues: "According to our text-book, God exists from all eternity and does not change. The book also says that God is the creator of the universe and of man; but looking at things from a scientific point of view, can it be possible to think that the spirit should have created matter? I cannot convince myself (nattoku dekinai) that a pure spirit should have created anything. In order that a spirit such as God should be 53 Cf. Shin 7oen ***g, March I947: See also MB I (I947), n. 4, pp. i5-i6.</page><page sequence="18">NEBREDA: The Legacy of the WVest: 3 I 5 able to exist, there must have been a brain. That is why it is not God who makes the universe and the world, but the other way round, the human brain has created the spirit of God. The teacher has told us that the religious mentality of Japan is the same as that which dominated Europe a generation ago. On hearing that I set my mind at rest. To be a fervent Christian is retrograde, I believe. That the Japanese who with much effort have freed themselves from the religious shell should revert to religion seems to me against progress. I doubt very much that religion is neces- sary any longer. But at any rate, if civilization continues to advance as it has done so far, it is certain that the strength of religion should break into pieces." Another wrote: "My father is a fervent Buddhist: even though he prays every day, I see nothing in bim but a common man like any other, with only a touch of magic and artificiality added as if he had lost the freshness of childhood. My sister, on the other hand, is a Christian ("holiness") and she makes a similar impression on me. My sister in fact, believes in all Christ's miracles, etc. But that is beyond my understanding. To tell the truth both my father and sister lack a scientific spirit. And in general, how rare it is to find a critical spirit among those who believe!" Obviously, "Scientific spirit" and "critical sense" mean here extreme positivism. Next, in ultra-positivist student says: "All the abstract, metaphysical ways of thinking are nothing but a useful substitu- tion for science where the latter cannot still be applied. But I hope that the day will come when it will not be necessary that science should make use of such substitutes." Or even more bluntly in the next one: "One of the insoluble enigmas of today which puzzles me most is to see how a great multitude of educated people should be capable of keeping their faith intact in the midst of the overwhelming scientific evidence which surrounds them everywhere. They, devout intellectuals, know all that the human intelligence has brought to light in the last century. They know that the earth on which they live in is only an infinitesimal particle of dust which senselessly floats in the infinite space of the universe. They know-Oh yes!- they know all that can be known. And yet, they believe in God, a fantastic being, who was born in men's hearts, thousands of years ago when men knew nothing, when they saw everywhere round them magic and mysterious power of something that they were not capable of understanding. But now it is altogether different. They know that religion is something fabulous and that if God exists, he can be nothing except the infinite void of space or the eternal process of time, which are the only two things that do not change in the universe -if we can call them things. But the more they know, the less their sound reason is of any use to them, because they think, they feel, that there is, that there must be something mysterious outside human comprehension. It would not be so strange among people without culture since they regard science as tricks and temptations</page><page sequence="19">MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx. i-A from the devil and would not listen to anything except to what they themselves believe in. How those educated people can behave in that way is beyond my under- standing. It is as if they had lost all that they had learned. I cannot cease asking my- self in astonishment how they will have been capable of reconciling those two dif- ferent phases, apparently incompatible, in their intelligence. I often think they must be satirists. Satirists at the cost of their own sincerity. But, then, it means that sati- rists always sacrifice their own honesty. Yet on the whole they usually are reserved and it seems as if they were laughing at their own perversity. While the effect which brings the satire of those who believe to its highest point, is that they like to show off their faith in public and they seem to be humbly proud of their sincerity." Although the formulation is here highly exaggerated, we cannot forget that, as a mentality, this scientism is something very common which, like osmosis, seems to be penetrating into all those who live in an atmosphere such as that of modern Japan. I shall never forget the look of anguish on the face of a Catholic boy, hardly I4, when he asked me, on the occasion of the excitement that Oparin's visit and diffusion of his works caused in the press and the intellectual world in Japan: "If it is demonstrated that a man can be made in the laboratory, will religion still be true? . . . " These are the signs of modern culture in Japan. We heard above, the expressions from one of the veteran exponents ofJapanese journalism, Hasegawa Nyozekan, all impregnated with faith and veneration for things rational and scientific. If Fr. Danielou could speak of the scientism as the first source of that kind of instinctive contraction which man experiences as soon as he hears people speak of "truth," this is even truer in the atmosphere such as Japan's, where the forces that should have maintained the minimum of equilibrium are reduced to an insignificant minority.54 Modern culture is channeled more and more into the route of positivism. Japan is far from being an exception in this point. John Blewett notices how in primary education in Japan the number of hours dedicated to the study of science is twice as much as in western countries: Western Germany, France, the United States, Russia and England.55 This fact appears in a report made by the Japanese Ministry of Education.56 The evidence is significant. Here is what was said by Matsumoto Masao speaking about the great Univer- sity of Keio in Tokyo, precisely the one founded by the champion of the rationalist liberal- ism, Fukuzawa Yukichi: "In this university, there is a tendency to refuse metaphysical and theoretical knowl- edge as useless and to take only the technical and practical as true and important."57 Nobody understanding their early training will say that they are illogical if they simply conclude from their positivistic formation, saying that religion can only be an illusion. 54 Cf. Jean Danielou, "Le scandale de la verite," ttudes, 304 (I960), 3-4. 55 John Blewett, "Whither Japanese Educa- tion," MB I4 (I960), I94. 56 Mombush6 (Ministry of Education) (ed.), Waga kuni no kyoikusuijun 4X cD 1fi k*4 (Edu- cational Level of Our Country), Tokyo, I959. 57 Matsumoto Masao - * if k, "The Impact of Catholicism on Oriental Culture," MB I4 (I960), 303.</page><page sequence="20">NEBREDA: The Legacy of the WVest: 3I7 CIV THE "ILLUSION" OF RELIGION IF IN the previous section we have seen that youth, even though repudiating pragmatism in its grossest and most materialistic forms, inevitably remain sonmehow within the field of an anthropocentrism no less pragmatic, it will be important now to state clearly that the scientistic atmosphere obliges men to make a more radical purification whose normal goal is the explicit denial of the objective value of religion. The reader will have by now realized that a great many of those affirmative answers to our question about the necessity of religion, about their experience of prayer, etc., will have to be carefully sifted before one is able to identify their valid contents. In the fact that 33 % of the young men should choose to see the explanation of religion a a pure illusion, apart from the overwhelming positivism of the environment, one ought to see, no doubt, an historical circumstance as the root cause. I refer to the increasing esteem of Marxist values which have in fact gained the first place in the overall vision of the Japa- nese intellectuals.58 We were able to perceive the theory of the religious illusion in almost all the testimonies above mentioned when talking about the positivism of science, and less explicitly perhaps, but no less effectively, in many of the examples that we have given in this and the previous article. However, as the subject is important, it is worthwhile to complete the list: "Religion is not something objective but the reason that man possesses. I understand religion in the following way: God is something which is only seen by the believer. He who does not believe cannot see. But if religion is a science, I think that it is un- scientific to study it after one believes. The true scientific approach is not to study once the eternal truth is understood but the other way round: while studying the things always from a critical point of view to arrive later on at the discovery of that eternal truth." In this manner, to the scientific positivism he adds a formula which has its logic and con- cludes with one of those lyrical leaps which occasionally amaze us in thejapanese mentality: "Thinking in this manner, will it not be certain that man has made God and religion rather than that God has created man?" And another: "God is something anthropomorphic. If I had to say it bluntly, I think, he is the 'illusory father' that man's imagination has created." Another, after having made a beautiful panegyric of Buddhism and Christianity, of Christ and Buddha, ends up by saying: "Even supposing that this world should have been made by God, since I have no 58 It is significant that Hidaka Rokur6 characterizes the Showa era as that of Com- munism, while for him the Meiji era is that of Protestantism and Taisho the era of Humanism: Cf.

MN: xx, 3-4 E</page><page sequence="21">3I8 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 evident reasons to see that such a God exists, I can say nothing, but if he exists, I should say that God exists ... in the heart of man." eCONCLUSION REPEATEDLY and in different countries in Europe when presenting ideas such as those we have discussed in this article, I have been asked how it is possible that in the very atomic era, the Japanese should continue to be stalled in a positivism which is comparable to the euphory of Comte's first years or the exultation and the naive optimism of a Renan in his Avenir de la Science. Europeans long ago abandoned such simplified concepts of reality. It is true that in Europe a series of sensational discoveries round the dawn of the 20th century (think only of Becquerel, Curie, Rontgen, Planck, Einstein, Rutherford) have shaken all the conceptions of materialism, mechanism, determinism, which were the dog- mas of positivism. But it should not be forgotten that if such a process of criticism and examination which ended up by bringing about the crisis of science as understood in the old sense, was possible in Europe, it was due, no less than to those revolutionary discoveries, to the powerful action of a spiritualist philosophy. Year after year that philosophy has in- creased its strength and volume: think, for instance, of Bergsonism and its impact on so many men of science. Unfortunately in modern Japan there has been no such spiritualist philosophy with power to form the cultural conscience. It is true that in Japan there have always been voices such as those of Tanaka Katara, the former ChiefJustice of the Supreme Court, and Yukawa Hideki, winner of the Nobel Price for physics, to name only some outstanding intellectual leaders. On the other hand, is it so true that in Europe, the positivistic mentality is already out of date? I stress this fact in conclusion, because the world becomes smaller every day and thousands of Japanese are always in search of a more exact or more profound knowledge of the culture and technique of the West. It is true that the great scientific men do not speak as their predecessors did in the past century, or even as they themselves spoke thirty or forty years ago. But the limited world of the so-called "Intellectuals" is far from believing that the old problems of science versus religion belong to past history. The Japanese who goes to the West to study or specialize is confronted with a positivist world. Later on, he will return to his country and will quiet his fellow contrymen by saying that there is no reason for change since the great men in Europe think the same as they do. A confirmation that on the other hand was hardly needed in Japan since men such as the two Huxleys, Bertrand Russell and so many other idols in modern science are well known to the Japanese public in translations spread in profusion, of their complete works. But if we want to get to the ultimate root of the Japanese mentality of today versus re- ligion, we have to ask ourselves why those who forged modern Japan, and, since then, their inheritors, have systematically taken the positivist and rationalist thinkers as if these were the only representatives of the European culture. The fundamental reason might be the long tradition of secularism during the Tokugawa period.</page></plain_text>
