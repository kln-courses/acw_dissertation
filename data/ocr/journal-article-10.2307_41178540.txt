<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF NO MAN'S LAND: A Response to Hartt and Gustafson Robert Cummings Neville I Tames Gustafson's Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective is a mas- ^terpiece of both brilliance and courage. Its brilliance consists in large part in its placing of ethics in the context of nature, its valorizing of the sciences of nature (including human nature, culture, and society) for their roles in the larger processes of moral discernment, and its insistence that God is the God of the whole of creation and is not to be represented in terms of the projections of the human scale and moral needs. Its cour- age consists in the fact that each of these points stands opposed to the major currents and pseudo-certainties of recent theol- ogy, moral theory, and the social generalization of the exper- tise of science. Why, then, does he undermine his whole project by excusing it from the need to take responsibility for its metaphysical presuppositions? More surprising, why does one of the nim- blest metaphysical minds of our time, Julian Hartt, acquiesce in this abnegation of responsibility even while twitting Gustafson on metaphysical points? My point of course is not personal: Gustafson's project requires a responsible metaphysics - he him- self has had other things to do, and they may have been far Robert Cummings Neville is Professor of Philosophy, Religion, and Theology and Dean of the School of Theology at Boston University.

Hartt's points, clothed in ironic humor, are indeed metaphysical in the main; but the irony blunts systematic efforts to sniff out the metaphysical presuppositions, formulate them articulately, and weigh them critically. In connection with Gustafson's project of relating scientific representations of nature to ethics, Hartt writes above, "turning again to metaphysics is not a wildly attractive option even though the Process theologians are still in the trenches when they are not out in No Man's Land." Having now expressed my humble criticism of both col- leagues for their failure to address direct responsibilities for metaphysics, I want now to show how metaphysics is indispen- sable for the ethics in which they and I are in such large agree- ment, and to offer some constructs. However underpopulated the No Man's Land of metaphysics, as Hartt calls it, it still has some important and illuminating ideas without which (or with- out suitable alternatives) ethics from a theocentric perspective cannot be seen to be possible, I believe. The Editor's invitation to me to participate in this discussion must come from the fact that I am a logorrhetic metaphysician who writes about ethics from a theocentric perspective. There are several preliminary matters necessary for setting the context. 1 . It must be admitted that metaphysics has not been popu- lar since 1950 among several of the groups with whom Gustaf- son has worked. Neither continental Heideggerians nor Anglo- American philosophers have generally taken "metaphysics" to be anything but a word of opprobrium. This is particularly true of analytic philosophers working on "action theory" or agency, and also of those concerned with ethical theory more narrowly construed. But there are counter examples, for instance Rob- ert Nozick's Philosophical Explanations (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981), Edward Pols' The Acts of Our Being (Am- herst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1982), John F. Post's The Faces of Existence (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), or David Weissman's Intuition and Ideality and Hypothesis and the Spi- ral of Reflection (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987 and 1989 respectively). Furthermore, there is a distin- guished list of philosophers not of those two traditions who have flourished in metaphysics in the last forty years, although the dominance of analytic and continental philosophies in aca-</page><page sequence="3">On the Architecture of No Man 's Land 703 demie politics has largely excluded them from prominence or cast them in the role of critics. The list includes but is not limited to George Allan, Brand Blanshard, Robert Brumbaugh, Justus Buchler, Cheng Chung-ying, John Findlay, David Hall, Errol Harris, Charles Hartshorne, David Kalupahana, Elizabeth Kraus, George Lucas, F.S.C. Northrop, Steve Odin, Joseph Owens, Stanley Rosen, Sandra Rosenthal, Charles Sherover, William Sullivan, Tu Wei-ming, Paul Weiss, and Bruce Wilshire. The academic field of theology itself during much of the last forty years has been dominated by Neo-orthodox thinkers who, like the philosophical positivists, have tended to read their met- aphysical opponents out of the guild rather than refute them. Nevertheless, the plainly metaphysical Personalist tradition flourished for part of that time and gave rise to the century's most powerful expression of theological ethics in its intellec- tual funding of the civil rights movement. Process theology in- creases the numbers of its adherents and the sophistication and range of its vision daily. And after all the battles in American academic theology about which German was right, it appears now that Tillich is wearing far better than Barth, principally be- cause both his cultural criticisms and Christian doctrines arose in the context of a self-conscious metaphysical position. It is not quite fair, then, to say that metaphysics in theology and ethics is No Man's Land. The fairer remark is that, if a Christian ethicist wants to be respected by the anti-metaphysi- cians, then admitting dependence on metaphysics can be an embarrassment. So much for a defense of metaphysics in theology by the ar- gument of authority: people who say metaphysics is impossible don't know what is actual. 2. Although both Hartt in the passage quoted above and Gustafson in I: 56-61 treat process philosophy as the main ap- proach to metaphysics in contemporary theology - and it surely is the most dominant - it is by no means the only option. I my- self am not a process theologian, as I argued in Creativity and God: A Challenge to Process Theology, although Whitehead's theory of causation has been a powerful influence. Hartt's location of process theology in No Man's Land or the trenches does point out the fact that that movement has en-</page><page sequence="4">704 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville trenched itself. Partly this was because of the hostility of other kinds of philosophy and theology; process theology founded its own journal, its own society, and some "safe" schools and de- partments. Also, Whitehead's metaphysics is extremely com- plex and involves thinking in new ways, with new language, and thus takes a long time to learn; instant dialogue with other po- sitions is not possible, any more than one can take up Thomas Aquinas on Tuesday to refute the Heideggerians on Thursday. If Process theology has become somewhat schoolish and in- grown for these reasons, that is perfectly understandable; surely no "school" has made a more vigorous effort to relate to other schools of thought or intellectual disciplines. Yet it is clear to me, for reasons that will come out below, that Process theology has little support to give for Gustafson's ethics from a theocentric perspective; for instance, it does not support the view that God is creator. 3. My own hand should be shown right away. I do have a metaphysical system, even though people have assured me for thirty years that this is impossible. The system is expressed in exhausting detail in God the Creator (Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1968), Reconstruction of Thinking and Recovery of the Measure (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1981 and 1989 respectively); it is applied to explicitly theological themes, and to what Gustafson nicely calls "piety," in God the Creator, Soldier, Sage, Saint (New York: Fordham University Press, 1978), The Tao and the Daimon, Behind the Masks of God and A Theology Primer (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982, 1991a and 1991b respectively); the metaphysics is di- rectly applied to ethics, especially theological ethics, in The Cos- mology of Freedom (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974) and The Puritan Smile (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987). Because the argument from esse to posse is extremely powerful, I have little patience with those who believe meta- physics is impossible; that belief must be limited by short- sighted assumptions. Of course, metaphysics can be badly done, and I await instruction on that issue with such whistling in the dark as this paragraph itself illustrates. In what follows I shall take up several issues, beginning with strategic ones, and show the relevance of metaphysics to ethics from a theocentric perspective.</page><page sequence="5">On the Architecture of No Man 's Land 705 II The practical, in contrast to purely theoretical, function of met- aphysics is to exhibit how the world described in a certain way is possible. Gustafson writes, for instance, in II: 293, and Hartt cites above: God is the ultimate power that brings all things into being; sustaining, ordering, and bearing down upon them; and creating the conditions for possibility of change and development in them. God is the determiner of the ultimate destiny of all things. Now this would seem to be impossible according to most mod- ern assumptions. According to modern science, "the world" is bounded by something like closure, in the mathematical sense. The series of even numbers, for instance, is finite in its way but has closure in the sense of excluding all odd numbers. In the modern scientific view, the world has closure in the sense that it includes anything measurable and excludes that which admits of no measure. Although we now have subtler senses of mea- sure than Galileo or Newton possessed, the point for the defini- tion of the "secular" is the same. The problem for theology is whether God is within the world, and thus measurable against finite things, or without the world's closure and thus irrelevant in any way that can be registered or measured. The finite di- vine Fellow Sufferer of James, Brightman, and Whitehead is clearly within the world's closure in this sense, where closure means measurability by means of the metaphysical system. The idealists' God of reason (Hegel) or will (Royce) is supposed to be the defining character of closure itself, and thus is also within the world considered at large. None of these concep- tions conceive God to be the creator, although they can con- ceive God to manipulate some order, or to be Order itself. The deists' God was clearly outside the world, but irrelevant to any- thing measurable within the world; as "explanation" came in the modern period to mean "explanation in terms of the world's principles," even the deist reference to the clockmaker's original creation became irrelevant. Gustafson's position rejects the Big Fixer theory, the Divine Super Principle theory, and the Magnificent Irrelevance theory. He needs met- aphysics to show that the modern assumptions are limited and that his theory of God as creator, governor, etc., is possible.</page><page sequence="6">706 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville To put the point another way, descriptions of things and characterizations of actions presuppose metaphysical models of what things are and what they do. The various metaphysical schemes mushed into our common sense allow us to model persons creating clocks and messes, and the world is something like a clock and something like a mess. But no current com- monsense metaphysics allows us to model God creating the world, because all current metaphysical theologies require an agent like a person, and agents fall among the things created. So, the heart of Gustafson's theology, which Hartt so neatly identifies as letting God be God, cannot be believed straight by most modern people. Either he doesn't mean what he says, or the creation talk is just a sop to keep the religious language going, or Gustafson is not as appreciative of science and its suppositions as he professes. Gustafson's metaphysical mod- esty notwithstanding, Hartt is exactly right that he must pre- suppose something like Spinoza's theory because Spinoza neatly surmounts the problem of the boundaries of closure. More of that later. Ill Metaphysics is the representation of the basic traits of exist- ence that are presupposed in representations of lesser abstrac- tion. It deals with ontological issues such as the nature of existence or being, why this world or any world is real; it deals also with broad cosmological issues such as the nature of causa- tion, relation, position, identity, space, time, motion, value, and "meaningfulness" in some large sense. Any descriptive repre- sentation of the world, scientific or otherwise, and any practical representation of the world as ready for response or interpreta- tion, assumes something about metaphysical topics such as these. But what is assumed in unexamined metaphysics might be inherently contradictory or incoherent, and hence impossi- ble, as I worried above about Gustafson's creation theology. More likely what is assumed is confused, mushed together with related but not quite congruent assumptions, and the like. What is most mischievous is the metaphysical assumption that something fairly obvious is itself impossible, as in deterministic metaphysics' assumptions about freedom and responsibility.</page><page sequence="7">On the Architecture of No Man's Land 707 Responsible metaphysics is the careful development of rep- resentations or concepts about the big issues that can be articu- lated with clarity, analyzed, and critically assessed. Metaphysics has a long history, and every system arises in various dialectical relations with antecedents; Hartt's discussion of Gustafson's re- lation to Spinoza is a case in point. Even neologistic systems such as Peirce's or Whitehead's are to be understood first through their attempts to restate the truths and avoid the er- rors of the alternative systems. Metaphysical views are called "systems" because in their search for precision and criticizability they are expressed in what their authors hope are well-formed formulas. That metaphysical representations have systematic logical form does not imply that they have to represent the world as having the form of a logical system. That an action or God is the logical subject of a metaphysical assertion does not imply that an action or God is a substance like a subject with predi- cates. The analogy between the form of logic and that of real- ity was criticized long before Bergson or Whitehead. In fact, Leibniz was probably the first as well as the last philosopher to propose the hypothesis that everything that can be a logical subject of an assertion is existentially like a logical subject with predicates. "God is not a thing" is perfectly intelligible within a metaphysics that accounts for alternatives to things, such as actions, creators, etc. A metaphysical representation, including a whole system, has the logical status of an hypothesis. As Whitehead noted, it has to be internally consistent and coherent as well as applicable to the world and adequate to represent everything in its abstract way. Metaphysics is neither deductive nor read off reality in a naively realistic way. Nor is metaphysics based on a certain or undeniable starting point. Rather, a metaphysical hypothesis is a representation whose framing attempts to articulate whatever is real and important. Just as Gustafson defines the process of moral discernment as a fallible endeavor to weave together considerations from many sciences, personal and common ex- periences, history, and good taste, so metaphysics is big-scale discernment. The chief virtue of a metaphysical system is not its entrenched defenses but its vulnerability, its susceptibility to correction.</page><page sequence="8">708 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville IV With respect to the claim that God is creator, I recommend the following hypothesis of metaphysical representations. Let the "world" consist of everything that is determinate or has identity. "Determinateness" is an extremely abstract general- ization of scientific claims about the "measure" that defines the closure of the world. Let God then be understood as the crea- tor of everything determinate. Because everything determinate is created, there is nothing out of which the world is created; hence, creation is ex nihilo. The noun substantives "God" and "creator" suggest creative agents. But that is a misleading analogy from the logical form of the assertion to what is asserted. Rather, the idea of creation ex nihilo requires analysis in three terms, each of which presup- poses the other but none of which can be reduced to the others. First, the creation is the source from which the reality of the world comes, the "ground of being," to use Tillich's term. By the logic of the creation of everything determinate, the world is wholly dependent for existence on the source, and the source can have no dependence, save one, on the world. The one exception in the latter case is that the source would not be source unless in fact it gives rise to the world; the determinate character of "being source" is a created by-product of the larger creation of the world. Second, the creation is the world as created, the world con- sidered in its ontological contingency or as manifesting the cre- ative power of being determinate rather than nothing at all. "What" the world is can be called its cosmological character; its ontological character is "that" it is. Because the world includes everything determinate, it includes the possible as well as the actual; it includes the impossibilities excluded by the actual and possible; it includes space and time as well as things with spa- tial and temporal position; it includes the values of things, and the ideals determining what values things ought to have and perhaps do not. If there are certain transcendental conditions of determinateness as such, as I shall argue there are, they to- gether constitute a kind of logos in which and by which all things that are made are made (a theologically useful metaphysical point).</page><page sequence="9">On the Architecture of No Man 's Land 709 Third, the creation is the act by which the world is created. Without the act, the source would not be the source of any- thing, nor would the world of determinations be real. Without the world, the act would not have created anything; without the source, the act would have no efficacy. The three terms - source, world, act - are logically symmetrical and interdefin- able. Yet the act is radically asymmetrical. The act is not a me- diator between two independent terms; nor is it a constituting thing that makes two dependent terms possible. Rather, it is the asymmetrical bringing into being of the world from the source which is nothing in itself. The act of creating cannot be construed on the model of a substance with properties, because all its properties are its results. That God is the source, the creative act, and the world-as-determinate-terminus of that act, is all itself part of the world as determinate result. On this met- aphysical hypothesis, God is God only as creator, and has a na- ture only as revealed in creation. In Spinoza's terms, the creative act is natura naturans, the created world of finite modes is natura naturata, and the source is badly represented by the idea of God as Substance. The representation is bad because Spinoza's definition of substance as that which can exist alone applies only within the realm of natura naturata. If God as Sub- stance is really non-finite minus the finite modes in natura naturata, then God can just as well be called Nothing as Sub- stance; aloneness and togetherness are inapplicable in either case. There are several advantages of the hypothesis of creation ex nihilo for Gustafson's theocentric ethics. For one thing, how one characterizes the creator beyond the bare source-determi- nate world-act terms depends on how one further characterizes the world. If the world has the kind of unity that one would ascribe to a unified agent, God can be called an agent, and we can easily speak of the creator rather than just the creation. If the world shows purpose, we can speak of a purposive agent; if deliberate purpose, then an intentional purposive agent. Gus- tafson wants all these issues to be empirical ones about how the world is. In a broader perspective of comparative religions, we can ask whether the world is such that the creator can also be understood in the metaphors of mind, as in India, or in those</page><page sequence="10">770 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville of principle, as in China. Comparative theology can explore what is at stake in these differences. From Gustafson's Reformed perspective, which I share in a Wesleyan manner, God as creator ex nihilo is absolute sovereign over the world, however ambiguous the agential character of that sovereignty is. There is nothing determinate that does not depend wholly on God. That divine transcendence, emphasiz- ing God as source, is also balanced with a perfect immanence: God is in every determinate thing as the act which brings it to be. Further, because there is no medium by which to detach determinate things from the creative act, each thing is a part of God as accomplished creator, determinately related to the other parts. As a Reformed theologian, Gustafson can say not only that our response to God should be piety but that our piety is God glorifying the creator in us. As creator of everything determinate, God is surely governor and sustainer of the world. Yet among the determinate things are free and responsible human beings, and we are created to be that way. Freedom should be analyzed in terms of the com- plex of factors that go into having a open future, having a past that provides potentials for differential responses, having dis- cernible values that give moral significance to choices, having natural and social options recognizable for their relevance to responsibility, and so forth. Because God is the creator of everything determinate, God cannot be a special coercive agent within our world; God cannot be the creator at a first moment who determines what will happen ever after; nor can God be merely the end product of the historical stream. Because tem- porality is among the things created, the act of creation itself is eternal, and holds within the togetherness of the three modes of time all our moments, each as future to be decided by us and other factors, each as present in the deciding and suffering, and each as past achievement determining moral identity. God the creator is not present, nor past, nor future, but all of these eter- nally; not at once or forever, but eternally. The identity of a creature as creature is not what has been achieved up to a cer- tain point, or what the creature is at that point minus the lapsed past and distant future, or what the creature will be at the end of its days. The identity is rather within the eternal life of God in which the three modes of temporality are all together, non-</page><page sequence="11">On the Architecture of No Man's Land 711 temporally together. That sense of eternity, which can be ren- dered only on a radical hypothesis of creation ex nihilo, is crucial for moral responsibility, and hence for Gustafson's theocentric ethics. V One of the subtlest parts of Gustafson's ethics is his careful delineation of the dependencies and independencies of human beings. In contrast to existentialists who emphasize radical freedom, he shows how we are dependent in various ways on natural and social conditions, indeed are merely continuations of them in some cases. But against the determinists he shows how we sometimes can have sufficient integrity to be free and responsible. The danger of the radical freedom view is that things are conceived to be autonomous and rather isolated; the opposite danger is that things are conceived to be nothing but their relations. What is the unifying middle ground according to which Gustafson can classify his phenomena on both sides? Let us suppose a further metaphysical hypothesis, that to be determinate is to be a harmony of two kinds of features, condi- tional and essential. The conditional features are those by which a thing is determinate in respect to something else, in respect of color, for instance, or in respect of not being in Alaska, or in respect of having no option but to do x. The con- ditional features of a thing are all its antecedent causes, the en- vironing conditions to which it has to conform, and the future possibilities limiting its actions, including those it might antici- pate imaginatively. The essential features, by contrast, are those that determine how the thing composes its conditional features. They determine how the thing takes up a space- time position within the limits of its past and its environment; they determine how the thing in its decisive present moments actu- alizes one pattern of conditions rather than another. The es- sential features relative to a thing's future determine the worth of its options, and hence what the thing's moral identity can be (this is not interesting except in the case of rational agents, I suppose). The essential features of a thing's past determine its accumulated character as well as its accumulated obligations. As a harmony of conditional and essential features, a thing is both necessarily related to other things in respect to which it is</page><page sequence="12">772 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville determinate, and essentially itself so as not to be reducible to its relations. Whether the conditions allow of much interesting essential choice is an empirical matter, as Gustafson rightly wants to say. Whether the essential choice is exercised with reference to relevant moral identifications of the options is also an empirical matter. With this metaphysical point, however, the necessity each time to take an empirical look rather than to presuppose a deterministic or indeterministic metaphysics is al- ways emphasized. The hypothesis that things are harmonies of conditional and essential features neatly expresses the bal- anced point Gustafson frequently makes, namely, that things are always related and connected, and yet are not exhausted in those connections. As Spinoza would be the first to say, one's solution to the problem of the One and the Many determines most of the rest of one's metaphysical consequences. VI Another central theme in Gustafson's work, frequently ex- pressed but given special emphasis in II: chap. 9, is that ethics deals with ordering things, with giving or changing form or pattern. In this connection, his point is often that the patterns with which we deal are far larger than the human sphere, that they extend on microscopic and macroscopic scales beyond our ken. Therefore, the anthropocentrism of much of our ethical tradition is a danger to the accuracy of appropriate scales of moral measure. Furthermore, because he interprets God prin- cipally as ordering things, a theocentric ethics is endangered by anthropocentric approaches to order that think too humanly. Gustafson's expression of the point is fine as far as it goes. But I suspect it masks a profounder point for which he is reach- ing. The issue is not merely that the patterns of order are vaster than we think. It is that the creation consists of compo- nents to be ordered that have careers of their own, and these careers carry the components temporarily into the human sphere to be ordered in humanly relevant ways, and then out again. To understand real things, we must look not only to the patterns in which they are formed but also to the components out of which they are formed. This is not exactly a form-matter distinction, because the components themselves are things with both pattern and subcomponents; those subcomponents have</page><page sequence="13">On the Architecture of No Man's Land 713 careers of their own, perhaps only temporarily resident in the original components, and so on. So, for instance, the prosper- ity of an economy can be understood in terms of its pattern of exchanges and other economic forms; but it also needs to be understood in terms of the climatic cycles of the place, the changing conditions of environmental and human migrations, the cycles of disease, of atmospheric changes, and of weather. These latter components shift by causes not of the human scale, and their own components are even farther removed. "Nature" thus can be conceived as the swirl of processes that adventitiously and temporarily coalesce in patterns that them- selves sustain human life and civilization. To point out that God is the God of "components" as well as "order" is to balance the religion of the Sky God with that of the Earth Mother. The family of symbols and rites associated with the Earth Mother points to the network of connections be- low the level of the morally significant, although functioning as conditions for the moral. The Earth Mother governs processes of fertility, of seasonal change, of the round of destruction and creation. Worship of God as Earth Mother is a bit amoral, but it is a deep piety that respects the goodness of creation in its processes that bear only tangentially on the human. Gustaf- son's piety includes respect for those curiously wonderful, often violent and destructive, forces of nature that, like the dif- ference between day and night, the lesser light and the greater light, God notes to be good. The point here is not to detract from the Sky God who imposes order, especially moral order, and whose concern is with the right pattern. The point rather is that God creates through both pattern and components, hence is both Sky God and Earth Mother. Both Hartt and Gustafson admit that there is some logical difficulty with the part-whole model for calling attention to the divine rather than human scale of moral concern. The problem of course is that we cannot define wholeness, and "more inclu- siveness" is not necessarily better; modern state-totalitarianism has shown us that. Gustafson's point is made better, I believe, by pointing out that the unity of component processes and morally significant patterns is neither more pattern, as a moral- ist might want, nor more processes, as a naturalist might want. The unity lies in the creative love of God that mixes compo-</page><page sequence="14">714 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville nents and pattern with an irony that relativizes morals and trig- gers blind awe at some of the components. Morality always takes the perspective that relates things as means and ends rel- ative to humanly perceived good. Aesthetics sees that each thing is a center of value for which everything else is the envi- roning and supportive world. Morality from the aesthetic standpoint is an arbitrary human cut. Aesthetics from the moral standpoint is the amoral pride of attempting to appre- hend things from the divine standpoint that is equally close to everything. Religion, which makes Gustafson's ethics theocen- tric, is the ironic perspective that holds in balance, without a supervening rule, the finite anthropocentrism of ethics with the infinite Mother's perspective of aesthetics. VII A conclusion to be drawn from Gustafson's themes lifted up in the last two sections is that human existence is intrinsically ambiguous. Even the wisest and best intentioned of us is caught between the morality that says some things are for the sake of other things and the divine aesthetics that says things have their own careers, their own excellences, and their own destiny apart from what they might serve or be served by. At best, this means that the flourishing of one person or group is often at the expense of the flourishing of another, not to speak of necessary natural transactions that are cosmic accidents for the human. Almost alone among contemporary theological ethicists, Gustafson clings to the normative sides of this ambi- guity in the face of moralistic and naturalistic reductions. Ought he not acknowledge then, at a metaphysical level, a problematic of coming to terms with one's actual ambiguous existence, and with the ground of being? This problematic ob- viously relates to that of the righteousness of order and of piety of components, but is reducible to neither. Although in "es- sence," as Tillich put it, everything ought to be compatible with the unified ideal, in "existence" there is no super-ideal that unifies the ideals for the multitude of finite existences, includ- ing those that need to be harmonized in the human community and in the human occupation of a natural environment. Gus- tafson rightly criticizes Tillich for orienting religion to the sal- vation of humans rather than the glory of God. But Tillich is</page><page sequence="15">On the Architecture of No Man's Land 715 right - Gustafson does not really disagree - about the ambigui- ties of finite existence to be overcome in the divine life. A metaphysical lesson is to be learned from this that would help keep the practical and piecemeal discussions straight. Nothing exists without pattern. Nothing exists without compo- nents, which are not just more form. Two basic conditions for existence thus appear, two transcendental : form and compo- nents. Now it is apparent that the actual mixture of form and components is not reducible to either one but is an equally ba- sic condition of existence. Although any actual thing has both pattern and a reach on components, its actuality is particular and unique to itself. There is thus a third basic condition for existence then, the ground of particular being or actuality. If God is creator as Sky God of order and Earth Mother of sub- liminal networks, God is also creator as ground of being. Noth- ing is new about this claim, of course, except the setting of grounding in parity alongside form and components. Gustaf- son's theory of creation requires at least as much. VIII There is one more crucial metaphysical condition for exist- ence, namely, that things achieve some value. Theologically, this is the affirmation that God's creation is good root and branch. Ethically, it is an expression of the principle that dis- putes about the real values of things presuppose that things have real values about which to dispute. On the one hand, a thing achieves a certain value in itself by virtue of the things it sustains within its own harmony and what that harmony adds to them. Most of our moral deliberation, Gustafson would agree, aims to maximize the consummatory qualities of things. Yet the ambiguities of this are that the price for consummatory qualities here is frustration there, and the Mother's underlying forces might topple all quibbles about whose ox gets gored. On the other hand, therefore, a large part of a thing's value is what it contributes to the whole, or at least to its neighbor- hood. Perhaps the most significant task of human life is finding one's part, one's destiny. What is the path that allows one to fulfill one's own excellences and contribute one's value to that of the whole? In human terms this is not so much a question of</page><page sequence="16">716 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville quantity of value but of the meaning of life. Indeed, translate "path" into the fancy language of "tao" and you see that, in addition to the righteousness of right order, and to the piety toward components whose order is irrelevant and to the singu- lar actuality of one's own created being, there is a categoreal obligation to be oriented to the fitting destiny of one's worth. This, of course, is what religion is all about, and Gustafson is careful never to let the religious quest be reduced to social needs for moral direction, to an aesthetics of piety, or to an existential courage to accept one's given actuality. My metaphysical hypothesis now has attempted to tease out threads of Gustafson's careful polemic with four basic and irre- ducible conditions for existence: order, components to be or- dered, actual particularity, and value in context. These conditions are indeed transcendental: there could be no thing without each and all of them, and without them there could be nothing made that is made. They jointly constitute a kind of logos in the sense John used it in the prologue to his gospel. To be sure, they are not independent existences: there is no such thing as pure form without something formed, or components without harmonies of which they are components, or actuality that is not the specific actuality of some pattern and compo- nents, or value without specific internal achievement and exter- nal relations. Rather, the categories jointly constitute the conditions for any determinate created things and are the cat- egoreal means of divine creation. Furthermore, God the creator appears in each of the condi- tions, as Sky God, Earth Mother, Ground of Being, and Savior and Goal of one's life. A phenomenology of religion could be organized around the families of phenomena that associate with each of those epiphanies or expression of the divine es- sence (note the logos Christology lurking in the background). Theocentric ethics need not be separated far from systematic theology. IX I make bold, finally, to suggest a step Gustafson has not taken, although his Reformed theology beckons him toward it. May we not develop the metaphor of covenant to say that human beings are created in covenant with the rest of creation</page><page sequence="17">On the Architecture of No Man's Land 717 and with God? This means, with respect to our relations with the rest of creation, that regarding order we should be right- eous, regarding components we should be naturally pious, re- garding actuality we should have courage and faith to embrace particularity, and regarding the path to decent value we should have hope. These four "virtues" are interlocked, oriented as each is to a necessary condition for existence as such. Yet they cannot be reduced to each other, and there is no overarching determinate unity of them. If there were, some one religion would have found it. As things are, each religion strives to press its basic symbols to cover the whole, and to cover up the lacunae. Underneath, each religion says that the integrating truth is compassion or love, a love a "little oblivious as to morals" in Whitehead's phrase, a love quickly exhausted by athletic universal piety, a love that supports but quickly tires of heroic struggles of existential faith, and a love that fulfills the inevitable fragmentariness of one's path. Part of the human covenant is to love the world, other people, their institutions, their natural environment, and ourselves, so as to maximize righteousness, piety, faith, and hope. The other part of the covenant is that we do all this because we are created with these obligations by God and, when we fail them, we are recreated in the divine love again and again. A theocentric perspective on ethics begins, as Gustafson says clearly, with God who creates, condemns, and recreates. God creates the world with an ontological act whose form of love holds in balance the enabling conditions of existence: form, components, actuality, and value. Without love, these would not be held together, and determinate being would be impossi- ble (forgive the metaphors mixing abstraction and pietism). How can we image this fundamental character of God as crea- tor? Only by loving in this finite way: through righteousness, piety, faith, and hope. Loving God and neighbor are very closely tied, as a distinguished first-century jurist once remarked. A covenantal theology based on the ontological conditions of the logos has great promise for firming up the balance and limi- tations of ethics in Gustafson's view, for acknowledging worth not reducible to human ethical concerns, for giving the prob- lem of coming to spiritual life in faith a proper place, and for</page><page sequence="18">718 SOUNDINGS Robert Cummings Neville acknowledging the concerns of religion. It would provide an orientation and frame for the insights he has defended so clearly piecemeal. Yet it is obvious why he has not moved as directly as this into the metaphors of Christian theology for his ethics from a theo- centric perspective. Those with whom he speaks are rarely Christians. In this age of the privatization of religion, the meta- phors of any religion are anathema if that religion is dominant in a culture. Indeed, because the practical ethical problems to which Gustafson has directed his inquiries have always been framed in a public secular way, appeals to religious metaphors are unintelligible and a waste of time. This is extremely frus- trating for an ethics from a theocentric perspective, as Gustaf- son must know better than the rest of us. In the end, however, Gustafson's careful and nuanced theo- logical ethics remains in search of a vision. Although one would not want to short-circuit the many different languages from science and society that present ethical problems, one must bring them into communication with a wisdom that can sort and assess. Although one should not expect to find a rule for making all conflicting concerns commensurate, as I have ar- gued here, still we need a vision of how and why concerns come into conflict. Most of all, we need a public language of ethics that allows for a nuanced discourse of deliberation. The public languages of our time, both those of the social contract and those of Marxist theory, are clearly inadequate for the issues Gustafson elevates for attention. Perhaps it is time to depriva- tize the metaphors of religion and offer them as the stuff of public moral discourse. Gustafson's ethics from a theocentric perspective presents more than enough reasons why this is plausible. A metaphysical reformulation of the suppositions of the theocentric insights is a crucial step.</page><page sequence="19">THOUGHTS PROMPTED BY NEVILLE'S COMMENTARY Julian N. Hartt 1 . Strictly personal. Look who is talking about somebody having a nimble metaphysical mind! Brother Neville (Method- ist to Methodist), your charity is deeply appreciated. I wish, though, you had remembered that I dwell in Rortyland. I have decided to get an unlisted telephone number. Do you want it, for the day you are tempted to repeat the indiscretion? 2. Gustafson has not asked me to sign on as public defender. He is eminently capable of managing his own case. (See "Re- sponse" and "Afterword" in James M Gustaf son's Theocentric Eth- ics, edited by Beckley &amp; Swezey, 1988.) Since there is no point in carrying water to Newcastle on both shoulders, so now I say it was no part of my program to contend that Gustafson's posi- tion would have been more coherent, more persuasive, more cogent philosophically, more Reform-like, etc., if only he had sunk his piers (peers?) deeper into metaphysical strata, or if he had topped it off with a shining metaphysical-theological dome. It is possible that if Gustafson had performed either or both of these feats of engineering the resultant system would have passed Neville's muster. But I didn't pursue that possibility. So I think any recommendation that Gustafson would do well to ponder that possibility is pretty hard to make out in my pa- per. I made out it would surely seem lukewarm - or even (pace Neville) ironical ' 3. I did not try to play a hand in the game of determining what the modern scientific view allows in the line of truth- claiming theological statements. Neville believes that mentality is a veritable paradise for trigger-happy quantifiers, all with a short-gaited notion of causality and no space at all for transcen- dence. If Neville is right, then Gustafson ought to approach that country in fear and trembling lest he be nabbed as a reli- Soundings 73.4 (Winter 1990).

There is little reason to believe that all the things scientists say about Nature are rationally de- rivable from particularities of scientific discovery and conjec- ture. Are those the evidentiary case for, say, Einstein's necessitarian Nature? Or does Fred play strictly according to Hoyle in his view of Nature? Gustafson and Neville largely agree that framing a scientific worldview is a philosophical rather than a scientific enterprise. Hence, the modern scientific view assuredly is not a summary of scientific "truths." Rather, it is a range of conceptual generalization and poetic imagina- tion in principle beyond the verificational techniques of science in its empirical protocols. There are two cardinal principles of modern scientific thought - whether empirical or worldviewing - in which Gus- tafson has a considerable interest. These are (a) Continuity and (b) Causality. (a) Continuity. Does Gustafson's use of this grand principle embrace a picture of Nature as a totally gradient affair? If so, what are the proper theological-anthropological inferences of this picture? For instance, is human being kin to every order of beings below and every order of beings above (if any, yet), all the way to the top, all the way to the bottom? Top? Bottom? Have we inadvertently, perhaps injudiciously, stumbled upon Ground of Being and Creator? Not if we give Spinoza the nod. For him God is in all cosmic and historical events and entities. That is his nature. But what about Gustafson? Does he believe that God is the master of the Continuum (Nature), tran- scending it in some real and important way? Or is "God" but a name, of religious provenance, to be sure, for the Continuum? Well, what does Gustafson want with/from Continuity? (1) How about methodological symmetries linking scientific and theological-ethical ventures? Thus: all cognitional stipulations as such must answer to the tests of experience. Very well. - But do the tests of experience themselves form a seamless gradient whole, an ascending-descending series of stipulations each of which presupposes and entails all the others? Here the interrogatory is out of hand. Gustafson has made it clear that experience, the court of first and last resort, is not so neat, not so damnably Hegel-like. Criteriologoical stipulations</page><page sequence="21">Thoughts Prompted by Neville's Commentary 721 do not need to be systematic (or do we mean systemic?) to be intelligible and fertile. Surely the sciences are living proof of that. (2) Perhaps structural analogies provide another aspect of Continuity important for Gustafson's program. Aristotle does a large business with Form/Matter and Act/Potency. Spinoza rings in with Substance/Attribute and Infinite/Finite Modes. Neither Aristotle nor Spinoza indulges in Possibility except in the pallid sense of posse, the future state of an entity, that, seen sub specie aeternitatis, is as much a part of its definition ("es- sence") as its past and present states. It occurs to me that Gus- tafson needs a richer notion of Possibility. And this, I think, for Gustafson is deeply involved with (b) Causality. To this, ac- cordingly, I now turn, not entirely sure that Neville has opened the route to (metaphysical) salvation. It is a commonplace that physicalist worldviews have an un- mistakable monistic bias: Vis a tergo, the physical conditions of an event constitute a necessary and sufficient causal explana- tion of its occurrence. So far as human being lives wholly in a nexus of physical-physiological forces, it is a product of those forces. Whether it is even remotely plausible so to situate human being is another question. I do not here advance an opinion on it, judging it to be more important to see where Gustafson comes out. He surely does not settle for that univocally 'physicalist' doc- trine of causality. Intentionality may or may not be uniquely human, but it is indefeasibly real as a causal factor in human activity. Perhaps this is part of the attraction Process philoso- phy holds for Gustafson, namely the conviction that Lure is at least as important as Force. If so, it is possible that continuity here moves into a state of crisis. Are there Primates other than homo sapiens that act intentionally - act, that is, with a view to actualizing a purpose, attaining a goal, completing a project (such as writing a theocen trie-ethical treatise)? Arguments over the chimps' powers of speech seem interminable and in- decisive. (Perhaps the chimps will have the last word?) Be that as it may, I am very far from contending that Gustafson is under metaphysical pressure to flirt with reductionist Natural- ism. He would agree, I am confident, that the physicalists have a neater view. It seems so surgically nice to account for think-</page><page sequence="22">722 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt ing itself, including this little gasp of it, as a by-product of grit- tier stuff. I don't know how widely or sincerely epiphenomenalists advertise that "by-product" is a metaphor. We can all sense the metaphorical excess in Cabinis' claim that the brain "secretes" thought. His metaphorical liver secreted philosophical bile, a product better known in our own Enlight- enment as Nonsense. Neville finds that Gustafson can't have his theocentrism with- out establishing metaphysical foundations for God. Taken one way this might mean that Gustafson's categoreal "arms are too short for him to box with God." Taken another way it means that there are ontological facts Gustafson has not adequately accounted for. If so, I suggest that intentionality is one of these, perhaps the crown prince of the lot. If in turn this is the case, then the effort to spot an important weakness in Gustaf- son's position would require us to track intentionality into the heart of his anthropology rather than Creativity into his doc- trine of God. Here I do not post myself as the leader, or even as the sponsor, of that expedition. I have in mind a humbler self-appointment. 4. It doesn't matter a great deal whether we can or cannot reasonably ascribe intentionality to orders of beings with which we share inescapably earth and the circumambient heavens. What really matters is whether this ontological principle is causa sui (so to speak) in humankind. If it is, we must then ask what, if anything, this tells us, or rightly inspires us to believe, about Nature as the scheme embracing all things finite, that in and by which they are deployed in patterns upon patterns of interrelationships; quite, indeed, as Gustafson so cogently affirms. (a) Here Spinoza is illuminating but otherwise not very help- ful. In his view the driving internal principle in every being, the nisus, seems to be goal-oriented: every being seeks to preserve itself and, indeed, to improve its situation, to enlarge itself. (This is a beautiful case of metaphysical bootlegging, this drive for "improvement"). As noted, this surely allows for posse, even for potestas. But (as noted) only as the future state of a given entity. That state is as determinate as the present state of the entity. Hence, posse is not a clue to a realm of possibles from or out of which some beings can arrange a future in mentis (once I</page><page sequence="23">Thoughts Prompted by Neville's Commentary 723 had in mind the idea of becoming a metaphysician; then a psy- chiatrist; then I met one of the latter), and subsequently decide to actualize it. If Spinoza is right, no finite mode really works that way. So it is not the way we ever work, either. (b) But Spinoza is wrong. I am not entirely sure that Gustaf- son believes Spinoza is wrong. My haziness on this point floats around Contingency, a very important concept for Gustafson. As I read him, he certainly wants it to mean dependency. Ontological bed-rock: nothing can be itself save in relation to other beings, and so on for them, ad infinitum. But now what about contingency as indeterminacy? Another chunk of onto- logical bed-rock: For at least one class of beings, persons, some of their future states (=what they are voluntarily to be- come) must be envisioned and finally woven of diverse ele- ments. So, talking about persons creating themselves is surely sensible, up to a point. But is it possible to determine the pro- portions, in that weaving of diverse elements, uniting the given and the created in the acts of 'self-creation'? The question an- swers itself, if it needs to be asked. It is clear enough that Gustafson counts on this second sense of contingency as well as the first. Perhaps he is willing to as- sign it a cosmological magnitude, thus taking it well beyond personal and interpersonal modalities. If so, then it is legiti- mate to think of Nature itself as being made up from moment to moment, its ordering always containing novel features. So represented, Nature does not follow rigid foreordained rails from one phase to the next in its history. It does not follow from this, though it might be true, that Nature's laws are 're- gional' (Whitehead), and are subject to modulations in se, not just in human formulations. It may well be that Gustafson does not want to commit his vehicle to this sort of cosmological extravaganza. Perhaps the anthropic epistemological presupposition imputed to quantum mechanics theorizing may give him an advanced case of philo- sophical fidgets. If so, he does not suffer alone. Even so, such stuff may well give us pause before (or after) embracing pas- sionately the chilly chaste anti-anthropomorphism of Spinoza and his myriad philosophical offspring, not all of whom know who their pappy was.</page><page sequence="24">724 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt (c) Are the metaphysical transcendental of Aristotle and Aquinas and Neville (keeping strictly to the big-time here) cer- tifiably free of antropomorphic taint? I can nibble at the issue, thus: The transcendental are abstractions from/of experi- ence. Nolo contendere, fellows? Good for you. On to the next motion. Whose experience? By stipulation, common experi- ence. The force of that is not ostensibly the same as "every- body's experience", but it had better be in the neighborhood. The caveat shrivels down to hardly more than the observation that some people claim to have stunningly uncommon exper- iences, quite beyond the indelicacy and short reach of everyday language to negotiate. Which means that uncommon subjects have come upon uncommon objects; or these subjects have been uniquely affected by experients (objects) showing up pretty much all over the place. What licenses experience-transcending employment of the Categories? Either aesthetic-rational factors; or pressure, solic- itations, revelations, what-not, from Beyond. So back to inten- tionality. We cannot make sense of human existence without this principle. It may be purely accidental, seen sub specie aeternitatis (though when Spinoza puts on these spectacles he never sees any accidents), that human beings must think teleo- logically about experiences, if only in the vulgar sense that we have to make plans, pursue them in the hope of getting some- where we consider good, etc. Granted, this nature-enforced habit gets out of hand, spawns such weird questions as Why is there anything at all? That sort of thing inspires stern meas- ures to beat teleology back into its pen, admonishing it to re- strict its pesky Why interests to How issues, such as How is it that some men beat their wives? Here the intent is hardly to uncover their methods but, rather, their motives, ah, yes, the motives, the real causes of such beastly behavior. But the next thing we know here comes Purpose again in the simple-minded form of, What in the world did you have in mind in acting that way? Why did you beat her rather than a piece of furniture, or Fido? Oh, you say she deserved it? Or did you say, It's the sort of thing I enjoy doing on Saturday nights?

And these, I greatly fear, or meanly suspect, have an unmistakable religio-metaphysical resonance. They are inherently susceptible of categoreal inflation. Sufficient reason for Nietzsche's drive to get beyond them. He knew the difference between a reason and a cause. I honor Gustafson's desire to apply the brakes somewhere along the line. Thus: Powers beyond our control, and argua- bly beyond our comprehension are in the goods-making busi- ness. But we do not know, and we profit but little from speculating, whether such powers subscribe to the Good per se, whatever that is other than a Big Word. All right. But do we have adequate grounds for believing that the goods-making powers working in/as Nature acknowledge, each to itself and each to its fellows, that they are all in the same business, and that unity is one of the over-riding goods they are after? 5. Should Gustafson make only tentative theological ges- tures towards an absolute montheism, and rest more comforta- bly with pluriform divinities each honoring (illustrating, more plausibly) a cosmic drift, perhaps even a commitment (an- thropic language, God wot), to maximizing unity, but asymptotically? I suggest that the God of Gustafson's theocentrism is a rela- tive of H. Richard Niebuhr's Absolute: Deity construed as the ultimate rationale of Perspectivism. Perspectives, it seems, necessarily stipulate something of which they are just what they are, namely perspectives, each finite but each trained upon, ori- ented to and by the Absolute. This is something like an inter- nal critique (Hegel-like) of Relativism. It is also something like a refined common-sense: Surely Relations hitch on to some- thing that isn't itself a relation, that is, Bang doing the relating, and only but truly in that sense being its activity. But that, surely, is not the same as being its effects. Does such an Absolute, such a Deity, know what it is up to, where it goes from here, does it appreciate its own moves etc.? Let Calvin have here the last word, problematically. If God does everything (O no, Spinoza, not that he is all things!) for his own glory, does he really enjoy it, thus making it all good?</page></plain_text>
