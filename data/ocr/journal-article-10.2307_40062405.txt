<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANTE'S ULYSSES AND AHAB'S VOYAGE: THE ANGELIC IMAGINATION IN THE LITERAL WORLD Thomas Werge In Moby-Dick, argues D. H. Lawrence, the apparent polarity between the literal and ideal dimensions of the soul, experience, and reality coalesces: " It is all strangely fantastic, phantasmagoric. The voyage of the soul. Yet curiously a real whaling voyage, too. We pass on into the midst of the sea with this strange ship and its incredible crew. The Argonauts were mild lambs in comparison. And Ulysses . . . defeatfedj the Circes . . . of the isles. But the Pequod's crew is a collection of maniacs hunting down a lonely, harmless white whale."1 The real and literal voyage of the Pe- quody a ship which embodies a soul whose movement is an itinerarium mentis, is as significant in its definiteness and actuality as are the stranger and more dramatically metaphysical aspects of the voyage. Further, the Augustinian and Dantean interpretation of Ulysses* voyage- in which Ulysses leads his crew to shipwreck and destruction by seeking to know and conquer all the phenomena of experience while repudiating the literal world, finiteness, and any guide except his autonomous self- reinforces, through its relevance to Ahab's voyage, the central place of the literal world in Melville's thought and imagination. These considerations may help to define the conflict in Moby-Dick between a kind of atomistic "Protestant Gnosticism," Cartesian and Calvinist in origin, which extends through post-Kantian idealism and Feuerbach's conception of religious ex- perience as an entirely subjective state of consciousness, and an apprehen- sion of the world as an incarnational and sacramental reality in which sacral, figural, and mediating images provide a ritualistic means for im- itating a divine order of being. Melville's understanding of the tensions be- tween what Allen Tate and William F. Lynch call the "angelic imagina- tion" affects his dramatization of man's place in the great chain of being; his conception of images and the analogia entis; his attempt to envision</page><page sequence="2">142 W E R G E Journal God as a principle of limitation and intercession rather than a wholly transcendent source of infinite plentitude; and his struggle to believe that the natural and human orders - even the "universal cannibalism*' of the oceans - are part of a divine creation and moral order which encompass, rather than exclude, love and forgiveness. I In the Odyssey, Ulysses is an apotheosis of skill, intelligence, cunning, and resourcefulness. Although his flawed humanity appears, the honed and acute quality of his natural intellect, despite the human and inhuman forces afflicting it, perseveres. According to one tradition in medieval com- mentary and mythography, Ulysses is a figura of Christ and his voyage a spiritual allegory - literal, tropological, and anagogical. Honorius is representative: Ulysses is called Wise. Unharmed he steers his course by the island, because the truly wise Christian swims over the sea of this world, in the ship of the Church. By the fear of God he binds himself to the mast of the ship, that is, to the cross of Christ; with wax ... the incarnation of Christ, he seals the ears of his comrades, that they may turn their hearts from lusts and vices and yearn only for heavenly things .... Unharmed the voyagers avoid the peril, inasmuch as through victory they reach the joys of the saints.2 A second tradition of commentary on the allegory of Ulysses, however, is far less affirmative. St. Augustine views Ulysses as a Christ manque', a solipsistic voyager who seeks to usurp God's place through the autonomous power of a deified self. Ulysses, lashed to the mast, is a grim parody of Christ stretched out on the Cross - a figura of aspiring but frustrated vainglory rather than of salvific love, obedience, and humility.3 In this light- as a voyager not in bono but in malo- Ulysses is the proto- type of those explorers who, according to St. Paul, have cast aside "faith, and a good conscience" and "concerning faith have made shipwreck" (AV, 1 Tim. 1:19). Dante dramatizes Ulysses and his voyage in light of this second tradi- tion. As Beatrice asks Dante in Paradise to gaze at the earth below them, "I beheld," he says, "the unwise passage of Laertes* son."4 Cary's transla- tion of these lines is less stark than the more literally exact rendering - the "mad track" (varco folle) of Ulysses - but Dante's anagogical judgment on the voyage is as clear as the self-exalting language of Ulysses' speech in Inferno XXVI and Dante's depiction of his ultimately self-destructive end.</page><page sequence="3">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 143 Ulysses speaks as a tongue of fire, and recounts how neither '"fondness for my son, nor reverence/Of my old father, nor return of love, /That should have crown'd Penelope with joy, /Could overcome in me the zeal I had/To explore the world, and search the ways of life,/Man's evil and his virtue.'" With '"but one bark, and the small faithful band/That yet cleaved to me,'" Ulysses sails through the straits of Gibraltar - '"where Hercules ordain'd/The boundaries not to be overstepp'd by man'"- to the '"unpeopled world.'"5 Through the persuasive energy of his exhortation, he makes his crew an instrument of his will: '"Call to mind from whence ye sprang. Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes, But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.' With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage The mind of my associates, that I then Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left." As they continue on "the deep way," far off '"Appeared a mountain dim, loftiest methought/Of all I e'er beheld. Joy seized us straight'"; "But soon to mourning changed. From the new land A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl'd her round With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed: And over us the booming billow closed." Ulysses' character constitutes his fate, and Mount Purgatory and ship- wreck define the inevitable destination of his autonomous "flight." The winged oars of the crew "gain" death and judgment. Melville's dramatization of Ahab's "angelic imagination" echoes Dante as strikingly as Ahab's voyage echoes that of Dante's Ulysses. Like Ulysses, Ahab often speaks from the fire of "fatal pride" and damnation: '"Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!'" (Ch. 119).6 The Satanic energy and "red hell" of the "rushing Pequod-its harpooners, like Dantean devils, gesticulating with "their huge pronged forks and dip- pers" - personify Ahab's mind and will: "laden with fire, and burning with a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, [it] seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul" (Ch. 96). Through the power of his speech and presence, he "welded [the crew] into</page><page sequence="4">144 W E R G E Journal oneness" in order to direct it "to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to" (Ch. 134). His "soul's ship" on the last day, the billows, the flying oars, and the concentric circles of the whirlpool which carries the "smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight" (Ch. 135) call to memory Ulysses* doom. And throughout the narrative, Ahab, like Ulysses, refuses to "swerve" from his mission- "the path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run" (Ch. 37) - for any limited, visible, and earthly object of love: his "widowed" wife and child, the captain's son, lost at sea, and every finite good. In denying them in the name of his relentless and obsessive vision, Ahab becomes, with Dante's Ulysses, an exemplar of the angelic imagination, which, as a movement of spirit, tries to disintegrate or to circumvent the image in the illusory pursuit of essence. When human beings undertake this ambitious program, divine love becomes so rarefied that it loses its human paradigm, and is dissolved in the worship of intellectual power, the surrogate of divinity that worships itself. It professes to know nature as essence at the same time that it has become alienated from nature in the rejection of its material forms.7 Ahab's rejection of material forms in his pursuit of essence presupposes, of course, that all visible objects are "but as pasteboard masks" and that man, as "prisoner," must strike behind all phenomena in order to know and destroy the ultimate truth: "'Sometimes I think there's naught beyond [the white whale]. But 'tis enough. . . .That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him'" (Ch. 36). Ahab's ontological assump- tions - as distinct from the hatred inherent in his will - have Platonic, and especially Gnostic, roots.8 The evil of matter has not been redeemed or sanctified by the divinity of spirit. As Melville understood it, this dualism, and other forms of it, was intensified by Occam's nominalism, the Carte- sian dichotomy between mind and matter, thought and a thoroughly deter- mined universe, and Kant's distinction between the appearances of objects and their essence. Neither for Locke nor for Kant are objects "illusions." They are always, says Kant, "regarded as something actually given."9 Yet because one's senses so profoundly affect the appearances one perceives, those appearances cannot be treated as "self-subsistent beings, existing outside us"; representations may exist, but the objects corresponding to them may not. Transcendental idealism, then, and not transcendental realism, is the more verifiable and consistent system: "these external things, namely matter, are in all their configurations and alterations</page><page sequence="5">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 145 nothing but mere appearances, that is, representations in us, of the reality of which we are immediately conscious."10 Despite Kant's attempt to preserve the non-illusory nature of reality even while insisting that the Ding-an-sich cannot be known with certainty, the respective discrepancies between material form and essence, noumena and phenomena, "real" and apparent, physical world and mind, became in- creasingly accentuated in post-Kantian thought. Feuerbach's subjectivism, for example, denied any ontological status to God, reality, or history. Only human consciousness exists, and "divinity" is nothing more than a projec- tion of that consciousness.11 Yet the dissolution of the supernatural world as an objective reality entailed the loss of the certainties of the visible world as well. No one knew more acutely than Nietzsche that the disintegration of belief in the supernatural world would exacerbate the contingency, ambiguity, and even unreality of the natural world. "The true [suprasen- sory] world - we have abolished," he writes in The Twilight of the Idols. "What has remained? The apparent one perhaps? But no! With the true world we have also abolished the apparent one."12 Further, the episte- mological and ontological relationships between God and the world tradi- tionally defined by the doctrine of the Incarnation inevitably became more problematic. Simone Weil remarks the absence of the Incarnation in the Cartesian system: "The view that Decartes had of God was of a God who is completely transcendent [as was Plato's Good], whom one does not meet in the world, which is pure matter. (Descartes insisted much more on the opposition between God and the world, as he did on that between mind and body, than he did on their union.)"13 For Melville, this abyss between God and the created and visible world was intensified by his understanding of Reformation thought, with its em- phasis on the absolute polarities of the "two kingdoms": nature and grace, law and Gospel, terrestrial and celestial being, ordinary experience and the mysterium tremendum, a God so transcendent as to be "wholly Other" and a world so fallen and corrupt that only a Jansenist perspective could apprehend it. In addition, the God of Luther, Calvin, the Puritans, and Pascal seemed hidden and unknowable. For Puritan theology, states Perry Miller, the character of God is "an utter blank to human comprehension. ... It is of the essence of this theology that God, the force, the power, the life of the universe, remains to men hidden, unknowable, unpredictable. He is the ultimate secret, the awful mystery."14 The corruption of nature and the mystery of the Deus absconditus, writes the Jansenist Pascal, are the persistent facts of revelation and experience: "so soon as the Christian religion reveals the principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen from</page><page sequence="6">146 W E R G E Journal God, that opens my eyes to see everywhere the mark of this truth: for nature is such that she testifies everywhere, both within man and without him, to a lost God and a corrupt nature."15 The "inscrutable tides of God," then, in part reveal to Ishmael death and the "sharkishness" of nature and of human nature, as when he speaks of the Killer Whale: "Ex- ception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included " (Ch. 32). Pantheism identifies God with a world seemingly Satanic in certain of its literal terrors and evils. Yet to escape from the sensory world in order to apprehend a hidden and transcendent God as pure spirit and thought through the Cartesian mode of pure thought and methodic doubt is self-deceptive and Narcissistic. Platonic and Gnostic reveries, in a psychological realm of mind and im- agination alone, invite a form of pantheism which becomes solipsistic: "Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps ... in the fairest weather . . . you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever" (Ch. 35). 16 In rejecting the Cartesian exaltation of mind and thought, with its cor- responding mistrust of the senses and the material and literal world, Melville also rejects the idealism of Berkeley. In Mardi, his argument for the reality of literal experience assumes a comic tone: "my Right Reverend friend, Bishop Berkeley- truly, one of your lords spiritual-who, meta- physically speaking, holding all objects to be mere optical delusions, was, notwithstanding, extremely matter-of-fact in all matters touching matter itself. Besides being pervious to the points of pins, and possessing a palate capable of appreciating plum puddings."17 The relentless literalism of Moby-Dick- the cetological chapters, which stress the deficiencies of all epistemological methods seeking to know leviathan's essence and also in- cant facts, figures, and information, the detailed descriptions, catalogues, verisimilitude, histories, and leitmotifs of concreteness and definiteness -embodies and intensifies the physical, mimetic dimensions of Melville's allegory.18 Like Dante's allegory, which is corporeal and literal, Melville's representation of reality in Moby-Dick consistently invokes the "plain facts," for the "fabulous narrations [of whaling] are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whaleman" (Ch. 41). Since Mardi, Moby-Dick, and Billy Budd are allegorical, Melville's feigned fear that some of his readers would believe the whale- or his narrative- to be "a hideous and intolerable allegory" (Ch. 45) is complex; the form, for Melville, was "intolerable" only when a sense of literal and substantial reality disap- peared from its moral landscape and it dissolved into apparently pure</page><page sequence="7">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 147 abstraction.19 Gregory the Great said that the literal words of scripture at once "describe a fact, and reveal a mystery." Melville's incantatory literalism, in its attempts to evoke transcendent reality, its descriptions of the deific leviathan, and its delineation of characters, seeks the same end.20 Like Dante's allegorical mode, which is as firmly rooted in the "literal sense" of language and experience as Scholastic exegesis is rooted in the reality of the literal sense of Scripture- "nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of Holy Scripture," says St. Thomas21- Melville's mode sustains the literal actuality of experience, as here with Pip in a squall: "they're on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall!" (Ch. 40). The figural and metaphorical implications of Pip's words are inseparable from their literal dimension; his exhortation to "hold on hard!"- as directed to himself and to the crew- is a literal and moral utterance. Similarly, Ahab's character is persistently a substantial form: his "torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad" (Ch. 41). And when Stubb speaks with Flask - their recurring place in the narrative af- firms the continued presence of the concrete and sensory world even, or especially, when they interpret images in crass, naively literal, or altogether unthinking ways- he casually invokes a cosmic analogue without ever los- ing hold of the literal and sensible world: "I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;- if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There hammer that now down, and we've done." (Ch. 131) Melville's analogical imagination here uses the image of the anchor as "hand"- a recurring image in the narrative- without sacrificing the literal or transcendent elements in the scene and in Stubb's speculation. Whether Melville's imagination assumes an equivocal perspective, in which a nominalist multiplicity dominates, or an univocal one of unity and sameness, its analogical dimension- always located in literal existence and in representational images- persists in straining toward an understanding and reconciliation of apparently different but analogous forms of being.22 Given the traditional distinction among the three kinds of pilgrim- one who leaves home in body only but not in soul, and gains no merit; one who by desire leaves in spirit because circumstances prevent an actual</page><page sequence="8">148 W E R G E Journal departure; and the true pilgrim who leaves both in body and will- it is clear that Ishmael's journey is of this third kind. Charles S. Singleton's description of Dante's pilgrimage also approximates Ishmael's: "there un- folds the line of a literal journey given as real, and it is the body beyond, the flesh brought into these realms of spirit there, that like a catalyst precipitates everywhere the fleshed, the embodied and incarnate."23 Like Dante, he moves through the metaphysical and physical world in corporo, rather than seeking, like Ahab, to annihilate the concrete and bodily world through the unbridled power of his "great natural intellect" (Ch. 41) and avenging will. Ishmael's own intellect and will clearly aspire to a knowledge of ultimate reality; after Ahab's speech, his cry joins that of the crew. He is transfixed by the demonic fires of the try- works; understands Ahab's tragic "wisdom that is woe"; and rejects the "pitiful" port and finite land - "safety, com- fort, hearth-stone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities" (Ch. 23)- and celebrates a landless and shoreless state of in- finite consciousness and power. His fascinations with the "incantation of whiteness" and the deceptions of "deified Nature" are inseparable from his awareness of indefiniteness, non-being, and the "thought of annihila- tion" (Ch. 42). Whiteness, "at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian's Deity," is, like the very "princi- ple of light," the "intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind" (Ch. 42). Despite the dangers inherent in his itinerarium mentis, however, Ishmael's metaphysical desire to know whether the divine order is real remains intense: "I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus. . . . With a frigate's anchors for my bridle- bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!" (Ch. 57). Yet Ishmael's intellect and imagination are not thoroughly "angelic" and therefore hostile to finite reality, nor is his will vengeful and destruc- tive.24 Late in the narrative, he calls Ahab's pride "fatal." He suddenly is called back to the light after gazing too long into the fire and losing, literal- ly and allegorically, a sense of teleological direction: "Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy hand on the helm!" (Ch. 96); he warns, after acknowleging the wisdom that is woe - a wisdom he attributes to Pascal, among others: "but there is a woe that is madness" (Ch. 96); and he locates forms of truth in the same "lower" images of land and limitations he dismisses earlier (Ch. 94). He includes in his re- flections on whiteness images of holiness and awe: Abraham, angelic</page><page sequence="9">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 149 presences, the redeemed in the Book of Revelation, and the enchanting and "wondrous bodily whiteness" of an albatross he saw while at sea, and ends the reflections by describing the hunt for the white whale as "fiery."25 And man's dread before what seems to be a demonic nothingness and pure light, Ishmael suggests throughout "The Whiteness of the Whale," may be awe before ens, or Being itself. St. Bonaventure, in an earlier itinerarium mentis, defines the paradox: since Being exists "through itself and of itself," it "must be thought of as absolutely primal" and "derivative neither from nothing nor from anything." But often the in- tellect "does not consider that which is its primary object and without which it can know nothing." just as the eye intent upon the various differences of the colors does not see the light by which it sees the other things ... so the mind's eye, intent upon particular and universal beings, does not notice Being itself, which is beyond all genera. . . . Wherefore it seems . . . that just as the bat's eye behaves in the light, so the eye of the mind behaves before the most obvious things of nature. Because accustomed to the shadows of beings and the phantasms of the sensible world, when it looks upon the light of the highest Being, it seems to see nothing, not understanding that darkness itself is the fullest il- lumination of the mind [Ps. 138:11], just as when the eye sees pure light it seems to itself to be seeing nothing.26 Ishmael's desire to make the leap of knowledge from the whale to heaven, and, by extension, a Kierkegaard-like leap of faith in the supernal order as the deepest form of knowledge, is neither Gnostic nor bestial, but pro- foundly human. In light of his Protestant epistemology, however, no "lad- der" of natural theology is accessible to Ishmael's potential climb- "The one who beholds what is invisible of God, through the perception of what is made," says Luther, "is not rightly called a theologian," but rather "the one who perceives what is visible of God, God's 'backside' [Exod. 33:23], by beholding the sufferings and the cross."27 Yet Ishmael's intellect and imagination, while gravitating toward fideism or even skepticism, do not banish the real and sensible world; rather, they seek to "make friends of these usual enemies [the senses]" so that the apparently remote Object of faith and the objects of sense will no longer be antithetical .28 He wills to believe, as Pascal says, that Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them. (No. 265) For Pascal as for Descartes, thought is man's "whole dignity and his</page><page sequence="10">150 W E R G E Journal whole merit." Yet since the Author of being must be the end in which the thought of the self finally rests, man's "whole duty is to think as he ought" (No. 146). This "ought," for Pascal, is inseparable from faith; yet, according to Pascal, Descartes' exaltation of thought removes God from the world and the consciousness and results in misere: thought without faith or object, and hence man abandoned by God. Indeed, although Descartes' methodic doubt theoretically results first in the doubter's cer- tainty of the existence of his own self - the cogito, ergo sum; then in his forming of a "clear and distinct idea" of God: and finally in his belief in the sensory and external world on the ground that God would not deceive him, the potential terrors of Descartes' cogito are considerable. As Ber- trand RusseU recapitulates Descartes' argument, man, a "thing that thinks," needs "no place or material thing for its existence."29 In abrogating free will and constructing mutually exclusive but parallel worlds of mind and matter, soul and body, Descartes concentrates so fully on the primacy of mind that the world of apparent sense borders on dissolving in- to pure thought, and the self into discontinuity and dissolution as well: "I think" is his ultimate premiss. Here the word "I" is really illegitimate; he ought to state his ultimate premiss in the form "there are thoughts." The word "I" is grammatically convenient, but does not describe a datum. . . . He nowhere proves that thoughts need a thinker, nor is there reason to believe this except in a grammatical sense, (p. 565) Ahab inhabits just such a fluid and indeterminate world of pure thought, and his quest for infinite power and consciousness, the "mono- maniac thought of his soul," severs his mind from his body (Ch. 44). The ferocious intensity of his intellect and will generates not only a projection of his own fantasies and guilt onto Moby Dick (Ch. 41), but also a nothingness whose vacancy gives way to demonism and therefore a state of non-being at once Gnostic and bestial: What seemed Ahab . . . was but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light ... but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Pro- metheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart forever; that vulture the very creature he creates. (Ch. 44) Cut off from any sense of actuality, concreteness, and moral order in the visible "signs" of the natural as well as the human world, Ahab's mind becomes a self-created world of will and idea. His "blankness in itself</page><page sequence="11">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 151 reflects the traditional conception of evil as privation, absence, and non- being. So "angelic" does his imagination become that nothingness and bestiality become inextricable and reflect his place in the chain of being by echoing Pascal's observation that "he who would act the angel acts the brute" (No. 358): He was ... an alien to [Christendom]. . . . And as ... that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom! (Ch. 34)30 In this setting, Simone Weil's commentary on metaphysics may cast light on significant dimensions of Ahab's odyssey: one cannot get hold of things as they are in themselves . . . one can only try to construct their equivalent by deduction. The mind is never in contact with its object. We are subject to irksome constructions, hypotheses, which have to give the best possible account of appearances. Here, as everywhere else, the human condition is such that men move towards something perfect which they never achieve and which they cannot even conceive. Human dignity is to realize this. If one wants to escape from it, one sinks even lower. (Pascal: 'He who wishes to become an angel, becomes a beast.')31 The possibility that Ahab's mind might be "in touch with its object," of course, is undercut by his consistent rejection of the ontological integrity of literal and mundane objects. He casts his pipe into the sea, comes to em- brace the most phantom-like and demonic of his fellows, and, like Carte- sian thought, seems to need "no place or material thing for [his] existence." The intensity of his phenomenological imagination, as when it sees only "Ahab, Ahab, and Ahab" in the markings on the doubloon, denies and supplants any potential object of belief external to Ahab himself. His deified will denies a supernatural and sacred reality, whether envisioned as an objective order or Being, and with it a sacramental view of nature. Edwards had argued that the figural significance of the natural order had to be interpreted through the Scripture; the transcendentalist im- agination frequently circumvented "mediating images" or any traditional hermeneutic, as it were, in order to apprehend God and nature directly; Emerson insisted that imitation was a corrupt act, that self-reliance was all- sufficient even when the self was ostensibly demonic, and that even our ex- perience of the good excludes memory and any concrete form, guide, or principle of mediation:</page><page sequence="12">152 W E R G E Journal When good is near you ... it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man . . . [or] hear any name;- the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience.32 Yet for the aspiring voyager in malo, such a rejection of memory, exam- ple, mediation, and mimesis, and corresponding exaltation of the autonomous self, could constitute a darker result. Mircea Eliade describes the "new existential situation" of "modern nonreligious man" and therefore the evil dimension of Ahab's quest: he regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and he refuses all appeal to transcendence. . . . Man makes himself, and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world. The sacred is the prime obstacle to his freedom. He will become himself only when he is totally demysticized. He will not be truly free until he has killed the last god.33 Ishmael's attempts to find some point of contact, reciprocity, or even identity between the world of sense and the act of faith, however, do not reject the sacred. He wills, like Eliade's figure of "religious man," to believe that "the existence of the world itself 'means' something, 'wants to say' something, that the world is neither mute nor opaque, that it is not an inert thing without purpose or significance . . . [but that] the cosmos 'lives' and 'speaks.'"34 In addition, Ishmael waits upon and experiences manifestations, revelations, or what Eliade calls "hierophanies" of a numinous sacral order and presence throughout his voyage.33 His search in the natural order for what St. Bonaventure, writing in the Augustinian and Franciscan tradition, calls sensible "signs divinely bestowed," or the "shadows, echoes, and pictures, the traces, simulacra, and reflections" of God (11.11), expresses his desire to discover an analogia entis, and, once discovered, to understand and to participate in it. For Tillich, the question whether a segment of finite reality can provide the basis for claims about the infinite must be answered affirmatively, for everything participates in being-itself: The analogia entis is not the property of a questionable natural theology which attempts to gain knowledge of God by drawing conclusions about the infinite from the finite. The analogia entis gives us our only justification of speaking at all about God.36</page><page sequence="13">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 153 In the Scholastic tradition, as Joseph A. Mazzeo states, "analogy" in- evitably signifies the kind and proportion of the relationship between God and creation, Being and the created order. In light of the complexities of Melville's vision, Mazzeo's argument concerning the nature of their rela- tionship is especially significant: There cannot be identity between the two, for this would mean pantheism, nor can there be utter disparity between the two kinds of being or man would have no knowledge of God at all.37 Even an epistemology based on revelation and faith, then, would presup- pose some sense of an analogy of being. Ishmael often places nature, leviathan, and, given the persistently Biblical and religious imagery with which he characterizes them, Divinity, beyond human comprehension and therefore in a realm of being wholly different from man with only "utter disparity" between them. Yet the problematic spectre of a thorough-going pantheism or idealism also recurs in the narrative. In his view of nature, Ishmael is always aware of dualism, polarity, and paradox. For Pascal, nature could "prove" God's presence only to those who believe in God on other grounds, and his Jansenist vision, with its emphasis on faith as an act opposed to reason or nature, takes special account of what Pascal claims is "the astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made us of nature to prove God" (No. 243). In a similar way, nature for Luther- and to a strong but lesser extent for Calvin - is a veil and mask pierced only by faith; even man's acknowledge- ment that nature necessitates a Creator does not inevitably lead in turn to a willing and "affective" acceptance of God in the form of a loving Savior.38 Luther's fideism here is evident, for "more often than not," he could "find no reason for believing in God on the basis of ordinary observation of the world." The dichotomy of nature and grace, sense and faith meant that to Luther "the world appeared ... as a spectacle of disorder rather than of order, or unreason rather than reason, of injustice rather than of justice. His faith triumphed over his inclinations, as in the famous asser- tion that the essence of faith is to believe God just though he looks so terribly unjust."39 Yet often accompanying the fideist strain in the religious traditions with which Melville was most directly conversant is a respect for the significance of the natural order and its representative images. Although the Puritans, like the Reformers, viewed nature as fallen and corrupted by sin, they also kept a place for "the doctrine that men learned, or could learn, from Nature Taking the light of nature to mean either the inward light of in-</page><page sequence="14">154 W E R G E Journal tuition or the external light of creation, the Puritans held that though dimmed by the clouds of sin, it still gleamed not ineffectually."40 Even Pascal states that "Nature has some perfections to show that she is the image of God, and some defects to show that she is only His image" (No. 579). Ishmael echoes his observation in his analogical description of the contrast between the birds, or thoughts, of the benevolently angelic and "feminine air," and the thoughts embodied in the creatures of the demonic and "masculine" sea: Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps; far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea. (Ch. 122) Yet only their sex differentiates these orders of being, reflects Ishmael; this apparent dualism is ultimately a unity. And Scripture, St. Augustine and other Church Fathers, and Luther and Calvin also dramatize the sea in similar ways. Edwards, echoing them, delineates these realms and creatures: The birds represent the inhabitants of heaven. These appear beautifull above the beasts and fishes; many of them are decked with glorious colours ... fly with wings and are above all kinds of animals, employ themselves in musick, many of them as it were sweetly praising their creatour. The fishes in the waters under the earth represent the inhabitants of hell. The waters in Scrip- ture is represented as the place of the dead, the Rephaim, the destroyers; and whales and sea monsters that swim in the great deep are used in Scrip- ture as emblems of devils and the wrath of God, and the miseries of death and God's wrath are there compared to the sea, to the deeps, to floods and billows and the like.41 The mystery, of course, as in Blake's "Tyger," is that the same God is the Creator of these seemingly antithetical, Manichaean words. "As well hate a seraph as a shark," says Melville in Mardi: "Both were made by the same hand" (Ch.13). In IshmaeFs search for signs of divinity in the natural and sensible world and for their analogical significance for man's condition, his awareness of evil, darkness, and emblematic devils is acute. Yet he also becomes aware of signs of goodness, light in bono, and the benevolently angelic presences Starbuck calls "blessed influences" (Ch. 38). The gleeful porpoises, the "most pitiable" whales wounded by their incessant hunters and, like birds with clipped wings, "vainly trying to escape the piratical hawks" (Ch. 81), and the sun, seem to be sacramental images. When a herd of whales en- circles the ship, small, tame cows and calves touch it, and Queequeg pats</page><page sequence="15">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 155 their foreheads. Ishmael is entranced by several infant whales, one still tethered to its dam: as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast . . . and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence; even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us ... in their new-born sight. (Ch. 87) The peaceful and moving love between mothers and calves elicits from Ishmael a sense of sacral kinship with all forms of life, and his memory of the time and image, even as "planets of unwaning woe" turn around him, causes him to "bathe" in an "eternal mildness of joy." This hierophanic experience, like the others Ishmael recounts, exemplifies his conviction that while the "invisible spheres were formed in fright," the visible world, in many of its aspects, seems "formed in love" (Ch. 42). Although the revelations of divinity in the created order do not enable Ishmael to infer the divine nature with the clear mathematical certitude of the Cartesian ideal, then, neither do they lead him to complete skepticism, ambiguity, or nihilism. All "signs" give "hints" of things which "must ex- ist," he states, and his empirical observations of the visible creation locate forms of goodness as well as evil and examples of love as well as apparent malevolence. In gazing at leviathan, "glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts," Ishmael finds an analogue to his own situation: rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions bow and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor in- fidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye. (Ch. 85) The Augustinian doctrine of illumination, Platonic rather than Aristotelian in its origins and emphasis, as much as the Kantian "Reason," provides a gloss for IshmaePs state. Doubt is always pervasive but not final. Again, the tensions between faith and doubt, hope and sense experience - as when Ishmael reflects on death and the possibility of the resurrection and states that "Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope" (Ch. 7)- are marked. They are also strikingly analogous to Pascal's uncertainty toward the problematic significance of a nature which reflects love and terror and</page><page sequence="16">156 W E R G E Journal engenders the mists of doubt and the intuitions of faith: Nature presents to me nothing which is not a matter of doubt and concern. If I saw nothing there which revealed a Divinity, I would come to a negative conclusion; if I saw everywhere the signs of a Creator, I would remain peacefully in faith. But, seeing too much to deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied; wherefore I have a hundred time wished that if a God maintains nature, she should testify to Him unequivocally, and that, if the signs she gives are deceptive, she should suppress them altogether; that she should say everything or nothing, that I might see which cause I ought to follow. (No. 229) Ahab, of course, longs for the same unequivocal testimony from Divini- ty. Yet he repudiates mediating images fraught with meaning- or "hints" -in a way neither Pascal nor Melville does, despite their uncertainties, doubts, and moments of intuitive faith which are indistinguishable from il- luminations of grace. The nature of the analogic entis and man's place in the great chain of being, Pascal indicates, rests on the reality of grace: "it clearly seems that man by grace is made like unto God, and a partaker in His divinity, and that without grace he is like unto the brute beasts" (No. 4347).42 In a similar way, the authenticity of man's search for a definite or at least a proximate knowledge of reality is not to be found in incessant doubt, for, as Wittgenstein notes, "If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty."43 For Ishmael especially, the desired end of the "hint" could not be perfect equilibrium, even assuming that one could in fact attain to such an absolute balance of belief and disbelief; rather, its essence is sacramental and incarnational, as in T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets: These are only hints and guesses, Hints followed by guesses; and the rest Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action. The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.44 Yet the soul's desire and quest to discover whether divinity, imagination, and the literal world can be reconciled, and whether uncertain or, even "lost" earthly images- both natural and human- can indeed be "restored" as part of an intelligible analogia entis and order of salvation, constitute a formidable peregrination. For Ishmael as for Melville, if not for the figures of Dante's Ulysses, Emerson's autonomous pilgrim who does not need the "footprints of any other," and Ahab, any such journey of spiritual exploration, if it is not to be destructive, requires a guide.</page><page sequence="17">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 157 II In terms of the religious dimension of Melville's allegory, the most im- portant human exemplar of the "gift half understood" by Ishmael is Queequeg. Other figures are clearly and persistently significant: Pip, whose direct vision of God imbues him with a "divine madness"; Starbuck, the reverent Quaker in whose eyes and beliefs Ahab reads his own deepest needs and reality even while resisting the "good angels" Starbuck calls upon; and Father Mapple, whose Calvinist thought and piety are evident in his sermon on Jonah's rebellion, repentance, and deliverance and in his gesture of kneeling; although Mapple does not utter Christ's name, Jonah's traditional importance as a preflguration of Christ's death and resurrection is clear.45 Yet Queequeg embodies "prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action" and becomes a mediating form and even a "hermeneutic" for Ishmael. Father Mapple proclaims the Word of God through Scripture and ser- mon. Although he and the pulpit reveal the "meat and wine of the word" (Ch. 8), he does not administer the Eucharist, but "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions." He dramatizes, then, the Calvinist emphasis on the proclamation of the Word of Scripture to the individual worshiper, each of whom, says Ishmael, "seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable" (Ch. 7). The communal life, ritual, and the substantial, tactile, and mediating image are subordinated to the sovereign God of power and deliverance. As Ishmael returns to join Queequeg in his idolatrous ritual, however, the liturgical contrast is evident. He consistently describes Queequeg's Yojo - a definite representative of his god with a specific name - as an "image," just as he will describe Queequeg's personal markings and the markings he will inscribe on his coffin. The comic tone of the scene, in which Ishmael must "turn idolator" in order to follow God's will by uniting with his fellow man in his worship rather than insisting on the rightness of a "particular Presbyterian form" of worship, addresses the most seminal concerns of the narrative. Ishmael asks: "How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping this piece of wood . . . But can ... the magnanimous God of heaven and earth . . . possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible!" (Ch. 10); and then, after a ceremony, "weds" Queequeg in a commitment and honeymoon of friendship which adumbrate their being tied together in the face of death, and, of course, Queequeg's culminating "substantial image"- the coffin</page><page sequence="18">158 W E R G E Journal which literally becomes IshmaeFs life-preserver. For Queequeg, ritual embodies and reflects the sacred world, and images are indispensable to it. The sacred has being and reality for him, and Yojo, for example, becomes its literal image: "By manifesting the sacred," Eliade argues, "any object becomes something else, yet it continues to re- main itself, for it continues to participate in its surrounding cosmic milieu. ... for those to whom a stone reveals itself as sacred, its immediate reality is transmuted into a supernatural reality . . . [and] for those who have a religious experience all nature is capable of revealing itself as cosmic sacrality."46 Throughout the narrative, Ishmael continues to be "wed" to Queequeg- "this soothing savage had redeemed [the wolfish world]"- and to apprehend in him a sacramental order of being in which the sacred and supernatural, and unearthly and natural dimensions of experience are cojoined.47 For the Puritans, however, who stress St. Paul's strictures in Romans 1. against idols rather than his apparently simultaneous acceptance of a kind of "natural theology" (Rom. 1:20), God is a pure spirit, and "all carnal Imaginations ... are to be abhorred."48 Samuel Mather would see IshmaePs "marriage" as an act of whoredom and adultery, for idolatry is "a breach of the Marriage Covenant, and a yielding that honour to another, to a Creature, to an Idol, which is due to none, but God."49 As for Ishmael's rhetorical question concerning God's jealousy, God is indeed a jealous God: "now the Object of jealousie is Conjugal Chastity, and as jealousie is the rage of a man, so the jealousie of God is the highest wrath of God."50 Calvin had condemned the images of idolatry in equally strong language. They are projections of man's corrupt imagination, not mimetic reflections of reality, and they supplant God's glory by the divinity man in- vests in them. God prohibits all graven images, says Calvin, because His glory is "corrupted by an impious falsehood whenever any form is attached to him," and this prohibition "restrains our waywardness from trying to represent him by any visible image. . . . without exception he repudiates all likenesses, pictures, and other signs by which the superstitious have thought he will be near them."51 There can be no analogia entis through the similitude of images, for since God is veiled, His majesty is "sullied by an unfitting and absurd fiction, when the incorporeal is made to resemble corporeal matter, the invisible a visible likeness, the spirit an inanimate object, the immeasurable a puny bit of wood ..." (Bk.l.xi.2). Calvin rebukes Gregory the Great's idea that images are "the books of the uneducated" as well as the Nicene recommendation of the</page><page sequence="19">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 159 veneration of images, for all images reflect man's fallen and untrustworthy imagination: "Man ... is a transient being, and yet he will want to be counted as God a piece of metal, to whose deity he himself gave origin" (Bk.l.xi.4). As in Bultmann, Barth, and other Protestant "existential" theologians, images and ritual must recede, and even be deliberately "crucified," if true experience of the divine reality is to be attained by grace.52 The lessened emphasis in Calvinist and Puritan thought on sacramen- talism, the doctrine of the Incarnation, and the analogous or referential forms of the imago Dei embodied in concrete images, lends weight to Perry Miller's argument that what persists in American thought from cove- nant theology to Edwards and Emerson is "the Puritan's effort to con- front, face to face, the image of a blinding divinity in the physical universe, and to look upon that universe without the intermediacy of ritual, of ceremony, of the Mass and the confessional."53 Although Ahab sees analogy in the created order- *"O Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.'" (Ch. 70)- his radically dualist vision, in which mind still dominates, precludes the presence of any point of intersection, or incarna- tional and sacramental relationship between the two worlds. Ahab rejects the mediating images of nature and man because he wishes, as has been said of Luther, "to speak to God directly." Ahab's denial of the reality of mediation between the numinous and the human and his utter isolation from others and the chain of being as he embraces his own deified power echo Ulysses' voyage to a terrifyingly "unpeopled world." People, like signs and images, become unreal to him, as when Stubb laughs at a wrecked boat and Starbuck interprets the boat as an omen: "'Omen? Omen? the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man, they will honorably speak outright; not . . . give an old wives' darkling hint.- Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!'" (Ch. 133). Ahab's univocal and angelic imagination repudiates nature, signification, and all identities, natural and human, besides his own consciousness. Like a more recent but equally haunted character who does all that he can to avoid the "threatened intimacy of creation" - when "the Lord's call came, he wished it to be a voice from out of a clear and empty sky . . . untouched by any fleshly hand or breath" - 54 Ahab's mind and will turn away from literal beings and</page><page sequence="20">160 W E R G E Journal images in order to pursue a self-generated and fantastic vision. Yet even in rejecting the external world and, presumably, all mimetic rituals, Ahab's angelic imagination proclaims itself "lord" over the Pequod and parodies in diabolical ritual the sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist. As his Canticle, the FiorettU and the Speculum Perfections make clear, St. Francis "loved the sun and fire with most affection."55 After [Brother] fire, "he most singularly loved water, by which is figured holy penitence and tribulation, whereby the filth of the soul is washed away, and because the first ablution of the soul is by the water of baptism" (p. 293). As a literal reality and sacramental figure, wood, like water and fire, both embodies and points to a divine order. Ahab, however, would "strike the sun" if it insulted him; baptizes the harpoons in the "sacramental" fires "//i nomine diaboli"; and parodies the most significant and divinely analogical center of the Christian faith, the Eucharist.56 His "murderous chalice" perverts the Incarnation as well as the suffering and caritas of the Passion into a rite of self-glorification, or, as Ishmael will later call it, "fatal pride." The source and end of the ritual is Ahab's autonomous and "angelic" self, seeking to parody and therefore to escape all literal and mimetic forms. Ultimately, he will destroy his only remaining "guide"- the "heavenly quadrant"- in order to annihilate all possible sacramental images of mediation between the self and its imagined object, whether they stem from God, nature, or the "incarnational" truths of rituals which seek to participate in the divine reality. For Melville, as for Twain in the Holy Land, Protestantism tended to become pure mind. Twain noted in The Innocents Abroad that the gods of his childhood had been "remote and very far away," that Christ seemed a "mysterious stranger," and that at the shrine of the Annunciation he could not fit his imaginary angels into "niches of substantial stone." The phe- nomenon of relics clearly was abused; yet had not the Roman Catholic Church so emphasized the actual concreteness of spiritual experience, no images, shrines, or relics would exist. As Melville too sensed post-Kantian idealism excluding the reality of visible, mediating images and elevating pure subjectivity and will, the abyss between God and finiteness intensified and several of the consequences seemed, to say the least, melancholy. If the self might not transcend images, as Calvinism feared, or might generate and magnify its own images only to be consumed by them, as Ahab appears to do, such mediating images also came to seem indispens- able because the self is literal and imaginative, rather than a pure thought. Without images, God may become resplendent in His transcendent divini- ty, like the "supreme lord" and commodore in White- Jacket. He may also become amorphous, or, like one dimension of whiteness, the quintessential</page><page sequence="21">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 161 nothingness- which is perhaps the ultimate blasphemy against a God who became finite, particular, and human, even to his crucified and resurrected body. "Virtue," writes Melville of the same aloof commodore, "though her mandates be outwardly observed, bears little interior sway. To be ef- ficacious, Virtue must come down from aloft, even as our blessed Redeemer came down to reveal our whole man-of-war world; to that end, mixing with its sailors and sinners as equals."97 As early as 1832, Emerson denied the efficacy of the sacraments as a means or a seal of grace. God was not limited and finite, so no ritual could reflect, imitate, or participate in His being. Of this action, Flannery O'Connor writes: "When Emerson decided . . . that he could no longer celebrate the Lord's Supper unless the bread and wine were removed, an important step in the vaporization of religion in America was taken, and the spirit of that step has continued apace. When the physical fact is separated from the spiritual reality, the dissolution of belief is ... in- evitable."58 The "wedding" between the nominal Calvinist but doubting Ishmael and the believing Queequeg is predicated on Melville's conviction that faith is drawn by, and finds expression in, visible images and mimetic rituals. Queequeg's faith is bound up with images- a candle, Yojo his idol, a representation of the god to whom he directs his attentive prayers, and his rituals of self-denial, including fasting, and of preparation for death. His consistent awareness of the sacramental is an expression of religious rather than desacralized man. Homo religiosus, says Eliade, "always believes that there is an absolute reality, the sacred, which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real. He further believes that life has a sacred origin and that human ex- istence realizes all of its potentialities in proportion as it is religious- that is, participates in reality. ... By reactualizing sacred history, by imitating the divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods - that is, in the real and significant."59 Queequeg's actions recall to mind that even for St. Augustine, the sacramentum was not limited to Baptism and the Eucharist. He refers to all the following, among others, as sacramenta: the sign of the cross, exorcisms, contemplation, the penitential garment, the bowing of the head, penance, reconciliation, and fasts. All are of spiritual importance, and all are externally visible.60 Queequeg's visible faith and rituals echo the Augustinian and Franciscan "literalism of the imagination," with its mimetic and incarnational em- phasis. In The Essence of Christianity, Feuerbach noted modernity's self- conscious preference for the image rather than the thing and for ap- pearance rather than being. Yet in "primitive" societies, the image and</page><page sequence="22">162 W E R G E Journal thing are united. As Susan Sontag points out, "For defenders of the real from Plato to Feuerbach to equate image with mere 'appearance' - that is, to presume that the image is absolutely distinct from the object depicted- is part of the process of desacralization that separates us ab- solutely from the world of sacred times and places in which an image was taken to participate in the reality of the object depicted."61 Queequeg rein- cants this identification between image and ontological reality through his adoration of limited forms as incarnations of divinity; in so doing, he em- braces not the Gnostic plenitude of infinite consciousness but the sacramental nature of being, and of human beings, as real and substantial forms. He exemplifies William F. Lynch's contention that, the heart, substance, and center of the human imagination, as of human life, must lie in the particular and limited image or thing. ... the finite is given metaphysical form in the concept of haecceitasy the pure and absolute //titftess-and-not-thatness which . . . Scotus saw in all things; in the "in- scape" which Hopkins . . . saw in everything; in the single farthing of the Gospel, which was the key to salvation; and in the little sensible things which were the source of insight for St. Thomas." It is in this setting that Queequeg's importance as a kind of literal and intercessory angel can best be understood.63 He is associated with angels throughout the narrative, and the cross which is his "signature"' is that of St. Andrew, the patron saint of sailors. In diving into the sea to rescue a crewman- one of the "mongrel renegades" of the ship - and into a dissected whale to rescue another, he makes two salvific gestures which an- ticipate his coffin's role as IshmaeFs preserver. Ahab severs his ties to Pip, Starbuck, and his wife and child. Although he often sees "through a glass darkly," Ahab at one point sees his wife and child reflected in the "magic glass" of Starbuck's eye (Ch. 132) - the image echoes the traditional con- ception of the world as a "mirror of sensible things" in which, as St. Bonaventure states, "God is contemplated not only through them, as by His traces, but also in them, in so far as He is in them by essence, potency, and presence" (Il.i.)- but he will not allow their images, their reality, to change his mind or affections. If the apprehension of truth "occurs in affective experience rather than in rational consideration," then, it is clear that Ahab's will, and not only his mind, is lacking a good intention and a proper object. Ahab has "his humanities," to be sure- his affection for Pip and Starbuck, his fond if fleeting and ineffectual memories of home, his sporadic but moving con- cern for others - but he cannot or will not sustain them.64 His most pro- foundly "human" moments suggests the "pain of loss" - traditionally, the most horrible torment of the damned - as when, after having established</page><page sequence="23">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 163 his affinity for his "fiery father" of power and destruction and having lamented that "my sweet mother, I know not" (Ch. 119), Ahab momen- tarily views the world not as a cruel and forbidding "stepmother," but as an affectionate, maternal, and forgiving mother whose actions echo those of the father in the parable of the prodigal son: [she] did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. . . . Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop. (Ch. 132) The value of the tear, which breaks through the frozen dimension of Ahab's heart, is infinite; the tiny image remains precious. Tears, says Ed- wards, are figures of "godly sorrow flowing from spiritual sight of knowledge."65 But unlike the "one poor tear" of contrition which ensures Buonconte da Montefeltro's salvation when a good angel rescues his soul from a demon just before his death (Purg. V.), Ahab's tear of momentary sorrow or contrition incants no angel; his quest is unwavering. In projecting his own guilt and sorrow onto Moby Dick, Ahab is able to deny or to forget his own guilt and complicity in the human situation. He wills to "dismember [his] dismemberer" (Ch. 37), even though he, Ahab, is the original hunter and dismemberer. Ahab is "damned in the midst of Paradise" (Ch. 37) in part because he chooses to seize his own sin and evil- his pride, repudiation of fraternity, and will to absolute power- and, in imputing it to external forces and beings, to deny and to preclude his own need for forgiveness. His refusal to search for the lost son of the Rachel's captain, despite his own paternal feeling and longing for his "lost mother" of tenderness and mercy, dramatizes Ahab's situation. Ahab makes his refusal, as one scholar has said, "with specific denial of his own actual fatherhood and in a spirit of marked sadness";66 yet the solipsism of the act makes it difficult to see Ahab's "awful vengeance" as a "heroic self-sacrifice, and act of renewal and redemption affirming ultimate human possibility" (p. 137). No plight- not even Ahab's- is as excruciating as that of the father of the lost son of the Rachel; but Ahab abandons him, and the child, to the sea. After Ahab rejects his entreaties and states, "'God bless ye, man, and may I forgive myself, but I must go'" (Ch. 128), Ahab's isolation and damnation are assured. His use of the reflexive, as in his acts of self-crucifixion, makes Ahab the beginning and end of his own world. To forgive oneself-? No, that doesn't work: we have to be forgiven. But we can only believe this is possible if we ourselves can forgive ... he who * forgives' you- out of love- takes upon himself the consequences of what you have done. Forgiveness, therefore, always entails a sacrifice.67</page><page sequence="24">164 W E R G E Journal Ahab grasps the hand of Starbuck, but cannot weep as Starbuck does and so ends their handshake moments before they die; he clutches Pip's hand, and, "full of the sweet things of love and gratitude," feels prouder leading him '"than though I grasped an Emperor's!'" (Ch. 125). Yet because for Ahab there is no intercession between divinity and humanity -"see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man" (Ch. 135)- no analogia entis&gt; the earthly clasping of hands cannot be sustained. But Queequeg's hand, at once echoing a numinous, supernatural image the memory of which remains awesome to Ishmael (Ch. 4) and a literal reality, intercedes between Ishmael and the divine order and between Ishmael and others. Ishmael, then, through Queequeg, who consistently acknowledges that he is "in the hands of his god," is able to squeeze "literally and truly" the mysteriously palpable life of the whale and to urge everyone to "squeeze hands all round": man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country. ... In visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti. (Ch. 94) The angels touch and grasp the spermaceti; as in Scripture and tradition, they are at once creatures of pure intellect, yet literally real and intercessory. The substance of this "angelic vision" is not rarefied but incarnational. Before Queequeg wills not to die - in a sudden "conversion" and move- ment like those of the angels - he prepares for his death with a visible faith, a coffin which becomes a ship in bono pointing toward home and immortality, and an embracing of finite realities. In a mysterious way, "his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity." In a series of specific gestures, he calls for objects to be placed in the coffin: a paddle, biscuits, fresh water, some earth, sail-cloth, and Yojo. He "shudder[s]" at the thought of being "tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks"- his fate were he to be buried, according to custom, in his ham- mock-and so his coffin becomes a "canoe," like those in which Nan- tucket whalemen are buried. This tradition and image of Nantucket are "not unlike the custom of his own race, who . . . stretched [the dead war- rior] out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry arch- ipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way" (Ch. 110).</page><page sequence="25">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 165 The coffin-canoe is especially "congenial" to him because, like a whaleboat, it is without a keel and involves both "uncertain steering" and "much leeway" down "the dim ages." Queequeg does not romanticize, but fears, the sharks; believes in heaven and immortality according to his own faith and tradition, but retains as necessities the sacramental objects of literal experience; combines an active and a passive, expectant will by in- sisting on the coffin-canoe while giving up the keel and placing his soul in the hands of divinity; and embraces once again the ontology of images and objects in the form of the ship which acknowledges death as limitation, peaceful immortality as the specific end of hope and faith, and existence as a tactile and teleological voyage moving toward a definite home. Queequeg comes to represent what G. K. Chesterton calls "the human instinct for a heaven that shall be as literal and almost as local as a home." It is the idea pursued by all poets and pagans making myths; that a par- ticular place must be the shrine of the god or the abode of the blest; that fairyland is a land; or that the return of the ghost must be the resurrection of the body.61 Ultimately, Queequeg marks the coffin with figures and drawings, as if in imitation of the tattooing on his body, and these marks are in turn analogous to a mystical treatise on heaven and earth. Concrete and mimetic images become part of a divine analogy and coalesce in the coffin- ship which literally saves Ishmael from the Cartesian vortex of destruction. It is especially significant that Ahab, wedded like Ulysses to his autonomous ship of fire and consuming vision of infinite experience and will, seeks to reject the literal actuality, and does reject the moral, allegorical, and anagogical "sign" of Queequeg's coffin. He tries to shut out the "accursed sound" as the carpenter builds it as well as its very visibility: '"I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.'" Although he considers the possibility that the coffin might be the literal embodiment and "in some spiritual sense" a sign of personal im- mortality, his denial becomes the culmination of his commitment to a Gnostic spirit of mind and thought divorced from palpable reality and, for Ahab, also from hope: "Oh how immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but im- ponderable thoughts? Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most en- dangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! Til think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its</page><page sequence="26">166 W E R G E Journal other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me." (Ch. 127) As Ahab momentarily leans on Starbuck because his ivory leg has been splintered, he acknowledges, movingly, his limitation and dependency: '"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has"' (Ch. 134). Yet despite being "splintered to pieces," Ahab quickly reaffirms his "own proper and inaccessible being" in its complete isolation. His final gesture of hatred is both intense and suicidal, and his death has about it an inex- orable and self-willed justice. The intensely Biblical language and echoes of the scenes- Starbuck's pietistic invocation of "good angels" and the name of Jesus, Ahab's demonic evocation of loneliness, hell, and damna- tion - reinforce the contention that even when Ahab-like man seeks to "free" and "purify" himself from religious meanings and "forms himself by a series of denials and refusals," he inevitably is "haunted by the realities that he has refused and denied."69 If Ahab's nihilism - and some theologians identify nihilism itself as the "wrath of God"- constitutes an attack on his own conscience and on the very conception of an imago Dei in man and an analogia entis in which man participates, his quest can end in no other way: It was odd- this fury to deface, because, of course, you could never deface enough. If God had been like a toad, you could have rid the globe of toads, but when God was like yourself, it was no good being content with stone figures - you had to kill yourself among the graves.70 With the "smallest chip" of the Pequod splintered and lost, covered by the rolling of the "great shroud of the sea," and echoing the Book of Wisdom (Douay, 5:10)- "as a ship that passeth through the waves: whereof when it is gone by, the trace cannot be found, nor the path of its keel in the waters"- Ishmael is miraculously delivered from the vortex by a "vital centre" and leans on Queequeg's coffin: "Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirge- like main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks." Ahab's Cartesian voyage without a guide or the concreteness of mediating images rooted in an ontological order ends in the same shipwreck as the voyage of Dante's Ulysses, since it necessitates its own destruction by seeking the an- nihilation of the visible and limiting world. For Ishmael, however, the wood, a literal image of land and finiteness, at once coffin and ship, is</page><page sequence="27">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 167 mysteriously sanctified by the carved images of the believing Queequeg and assumes the form of a literal grace- an incarnate and intercessory "hint half guessed" and "gift half understood" of love Ishmael can accept and lean on- and Ahab cannot: Even in the most intense activity, this feeling of unreality - in you who have never come 'close' to another. The old fairy tale: the one who has been made invisible or transformed into a beast can only regain his human shape through somebody else's love.71 In Scripture, in such Church Fathers as Augustine and Chrysostom, and in the late medieval, Calvinist, and Puritan exegetical traditions, the voyage in bono of the faithful soul assumes the dramatic form of the ship made from or bound to the wood of the Cross or simply bearing its image. In Mardiy Melville's main voyager bears "a characteristic device upon the . . . arm. . . . Our Saviour on the cross, in blue; with the crown of thorns, and three drops of blood in vermilion, falling one by one from each hand and foot" (Ch. 47). A symbolic character of pure thought, struck by the image, tries to seize it, "little heeding, that like a landscape in fresco, it could not be removed." In White- Jacket, Melville observes a crucifix on the arms of the ship's Roman Catholic sailors, for whom the image ensures burial in consecrated ground. But, he adds, many sailors not Catholics were anxious to have the crucifix painted on them, owing to a curious superstition . . . that if you have that mark tat- tooed upon all four limbs, you might fall overboard among seven hundred and seventy-five thousand white sharks, all dinnerless, and not one of them would so much as dare to smell at your little finger. (Ch. 42) In a literal and allegorical sense, Queequeg's coffin-ship, as a redemptive image, embodies in its mysterious but mimetic hieroglyphics the incarna- tional significance of the Cross- the concretely literal image, in its most sacramental dimension, of matter redeemed and sanctified by divine love, and man identified with and embraced by an incarnate and suffering God. The allegory moves toward this culmination, as in Father Mapple's sermon of deliverance, Queequeg's significance in its angelic and human dimen- sions, and the Rachel, the "mother of Israel," faithfully and lovingly seek- ing the lost son for whom Ahab had refused to search, which rescues Ishmael even as the literal extension of Queequeg, to whom Ishmael re- mains "wed," preserves him until that moment. Like Dante-pilgrim, Ishmael does not "sink or swim," but is led, sustained, and saved by others.72 Limitation, humility, and reciprocity rather than the angelic imag-</page><page sequence="28">168 W E R G E Journal ination and the will to infinite consciousness and power, and a waiting attentiveness to mediating and sacramental images of revelation rather than the seizing of truth from a wholly transcendent divinity, mark the con- cluding tone of the narrative. Much earlier, Ishmael happily includes Queequeg in the "same ancient Catholic Church" to which everyone in "the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world" belongs and in which they all "join hands" (Ch. 18). Queequeg crystallizes the view of God as a "principle of limitation," in Whitehead's phrase, rather than an infinite emanation of pure spirit. "An element in the metaphysical situation," Whitehead writes, "is that such a principle is required. Some particular how is necessary, and some particularization in the what of matter of fact is necessary." Lacking this specificity, he continues, the "apparent irra- tional limitation" of the real world will make its concreteness and par- ticularity seem illusory to the aspiring mind and searching imagination. we must provide a ground for the limitation which stands among the at- tributes of the substantial activity. This attribute provides the limitation for which no reason can be given, for all reason flows from it. God is the ultimate limitation. . . . 73 The "visible and palpable promise here below, the sure basis of hope," says Simone Weil, is that brute force is not sovereign in the world, for it is "by nature blind and indeterminate." What is sovereign in this world is determinateness, limit ... a network, a web of determinations. The universe accepts passively. The brute force of matter, which appears to us sovereign, is nothing else in reality but perfect obedience.74 To see all earthly forms of being through a faith in the goodness of limitation and finiteness and in the reality of intercession is, for Melville, to enhance rather than to denigrate their ultimate value. Even his cosmic vi- sion of Heaven in Mardi celebrates "matter"- the particular and historical nature, as well as the transcendental essence, of ultimate reality: The New Zealander's tattooing is not a prodigy. ... No custom is strange; no creed is absurd; no foe, but who in the end will prove a friend. In heaven, at last, our good, old white-haired father Adam will greet all alike, and sociality forever prevail. Christian shall join hands between Gentile and Jew; grim Dante forget his Infernos, and shake sides with fat Rabelais; and monk Luther, over a flagon of old nectar, talk over old times with Pope Leo. Then, shall we sit ... by the minstrels, who sang in the Milky Way when Jesus our Saviour was born. . . . Then shall Kant be forgotten, and</page><page sequence="29">Dante's Ulysses and Ahab's Voyage 169 another folio ... be turned over for wisdom; even the folio now spread with horoscopes as yet undeciphered, the heaven of heavens on high. (Ch. 3) Melville's tone is comic and epic, his sentiment quintessentially American -and human. His more general language never becomes so abstract or amorphous as to lessen the literal concreteness and reality of details, iden- tities, and images. Melville's religious imagination does not value pure, autonomously transcendent consciousness so much as Incarnation - or man's search for it and attentiveness to its revelations- and the sacramen- talism of objects, images, and humanity itself which, ideally, would pro- ceed from it. Faith, like the imagination, is for Melville most sharply defined and realized in its recognition of, and respect for, the mystery of being, even when being is intelligible, and in its conviction of an actual on- tological order external to the self and to which the self, as part of the analogy of being, is somehow related throughout the fluctuations and discontinuities of consciousness and experience. In light of his Calvinist and fideist awareness of man's fallenness, and of the uncertainties attending man's attempt to apprehend the ontological order, Melville never underestimates the inherent difficulties of realizing these ideas: "ever since Adam," he writes to Hawthorne, "who has got to the meaning of this great allegory - the world? Then we pygmies must be content to have our paper allegories but ill comprehended."75 In whatever ways one interprets the allegories, it is clear that, for Melville, one must be attentive to and even accentuate their irreducibly literal reality and con- cretely substantial forms. Only then might the "angelic" dimension of the imagination become sympathetic and intercessory and therefore most real. Notes 1. Studies in Classic American Literature (Garden City, N.
