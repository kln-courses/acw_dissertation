<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Baird Callicott Conceptual resources for environmental ethics in Asian traditions of thought: A propaedeutic I Environmental ethics first came on the scene in the early seventies in the form of relevancy offerings in progressive philosophy curricula primarily at teaching- oriented undergraduate institutions.1 The first literature in environmental ethics, correspondingly, took the form of hastily assembled multidisciplinary antholo- gies for classroom use.2 Then in the mid-seventies, environmental ethics became more narrowly defined as a subdiscipline of philosophy, and there began to be produced a more specialized, technical philosophical literature, not directly designed for or related to pedagogy.3 By the end of the decade a journal was established by Eugene C. Hargrove (the first volume was published in 1979) to provide both a forum and professional identification and recognition for envi- ronmental ethics as a legitimate area of philosophical inquiry.4 Superficially, environmental ethics appears to be one among several new fields of "applied ethics," all originating almost simultaneously in the same context of curriculum reform in mid-century academic philosophy. The other principal fields of applied ethics are biomedical ethics and business and professional ethics. Generally, applied ethics (epitomized by biomedical and business and pro- fessional ethics) applies familiar, well-worked-out (and worked-over) ethical theory- utilitarianism in its multifarious forms, Kant, Aristotle, Hare, Rawls, or whatever-to novel problems emergent in modern technology: life support systems, genetic screening, genetic engineering, organ transplantation, and so forth in biology and medicine; and whistle blowing, mass media manipulation, electronic eavesdropping, global market control, and so forth in business and the professions. Environmental ethics, on the other hand, is actually a sort of anti-applied ethics. The problems which taken together constitute the so-called "environ- mental crisis" appear to be of such ubiquity, magnitude, recalcitrance, and synergistic complexity, that they force on philosophy the task not of applying familiar ethical theories, long in place, but of completely reconstructing moral theory (and a supporting metaphysics) in order adequately and effectively to deal with them. Environmental ethics, in other words, begins with the assumption that traditional metaphysics and moral theory are more at the root of environ- mental problems than tools for their solution. Environmental ethics, therefore, has been more critically and theoretically oriented than the other historically grounded and narrowly problem-centered species of applied ethics. Environ- mental problems provide less the occasion for the exercise than for the sweeping reconstruction of Western moral and metaphysical paradigms. I attempted to articulate this difference clearly in a recent, synoptic article in a mainstream philosophy journal: J. Baird Callicott is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Philosophy East and West 37, no. 2 (April 1987). ? by the University of Hawaii Press.

As with anything new in philosophy or the sciences, there has been some controversy, not only about its legitimacy, but about its very identity or definition. The question of legitimacy has been settled more or less by default: professional philosophical interest in environmental philosophy seems to be growing as, certainly, work in the field proliferates. The question of identity-just what is environmental ethics?-has not been so ingenuous. Environmental ethics may be understood to be but one among several new sorts of applied philosophies, the others of which also arose during the seventies. That is, it may be understood to be an application of well-established conven- tional philosophical categories to emergent practical environmental problems. On the other hand, it may be understood to be an exploration of alternative moral and even metaphysical principles, forced upon philosophy by the magnitude and recalcitrance of these problems. If defined in the former way, then the work of environmental ethics is that of a philosophical yeoman or underlaborer (to employ Locke's self appraisal); if defined in the latter way, it is that of a theoretician or philosophical architect (as in Descartes' self-image).5 A less than entirely sympathetic philosopher, Thomas E. Hill, agreed with this general assessment in a review of a recent collection of essays in environmental ethics: The underlying project in almost all of the essays... is the search for fundamental theoretical grounds for an environmentalist stand on current issues. Unlike much recent work in medical ethics, the focus is not on deciding what should be done in "hard cases" posed by new technology. A wide area of agreement on what should be done seems to be taken for granted by the authors; their concern is rather how to articulate the philosophical grounding of environmentalist policies. Is a radical revolution in ethics required? Is traditional Western religion adequate to the task? Do alternative world views provide better models? Should ethical theory abandon the fact/value distinction-or return to belief in "intrinsic values"?6 Ip Po-Keung has clearly and simply set out the principal philosophical prob- lematic of environmental ethics, so conceived, as follows: I take it that the major task of environmental ethics is the construction of a system of normative guidelines governing man's attitudes, behavior, and action toward his natural environment. The central question to be asked is: how ought man, either as an individual or as a group, to behave, to act, toward nature? By "nature" I mean the nonhuman environment man finds himself in. Surely, a question of this sort presupposes the appropriateness of the application of moral, ethical concepts to nature, viz., stones, fish, bears, trees, water, and so on. ... Any viable environmental ethics, it seems to me, should provide adequate answers to three questions: (1) What is the nature of nature? (2) What is [the nature of man]? and (3) How should man relate ... to nature?7 The complex of problems constituting the "environmental crisis" (in chrono- logical order of their popular notice) are environmental pollution, the aesthetic degradation of nature, human overpopulation, resource depletion, ecological destruction, and, now emerging as the most pressing and desperate of problems, abrupt, massive species extinction. These problems, which are essentially West- ern in provenance if not presently unique to Western civilization, are not only big, tough, and global in scope, they are peculiar in that they appear to have</page><page sequence="3">117 resulted from both (1) a fundamental (that is, metaphysical) misunderstanding of the nature of nature and (2) an exclusion of nature from moral concern or consideration in Western thought. Hence, to begin adequately to address environmental problems and eventually to ameliorate the environmental crisis, (1) metaphysical foundations must be brought into alignment with ecology-the principal basic science of the environ- ment-and (2) ethical theory must be enlarged so as to include within its purview both nonhuman natural entities and-since the proposed metaphysical revision, most generally conceived, subverts the concept of ontologically independent entities-nature as a whole. The theoretical project of environmental ethics on each of these two heads-the metaphysical and the axiological-has two basic phases, the first critical, the second constructive. II Initial criticism (mostly by intellectual historians, not philosophers-who were slower to react) focused, simplistically, on the so-called Judeo-Christian tradi- tion.8 This criticism was primarily cosmological and metaphysical, but had clear moral implications and overtones. These seem to be the main points which came under attack:9 1. God-the locus of the holy or sacred-transcends nature. 2. Nature is a profane artifact of a divine, craftsman-like creator. The essence of the natural world is informed matter: God divided and ordered an inert, plastic material-the void/waters/dust or clay. 3. Man exclusively is created in the image of God and thus is segregated, essentially, from the rest of nature. 4. Man is given dominion by God over nature. 5. God commands man to subdue nature and multiply himself. 6. The whole metaphysical structure of the Judeo-Christian world view is politi- cal and hierarchical: God over Man, Man over Nature-which results in a moral pecking order or power structure. 7. The image-of-God in Man is the ground of man's intrinsic value. Since nonhuman natural entities lack the divine image, they are morally disen- franchised. They have, at best, instrumental value. 8. This notion is compounded in the later Judeo-Christian tradition by Aristote- lian-Thomistic teleology-rational life is the telos of nature and hence all the rest of nature exists as a means-a support system-for rational man. A particularly strident, but representative and widely influential example of this first, essentially nonprofessional phase of the criticism of Western metaphy- sical and moral traditions from an environmental point of view was expressed by landscape architect Ian McHarg: The great western religions born of monotheism have been the major source of our moral attitudes. It is from them that we have developed the preoccupation with the uniqueness of man, with justice and compassion. On the subject of man-</page><page sequence="4">118 Callicott nature, however, the Biblical creation story of the first chapter of Genesis, the source of the most generally accepted description of man's role and powers, not only fails to correspond to reality as we observe it, but in its insistence upon dominion and subjugation of nature, encourages the most exploitative and destructive instincts in man rather than those that are deferential and creative. Indeed, if one seeks license for those who would increase radioactivity, create canals and harbors with atomic bombs, employ poisons without constraint, or give consent to the bulldozer mentality, there could be no better injunction than this text. Here can be found the sanction and injunction to conquer nature-the enemy, the threat to Jehovah. The creation story in Judaism was absorbed unchanged into Christianity. It emphasized the exclusive divinity of man, his God-given dominion over all things and licensed him to subdue the earth.10 In the most general sense, modern Western intellectual culture is rooted in Greco-Roman as well as Judeo-Christian thought. In my opinion, the Greco- Roman legacy, which is less visible to lay persons than to philosophers, more powerfully informed the prevailing assumptions and premises of Western thought than distinctly Judeo-Christian ideas. The Greco-Roman legacy has, however, not received anything like the thorough and systematic critical discussion which has been visited upon the Judeo-Christian tradition by environmentally oriented, intellectual historians. Indeed, historian Lynn White, Jr., author of the landmark classic "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis," who is followed by historian J. Donald Hughes and political scientist John Rodman, all look to Greek myth and philosophy- pagan naturalism (a sacred nature), Milesian hylozoism (a living cosmos), Herac- litus (a process ontology), and Pythagoras (human-animal kinship) for ecolo- gically fitting or environmentally useful ideas.l1 The first Greek philosophy was natural philosophy, and although many ecologically adaptable or environmentally useful ideas were broached, the natural philosophy which was culturally selected by the dialectic of Western intellectual history, and thus survived to bequeath its characteristics to the modern period, is atomism. Nature, as represented in atomism, is particulate, reductive, material, inert, quantitative, and mechanical. This concept of Nature became institutionalized in early modern science and was pragmatically translated into an engineering agenda. It is expressed in the on-going Western Industrial Revolution by what is known as "modern technology."12 The environmental crisis may at least in part be diagnosed as a symptom and a measure of the mismatch between the atomistic-mechanistic image of nature inherited from the Greeks, institutional- ized in modern classical science and expressed in modern technology, on the one hand, and the holistic-organic reality disclosed by contemporary ecology (and in a sense by the environmental crisis itself), on the other. Greek humanism, meanwhile, which was revived and institutionalized in the West roughly contemporaneously with atomism, was paradigmatically expressed by Plato: Human nature is dualistic-composed of body and soul. The</page><page sequence="5">119 body (at least in Descartes' modern version) was, as was any natural entity, exhaustively describable in atomistic-mechanistic terms. The soul, on the other hand, resides temporarily in the body-it is the ghost in the machine-and is of an otherworldly origin and destiny. Human beings, thus, are both essentially and ethically segregated from nature. The natural environment, therefore, might be engineered to human specifications, no matter with what natural consequences, without either human moral responsibility or ultimate human penalty. To these observations might be added those of David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames, who find in Greek philosophy, especially as paradigmatically and most influen- tially represented by Plato, the concept of transcendental principles of natural and moral order. 3 The Platonic forms are a metaphysical hypostatization of a logico-mathematical order assumed to be imposed upon a passive and chaoti- cally inclined material to effect an ordered natural world. Modern ecology, on the other hand, represents the incredibly rich and complex order of the biosphere to be emergent and reciprocal, and for things to have become what they are through a process of mutual adjustment and evolutionary codetermination. Given this metaphysical and axiological conceptual composite at the core of the predominant and prevailing Western world view, the environmental crisis is the predictable, the inevitable, outcome, it was argued: ... Our failure is that of the Western World and lies in prevailing values. Show me a man-oriented society in which it is believed that reality exists only because man can perceive it, that the cosmos is a structure erected to support man on its pinnacle, that man exclusively is divine and given dominion over all things, indeed that God is made in the image of man, and I will predict the nature of its cities and their landscapes. I need not look far for we have seen them-the hot- dog stands, the neon shill, the ticky-tacky houses, dysgenic city and mined landscapes. This is the image of the anthropomorphic, anthropocentric man; he seeks not unity with nature but conquest.14 So, it was further argued, to solve the environmental crisis it is necessary to construct or to adopt a different metaphysic and a different axiology. III If environmental problems are ultimately rooted in the Western world view and value premises, it has been assumed, by contrast, that Eastern traditions would provide, for these essentially Western ills, an alternative metaphysic and axiology ready-made, as it were, to establish harmony between man and nature. This turn toward the East for a philosophical remedy for the environmental crisis, I conjecture, was subconsciously reinforced by a somewhat earlier (in the fifties) fascination with Eastern ideas in the then new prototype of disaffected/ alienated American subculture called the Beat Generation. The Beats read Alan Watts and Herman Hesse avidly, cut their hair close like Zen monks, and produced novels with titles like Dharma Bums. In the most widely read and quoted classic of early environmental ethics literature, Lynn White, Jr., makes the following revealing remark:</page><page sequence="6">120 Callicott What we do about ecology [that is, the natural environment] depends on our ideas of the man-nature relationship. More science and more technology are not going to get us out of the present ecologic crisis until we find a new religion, or rethink our old one. The beatniks, who are the basic revolutionaries of our time, show a sound instict in their affinity for Zen Buddhism, which conceives of the man-nature relationship as very nearly the mirror image of the Christian view. 1 5 West Coast Zen Buddhism and the newly emergent environmental movement were further integrated in the popular imagination by California nature poet and student of Oriental thought, Gary Snyder, in the late sixties. Among the most delightful as well as influential pieces by Snyder was his environmental "Smokey the Bear Sutra," which parodies the format of Mahayana Buddhist sutras but supplies it with an evolutionary-ecological metaphysics and environmental activ- ist message: Once in the Jurrassic, about 150 million years ago, the Great Sun Buddha in this corner of the Infinite Void gave a great discourse to all the assembled elements and energies: to the standing beings, the walking beings, the flying beings and the sitting beings-even grasses, to the number of three billion, each one born from a seed, were assembled there: a Discourse concerning enlighten- ment on the planet Earth. "In some future time, there will be a continent called America. It will have great centers of power called such as Pyramid Lake, Walden Pond, Mount Rainier, Big Sur, Everglades, and so forth; and powerful nerves and channels such as Columbia River, Mississippi River, and Grand Canyon. The human race in that era will get into troubles all over its head, and practically wreck everything in spite of its own strong intelligent Buddha-nature.... In that future American era I shall enter a new form: to cure the world of loveless knowledge that seeks with blind hunger: and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it." And he showed himself in his true form of SMOKEY THE BEAR.... Wrathful but Calm, Austere but Comic, Smokey the Bear will illuminate those who would help him; but for those who would hinder or slander him, HE WILL PUT THEM OUT. Thus his great Mantra: Namah Samanta vajranam chanda maharoshana Sphataya hum traka ham mam "I DEDICATE MYSELF TO THE UNIVER- SAL DIAMOND BE THIS RAGING FURY DESTROYED And he will protect those who love woods and rivers, Gods and animals, hobos and madmen, prisoners and sick people, musicians, playful women, and hopeful children; And if anyone is threatened by advertising, air pollution, or the police, they should chant SMOKEY THE BEARS WAR SPELL: DROWN THEIR BUTTS CRUSH THEIR BUTTS DROWN THEIR BUTTS CRUSH THEIR BUTTS And SMOKEY THE BEAR will surely appear to put the enemy out with his vajra-shovel.16 William R. LaFleur, somewhat more discursively than Snyder, linked the Mahayana Buddhist tradition to issues in environmental ethics in an article called "Sattva: Enlightenment for Plants and Trees in Buddhism." Apparently regarding sentiency, a la animal liberationist Peter Singer, as a necessary condi- tion for moral standing, LaFleur reviewed, in his scholarly discussion, the debate in ancient Mahayana over the consciousness of plants, stones, and mountains.</page><page sequence="7">121 He concluded that the East was way ahead of the West in acknowledging a more extended class of sentient beings and thus an expanded moral community.17 Yale biophysicist Harold Morowitz, in a 1972 discussion, attempted more explicitly (and more cognitively) to link the metaphysical implications of contem- porary ecology with a specific ontological doctrine in Zen Buddhism: In a book entitled Science and Buddhism, P. Dahlke has elaborated the thesis that in theology everything stands, in science everything falls and in Buddhism everything burns. The notion of burning is a metaphysical expression of tran- sience and impermanence.... Although the Buddhist syntax is entirely different from that of modern science, the notion is clearly present that everything is process-a process which only persists by virtue of some universal kind of energy flowing through the world. From this point of view, the reality of individuals is problematic because they do not exist per se but only as local perturbations in this universal energy flow. As originally presented this must have been a very mystical idea, but a similar kind of idea seems to emerge from modern science. Everything we know of is indeed process, which is mediated on the surface of our planet by the flow of solar energy through all organized structures.... Viewed from the point of view of modern [ecology], each living thing, includ- ing man, is a dissipative structure, that is, it does not endure in and of itself but only as a result of the continual flow of energy in the system. An example might be instructive. Consider a vortex in a stream of flowing water. The vortex is a structure made of an ever-changing group of water molecules. It does not exist as an entity in the classical Western sense; it exists only because of the flow of water through the stream. If the flow ceases, the vortex disappears. In the same sense, the structures out of which biological entities are made are transient, unstable entities with constantly changing molecules, dependent on a constant flow of energy from food in order to maintain form and structure. This description stands as a scientific statement of the Buddhist notion of the unreality of the individual.18 This first round of criticism of Western ideas and orientation to the Orient in early prephilosophical environmental ethics was not only critically shallow, it was programmatic and ill-informed re: Asian philosophies. The very different traditions of Eastern philosophy, particularly those of the Indian subcontinent and those of the Far East, were conflated-so that it ap- peared that just as there was one fairly unified Western tradition, there was one fairly unified Eastern tradition. For example, in a celebrated classic of environ- mental history, Roderick Nash wrote: Ancient Eastern cultures were the sources of respect for and religious venera- tion of the natural world.... As early as the eighth century B.C., the Indian philosophy of Jainism proposed that man not kill or harm any living creature. While the Jains were largely intent on maintaining absolute detachment from the world, early Buddhists and Hindus professed a feeling of compassion and a code of ethical conduct for all that was alive. Likewise, China and Tibet produced philosophies which honored life other than man's and promulgated elaborate dietary rules in this interest. In the Far East the man-nature relationship was marked by respect, bordering on love, absent in the West.... Man was understood to be a part of nature. And wilderness, in Eastern thought, did not have an unholy or evil connotation but was venerated as the symbol and even the very essence of the deity. As early as the</page><page sequence="8">122 Callicott fifth century B.C., Chinese Taoists postulated an infinite and benign force in the natural world.... Far from avoiding wild places, the ancient Chinese sought them out in the hope of sensing more clearly something of the unity and rhythm that they believed pervaded the universe.... In linking God and the wilderness, instead of contrasting them as did the Western faiths, Shinto and Taoism fostered love of wilderness rather than hatred.19 Huston Smith, whose academic post as Professor of Philosophy at MIT and whose books and articles on Eastern philosophy and religion provide him no excuse, is guilty of a similar conflation: Asia retained a deep, unquestioning confidence in nature, appreciative of it, receptive to it. Had the Chinese and Indians not risen above the natural plane at all, they would not have spawned civilizations. The way in which they did transcend it, however, was by confirming it. They dignified it by affirming it consciously. By contrast the West oppositioned [sic] herself to nature in a stance that was reserved and critical. Its civilization receded progressively from the natural and instinctive and set itself up against them.... China with her "Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao" and India's Upanishadic truth that can be comprehended only through living in the presence of a life through which it actively shines ... hold closer to [the] tacit dimensions of knowing.20 In addition to the broad popular appeal of Gary Snyder's work, these remarks by Lynn White, Roderick Nash, and Huston Smith are typical of early environ- mental ethicists and were also widely influential. (Those of Morowitz and LaFleur are less typical, albeit more interesting and insightful, and they were certainly less influential.) There has been, however, very little subsequent work which carries through on these early, rather casual suggestions, and practi- cally none by scholars whose expertise is primarily in Asian and comparative philosophy.21 Some recent work by specialists in Asian thought is particularly exciting from the point of view of environmental ethics, even though no comparative reference either to environmental concerns or the description of nature in the environ- mental sciences (ecology first and foremost) is to be found in them. For example, Cheng Chung-ying has written: I think that we can derive the following three principles from the Confucian and Taoist metaphysics, which will lead to a characterization of causality in the Chinese perspective. There is, in the first place, a principle of holistic unity.... Second, there is the principle of internal life-movements. By this I mean that all things in the world have an intrinsic life-force which moves them in a way in which motion is not imposed from other things or a God but is derived from the inexhausible source of energy of life, which is the Way. As the source is intrinsically related to an individual thing, the derivation of energy for movement is intrinsic as in an organism rather than extrinsic as in a machine. Similarly, as all things are interrelated to form a network of interchange of processes, the transmission of moving force is conceived of as an exhibition of life activity, in the absence of which the individual things will cease to be defined....</page><page sequence="9">123 Finally, there is the principle of organic balance. By this I mean that all things and processes in the world are related in processes which proceed toward a balance and a harmony.... The model of causality in Chinese philosophy is exactly contrary and converse to the mechanical-atomistic model of scientific Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Whereas the Western scientific concept of causality is atomistic, externalistic, and mechanistic, the Chinese model of causality is anti atomistic and therefore holistic, antiexternalistic and therefore internalistic, anti- mechanistic and therefore organistic. The very radical difference between them is not difficult to explain: It is the difference between the Image of Life and the Image of Machine. Insofar as life is a concrete experience of man and a machine is built from an abstract design and quantitative draft, one may also say that the Chinese model of causality is basically reflective of the concrete experience of life, history, and time, whereas the Western scientific model of causality is basically a reflection of abstract thinking and quantitative calculation.22 The metaphysical, if not causal, model emerging from the environmental sciences (ecology first and foremost) is remarkably similar to Cheng's character- ization of Chinese philosophy. From the point of view of ecology, the natural world is not, as represented in classical Western science, an aggregate of essen- tially independent entities; it is relationally unified. It remains, however, differen- tiated; its unity is that of an integrated system. To that extent, a metaphysical model of ecology is "holistic," and/or "organic." Perhaps most importantly, natural entities in ecology are internally related, that is, they are mutually determining.23 Neither God, nor Platonic forms, nor Aristotelian essences define beings in the natural world. Rather, species adapt in ecology to a niche in the ecosystem. Their interactions with other species sculpt their outward form, and metabolic, physiological, and reproductive processes, and even their psychological and mental capacities. A natural being is therefore literally inconceivable in ecology in isolation from its environment. All natural beings are interwoven into a complex four-dimensional and dynamic matrix. The essentially interrelated and mutually defining nature of the participants in the ecosystem is what most differentiates its mode of organization from that of a mechanism. In a machine the parts are separable and determined by an externally imposed design, and the function of the machine as a whole is reducible to the sum of its several parts. IV Let me attempt to provide a summary of the notions congenial to ecology and/or useful to environmental ethics that are supposed to repose in Eastern thought. Hindu and Jain thought provides at first glance, at least, an attractive and useful axiology for environmental ethics in the concept of a single inner sub- stance, be it Atman or Brahman, residing in all living things, indeed, in all phenomenal things without exception.24 If all things are one in essence, then native self-love, egoism, upon realization of this fact, is transformed into a general love of all other beings-that is, phenomenally "other" beings, since they are not really other than oneself.</page><page sequence="10">124 Callicott As Eliot Deutsch succinctly expresses it, In order for us to work out a proper relation with nature we must, I think, come to understand and to feel deeply a natural kinship with all life.... But what does it mean to affirm a continuity between man and the rest of life? Vedanta would maintain that this means the recognition that fundamentally all life is one, that in essence everything is reality, and that this oneness finds its natural expression in a reverence for all living things. The term ahitsd, of noninjury to all living creatures, is cast in the negative, a-himisd, but its import is clearly positive. It calls for a loving care of everything in nature. It demands that we accept the responsi- bility of being guardians of, as well as participants in, the natural order and balance of things.25 The Indian idea that in essence all things are one historically influenced Western moral thought beginning with Schopenhauer. It implies a radical expan- sion, relative to the usual Western models, of the ethical base class or community of morally considerable beings. Somehow to provide moral considerability to nonhuman natural entities has been the leading axiological problem for environ- mental ethics from its inception.26 Schopenhauer's radical quietism based upon the dialectical development of his voluntarist interpretation of Indian substantial monism appears to have been the primary inspiration for Albert Schweitzer's reverence-for-life ethic-suggested by some contributors as an early paradigm for an environmental moral theory.27 I personally do not endorse the Schweitzerian reverence-for-life approach to environmental ethics because of its tendency to limit moral consideration to individual things, that is, conversely, to provide no moral consideration for wholes-populations, species (especially), biocoenoses, and the global ecosystem-and its tendency to regret and condemn the most fundamental processes of evolutionary and ecological biology, namely, that the life of one thing is purchased necessarily by the death of others.28 A similar world-denying or even world-loathing affective tone appears to be even more pronounced in classical Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism-indeed, in all the philosophies indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. Further, Eliot Deutsch has seen in the metaphysical monism of Hinduism a match with the metaphysical monism of ecology.29 This supposition of corre- spondence is premature, I think, because it fails to distinguish between the very different ways in which things are thought to be one in classical Indian thought, on the one hand, and in contemporary ecology, on the other. In classical Indian thought all things are one because all things are phenomenal and ultimately illusory manifestations or expressions of Brahman. The unity of things is sub- stantive and essential and the experience of it homogeneous and oceanic. In ecology, the oneness of nature is systemic and (internally) relational. The multi- plicity of living things retains ultimately their separate characters and identities. But they are integrated into an ecosystem. The ecosystem is one organic, but articulate, whole. While remaining ultimately differentiated, the several things composing the ecosystem are further unified in respect to one another by being</page><page sequence="11">125 mutually defining or determining. And the experience of ecological unity is more aesthetic-like the experience of the unity of a symphony or a tragedy-than mystical and sympathetic.30 In Buddhism, as Morowitz points out, there is a fundamental denial of Hinduism's doctrine of a single substantive essence underlying all sensuously manifest phenomena. Buddhism, however, retains the principle of ahimtsd- merciful pity on all living things-but also, it seems, a profound disaffection for life as it is given in the phenomenal world (dynamic life, which is throughout motivated and driven by striving and desire) and which often seems to be identified with-as if that were its most salient characteristic-suffering, sorrow, or misery.31 Environmental ethics, however, requires an ethical attitude toward nature which is world-affirming, since its practical program is to integrate and harmonize with nature, not to become detached, or to deny or ignore it. Indeed, despite their metaphysical differences, the philosophies of the Indian sub- continent seem to share a pragmatic emphasis on either personal transcendence of or detachment from nature-at least as phenomenally manifested. That autistic indifference to natural phenomena does not provide, to my mind, the sort of affirmative, actively engaged moral attitude toward nature required for a proper environmental ethic. Probably for these more intuitively felt than intellectually expressed rea- sons, in the literature of environmental ethics more interest has been taken in Far Eastern philosophy, especially Taoism and, as I earlier pointed out, Zen Buddhism. Taoist ideas have been recommended firstly as a conceptual resource for the articulation of an ecological metaphysics. Clearly latent in ecology is a radical revisioning of the Western world view. The problem for environmental philoso- phy is how exactly to articulate, generally and abstractly, the fundamental conceptual reworking mandated by ecology. Perhaps Taoism provides a classical paradigm. (Since the quotations from Cheng Chung-ying and my earlier remarks have already outlined the main points of correspondence between Taoist meta- physics and the metaphysics emergent from ecology. I will not repeat them here.) Secondly, and more practically, Taoism is said to provide a philosophical foundation and rationale for what is known in environmental literature as an "appropriate technology." This is the burden of Russell Goodman's paper on Taoism and ecology: According to Taoist tradition, Lieh [sic] Tzu could travel by riding the wind. If he lived today, he might well be interested in wind-generated electricity. The Taoists sought accommodation to the natural cycles ... emphasizing the control that can be found thereby.... The logic of the Taoist attempt to gain by giving up is explored in their extended discussions of wu wei, "actionless activity" (literally "not doing").... [I]t is clear that the Taoists were not totally against technology. What they rejected was technology that went against the nature of things, that involved imposition of human "obsessions," a point developed in the Huai Nan Tzu:</page><page sequence="12">126 Callicott Now were there such a thing as using fire to dry up a well, or leading the waters of the Huai River uphill to irrigate a mountain, such things would be personal effort, and actions contrary to Nature. This could be called yu wei (action with useless effort). But using boats on water, sledges on sand, sleighs on mud, or litters on mountain-paths; digging channels for summer floods, arranging protections against winter cold, making fields on high ground and reserving low ground for marshes-such activities are not what may be called wei (or yu wei). The sages, in all their method of action, follow the Nature of Things. Though the distinction between yu wei and wu wei (as well as the distinctions between both of these and wei, action) is not easy to apply in every case, heating a house with nuclear fission-generated electricity is clearly a case of the former; passive solar heating an instance of the latter.32 Of all the Eastern traditions of thought, least attention by environmental philosophers has been paid to Confucianism. This is because there prevails an image of Confucius as "a conservative humanist occupied primarily, if not exclusively, with narrow ethical concerns" and of Confucianism as a backward- looking, tradition-bound body of stultifying custom and ritual.33 But the re- ceived interpretation of Confucius' teaching, if not Confucianism, is presently undergoing revision in the work of Herbert Fingarette, Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall, and Cheng Chung-ying.34 In my opinion, for environmental ethics, the most important revelation of this new work on Confucius is his concept of the human individual as contextually emergent and contextually defined. As Ip Po-Keung has so succinctly set out the problematic of environmental ethics, not only the nature of nature needs to be reworked in Western thought in the light of the environmental sciences; the nature of man and the man-nature relationship also need to be redefined. The prevailing modern Western concept of the human individual is not only other-worldly and dualistic (the Pythagorean-Platonic-Cartesian heritage), it is atomistic (paradigmatically explicated in the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes) as well. The human individual is a social atom, in other words. His or her inertial course is given by his or her interests or preferences. Social ordering is essentially a task of setting up traffic laws to minimize collisions among the social atoms as each pursues his or her inertial path. Individuality is substantive and essential- istic. One's individuality, in other words, is found in the peculiar combination of one's inner desires, preferences, and opinions, which differ more or less from the peculiar combination of desires, preferences, and opinions constituting someone else's individuality. Social relations are altogether external. My individual being is mine uniquely, endowed to me by my Creator; yours is yours, similarly conferred; and our relationship is one of compatibility, complementarity, con- flict, irrelevance, and so forth and so on. If Hall and Ames and the other recent Confucian scholars are right, Confucius understood the individual to be exhaustively defined by his or her unique social relations. This is the metaphysical doctrine of internal relations applied to the problem of human identity. Who am I-the son of my parents, the father of my son, the husband of my wife, professor of philosophy at UWSP, and so on and</page><page sequence="13">127 on. I am nothing apart from my context. In short, Confucius posits a social model of human individuality which is an analogue of ecology's model of species adapting to niches in the economy of nature and thus acquiring their specific characteristics. Now if we move up a level from the human community to the biotic com- munity, it will also be the case that each individual person and mankind as a whole are defined, exhaustively, by our respective individual and collective relationship to the natural environment. Therefore, if we adopt this generalized Confucian idea, it will be impossible to think of oneself or of mankind either as outside of or as opposed to or as transcendent of nature. The well-being of mankind and the well-being of the environment, the future of mankind and the future of the environment, the richness and complexity of human life and the richness and complexity of the environment will be inconceivable apart from one another. Zen Buddhism, as a Far-Eastern development of a tradition of Indian origin, has much in common with native Chinese Taoism.35 I have already noted that Harold Morowitz, correctly, I think, sees in the insubstantial ontology of Bud- dhism a model of and a means for articulating the most abstract metaphysical implications of the systemic character of nature disclosed by biophysical ecology. The peculiar aesthetic attitude of Zen toward nature might also give expression to a profound and autochthonous ecological insight. John R. Noss comments on a Basho haiku: An old pond, mirror still. Quick frog, slanting waterward. A liquid plop! [I]f one meditates on this haiku he [/she] realizes his [/her] oneness (non-duality) first with the pond, then the frog and finally the water-sound, and with all of them together.... [T]he object and its perceiver co-exist in a unified field.... Zen imparts both a sense of cosmic non-duality and an immediate aesthetic response to sensory reality.36 The inherent aesthetic quality of the momentary/eternal state of satori in Zen distinguishes it from the apparent negativity of nirvana in traditional Indian Buddhism. A remarkably similar sort of natural aesthetic stressing the integra- tion of self and nature is latent in ecology, as I have elsewhere pointed out.37 Let me draw this discussion to a close with a conclusion and a suggestion. In the relatively new literature of environmental ethics there has been an intense interest in finding new metaphysical and moral paradigms by means of which to establish a more harmonious and mutually fulfilling and beneficial relationship between man and nature. There has been a general assumption that Eastern traditions of thought could provide the conceptual resources for this project, and there has been a lot of loose talk (not excepting this discussion) about how they might. But, with the exception of a handful of essays, no direct and extensive work by experts in Eastern thought has been undertaken on the environmental</page><page sequence="14">128 Callicott ethic problematic. My suggestion is, therefore, that there is an opportunity for students of Eastern thought to contribute in a most welcome and important way to the literature of environmental ethics. The groundwork has been laid and the time is ripe. Environmental ethics may provide a new forum for the introduction, exercise, and application of Oriental thought in a heretofore largely Occidental field. NOTES 1.

Richard Routley's "Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental Ethic?" (Proceedings of the Fifteenth World Congress of Philosophy 1 (Sophia, 1973): 205-210), was a groundbreaking essay. Also seminal was Holmes Rolston III's "Is There an Ecological Ethic?," Ethics 85 (1975): 93-109. Somewhat less venturesome, but nevertheless significant, were the essays by philosophers William T.
