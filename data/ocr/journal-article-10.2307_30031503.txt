Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2006. ix + 276 pp. Illustrations, notes, and index. $49.95 (cloth); $22.50 (paper). The map, the census, the museum: in Benedict Anderson's famous formulation, these are key objects through which people personally unknown to one another construct themselves imaginatively as a nation.' In The Geographic Revolution in Early America, Martin Briickner examines the first of these, extending his study to include a wide range of geographic representations. His subtitle, Maps, Literacy, and National Identity, reflects the breadth of his concerns, for in this work he asks three different sets of questions. How were changes in mapping practices and geographical representations in the decades before and after the American Revolution connected to changes in other realms? How did the study of geography develop a distinct form of literacy, a literacy related to a "geographical consciousness"? And how do people develop an emotional attachment to a nation such that their identity with it becomes embedded within their personal sense of self? This is an important book in all three realms, of interest to historians of cartography, historians of literacy and the book, and to historians of the American Revolution/Early Republic and of comparative nationalisms. Because readers are likely to come to this book with familiarity with at most one or two of these subjects, they may well find some sections tough going. Moreover, Briickner brings to his study the distinctive disciplinary practices of literary scholarship; as an historian, I occasionally found arguments for which I would have expected different sorts of evidence and I sometimes had difficulty reading across the disciplinary divide. Nonetheless, this is a deeply erudite study, provocative and ambitious, and one that will reward patient attention. The sheer volume and variety of geographical representations Briickner uncovers is convincing evidence of the significance of geographical thinking to people in what would become the early United States, and the range of his evidence is one of the strengths of his study. In his opening chapter, Briickner argues that English-speaking colonists developed geographic knowledge that was primarily personal and local, and they did so through surveying individual Reviews in American History 34 (2006) 427-433 v 2006 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">428 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / DECEMBER 2006 plots of land. For this chapter, surveying manuals, surveyors' journals, and plats of surveyed land are his evidence. Beginning in the 1760s, people who contested British policies and then British sovereignty found a legitimating voice for themselves in the rhetorical figure of the North American continent. Certainly maps with their cartouches and political cartoons that included maps are sources for this discussion, but so are rhetorical strategies and oratorical practices. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, men like Noah Web- ster and Jedidiah Morse worked to make the geography of the nation and its constituent parts familiar to Americans not only through geography books and atlases, but also through primers and spellers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, geographical discourses were central to a number of important novels, and in the early nineteenth century, the publication of the travels of Lewis and Clark offered another genre of literature that contributed to the national imaginary. By the 1820s, Americans had so internalized the conventions of this wide variety of spatial representations that spatial metaphors and other rhetorical devices in newspaper essays had come to seem like natural bases for political argumentation. Not only maps, then, but also surveying manu- als, geography textbooks, children's primers, newspaper rhetoric, political cartoons, travelers' journals, and novels support Briickner's contention that geographical practices and texts became widely familiar to middling people in what is now the eastern United States over the course of the long eighteenth century. So why does he think this matters? One way in which geographical thinking was historically significant was in the connections between changes in geographical representations and power. Historians of cartography and geography, following the lead of the late J.B. Harley, have for the past twenty-five years concerned themselves with the connections between representation of space and other realms like political power.2 Like historians of technology more generally, historians of cartography no longer regard artifacts like maps and geographic descriptions as simply instrumental. Rather, maps and geographies are read as efforts, conscious or unconscious, to assert a particular interpretation of the significance of place and to command assent to that interpretation, whether it be the political extension of an empire's claims, the social boundaries between groups, or the spiritual significance of particular places in a landscape. Maps and geographies both reflect and affect people's interpretation of particular spaces, and these spatial understandings naturalize local political, social, and spiritual arrangements. The arc of change in the interpretation of the space that became the United States that Briickner describes is from a personal understanding of local places as distinct social communities, to the visualization of the bounded space that was initially the United States as a natural unity, to the understanding of west- ern portions of North America as destined to be incorporated into the United States. All of these entailed political consequences. As Briickner describes it, in</page><page sequence="3">GRONIM / Imagined Nation 429 1690 the British government mandated that all New England land claims be resurveyed and individuals' land titles be reaffirmed. The intent of the Brit- ish government was to render its colonies "as legible, predictable, and hence governable as possible" (p. 21). However, surveying plots of land was done locally, often by landholders themselves or other local men, and boundaries between adjacent claims had to be adjudicated face to face. The effect was to raise the visibility of the landscape in one's immediate environs, not to in- crease the visibility of British sovereignty. Surveying, then, served to reinforce the significance of local communities, rather than to enhance the extension of British power. When in the 1760s, however, widely dispersed colonists sought to join together in an effort to make themselves heard in London, they sought common grounds from which they could speak. Aware that British geographic discourse had long figured "America" as female and yielding or had personified it as an American Indian, one rhetorical strategy was to make the continent itself speak. The implicit argument was that contiguity of North American land naturally unified its occupants. Moreover, as expressed most effectively in Paine's Common Sense (1776), the rule of a huge continent by a tiny island was geographically, and thus politically, absurd. Attention to the geographical construction of the meaning of "continent" thus facilitated the political separation of colonists from Britain. Yet in the wake of the Revolu- tionary War, many people were conscious that simply inhabiting a contiguous space did not reliably engender allegiance to the newly formed political unit. Efforts to promote such allegiance to the new United States included maps that presented the nation as a distinctly bounded space filled in with varying but continuous topographic symbols that visually conveyed a seemingly natural unity. Schoolbooks stressed the spelling and pronunciation of American place names, and presented their lists in geographical order from north to south; by reciting these aloud, children would produce an "acoustic map" rendering "the national map as the soundscape encompassing a common linguistic identity" (p. 101, 106). Indeed, BrUickner asserts, in the 1780s and 90s, people were avid for maps and geography books that represented the nation, for such works helped them visualize the abstraction of the nation-state. By the time accounts of the journey to the northwest undertaken by Lewis and Clark's group were published beginning in 1807-accounts that began to familiarize American readers with the space beyond the Mississippi-geographic discourses gener- ally had become deeply and widely familiar to American readers. When, in the 1820s, the popular press began to advocate western expansion, their audi- ence was receptive and few questioned the initiation of an era of what would be, in fact, one of imperial aggression. Thus, in the long period between the 1690s and the 1820s, geographic discourses promoted some political arrange- ments and thwarted others: local communities over the extension of British imperial control, a unified colonial opposition over continued incorporation</page><page sequence="4">430 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / DECEMBER 2006 into the British empire, a single national state over a confederation of small republics, and an expansive American empire over the restraint of a nation within fixed borders. Historians in particular may well contest particular components of Briick- ner's arguments or may be stimulated to pursue lines of research that might modify Brickner's conclusions. For example, Briickner begins his history of colonial surveying with a 1690 British order to resurvey all private property in New England. In his telling, colonial surveying was a "top-down" histori- cal event, with colonists responding to the directive almost immediately and with its effects somehow involving all colonists, not just New Englanders. But most historians have found that colonial surveying proceeded slowly and unevenly, and was almost always in response to very local problems. Still, while historians might contest the details, I doubt they would overturn one of Bruickner's central insights: that for many colonists the act of surveying was a major venue for becoming conscious of spatial relationships, and that writing up the resulting plats would be one of their few acts of authorship. Indeed, historians who use evidence from surveyors have almost always regarded surveying as a rather simple and instrumental process rather than, as it is in Bruickner's hands, a site for creating and negotiating social relations and for developing a sense of one's personal place in a landscape. Similarly, Briickner sometimes makes assertions about the prevalence of something for which I looked in vain for evidence in the footnotes. For example, he argues that post-Revolutionary Americans "gave primacy to the textual over the visual" in their geographical pedagogy, in contrast to Europeans (p. 156). But his evidence consists of one American author in 1813, and one English one in 1736. It is entirely possible that Brtickner is right, but one would need to pursue the research to develop this comparison persuasively. Brtickner's second arc of historical change is the expansion of literacy among Americans, and specifically the centrality of geographic literacy to literacy more generally. As with the history of geographical practices, the relation- ship between literacy and other realms of historical change has long been a rich area for research. Since the work of Elizabeth Eisenstein and Walter Ong, historians, philosophers, and literary theorists have debated the connections among the material production of print; the practices of readers, political, social and religious change; and forms of interiority.3 In this arena, Briickner argues on a number of fronts simultaneously, a strategy which yields a number of fascinating insights but no single clear thesis about the relationship between the expansion of geographic literacy and other historical changes. Briickner argues that geographic representation constitutes its own genre of literature, that the skills necessary to decode graphic representations like maps and schematic texts like those common in geography books constitute a distinct type of literacy, that a spatial imagination is a critical component of</page><page sequence="5">GRONIM / Imagined Nation 431 literary genres like the novel as well as a potential subject of them, and that geographic literacy was widely embraced by a wide swath of Americans by the end of the eighteenth century because it "became fused to the standards of self-cultivation and literary taste" (p. 172). Throughout the book Briickner successfully demonstrates how geography functioned as a text, rather than simply as a context, and has wonderful evidence for the growing significance of maps and geographies, for by the late eighteenth century they appeared in objects as varied as paintings, wooden puzzles, and samplers. His discussion of formal geography texts like those by Jedidiah Morse argues that through works like these "the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbricated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization)" (p. 119). He shows the centrality of geography to novels like Royall Tyler's Algerine Captive (1797), wherein the hero travels the world and then home again, Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntley (1799), wherein the hero travels in unmapped space and through this nearly loses his sanity, and Brown's Jane Talbot (1801), wherein the heroine follows the travels of her love vicariously through geography books, a reading practice that threatens to become a kind of autoeroticism until she comes to share her love of geography through conversa- tion with neighbors. Thus were spatial thinking and geographic problematics at the center of both recognizably literary forms and more pedestrian print. In his discussion of the links between geography and literacy, Briickner offers many vivid moments, yet overall it was difficult for me to figure out what he is arguing about literacy beyond the distinctiveness of geography texts as a genre. And some arguments about literacy that Briickner offered baffled me. For example, Briickner showed a picture from a primer that illustrated the letter "z." The picture was labeled "Zealand" and showed a man with two maps under his arms, his arms crooked in such a fashion as to suggest the form of the letter. Briickner writes, "As the human figure associates maps with the alphabetic sign, it establishes a somatic link between the reader's body, the alphabetic reading material, and cartographic writing. Like the human alphabet, which instituted the notion that the body was subject to the authority and discipline of the written sign, in this example the alphabetized individual becomes intrinsically part of a largely commercial cartographic archive and expanded notion of geographic literacy" (p. 113). Here is an example of a place where I found myself gazing with bewilderment across a disciplinary divide. My difficulties reading some of Briickner's arguments no doubt stem from my unfamiliarity with debates among literary scholars and with their modes of argumentation. Nonetheless, I am not sure what would serve as evidence for the assertion that people regarded their bodies as "subject to the author- ity and discipline of the written sign." And nothing further in his discussion developed this reference to a "commercial cartographic archive," and so I was unsure what the weight of this phrase entailed.</page><page sequence="6">432 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / DECEMBER 2006 The third arc of historical change Bruickner traces is the development and direction of nationalist feeling, a process that entailed the enhancement of "geographical consciousness" and the fusion of personal identity with the nation's identity. "Consciousness" is both an appealing intellectual construct, implying as it does the promise of registering the personal significance of historical change, and one that is notoriously difficult to pin down. Certainly many historians have examined the compelling metaphors and collective social practices that engage the allegiance of a populace and are crucial to any sustained national formation. From David Waldstreicher's In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes (1997) to Lynn Hunt's The Family Romance of the French Revolu- tion (1992) to Thongchai Winichakul's Siam Mapped (1994), historians have examined the many ways in which people unify "us" in distinction to "them" and call themselves into being as a nation. Nonetheless, the intra-psychic processes through which an individual comes to experience him or herself as personally distinct yet simultaneously identical with each of his or her fellow nationals can be elusive. Here Briickner offers some marvelous accounts of intra-psychic events. In Briickner's perceptive reading of William Byrd's surveying accounts, Byrd's account of his work on the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina was a "mock-heroic imperial epic" in which surveying was "an invasive ma- neuver, in which a feminized space is geodetically penetrated and mastered" (pp. 39, 41). By contrast, Byrd's activities surveying land he was personally to possess "folds the depiction of the earth into an anthropomorphic double of the surveyor-author," a process in which "the land and surveyor merge" (pp. 40, 41). Briickner's explanation for the silences in Meriwether Lewis and Wil- liam Clark's journals after they left Ft. Mandan rests on the contrast between their spatial imagination and that of Indians. Before their departure from Ft. Mandan, Lewis and Clark had assiduously gathered geographic information from Mandan and Hidatsa informants about the territory they were to traverse, only to find that the material space they subsequently encountered had no relationship to the map they had constructed in their heads. What appeared to them to have been straightforward information about the course of rivers, scale, and direction were to Mandan and Hidatsa travelers information about the duration and difficulty of journeys, and the distribution of sites of historical and sacred significance. Lewis and Clark literally lost themselves in space, so lost that they couldn't articulate their experiences in writing. Through such analyses Briickner masterfully connects self and space. Yet this arc of change in geographical consciousness and national identity too needs more evidence and explanation. The last chapter in particular, on the turn to imagining expansion across the continent, is both very exciting and frustratingly short. "The realities of conquest," Briickner writes, "were the direct expression of the American people's newly geographic sensibility"</page><page sequence="7">GRONIM / Imagined Nation 433 for "the geographically literate eye desired to see the map extending neatly across the entire continent, achieving not only a political imperative but an aesthetic one" (pp. 238-9). In this chapter Brtickner asserts that after the War of 1812 interest in local geography waned, replaced by interest in territory on and beyond the nation's margins. This is both interesting and plausible, but he offers no evidence for it. The final sentence of the book, "In reality, the assumption that imperialism could be tamed by a people's self-government was just that, a fantasy of territorial violence," cries out for more development (p. 263). While Briickner offers insights into some instances in which spatial consciousness and personal interiority are strikingly connected, his overall explanation for the introjection of a national imaginary into personal identity is more suggestive than complete. Ultimately, this is a book with many balls in the air, perhaps too many for the kind of satisfying and persuasive argumentation we commonly expect from a monograph. Yet it is also an exciting and provocative book. Bruickner's publishers are to be commended for supporting his extensive and illuminating footnotes, for including fifty-six illustrations so necessary to his arguments, and for producing an immediate paperback edition, which allows this book to get into the hands of scholars quickly. Bruickner offers us a rich and illumi- nating book, one that should stimulate other scholars to pursue, and perhaps contest, his findings. Sara Stidstone Gronim, Department of History, C.W.
