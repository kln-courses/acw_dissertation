<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rightlessness The Perplexities of Human Rights Alastair Hunt Portland State University Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this mon- strous tragic-comic scene , the most opposite passions necessarily succeed, and sometimes mix, with each other in the mind; alternate contempt and indigna- tion; alternate laughter and tears ; alternate scorn and horror. Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France At the time of writing (November 2010) legislative assemblies and voters in several of the United States have recently considered or are soon to consider bills and propositions known as "personhood bills" or "human rights amendments."1 On the face of it the proposed pieces of legislation are quite simple. They purport merely to determine the interpretation of the word "person," and sometimes the words "individual" and "human being," in CR: The New Centennial Review, Vol. 11, No. 2, 2012, pp. 115-142, ISSN 1532-687x. © Michigan State University Board of Trustees.

For example, the pro- posed amendment to the Colorado Constitutions Bill of Rights, defeated by voters in the November 2010 elections, reads as follows: "Person defined. As used in sections 3, 6, and 25 of Article II of the state constitution, the term person shall apply to every human being from the beginning of the biologi- cal development of that human being." Using a slightly different phrasing, the bill passed by the North Dakota House of Representatives on February 17, 2009- but defeated in the Senate the next month- asserts, "For purposes of interpretation of the constitution and laws of North Dakota, it is the intent of the legislative assembly that an individual, a person, when the context indicates that a reference to an individual is intended, or a human being includes any organism with the genome of homo sapiens."2 To most supporters of human rights these legislative efforts present something of a perplexing spectacle. Critics are no doubt absolutely correct to point out that this defense of the human rights of fetuses also consti- tutes an attack on the human rights of women. It is the explicit hope of the supporters of these efforts, including Personhood USA, a nonprofit, evan- gelical Christian, pro-life campaign group, that these unassuming acts of definitional clarification will render stem cell research, human cloning, and abortion illegal. "What supporters of this approach don t mention," writes Lynn M. Paltrow in an article published in The Huffington Post in March 2009, "is that if the unborn have legal personhood rights, pregnant women won t. There is really no way around this [I]f successful, this strategy will mean that upon becoming pregnant, women will lose their civil and human rights." Human beings, we might say, are born free and equal in rights. They are not, as Personhood USA maintains, "preborn" with rights. Proponents of the personhood bills and human rights amendments, however, seem to sincerely believe that theirs is a campaign in defense of human rights. Focusing exclusively on the reproductive rights of women, they contend, obscures what is really their basic point: human fetuses and even embryos are members of the human species and hence possess all the inalienable rights that attend such membership. If defending the right to abortion necessarily involves denying that human beings have an inalienable</page><page sequence="3">Alastair Hunt • 117 right to life from conception, simply by virtue of being biologically human, then it is this position that, to this wing of the pro-life movement, looks a lot like a violation of the rights of human beings. In this sense their use of the world's most famous animal rights philosopher, Peter Singer, to personify what they understand as an assault on human equality reveals a remark- able consistency.3 As efforts to legislate rights on the basis of the ethically relevant distinction between specifically human beings and all other beings, personhood bills, it could be said, are loyal to the very idea human rights presuppose. They merely aim to legally protect the rights of all those who are- or all that which is- genetically human by rigorously upholding what human rights discourse already states, namely, that being human is itself a claim to rights. How, then, do we respond to the question addressed to us on the websites of the various state chapters of Personhood USA: "Will you help establish humans rights for all?" (2008). The pro-life human rights project is a particularly striking example of the neoconservative mobilization of radical political discourse that began to flourish in the United States during the period of the Bush administration. To be sure, the clumsy insouciance with which its advocates claim that "preborn children" are the only group of human beings in the present United States who are systematically denied their human rights takes ones breath away.4 And yet if this deployment of human right discourse is, as Kristin Dombek puts it, "a way for conservatives to be liberal," to agitate for the rights of those deemed less than human, then dismissing it as a distortion of human rights overlooks the facility with which human rights discourse lends itself to the pro-life agenda (2010, 116). Perhaps the perplexities of the pro-life human rights campaign have something to teach us about the discourse that cur- rently provides the legal and normative terms in which all international politics and much domestic politics is conducted. Beginning in the years immediately after the United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), political theorist Han- nah Arendt spoke of "The Perplexities of the Rights of Man."5 Long recognized as an important political thinker, Arendts work has in more recent years become the common jumping-off point for a diverse range of efforts to renew the radical political potential of human rights.6 All of these projects</page><page sequence="4">118 • Rightlessness note that Arendt is intensely critical of human rights. On the far side of this critique, however, they all read in her work an affirmative account of human rights. Judith Butler compresses in miniature this pattern when she says that the two halves of the ninth chapter of The Origins of Totalitarianism adopt different voices. The first is "sardonic, skeptical, disillusioned,' ' whereas the second enters a "declarative mode." Butler concludes that Arendt effectively " redeclares the rights of man" (Butler and Spivak 2007, 47). This conclusion, however, overlooks the fact that what Arendt actually affirms is neither "human rights" nor "the rights of man," but rather "the right to have rights" (1973, 296). More to the point, this oversight is of a piece with the tendency to gloss over Arendt s critique of human rights to get to her supposed vindica- tion of them. It is this critical characterization of human rights that I want to take up in this essay because I think it helps us understand the perplexities presented by the pro-life movements human rights campaign. Arendts approach to human rights is compelling, I argue, because rather than viewing them as a set of rarefied philosophical ideas or strictly legisla- tive propositions, she attends to the acts by which human rights materialize in the real world. What she repeatedly draws our attention to is the aporetic distance so often apparent between the intentions behind these acts and the actual results. Her lesson is that the problem with human rights is not that the efforts of their advocates meet with overwhelming opposition or indifference from the powers that be. Rather the problem is that as a pro- gressive attempt to intervene in political life, human rights discourse itself produces the difficulty it encounters in establishing a clear-cut difference between the human beings that possess rights and the rest of the living in general that remains rightless. This difference is one that human rights necessarily presuppose: they are, after all, the rights of human beings.7 And yet as we will see, the acts by which the subject of rights materializes as human tend to undo the difference between the human and the nonhuman. Paradoxically insofar as human rights are located in being human as such, then human rights actually turn out to be a weird form of animal rights. Far from being merely laughable or lamentable, however, such a conclusion is, as we will see, actually hazardous for it reiterates the politicization of biology that has historically enabled mass atrocities. In saying this, I want</page><page sequence="5">Alastair Hunt • 119 to stress from the start that neither I nor Arendt, as I understand her, are simply against human rights. Human beings need rights. The effort of my argument is to help us understand why our efforts to practically realize a universal human rights have hitherto failed by showing how they turn upon a fundamental violence that closes off the subject to an ethical responsibil- ity to the other. Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Human Beings "Like a dog!" Franz Kafka, The Trial According to philosopher Jacques Maritain, a member of the Drafting Committee responsible for the UDHR, human rights are deducible "from the simple fact that man is man (1986, 63). For Maurice Cranston, "Human rights are . . . the rights that one has simply as a human being" (1973, 36). The statements of philosophers are confirmed in the young field of human rights historiography. "Thoughtful and insightful visionaries in many differ- ent times and places," writes Paul Gordon Lauren in the standard panoramic history of the topic, "have seen in their mind s eye a world in which all people might enjoy certain basic rights simply by virtue of being human' (2004, 1). In the words of another historian, Micheline Ishay, "Human rights are rights held by individuals simply because they are part of the human species" (2004, 3). What the philosophers and historians say is backed up by jurists and political scientists. For jurist Christian Tomaschut, "Human rights are rights which a person enjoys by virtue of being human, without any supplementary condition being required" (2004, 2-3). "If human rights are the rights one has simply because one is a human being, as they usually are thought to be," writes political scientist Jack Donnelly, "then they are held 'universally,' by all human beings" (2003, 1). In short, although very little else about human rights is simple, everyone agrees on one point: human rights are the rights that human beings possess "simply by virtue of being," "simply as," "simply</page><page sequence="6">120 • Rightlessness because they are" human beings. To possess human rights, one does not have to do anything, just be human. In light of such a universal consensus, Arendts position on human rights is conspicuously heterodox and might even seem wonderfully contrarian. For she maintains that when human beings are simply human beings, they are incapable of possessing any rights whatsoever. The sharpest and most compressed version of this claim comes in "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man," the ninth chapter of The Origins of To- talitarianism . "Equality, in contrast to all that is involved in mere existence," she writes, "is not given us, but is the result of human organization insofar as it is guided by the principle of justice. We are not born equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves mutually equal rights" (1973, 301). "We are not born equal" is, of course, a full-frontal contradiction of the first sentence of the first article of the UDHR proclaimed three years earlier: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."8 What Arendt takes issue with is not the assertion of political equality as such. No doubt, she strongly objected to the conformist, behaviorist social equality suffered under modern conditions (1998, 38-49). And yes, her portrait of politics as a matter of action stresses the "aristocratic" principle by which human beings, through opinions and deeds, distinguish themselves in the public sphere (48-49)- But unlike critics of human rights such as Edmund Burke, she held equality to be a supreme political principle. What she specifically objects to is the assump- tion within official human rights discourse that political equality material- izes in the natural life that appears at birth. "The very language" of human rights declarations, she says, "implies the belief in a kind of human 'nature which would be subject to the same laws of growth as that of the individual and from which rights and laws could be deduced" (1973, 298). For Arendt human beings can bear equal rights, but they do not do so simply by virtue of being born human. Arendts contradiction of the opening article of the UDHR at a range closer than point blank should in fact be read as a performative turning that demonstrates how the assertion that human beings are by birth politi- cally equal contradicts itself. She most convincingly explains this not in The</page><page sequence="7">Alastair Hunt • 121 Origins but in On Revolution ,9 when she observes, "The very idea of equality as we understand it, namely that every person is born as an equal by the very fact of being born and that equality is a birthright, was utterly unknown prior to the modern age" (1967, 30). Indeed, "inalienable political rights of all men by virtue of birth," she says, clearly agreeing with the belief she was reporting, "would have appeared to all ages prior to our own as ... a con- tradiction in terms" (36). It is a self-refuting proposition, because the book of nature contains no political instructions. Even the most egalitarian form of government theorized in ancient Greece understood political equality not as an organic growth from human nature but rather as the product of conventions that are by definition artificial. "Isonomy guaranteed equality, but not because all men were born or created equal, but, on the contrary, because men were by nature (cļruoei) not equal, and needed artificial institu- tions, the polis , which by virtue of its vojioç would make them equal The equality of the Greek polis , its isonomy, was an attribute of the polis and not of men, who received their equality by virtue of citizenship, not by virtue of birth" (21). Politically, birth is meaningless, and the hopeless attempt to found equality on the sheer fact of being born can only evince a misrecogni- tion of how politics actually works.10 Such a misrecognition was, Arendt argues, already apparent in the French Revolution, a revolution whose signature document, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, was proclaimed by the National As- sembly in 1789. The revolutionaries understood themselves to be tearing off the mask of hypocrisy from the natural face of "the people." What they were actually doing, as Edmund Burke among others incisively recognized, was destroying the persona through which human beings appeared as politi- cal.11 In ancient Greek theater, the mask actors wore to perform a role was called a persona. In ancient Rome "the word persona became a metaphor and was carried from the language of the theatre into legal terminology. The distinction between a private individual in Rome and a Roman citizen was that the latter had a persona , a legal personality, as we would say; it was as though the law had affixed to him the part he was expected to play on the public sphere . . ." (Arendt 1967, 97). The tragedy of the French Revolution, however, is that its actors "had no conception of the persona , and no respect</page><page sequence="8">122 • Rightlessness for the legal personality which is given and guaranteed by the body politic" (98). What the authors of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen failed to understand, then, is that the subject of rights appears only in the substitution of an artificial mask for a natural face. "They believed that they had emancipated nature herself, as it were, liberated the natural man in all men, and given him the Rights of Man to which each was entitled, not by virtue of the body politic to which he belonged, but by virtue of being born." However, "they had, albeit unknowingly, torn away the mask of the persona as well, so that the Reign of Terror eventually spelled the exact opposite of true liberation and true equality; it equalized because it left all inhabitants equally without the protecting mask of a legal personality" (98). In short, what the French conception of human rights as entitlements given in the nakedness of birth fails to appreciate is that individuals claim and exercise rights through the figurai process of appearing before the law as a subject.12 The consequences of this self-contradiction within human rights dis- course, Arendt argues in "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man," were given an especially painfiil practical demonstration in the fate suffered by ever increasing numbers of minorities and stateless peoples produced in the years after World War One. Both groups were un- intentionally but effectively left without the protection of any government willing and able to enforce their rights. As a result, they were exposed to the vicissitudes of unregulated, extra-legal violence. Now, because human rights are supposedly the rights one possesses not because one is a citizen of a nation-state, but rather simply because one is a human being, then human rights are, according to conventional wisdom, designed to help such people in such a situation. If a human being loses his political status, he should, according to the impli- cation of the inborn and inalienable rights of man, come under exactly the situation for which the declarations of such general rights provided. Actually the opposite is the case. It seems that a man who is nothing but a man has lost the very qualities which make it possible for other people to treat him as a fellow-man. (1973, 300)</page><page sequence="9">Alastair Hunt • 123 The aporia here is that the violation of human rights does not take the form of a calling into question or denial of one's humanity, but rather temporally coincides with being recognized as a human being. Hence Arendt repeatedly emphasizes that human rights fail to do what we intend them to do. Human rights might have "been defined as 'inalien- able because they were supposed to be independent of all governments; but it turned out that the moment human beings lacked their own government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them and no institution was willing to guarantee them" (1973, 291-92; emphasis mine). Again: The paradox involved in the loss of human rights is that such a loss coincides with the instant when a person becomes a human being in general- without a profession, without a citizenship, without an opinion, without a deed by which to identify and specify himself- and different in general, represent- ing nothing but his own absolutely unique individuality which, deprived of expression within and action upon a common world, loses all significance. (1973» 302; first emphasis mine) Again: The conception of human rights, based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such, broke down at the very moment when those who pro- fessed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships- except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human. (1973, 299; emphasis mine) What produces the distance between the intention behind assertions of human rights and the practical results of these assertions is the "nakedness" of the human being said to possess rights simply by virtue of being human. (The full elaboration of Arendt s phrase is "the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human" [1973, 297, 300].) That one referent of Arendts figure is the inhabitant of the fictional state of nature dear to modern political theorists</page><page sequence="10">124# Rightlessness as diverse as Hobbes and Rousseau is clear when she says that the rightless human beings produced in increasing numbers after World War One are "thrown back into a peculiar state of nature" (300). And yet the nakedness of these human beings is in Arendt s sense not, as traditional connotations might suggest, an uncorrupted, originary condition from which a vindica- tion of political legitimacy is derived. Such people are indeed innocent, but only in the sense that nothing they said or did had any meaning. Their "very innocence- from every point of view and especially that of the persecut- ing government- was their greatest misfortune. Innocence, in the sense of complete lack of responsibility, was the mark of their rightlessness as it was the seal of the loss of political status" (295).13 There is, thus, nothing Edenic or paradisiacal about the naked life of those who live in the modern state of na- ture. Indeed the nakedness of human beings who live in this state of nature is a politically privative condition, for it is the unprotected and vulnerable form of existence left over once one is deprived of the mask of legal personality and the clothes of citizenship. Such human beings are nothing but human being and less than citizens, precisely because they are destitute of the legal per- sonality that renders individuals intelligible and recognizable by the law of a particular nation-state. The "naked fact of our original physical appearance" that Arendt says birth introduces is, by definition, a fact of nature rather than a political act (1998, 176-77). It is of the order of physis rather than nomos or techne. No one is born fully clothed. What alienates human beings from their supposedly "inalienable" human rights is being human itself. Being human is not the sufficient condition of possessing rights. It is a natural condition fundamentally alien to politics. "[The rights of man] were meant to spell out primary positive rights, inherent in mans nature, as distinguished from his political status, and as such they tried to reduce politics to nature" (1967, 99). Thus, Arendt writes laconically, "And it is interesting to note that the Latin word homo , the equivalent of man,' signified originally somebody who was nothing but a man, a rightless person, therefore, and a slave" (36).14 It is in this sense that we should understand Arendts claim that " [t] he very phrase 'human rights became for all concerned - victims, persecutors, on- lookers alike- the evidence of hopeless idealism or fumbling feeble-minded hypocrisy" (1973, 269). For even human beings who are utterly rightless are</page><page sequence="11">Alastair Hunt • 125 able to see the stupidity of those who advocate human rights. Demands by the rightless to have their national citizenship recognized demonstrate, she says, that even they understand how the abstract nakedness of being human bestializes those it is said to protect. The survivors of the extermination camps, the inmates of concentration and internment camps, and even the comparatively happy stateless people could see . . . that the abstract nakedness of being human and nothing but human was their greatest danger. Because of it they were regarded as savages and, afraid that they might end by being considered beasts, they insisted on their nationality, the last sign of their former citizenship, as their only remaining and recognized tie with humanity. (1973, 300) If the understanding attributed to the rightless underscores the stupidity of those who champion human rights from the safety of their citizenship, then it does little, however, to compensate the rightless for their practical victimization. There are, according to Arendt, two options by which a rightless person can hope to be a "recognized exception" deserving of the attention and pro- tection of the law rather than merely an 4 unrecognized anomaly." The first is to commit a crime. "Only as an offender against the law," she writes with cutting irony, "can he gain protection from it" (1973, 286). The second op- tion is "to become a genius." "Only fame will eventually answer the repeated complaint of all refugees of all social strata that nobody here knows who I am; it is true that the chances of the famous refugee are improved just as a dog with a name has a better chance to survive than a stray dog who is just a dog in general" (1973, 287). Arendts miniature fable likens a stray dog to a refugee who is one of the "huge and nameless" crowd of refugees; and a dog with a name to a refugee who distinguishes herself through being famous in some way. The salient difference is that the fame or name of the latter might single them out from the anonymous crowd. I say "might" rather than "will" because fame does not in and of itself make anyone a citizen of a nation- state. What's at issue is survival, not political action, and being a famous personality is not recognition as a legal personality. More to the point, by</page><page sequence="12">126 0 Rightlessness the terms of Arendts analogy all refugees are dogs- even the refugee who is a recognized genius. As domesticated rather than wild animals dogs do not live in a pure state of nature outside and beyond the reach of law. Yet even when they are domestic animals with names, rather than stray animals that get picked up by animal control and euthanized at an animal shelter, all dogs are in principle not members of any political community. Even when they are "fed by some state or private welfare agency" such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, this does not change "in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the na- tions to feed them . . ." (1973, 296). The distinction between humanitarianism and animal welfare blurs when both are distinct from efforts to secure the legal recognition of rights and even share a fundamental complicity with the conditions that produce rightlessness. In this light one of Arendt s seemingly off-hand witticisms in the ninth chapter of The Origins of Totalitarianism gains an unsuspected significance. Even worse was that all societies formed for the protection of the Rights of Man, all attempts to arrive at a new bill of human rights, were sponsored by marginal figures- by a few international jurists without political experience or professional philanthropists supported by the uncertain sentiments of professional idealists. The groups they formed, the declarations they issued, showed an uncanny similarity in language and composition to that of societ- ies for the prevention of cruelty to animals. (1973» 292) An exemplary instance of Arendt s characteristic mode of humor- biting, wry, and tough - the comparison of human rights groups to animal welfare groups economically captures her recognition that the founding document of international human rights law, in its assertion that human beings are born with rights, conceives of human beings as living animals. The abstract nakedness of being human is, after all, a biological form of being that human beings share with all other animals. Human rights advocates might think they are fighting practices in which human beings are treated like animals, and animal rights advocates, such as Peter Singer, might often characterize</page><page sequence="13">Alastair Hunt • 127 the call for a radical transformation of humanist speciesism as an extension of campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities, gay and lesbian minorities, women, and so on. For Arendt, however, human rights are already a form of animal rights. The point made by some of her closest readers, such as Giorgio Agamben, that human rights are a form of humanitarianism can thus be given a sharper formulation (1998, 133-34). Given that the subject who is said to bear human rights is not a human being at all, but rather an animal, human rights are not merely an exercise in humanitarian assistance; they are a campaign to prevent cruelty to a species of animals. The problem with human rights is, thus, not that the efforts of human rights advocates meet with overwhelming indifference or opposition from the powers that be. Rather the problem is that as an attempt to intervene in political life human rights are self-defeating. The assertion that human be- ings possess rights by virtue of being human founds rights upon the abstract nakedness of being human. And yet this naked existence is by definition not something that can make a politically intelligible rights claim. Human rights are, thus, a trap posing as a shelter. In vindicating rights on the natural fact of being human, they unwittingly premise politics on the very nakedness that leads to the loss of human rights. It is not the denial of birthrights that results in the violation of rights. Rather the very assertion that human beings are born free and equal in rights throws them into a state of nature from which no particular political community will claim them and from which they cannot claim rights on the basis of membership in a particular community. Assuming that rights are hard-wired into one s natural existence as a human being misrecognizes that politics takes form as the artifice of speaking and acting as a member of an organized community, for example, as a citizen of a nation-state- something quite different from being a member of a biological species. This biologistic assumption not only removes human beings from the concrete, artificial circumstances that give reality to political communities, but it also abandons them to an animal ontology in principle disarticulated from the conditions of ethical responsibility and political action.</page><page sequence="14">128* Rightlessness The Rights of the Human Race The calling into question of our quality as men provokes an almost biological claim of belonging to the human race. Robert Antelme, The Human Species So far I have argued that for Arendt human rights are best viewed as a form of animal rights, because they conceive of human beings possessing rights in their naked life. As a political proposition, then, human rights are pro- grammed to fail in the face of, and thus in some manner to be complicit with, mass atrocity.15 And yet part two of The Origins of Totalitarianism also suggests that it is not only the failure of human rights that we should be wary of; human rights would also be complicit with political violence even if they were to be universally enforced with success. If we take seriously the politicization of birth in the UDHR, then human rights are attempts to "reduce politics to nature" in a sense that is more disturbing than merely being a form of animal protection. In fact, the effacement of the specific difference between the human and the animal can also be read as a sign that human rights participate in the very biopolitical logic of racism to which we understand them to be opposed. Being human is not merely politically meaningless; it is actually a dangerous biopolitical proposition. Arendt raises the question of racism in "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man" in the paragraphs following her declara- tion, "We are not born equal." If a Negro in a white community is considered a Negro and nothing else, he loses along with his right to equality that freedom of action which is specifically human; all his deeds are now explained as "necessary" consequences of some "Negro" qualities; he has become some specimen of an animal species, called man. Much the same thing happens to those who have lost all distinctive political qualities and have become human beings and nothing else lhe great danger arising from the existence of people forced to live out- side the common world is that they are thrown back, in the midst of civiliza- tion, on their natural givenness, on their mere differentiation. They lack that</page><page sequence="15">Alastair Hunt • 129 tremendous equalizing of differences which comes from being citizens of some commonwealth and yet, since they are no longer allowed to partake in the human artifice, they begin to belong to the human race in much the same way as animals belong to a specific animal species. (1973, 301-2) It might seem strange to say, as Arendt does, that a racial other is an exem- plary specimen of the human species, because one would normally think that such a person has their humanity called into question. Note, however, that she characterizes the human species as "an animal species." Both some- one "considered a Negro and nothing else" and those who "have become human beings and nothing else" belong to the human species in the way an animal belongs to an animal species, namely, not by virtue of doing anything politically meaningful- something by which they can be judged- but rather simply by virtue of being born. Arendt elaborates on the difference in an in- terview with Günter Gaus: "In the first place, belonging to a group is a natural condition. You belong to some sort of group when you are born, always. But to belong to a group in the way you mean, in the second sense, that is, to join or form an organized group, is something completely different. This kind of organization has to do with a relation to the world" (Arendt 1994, 17). Those who are nothing but members of their race or species by virtue of being born into these groups lack this relation to the world, understood as the organized space in which actors appear to each other by virtue of their actions. In this way racism exemplifies the sort of ideology that violates human rights by reducing racial others to a biologistic ontology discontinuous with the ca- pacity for political action Arendt regards as properly human.16 There is, however, something profoundly disorienting in the fact that Arendts terms for describing those reduced to being "a Negro and nothing else" and those who "have become human beings and nothing else" resem- ble nothing else but "the abstract nakedness of being human and nothing but human" upon which human rights are premised. We begin to grasp the coherence of this disorientation when we remember that the principal concern of part two of The Origins of Totalitarianism , of which "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man" is the final chapter, is the ideology of racism that subtended European imperialism and that</page><page sequence="16">130 • Rightlessness eventually became one of the historical elements out of which totalitarian- ism was made possible. Parts of Arendts account of racism are fairly conventional and can be telegraphically stated. Racism, she says, found its first possibility in the "race- thinking" that emerged in Europe during the eighteenth century. Although race-thinking took very different forms in France, Germany, and England, in all cases it proposed to subdivide the human species into groups based upon characteristics inherent in the essence of each group. Race-thinking became racism proper in the nineteenth century when it turned into an ideology, that is, a system of broad popular belief based on one idea understood to be the key to negotiating the vicissitudes of experience. What is especially distinctive about Arendts account of racism is her portrayal of it as a substitute for a genuinely political form of community. In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Germany, for example, race was substi- tuted for nationality as the fundamental unit of community. Out of the failure to raise the people to nationhood, out of the lack of com- mon historical memories and the apparent popular apathy to common destinies in the future, a naturalistic appeal was born which addressed itself to tribal instincts as a possible substitute for what the whole world had seen to the be the glorious power of French nationhood. The organic doctrine of a history for which "every race is a separate, complete whole" was invented by men who needed ideological definitions of national unity as a substitute for political nationhood. (1973, 166) The irony of this substitution is that at the very moment it produces hier- archical distinctions between superior and inferior races, it also locates all races on an equally biologistic level. Arendt explains the point by means of another animal fable: [N]o matter how exalted the claim for ones own people, peoples are trans- formed into animal species so that a Russian appears as different from a German as a wolf is from a fox. A "divine people" lives in a world in which it is the born persecutor of all other weaker species, or the born victim of all</page><page sequence="17">Alastair Hunt • 131 other stronger species. Only the rules of the animal kingdom can possibly apply to its political destinies. (1973, 234-35) If racism figures human races as animal species, then the difference between a superior race and an inferior race is, like the difference between two species of animals, not much of a difference at all.17 In the ninth chapter of The Origins , Arendt dilates on this irony in a de- scription of slavery. Slavery's fundamental offense against human rights was not that it took lib- erty away (which can happen in many other situations), but that it excluded a certain category of people even from the possibility of fighting for freedom- a fight possible under tyranny, and even under the desperate conditions of modern terror (but not under any conditions of concentration-camp life). Slavery's crime against humanity did not begin when one people defeated and enslaved its enemies (though of course that was bad enough), but when slavery became an institution in which some men were "born" free and others slave, when it was forgotten that it was man who had deprived his fellow-men of freedom, and when the sanction for the crime was attributed to nature" (i973. 297). Arendts straightforward emphasis here is on the way an ideology can get away with regarding some human beings as "born" slave by framing nature for the crime. Natural slaves are produced through the sleight of hand of committing a crime, then saying, "Nature did it!" In this way an ideological artifice is passed off as a fact of nature. Arendt s more intriguing suggestion, however, is that such an ideology does not merely assert that some people are born slave but also that others are born free. lhe difference between being born slave and born free and equal in rights is, of course, impossible to overemphasize. In the latter case one is born into the position in which one can participate in political community, whereas in the former one is born into a position by definition excluded from this possibility. But both are biological births as flesh and blood organisms that get figured as political births into disparate positions within a community. "Born free' is, moreover,</page><page sequence="18">132 • Rightlessness also a citation of part of the first article of the UDHR: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." What is a central phrase of human rights discourse doing in a description of racism? There is, no doubt, a world of difference between racism and human rights: the former asserts that some human beings are born free and oth- ers are born slave, whereas the latter claims that all human beings are born and none are born slave. At one point during the UDHR Drafting Committee discussions about whether or not the first article should use the verb "are born," the delegation from Syria "felt that the word 'borri should be retained as it would exclude the idea of hereditary slavery" (Lindholm 1992, 48). And yet just as both the victims and beneficiaries of racist ideology are unnatural products of the same artifice, so human rights, in claiming that human be- ings are born free and equal in rights, mobilizes the same biologistic logic evident in racism. In presenting arrangements that are the "result of action" as things "given in the nature of things," human rights turn upon the substitu- tion of biology for politics. Being "born free and equal in rights" is, after all, nothing if not a political achievement "attributed to nature." The principal assertion of human rights, that rights inhere in the abstract nakedness of being human, relies upon a framing of nature for an act that is actually com- mitted by human beings. In this sense both the beneficiary of racist ideology and the beneficiary of human rights can be referred to as specimens of "an animal species, called man." Understanding that human rights, like racism, rely upon biologism throws into question our conventional belief that the defense of human rights constitutes an answer to racism. Consider the role of the biological sciences in the production of human rights discourse after World War Two. It was a common belief in the late 1940s and early 1950s that the life sciences before and during the war had been complicit in producing racial hierarchies that served as the basis of political projects pursuing racist agendas. So it was thought that the appropriate thing to do was for the life sciences to an- nounce that there is no scientific basis for racism and to affirm the scientific basis of human equality. This announcement took the form of four state- ments on race published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) between 1950 and 1967. According to the</page><page sequence="19">Alastair Hunt • 133 1964 Proposal on the Biological Aspects of Race, "Racist theories can in no way pretend to have any scientific foundation, and anthropologists should endeavour to prevent the results of their researches from being used in such a biased way that they would serve non-scientific ends." This sentence is itself, however, an instance of science being utilized for nonscientific ends. The entire document intends the biological concept of the human species to serve the political ends of human rights as announced in the UDHR. In the same moment that racism is denounced, then, the political equality of all members of the human species is being affirmed on the same site as racist science asserted the political inequality of human races, namely a biological definition of the human species. The first article of the UNESCO Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice of 1978 couldrit be more explicit about this: "All human beings belong to a single species and are descended from a common stock. They are born equal in dignity and rights and all form an integral part of humanity." The antagonism between racism and human rights occurs on the basis of their fundamental agreement that politics takes its orientation from a biological definition of the human race. Although this aporia does not efface all differences between human rights and racism, it does render them formally indistinguishable. If human rights, like racism, politicize biology, the important difference between them is that, whereas racism contends that only some human beings are born free and equal in rights, human rights claim that all human beings are born thus. Yet this is also to say that only human beings are born free and equal in rights. Like races, species necessarily come in multiples, appear only by virtue of a caesura or a cut within the living in general. As a political project to protect the rights of human beings, human rights do nothing for the liv- ing in general outside the human species. Far from denying all biopolitical hierarchy, human rights displace it from the level of race to that of species. In short, insofar as the flip side of human equality is human exceptionalism, or more pointedly speciesism, then declarations of human rights are also declarations of nonhuman rightlessness.18 If this sounds incredible, then consider that the very real difficulty we have in believing- or even hearing it said- that human rights silently efface the claims of nonhuman beings, parallels the equal difficulty racists have in</page><page sequence="20">134# Rightlessness hearing the speech of members of "inferior races" as anything other than animal noises. The difficulty we have in appreciating that the taxon of species organizes political community in this way is a measure of the extent to which we think the simple opposition between human beings and nonhuman be- ings is a given on which politics proceeds. And if the exclusion by human rights of nonhuman beings from political community seems fundamentally different from the racist exclusion of human beings from the community of equals, then remember that racism has no trouble in presenting itself as a coherent humanism - the humanism of the real human beings. Indeed, the nineteenth-century form of racial theory known as polygenism claimed that the different human races were in fact different- and not at all politi- cally equal- human species. All of these difficulties are concentrated in the phrase "the human race," which can refer both to the human species and to a privileged subgroup of the human species.19 Declarations of Rightlessness In Our Posthuman Future : Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution, Francis Fukuyama worries about how the unregulated development of bio- technology is likely to enable us to fabricate ethico-political hierarchies that are naturally given in human genetics. Toward the very end of his life, Thomas Jefferson wrote, "The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God." The political equality enshrined in the Declaration of Independence rests on the empirical fact of natural human equality. . . . The ultimate question raised by biotechnology is, What will happen to political rights once we are able to, in effect, breed some people with saddles on their backs, and others with boots and spurs? (2002, 9-10) What is striking about this passage is the way Fukuyama literalizes the metaphorical logic behind confusion of the biological and the political</page><page sequence="21">Alastair Hunt • 135 within human rights discourse. His metaphors of human beings geneti- cally engineered to be either horses or riders, with technologies of power ("saddles," "boots and spurs") indistinguishable from their biological lives, literalize what is already a genetic logic.20 So if he fears, with considerable justification, that the biotechnological production of differences within the human species at a genetic level would be taken to legitimate inequality within the human species at a political level, what he does not see is that human rights already rely upon such fabricated natural hierarchies. That human rights are already a political form of biotechnology is plain in the assertively naturalistic model of human rights Fukuyama articulates in the whole of the later seventh chapter of his book. Human rights, he tells us, demand to be understood in such a way as to render them a bul- wark against pernicious uses of biotechnology. Such rights are grounded in human nature, and the modern life sciences give us a clear picture of human nature. Just as the human species is genetically one, so all human beings are politically equal. The potential problem with biotechnology is that it introduces difference at a natural level that spoils the naked equality of the human species. In potentially undoing the identity of the human spe- cies and equal rights, biotechnology allows us to mistake human beings for animals. And yet if biotechnology renders contingent the relation between being human and bearing equal rights, this is because this contingency is already there in human rights. Fukuyamas own model of human rights performs the naturalization of ethico-political difference that he fears is a consequence of biotechnology. His solution to the problem of biotechnology is itself another iteration of the problem. This aporia is precisely what we see in the pro-life mobilization of human rights discourse to legislate the human rights of all organisms with a human genome. Such a project is indeed an opportunistic cooption of human rights discourse for an agenda that would actually violate human rights, but only insofar as its confusion of being biologically human and bearing rights is a faithful iteration of, rather than a distortion of, a central gesture of human rights. As we have seen, this confusion of biology and ethico-political entitle- ment is hidden in plain sight in the first article of the UDHR: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." Of course, saying human</page><page sequence="22">136# Rightlessness beings are "born' with rights is not the same as saying they are "p reborn" with rights. And the committee responsible for drafting the UDHR was not unaware of this distinction. The delegations from both Venezuela and Mexico objected to the emphasis on birth in the first article of the document. In the words of Pedro de Alba of Mexico, "a human being's right to freedom and equality began from the moment of his conception and continued after his birth."21 The conflict between birthrights and pre-birthrights is particularly manifest when a single body serves as the site of competing rights claims- the right to life and the right to abortion. And yet this disagreement con- cerning birthrights and pre-birthrights takes place upon the site of a prior agreement that being biologically human comes with rights already built into it. Whether one maintains that human beings are born with rights or that they are preborn with them, Arendt helps us see that both claims turn on a metaphorical logic by which rights inhere in the biology of human beings. In both cases the fiction involved is that the human genome itself voices a rights claim, that the human genome is a subject of rights.22 It is here, in the ways the biologistic denial of the difference between ontology and rights disarticulates us from de facto predicaments of ethical responsibility and political action, that we must begin to think beyond human rights, and thus further into the perplexities of rights.23 NOTES Thank you to Michelle Niemann for drawing my attention to the pro-life human rights project. I also want to thank the organizers and participants of two forums where I first tested parts of the argument this paper makes: "Pets and Meat," a special session organized by Ron Broglio at Romantic Meditations, the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism Conference, in Vancouver, B.C., August 2010; and "What is Posthumanism?," a panel discussion at the "Beyond Human" symposium organized by the Center for Humanities at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, March 2009. 1. Pro-life personhood bills or human rights amendments have been initiated in the following states Alabama (2010), California (2010), Colorado (2008, 2010), Florida (2010), Georgia (2007 onward), Maryland (2009), Michigan (2010), Missouri (2010),</page><page sequence="23">Alastair Hunt • 137 Mississippi (2010), Montana (2010), Nevada (2010), North Dakota (2009), Oregon (2008), South Carolina (2009), and Virginia (2010). 2. Combining both types of phrasing, the current federal human rights amendment proposed by the American Life League- several have been proposed since 1975- is perhaps the most comprehensive. Section 2 reads, "With respect to the right to life guaranteed to persons by the fifth and fourteenth articles of amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the word person applies to all human beings; irrespective of age, health, function, physical or mental ability, disability, dependence or method of reproduction; from the beginning of their biological development as human beings (i.e., as human organisms)." Among the definitions offered in section 4, we find the following: "Human being: Any organism, including the single-cell human embryo, irrespective of the method of reproduction, who possesses a genome specific for and consistent with an individual member of the human species." 3. See Keith Masons blog post on the Personhood USA website entitled "Why Can t We Have an Honest Debate?" (2009): "Singer thus argues that apes, gorillas, monkeys, dogs, chickens, pigs, etc., are persons because they do actively exercise rational attributes and sentience- while adult human beings such as the comatose, the frail elderly, the mentally retarded, the mentally ill, drug addicts, alcoholics, paraplegics, etc., are not persons'- and therefore they do not have the same moral and legal rights and protections as real persons' Is this the opinion of Planned Parenthood, NARAL, N.O.W., and those who are opposed to affirming the personhood of all humans?" There's certainly a bit a prestidigitation involved in Mason's use of Singer to represent the prochoice position on the personhood of fetuses and in his explication of Singer's views. Yet he has a point when he suggests that supporters of abortion share a certain common ground with supporters of animal rights. The portrayal of babies as laboratory animals in the antiabortion film Whatever Happened to the Human Race? is a good example of the pro-life claim that abortion necessarily requires mistaking human beings for animals. As Kristin Dombek (2010) and Penelope Deutscher (2007) point out in different ways, the pro-life position illuminates the complexities of the contemporary politics of life known as "biopolitics." 4. So too does their effort to liken the exercise of reproductive rights to the indigenous American experience of colonialism, to African-American experience of slavery and racism, and to the Jewish experience of the Holocaust. See "What is Personhood?" (2008) and a blog post by Keith Mason entitled "Holocaust Survivor Supported Personhood Bill" (2010), both published on the Personhood USA website. 5. The phrase is the title of the second section of "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man," chapter nine of The Origins of Totalitarianism (1973). Arendt published an early version of part of this chapter in an article that appeared one year after the UDHR entitled in English "The Rights of Man: What Are They?" and in German "There is Only One Human Right" (Es gibt nur ein Einzeges Menschenrcht). As Christophe Menke (2007) notes, the challenge in understanding Arendts view of human rights is usefully suggested by the distance that unites the two very different titles to the same text.</page><page sequence="24">138 • Rightlessness 6. "Hannah Arendt is perhaps the most widely studied political philosopher of the twentieth century," wrote Jeffrey C. Isaac in 1998. "And yet little attention is paid to her views on human rights" (74). Since that time, others have begun to champion Arendts account of human rights. Peg Birmingham (2006) and Serena Parekh (2008) have both devoted book-length studies to close, careful, and extensive consideration of Arendt s account of human rights. Outside of the field of Arendt studies strictly defined, her work also serves as the starting point for original interventions by Claude Lefort (1986, 1988), Giorgio Agamben (1998), Jean-François Lyotard (1994), Jacques Rancière (2004), Werner Hamacher (2004, 2006), Christoph Menke (2007), Thomas Keenan (1997), and Étienne Balibar (1994b, 2007). 7. That human rights are rights of the specifically human is something that barely gets recognized, let alone thought through, in discussions of human rights. The exceptions are Luc Ferry (1995) and Wesley J. Smith (2010), who both argue for a humanism regarding rights that can only be described as unapologetic. 8. As is well known, the figure of birth here reiterates that of the first article of the French National Assembly's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789 ("Men are born and remain free and equal in rights"), which itself paraphrases the opening sentence of part one of Rousseau's The Social Contract ("Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains"). 9. In The Origins, Arendt does little more than suggest that neither human nature nor nonhuman nature can provide a foundation for political community. For example: "How should one be able to deduce laws and rights from a universe which apparently knows neither the one nor the other category?" (1973, 298). In The Human Condition (1998), she goes further and argues that we are structurally incapable of knowing human nature. 10. Arendt formalizes her distinction between nature and politics in The Human Condition (1998). 11. Arendt approvingly cites the opinion of Edmund Burke, the most influential eighteenth- century critic of human rights: "These facts and reflections offer what seems an ironical, bitter, and belated confirmation of the famous arguments with which Edmund Burke opposed the French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man. They appear to buttress his assertion that human rights were an abstraction,' that it was much wiser to rely on an entailed inheritance of rights . . . and to claim one's rights to be the 'rights of an Englishman' rather than the inalienable rights of man" (1973. 299). 12. Cf. "Without his persona , there would be an individual without rights and duties, perhaps a natural man -that is, a human being or homo in the original meaning of the word, indicating someone outside the range of the law and the body politic of the citizens, as for instance a slave- but certainly a politically irrelevant person" (1967, 97). Arendts understanding of the political importance of persona finds an incisive elaboration in Barbara Johnson's examination of personification and anthropomorphism in poetry and the law (Johnson 2001). 13. Of her own experience as a stateless person, Arendt once said, Nevertheless, in the end I did not leave in such a peaceful way. And I must say that gives me a certain</page><page sequence="25">Alastair Hunt • 139 satisfaction. I was arrested, and had to leave the country illegally- I will tell you how in a minute- and that was instant gratification for me. I thought at least I had done something! At least I am not 'innocent.' No one could say that of me!" (1994, 5). 14. "There are two good reasons why philosophy has never found a place where politics can take shape. The first is the assumption that there is something political in man that belongs to his essence. This is simply not so; man is apolitical" (Arendt 2005, 95). 15. "It is clear," writes Peg Birmingham in Hannah Arendt and Human Rights, "that Arendt places the responsibility for the death camps squarely at the feet of a philosophically invalid and politically impotent notion of human rights" (2006, 5). Although I am not so sure Arendt ever blames human rights for any mass atrocity, Birmingham is undoubtedly correct to say that Arendt sees human rights as practically effete to stop mass atrocity. 16. In the terms developed in The Human Condition, Arendt would say that the racial other s "actions," which also contain an element of spontaneity, are regarded as and possibly come to be mere "behavior," the result of mere necessity (1998, 205, 246). 17. Arendt offers another version of this claim in a portion of chapter six of The Origins on English racism titled "The 'Rights of Englishmen vs. the Rights of Men": "[Darwinism] also started from the principle of inheritance but added to it the political principle of the nineteenth century, progress, whence it arrived at the opposite but far more convincing conclusion that man is related not only to man but to animal life, that the existence of lower races shows clearly that gradual differences alone separate man and beast and that a powerful struggle for existence dominates all living things" (1973, 178). 18. Donna J. Haraway and Wesley J. Smith use the term "human exceptionalism" (Haraway, 2007). 19. My contention here develops an implication of Balibars argument about the way any definition of the human species- whether racist or speciesist- cannot help but reflect the difference between the human and the animal within the human species, so that some human beings are more human than others (1991, 1994a). 20. Arendt anticipates Fukuyamas worry in her claim that totalitarianism builds upon racism's confusion of nature and politics by trying to "make mankind." Just as racism substitutes race for nation, so totalitarianism substitutes making for acting. The difference is that racism simply accepts what is given, whereas totalitarianism tries to make society conform to a political vision of nature. For example, the eugenic improvement of the stock of the population and the extermination of threats to (rather than enemies of) that population both actively try to realize at an artificial level the norms racism discerns as given in nature. See "Ideology and Terror," the final chapter of the revised edition of The Origins (1973). 21. As Johannes Morsink explains in a detailed study of the UDHR, "Some delegations [on the Drafting Committee] used the word 'birth' to refer to physical births as flesh and blood creatures, while others used it to refer to a double birth, a physical birth that is accompanied by a moral birth into the human family of rights and duties And although they did not say when this moral rider attached itself to the physical process- a question that did interest some of the Latin delegations concerned with</page><page sequence="26">140 • Rightlessness abortion rights- that large majority of the drafters thought that such a moral birth did take place when a new human being was born into the human family" (1999, 291-92). 22. If this seems like a fantasy far removed from the sober and solemn realism of international human rights law, then consider how easily it could be maintained that the pro-life human rights campaign is only literalizing the relation between biology and rights asserted in the first article of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights of 1997: "The human genome underlies the fundamental unity of all members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diversity. In a symbolic sense, it is the heritage of humanity." 23. In the course of her critique of human rights in the ninth chapter of The Origins, Arendt talks enigmatically of "the right to have rights." Although she never returned to this phrase in any of her subsequent writings, others have recently turned to it as a way to revitalize and radicalize human rights. I try to read its perplexities in a companion essay to the present one, "The Right to Have Rights." REFERENCES Agamben, Giorgio. 1998. Homo Sacer : Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans.
