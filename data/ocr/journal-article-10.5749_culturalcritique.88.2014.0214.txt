Mitchell posits that pic- tures “present not just a surface, but a face that faces the beholder” (72).  While this seeming personiWcation of nonliving objects entails the famil- iar risks of backwardness, including fetishism and idolatry, neither  iconoclastic critique nor a taxonomy of healthy and perverse, progres- sive and regressive images/objects has the capacity to make fetishism  disappear. The political task of the cultural critic in such circumstances  is the reverse of straightforward; an understanding of the relationship  between cultural forms and political practices needs to be not so much  diagnostic as much as an endeavor to understand and engage the mag- ical residue that clings stubbornly to visual (and other) objects. Mitch- ell’s provocation has had wide purchase among art historians and  among historians and theorists of media and visual culture. It is worth  noting its special salience for any consideration of the public culture  of the subcontinent, which has come to invest popular prints of deities  as well as public monuments (especially but not exclusively temples  and mosques) with the politics of Hindu rightist nationalism. Of the  works broadly inspired by Mitchell, two texts published in the last  decade have been widely inXuential in turn: Christopher Pinney’s “Pho- tos of the Gods”: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India (2004)  and Kajri Jain’s Gods in the Bazaar: The Economies of Indian Calendar Art  (2007). For Pinney, the popular chromolithographs he examines encom- pass not just the visual artifact but also the social and visual affect of  visual and material objects. He names this dynamic social relationship  Cultural Critique 88—Fall 2014—Copyright 2014 Regents of the University of Minnesota </page> <page sequence="2"> Book Reviews 215 of viewer and viewed a “corpothetics”—a somatic and performative  engagement with sacred and secular images. This visual Weld, includ- ing its human networks of production, consumption, and circulation,  must be read, he insists, as crucial to the shaping of a public culture in  the subcontinent; it is not merely a sphere of application, replicating  an ideological content produced in orbits recognized as more properly  political or historical. “Is it possible,” he asks, “to envisage history as  in part determined by struggles occurring at the level of the visual?”  (8). Such a conception of the work that the image does should make us  wary of a realist idiom predicated on a mistrust both of images and  the commodity form and an understanding of viewers as lacking the  capacity to resist their lure. “The default mode of critical thinking about  the role of images in social and political change has tended to be a  juridical one,” says Jain, pointing out how this tends often to slight the  complex ways in which images function (10). Bishnupriya Ghosh’s Global Icons must be situated within this im-  portant conversation, which she reenergizes and extends in ambitious  ways. More than an examination of visual culture alone, it stakes out  the imaginative practices and the political possibilities of mass media  in a globalized and neoliberal contemporaneity. Focusing on three con- tested female Wgures she calls “bio-icons,” she seeks to investigate the  ways in which they function, not so much as charismatic leaders of  movements or like traditional stars of cinematic culture as much as  mediums, “anthropomorphic apertures” to the vision of more just  futures. These Wgures are Phoolan Devi, the untouchable/Dalit “ban- dit queen” whose surrender to Indian security forces, election to Par- liament, and death by assassination established her as a prototype of  the subaltern insurgent and female avenger for constituencies in India  but also across the world; Mother Teresa, the saint beatiWed by the Cath- olic establishment and linked to global capital yet also venerated by  the poor of Calcutta among whom she worked; and Arundhati Roy,  the Booker Prize–winning novelist and environmental activist. What  is at stake is not so much an accounting of three particular Wgures,  though Ghosh’s scrutiny of their biographical, virtual, and popular cul- tural incarnations is thorough and multiply scaled. Nor is the book’s  understanding of iconicity peculiar to South Asia, even though Hindu  South Asia’s histories of iconophiliac religious devotion and of femi- nized Wgurations of community and territory give the material a rare  </page> <page sequence="3"> 216 Book Reviews resplendence. What the book seeks to do, beyond these particulars, is  to “renew an interdisciplinary materialist theory of the icon properly  attentive to its power in the contemporary world” (3). Hence its atten- tiveness to the forms and processes of global circulation, global legi- bility, and global–local (or “translocal”) interlocutions. But what is an icon and what does it do? For one thing, Ghosh  insists, it is crucial to pay heed to the affective and sensate character of  the icon—the sensuous materiality of its constituent components, the  proxemics of its display or circulation, and the sensory responses it  stirs in viewers or devotees. For another, icons are not and never have  been uncontested objects of veneration; they have tended to induce  what Bruno Latour calls “iconocrises” or “iconoclashes,” in which ven- eration competes with revulsion as well as a whole range of more  mixed, less easily classiWable emotions. Ghosh provides a marvelous  genealogy that addresses the place of the icon in the theology and state- craft of the Byzantine empire, and locates in the work of the Patriarch  Nikephoros a particularly suggestive way of thinking of the icon as “a  graphic opening toward the divine” (75) rather than in terms of veri- similitude and referentiality. This she conjugates with a discussion of  the icon/idol in the Hindu Brahmanical tradition, especially in terms  of darshan, in which the sacred image (whether of deity, sovereign, or  guru) beholds and is beheld by the devotee. This economy of mutual  seeing/touching has been most serviceable for scholars of South Asian  visual culture; here it functions usefully to establish the icon’s func- tion within a sensory, affective, and ethical Weld. Perhaps the most striking contribution in Ghosh’s reinscription of  iconicity is the idea of the bio-icon. These are living (or once living)  Wgures whose symbolic prestige is rooted in their biographies. For their  publics the details of their lives, whether real or imagined, are the stuff  of exemplary, even transcendent human achievement, and therefore  worthy of adoration. But, insofar as these details also showcase human  frailty and the challenges of right living, they can serve as pedagogical  lessons, open to emulation and therefore the transformation of the dev- otee’s life. The bio-icon thus functions as “one just like us but also deeply  other” (54). This potent admixture of exemplarity and ordinariness or  familiarity permits the bio-icon to be invested with a representative and  even a vernacular status. Through them, and through the activity of  their adoration, publics come to be constituted as publics or collectives,  </page> <page sequence="4"> Book Reviews 217 especially as the allure of these icons expands across local and national  boundaries. This kind of passage across the local, the translocal, and  the global is crucial to the “magical efWcacy” (70) of the icon. It helps  release the biographical latencies and excesses that promote the emer- gence of a totemic Wgure. It serves besides to create imagined commu- nities (of common interest and of attachment) among actors who are  spatially disaggregated and who do not belong to a preexisting socio- logical category. For socially and economically disenfranchised subjects  in particular, these collectives of adoration articulate a moral economy  that is distinct from the privileges of globalized citizenship whether at  a state or corporate level—privileges within whose purview they can- not be accommodated in the normal course of things. While each of the bio-icons featured here is of a distinctive kind— Ghosh identiWes them as the outlaw, the saint, and the activist—with  her own kind of devotional public, not necessarily continuous with  those of the others, they are all notable for their capacity to rouse intense  affects, positive and negative. They are marked, in fact, for their capac- ity to arouse controversy, sometimes in ways that are difWcult to seg- regate from the logics of commoditization and fetishism. But producing  a balance sheet of their personal virtue or lack of it may be to miss the  point about the contingent forms of their iconicity. What is distinctive  about it is the fact that they come to be mobilized, and not just in  South Asia but globally, as vehicles of a popular dissent from neolib- eralism’s new world order; they become the property of a contingent  and heterogeneous collective essaying the possibility of social trans- formation, both within and outside organized social movements. The  outlaw incarnates the hope of subaltern insurgency against a state to  whose legal forms of recognition she remains ex-orbitant; the saint  points to a giving outside an economistic calculus; and the activist  embodies the hope of a global environmentalism of the poor against  techno-scientiWc development. They may come to this position wit- tingly or unwittingly, sometimes in life and sometimes in death. As in  the case of other bio-icons such as Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy,  Che Guevara, and Princess Diana, death, as an opening into an imag- ined future, seems to amplify the iconicity of the saint and the Dalit  outlaw. In the case of the bio-icons studied here, it is often a window  of opportunity for agglomerating and articulating unsatisWed demands  and thus for populist expression. </page> <page sequence="5"> 218 Book Reviews “Yearning” is thus a keyword in thinking of these icons, as are  “imagination,” “projection,” and “utopia.” Ghosh’s work here overlaps  to some degree with that of Arjun Appadurai, who famously described  the imagination as “an organized Weld of social practices, a form of  work, . . . and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individu- als) and globally deWned Welds of possibilities” (1996, 31). Social trans- formation requires, therefore, a training of the imagination and cannot  rest upon alterations in policy prescriptions and material circumstances  alone. Thus, the poor are poor not only because of their material depri- vation but because they have been robbed of “the capacity to aspire,”  a crucial navigational tool for advancing into the future; their challenge  is to transform the “politics of probability” into a “politics of possibil- ity” (Appadurai 2013, 1). What might we conclude, then, about the kind of work that the bio- icon does in the post-1989 period? What, in particular, might icon ado- ration and desecration tell us about the logics of populism in a globalized  and neoliberal order? In her outline of the publics forged through a  relationship to the bio-icon, Ghosh limns the contours of a movement  that falls outside the explanatory grids of civil society, identity poli- tics, or even the politics of the multitude. Moving away from an icon- oclastic logic that would see the three icons under consideration in  terms of the logic of commodity fetishism alone, she introduces a syn- tax of plenitude, asking us to take seriously the cathexes, the dynamic,  and the ethicopolitical potential of popular devotion. Such a move per- mits a reading of affects and events normally situated outside the ambit  of political rationality and political legibility as emblematic of new  political and ethical logics. It gives us a sketch, at least in the case of  the publics of Phoolan Devi and Mother Teresa, of the public culture  of those at the margins of the social, those whose behaviors have been  seen within a liberal logic as aberrant, undeveloped, and irrational, if  not dangerous. In a canny extension of Ranajit Guha’s reading (in Ele- mentary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency) of the religious idioms of subaltern  insurgency, Global Icons gives us a way of reading emotional abandon  and devotion as signiWers of transformative possibilities we are still  struggling to recognize. This is generative, moreover, for thinking about  the relationship between subalternity and the domain of popular cul- ture, a relationship that scholars of subaltern studies have only recently  begun to subject to theoretical reXection. And, though the book focuses  </page> <page sequence="6"> Book Reviews 219 on a neoliberal era, it seems that the features that Ghosh details about  the bio-icons of our contemporaneity might be applied retrospectively  for bio-icons of earlier historical periods—prophets, seers, gurus, heroes,  revolutionaries, and martyrs, many of whom also had a global circula- tion. The case of Gandhi, whom Ghosh names and discusses in some  detail, is surely an instance of the applicability of this book’s paradigm  to other temporal horizons than the present. Ghosh’s deployment of the tropes of volatility, negotiation, ex- orbitation, and cutting, pasting, and remixing/reassembly usefully  high lights for us the improvisational and often unpredictable charge  these icons carry; far from their meanings being Wxed once and for all,  they are contested Wgures and, as such, also richly condensed symbols  and occasionally catalysts of social and political transformation. With  Ernesto Laclau, she suggests that the populist reason at work among  such publics is the very logic of the political. It emerges through oppo- sition to elites and coheres around a powerful symbol or ideal that  serves to create aggregations of equivalences among multiple and  sometimes competing demands. Rhetorically and contingently pro- duced, the subject of populist reason emerges as the performative result  of posing these claims, sometimes extra-legally. But while for Laclau  populism is a formal political logic of democratic polities, irrespective  of content, Ghosh dwells on its utopian potentialities, its capacity to  bring forth “performances that negotiate mass-media signals to renew  social relations” (19). It is possible to take a more agnostic view about the emancipatory  potential of the populist politics that accretes around bio-icons. Indeed,  Ghosh’s desire to invest these forms of political thought and action with  a progressive charge is occasionally at odds with her admirable regard  for the icon’s volatility. The evidence of the life, and the afterlife, of the  bio-icon that is Mother Teresa—the institutionalization by the Roman  Catholic church, the respect of middle-class Calcuttans, and the wor- ship of the very poor, all existing simultaneously—suggests that social  antagonisms and contradictions and therefore political aspirations  might remain unresolved and unconsolidated among the various con- stituencies that make up a public. Roy’s case also makes clear the neces- sity of caution in assigning primarily dissident potentialities to adoring  publics. Roy was rendered a bio-icon before her incarnation as an envi- ronmental activist, and in ways that merit consideration. Her fame as  </page> <page sequence="7"> 220 Book Reviews a Booker Prize–winning novelist established her as a new heroine of  postcolonial writing, a body of work that garnered prestige through  international prizes. It also made her the locus of an extraordinary  degree of nationalist triumphalism about India’s supposed moment of  arrival on the world stage. Her sudden and spectacular success on an  international stage coincided fortuitously with the liberalization of the  Indian economy; this conjuncture served to turn her for many people  (and much to her own dismay) into a phantasmic advertisement of  the pleasures of exoticism and the promise of globalization. This Wrst  and more vulgar personiWcation as a bio-icon surely shadows the sec- ond one as critic of globalization and champion of the subcontinent’s  subaltern subjects, and troubles the endeavor to attach her iconicity or  her publics solely to a stance critical of globalization. But these are relatively minor quibbles about emphasis. One can- not but be grateful for a book that establishes the rich liveliness of mass  mediated Wgures and the multiple worlds that they come to inhabit.  Its accentuation of the material density and diversity of media and  textual archives works very effectively to dispel the reXex censorious- ness that mass media induce in many cultural critics. And its careful  mapping of a comparative and transcultural grammar of iconicity in  the aesthetics and politics of democracy in late capitalism is an impres- sive achievement. Scholars and students of cultural and political the- ory, art history, religion, literary studies, anthropology, and visual media  will Wnd it a stimulating and indispensable work.
