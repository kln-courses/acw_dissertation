<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rua the Red Grouse by Patrick Devaney, illustrated by Don Conroy. 95 pages. Irish Peatland Conservation Council, Dublin. 1987. IR?4.50. This book is published by the Irish Peatland Conservation Council as part of its education programme which aims to provide a varied range of source material for use in schools. The story of Rua, the red grouse who lives in Drumeen Bog in a remote part of Ireland, is used to convey to a wider audience than a 'dry' scientific publication would reach, the richness of the raised bog habitat, the intricate web of interdependence which links the myriad plants and animals of this unique ecosystem, and their lives and deaths through the four seasons of a year. The sensitive and evocative descriptive writing reveals the hidden beauties of this threatened habitat, and the delicate line drawings of Don Conroy complement the text. The touching story of the life and death of Rua and his struggle to survive and guard his family against the many perils which surround them is told with a minimum of anthropomorphism. The human characters who epitomize the conflicting views on environmental matters current today are perhaps less imaginatively conceived. Their stories, however, mirror the story of the grouse: Rua and the Bank Manager, his would-be protector, both die, but the survival of Sorcha with a potential new mate, paralleled by the budding romance between the cattle dealer's daughter and the vet's son and their continued campaign to save the rest of the bog conveys the hopeful message that life continues and conservation still stands a chance if action is taken in time. It is to be hoped that this little story will have the effect it deserves in raising public awareness of the value and uniqueness of this endangered habitat. The profits from its sale will be channelled into the Save the Bogs campaign launched by the IPCC to purchase threatened peatlands and conserve them for future generations to enjoy.
