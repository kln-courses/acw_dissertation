<plain_text><page sequence="1">Interpretation, the Spirit in the Body Dudley Andrew I Human activities vary from culture to culture and epoch to epoch with re- gard to the function they serve. Religion in one culture is a paramount political force, while, in another, it is a mode of philosophy; sport bears a religious value at one moment and is fully ludic at a later period. When we think of art, even the arts in the context of western civilization, we must be careful not to credit to earlier eras the needs we feel that art fulfills in our own. More pertinently, we must read philosophers of art from the past with a view toward the phe- nomenon they set out to describe and explain; and that phenomenon, despite outward appearances, changes in relation to the mission it is expected to serve. This orientation helps us understand the rise and fall of key concepts in art theory across history. Our struggle to incorporate into modern aesthetics Aris- totle's notions of unity or catharsis have pointed this up only too clearly. The role of interpretation is just such a concept, only this time we are dealing with a notion whose modern currency is valued far differently (and far higher) than it ever has been before. Indeed, it is a crowning concept in contemporary aesthetics whereas, throughout most of the history of the world, it has been a mere, though necessary, technique. What ambitions have accrued to interpretation, and through it, to art? How has interpretation set itself apart from other men- tal acts in order to reign over a broad and rich cultural terrain? Let us remind ourselves of the stakes at play. The widespread popularity of the new hermeneutics has brought interpretation to the center of higher realms of cultural philosophy and we will have to confront it there; but hermeneutics is more than another critical fad, for it rests on a modernist concern about the relativity Qf judgment that affects all disciplines, particularly humanistic ones such as aesthetics. Indeed, as soon as we go beyond sheerly biological processes like sensation, modern theorists feel the need to invoke interpretation. Basic perceptual theory, for instance, now rests on the founding notion of contextual alignment wherein the organism selects the stimuli which it needs to attend to in any given instance. Such previous perception theories as nativism and em- piricism here are corrected by a theory that is sensitive to the situations within which perception occurs. There is no longer a single notion of seeing; rather there are "modes of seeing," and every mode depends on the project the organ- ism finds itself engaged in. At a higher level representations of all sorts, as E. H. Gombrich has so incon- trovertibly shown, result from complexes of interpretation which might be called "seeing as" to oppose it to the more perceptual "seeing." All instances of "seeing as" must be based on initial interpretations, a fact brought out every Dudley Andrew 57</page><page sequence="2">time we are forced to convince another viewer of the rightness of our view of the representation standing before both of us. We see an array of lines as a duck or as a rabbit. We take Marcello Mastroianni in "81/2" as a filmmaker and certain of the film's images as his direct inner thought or visions. When we go beyond these activities that form the base of artworks we begin to encounter head on such intertextual issues as style, genre, and allusion-all of which are by defini- tion historically determined and subject in the first instance to complex processes of interpretation. Here the artworks themselves not only call for specific acts of interpretation, but they also function as interpreters of tradition themselves. These and other aspects of artworks, such as identification, require more or less automatic acts of interpretation from the reader or spectator in the normal func- tioning of the experience. A much more concentrated locus of interpretation is occasioned by those parts of artworks we designate as figures. It is here that the issue of interpretation was originally seen as an issue at all, for figures are por- tions of artworks which, by definition, defy common sense and immediate understanding. They are meant to be difficult and to engender a specific type of work on the part of the reader/spectator, even if, as seems to be the case in classi- cal aesthetics, they ultimately must be resolved into a standard meaning. Figures are the crowning instances of interpretive operations which go on all through the experience of artworks. The fact that they point to this effort, however, allows us to use them in considering the value art places on itself in different epochs. We can say schematically that figures in classical art from the Greeks to the Romantics were meant to arouse active interest, to embellish and underline ideas, and to certify the work as indeed artistic. Interpretation in such an aesthetic was called upon to rectify the confusing, appreciate the subtle, and multiply the thought of the text as it developed itself in a measured way. Since the Romantics, figures have enjoyed a more primary value in our con- ception of the work of art, and interpretation has consequently taken on a more central status. Figures can now be thought of as original and irreducible ways of expressing whatever works of art are thought to express. Interpretation then becomes the special way we have of talking about the irreducible. If we value artistic expression, and privilege it as a kind of discourse from which we gain something unavailable to other modes of discourse, then interpretation may be- come an essential way of dealing with the essential. Far from merely rectifying the confusions of art with the clarity of logical or moral discourse, interpreta- tion in the Post Romantic Age is valuable in itself as it romps within the areas marked out by the figures it is tied to. Interpretation is a highly regarded concept today because it negotiates the space between mind and body that modern culture wants so badly to traverse. Supported by Greek philosophy, our Christian, particularly Protestant, heritage polarized man and his activities generally according priority to purely rational thought. This rationality might appreciate and analogize the physical side of 58 Interpretation</page><page sequence="3">life but seldom wanted to take its cue from the body or even from the body of physical situations we call history. Kant's Critique of Judgement was instrumental in raising "taste" and our perpetual concern for the physically beautiful to a level of key philosophic importance, where it might sanction the operation of pure and moral reason, crippled by its own inability to justify itself. Since Kant and the Age of Romanticism, philosophy has been primarily the story of various integrations of mind and body, until philosophy allowed itself to be undermined by the more body-sensitive disciplines of anthropology and psychoanalysis. Rationality today is seldom conceived of in pure terms; rather it is determined by culture, by need, by power, and by the physical limits of language. This orientation shapes the thought of thinkers with quite varied attitudes toward life. Michel Foucault inherits a European pessimism from Nietzsche and discovers all thought to be self-interested, with philosophy exist- ing as merely another index of a culture's peculiar way of promoting certain voices and repressing others. Instead of interpreting an age for us, philosophy conspires with the age to be its justification. This blind determinism has little in common with the American pragmatism of someone like John Dewey, but Richard Rorty finds the two men engaged in quite the same project: that of lodging reason inside the needs of the body and of history. Dewey simply wants to make the best use of the situation, to the point of glorying in the mus- cular operations of the mind. Even a conservative and essentially religious thinker like Michael Polanyi, eager as he is to maintain against Foucault such notions as freedom and faith, feels the need to open his book Meaning with a solid attack on the alleged faculties of scientific rationality and to close it with a plea for at- tention to and belief in the symbols we are drawn to. For him humans carry within them structures of "tacit knowledge" which direct their conscious proj- ects and dictate value. And so, from the profoundly skeptical Foucault right up to the religious Po- lanyi, reason is seen as a governed as much as a governing power. Its most ele- gant and transcendent flights launch from what Yeats called "the foul rag and bone shop of the heart." The flesh of reason gives Polanyi hope that truth is embedded in the skin of things, while Foucault finds in this same flesh only the seethings of an irrational struggle for survival and power. Central to prevalent attitudes toward mind and body has been the movement of phenomenology, especially in its French, existentialist emanation, and it is in this climate that the most current hermeneutics grew. When Merleau-Ponty determined to seek and describe the "body's reasons," he paved the way for studies as diverse as those on religion, sexuality, social demographics, and so on. But most lasting has been the theory of language and texts which phenom- enology ushered in; under the pressure of a rising interest in structural linguis- tics, it was to the "skin of language" that Merleau-Ponty felt most drawn in order to bring forth his final meditations. Dudley Andrew 59</page><page sequence="4">Interest in hermeneutics stems directly from an interest in the confrontation of the human subject with texts which at first are foreign to him or befuddle him. Against the computer-age structural methodologies which eliminate the reader while foregrounding the mechanism of meaning in the text, hermeneu- tics has tried to remind us that reading is an activity whereby the mind is incar- nated in the skin of a book and behaves in describable ways. Instead of putting the analyst in a position of power over the text as structuralism has often ex- plicitly sought to do, hermeneutics is a theory which entertains the relation- ship between a text worthy of respect and a consequential, historically grounded reading of that text. We might think of structuralism as bearing a most cere- bral attitude toward meaning, even though it finds all meaning to depend on mere mechanism. Hermeneutics, on the other hand, proceeds from history, de- sire, and value. It seeks in the body of the text the significance which only that body has for it. II The hermeneutic tradition which comes to us from the Romantic Age arose as a desperate response to the experience of spatial and temporal viscosity in the pursuit of meaning. Up to I800 readers, or so it seems, were capable of digest- ing unproblematically whatever texts were presented them (assuming they were familiar with the language of the writing). But Schleiermacher and later Dil- they found it necessary to overcome obstacles of cultural and historical distance thrown in the way above all by theological skeptics. Hermeneutics developed first as a concern, then as a method, and finally as a theory about the behavior of mind in confrontation with the alterity of texts, especially those from which it is physically (historically, culturally, linguistically) estranged. As it grew toward the ambitious philosophical proportions it was to assume under Heidegger and Gadamer, hermeneutics had first to establish itself as an enterprise distinct from the disciplines of linguistics and philology which, es- pecially in the nineteenth century, had set about conquering the foreignness of languages and texts. This development was aided in the first place by the decisive shift linguistics underwent in our century under the banner of Saussurean structuralism. Sys- tematically repudiating the importance of history in the study of language, Saussure and his followers have attempted the description of the logic of syntax, or "langue," according little value to actual speech events ("parole"). And so hermeneutics, far more intrigued by the historicity of actual discursive events than by some invariable linguistic capability, found a field in which to grow that was rich through years of fallowness. Naturally it has employed the astounding gains of structural linguistics, but it has in no way set itself up as a rival discip- line. Its object is quite different. More recently, structural linguistics has given 60 Interpretation</page><page sequence="5">way to generative grammar, discourse analysis, and even speech act theory, all tending to blur the distinction between langue and parole and to bring her- meneutics potentially into the mainstream of language study. In its formative years, however, hermeneutics upheld as its own the study of the behavior of "significance" as opposed to the logic of "meaning." A second venerable tradition from which hermeneutics has been forced to dis- engage is philology. Even older than linguistics, philology is the discipline as- sociated with distant texts, primarily classical ones. Its methods are historical in the extreme, and its goal is the correct understanding of the text as it was writ- ten. Philology relies on the history of languages, on etymology, dialect study, the vicissitudes of syntax and vocabulary, but it adds to this the fruits of cultural erudition. The philologist feels in a position to pass down distant texts to us because he has read so widely that every text takes its proper place in his mind and every word settles into its most likely acceptation. Biography and history round out the philologist's undertaking to provide the densest possible situation out of which the words of the text usher. The philologist really feels himself a part of the original audience of the text; all his schooling permits him this out- rageous presumption. The decline of philology in our day is due in large part to the decline of clas- sical education. Who now has mastered the innumerable languages and cul- tures which Leo Spitzer or Erich Auerbach felt right at home in? Who has read the bodies of literature which permit easy access to any given text? In our theo- retically sophisticated era we have as a group lost contact with literature. Cer- tainly experts exist for every period, but few are left who command knowledge of language, stylistics, metrics, and comparative grammar and who can put these skills at the service of a sweeping view of texts in an array of cultures. Perhaps a more telling reason for the debasement of philology is an internal crisis of its own making. Nietzsche's case is paradigmatic, for as the leading philologist of his day he only intermittently felt comfortable plying his trade. Far more of his energy went into a critique of interpretation, so radical that it altogether paralyzed the conservative and self satisfied philological tradition. With Nietzsche begins a metaphysical interest wherein the issues of interpreta- tion become so problematized that they are raised to key concerns in philosophy. Heidegger and Gadamer have extended this questioning, but the ideal of a clear and regulated philology is so attractive that it still has its proponents today. E. D. Hirsch has been central to the popularization of hermeneutics precisely because of the eloquent and staunchly conservative philological position that he has held for two decades. Hirsch's position is really quite simple. Given in- numerable ways to read a text, we ought, he claims, to give preeminence to that reading which captures the meaning lodged in the text at the moment of its composition. Once accepted, this position devolves into a panoply of tech- niques capable of determining the meaning closest to that which the author in- tended. Dudley Andrew 61</page><page sequence="6">Hirsch's view has always been the norm in debates over interpretation, but attacks on this tradition have grown stronger since Heidegger. Hirsch himself summarized the opposition by placing meaning over and against significance, claiming that interpretation must strive to recover meaning, while mere criti- cism may assert the significance of a text for such and such an individual or age. Even his staunchest opponents are prepared to accept Hirsch's distinction, though they either deny the existence of primal meaning or maintain that it is no more consequential than other significant readings of the text. Stemming as it does from phenomenological roots, hermeneutics must clearly oppose any ob- jectivist notion of truth or of the text. The point of departure for phenom- enologists is not the text but rather the act of reading or of interpreting. Indeed they would surely assert that the text exists only as read and that Hirsch's pro- gram to discover the meaning of the pristine text, as it exists unread and eternal, is altogether phantasmic. As was the case with linguistics, hermeneutics relies upon the techniques of philology but plans a very different program of textual study. In past decades that program has outstripped the projects of philology and become one of the crucial means by which modern intellectual culture as- sesses its life. III The point of departure for hermeneutics couldn't be more evident: what do we have to do when we don't understand what we read? This problem arises with force only when the need for understanding is great; and it is thus natural that the term and the first methods of hermeneutics developed in relation to the Bible. The Bible and other religious texts, but the Bible in particular, make an extraordinary demand on every reader. Indeed we might characterize the Bible in toto as a demand or at least an invitation. The stakes of understanding have never been higher, for lives are shaped in response to this demand and en- tire cultures develop around the reading of this text. The fact that the Bible is written in obscure language, that it is recalcitrant and often contradictory, makes interpretation necessary even to the point of institutionalizing hermeneutics. For the Bible needs to readdress itself to each generation and, it is claimed, to each individual; and if salvation comes via a proper way of living in relation to the word of God, then that way must be achieved and insured through interpre- tation. All religions founded on a sacred text regulate the reading of the text through institutionalized interpretation. More generally, hermeneutics has come into play in the application of legal precedents, particularly when a found- ing document supports the culture. As in the case of religious life, the civic or- ganization of society depends on the continued interrelation between the prin- ciples of the past and the events of the present. Those principles may be lodged exclusively in a charter, or code, especially when this is given the force of a reli- gious text (i.e., the Koran); or the principle may be thought to evolve in history 62 Interpretation</page><page sequence="7">wherein interpretation builds on the precedent of earlier interpretation, all based on a very few principles thought to be inviolable. This latter would seem to be the system operating in the United States, and it is one which clarifies the project of hermeneutics in a remarkable way. Examine any legal case and you immediately find two quite different sorts of discourse: that which invokes le- gal precedent (cases heard by appeals courts, most often) or first principle (the Constitution or Bill of Rights) and that which lays out in intricate and often loving detail the historical circumstances of the case at hand. The fusion of the present and the past, of history and earlier interpretations of justice, is a com- plex human activity that can be reduced neither to pure description nor to logic. This interpenetration of horizons (the present and the past) requires acts of judgment, of reading which are exemplary for all reading. Of course we pro- mote and institutionalize this effort because the stakes again are high, far higher in our legalistic culture than the interpretation of religious texts. We feel the specific weight of legal writing in civic life, which exists as a web of interpreta- tions so intricate it can inspire a Borges or Calvino. The texts of literature are really very similar to those of religion and law. Poetic, narrative, or dramatic formulations of values that the culture can't or doesn't want to let go readdress every generation required to read them. This requirement may have the force of law behind it, as when Paradise Lost was in the course schedule of all college students, but it may also emerge as a strong in- vitation to a select number of readers, an invitation through the name of the author, other books of the period or genre, and various other sign posts by which the mechanism of cultural dissemination goes about its work. However felt, the urge to read a literary text ushers in a hermeneutic situation comparable to that operating in religion and law, for the reader finds himself confronted in his own day with a valued discourse written in the past. In what way can he cross over to the text or assimilate it to himself? This problem is exacerbated by the deeply figurative language characterizing literary texts and by our sense that in such language lies harbored the values a culture continually returns to or questions. As in the areas of law and religion, it is evident that an institution had to grow up to regulate the interpretation of these cultural treasures we call litera- ture, both to guard the national values and to insure the proper education of each literate citizen. As for the citizen, when he is called to read a text, for whatever reason, he finds himself forced to flesh out the meaning offered by the text. The institution by which the individual and the culture deal with litera- ture can be termed criticism; its theory is hermeneutics. IV The recent surge of interest in hermeneutics comes from at least two quite different wellsprings, that of reflective philosophy and that of avantgarde literary Dudley Andrew 63</page><page sequence="8">texts, concluding with a meditation dedicated to Sartre on a number of critically irreducible photographs. The phenomenological method of his book on Michelet was followed by the trenchantly structuralist Elements of Semiotics, "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative," and Systeme de la Mode. Then came the period of S/Z, which was followed by the anarchic Pleasure of the Text and the quasiautobio- graphical essays published just before and after his death. More than any other figure of our era, Barthes embodies the opposition of mind and body posed at the outset of this essay. His defense of the new novel and his critical systems promote the domination of texts by the play of reason in all its computeristic potentiality. Yet the recent Barthes, and even many of his earlier works, focuses on the unanalyzable particularity of texts, on what he, above all critics, was apt to call their bodies. Criticism became for him an erotics, a sensory explora- tion of words, discourse, and mind. His turn toward hermeneutics, toward an interest in discourse, stems from a neohedonism, from the call of pleasure, the claims of the instant, the obsessions of the reader that are not susceptible to sys- tem. This was notable as early as his film essay, "The Third Meaning," where he struggled to name the unnameable, to signify the kind of significance that, in certain images, cannot be explained by reference to story, rhetoric or even style. Certain images simply call to us from the sheer epidermis of their presence. So unconcerned about the logic or argument of the text he prefers, Barthes has utterly forsaken the study of sequence and consequence. Several of his own recent writings are organized alphabetically by topic so that he might remain true to the immediacy of the kind of significance he hopes to represent. In addi- tion he has abandoned all metalanguage, trying to write these moments in their own primary language. These aspects make his hermeneutical method the op- posite of the carefully composed philosophical discourse of Ricoeur. Yet, like Ricoeur, he is interested in pursuing not the text so much as that which the text insists upon. For Barthes, this referential aspect is entirely emotional. Texts in their most hieratic moments point to the inner states recognized by the reader: states of anxiety, of waiting, of jealousy, and the like. The text em- bodies these states carnally, and Barthes's direct, lengthy, unsystematic atten- tion to them is meant to leave them open. Hermeneutics gives back to the study of literature its pretense of referentiality. The text is not exhausted by a study of its logic and system, for certain of its nodes are directly related to, and express, aspects of lived life. Barthes may want to limit these aspects to personal, intimate psychological memories, but he has left the door open for claims to larger domains of reference. A Jungian will assert the connection of certain literary or visual patterns to transpersonal exper- ience. Barthes died before having to confront the risk of mysticism hovering over his later writings. But his whole career provides us with a type of response: literary discourse for him is an oscillation between logic and figure, between 64 Interpretation</page><page sequence="9">system and the immediately carnal. Criticism must oscillate as well, never aban- doning its investigation of the mechanism of meaning even while it isolates and caresses those privileged points of significance that strike it with the force of the physical. One of Barthes's earliest meditations on this issue arose in connection with the problem of connotation as discussed in the final essay of Mythologies. There he asserted the difference of denotation (logic) from connotation (body) and the dependence of the latter on the former. In a classic formulation he demon- strated the hidden logic of all connotation, indicating thereby that all meaning is systematic and that none of it connects in any special way to nature, life, or history. Though ideology will always marshall certain connotations of mean- ing to insist on their natural or historical priority, in fact this is only the decep- tion of a mechanism that the analyst can and must uncover. With this essay Barthes led the way for a full scale attack on the rhetoric of figures, tropes, and special meanings of all sorts. Structural linguistics being unchallenged in Europe in the I96os, such witchhunts proceeded confidently under a belief in synchrony, in system, and in the power of the almighty langue over any of its emanations, including sacred texts or newly forged figures. While there has been no relaxation in this nearly scientific drive to describe the workings of poetic language (witness the work of the Liege group), a clear shift in the intellectual climate has occurred, evidenced above all in Barthes's re- formulation of his initial proposition. Denotation, far from being the irreducible origin of all other, more extended meanings, now must be understood to exist only as the final sum of connotation, as its settling down to the proper pertinency of meaning in such and such a situation. This shift supports Ricoeur's monu- mental study of metaphor in which he upholds the growing suspicion that all standard meanings arose figuratively and that the dictionary is merely a record of previous meaning events rather than a rule book of an ideal semantic universe. True, the events of language have largely been forgotten in the dictionary ex- cept in the exemplary sentences drawn most often from literary sources, but the meanings remain as testimony to the linguistic struggles to say something in situations. We who use the dictionary do so in our own history as we seek to bend the system of language to our needed purpose. The event in which we replicate earlier uses of the system, or force it to meet our own requirements under the pressure of a figure that we develop, is the standard event of lan- guage, not some aberration or perverse use of a logical machine. Thus connota- tion makes us attend to the sentence as much as to the word as we construe or construct a pertinent implication with the force of new usage. In redescribing the dictionary as a pulsing, historically sensitive record of hu- man exchange, Ricoeur justifies the detour through hermeneutics that the mind must take in its quest for certainty, a detour involving the body of language and the flesh of history. In clearing ground for his own measured hermeneutics, Dudley Andrew 65</page><page sequence="10">practice. These two sources are readily represented in the careers of Paul Ri- coeur and Roland Barthes. Ricoeur's turn toward hermeneutics derives from a perfectly consistent, life- long body of work which began with his studies of Husserl. His immense study of the problem of will culminated in a renunciation of direct reflection. The way to understanding man's discontinuity with himself was barred, he felt, by the limitations of reflection itself, by the disjunction between reason and that which it hoped to understand. A detour was needed through the quasirational expressions of history and of bodily life, expressions we call symbols. In The Symbolism of Evil we find Ricoeur's first interpretive gesture. Although as a philosopher he had been reading the rational thought of his predecessors for years, he now confronted another type of thinking: the physical, deeply-coded and value-laden expressions that individuals and cultures throw up over and over to heal the breaks in life. As provocative and stimulating as The Symbolism of Evil was, it only initiated what has become a labyrinth of detours, for Ricoeur was uncomfortable with the success he had attained. In the face of structuralism, psychoanalysis, and ideological critiques, how could he maintain the right to interpret the expressions of the past in such an unproblematic way? His debates with Levi-Strauss, his monumental study of Freud, his essays on linguistics and on metaphor, all led him to formulate a precise hermeneutics in which the goals, problems, and claims of interpretation could be precisely marked out. His system is deceptively simple, breaking into a traditional triad of moments in our experience with any major text. Understanding accounts for our initial acceptance of the work, our recognition of its importance in our lives, and, in short, our capitulation to its textual force. Without understanding we would pass over a text as we do over perceptual life; it would be a moment of recogni- tion hardly persisting into our future. But understanding thrusts the text into our life of meaning and exposes it thereby to the critiques which Ricoeur labels "explanation." Nearly the whole of academic life in the humanities concerns itself with explaining the assertions of texts. Primarily a regressive mode of in- terpretation, explanation aims to dissolve the text in its origins, to find the rea- sons for its claim on us. The text is situated in its various contexts (biographical, generic, historical) and is subjected to linguistic study, psychoanalysis, and ideo- logical critique until the particularity of its appeal is explained as an effect of these generating forces. This important step in our relation with a given text removes us somewhat from its aura and forces us to recognize that language does not permit truths to be uttered directly or at all, that the forces of the un- conscious derail and reroute our purported drive toward truth and that, in any case, truth is conditioned by the historical situation, since discourses never arise in limbo, but always derive from the struggle of discourses, a struggle we must never separate from the social struggle that is the life of history. 66 Interpretation</page><page sequence="11">Understanding and explanation account for the work of the academic profession in relation to texts and to students, for we teach, generally in succession, the appreciation of major texts and then the methods of analysis that turn apprecia- tion into suspicion if not explanation. In short, to use Ricoeur's terms, we al- low the text to master us only to return with the mastering disciplines of analysis. If Ricoeur is critical of the life of interpretation in the academy, it is not be- cause he resents the analytical moment of explanation. Without it, we would be caught in a narcissistic union with the text and be blind to its cultural inter- connections. But explanation is not our last moment with a text, or rather, it is not for many readers at many times. Despite our analytical distance, we are still able to return to those texts that appeal to us and derive value from re- newed contact with them. This third moment he names "comprehension," sig- naling thereby the expansion of the reader to the size of the text and to its speci- fic shape. Comprehension is synthetic in that it listens to the wholeness of the text rather than breaking it into parts; further, it responds to the cues that it finds in the work, initiating a project of meaning that is never complete. To think with and through the work is the final step of Ricoeur's hermeneutics even while this final step is interminable (at least in the cases of those texts on which we depend personally or culturally). The work lives in the web of its in- terpretations, in their history and in the projected meanings to which they point. It lives even in their conflict. This sketch of Ricoeur's attitudes points up the priority of discourse over meaning, of interpretation over structure. Analysis would try to fix the posi- tion of a text, while interpretation presumes that the work of meaning is on- going. As he has often pointed out, every speech involves both an event in which it occurs and a meaning that persists beyond the event. Hermeneutics tries to be adequate to the whole complex of discourse by keeping both poles of speech (meaning and event) in constant interplay. One can analyze the meaning of the text as a relation of signifiers and signifieds, but the significance of the moment of speech (that is, of the reading) involves context and reference. The text is about something and therefore calls for our continued appraisal. Ri- coeur here butts up against one of the great philosophical issues of our century: the relation of meaning, sense, and reference. As a philosopher, it is only right that his hermeneutics arises in such a reflection, or rather, as a response to the inability of pure reflection to solve the disjunction between these terms. Roland Barthes has come to a different type of hermeneutics from a totally different path. A reader rather than a philosopher, his development hasn't the consistent growth from a central node that one can see so clearly in Ricoeur. Barthes is perhaps the greatest critic of our epoch because of his responsiveness to texts, to culture, and to the movement of his own mind and body. Originally considered a hardline structuralist, particularly in opposition to Sartre, his work actually oscillates between a concern for system and for the particularity of Dudley Andrew 67</page><page sequence="12">Ricoeur has also opened up a field of play for the figural acrobatics of Roland Barthes. "Figure," a word which connotes both abstract patterning and the physicality of a face, thus holds together the philosophical projects of Ricoeur and the nearly hedonistic ramblings of Barthes. More precisely, figure is the pertinent unit of study for all those pursuing mind through body and the body in the mind. A Lover's Discourse: Fragments. Seldom has a title so fully expressed the method and intent of a text. Roland Barthes's final meditations came piecemeal, not be- cause they were hurried, but because he deplored the systematization of all meaning. Some meanings, like some photographs, are not replaceable by alter- nate formulations; some refuse analysis by a metalanguage. In his late writings Barthes wrote what he called a "primary" language on the same level as the writing that fascinated him. In this way he aimed to retain the uniqueness of what he constantly referred to as the "figures" that obsessed him. Sentences and meaning may be exchangeable, but the figure is what it is as it is. Its appeal to us is as carnal and as irreplaceable as a face we love. Our response to it is also carnal-a caress, a savoring, an exploration and extension of the sense we feel in it for our lives. The anthropomorphism of the figure in the text has a long tradition. Ri- coeur appeals to this tradition when he argues that certain texts call to the reader as a person calls. Doubtless thinking foremost of the Bible, his point spreads across the whole of literature and becomes the catchword of hermeneu- tics. The call of the text is the responsibility of the reader, who must interpret by "fleshing out" what stands before him toward his future. Barthes has taken this view in his inimitable and personal way: a figure is any textual unit exert- ing its own force on us as we read, making us halt and contemplate if only to feel more deliciously the thrust of its formulation. Barthes was always interested in reading as a process of rewriting small figures embedded in the relentless struc- ture of huge texts, figures that fascinate and address him, figures that cannot be dissolved in an overriding understanding of the text as a whole. This is the Barthes who sought out the "third meaning" in certain images from Eisenstein, a personal and nearly mystical meaning. In these nodes Barthes listens to the possibilities of a voice "about to speak," the "grain of the voice" as a site of future meaning, or more precisely, as the site of meaning in action. A gymnas- tic figural meaning is that which is caught in a pose and not contemplated in re- pose. From here Barthes can go on to his "anti-criticism" labeled in the "Dis- course of the Lover," which reaches out toward figures in a bodily gesture of desire. Barthes shamelessly discards all pretense toward generalizable meaning and lapses into a kind of private hedonism. Figures are like arias in an opera, he says, nodes which persist totally estranged from the argument or narrative which ostensibly gave rise to them. They are places of departure, turns of phrases, deviant images, anything in a text which is physically alluring. And the signi- 68 Interpretation</page><page sequence="13">fiance which they embody has a very limited plurality, usually associated, as we pointed out before, with psychic states recognized or remembered by the reader. Instead of the infinitude of readings he formerly wished on every writerly text, Barthes now champions those portions of texts which control us, master us, force us to attend to something undeniable in the shape of their formulation. In his Protestant way, Ricoeur likewise asserts the directed sense presided over by the figure; but for him a figure is more likely to include much larger units. Even an entire poem or novel may be said to comprise a figure insofar as the physicality of its formulation admits no substitution and forces us to re- imagine our semantic universe from the perspective of the pose it takes. The extended metaphor is not simply a clever rearranging of signifiers; it is an asser- tion that calls on our imaginations to complete it and that rewards those imagina- tions by the fruitfulness of the redescription it permits. Like Barthes, Ricoeur here insists on the role of the imagination and of new interpretation, but this role is played out under the control of the figure, whose posture demands that we think with it injust this way, no matter how extensive our thoughts may be as they spread across our past (Barthes) or future (Ricoeur). Ricoeur would consolidate the gains in thought permitted by a figure through his "approach/re- treat" dialectical hermeneutics that moves from understanding to analysis and on to a more comprehensive synthesis. Barthes doubtless would find this an- other snare by which the system tries to amalgamate the unique, by which mind tries to level the delicious differences which the body is able to touch. V The question of figuration in art may allow us to reintroduce some older con- cepts in aesthetics which have had a troubled history in our century: represen- tation and expression. To say that a text or artifact represents a person or idea or state of affairs suggests that there exists a determinate, public referent which the signifiers aim to call up. The job of the audience or reader is to fill in the cues in order to complete the representation. But artistic artifacts and texts re- serve for themselves the additional term "expression" to which no mechanical filling in is adequate. An expression, in Nelson Goodman's terms, exemplifies that which it represents. It is an embodiment of itself. We can't simply go from it to the concept of interest, for it is that concept just as a sample of red terrycloth is red terrycloth. What is the work of the reader in relation to the expression of figure or a whole artistic text? Barthes suggests that we abandon metalanguage and extend the body of the figure across our minds, writing out of the figure. Ricoeur would agree, in part, though to keep ourselves honest and to avoid solipsism, he would insist on distancing ourselves from the figure even as we determine to let it guide our thinking and our writing. In both cases, whatever such a text or fragment represents is merely a first step to our Dudley Andrew 69</page><page sequence="14">real interest, which is in the posture it adopts while representing. If structural methodologies taught us how to determine representation, hermeneutics is the science of reading expressive language, fleshing out the indeterminate array of concepts and feelings introduced and regulated by the work. This vocabulary should hardly sound strange to Barthes or Ricoeur for it de- rives, at least in its last incarnation, from phenomenological aesthetics and the writings of Dufrenne and Merleau-Ponty in particular. After two decades of structuralism had seemed to erase the particular, we now find that we have re- turned to a theory of the symbol, to its special attraction, and to a theory of reading that emanates from it. Aware of the mechanisms of language, psyche, and ideology, Barthes and Ricoeur, in their distinct ways, have nevertheless sig- naled a return to the particularity of the reading experience and to the call that texts, rather than languages, make to us in our own personal histories. A body of literature and the flesh of figures have intervened in the airy sciences derived from linguistics. Hermeneutics has gone out to meet that body. While we may still be interested in textuality as a type of behavior and still concern our- selves with the meanings of the representations texts make up, these behavioral and philological tasks should not keep us from the more human one of answer- ing the call expressed by the text in the aspirations and gutterals of its voice. To utter an expression is more than to designate a meaning; it is to respond to a situation with a certain cry. Figures are cries we cannot dismiss. What we do with them (fuse with them, enjoy them, analyze them, extend them, etc.) is as varied as there are interpreters and theories of interpretation. Yet doing any- thing with them whatsoever shows the interdependence of mind and body, of thought and voice, of meaning and expression. Certainly this is not an un- troubled interdependence, but it is one that gives to reading and writing a place in human life different from philosophy, analysis, or sheer behavior. This border- zone of reading is the life of the imagination. It is worth as much as we imagine it to be. The University of Iowa 70 Interpretation</page></plain_text>
