<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN THE AGGADA ROBERT L. KATZ Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati The Nature of Empathy EMPATHY is a psychological process by which the modern psychotherapist tries to understand the problems, the situation, and the feeling of his patient. Psychological science and therapy have drawn on a universal human experience and have made it a central feature of the study of human relationships. Jewish tradition was by no means unaware of the phenomenon of empathy. Rabbinic Aggada,Aggada, the area on which this part of our study will be focussed in the main, provides numerous illustrations of this kind of communica tion and understanding. It is in modern psychotherapy that the process of empathy has been more profoundly comprehended and described more explicitly. An important contribution of the science of modern psychology has been the distinction between empathy and sympathy.1 A comparative examination of empathy in science and in religion not only clarifies certain areas of common concern but also suggests direction and guidance for the rabbinic counselor. The present study is mainly concerned with theory rather than with inferences regarding the counseling activities of the religious leader. This is then a study in the psychology of religion; our frame of reference is psychological. Many of the sources to be cited from Biblical and Rabbinic literature have been classified under more conventionally theological rubrics such as "Immanence and Tran scendence," "God and Man," "Love, Human and Divine," "Mercy and Charity," "Grace," and "Religious Duties." Our chief concern is with the emotional, personal, and psychological implications of materials, many of which are already familiar to the theologian and ז Charles D.

KATZ [2] historian of Judaism.2 Seeking to understand certain aspects of Jewish tradition in terms of psychological categories, we propose to examine the processes of empathy, its ethics, its prerequisites, and its limits. I. The Process of Empathy As currently understood in psychotherapy, empathy designates the process by which the psychologist "feels himself into" the inner world of another person with whom he has established a therapeutic relationship. The goal is to communicate with another person in terms of his unique point of view and to appreciate a human dilemma as it is sensed and experienced by the other person. Although empathy as a concept was familiar to classic European writers and figured in the writings of ethical theorists, its use as a term in psychology is dated back to 1897 when T. Lipps described a process in aesthetics by which one projects himself into a pattern and feels himself into the materials of visual art.3 Alfred Adler believed that empathy was best characterized by these words of an anonymous English author: to see with the eyes of another, to hear with the ears of another, to feel with the heart of another.4 EinfiihlungEinfiihlung is the term for empathy in German. It is closely asso ciated with "intuition" and with "insight." The psychological process of identification is usually linked with empathy. In Freud's words, "it is the earliest expression of an emotional tie with another person."5 Harry Stack Sullivan believed that empathy was a kind of "emotional 2 A number of the Rabbinic references we interpret in terms of their psychological symbolism are used in the exposition of Jewish philosophy and theology.

And when you are near I will tear (sic) your eyes out and use them instead of mine, and you will tear my eyes out and use them instead of yours, then I will look at you with your eyes and you will look at me with mine." Moreno wrote this originally in Vienna in 1914 and quoted it on p. 27 of Progress in Psychotherapy, Vol. I, (edited by Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and J. L. Moreno), N. Y., Grune &amp; Stratton, 1956. 5 Complete Works, Vol. XVIII, London, Hogarth Press, 1950, p. 105 in the article on "Identification."</page><page sequence="3">[3] EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN AGGADA 193 contagion"6 and like Max Scheie!7־ suspected that the capacity for such emotional sensitivity suffers atrophy as the growing child takes his place in society and as civilization itself "progresses." Theodor Reik lucidly characterized the process of empathy and identification in his Listening with the Third Ear. It is a kind of communication from "one unconscious to another." A therapist can understand his patient only by a roundabout way of inner perception, as Reik noted: In order to comprehend the unconscious of another person, we must, at least for a moment, change ourselves into and become that person. We only comprehend the spirit whom we resemble.8 Students of human development have commented on the normal process of identification of the child with the parent.' In psychotherapy the counselor makes a kind of "trial identification" with the patient and often the patient tends to emulate the therapist. Psychoanalytic treatment actually involves a kind of relationship that is analogous to a parent-child union. The psychologist Carl R. Rogers offers a non-technical paraphrase of the related processes of empathy and identification: The counselor says in effect, "To be of assistance to you I will put aside myself — the self of ordinary interaction — and enter into your world of perception as completely as I am able."10 It is clear that the psychotherapist tries to make himself like the patient and achieves this kind of identification by sharing the quality and mood of the feelings of that person. But this kind of sharing is something less than a complete participation in the plight of another; it is provisional; it stops short of the feeling often described as "sympathy" which involves becoming encumbered by the problems of the patient and personally caught up in his feelings. Identification, as used in psychoanalytic psychology, is therefore a "trial" or a temporary mode in which the therapist does not completely lose his individuality. Max Scheler believed that men are endowed with an autonomous capacity for empathy but at the same time are often prone to a kind of "dissolution of the self."" Scheler described a kind 66 Cf. D. R.

KATZ [4] of "genuine pity" and a "true fellow feeling" in which one man can understand and appreciate the feelings of another without becoming an actual participant in those feelings. According to Robert Fliess, the source of the psychologist's skill lies .... essentially on his ability to put himself in the latter's place, to step into his shoes, and to obtain in this way an inside knowl edge that is almost first-hand. The common name for such a procedure is 'empathy'; and we, as a suitable term for it in our own nomenclature, should like to suggest calling it trial iden tifi cation.12tifi cation.12tifi cation.12 The essential elements of empathy, in sum, involve a sharing of feelings and of ideas, a process of making oneself "like" another ("identification"), a mode of intimate and sensitive communication. In our Jewish sources we do not find these concepts and processes described so explicity. We must infer the traditional understanding of empathy from a very great variety of aphorisms concerning human relations and anthropomorphic figures which portray the quality of God's concern for man and the ways in which God identifies with the human situation. Illustrations of God's anthropopathy form the basis of our inferences. The psychology of religion cannot make judgments concerning theology; its proper concern is the understand ing of the human motivation which prompted the description of God's ways. The ascription of empathy to God therefore signifies the placing of a high value on empathy in human beings. Before examining a number of anthropomorphisms which describe phenomena closely related to "fellow feeling" and "identification" as these concepts are understood in modern psychotherapy, we note a number of references in the tradition to empathy between man and man. Most familiar is of course the statement in Aboth 2.5: "Do not judge thy fellow man until you have come unto his place." A paraphrase in modern ethical and theological language is Leo Baeck's statement: To place oneself in the position of our neighbor, to understand his hope and his yearning, to grasp the need of his heart, is the presupposition of all neighborly love, the outcome of our "knowl edge" of his soul.15 " R.

The Rabbis comment on the value of a true companion with whom one can share a variety of experiences and in whom one can confide without reservation.14 In Aboth 5.16 we are reminded that a disin terested concern is the characteristic of true friendship; the mutuality of relationship between David and Jonathan is held to be exemplary. Job was hardly impressed with the empathie understanding of his friends and rejected their ministrations. They were מנחמי עמל, "futile counselors."IS The Rabbis, however, endowed Job's friends with the attribute of empathy. When absent from their friend, they sought to divine his mood and maintain a form of communication with him. This they accomplished by carrying with them at all times two symbols or indices of Job's emotional state: a plant (flower?) whose condition or appearance was attuned to Job's feelings and a crown containing a portrait of their friend which altered simulta neously with any alteration in Job's condition.16 King David's iden tification with the slain Absalom is movingly portrayed in the Biblical text.17 The value of empathy is also demonstrated in the relationship of Moses to his people. Commenting on the text "he looked upon their burdens" the Rabbis noted that Moses participated in the sufferings of his brothers.18 Like David, Moses wanted to die for those whom he loved. The messiah, we are informed, identifies himself with the unfortunate, for while waiting in Rome for the redemption, he sits among the poor and the suffering.19 The two men who went about the marketplace bringing cheer to the despondent were promised eternal life by Elijah in recognition of their empathie feelings.20 The Rabbis observed that fellow feeling is common to those who can identify with each other because of some similarity of fate or of experience; a loving relationship prevails among strangers, slaves, and ravens — all of whom suffer from ostracism.21 Their marginality makes them sensitive to one another. It is also noted that an iden tification of feeling and of destiny is shared by members of well-knit and intimate groups. When a single member of a group is distressed, '4,יי A both d'Rabbi Nathan, Ch. 8: ויגלה לו כל סתריו סתרי תורה וסתרי דרך ארץ.

KATZ [6] the entire group is affected like the arch which collapses when a single capstone is removed.22 The interdependence of the Jews is a theme reiterated by the masters of the Aggada. When one Jew sins, the consequences are immediately felt by all his brothers.23 An analogy is drawn with the sheep; pain in one limb is felt by the other limbs. So it is with Israel; when one Jew suffers other Jews are correspond ingly affected.24 Another reference points to the sensitive feeling and care which should characterize the attitude of one who performs the command ment of visiting the sick; one is admonished to love his friend as deeply as he loves himself.25 In reference to Prov. 12.25, one Rabbi concludes that it is well to speak of one's sorrow and communicate it to others who presumably will respond with understanding.2" Intimations of empathy are conveyed in the numerous sources treat ing the commandments of visiting the sick, comforting the bereaved, giving hospitality to strangers, and interacting sympathetically with members of one's family. It is in the many descriptions of God's relation to Israel and to man that we find the most noteworthy analogies to empathy and identification as used in modern psychotherapy. The context and the language are anything but psychological in form and style. The human reality and the emotional states that can be deduced from anthropomorphic passages in the Bible and in the Aggada parallel the data of human relationships that have recently been studied by modern psychologists. It is of course our psychological understanding of the authors of this literature that may be illumined rather than our conception of the Deity. When the Rabbis used the term השוה ("He made himself like or equal to"), they had in mind the psychological process designated by "identification." They may not have used the term with any conscious awareness of the structure of the psychological relationship, for they were not concerned with the reflective examination of such inner processes. In using this and similar terms they were expressing human needs and aspirations; the reality of the emotional life of man is of a piece even though the worlds of the Rabbis and of the secular psychologists of our day are so fundamentally different. The word שוה in the Biblical Hebrew often designates a state of 22 Genesis Rabba, Ch. 100: .את נוטל ממנה אבן אחת וכולה מתרועעת נ' Exodus Rabba, Ch. 27. 24 Leviticus Rabba, Ch. 4. 25 Ibid., Ch. 34. 6י Y orna 75a.</page><page sequence="7">[7] EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN AGGADA 197 similarity or identity. A not uncommon usage of the term by the Rabbis of the Aggada is השוה הקדוש ברוך הוא עצמו עם ("the Lord Blessed be He identified Himself or made Himself similar to . . .").27 The term is also used to designate the process of arriving at a state of concord (28.(הומוניא In any case the Rabbis employed the concept of שוה as they ascribed human emotions to God and projected human needs on a cosmic scale. They often took care to add כביכול ("as though it were possible") to temper the boldness of such anthropomor phic language.35 The Rabbis reflected the aspirations of their con tern poraries for a feeling of intimacy and security in their relationship to God and in His immanent presence. The people sought consolation in the assurance that their fate was keenly appreciated by the Divine Spirit. They believed that God had fellow-feeling for His people; they even imagined that God participated directly in their suffering. In his study of the Immanence of God, J. Abelson described the phenomenon to which we propose to apply certain psychological categories of interpretation: Thus, the Rabbinic Jew said that God was his ever constant and never failing redeemer — and he said it because he felt it; he felt that there was a Presence about him which overflowed with unmeasured love for him and his people. It was some such rooted conviction as this, which made him declare that the ShechinahShechinah accompanied his people in all their pilgrimmages, that the Shechinah sustains the sick, that an injury done to a fellow Israelite is an injury done to the Shechinah, that the Shechinah abides in Israel even in the latter's impurity.30 Samuel S. Cohon has dealt at length with the literature concerning God's love.31 Somewhat closer to our theme is Sheldon H. Blank's discussion, based on a study of Hosea, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, of the prophetic conception of God's "entanglement in the human situation." Blank writes somewhat tentatively: זנ Tanchuma (Buber) 42b, וירא. Here the association is with the humble, .עם לבבות הנמוכים 8ג Mechilta on Yithro, section 1.

KATZ [8] As a matter of fact, from several bits of related material, a kind of pattern emerges and it seems possible, quite within the area of Old Testament religion, to speak of a theme of human self-pity matched by divine suffering.32 God's involvement with man is described in Blank's words as "the high tragedy of God's own hurt." Moritz Lazarus quite directly and without qualification noted the persistence of a related theme in the post-Biblical literature: According to Rabbinical interpretations, the poet entertained the bold conception that God desires to be united with man in his suffering, desires to suffer with him.33 To document some of the Rabbinic conceptions of empathy we turn to the comments made in the sources on a number of Biblical passages. We must place ourselves in the Rabbinic frame of reference. Diverse insights and psychological observations are suggested by their associations to two verses in particular, to Psalms 91.15, "I will be with him in trouble" and to Isaiah 63.9, "In all their afflictions He was afflicted." These verses were popular with the Rabbis in their homilies on the theme of God's identification with His children. This is poetry rather than forthright, "scientific" psychology; the phe nomena of the emotional life nevertheless form the data for the associations of the Rabbis and provide us with the most likely material for our comparative analysis of Judaism and dynamic psychology. A major theme is the "Divine Spirit in Exile." Also present was the idea that God participated in the fate of Israel to the extent of joining them when they were to be found in a state of defilement and degradation. So strong was the conviction that God both understood human suffering and shared in it that He was portrayed as a "partner in sorrow." God is described as speaking to Moses in the midst of the uncomfortable thorn bush, a symbol of pain. Of His relationship to Israel, God says: "I am, as it were, a partner in their sorrow."34 The Divine Spirit is enslaved whenever Israel is enslaved, and only when Israel returns from exile will the Divine Spirit be liberated.35 God accompanies Israel in every dispersion in order that He may be 32" S.

He is the husband, the father, and the mother and the sorrow of His family is His own sorrow.3' The Rabbis repeat the Isaianic theme of God as the maternal comforter.40 The relationship is no less intimate than that of twins; when one suffers, the other feels pain at the same moment.41 The aggadicaggadic materials we are considering led Solomon Schechter to use the phrase imitatio hominis to epitomize Rabbinic ascriptions of human emotions to God. God was held to be more accessible to man being endowed with the quality of empathy.44 Another evidence of the tendency to humanize God was the metaphor of the Deity weeping for His people. The Divine Spirit sheds tears over the destruction of the Temple,43 for the captivity of Israel,44 and for their lost glory.45 Whenever He thinks of His suffering children, "He clasps His hands together and groans with anguish."46 A most explicit form of iden tification is described by Rabbi Meir. A psychosomatic symptom (heaviness of limbs) is attributed to the Deity at the moment when He identifies with the man who is destined for suffering.47 He has a private chamber to which He retires when overcome with grief for His children.48 It is notable that according to the Rabbinic conception of God's empathy, the evil-doers and the enemies of Israel were not excluded נ&lt; Megillah 29a. 3י Ibid. 38 Ibid. 3י S.

KATZ [10] from God's solicitude.4' He mourns for seven days for the world He is soon to destroy with the great flood.50 Weeping is frequently ascribed to God and to the angels.51 The Divine Spirit does not hesitate to accompany Israel even in their defilement, say the Rabbis in com menting on Lev. 16.16.52 When the heavenly angels are reluctant to perform the commandment of visiting the sick in the case of Abraham who was convalescing following his circumcision, God rebukes them for their aloofness and precedes them into a place of blood and impu rity.53 When there is no one minded to comfort the mamzer seemingly destined for ostracism, God takes it to be His duty to console him.54 God is consistently identified with the persecuted, even when the tables are turned and the evil-doers are pursued by the righteous.55 He does not hesitate to dwell among the rebellious ones.56 He delights even in the creatures whom man rejects.57 The persecuted and the harassed fowl are acceptable on God's altar.58 He has a special concern for helpless children whom He accompanies into exile.59 He is so attached to the cause of the poor that He stands by their side.60 From the very first day of creation, God was animated by a passion to dwell with His creatures on earth.61 When the angels remonstrated with God for what seemed to be a degradation of divine dignity, God replies: "See how deeply I love the creatures below; I shall descend and dwell beneath the hair of a goat (in man's goatskin tents)."62 God does not keep His distance from His people but marches directly in front of them in a manner unlike earthly princes who require their attendants to precede them as a protection against danger to themselves.63 God is more concerned with the honor of ■יי Sanhédrin 39b.

The analogy is also made between</page><page sequence="11">[11] EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN AGGADA 201 the righteous than He is with His own honor.64 God's empathy is not inhibited or restricted in any way. He calls Israel "His intimates" even though they had the status of Egyptian slaves; unlike men who are loath to acknowledge kin who have been jailed, God does not abandon His own.'5 God's humility is conveyed by the act of descend ing to dwell on the lowly and modest mountain of Sinai. He is ready to serve as a Porter for Israel. He will carry their burdens if they will but unload the weight of their sins upon Him.66 While God's omnipotence was not questioned, He was described as being indecisive and almost ambivalent because of His identifica tion with man. God struggled to overcome a conflict within Himself, as it were, for He prayed that one of His attributes would prove more persuasive than the other; He wanted His attribute of mercy to triumph over His wrath.67 To the Rabbis it was not entirely fantastic to conceive of God as struggling to achieve and maintain an empathie relationship with His creatures. To say that God prays in order to become more merciful is to place the highest value on the quality of empathy in human relationships. God is portrayed as engaged in entreating Himself to make it possible for His own will to be fulfilled : "May it be My will that My children accomplish My will."68 God reveals to man the very order and text of the prayers which are likely to move Him to forgiveness.69 So impatient is He to meet the needs of man that He answers prayers even before they are pronounced.70 The very sources which support the conception of an identity of feeling between God and Israel also suggest that God's own salvation is contingent upon the salvation of Israel. There was no question of God's omnipotence. It was more a matter of emphasizing by so radical and bold a conception that God was intimately involved in the fate of man and would never disassociate Himself from his des tiny. Such a conception of God brought home to the Rabbis and their contemporaries the infinite confidence that they would never be abandoned. God would not permit Himself to be redeemed without redeeming His people at the same time. The Rabbis therefore ex pounded the idea that God awaits the hour of redemption so that God's love and that of the self-sacrificing eagle which places itself between danger and its offspring (Mechilta, Yithro.). 4יי Pesikta d'Rab Kahana, חס הקב'ה על כבודם של צדיקים יותר מכבודו :תצא. *5 Midrash on Ps. 148.14■ 64 Midrash on Ps. 22.8: גולו עונותיכם ואנא טעין. 4ל Berachot 7a. 48 Midrash to Psalm 76. 4י Rosh Hashanah 17b. 70 Exodus Rabba, Ch. 21.

KATZ [12] He may return, with Israel, from the dispersion.71 When He redeems His children, He will redeem His own right hand.72 God proclaims that when certain conditions are fulfilled (study of Torah, practice of lovingkindness, public worship) the reward will be as great as though one had redeemed Him and His children from among the nations of the world.73 Among the words used in connection with the redemption of the Divine Spirit are גאל ,פדה, and ישע. Until such time as God may redeem Israel and Himself, He begs Israel to comfort Him.74 The God who redeems is also the God who suffers. It is clear that in the Rabbinic concept of empathy, fellow feeling involves participation in suffering. II.II. The Ethics of Empathy What are the moral, ethical, and religious principles invoked to establish empathy as a value in human relations from the stand points of Judaism and of modern psychotherapy? Modern psy chotherapy tends to take for granted the function of empathy in the given task of healing the sick. Judaism is more concerned with the fuller range of the relations of man to man and empathy is seen as part of the Divine plan for the very structure of the social order. What is of pivotal importance in our concern with the comparative ethics of empathy in Judaism and psychology is the value placed on the individual and his needs. In one instance both the religious tradi tion and the modern psychotherapist speak of the concept of helping the individual emerge as if he were being assisted in his very birth as a man. The Rabbis spoke of the merit of one who teaches the individual as much as one chapter of the Torah or who brings one soul under the influence of Judaism; it is as though he, the teacher, had been the very creator of that individual.75 Although the concept of Rollo May, a contemporary psychotherapist, is not altogether identical, it is similar and the figure of speech he uses is close to the style of the Rabbis: The therapist is what Socrates named the 'midwife' — com pletely real in being there but being there with the specific purpose 1ל Megillah 29b. נל Pesikta d'Rab Kahana (Buber) 131b: לקץ הימים או לקץ אותו הימין שהיתה משעבדת נאלחי גני נאלתי ימיני. 3ל Berachot 8a: .מעלה אני עליו כאילו פדאני לי ולבני מבין אומות העולם ל»ל« Pesikta d'Rab Kahana 116a: .מי צריך להנחם לא אני 5ל Yalkut Eliezer (Pressburg, תרכד), section "Master and Pupil." The refrain in each of the two statements is: כאלו יצרו וריקמו והביאו לעולם.</page><page sequence="13">[13] EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN AGGADA 203 of helping the other person bring to birth something within himself.76 Psychotherapy is an expression in the main of modern medical sicence and derives its ethics from the professional code of the medical practitioner, which is almost entirely secular even though its roots might be traced back to a classic concern for the individual. Our study would be unduly extended were we to comment on the aspects of the history of psychoanalysis which exhibits characteristics of a "church" as well as a "political movement" with its "congresses" and its succession of leaders.77 Empathy as a mode of communication and as a vital process in therapy came into psychological usage in the course of scientific experimentation. It was a functional instrument and was esteemed because of its usefulness in enhancing the healing process. Nearly all of the leading theorists and psychologists were secular scientists; their ethics derived from a love of science and from considerations loosely classified as humanitarian. Because of the obvious inadequacy of traditional methods of psychotherapy which involved the use of drugs and the manipulation of the envi ronment, the therapist was moved to experiment with a new kind of relationship to the patient in which empathy was discovered to be a most significant ingredient. The so-called "talking cure" involved a meeting and an encounter between two personalities, the healer and the patient. In the course of the refinement of the psychotherapeutic process, Freud and his followers were led to the most sensitive explora tion on both the conscious and unconscious levels of the modes of communication between two people. This new line of psychological investigation tended to close the era of mechanistic and manipulative medicine with its emphasis on the treatment of the body or of one of the organs of the body. Now that the physician was concerned with the psyche of man and with the diverse relationships which evolve 6י This statement by Rollo May is found on p. 84 of Existence, A New Dimen sion in Psychiatry and Psychology, (Edited by Rollo May, Ernest Angel, and Henri F. Ellenberger), N. Y., Basic Books, 1958. " One characterization of the Freudian School as a kind of church with an almost hierarchical organization is briefly suggested by Max Graf in his article "Reminiscences of Professor Sigmund Freud," The Psychoanalytic Quarterly, Vol. XI, No. 2, 1942. E. Fromm makes the point in his biographical study Sigmund Freud's Freud's Mission, N. Y., Harpers, 1959. He uses the term "quasi-religious movement" and devotes a chapter to the "quasi-political character of the psychoanalytic move ment." According to Fromm, Freud had a sense of "mission" even though he re pressed his wish to have psychoanalysis serve as a "new philosophical-scientific religion." However, Fromm adds, "The content of this faith remained always implicit" (p. 92).</page><page sequence="14">204 ROBERT L. KATZ [14] in the meeting of the personalities of healer and patient, he was led into a relatively new field of medical interest, one which brought him closer to problems of human relations that had long concerned those who were teachers and cultivators of the religious tradition. Empathy is therefore a concept that links psychotherapy and religion. It is rare, however, to note among the psychologists of the psy choanalytic school any expression of ethical principles couched in language similar to the symbols and principles associated with the religious tradition. A therapeutic philosophy like that of the psy choanalyst, Izette de Forest who directly refers to Lev. 19.18 is unusual. One of the leading exponents of psychoanalysis was Sandor Ferenczi who was noted for differing from his master, Freud, in emphasizing an active love for the patient.78 But Ferenczi, like Freud, derived his ethic and his practice from a process of exper imentation rather than from a philosophic or ethical code with a transcendental rationale. Interesting for our comparative study is the view of Alfred Adler on the ethics of empathy. He concluded that the physician could proceed on the basis of the useful fiction, fol lowing the "as-if" philosophy of Hans Vaihinger.7' It was Fromm who wrote most explicitly about the ethics of empathy. In his system empathy is derived from man's innate care and responsibility for his fellow man, from respect for one's brother and from dedication to a concept of reality and truth which reflects the inner character of man.80 Fromm uses the term "love" rather than "empathy" and stresses the principle that the psychotherapist must relate himself 8ל This is a prominent theme in The Leaven of Love, A Development of the Psy choanalyticchoanalytic Theory and Technique of Sandor Ferenczi by Izette de Forest, N. Y., Harpers, 1954. According to this point of view the psychotherapist must sometimes take the role of a parental substitute. "This demands an embracing atmosphere of "lovingkindness." (p. 123). There is movement from empathie examination to "the final 'give and take' with the patient, as a person of equal emotional vigor." ל' Alfred Adler, op. cit., Ch. Three, "Fictionalism and Finalism." Speaking of his "school" of Individual Psychology, Adler wrote: "It will be satisfied in the practical application of its science to protect and further the sacred good of brotherly love where the religions have lost their influence" (p. 463). Another statement is of interest in line with note 77 and the idea of ethical "movements" in psychology: "I have always endeavored to show that Individual Psychology is the heir to all great movements whose aim is the welfare of mankind" (p. 463). 80 E. Fromm, The Art of Loving, N. Y., Harpers, 1956. Space does not permit the delineation of some of the newer concepts in psychotherapy of the therapist patient relationship with the emphasis on the reality of the encounter. I hope other installments in this study will permit the discussion of the ideas outlined in "Healing as Participation" by Hanna Colm, Psychiatry, Vol. 16, pp. 199-211, 1953. Dr. Colm deals with the implications of Tillich's theology for psychotherapy.</page><page sequence="15">[15] EMPATHY IN MODERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IN AGGADA 205 to the patient as a real person, as one who cares, who is alive and sensitive, and who is committed to the purpose of helping one's fellow realize his potentialities. Knowledge of one's fellow ultimately depends on the capacity for love: The only way of full knowledge lies in the act of love: this act transcends thought, it transcends words.81 Because of an orientation to psychotherapy that diverged somewhat from that held by the so-called "classic Freudians," Fromm criticized a certain reluctance of therapists to move beyond the earlier concep tion of detached, scientific observation of the patient and his un conscious with a minimum investment of feeling and concern: "He must not look on the patient as an object, or even be only a 'partie ipant observer.' "82 What may we infer about Freud's conception of the ethics of empathy? He viewed the psychotherapeutic relationship as a means of "securing the best possible psychological conditions for the func tioning of the ego: when this has been done, analysis has accomplished its task."83 There was a minimum of mutuality in the relationship because the psychoanalyst was deliberately to restrict his involvement and to inhibit the development of a personal relationship with the patient. Analysis, according to Freud, should be marked by a kind of privation or a state of abstinence in which a minimum of support or affection should be conveyed to the patient.84 He had in mind less a relationship of mutuality between two persons than a precise mode of treatment by which the "scientist-expert" established communica tion with the source of the illness, the patient's unconscious.Ss What is of more significance for our investigation of the ethics of empathy was the concern of Freud and the psychoanalysts with the principle of truth in the counseling relationship and the requirement of scru pulous soul-searching on the part of the psychotherapist himself. Both patient and physician were to be rigorously committed to a love of truth. According to Freud: 81 Fromm, ibid., p. 80. 82 E. Fromm, "The Limitations of Psychoanalysis" in The Saturday Review, March 16, 1957, p. II. The analyst "must overcome his own alienation, be capable of relating himself to the patient from core to core . . . 88 S. Freud, op. cit., Vol. V, p. 354. 84 S.

Freud recommends a state of "easy and im partial attention," etc., "to catch the drift of the patient's unconscious with his own unconscious."</page><page sequence="16">206 ROBERT L. KATZ [16] we must not forget that the relationship between analyst and patient is based on a love of truth, that is, on the acknowl edgement of reality, and that it precludes any kind of sham or deception.86 In order to qualify for his delicate responsibility, the psychoanalyst must strive to eliminate or control those forces within himself that might blind him to certain sides of reality and block his most effective communication with the patient. The process of gaining self-insight is called "training analysis" and while entirely secular in form and far from identical with conventional religious modes of "soul searching" or confessional, it is nevertheless grounded on a thorough going respect for truth and entails an openness of relationship that is reminiscent of a form of spiritual apprenticeship. Ferenczi described analysis as a process of gaining ethical insight as a prerequisite for entering into profound and empathie relationships with another person : .... the analyst himself, on whom the fate of so many other people depends, must know and be in control of even the most recondite weaknesses of his own character . . . .8? Related to our theme also is the concept of "moral courage," an ethical quality which Theodor Reik considered essential if the patient and the counselor were to persevere in their mutual search for elusive and disquieting knowledge.88 As the following statement by Izette de Forest indicates, the ethics of empathy depends not only on the commitments of the therapist but more importantly on the kind of person he is: Whatever the psychotherapist may accomplish with his patient, he accomplishes because of who and what he is. His skill, his empathie capacity, his originality of theory and practice, are the expressions of his integrated, self-controlled, and ripened per sonality.89 In J udaism the sources for the ethics of empathy are to be derived 86 S.

Empathy may be seen as a moral and practical quality which is demanded of the individual in his human relations by an omnipotent God. We shall take note also of the high value which the Jewish sources ascribe to the quality of moral truth and ethical consistency. In its long history the Jewish tradition developed a vast ethical literature, much of which can be said to deal with the category of empathy. Our treatment will be illustrative rather than comprehensive, since our concern is the demonstration of certain linkages between Judaism and psychology rather than a discursion on Jewish ethics in general. The view of empathy as a mandate from a loving but omnipotent God is basic to Judaism. The primary source is the classic statement in Lev. 19.2. It is suggested also by the Divinely ordained stipulation concerning fraternal responsibility.'0 The Biblical view is of course recapitulated in Hillel's Golden Rule.'1 Man is called upon to emulate God who concerns Himself with the welfare of the individual and serves his needs. Empathy is an attribute of God and hence a desideratum desideratum for man who is expected to identify himself with God and His ways.'* Concern for the individual, an expression of empathy, is demonstrated as a moral value when men are reminded of God's infinite attention to certain responsibilities which attend the well being of man. God is present at weddings where He blesses the groom and helps adorn the bride ; He performs the commandments of visiting the sick and burying the dead.'3 The Rabbis specify the implications of the commandment "to follow the Shechinah" — it means to follow in its ways, i. e. to imitate the characteristics and practices of the Holy One Blessed be He, i. e. clothe the naked, visit the sick, console the bereaved and bury the dead.'4 A most explicit illustration of the rationale and ethics of empathy in J udaism is the principle of gemiluth tiasadim,tiasadim, the performance of which is the profession or métier of God ; Abraham, endowed in Rabbinic Aggada with the virtues of love and fraternal responsibility, is said to have embraced the Divine profes sion.'s Those who were called "workers of good deeds," גומלי המדים, were described as cleaving to the covenant of "Abraham our father."'6 י° Gen. 4-9! and 9-5b. 91 Shabbat 31a. 91 Shabbat91 Shabbat 133b.

The passages dealing with the counseling of the bereaved are most sensitive.</page><page sequence="18">208 ROBERT L. KATZ [18] The ethics of Rabbinic counseling reflected the basic theme of גמילות חסדים. Commenting on Ex. 18.20 the Rabbis interpreted the phrase את הדרך as גמילות חסדים and held that the phrase ילכו should be taken as a reference to visiting the sick." One's responsibility to his fellow man was not limited to financial support. The practice of גמילות חסדים was considered more meritorious than צדקה because it involved not only a giving of material things but a giving of oneself, of one's care and loving concern. Rashi interpreted the giving of oneself as referring specifically to such helpful acts as mourning for the dead and burying them, rejoicing with the groom, and accom panying one's friend on his journey.98 The same thought is echoed in the Rabbinic teaching that one who has nothing material to give his needy friend should console him with sympathetic words.99 Moreover, the counsel and support one gives to his friend should be characterized by invocation of God's word and His spirit; counsel illumined by the Divine Spirit would have abiding worth.100 The greeting and encounter which takes place between man and man has the highest ethical significance, for when one welcomes a fellow-man, it is accounted to one's merit as though he had welcomed (or beheld) the face of the Shechinah.101 Shechinah.101 Recalling that empathy entails a concern for the welfare of the individual and a concern for understanding him in his uniqueness and individuality, it is interesting to note the stress which is laid on the worth of a single life. In the well-known Mishnaic statement, it is said that to him who saves a single life it is accounted as though he had saved the totality of mankind.102 The devotion to a single individual and the unusual concentration of effort on his emotional rehabilitation has been an outstanding characteristic of psy choanalytic practice. Fromm had ethical considerations in mind in paying tribute to Freud's ascription of such merit to the task of helping one individual for what is often so arduous and prolonged a course of therapy: I believe that there is perhaps no greater evidence of Freud's genius than his counsel to take the time even if it should require many years to help one person to achieve freedom and happiness.103 זי Baba Mezia 30b. 8י Sukkot 49b. .צדקה בממונו גמילות חסדים בין בנופו בין בממונו יי Leviticus Rabba, Ch. 34• 100 Sanhédrin 26b: עצה שיש בה דבר ה' היא תקום לעולם. 101 Mechilta, Lauterbach, Vol. II, p. 178: .שכל המקבל פני חברו כאלו מקבל פני שכינה נ°' Sanhédrin 4.5• 103 E.

Relevant to the ethics of empathy in Judaism would be the numerous admonitions regarding the commandment of visiting the sick and the assertion that one's love for his ailing friend should be as profound as is his own self-love.104 Empathie concern for one's fellow was held to be practically efficacious. A visitor removes a portion of the illness of his sick friend.105 It was recognized by one partner in a debate between two of the Rabbis that it is well to speak of one's own distress in the presence of others.106 The Rabbis stressed most emphatically the role of truth as an essential element in empathie relationships. As a parallel to the value Freud placed on absolute honesty as a prerequisite for both the physician and the patient, we note briefly some Rabbinic references to the virtue of תמימות and כונה. What was asserted as part of one's preparation for the act of prayer could be taken as an endorsement of the virtue of self-analysis; a man was required to take stock of himself and determine whether his heart was attuned to the Divine, i. e., to determine whether he was able to give undivided attention to his religious responsibilities.107 Ethical integrity is of course a frequent theme in the Bible.108 God is portrayed as the seeker after the heart of man.10' He penetrates to the inmost feelings of His children.110 Truth is the seal of God.111 Among the creatures who reap Divine disapproval are those who speak one way and think another way in their hearts.112 In the Jewish tradition and in modern psychotherapy the highest significance is attached to honesty in the relations of man to man. Lack of integrity is but one of the many phenomena which are felt by modern psychotherapists to impede and inhibit the empathie process. Much attention is given to the ways in which projection, rationalization, and narcissism interfere with genuine communication in human relations. It is hard to avoid the ethical implications in evaluating these mental mechanisms; modern therapists concern "4י"4י Leviticus Rabba, Ch. 34. 10s Nedarim 39b. 106 Yoma 75a. 10' Berachot 30b: לעולם יסוד אדם את עצמו אם יכול לכוין את לבו יתפלל ואם לאו אל יתפלל. 108 Ps. 119-1, I Sam. 14-41!

These mental processes were not unnoticed in the Jewish tradition. It is interesting to note some illustrations of ways in which the Rabbis indicated their aware ness of them. They observed that it is hard for one man really to know what is in the heart of his fellow-man."3 Man tends to be self-centered and when his own needs are met, he is less able to muster feelings of sympathy and understanding for the needs of others. The Rabbis noted that a man normally has two hearts, i. e., he has concern for himself and for others. But after he fills his own needs (eating and drinking), he has but one heart, i.e., he has no concern for the needs of others."4 Another reference reminds us of one more consequence of man's egocentricity. It can be presumed that a man will be able to observe the diseases of others. He cannot be trusted, however, to make a reliable count of his own diseases.115 It was noted generally that a man is incapable of seeing anything that will prove disad vantageous to himself."6 The mental mechanism known in modern psychology as "projec tion" was implied in the statement by R. Nathan: "Do not ascribe your defect to your fellow-man.""7 An interesting example of intuitive psychology is afforded in the Rabbinic exposition of the somewhat unusual statement in Deuteronomy 1.27a ("Because the Lord hated us . . ."). The Rabbis observed that God actually had no such negative feelings for Israel and cited as evidence the text in Mai. 1.2 ("I have loved you, saith the Lord"). The psychological reality was clear to the Rabbis: it was obvious that Israel must have hated the Lord. As further demonstration of the psychological process involved, the Rabbis then cited the proverb: When you have a certain attitude (negative, in this case) towards another person, you tend to assume that this same attitude is maintained by the other person vis-à-vis yourself."8 נ" Pesachim 54b• 14י Baba Bathra 12b. "s Negaim 2.5: כל הננעים אדם רואה חוץ סננעי עצמו. 116 Shabbat 119a: ואין אדם רואה חובה לעצמו. 1" Baba Mezia 59b: מום שבך אל תאמר לחברך. Because of their own former mar ginality as strangers in the land of Egypt, they might be prone to offend the proselyte by making him conscious of his minority status. 1,8 Sifre, Deuteronomy, Ch. 24. The psychological process is clearly indicated in the Rabbinical commentary on Deut. 1.27a ("because the Lord hated us"): אפשר שהקב'ה שונא את ישראל והרי כבר נאמר (מלאכי א) אהבתי אתכם אמר ה' אלא הם שונאים את הקב'ה משל הדיוט הוא מה דבלבך על רחפך מה דבלביה עלך.</page><page sequence="21">[21] EMPATHY IN MODERN psychotherapy AND IN AGGADA 211 The Rabbis stressed the need for self-searching as a method of over coming difficulties in understanding and appreciating the situation of one's fellow. Moreover, a man had to practice justice (adorn himself) before demanding it of others."9 The Rabbis observed that if a man cannot be judged himself, how can he be permitted to judge others?120 A Rabbinic equivalent of the more or less universal proverb "physi cian, heal thyself" is available in the statement: 121.רופא רפא חנירתך Suspicions of a lack of disinterestedness on the part of a would-be advisor are frequently justified, according to a warning issued by the Rabbis: 122.אמר רב כהנא משום ר"ע הוי זהיר מן היעצך לפי דרכו. Preparation for counseling entails the process of qualifying oneself to enter into an empathie relationship; part of that qualification is the closest possible examination of one's own character and motivations. Distor tions of insight and residues of inappropriate emotions are a matter of concern in Judaism as well as in modern psychotherapy. Otto Fenichel underscored the value of the training analysis for the therapist as a means of eliminating "his own unresolved love and hate tend encies."123 The Rabbis considered self-mastery and the sublimation of one's passions to be a heroic achievement.124 The process of self searching and self-analysis received a kind of transcendental value in Judaism when the Rabbis asserted that man should examine himself because this is no more than what God practices for Himself: איני 125.מבקש מכם אלא כשם שבלשתי בעצמי ומצאתי י"א מדות III. Empathy as a Relationship With Qualifications One of the most significant developments in modern psychotherapy has been the distinction made between empathy and sympathy, between Einfulhung and Mitleid. We note some allusions to this "י Sanhédrin 18a, 19a; Baba Mezia 107b. קשט עצמך ואחר כך קשט אחריס. Cf. also Baba Baba Bathra 15b: טול קורה מבין עיניך. Sanhédrin 19a. UI Genesis Rabba, Ch. 23. Adam gave advice on procreation at a time when he himself was not fulfilling the commandment. 131 Sanhédrin 76b. As Rashi notes, he gives advice that will redound to his own good. Note also the statement of R. Meir (Moed Katon 21b) about the person who would attempt to offer consolation to a man who has already completed the twelve months of mourning. The analogy is made to a physician who fractures the healed leg of a man so that he can demonstrate the excellence of his medicine and his therapy.

KATZ [22] distinction in the Jewish sources but the differences have been defined more sharply by the psychologists. What is involved is not only the assessment of the actual benefit to the patient of empathy as con trasted with sympathy but also the ethical issue of respect for the individuality of each person in the meeting of two. Communication between representatives of the religious tradition and the modern psychotherapists proves most difficult in this issue. Different schools of psychotherapy are prone to debate the degree to which the therapist should involve himself in a realistic relationship with the patient.126 In any case it is of the essence of modern psychotherapy to recognize the need for the therapist to maintain perspective on the intimacy of his relationship; support may be given to the patient but the absorption of the physician in the problems of the patient is felt to be an impediment rather than an aid to the patient's recovery. The therapist makes a "trial identification," i. e., he makes himself like the patient for a brief period but this is done as part of a therapeutic program and it is not believed that the physician should become as encumbered by the patient's problems as the patient himself.127 The psychotherapist should have insight and control over his own reactions, notes Izette De Forest: This understanding allows him to make right use of his trained and intuitional skill and prevents him from allowing his own personal problems to enter upon the analytic scene.128 Reassurance through the method of offering sympathy and an un inhibited, unqualified identification with the patient are normally excluded from the modern psychotherapeutic process. The ethical aspects of the problem of empathy and sympathy are discussed fully by Max Scheler12' and by Erich Fromm.130 Genuine pity and love involve a relationship based on respect for the individuality of each 126 Psychoanalytic literature on "transference" and "counter-transference." Don D. Jackson observed: "The opprobrious and restricted meaning of counter transference suggests that we may have need for a new term which would include all those processes which make up the sum total of happenings between two people." Article, "Countertransference and Psychotherapy" in Progress in Psychotherapy (edited by F. Fromm-Reichmann and J. L. Moreno), op. cit., p. 230. He holds that a psychotherapist is "reared as a scientist, but, like the artist, the creative aspects of his work cannot be managed by reason alone." 127 Charles D.

Scheler emphasizes the low ethical value as well as the impracticality of commiseration: The dissolution of the self in a common stockpot of misery elim inates genuine pity altogether.131 Attempting to distill the quality of love, Fromm described it as the expression of intimacy between two human beings under the condition of the preservation of each other's integrity.132 The theme of mutuality is also present in the writings of therapists like de Forest.133 Psychotherapy rests on the principle of respect for differences. There is also a kind of reciprocity, for a number of ref erences can be found in the literature to the help and insight which accrue to the physician himself in the process of working for the initial goal, i. e., the therapy of the patient.134 Empathie relationships are therefore not only non-competitive but often tend to be mutualistic and cooperative. In the traditional Jewish sources we find a number of references to the mutual respect that prevails in empathy but in general there is less emphasis on the distinction between empathy and sympathy. A Hebrew equivalent for "mutual respect" might be found in the term חולק כבוד as used in the Rabbinic description of the relationship between Aaron and Moses; one brother gave honor to the other and each added to the other's strength.135 The psychological implications of their relationship are most relevant to a discussion of the non 131 M. Scheler, op. cit., p. 55. This volume is relevant to the interest of students of religion, ethics, and psychology. 132 E. Fromm, The Art of Loving, p. no. In Man for Himself, p. 73, he notes: "The way one experiences others is not different from the way one experiences oneself." 133 Izette de Forest, op. cit., referring to the patient-therapist relationship, she comments that "mutually loving people will rejoice over each other's success." (p. 19). Compare this with the Rabbinic account of the mutuality between Aaron and Moses. Cf. notes 135 and 136. 134 In an unpublished lecture delivered at the Univ. of Cincinnati Medical School (Dept. of Psychiatry) on February 29, 1956, E. Fromm commented on the insight he gained from his patients. Izette de Forest (p. xiv) observed that "in the very process of helping to free the patient's selfhood the therapist too finds self development and self-realization." T. Reik, op. cit., p. 433 wrote: "It is, therefore, legitimate to speak of the psychotherapeutic value to the analyst of the analysis of another person. In beginning to comprehend another, we discover a clue to ourselves.' ' 133 Mechilta (Lauterbach), Vol. I, Masechta d'Pisga, III: משה היה חולק כבוד לאהרון ואסר לו למדני ואהרון היה חולק כבוד למשה ואומר לו למדני והדבור יוצא סכיניהם כאלו שניהס מדברים.</page><page sequence="24">214 ROBERT L. KATZ [24] competitive aspect of empathy. The Rabbis noted the complete absence of competitive feelings; each brother rejoiced in the fulfillment that accrued to the other.136 Some inferences can be drawn also from the qualifications and limits to the empathie relationship of God to man. Illustrations of God's feeling for man and references to His participation in the sorrows of Israel abound but note must also be taken of the implications of the concept of the Transcendence of God. God and man are not fused into one; the Shechinah which associated itself with man and his fate and was deeply sympathetic to man was also described as withdrawing from such intimacy (סילוק שכינה). Relevant here are Biblical passages like Isaiah 55.8 ("for My thoughts are not your thoughts") and Job 38.4 ("where wast thou when I laid the foundation of the earth"). The Rabbinic Aggada which was in so many respects a literature of consolation tended to stress the immanence of God. It was not anticipated that Rabbinic literature would afford illustrations of the distinction between empathy and sympathy in the actual situation of counseling. Notable, however, is the observation of the Rabbis concerning the dangers of "over-identification." There was a recognition that sympathy needs to be controlled. In counseling the bereaved, men should not surpass God as they seek to emulate His attribute of compassion.1" The theme of an identity of feeling and status among two who take counsel together is conveyed in Ps. 55.14. A version of counseling given by the Rabbis in com menting on Lam. 2.13 ". . . what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee . . ." is more in accord with the conventional belief in the efficacy of sym pathy and commiseration than it is with the practice of modern psychotherapists."8 Universalizing and citing analogous situations are felt to be less helpful than the gift of empathie understanding and the fullest acceptance of the individual as the unique person he is. 3}e * * * * * $ I hope to continue this study and in subsequent installments deal with illustrations of empathy in Jewish ethical literature and in Hasidism.

In his "I and Thou" dialogue he defines a relationship in a form that holds interest for the student of Judaism and for the psychologist. Modern psychotherapy has refined the concept of empathy and through several decades of clinical study of human relationships has been able to demonstrate important distinctions between sympathy (Mitleid)(Mitleid)(Mitleid) and empathy (Einfiihlung). In the Rabbinic Aggada the emphasis on the value of fellow-feeling was conveyed most persua sively by materials dealing with the immanence of God. Leo Baeck caught the essence of the Jewish view of empathy when he wrote: To be a man means to be a fellow man. I am to make the man beside me my fellow man by my will and my deed. By my choice and my duty I must make a reality in life what is already reality through God The other man is my fellow because God made him such, and yet my deed is to make him a fellow man to me!
