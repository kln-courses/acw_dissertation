John Yannaccone ARCCA Ine Copyright © 2001 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT There has been very limited research on the biomechanics of occupant safety in the ambulance environment. Occupant protection or crash testing safety standards for these unique vehicles are lacking in the United States. Recent studies have identified ambulances as high risk passenger transport vehicles. This study was conducted to identify some of the occupant safety hazards in the ambulance environment and to determine the efficacy of some countermeasures to mitigate ambulance occupant injury. Accelerator sled testing of the ambulance rear patient compartment (ambulance box or rear cabin) with Anthropomorphic Test Devices was conducted under frontal impact conditions with a target sled pulse was 26 G and 30 mph. The ambulance box was configured with instrumented and uninstrumented Anthropomorphic Test Devices positioned as in the real world environment. Two uninstrumented 95% Hybrid-ll Anthropomorphic Test Devices were lap belted and positioned in the occupant compartment, one on the rear-facing attendant's seat and one on the side-facing bench seat. A Side Impact Dummy was unbelted, seated on the front of the side- facing bench seat and positioned next to a passive restraint device. An instrumented Hybrid-Ill 3 year old child Anthropomorphic Test Device was restrained in a child restraint system, secured to the gurney via a dual belt path. The actual sled pulse achieved was 34Gs and 34.34 mph, and due to separation of the ambulance box from the chassis/sled, the crash pulse imparted to the patient compartment were 20Gs and 20.9 mph. Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values calculated for the restrained Hybrid-Ill child Anthropomorphic Test Device were 171, however for the unbelted Side Impact Dummy the HIC was projected to be in excess of 1000. Although this study was a preliminary study, the findings confirmed that there are unique occupant hazards in the ambulance vehicle environment and that certain restraint practices are of value and that some injury mitigating countermeasures are ineffective. Importantly this study also demonstrated the potential for unrestrained occupants to be not only a hazard to themselves but also a hazard to the restrained occupants in the ambulance patient compartment. This study highlights the need for the development of dynamic safety standards for occupant restraint in this environment. INTRODUCTION In contrast to comprehensive research and development focus on occupant protection in passenger vehicles by the automotive safety industry, the occupant safety of ambulance vehicles, specifically the patient compartment, has not yet been addressed by the automotive safety paradigm. There has been very limited research on the biomechanics of occupant safety in the ambulance environment 1,2 There are no published studies on ambulance vehicle or complete patient compartment sled or crash tests. Although the data are limited, ambulances in the United States have high crash and fatality rates per mile traveled 3'4'5. There are estimated 50 fatalities per year, with a quarter of these fatalities being occupants in the ambulance vehicle 6. The injury rates are estimated to be 60 fold higher than the fatality rates. Ambulance vehicles are unique vehicles in that they are constructed from a standard truck chassis, with an after market custom box secured as the patient compartment. There are a number of different types of vehicles, Type I and Type III being modified trucks and Type II, a modified van. Vehicles of the truck type tested in this test have a gross vehicle weight of approximately 14,050 pounds. Dynamic safety standards for testing occupant or equipment restraint systems in the ambulance patient compartment are lacking in the United States. The only formal standards 1329</page><page sequence="2">are purchase specifications, not performance specifications, (the 'KKK-D' Star of Life specifications 7). A consensus panel assembled by the Emergency Medical Services for Children and the National Highway Traffic Safety administration recently developed preliminary guidelines for safe ambulance transport of children . Australia has had longstanding safety standards for the air transport of patients and crew , however it was not until 1999 that Australia 10 and Europe11 have each developed some safety standards for occupant protection for ground ambulance vehicles. The objective of this study is to conduct and analyze sled tests of occupant kinematics and forces generated under crash circumstances in the ambulance patient compartment, and also to test some injury mitigating countermeasures for adult occupants and a pediatric simulated patient. TESTING METHODS Test Setup: One frontal impact test of the rear patient compartment of a 1999 553B ambulance box (figure 1) manufactured by a major ambulance manufacturer was conducted at the Transportation Research Center (TRC) in East Liberty, Ohio. The primary purpose of the sled test was an industry initiative to analyze the mounting mechanism of the rear patient compartment to the chassis and also to assess a new gurney and a new method of gurney mounting. The primary purpose of this test was a manufacturers performance evaluation of structural features of the ambulance box and attachments. The research teams involvement in this test was a secondary purpose and a largely fortuitous opportunity. The research team elected to place instrumented and uninstrumented Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) in the rear patient compartment. It was also elected by the combined industry and research team to assess the performance of a passive crew restraint. Overall this test was performed to evaluate the performance of : • The attachment hardware for mounting this ambulance body to a vehicle chassis • A newly developed gurney and gurney hold downs • A newly designed passive crew restraint on the front end of the right-side squad bench • The attachment of a representative child restraint to the gurney • The performance (HIC and Chest G's) of a child Hybrid III ATD in an FMVSS 213 approved child safety seat secured onto the gurney. • Evaluation of kinematics of 2 uninstrumented 95%ile ATDs, and kinematics and electronic data of a Side Impact Dummy (SID) The test setup consisted of the ambulance box with standard 553B layout with left-side wall "B" cabinet layout. The box was equipped with the newly designed center mounted stretcher retention device. A model 93S stretcher was installed in the ambulance box. Inside the box were four ATDs. Their seating positions and method of restraint was as follows: • The three year-old Hybrid-Ill (H-lll) child ATD was positioned in a standard passenger vehicle convertible child restraint seat (CRS) with a standard five-point harness. This safety seat was attached to the stretcher with 2 standard patient restraint belts. The belts were oriented in the horizontal and vertical planes, the horizontal belt passing through the rear back construction of the child safety seat, and the vertically oriented belt passing through a belt path over the front of the seat under the thighs of the ATD. (Figure 2) • The 50th percentile male Side Impact Dummy (SID) was unrestrained and seated at the forward end of the squad bench. This is side facing position which was equipped with the passive restraint device (Figure 1) • A 95th percentile male Hybrid-ll ATD (un- instrumented) was restrained in the rear most position of the squad bench, a side facing position and was restrained with the lap belt normally fitted to the vehicle (Figure 1 ) • A 95th percentile male Hybrid-ll (un-instrumented) was positioned in the rear-facing attendant's seat (Captains Chair) and was restrained with the lap belt normally fitted to the vehicle. All of the ATDs were seated in the upright position pre- test. Belt tension on the two belts restraining the child safety seat to the stretcher were greater than 15 pounds. The lap belt tension on the rear-facing Hybrid-ll was one pound and on the side-facing Hybrid-ll the tension was five pounds. The SID was equipped with head, upper and lower rib, upper and lower spine, and pelvis accelerometers. In addition, the SID had a six-axis neck load cell installed for this test. The three year-old H-lll child ATD had head, chest, and pelvis accelerometers, and a chest potentiometer. Data were acquired in accordance with SAE J211. Eight high-speed film cameras were used to record the test. All cameras were run at 1000 frames per second. The views of each camera are summarized in table 1 . 1330</page><page sequence="3">This test was conducted on the 24 inch HYGE test sled located at the Transportation Research Center in East Liberty, Ohio. There was no data to verify which was the ideal test pin to use to generate a crash pulse which was an accurate representation of the crash pulse for the current chassis on which the ambulance box is mounted. Without any information to make an informed decision to change the pulse, the decision was made to use the same pulse that was used in a similar test in 1991 for the test conducted in this study. Both the 1999 and 1991 tests used TRC metering pin # 8. The target sled pulse was 26 G and 30 mph which was approximately the pulse used by the 1991 sled test at TRC. RESULTS Ambulance Box Parameters: The ambulance box separated from the sled during the test prior to 35 milliseconds. Due to this separation of the ambulance box from the sled, the required sled pulse parameters were not met. The resultant peak acceleration of the sled was 34.3 G's, which overshot the target of 26 G's by approximately 32%. The peak velocity for the sled was 34.34 mph, 14% greater then the target of 30 mph. The overshoot was due to the effect of losing the mass of the ambulance box when it separated from the sled. The HYGE accelerator imparts a force on the sled which is equal to the product of the sled system mass and the sled acceleration. The loss of ambulance box and occupant mass from the system resulted in the increased sled acceleration, thereby increasing the velocity of the sled, but not the ambulance box. The lower ambulance box acceleration appears to have reached approximately 20 G's during the test. The peak velocity achieved by the lower and upper box, prior to loss of data, were 20.9 and 13.3 mph, respectively. The data plots show that the lower ambulance box and sled acceleration profiles start to deviate from one another early in the test, at approximately 10 milliseconds, ignoring the slight lag between the sled and the lower box. At this point the sled begins to accelerate faster than the lower ambulance box, resulting in the box traveling slower than the sled. Following this, the box acceleration exceeds that of the sled. Between 20 and 30 milliseconds the sled and ambulance box acceleration begin to match up, indicating the sled and lower ambulance box are again coupled. At approximately 35 milliseconds the separation between the sled and the ambulance box traces significantly increases, and it is apparent that the sled and the ambulance box were no longer coupled. Sled accelerations at this point are little more than 20 G's, and its velocity was approximately 10 mph. Six of the 10 coupling bolts, securing the ambulance box to the sled/chassis, fractured on impact, allowing this separation of the ambulance box and sled/chassis to occur. Due to the separation of the sled and the box, some data channels were compromised. This resulted in a loss of data from the following channels: SID head X acceleration (lost at 76 milliseconds) and Z acceleration (lost at 55 milliseconds), SID lower spine Y acceleration (lost at 82 milliseconds), upper and lower ambulance box accelerations were both lost at 62 milliseconds. Loss of these channels for the SID prevented the resultant accelerations from being calculated. Without the head resultant acceleration, the HIC for the SID could not be calculated. Occupant Kinematics: After impact, the ATDs which were restrained, remained in approximately their pre-test positions (figure 3). The unrestrained SID impacted and fragmented the passive restraint device. This device failed to restrain the SID, which then became airborne and had 2 head impacts. The initial head impact was into the bulkhead cabinet, the second was into the angle between the floor and the rear upright section of the stretcher. The HIC was projected to be greater than 1000, due to the high velocity impact of head into a rigid surface. The SID's final rest position was lying forward of its initial position, near the top of the stretcher, with the head within the structure of the stretcher. The H-lll child ATD is also in approximately the same position pre and post-test and demonstrated minimal motion during crash event. The HIC recorded from the restrained child ATD was 171. A ceiling light fixture and its fluorescent tube, which separated from the ceiling during the test, contacted with the child ATD's head. The side facing ATD remained restrained, however kinematic analysis demonstrated that the upper body rotated laterally 90 degrees to the horizontal position with some excursion of the pelvis. The rear facing ATD demonstrated minimal motion, and appeared fully supported by the seat back throughout the crash event. This occupant appears to be in approximately the same position pre and post-test, though the ATD is shifted slightly forward Occupant Protection: Only two of the four ATDs used in this testing were instrumented to allow ATD response parameters to be recorded. The only standard calculated values, such as Head Injury Criteria (HIC) and Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI), that have been supplied to us to aid in accessing the results of this test is the HIC for the child ATD. This was calculated using a 36 milliseconds maximum duration. The actual HIC for the SID could not be calculated due to the signal loss related to disruption of the wiring system on both the X and Z accelerometers at 82 milliseconds from the beginning of the impact pulse. The data was analyzed on printed plots, electronic data would allow a more thorough and accurate analysis but was not available. With regard to the SID, the only two parameters currently used to evaluate occupant performance in a side impact 1331</page><page sequence="4">are TTI and lateral pelvis acceleration. TTI was not provided and cannot be calculated using hard copies of the data. The limit in FMVSS 214 for lateral pelvis acceleration is 130 G's. The peak value of 36.3 G's reported in this test was far less. Meeting this one criterion does not mean this occupant would have been protected in this crash, particularly in the light of the extreme nature of the kinematics observed on video. The high head acceleration values are of great concern. The SID crashed through the passive restraint on the forward end of the crew bench and impacted the front bulkhead cabinet. Signals from both the head X and Z accelerometers were lost early, i.e. prior to 100 milliseconds, in the test. The head Y accelerometer recorded both positive and negative peaks of over 100 G's between 172 and 183 milliseconds. This occurred when the SID's head contacted the rigid front bulkhead/cabinet. The magnitude of the acceleration prior to loss of data could not be evaluated from the hard copy data, but it appears it was less then 5 G's, thus indicating the SID had little force applied to accelerate the head prior to 70 milliseconds. This indicates a lack of coupling between the dummy and the vehicle, as expected with no seat belt used. Also noteworthy in the SID data is the lower spine Y acceleration that has very high oscillation that is explained by the contact with the passive restraint device. Acceleration went from a peak of +68G to -278G in just over 20 milliseconds. Neither the upper chest acceleration nor the pelvis accelerations show any similar results. The kinematics on the video demonstrated that the SID impacted the passive restraint device solely with the lateral aspects of the its pelvis and lower abdomen, resulting in the restraint device being crushed, fractured from its attachment on the forward end of the squad bench and completely destroyed. However this device did not prevent the SID from a high velocity head impact with the forward bulkhead. The electronic data in conjunction with these kinematics from the video, suggest that this occupant would likely have sustained a high severity injury to both the head and the lower spine and a major soft tissue injury to the liver and other abdominal structures. For the H-lll child ATD it is apparent that the child was well restrained during the crash. The head and chest resultant accelerations were 42 and 29 G's, respectively. The HIC was reported by TRC to be 171 which is well below the 1000 used as a threshold by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Specification 213 (FMVSS 213) to evaluate child restraints, and is also below even the most conservative proffered thresholds. The pelvic resultant acceleration peaked at 68.8 G's at approximately 105 milliseconds. This value appears high, given the acceleration on the head and chest. The motion of the lower limbs upon impact likely explain this finding. The major portion of this pelvic resultant acceleration comes from the Z component with a corresponding rise in the X component. While the Z component of the acceleration has a high spike, simultaneously the X component has a 15 G 25 milliseconds long pulse which is very noisy. It is possible that this acceleration is the result of an input to the stretcher from the ambulance box, but since all box acceleration data was lost prior to 105 milliseconds this cannot be confirmed. Child Restraint Performance: The child restraint system appeared to perform well in this test. It remained well secured to the stretcher throughout the impact. Post-test inspection of the CRS revealed that the shell had marks consistent with belt loading on the upper child harness slots and the rear- facing belt path slots. There was minor bunching of the child restraint harness at the latch plates. Neither of the belts used to restrain the CRS to the cot showed any significant signs of loading. All of these facts are consistent with the expected loading in this test. There were no signs that the CRS was nearing the limits of its ability to protect an occupant, nor was there any evidence of substantial occupant motion during the test. DISCUSSION This study is a preliminary step in a more comprehensive program to address the crashworthiness of ambulance vehicles in the United States. It does remain somewhat ironic that the very vehicle that is there to rescue occupants from an automotive crash, is in itself not a vehicle that meets any substantive crashworthiness or occupant safety standards. Clearly this study highlights the need for more research and development in this area. Specifically, refinement of the testing procedure to reflect more accurately real world crash conditions, and also modification of the data collection system so that data are not lost during events that occur during impact, should be performed. The limitations of this study included a number of issues which relate to the generalizability of the results: • There was data loss from the SID and the patient compartment, which limited the detail of the analysis that could be performed • The vehicle patient compartment used may not have been representative of the fleet of ambulance vehicles on the road. • There was no specific crash pulse or accelerator sled pin designed specifically for this impact environment • There is limited data on the crash configuration for ambulance vehicles to determine which is the most hazardous for injury • There was minimal medical equipment positioned in the rear cabin • The attachment system for the patient compartment to the chassis may not have representative of the fleet of ambulance vehicles on the road It may be that an augmentation of the occupant safety of these may include an energy absorbing structure to be included in the method of attaching the patient compartment box to the chassis. Full ambulance vehicle 1332</page><page sequence="5">crash testing should be conducted of ambulance vehicles which are representative of the current fleet. These tests should be performed under conditions which represent real world crash scenarios so as to ascertain a more accurate set of crash pulses for these vehicles. These pulses are necessary in order for validated sled testing to be conducted so as to advance the understanding of safety initiatives required for these unique vehicles. There is also a need to collect the information on crash types that are associated with injury and fatality, including occupant and equipment position and restraint systems in use, so that the appropriate testing schedules can be conducted reflecting real world practice. CONCLUSION The ambulance transport environment while hazardous includes predictable and preventable occupant risks. Failure to use the restraint systems fitted to vehicles creates risk for serious injury to both the occupant who is not restrained and can also create hazards for other restrained occupants. Current methods of passive occupant protection can fail catastrophically. The belting system used for securing the CRS to the gurney demonstrated effective restraint for the child occupant. The restraint practices for these high risk vehicles need to be reviewed and effective systems need to be designed and appropriately tested under impact conditions. There is a role for the reevaluating of the design of ambulance vehicles with a cross disciplinary team including EMS providers, automotive engineers, and public health researchers. Standards for ambulance vehicle occupant safety need to be developed.
