<plain_text><page sequence="1">Causation, Agency, and Independence Daniel M. Hausmant University of Wisconsin-Madison This paper explores versions of agency or manipulability theories of causation and argues that they are unacceptable both for the well-known reasons of their anthropo- morphism, limited scope, and circularity and because they are subsumed by an alter- native "independence" theory of causation, which is free of these difficulties. Causal knowledge matters to action. Causes are means. They are tools. People can use them to bring about their effects. This observation sug- gests a theory of causal asymmetry-something like: a causes b if and only if a can be used as a means to bring about b. This view has been especially attractive to scientists and statisticians since it ties the mean- ing of causation to the best methods of finding out what causes what. Price and Menzies call this theory of causation "the agency theory." 1. Agency Theories of Causation. The agency theory is not new. R. G. Collingwood maintains that causation is at root an anthropomorphic notion and that in practical contexts "A cause is an event or state of things which it is in our power to produce or prevent, and by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be" (1940, 296-297, Collingwood's emphasis). Indeed he maintains that someone who claimed to discover a cause of cancer that could not be produced or prevented at will would be ridiculed for misusing the word "cause." In theoretical contexts causation is implicitly conceived as compulsion exercised by something active over something else which, if not for the compulsion, would have behaved differently (1940, 324-326). Stripped of the anthropomorphism, only nomological rela- tions exist. Douglas Gasking, like Collingwood, holds that causation plays little tDepartment of Philosophy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706; e-mail: dhausman@macc.wisc.edu.

HAUSMAN part in theoretical science (1955, 487). In practical contexts, events of kind a cause events of kind b if there exists a "general manipulative technique" for bringing about a's which results sometimes (but not invariably) in an event of kind b occurring (1955, 483-484). Events we cannot bring about, such as the melting of the polar icecap, can be said to cause events such as the rise in the sea level in a particular epoch because they are of the same kind as events we can bring about. According to G. H. von Wright, the possibility of bringing about changes in q by manipulating p constitutes the asymmetry of causation. He writes, "What makes p a cause-factor relative to the effect factor q is, I shall maintain, the fact that by manipulating p, i.e., by producing changes in it 'at will' as we say, we could bring about changes in q" (1971, 118, von Wright's emphasis). Von Wright maintains that the non-manipulable factors in a functional relationship can only be ef- fects, never causes (1971, 119). More recently, Peter Menzies and Huw Price (1993) have argued that causation is a "secondary quality," an extrinsic property of rela- tions among events that is explained by its connections to human ex- perience. In the same way that an object is red just in case it would look red to a normal observer under standard conditions, so a causes b just in case an agent could use a's as an effective means to bring about b's (1993, 187). A is an "effective means" to bring about B if and only if the "agent probability" of B given A is greater than the agent probability of B given not-A. The agent probability of B given A is the probability that B obtains given that A is brought about "ab initio, as a free act of the agent concerned" (1993, 190). An agency theory can be formulated either as a counterfactual the- ory concerning causal relations between tokens (which I denote with lowercase a, b, c, etc.) or as a non-counterfactual theory concerning causal priority between types (denoted by a, b, c, etc.) or variables (denoted by x, y, z, etc.). This essay focuses on formulations in terms of variables. As argued in Ch. 7 of my forthcoming book, CausalAsym- metries, most of the conclusions drawn here apply equally to a coun- terfactual formulation. An agency theory thus says something like: "y depends on x in circumstances K if and only if in K one can affect the value of y by intervening to set the value of x." I take causal relations among types to be generalizations of causal relations among tokens. Claims about causal relations among variables are generalizations of such generalizations: y depends on x in circumstances K if and only if a whole set of such type causal relations obtains. 2. Formulating a Plausible Version of Agency Theory. As a first ap- proximation, agency theorists hold that the value of y depends on the S16</page><page sequence="3">CAUSATION, AGENCY, AND INDEPENDENCE value of x in circumstances K if and only if, given K, if human inter- ventions change the value of x, then the value of y changes but not vice versa. This formulation is inadequate. It might be the case that y depends on x, yet the value of y sometimes remains unchanged when interventions change the value of x, because there are compensating changes in the values of other variables or because for some values x* and x' of x, f(x*) = f(x'). It seems that instead one should formulate agency theory as something like: AT (Agency theory) y depends on x in circumstances K if and only if x and y are distinct and in K every intervention with respect to x affects y. This formulation makes explicit the distinctness of x and y and insists that there is a causal relationship between y and every intervention with respect to x. (It would be preferable to say that y is non-constant func- tion of x that remains invariant as the value of x is altered by inter- vention, but I do not have space in this essay to address issues con- cerning invariability.) Agency views face serious difficulties. First, the claims of agency the- orists are false or have an unreasonably limited scope. Fusion reactions in the sun provide light and heat on the earth. Yet there are no human interventions that can directly manipulate the fusion reactions within the sun. Gasking suggests that the reactions within the sun and the heating of the earth are of the same kinds as cause and effect pairs where ma- nipulation is possible and that we extend our causal judgments from cases where manipulation is possible to cases where it is not. Second, agency theories appear to be circular. They analyze the causal relationship between x and y in terms of the causal relation between y and interventions with respect to x, and the notion of an intervention itself apparently calls for some sort of causal analysis. I doubt that any noncircular analysis of causation is possible, and cir- cularities are not necessarily uninformative or unimportant, but one may have qualms about theories that are so narrowly circular. Third, the anthropomorphism of agency theories is disturbing. Does the asymmetry of causation depend only on human perspectives? Would there be no causal asymmetries if there were no agents? Could agents call anything they liked causes and effects? What is it "in the world" that our perspective as agents "grabs on to?" The most sophisticated attempt to counter these objections lies in recent work of Peter Menzies and Huw Price. In response to the ob- jection that agency theories are circular, Menzies and Price argue that agent-probabilities require no causal notions in their definition (other than the supposedly primitive notion of realizing some event via a hu- S17</page><page sequence="4">DANIEL M. HAUSMAN man intervention), and causal relations are then defined in terms of agent probabilities (1993, 194). One may question whether the notion of an intervention is a primitive and whether agent probabilities avoid relying on causal notions. Menzies and Price's response to the other criticisms of agency the- ories is of special interest. They argue that the objection that causal relations may obtain among things that are not subject to human ma- nipulation is analogous to criticisms of theories of secondary qualities. Surely objects may be red even if there are no observers to whom they look red. The answer to the apparent difficulty, they maintain, is the same in both cases. Objects that are red but never appear red may have the same physical properties as objects that appear red. They possess the objective "basis" for the disposition to appear red to human ob- servers in normal lighting. Menzies and Price write, [W]hen an agent can bring about one event as a means to bring about another, this is true in virtue of certain basic features of the situation involved, these features being essentially non-causal though not necessarily physical in character ....In its weakened form, the agency account states that a pair of events are causally related just in case the situation involving them possesses intrinsic features that either support a means-end relation between the events as is, or are identical with (or closely similar to) those of another situation involving an analogous pair of means-end related events. (1993, 197) The asymmetry of manipulability is true "in virtue of certain basic features of the situation involved." Causation extends beyond circum- stances in which agency is possible because the asymmetry of causation depends on "objective features" that may obtain when human inter- ventions are not possible. Causation is not entirely anthropomorphic. Causal claims, like claims concerning colors, make reference to human beings, but there are nevertheless extra-human factors in virtue of which things have colors or events stand in causal relations. According to this defense, b may causally depend on a even when realizing a's is not an effective way, nor any way at all, of bringing about b's. Is this revised account still an agency theory? The role of agency seems to be restricted to identifying the intrinsic conditions in virtue of which causal relations obtain. Whether causal relations obtain depends on whether those conditions are met. Agency matters only in the acquisition of causal notions and the discovery of causal relations. This conclusion would be just, if the intrinsic features in virtue of which a's affect b's were uniform. Someone who combined an agency view such as Menzies and Price's with a Humean theory of the intrinsic S18</page><page sequence="5">CAUSATION, AGENCY, AND INDEPENDENCE conditions in virtue of which causes can be used as means to bring about their effects would be committed to a Humean theory of cau- sation, not to an agency theory. But suppose that the existence of causal relations depended on different features in different cases, and the only common element in the cases was the possibility of intervention. (In just the same way reference to the disposition to appear red may not be dispensable in the theory of colors if there is no uniform physical property of surfaces in virtue of which they appear red.) Whether agency is a steppingstone toward discovering the nature of causation or whether it is a constituent of the notion of causation itself depends on whether there is any intelligible, systematic, and reasonably unified characterization of the intrinsic features in virtue of which causal relations obtain. Agency theory seems to be a default position. If all other theories of causal priority fail, one is left with agency theory. Thus Price argues that an objective asymmetry of causation, such as the fork asymmetry, "is not a sufficiently basic and widespread feature of the structure of the world to constitute the difference between cause and effect" (1992, 502). In particular, he argues that this asymmetry breaks down in the microscopic realm, while the asymmetry of agency (referring as it does to the doings of macroscopic beings) does not (1992, 516; see also Price 1996, Ch. 7). 3. Agency and Independence. This defense fails. It turns out, I shall argue, that agency theories break down whenever a so-called "inde- pendence theory of causal asymmetry" breaks down. So agency theory is not a default. To make this case, one needs to spell out the notion of an "inter- vention" or a "manipulation." The basic idea is that there is a human intervention that affects only the value of x if and only if there is some kind of human action a (or some intervention variable z) that directly affects the value of x and has no causal links to any of the other vari- ables apart from directly influencing the value of x. In particular, a's must not be effects of any of the other variables or of any of their causes, and their only direct causal influence must be on x. This account will not consider interventions that change the causal structure or the value of coefficients. It is concerned only with interventions that set the values of variables. One sorts experimental subjects randomly into experimental and control groups to insure that what one takes to be an intervention is truly an intervention. If one's sorting of rats, for example, were affected by something correlated with their propensity to develop bladder can- cer, one's administration of saccharin would depend on this preexisting propensity. One would not be truly intervening in feeding the rats sac- S19</page><page sequence="6">DANIEL M. HAUSMAN charine, and one would be unjustified in concluding that saccharin af- fects the incidence of bladder cancer in rats. What caused one to ad- minister the saccharine, not the saccharine itself, might be the culprit. In order to draw conclusions concerning results of interventions, one must assume that there are kinds of actions that can affect the values of each variable separately. One might say that one must assume that interventions are "possible." This terminology may be puzzling, since there is nothing explicitly modal in the type-level formulations. Yet I would argue that it is possible to intervene if and only if at the type level there are kinds of actions satisfying the definition of an interven- tion. If there were not in fact an "opening" for an intervention-which is all that an intervention variable abstractly is-then no interventions would be possible. Human interventions are of course not always possible. When they are not possible, then inferences based on a simple version of agency theory such as AT will break down. One might think of a more abstract notion of an intervention, which need not be a human action, and which might always be possible-though such a notion would not be welcomed by agency theorists, who rely on an explicitly anthropomor- phic notion of an intervention. Given the transitivity of causation and a trivial technical condition, one can deduce the particular formulation of agency theory-AT- from the definition of an intervention and the assumption that inter- ventions are possible. (See Theorem 1 in the Appendix.) This shows that in the circumstances in which interventions are possible, there is nothing in agency theory to which defenders of other views of causal asymmetry should object. Agency theory is only a restatement of the definition of an intervention coupled with the assertion that interven- tions are always possible. There is no reason to regard AT as a com- peting theory of causal asymmetry. Consider further what is implicit in the assumption that interven- tions are possible. Suppose that x causes y and z and that a value- setting intervention is possible with respect to y. Then there must exist a variable w that satisfies the following conditions: (1) w causes y, (2) w does not cause x or z, (3) w is not caused by x, y, or z, and (4) w is not caused by any cause of x, y, or z. These implications of the assumption that an intervention is possible with respect to y can be expressed more compactly with the help of the notion of a (symmetrical) relation of "causal or necessary connection." One might take this as an intuitive notion in need of clarification and analysis with which one can make the following metaphysical claim: CC (The Connection Principle): x and y are causally connected if S20</page><page sequence="7">CAUSATION, AGENCY, AND INDEPENDENCE and only if they are distinct and either x causes y, y causes x, or x and y are effects of a common cause. CC maintains that one finds non-accidental "connections" between distinct variables if and only if they are related as cause and effect or as effects of a common cause. Those who find this claim dubious and the notion of a causal connection suspect can take CC as defining the notion of a causal connection. This is how Reichenbach regarded CC (1956, 29). Given the notion of a causal connection, the assumption that a vari- able-setting intervention w is possible with respect to y implies that w is causally connected to y and is not causally connected to any variable that is not an effect of y. The assumption that interventions are always possible, or that the intrinsic relations are similar to those in which interventions are possible thus implies the following independence con- dition (see Theorem 2): I' (The Strong Independence Condition): For all x, there exists in circumstances K some variable z, causally connected to x, and in- dependent of any variable that is not an effect of x. This strong independence condition in turn implies the following weaker condition: I (The Independence Condition): If in circumstances K, y does not cause x, and x causes y, or x and y are effects of a common cause, then y has a cause that is independent of x. The independence condition, I, says that events that are caused have multiple causes, not all of which are causally connected to one another, and that effects of a common cause each have their own independent causes. There is a great deal to be said about the independence con- dition, but all I shall say here is that it is much weaker than the as- sumption that interventions are possible. Given transitivity, one can derive the following from the connection principle and the independence condition (see Theorem 3 in the Ap- pendix): CP (The Independence Theory of Causal Priority): x causes y in circumstances K if and only if in K x and y are causally connected, and everything causally connected to x and distinct from y is caus- ally connected to y. CP, the independence theory, says that the difference between causes and effects is that effects are causally connected to one another, while causes are independent of one another (in the specified way). Since the S21</page><page sequence="8">DANIEL M. HAUSMAN independence condition follows from the assumption that interventions are possible, CP can be deduced from transitivity, the connection prin- ciple, and the assumption that interventions are possible or from tran- sitivity, CC, and AT (Theorem 4). CP is, I contend, superior to agency theory. If the independence theory is false, then either the connection principle, transitivity, or agency theory itself must be false. There are reasons to question tran- sitivity at the type level, but they cannot be deployed here in defense of agency theory, because similar results obtain at the token level, and because the particular reliance on transitivity can be defended. Since it is difficult to reject the connection principle, it is hard to accept agency theory without also accepting the independence theory. The problems of an objective theory such as CP thus do not constitute an argument for agency theory. Agency theory faces all the same problems as well as any further difficulties posed by cases in which interventions are not possible. When interventions are possible, AT adds nothing to CP, and if CP were not generally correct, in the domain in which human action and intervention is possible, then it would not be true that people could use causes to manipulate their effects and not vice versa. CP inherits the plausibility of agency theories, while overcoming their limited scope and their anthropomorphism. Since the independence theory mentions only causal connections among variables, which are indicated by cor- relations or probabilistic dependencies, it opens the circle of agency theory and avoids taking the notion of a free action as a primitive. CP is more general than AT and fills in the "intrinsic features" that obtain when there are causal relations among things, whether or not they are subject to human manipulation. It might seem that the close relation between interventions and strong independence is a two-edged sword. Does it not show that CP, the independence theory of causal priority, will break down when agency theory fails? No. Even though strong independence will typi- cally fail whenever interventions are not possible, strong independence is closely tied to the existence of abstract interventions, not to the ex- istence of specifically human interventions. The possibility of human interventions implies strong independence, but not vice versa. Fur- thermore, CP depends only on the weaker independence condition I, not on the strong independence condition. This argument for the independence theory of causal asymmetry can be strengthened in one further way. One criticism of theories of causal asymmetry is that even if they enable one to distinguish causes and effects correctly, they fail to capture what is at the heart of the distinc- tion. Even if, as Hume maintained, causes do always precede their effects, this difference in time does not seem to be of the right "char- S22</page><page sequence="9">CAUSATION, AGENCY, AND INDEPENDENCE acter" (see Honderich 1982, 314). Similarly one might object that even if the effects of an event are causally connected to one another, while not all of its causes are, this difference cannot lie at the heart of the difference between causes and effects. Agency theory, in contrast, seems to strike close to the heart of the distinction between causes and effects. The fact that causes can be used to manipulate their effects, but not vice versa seems to be linked to the idea that causes are "effective" and that they "necessitate" their effects. I would suggest (vaguely echoing Collingwood) that the thought that causes necessitate their effects is a metaphysical exaggeration of the fact that agents make effects happen by means of their causes. If this suggestion is correct, then the entailment of CP by AT shows that the independence of causes and connectedness of effects is, so to speak, the objective "substance" of the effectiveness of causes or the necessitation of effects. In other words, the asymmetry of independence is the in- trinsic difference between causes and effects that manifests itself to agents like us as the effectiveness of causes and the necessitation of effects. Independence is implicit in intervention and invariance. It is the independence of those events we call "causes" and the connected- ness of those we call "effects" that constitutes specifically causal rela- tions. The conditional entailment of CP by AT coupled with the hy- pothesis that necessitation is at root an anthropomorphic notion constitutes a strong reason to believe that CP captures the central fea- tures of the priority of causes to their effects. 4. Conclusion. Those who are committed to agency theory are also (whether they like it or not) committed to CP. Given this commitment, there is no good reason to develop agency theory as an alternative account of causal asymmetry, and many good reasons not to do so. CP captures the asymmetry upon which the facts of manipulability depend in a more general way. The fact that agency theory has few virtues as an alternative account of causal asymmetry does not show that it without virtues. On the contrary, in exploring the relations between causation and agency, one learns much about the nature of causation. The relations between agency and causation are of the utmost importance in testing causal claims and in understanding the acquisition of causal notions and their grip on our thinking. The links between intervention and independence also enable one to see why independence lies at the heart of causation. S23</page><page sequence="10">DANIEL M. HAUSMAN APPENDIX Proofs I shall employ the four following propositions to state and prove Theo- rem 1: DHI (Definition of a Human Intervention) In circumstances K, z is a human intervention variable with respect to x only (given a set of variables V) if and only if in K (1) z is distinct from all variables in V, (2) z directly affects x, (3) all other connections between z and members of Vfollow from z being a direct influence on x, and (4) values of z are kinds of human actions. PI (Possibility of Intervention) Given the set V of variables and the circum- stances K of concern, there is, for each variable x in V, some z that is an intervention variable with respect to x only. T (Transitivity) If in circumstances K z depends on y and y depends on x and z and x are distinct, then z depends on x. PP (Path Principle) Suppose in circumstances K that z directly affects x and does not directly affect anything else, then y depends on z if and only if y depends on x. Theorem 1: DHI, PI, T, and PP imply AT. Proof: Suppose that y depends on x in circumstances K. By PI there will be some intervention with respect to x. By DHI that intervention affects x and is distinct from y. By T that intervention will thus influence y. To prove the converse, suppose that all interventions that directly af- fect x affect y. By DHI, values of the intervention variable cannot directly influence the value of y. So by PP y must depend on x. Theorem 2: Given CC, I' is entailed by DI and PI. Proof: Given DI and PI, for every y, there is some intervention variable z. Given CC z is not causally connected to anything connected to y that is not an effect of y. The converse does not follow, because I' does not imply that x has a cause that is not a direct cause of any other variable. Even though DI and PI are thus not entailed by I' (given CC and asymmetry), one will seldom satisfy strong independence without satisfying PI. Indeed it is arguable that interventions should be defined so as to make the assumption that abstract interventions are possible (that is, interven- tions that are not necessarily human actions are possible) equivalent to strong independence. Theorem 3: I, CC, and T entail CP. Proof: Suppose first that x causes y and that z is causally connected to x. Then z is either (i) a cause of x, (ii) an effect of x, or (iii) an effect of some cause w of x. In case (i) transitivity implies that z is a cause of y. In case (ii), if z is distinct from y, then y and z are effects of a common cause (x). In case (iii) given transitivity y and z are effects of a common cause (w). So in all three cases z is causally connected to y. To prove the converse, suppose that x does not cause y and that x S24</page><page sequence="11">CAUSATION, AGENCY, AND INDEPENDENCE and y are causally connected. Then either y causes x or x and y are effects of a common cause. In either case, given I, there exists some variable z causally connected to x and not to y. So it is not the case that everything causally connected to x is causally connected to y. Theorem 4: DHI, CC, T, and AT entail CP. Proof: Suppose that in Kx andy are causally connected and everything distinct from y and causally connected to x is connected to y. If there is in K an intervention z with respect to x only, then (by DHI and CC) it is distinct from y and connected to x. So it is causally connected to y. Since (again by DHI) z cannot be an effect of any of the variables, CC implies that z affects y, and by AT it follows that y depends on x. As shown in the first part of the previous proof, the converse follows from T and CC. REFERENCES Collingwood, R. G. (1940), An Essay on Metaphysics. Oxford: Clarendon Press.
