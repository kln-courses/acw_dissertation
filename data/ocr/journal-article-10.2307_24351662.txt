VERHAREN In and Out of Africa Misreading Afrocentrism RESUME Le livre de Mary Lefkowitz, Not Out of Africa, a récemment attiré l'attention du public américain et international sur le débat de l'afrocentrisme. Bien que la position de Lefkowitz se démarque nettement de celle de Cheikh Anta Diop qui posait comme hypothèse que toutes les cultures présentent une conti nuité que l'on peut faire remonter à leur origine africaine, une lecture attentive de Not Out of Africa montre clairement que son auteur admet, en dépit de sa critique de l'afrocentrisme, certaines de ses thèses. Après avoir défini l'afrocentrisme, l'article examine les dif férences d'approche de Diop et de Lefkowitz et met en lumière des divergences méthodologiques. To learn about Africa we must look where the Afro centrists fail to look, that is, to the historical Egypt des cribed by the ancient Egyptians themselves... Mary Lefkowitz, Not Out of Africa (p. 135)' ... the return to Egypt in all domains is the necessary condition for reconciling African civilizations with his tory, in order... to renovate African culture.

Look. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (p. 66) Mary Lefkowitz' subtitle to Not Out of Africa claims that Afrocentrism is « an excuse to teach myth as history ». The myth is the idea of European civilization's origin in Egypt. With this thesis, Lefkowitz appears to espouse a Eurocentric metho dology whose principles have been fixed over the past several centuries. She looks at African experience through European eyes and cannot see a major African influence on Greek culture. But a close reading of the text shows how Lefkowitz' criti cisms of Afrocentrism commit her to several hypotheses that are remarkable for their Afrocentric character : the Greeks themselves were the world's earliest Afrocentrists (p. 53-85) ; the Egyptians can accurately be called people of color (p. 13) ; the Egyptians influenced Greek culture over a long period of time (p. 161) ; and Egyptian and other African cultures exhibit remarkable similarities (p. 135). With these four theses, Lefkowitz displays a nascent Afro centric philosophy. Lefkowitz' « accidental » Afrocentrism is the ironic complement of her most forceful critique of Afrocen trism. She claims that Afrocentrism sees Egypt through a Euro pean lens, cut off from its African roots. Afrocentrism's fatal flaw is thus its Eurocentricity. Reflection on her own metho dology will show that her own Eurocentricity is well on its way to becoming Afrocentric. This essay's first part examines alternative definitions of Afrocentrism. The second part explores Lefkowitz' dismissal of Cheikh Anta Diop's Afrocentric claims. The third part consi ders Egyptian ontology's sophistication. The fourth part addresses Afrocentrism's research methodology. The essay's conclusion discusses the consequences of Lefko witz' position for African American life. Lefkowitz worries about Afrocentrism's consequences for Greek sensibilities (p. 168). But she must consider how her own work follows the European tradition of denying African contributions to world culture. With Hegel, Lefkowitz rallies around the call : Not out of Africa. Her research philosophy undermines African Ame rican self-images and thwarts research into possibilities of cultural continuity stretching from an African past to the global present.</page><page sequence="3">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 165 DEFINING AFROCENTRISM Lefkowitz' misreading of Afrocentrism starts with her defi nition, taken in part from G.M. James, a founder of Afrocen trism in her eyes. She argues that James' Stolen Legacy constructs an Egypt that is Greco-Roman rather than African (p. 135, 136). Like other Afrocentrists, he focuses on Egypt to the exclusion of « other African civilizations, such as that of Nubia... » (p. 156). In recapitulating an Egypt of European invention, Afrocentrism « prevents students from learning about real ancient African civilizations » (p. 156, emphasis mine). Lefkowitz' own research methodology dictates that since Egypt is in Africa, we must look to Africa herself for a true definition of Egypt : « To learn about Africa we must look where the Afrocentrists fail to look, that is, to the historical Egypt described by the ancient Egyptians themselves, and to the important cultural links to neighboring parts of Africa » (p. 135). If Lefkowitz paid careful attention to Cheikh Anta Diop, the Afrocentrist who devoted his career to careful examination of the « historical Egypt », she would have found that he had anti cipated her advice. For Diop, close study of Egypt, grounded in « a body of modern human sciences », is the primary step in reconstituting African cultures distorted by colonialism : « In reconceived and renewed African culture, Egypt will play the same role that Greco-Roman antiquity plays in Western culture » (p. 3). Given Diop's definition of Afrocentrism, Lefkowitz' primary research principle is profoundly Afrocentric. Afrocentrism starts with an examination of the African past. Lefkowitz makes a bold departure from Hegel's Eurocentrism by claiming that Egypt can only be understood in the context of the wider Afri can cultures that share distinctive features with Egypt. Hegel proclaimed that Egypt is in no way African, and he finds the proximity of sophisticated Egyptian and barbaric African cultures to be astonishing. Noting that Herodotus' informants judged the Egyptians to be « the wisest of man kind », Hegel is amazed to find the glorious Egyptian civiliza tion « in the vicinity of African stupidity » (p. 204). More than a century of post-Hegelian scholarship allows Lef</page><page sequence="4">166 PRESENCE AFRICAINE kowitz to dismiss Hegel's position. Lefkowitz relies on classical sources for her rejection of Hegel, as well as anthropological evidence that Hegel could not imagine would be worth seeking. She notes that East African kings share the Egyptian pharaoh's partial divinity. She claims that the « elaborate rhythmic hand clapping » observed by Herodotus at Egyptian festivals must be a wider African phenomenon (p. 135, 136). In criticizing James for making Egypt Greco-Roman, Lef kowitz ignores the fact that information about African and Egyptian cultural commonalities was very likely not available to James, since the anthropological search for them has begun only recently2. As Lefkowitz' criticism of James makes clear, some Afro centric scholarship departs from professional standards. While Lefkowitz is familiar with the scholarship that has led to contemporary definitions of Afrocentrism (p. 127-134), St. Clair Drake's Black Folk Here and There shows that Afrocen trism is an idea (if not a name) that dates back to the early 1800's in African-American communities. Much of the support for Afrocentric research comes from non-academic black com munities. Even though James was himself a professor (Lefko witz, 10), for example, his research does not follow the acade mic community's conventions, as is clear from the absence of critical apparatus in his work. A scholarly attack on a non-scholarly work is a mismatched contest. Lefkowitz would be far more just in her criticism of Afrocentrism if she relied on Diop's scholarship for her defi nition Molefi Asante, described by Lefkowitz as a leading pro ponent of Afrocentrism, singles out Diop as his primary Afro centric influence (Asante, V). But Lefkowitz pays only cursory 2. James' Stolen Legacy was published in 1954 (although Lefkowitz appears not to cite his publisher in her critical apparatus). James may have had access to Henri Frankfort's Kingship and the Gods (Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 1948) for analogues between Egyptian and East African kingship. See Lefkowitz (p. 135, 208). However, scholarly anthropological research into autonomous cultural exchanges between Egypt and Nubia began only with Bonnet's (1990) and O'Connor's (1993) work in the past quarter century. Prior to their research programs, archaeologists assumed that Nubia was a dependent Egyptian colony, at least until Nubia's conquest of Egypt. 3.

DIOP'S AFROCENTRISM As Diop indicates in the introduction to Civilization or Bar barism, his final and most powerful work, Afrocentrism is grounded in the idea that all cultures have a continuity that can be traced back to an African origin (p. 1-7). Afrocentrism's importance on the contemporary scene derives from issues of humanity's survival. In the past, cultures have distanced themselves from one another by tactics of dehumanization, even demonization. Diop claims that given the destructive powers of contemporary civi lization, we can only survive by renouncing the barbarism of cultural divisiveness for the sake of a new global concept of civilization. On the eve of the postindustrial era, an exaggera ted sense of cultural identity precipitates culture wars. Far from being matters of mere preference or aesthetic interest, culture wars vie with race wars as engines of genocide. Israelis and Palestinians, Serbs and Bosnians, Hutus and Tutsis find their counterparts around the world. While hardly new, culture wars now threaten life in unpre cedented ways. Cultural mobility and technological power push culture wars to life-threatening global proportions. Against this cultural Armageddon, Diop suggests that an « African optimism inclines us to wish that all nations would join hands in order to build a planetary civilization instead of sinking down to bar barism » (p. 7). Diop believes that all nations must contribute to this plane tary civilization, and the common ground for all their efforts must be scientific methodology. Diop's « return to Egypt... to renovate African culture » aims « to construct a body of modern human sciences... » (p. 3). So attached to a common methodo logy is Diop that his preliminary conviction about the primacy of African cultures derives from European scholarship. Lefkowitz fails to consider carefully Diop's evidence for his</page><page sequence="6">168 PRESENCE AFRICAINE Afrocentric thesis4. Taking his lead from the French scholar Emile Amelinéau, Diop argues that the Timaeus, one of the most important texts in Greek philosophy, cannot be unders tood without examining the Egyptian philosophical concepts on which it is based (p. 337-353). Lefkowitz addresses Diop's claims about the Timaeus but she dismisses any possibility of deep structural dependence. Her fundamental research hypothesis is that superficial simi larities in texts must be based on coincidence rather than cultu ral lineage. Lefkowitz argues that the similarities between Greek and Egyptian cosmologies are not products of cultural diffusion, but accidents of spontaneous, independent origina tion. Criticizing Diop's idea that Heraclitus received his theory of opposites from Egyptian priests, for example, she claims that « the notion of opposites can be found in virtually any religious text, because it is a fundamental mode of human thought » (p. 152-153). The philosophical issue here is the set of assumptions driving research in the two cultures. Lefkowitz' paradigm precludes a search for patterns of cultural diffusion because of her assump tion of independent origination for analogous cultural features. She would support her primary hypothesis with cross-cultural comparisons that show the multiphcity of cultural analogues. Diop's paradigm is one of cultural diffusion. He would point to the same evidence to support his hypothesis. His research assumption drives him to look for identity, while Lefkowitz searches for difference. These paradigms reflect radically dif ferent temperaments. Fortunately, the difference abets rather than thwarts good scholarship. Lefkowitz argues that Diop's belief that Plato spent thirteen years studying Egyptian philosophy in Heliopolis is based on a mistaken Greek assumption that high Greek culture is groun ded in Egypt. Lefkowitz claims that Diop's only textual evi dence for Plato's use of Egyptian ideas is that « in the Timaeus Plato says the world was created by a demiurge, and that Ra, the god of Heliopohs, was also said to have created the world » (p. 151,152). She accuses Diop of naively assuming, like James, 4. Not Out of Africa's reflects index Lefkowitz' cursory attention to Diop. In one citation, there is no reference to Diop on the page cited (p. 166). Her most substantive treatment of Diop's work (p. 151-153) is missing altogether in the index. Her most trenchant criticism of Diop derives from a secondary source (p. 153, note 98).</page><page sequence="7">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 169 that « the existence of common themes is a proof of depen dency » (p. 152). Lefkowitz does not mention the fact that Diop's argument for Plato's dependence on Heliopolitan philosophy is based on European scholarship. Taking his lead from Amelinéau's work, Diop claims much more than a vague similarity between Ra and Plato's demiurge. He cites four points of comparison. First, neither Ra nor Plato's demiurge « create » the world in the sense of bringing it into a state of existence from a state of non-existence. Second, in both cosmogonies the « world » as formless mat ter in a chaotic state served as a primordial matter to be res tructured by an « ordering » rather than a « creating » god. Third, the « blueprint » for bringing unformed matter into the structured universe exists in an independent way for both Plato and the Egyptians. The divine essences, the « forms » of Plato, are the templates that the demiurge consults in ordering the universe, just as Ma'at is the divine order of a universe brought to perfection by Ra's ministrations. Fourth, the fundamental ontologies of Plato and the Egyp tians are identical : a primordial matter, a set of ordering prin ciples, and a divine intelligence that brings chaotic matter to a more perfect form (p. 339-342). If Diop could only cite one resemblance between the Greek and Egyptian cosmogonies, then Lefkowitz' criticism would be quite telling. It is plausible that a single idea might evolve inde pendently in two separate cultures. Lefkowitz criticism of Diop's claim that Heraclitus' « law of opposites » must be Egyp tian in origin is forceful (p. 153). However, Diop's work on the Timaeus cites four points of striking similarity, though Lefkowitz mentions only one of them. Diop also makes broad claim for other points of resem blance : archetypes (forms or essences) ; immortal individual and world-souls ; earth, air, fire, and water as the four ele ments. Also included are the « mathematical essence of the world conceived as a pure number, metempsychosis, the soul of the stars, sphere of the fixed stars, celestial equator, ecliptic, theory of the movement of the planets... » (p. 340). Diop does not pursue these possible points of resemblance in any detail. But he assumes that other scholars have explored this ground thoroughly enough to lend weight to his claims. In particular, Diop cites Amelinéau's remark that Plato did not</page><page sequence="8">170 PRESENCE AFRICAINE simply copy Egyptian texts but « interpreted » them « with incomparable brilliance » (p. 341). Amelinéau's work has had no lasting effect on current scho larship in classical philosophy, but that is not evidence that his hypothesis of Egyptian influence on Greek thought is wrong. Lefkowitz' summary dismissal of the hypothesis is grounded in her own conviction rather than scholarship. In her view, any resemblance between Greek and Egyptian cosmogonies must be coincidental : « The important Egyptian religious texts share only a few general common themes with the Greek philosophical writings, most of which can be found in the religious works of other ancient Mediterranean peoples » (p. 157). But can it be only coincidence that both cosmogonies share four primary fea tures (no creation ex nihilo, raw material, structure, and archi tect) ? Perhaps, but without further investigation, a hypothesis of cultural diffusion seems quite as robust as one of indepen dent origination. EGYPTIAN ONTOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION Lefkowitz also discusses a point of comparison between Egyptian and Aristotelian ontologies. Against James' claim that Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover was « stolen » from Memphite theology, Lefkowitz argues that Aristotle's « abstract theology » can have nothing in common with « the anthropo morphic creator god Ptah of the Memphite Theology. All that the two texts have in common is a concern with creation of the universe » (p. 141). With this statement, Lefkowitz joins thinkers throughout the ages who have belittled Egyptian anthropomorphic represen tations of the gods without exploring their allegorical possibi lities. Here Lefkowitz may be guilty of venturing out of her own field of expertise. Erik Hornung in Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt cites an ancient dialogue between Momos and Zeus to remind us of the folly of underestimating Egyptian phi losophical sophistication : Momos : But you, you dog-faced Egyptian, dressed-up</page><page sequence="9">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 171 in linen, who do you think you are, my friend ? How do you expect to pass for a god, when you howl as you do ?... Zeus : These things you observe about the Egyptians are truly shocking. All the same, Momus, the greater part of them has a mystic significance, and it's not all right to laugh at them, just because you are not one of the initia ted (Lucian, 2nd cent. AD, Deorum concilium quoted in Hornung, p. 15). Hornung claims that Egyptian ontology is so sophisticated that we require concepts from contemporary physics and logic to comprehend its logical structure (p. 237-243). For Hornung, Egyptian cosmology explains not only the origin of the gods and the universe, but also the emergence of being from non-being (p. 143-169, 172-186). If Hornung is correct about Egyptian sophistication, Lefko witz oversteps the bounds of her research field. She admits that classicists may be tempted to exaggerate Greek accomplish ments. But the temptation, as she notes, is common to all spe cialists in antiquity : « Egyptologists may be inclined to make the same mistake in the opposite direction. We recognize that no historian can write without some amount of bias ; that is why history must always be rewritten » (p. 161). But Lefkowitz' principles for rewriting history deserve careful scrutiny. AFROCENTRIC METHODOLOGY In her concluding remarks Lefkowitz asks whether Afrocen trism is a new historical methodology (p. 158). She believes that Afrocentrism's primary problem comes from relying on cultu ral relativism. Her definition of cultural relativism makes it an epistemology whereby cultural interests assume far more weight in research than does historical evidence. She claims that Afro centrists like Asante and Diop construct histories that pay no attention to available evidence : « Asante appears to be saying that no one need believe anything that any European says about Africa » (p. 159). Neither Diop nor Asante subscribe to such a research metho dology. As I indicated above, much of Diop's interpretation of</page><page sequence="10">172 PRESENCE AFRICAINE Egyptian texts is in fact based on European scholarship. For Diop, there can be only one research methodology, namely that of science. Science is a system of generalizations that must be tested through experience. No claim can stand without evi dence, and the evidence must be consensual across cultures. Diop's keen interest in the implications of quantum mechanics (especially multi-valued logics and the Bell Theorem) shows the extent of his philosophical reflection on scientific method (p. 368-375). Diop's treatment of historical evidence is couched in the phi losophy of science of his day5. This literature called the very nature of a fact into question by claiming that all facts are theory laden. Evidence cannot stand alone but must be inter preted in the context of a theory. Theories in their turn do not rise and fall on the basis of evidence alone. Evidence must be interpreted in light of the background assumptions supporting the theory6. The dispute between geocentrists and heliocentrists a clas sical example of the complex relations among theory, evidence, and background assumptions. The parties to the dispute diffe red primarily in their background assumptions. Both parties agreed that evidence of parallax (the apparent motion of the fixed stars due to the real motion of the earth) would support heliocentrism, but no parallax could be detected. The heliocen trists had to assume that parallax could not be detected because the nearest stars were astronomical distances from the obser ver's position. The instruments of the time were too coarse to detect parallax over such extreme distances. The geocentrists did not imagine that the galaxy could be as vast as we now know 5. Diop was born in 1923 and died in 1986. He received his doctorate in history at the Sorbonne in 1960 (see Samb, Cheikh Anta Diop). For a review essay on his work, see Mamadou Diouf and Mohamad Mbodj, « The Shadow of Cheikh Anta Diop ». 6. Diop's remarks on the philosophy of science in Civilization and Bar barism (p. 361-375) indicate his familiarity with models of science developed in Wittgenstein's Tractatus, Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and Quine's Theories and Things. Diop explicitly mentions the work of Max Jam mer, Niels Bohr, Max Born, Einstein, Boris Podolsky, Nathan Rosen, David Böhm, John von Neumann, J.S. Bell, Olivier Costa de Beauregard, and Alain Aspect. Diop claims that philosophical reflection on science will transform philosophy : « Philosophy's present misery corresponds to the time interval that separate the death of the classical philosopher and the birth of the new philosopher... (p. 375).</page><page sequence="11">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 173 it to be. Their failure was primarily one of philosophical ima gination. Both parties paid equal attention to the evidence, but phi losophical assumptions dictated the proper interpretation of the evidence. Neither side had any means for measuring the distance from the solar system to the fixed stars, so neither party had any « factual » evidence for its presuppositions. The final resolution of the dispute depended on instruments capable of detecting stellar parallax. These did not become available until F. Bessel's work in 18387. Theories, whether historical or scientific, are systems for representing experience. In Wittgenstein's metaphor, theories are like maps (1961). They can represent their terrain or their « evidence » by quite different means of projection. No map, however, can disregard the terrain, just as no hypothesis can disregard evidence. In claiming that Afrocentrists dispense with evidence for the sake of a higher cultural « truth », Lefkowitz pays no attention to Diop's lifelong efforts to find evidence corroborating his hypotheses about the African origins of civilization. Her cries of « cultural relativism » should not obscure the true nature of her conflict with Diop. The argument is not so much about evi dence, as about the philosophical motive to look for evidence. European classical scholars and Afrocentrists cite the same texts in support of their hypotheses. But contemporary classi cists insist that the Greeks were simply mistaken in claiming Egyptian origins for their culture, since no non-textual evi dence supports the Greek's Afrocentric hypothesis8. 7. For a detailed treatment of the parallax example, see my Rationality in Philosophy and Science, p. 112-117. 8. Lefkowitz' colleague and reviewer, Glen Bowersock, summarizes this refutation : « The standard scholarly position on Egypt and the Greeks goes as follow : The Greeks had great respect for Egyptian culture, which was older than theirs, and they observed parallels in their religion and thought to what they found in Egypt. So they supposed that they had borrowed from the Egyptians. However, in the 20th century we can show with the analytical tools of scholarship (above all, source criticism and documentary material such as inscriptions, coins and papyri) that they were wrong. I subscribe to this position, but we have to admit that it cannot be promulgated as proven fact » (p. 7). Bowersock's language is instructive. The Greeks suffered under an Afrocentric illusion that « they had borrowed from the Egyptians ». But contemporary scholarly tools have produced no evidence of specific cultural transfer. However, as Bowersock admits, absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence. The « not out of Africa » hypothesis « cannot be promulgated as</page><page sequence="12">174 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE Have recent tools of scholarship developed new evidence ? No scholars conversant in both Egyptology and classical philo sophy have conducted research to link Hornung's claims for extraordinary sophistication in Egyptian cosmology to Diop's arguments about our inability to understand the Timaeus without a background knowledge of Egyptian cosmology. Lefkowitz would be impatient with calls for further research on the question because of her philosophical conviction that no evidence will be found to support Afrocentrism. She considers the question closed. She cannot admit that Afrocentrists might have a legitimate philosophical difference with her point of view. For her, the primary reason for Afrocentrism's rise in the academies is a pernicious cultural relativism. Like Dinesh D'Souza in the End of Racism, Lefkowitz lays the blame for much of what is wrong with academia to cultural relativism : « Instructors in universities... are suspicious of the value of facts, or to put it another way, they think that facts are meaningless because they can be manipulated and reinter preted » (p. 48). For Lefkowitz, cultural relativism implies that there can be many diverse « truths » (p. 162). Lefkowitz agrees with the contemporary commonplace that all facts are theory laden. Nearly every history includes « bias of some sort » and no historical account can be « entirely accu rate ». However, historians have always known that they write « with an evident bias » (p. 48). Lefkowitz thinks that cultural relativism puts a new spin on this old healthy skepticism about historical facts. If societal values engender « unconscious » bias, then history must be regarded as a « cultural projection » of social values « whether individual writers are aware of it or not » (p. 48, 49). Cultural relativism « make[s] it possible to say that all history is by definition fiction » (p. 49). Diop would never argue, as Lefkowitz claims he must as an Afrocentrist, that « history is fiction » or that evidence is not important to history. But Lefkowitz claims that Diop is constructing historical fiction according to his own taste. His tory is reduced to mere aesthetics : « The inevitable result of cultural history-writing, unless it is done with the greatest of proven fact ». Lefkowitz points out mistakes in the Afrocentric hypothesis of the ancient Greeks, but nowhere does she admit, in Bowersock's refreshing phrase, that her thesis « cannot be promulgated as proven fact ».</page><page sequence="13">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 175 caution, is a portrait of the past painted with broad strokes and bright colors of our own choosing » (p. 49). With this language Lefkowitz dismisses the freedom of choice that characterizes all forms of representation. She ignores the fact that in searching for evidence, we must choose our methods of representation, our « strokes and colors ». Whether the stro kes are too broad or the colors too bright is a matter for phi losophical decision, not historical or scientific precision. A research program must be based on a system that picks out and assigns weight to evidence. The system does not consist in a random association of facts. It is a whole campaign for dis covering and arranging facts. In the best case a research program is a campaign that we choose with deliberation rather than unconscious cultural moti ves. Research programs spring from « bright colors of our own choosing » because we must have a vivid picture of the enter prise and its possible results if we are to have the motivation necessary to carry out an arduous process. Diop's research program on the hypothesis of African origins consumed his whole life. Lefkowitz has difficulty conceiving the enormity of the work called for by an Afrocentric research program. She expects the evidence for Afrocentrism to be almost intuitively obvious to a casual researcher. She claims, for example, that it should be easy to find concrete evidence of an Egyptian influence on Greek culture in the very nature of Egyptian thought : « If the Greeks had learned their philosophy from a large theoretical literature produced by Egyptian writers, surely some trace of that literature would have remained in Egypt, and we would know the names or schools that produced it » (p. 158). In her attempts to refute Diop, Lefkowitz has already mentioned the Heliopolitan (p. 151, 152) and Memphite (p. 141) Egyptian schools. The four primary Egyptian schools of thought are well known and Hornung's Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt makes careful efforts to distinguish them. In claiming that Egyptian influence on Greek thought should be traceable in the same way that Greek influence on Roman literature has been traced, Lefkowitz ignores the fact that scholars have had access to Greek and Roman literatures since their origination. Euro pean scholarship on Egyptian texts dates back only to the first part of the 19th century (see Hegel, p. 200). Lefkowitz also passes over the fact that research takes</page><page sequence="14">176 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE money and time. Determination, « bright colors », « broad stro kes » are not enough to mount a full-scale research program. Ignoring the logistical problems Afrocentric research has faced, Lefkowitz cavalierly dismisses Afrocentrists as cultural relativists whose social commitments have blinded them to his torical evidence. She pleads for their return to the objectivist fold : « ... once we accept the idea that instead of truth, there are many truths, or different ethnic truths, we cannot hope to have an intellectual community » (p. 174). But her concept of « intellectual community » is narrowly defined, appearing to include only like-minded individuals : « This is why we cannot each remain in our own separate enclaves without talking with colleagues who share similar interests and concerns » (p. 175). Here Lefkowitz passes over the idea that if scholars had a per fect community of « similar interests and concerns », scholars hip could never advance past the limits of inherent bias. Lefkowitz fails to recognize that intellectual communities must be grounded in difference. While admitting that all scho larship risks bias, she does not emphasize the fact that bias can exist both at the level of facts and at the much deeper level of fundamental research assumptions. The extraordinary bias of European scholars against Africa, for example, should prevent scholars from looking for too much « community of interest ». Lefkowitz admits that cultural or ethnic concerns may ani mate certain kinds of research. Persons of African ancestry, for example, may be prompted to study ancient Egyptian civi lization by reason of « ethnic background » (p. 167). But Lefkowitz has only to remind herself of the effect of European ethnic concerns on African scholarship. Lefkowitz takes note of Asante's claim that ethnic concerns thwarted European scholarship on Africa. For Asante, all claims to objective knowledge are filtered through a social-cultural screen. Blinded by their enslavement of Africans, Europeans could not be objective about Africa (Asante, p. 117, quoted in Lefkowitz, p. 159). Lefkowitz glosses Asante's position aggressively, suggesting that he believes that Europeans cannot be trusted to tell the truth about Africa : « Anyone who accepts Asante's formula tion need not trust a word I have said in this book, or that anyone has said or will ever say in criticism of Afrocentrism » (p. 159).</page><page sequence="15">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 177 A more sympathetic reader of Asante would interpret his remark in the context of a specific piece of European scholars hip on Africa. Hegel's work on Africa is perhaps the single best example. Did Hegel bring his European consciouness with him whenever he discussed Africa ? In his primary research on Africa, Hegel claimed that Greece was far more sophisticated than Egypt, but also that Greece was dependent on Egyptian culture. Hegel also foreclo sed on any possibility of deep cultural connections between Egypt and Nubia, and these two areas with the rest of Africa. Hegel's research hypothesis was purely philosophical rather than historical. It was based on the Egyptomania consequent upon Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and Champollion's deciphe ring of the Rosetta stone rather than examination of African evidence9. But what are the consequences of Hegel's philosophical posi tion, immersed as it was in racist European consciousness ? Hegel proclaimed this philosophical stance in the early 1800's, and he was following up on the prior claims of Hume and Kant that « real » Africans were not capable of fully human abstrac tion10. Hegel's research program would prevent any serious research into Egyptian sophistication or connections with the rest of Africa. But Lefkowitz herself now claims that Egypt has cultural ties to other parts of Africa and that research should be conduc ted in this area. How has her own « European consciousness » changed ? Lefkowitz makes a plea for a globally enlarged consciousness that would suppress research driven by purely cultural reasons : « Rather than assume that each race... should write its own versions of history, I would [call] for a wider cosmopolitanism... which can represent a diversity of viewpoints » (p. 160). But she simply cannot accept the possi bility that the fundamental Afrocentric hypothesis of African origins should be included in her « wider cosmopolitanism ». Lefkowitz' cosmopolitanism can only be stretched so far : « There are of course many possible interpretations of the truth, but some things are simply not true » (p. 161). She cites 9. See Hegel's Philosophy of History, p. 91-99, 198-222. 10. For references to racist passages in modern European philosophy, see John Immerwahr and Michael Burke, « Race and the Modern Philosophy Course », Teaching Philosophy 16 :1 (March, 1993), p. 21-34.</page><page sequence="16">178 PRESENCE AFRICAINE the idea that there was no Holocaust as an example of some thing that simply cannot be true. But she also claims that the Afrocentric thesis is another example of something that cannot possibly be true. The difference in the kinds of research pro grams that would generate statements about the Holocaust and Afrocentrism are extraordinary, but she cites them as compa rable examples : « Likewise, it is not true that the Greeks stole their philosophy from Egypt ; rather, it is true that the Greeks were influenced in various ways over a long period of time by their contact with the Egyptians » (p. 161). Here Lefkowitz acknowledges the truth of Afrocentrism's primary claim about Greece. But she dodges the need for care ful scholarship on the extent of this influence by claiming that Egyptian culture was not sophisticated enough to influence Greek culture in major ways. She disguises the controversial nature of her claim by displacing attention onto James' radical hypothesis. Calling Greek culture a « Stolen Legacy » is a « tall tale ». On the other hand, speaking of « Egyptian influence on Greece » is « discussing a historical issue ». However, she mini mizes any possible influence : « But then, what culture at any time has not been influenced by other cultures, and what exac tly do we mean by "influence" ? » (p. 161, Lefkowitz' italics). Lefkowitz is aware that academic research programs may have social consequences, but she passes lightly over their dan gers : « Of course, teaching false information about Socrates and Aristotle will not put anyone in immediate physical dan ger » (p. 168). Such falsehoods merely deprive ancient and modern Greeks of their heritage's glory. But how can Lefkowitz pass over historical examples where teaching false information has placed people in gravest physical danger ? Perhaps she might review the consequences of Hegel's research program of African peoples. Hegel's and other Euro peans' « false information » about Africans was part and parcel of European efforts to put Africans « in immediate physical danger ». That false information stripped Africans of their heri tage. It helped destroy African possibilities. The same false image is still very powerful in contemporary consciousness, and it is in no way based on a careful examination of African life. Afrocentrism is in part a deliberate attempt on the part of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora to scrutinize that false image in detail. Guided by research programs like Hegel's, Europeans simply had no reason to examine the African evi</page><page sequence="17">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 179 dence, since it was patent to them that Africans were not human11. If Europeans used a false image of Africa to enslave Africans, what could motivate them to pay careful attention to African culture ? The effects of Hegel's anti-African animus are evident. He furnished a philosophical reason to justify European enslave ment of Africans and European empire building in the Ameri cas, Africa, and Asia. Hegel's false image of Africa celebrated the power and uniqueness of European consciousness. But what might be the effects of contemporary classicists' continuing efforts to cut Africa off from the world ? Divorcing Africa from the world provides Europeans a rea son to believe that they owe nothing to Africa if Africans contri buted nothing to European civilization's contemporary world wide expressions. Afrocentrism fights against attempts to divorce Africa from the world. On one level, Afrocentrism is the collective name for the philosophical motivation to under take research on Africa. This kind of research could not take place in academies under the influence of the anti-African sen timent rampant in the past century and in much of the present. But Africans on the continent and in the diaspora did not let the academies stop them from doing Afrocentric research in their own communities. As Lefkowitz makes clear, there are many versions of Afro centrism. Many Afrocentrists, scholars and non-scholars alike, in and out of the academies, have jumped to apparently unjus tifiable conclusions. But without the conviction that Afrocen tric research is worth pursuing, the extraordinary discoveries that are now coming out of Africa could never have taken place. 11. Hegel's racism is environmental rather than genetic. The mountai nous terrain of sub-Saharan Africa prevents the cultural intercourse neces sary for the full development of consciousness (p. 92). Claiming that Euro pean contact will bring Africans to that consciousness, Hegel goes so far as to say that slavery is « the occasion of the increase of human feeling among the Negroes » (p. 98). He admits that slavery is « injustice », but Africans can only be ready for freedom if they are « matured » (p. 99). Hence he suggests that the « gradual abolition of slavery is therefore wiser and more equitable than its sudden removal » (p. 99). Jay Lampert highlights Hegel's false consciousness : « [Hegel] does not notice that his own people are in a state of war with African peoples » (p. 51).</page><page sequence="18">180 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE CONCLUSION A brief review of the consequences of Hegel's and Lefkowitz' research programs for African life may show why Afrocentrists undertake their research with a sense of urgency. Hegel clai med that the Africa beyond Egypt is the « dark of night », the « uncontrolled natural will » (p. 91, 104). Africans lack « the category of Universality » that « naturally accompanies all our [European] ideas » (p. 93, my italics). Europeans, according to Hegel, simply can't understand Africans, because Africans can't think. For Hegel, Egyptians stand in stark contrast to Africans. Herodotus' informants, he remind us, « call the Egyptians the wisest of mankind » (p. 204). Hegel professes to be stunned to find Egyptian intelligence, organizational power, and brilliant works of art, all « in the vicinity of African stupidity » (p. 204). Amidst this anti-African barrage, however, we find a stri king passage that captures Hegel in astonishing self-contradic tion. Hegel's environmental determinism made the Nile the prime mover of African culture, and Hegel speculates that Afri can culture moved from South to North along the Nile : « With this is connected the consideration that Egypt probably recei ved its culture from Ethiopia ; principally from the island Meroe, which, according to recent hypotheses, was occupied by a sacerdotal people » (p. 201). Hegel makes this remark in an offhand, seemingly uncons cious way, as if a trick of reason suddenly forced him to under cut his attempts to separate Egypt from the rest of Africa. We should hardly be surprised to find Egyptian enlightenment « in the vicinity of African stupidity », if Africans were in fact the source of Egyptian culture. Hegel's philosophy would have halted the research that has turned his slip of the tongue into legitimate research programs. Respected archaeologists like Charles Bonnet (1990) and David O'Connor (1993) take seriously the hypothesis that Nubia - Hegel's Ethiopia - made important cultural contributions to Egypt. Their discoveries have demonstrated Nubia's cultural auto nomy and intercourse with Egypt and central Africa. Frank Yurco (1996) interprets a 6th dynasty tomb inscription (~ 2330 BCE) as evidence that Egyptians valued a central African</page><page sequence="19">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 181 culture for its music and dancing seventeen hundred years prior to the Nubian conquest of Egypt. Frank Snowden (1983, 1996) emphasizes the ancient Greek belief that the Nubian was a most enlightened Egyptian dynasty. The results of this kind of research have accumulated to the point that an « Egypt in Africa » exhibit in Indianapolis can celebrate the demise of racist research guidelines disconnecting Egypt and Africa12. But when one bad philosophy vanishes, others often take its place. Contemporary classicists like Lefkowitz and Glen Bower sock take up Hegel's old theme with a new twist. Their argu ment makes the ancient Greeks proto-Afrocentrists in the sense that Afrocentrists claim Egyptian foundations for Greek culture. As Bowersock puts it, the Greeks naively « supposed that they had borrowed from the Egyptians », but 20th century scholarship's analytical tools can prove the Afrocentric Greeks wrong. Bowersock follows Hegel in insisting that Egyptians can only be linked to black Africans in a « simple-minded geogra phical sense... Ancient Egyptians did not consider themselves Africans or blacks... » (p. 7). Lefkowitz at least admits that the Greeks portrayed Egyp tians as « what we would now call "people of color" » (p. 13). In her view, the Egyptians had significant cultural ties to Africa beyond Egypt. As we saw above, she cites as examples semi divine kingship in East Africa and « elaborate rhythmic hand clapping at festivals, which Herodotus observed during his visit to Egypt... » (p. 135). In attacking Hegel's partition of Egypt from Africa, howe ver, Lefkowitz actually steps backwards into Hegel's arms. She repudiates Hegel's segregration of Egypt from Africa but accen tuates Egypt's separation from Greece. While admitting that Egyptians influenced Greeks « in various ways over a long period of time » (p. 161), she insists that Egypt cannot be connected to Greece in any foundational way. In making Egypt African and separating Egypt from Greece, she reaffirms Hegel's conviction in a new way : Not out of Africa ! Philosophies like Hegel's have inspired Europeans to neglect 12.

See also another recent exhibition catalog, The American Discovery of Ancient Egypt (Scott, 1995).</page><page sequence="20">182 PRESENCE AFRICAINE research in the Africa outside of Egypt for nearly two centuries. Bonnet (1996) contrasts the large numbers of archaeologists working in Egypt with the ten now working in Nubia. If resear chers believe that Africa contributed little to Greece by way of Egypt, they will hardly look for Africa's foundational contri bùtions to non-Greek cultures. Hegel and Lefkowitz's research philosophy would stop the investigation that will disclose a new « Egypt in Africa ». It would also prevent research from moving beyond « Egypt in Africa » to explore « Africa in the World ». Freed from the presuppositions of Hegel and his followers, research on « Africa in the World » will pursue questions like these : • Do great civilizations spring into being through immacu late conception or evolve gradually through cultural diffusion ? • Do modern cultures evolve from limited numbers of ancient cultures in the same way that modern humans seem to have evolved from small populations in Africa ? • Could the rest of Africa have given as much to Egypt through cultural diffusion as Egypt might have given to Greece ? • Did ancient Africans develop philosophies that may been passed on to the rest of the world through Egyptian civiliza tion ? Bonnet and O'Connor's work cited above and Erik Hor nung's (1981) respected claims about the sophistication of ancient Egyptian ontology provide a scholarly impetus for pur suing these questions. Merritt Ruhlen (1991), Cohn Renfrew (1992, 1994), and Luigi Cavalli-Sforza's (1981, 1991) work legi timizes « Out of Africa » research programs in linguistics and biology as well as archaeology. While these researchers would not call themselves « Afrocentrists », they share a conviction about African research best expressed by Wittgenstein's para doxical epigram : « Don't think. Look. » (1958 : 66). Afrocentrists are taking bold steps to help reverse long standing efforts to make research serve racism. The Afrocen tric research program founded by Diop distinctively models the uses of research against racism. Lefkowitz' criticism of that program has led her to hypothesize that Egyptians are what she would call « people of color », that Egypt is an African culture, that the Greeks were influenced by the Egyptians over long periods of time in many ways, and that the Greeks were</page><page sequence="21">IN AND OUT OF AFRICA 183 the first Afrocentrists. These hypotheses show how much she has overcome Hegel's European racism. Lefkowitz' claim that she will always teach her students about the Afrocentric paradigm in the future (p. 164) shows the power of Afrocentrism in action — even in the minds of its most ardent critics. Not Out of Africa has helped bring Afro centrism to the surface of American consciousness. Charles C. VERHAREN REFERENCES ASANTE, Molefi (1990). Kernet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge.
