Current interpreters of the apsidal mosaic of Santa Pudenziana unanimously agree with earlier scholars in identifying the seated figure as Christ and in stressing the conscious use of imperial motifs to express the theme of Christus-rex or Christus-iudex.' In forming such an inter- pretation on the basis of parallel Christian and imperial images there is a danger of the "dictionary fallacy" in which there is assumed a one-to- one relationship between sign and significance even though the total context may alone provide the meaning of the details so industriously catalogued. Anthony Cutler has discussed this problem of art historians and neatly summarized the point by quoting V. A. Kolve: "It is content alone that turns a sign into communication, limiting its possibilities, defining its exact and immediate intent." 2 It is clear from the nature of this decoration that the underlying motif reflects the Christian faith of a Roman congregation during the years 402 and 417. I have pointed out elsewhere that a text at the bottom of the mosaic, no longer extant but recoverable from a transcription Pan- vinio made before 1588, dates the dedication of the mosaic Sal(uo) Innocen(tio), and hence I have argued that the mosaic dates to the pon- tificate of Innocent I (402-417) and commemorates the escape of the church building from the destruction of the sack of Rome in 410 and therefore is to be dated to the period of 410 to 417.3 Whatever the cogency of these assertions they at least suggest the milieu in which the mosaic was created. An inventory of distinctive features of the mosaic points to images derived originally from Ez. 1.4-28 but also utilized in Rev. 4. Critics quite aware of the Old Testament source deduce from the mosaic a reference to the text of Ezechiel in which the prophet records his vision of the Lord who foretells the destruction of Jerusalem. The chief elements pictured in the mosaic are the four creatures, the throne, and the seated figure. The deduction, then, is that the mosaic is a parallel</page><page sequence="2">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA 277 0 N 0 o 0 4) *C CO ? s?</page><page sequence="3">FREDRIC W.

Hence, the seated figure is Christ the judge at the end of the world, as foretold in the gospels. If this identification is correct, it presumably springs from the understanding of the text in Ezechiel and Revelation that was current in Rome at the time the mosaic program was designed. There is evidence of the interest the text of Ezechiel evoked in Chris- tian circles of Rome, particularly in those connected with Jerome. Jerome by 380 had yielded to the importunities of Vincentius and had translated fourteen homilies of Origen on the text of Ezechiel specifically for a Roman audience.4 Some thirty years later in 410 he apologized for his delay in delivering a full commentary on Ezechiel which he had often promised, and the first installment was quickly made available to friends in Rome.5 Christians there were drawn to the Old Testament prophets who communicated the threatened destruction of Jerusalem and lamented its fall. The metaphor of Jerusalem and Troy for the Rome of the early fifth century gave texts like Ezechiel a painful appositeness to the Roman reader.6 An apocalyptic age pondered these parallels and anxiously wondered about the future of Rome. The situation, therefore, fostered a particular interest in such sections of scripture as Ezechiel provided. The viewer of the mosaic in Santa Pudenziana quickly notes several features justifying the connection with the text of Ezechiel. The upper zone with the four creatures in the sky and the majestic figure seated on a throne recall images employed in Ez. 1. The careful reader of that text would know that what is portrayed in the mosaic is in some sense a presentation of the visiones Dei Ezechiel had seen. The mosaic artist is not attempting on his own to represent the invisible grandeur of God, but he is skillfully employing a theophany to a prophet which by its biblical precedent justifies the bold enterprise of picturing the mystery of God. The scene portrayed is taken out of the realm of the perceptible world and quoted from an unimpeachable source to avoid the strictures of the Christian writers who denied that the invisible God could be por- trayed visibly.7 The reliance of the mosaic on Ezechiel is not slavish and shows the same tendency by which the Church as early as Revelation had com- bined the vision of Is. 6 and Ez. 1. The creatures of Isaiah with their six wings and covered faces and the four figures of Ezechiel with their four uncovered faces and four wings and four wheels have been com- 279</page><page sequence="5">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. bined in Rev. 4 into a composite of the four creatures of Ezechiel with the six wings of Isaiah's chanting seraphim. The persistence of this amalgam is clear in the Stuma flabellum, a silver liturgical fan in the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul, dating from the sixth century and named after the place near Aleppo where it was found. On it is engraved the tetramorph with the wheels of Ezechiel as well as the human hands but with the six wings of Isaiah engaged as the prophet describes them: with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew (Is. 6.2). The face and feet which are partially shown are understood apparently as covered by the wings.8 The presence of elements from diverse description demonstrates the assimilation that had occurred and the freedom with which elements were combined. The other pictorial theme is the centrally seated figure. The text of Ezechiel in its Old Testament context makes it clear that the elaborate appearance described in 1.26-28 was "the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." What is also clear is that the patristic exegesis of this passage understands this Lord to be the Father of the New Testa- ment Trinity. Origen is quite explicit: habes sedentem Dominum in Jerusalem, and Jerome in his own commentary is emphatic about this interpretation: Hominem autem Deum Patrem debere intelligi multa docent testimonia.' When he does find the presence of Christ in Ezechiel's vision, it is not in the seated figure but in the person of Ezechiel, the son of Buzi, who is seeing the vision: Porro 'Buzi' in linguam nostram uertitur 'spretus' atque 'contemptus, 'Hiezechiel' 'roboratus a Deo'. Quod sic Domino coaptabitur, ut dicamus Creatorem mundi quia Pater est Saluatoris, ab omnibus haereticis sperni atque contemni qui uetus non recipiunt testamentum. Nec mirum robustum Dei esse Dominum cum ipse sit Dei uirtus Deique sapientia. ' In this interpretation Jerome follows the same one he had known some thirty years before in his translation from Origen.11 The general tendency of Christian readers in making this identifica- tion is further reflected in the adapted use of this vision in Rev. 4, where the one seen seated on the throne is distinct from Christ who com- municates with John (Rev. 1.12-16). Victorinus of Pettau, the earliest extant exegete of the Latin west, leaves no doubt about this under- standing of the text of Revelation: Christ in 1.13, and the Father in 4.6.'2 The text in Revelation was also connected by patristic exegesis with the so-called seventh vision in Dan. 7.1-10. Jerome in commenting on verse nine quotes Rev. 4.1-6, with the observation: simile quid et in 280</page><page sequence="6">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA Ioannis Apocalypse legimus and makes the same distinction between the Father and Son: Vetustus autem dierum ille est qui apud Ioannem solus in throno sedit; Filius quoque hominis, qui uenit ad uetustum dierum, ipse est qui apud loannem: Leo dicitur de tribu Iuda, radix Dauid, et cetera his similia.'3 In all these passages the image of the Father is anthropomorphic, a daring representation justified by the visionary context of the seer. Another motif prominent in the mosaic is the throne from which the seated figure presides. The prototype of this feature is again the vision of Ezechiel with its similitudo throni (Ez. 1.26). Jerome notes in his comments on this passage the precedents for images of thrones in the Old and New Testament. The jewels encrusting this throne in Ezechiel Jerome likewise finds elsewhere in scripture as attributes of the glory of God or of the Heavenly Jerusalem.14 Such a throne seems to bear some common attributes with representations of the imperial throne from Diocletian through the Constantinian dynasty, but it noticeably differs from that in the period of Theodosius, nearer in time to the mosaic.'5 That the pictorial details for the throne represented in the mosaic spring primarily from the biblical text needs to be emphasized without, of course, denying that the artistic idiom in which the throne is represented may borrow from imperial iconography. The similarities found between the mosaic throne and the imperial throne have subtly influenced critics to conclude that not only is the pictorial idiom similar, but that the iden- tity of the seated figure depends on the imperial metaphor. Hence, since the figure in the mosaic sits upon an imperial throne, he must be Christ, as the parallel to the Roman emperor, and as another instance in which an enthroned Christ sits among his apostles. Certainly there are numerous examples of the latter scene which employ the imperial iconography in representing Christ. However, when the context does not spring from a New Testament assertion about Christ but from a clearly quoted vision from the Old Testament, the identification of the seated figure cannot be made on the basis a pictorial equation between Christ and the emperor. The first assertion in interpreting the mosaic is that the artist has cleverly recreated and adapted the vision of Ezechiel and in so doing has dared to picture the Father enthroned in the center of the composition, artistically translating a text in which contemporary Roman Christians were interested. If this were as far as the present analysis proceeds, it would merely 281</page><page sequence="7">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. show that the seated figure is not Christ but the Father, and this would be the only modification in the Christus-rex or Christus-iudex favored by the critics. The apocalyptic context would still be there with its reference to God's judgment in Ezechiel decreeing and foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem. Jerome leaves no doubt that he understood the experience of the prophet in Ez. 4 as an indication of the forth- coming destruction of Jerusalem: typum esse prophetam futurae obsi- dionis urbis Hierusalem.'6 The chronology Jerome outlines shows that he understands that the prophet Ezechiel is foretelling the conditions in Jerusalem in the reign of Sedecias sub quo capta est Hierusalem templumque destructum. 7 His explanation of Ez. 24.1-14, shows that his preferred interpretation is that the prophecy is dealing with this historical context, but among other interpretations he notes: sunt qui, iuxta tropologiam, totum locum istum ad consummationem mundi transferant.' Consequently, modern critics who see in the mosaic the divine judgment foretold by Ezechiel have a firm foundation in the interpretations of Jerome's contemporaries who saw the prophesied destruction of Jerusalem as a metaphor for the Last Judgment. However, the presence of another motif in the mosaic suggests a fur- ther interpretation. The figure is seated against the background of a cur- ving wall containing several opened gates, and beyond this structure are seen the buildings of Jerusalem.'9 The pictured locale is crucial for understanding the mosaic. The vision of Ezechiel, so far treated, was granted the prophet on the banks of the Chobar in Babylonia, and his vision was a vision of the heavens: aperti sunt caeli et uidi uisiones Dei (Ez. 1.1).20 There is no mention of wall, gates, and buildings in this vision. These features, however, are found in a much later passage reporting a quite distinct vision (Ez. 40-43). In this later vision Ezechiel was transported to the land of Israel and set down upon a very high mountain on which was a structure like a city (Ez. 40.1-2). Jerome clarifies the general import of the whole vision: the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and, in particular, the reconstruction of the temple. This vision looks beyond the destruction foretold in the first vision to reconstructing the temple on a scale that would outshine the glory of Solomon's structure.21 Jerome's version of this text is Et uidi uisionem secundum speciem quam uideram quando uenit ut disperderet ciuitatem et species secundum aspectum quem uideram iuxta fluuium Chobar, et cecidi super faciem meam. In explaining the first part of this verse, Jerome involves the man whose appearance was recorded in Ez. 9.2-3, 282</page><page sequence="8">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA in the context of a vision which included the appearance of the animal with the four faces: the face of a cherub, of a man, of a lion, and of an eagle (Ez. 10.14). Jerome is quick to insist that these are the same four faces mentioned in the opening vision of the prophet (Ez. 1.10) although the present text speaks of the face of a cherub rather than the face of an ox: Unam autem faciem, id est primam, appellauit Cherub, pro qua supra dixeratfacies uituli, ex quo intelligiturfaciem Cherub essefaciem uituli. Quorum omnium sensum praeteritae uisionis continet explanatio.22 His final remark in this citation gives the general principle that all visions which incorporate elements from the vision of the Chobar are to be understood in terms of the opening vision. Hence, it is not surprising that he has no further comment on the second part of Ez. 43.4: et species secundum aspectum quem uideram iuxta fluuium Chobar. The only essential difference between the two visions is the locale and the time, between the vision on the banks of the Chobar before the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple and the vision at the site of Jerusalem prophetically rebuilt. The importance of these distinc- tions is fundamental for understanding the mosaic. Critics are correct in finding the basic framework of the mosaic in Ezechiel, but they err in finding the controlling text in Ez. 1-7 rather than in Ez. 40-48. This shift from the apocalyptic terror of Jerusalem's destruction to the joy of its glorious restoration is one that Hernegger has noted in the iconography of the fourth century, from the eschatology in which the final judgment ushers in the triumph of the Church to an eschatology in which the Church already, to some degree, shares in the triumph of Christ.23 Jerome so uneasy over the exegetical task of interpreting Ez. 40-48 likens his reaction to his boyhood experience of the murky terror of the catacombs, but yet he realizes that the interpretation of these chapters on the temple, which was never built, has a present reality in the Church; et nos referimus ad Christi ecclesiam et cotidie in sanctis aedificari cerno.24 When Jerome begins to describe Ezechiel's vision of the rebuilt tem- ple, he tries to reconstruct from the text the first architectural feature that caught the prophet's eye, and it is the circuit wall around the temple area: Videamus igitur, quid ingressus Hiezechiel aedificium ciuitatis uergentis ad austrum primum uiderit, deinde audierit: Et ecce, inquit, murus forinsecus in circuitu domus undique.25 After a minute descrip- tion of the exterior dimensions of the wall which forms a square with each side measuring five hundred calami, which Jerome totals to 2,000 283</page><page sequence="9">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. and translates into 12,333 1/3 cubits, he gives this striking explanation of the numerology involved: Omnis autem murus qui est exterior et habet spatiosissimam longitudinem et latitudinem per quadrum apostolorum continet numerum, id est duodecim milium - ut singulis apostolis millenus numerus deputetur - et tamen ad mensuram plenitudinis Christi et perfecti uiri non ueniat, nisi iungatur ei et Tra2a~as: qui trecentos triginta et tres facit cubitos et cubiti tertiam partem: per quae sanctae et uenerabilis Trinitatis mysterium demonstratur, quae cingit et uallat omnia et habitores templi sui praestat tutissimos.26 The symbolism of the walls in this vision yields a reference in Jerome's exegesis to the Trinity and the twelve apostles. At this point Ezechiel is brought to the gate facing east and is lifted from outside the gate and brought into the interior where he sees the glory of the Lord fill the temple in a vision that repeats the earlier one on the Chobar. The next pertinent item in the prophet's vision is the gate which faces east and is closed, but before it someday will sit the princeps. In his explanation Jerome identifies the princeps as Christ before whose incarnation the meaning of the law and prophets and paradise itself were closed, but postquam autem ille pependit in cruce... statim uelum templi scissum est et aperta sunt omnia; ablatoque uelamine dicimus: Nos autem omnes reuelatafacie gloriam Domini con- templantes, in eandem imaginem transformamur a gloria in gloriam.27 Christ is the prince who alone sits in the gate and eats bread before the Lord quia substantia eius diuinaque natura a cunctis creaturarum substantiis separata est, but he goes in and out the gate ut secum introducat eos qui absque doctrina eius et auxilio intrare non possunt. 28 Significantly Jerome remarks on the appropriateness of Christ being here portrayed as the one who alone has the bread of perfect and com- plete knowledge since he finds this a restatement of the Johannine text: Deum nemo vidit umquam nisi unigenitus Filius (Jn. 1.18) and the Mat- thaean text: Nemo enim nouit Filium nisi Pater, et nemo nouit Patrem nisi Filius et cui uoluerit Filius reuelare (Mt. 11.27). An inventory of images, suggested by the text of Ezechiel and Jerome's interpretation and, by supposition, illustrated in the mosaic, includes a depiction of the Trinity in the new and heavenly Jerusalem with the Father seated on the throne before a closed gate that is opened by the crucified Christ and in the presence of the twelve apostles who are literally translated from the symbolism of the four walls of the tem- ple enclosure. Also included is the mysterious animal with the four 284</page><page sequence="10">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA faces. Since the prophet sees his vision in the east, the setting should include the sky of dawn. The commentary's emphasis on the Trinity poses a pictorial problem for the mosaicist who has circumscribed his scene by the vision of an Old Testament prophet. The identity of the Father can be drawn from the Lord seated upon the throne. An allusion to the Son can be deduced from the supposed presence of the closed gate, possibly behind the enthroned figure, but pictorially such a mode of representation is inade- quate. The mosaic intends its explicit statement about Christ in the representation of the great jewelled cross pictured on the hill rising behind the temple walls. The pictured mountain is, because of the association with the cross, identified with Golgotha. However, if the mosaicist is following Jerome here as elsewhere, this identification is questionable. Ez. 11.23 describes how the glory of the Lord abandoned Jerusalem and stood upon a mountain on the east side of the city. This second of Ezechiel's visions is connected with the first (Ez. 1-7) as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the abandonment and destruction of Jerusalem, but it is also resumed in the final vision which speaks of the mountain at the east of the city (Ez. 40.2; 44.1) in the prophesied restoration. Jerome finds in this verse an unmistakable reference to the Mount of Olives: stat super montem qui est ad orientem urbis - haud dubium quin montem significet Oliueti unde Saluator ascendit ad Patrem. 29 This location fits neatly with the eastern location of the vision already insisted upon. The apparent connection of this site with the Ascension of Christ seems to exclude the presence of the cross atop it, as in the mosaic, or to suggest that the hill is Golgotha instead. How- ever, Jerome, while fully aware that the Mount of Olives is in signum resurrectionis et luminis, surprisingly connects it with the cross: Mirum- que in modum usque in praesentem diem gloria Domini, quae deseruit templum, stat super montem Oliueti et, in signo crucis rutilans, spectat templum quondam iudaicum, in fauillas et cineres dissolutum.30 This identification by reason of place leaves in doubt that the mosaic con- tains a pictorial reference to the apparition in 351 in the area of Golgotha, recounted to the Emperor Constantius by Cyril of Jerusalem.31 By reasons of time and place the representation cannot refer to the golden reliquary of the cross erected on Golgotha by Theodosius II no earlier than 420. There is no reason to doubt the accepted dates for either the mosaic or the reliquary.32 Prescinding from the identification of the hill, the jewelled cross is the symbol of the Son 285</page><page sequence="11">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. in the trinitarian motif of the mosaic, evocatively located in terms of Ezechiel's prophesied temple. If the arguments are valid which see in the mosaic a representation of the Father and the Son, the viewer expects in the aftermath of the Council of Constantinople in 381, which declared the trinitarian status of the Holy Spirit, a representation of the Third Person. Wilpert witnesses to this expectation when he postulates that the destroyed upper rim of the mosaic contained in the center the Hand of God, which for him is the representation of the Father.33 Thus the Trinity would be pictured by this symbol of the Father, by the Son seated on the throne, and the dove which formerly appeared beneath the footstool. This is an area of the mosaic destroyed in the renovation of 1711, but known from the sketch of the mosaic made by Ciacconio in 1595.34 This sketch showed the monogram of Adrian and beneath it the dove of the Holy Spirit and the Lamb of the Apocalypse symbolizing Christ. However, the presence of the monogram of Adrian I (771-795) shows, at a minimum, that this area of the mosaic was altered and presents the possibility that the section showing the dove and the lamb was an addi- tion to the original mosaic introduced by Adrian in his restorations.35 This possibility seems reinforced by the lack of centering the placing of these elements and by their intrusion into the main compositional band.36 They are not here, as elsewhere, in a self-contained horizontal band which expresses abstractly the figural representation in the main decoration. When G. B. de Rossi insists not only on the lamb, as sket- ched by Ciacconio, but in addition that the lamb must have originally stood upon a mountain from which issued four symbolic rivers to which harts and sheep approached on either side, his reasoning is a priori "ricorrendo al paragone colle simili opere ed attendoci agli insegnamenti autorevoli della tradizione costante dell'arte cristiana." 37 But this representation is not traditional at the time of Santa Pudenziana. The use of the lamb frieze in apsidal decoration as an allegorical restatement of an upper scene probably originated in the mosaic of S. Pietro, but the evidence is uncertain. The composition is known only through sketches made under the direction of G. Grimaldi in 1592 before its destruction in the building of the present basilica. In these sketches the lower zone, again a parallel restatement of the larger decoration, contains at least some alterations introduced by Innocent III prior to 1216. However, these alterations were made on mosaics 286</page><page sequence="12">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA which no longer were identical with the fourth century originals and by 640 had been in ruins when Severinus redecorated the apse.38 Their iconography which apparently showed an elaboration of the dove and lamb motif is uncertain and only by hypothesis can they be taken as a mandatory prototype for Santa Pudenziana. The Lateran mosaic in its lower zone is only minimally related to the dove and the apocalyptic lamb. Its complex history ended with the demolition of 1876 when it was replaced by a reasonably exact copy of the mosaic as modified by Torriti in 1290. Torriti was working with a mosaic basically intact from the fourth century. The lower zone pertinent to our discussion contained a dove from which descended rays upon a jewelled cross with a central medallion showing the baptism of Jesus. The cross stands upon a hill from which issued four streams and between the second and third streams was an elaborate composition within a towered city with jewelled walls. On either side of the rivers were three sheep and a hart. There seems no reason to doubt the antiquity of this section of the mosaic.39 However, again it offers no compelling prototype for the dove and lamb ensemble in Santa Pudenziana. The only apsidal parallel that might be adduced is the mosaic in the basilicas of Cimitile and Fundi which are known to us only through the description deduced from the verses of Paulinus of Nola.40 In both mosaics the full symbolism of lamb, dove, sheep, rivers, and throne is present. The actual placing of these elements at Cimitile is difficult to reconstruct, but in G. Bandmann's reconstruction the lamb motif is united with the cross, apparently forming a single unit in a totally non- figural mosaic. At Fundi the lamb motif in any reconstruction is part of the central design and not an independent and parallel design. Fur- thermore, Hellemo in a careful analysis has shown that the scriptural inspiration for these motifs derives from Revelation, and while the trinitarian elements are present, the emphasis is Christological. The discrepancy between these mosaics and Santa Pudenziana is a matter of both the scriptural context and the theological emphasis. It should also be noted that these designs are dated between 400 and 403, not a com- manding precedent for the mosaics in Santa Pudenziana dating to 410 to 417. The examination of the dove and lamb found in Ciacconio's sketch leads to two possible conclusions. First, if it was part of the original design, it can, granting the Hand of God demanded by Wilpert, be simply a parallel abstraction of the trinitarian representation in the main 287</page><page sequence="13">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. portion of the apse and hence offer no difficulty to the interpretation we have given to the extant part of the mosaic. If the Hand of God is rejected as a gratuitous assumption, then the image of the Father may well be, as in our interpretation, the enthroned figure, and here again there is no disagreement with the interpretation of the mosaic. Secondly, if the lamb and the dove are an abstract restatement of the main zone, then the Spirit must be represented in some way in the main section of the mosaic. Again, it would be necessary to postulate the Hand of God but this time as an image of the Spirit. The following argument, it is hoped, will demonstrate how unnecessary it is to look beyond the extant mosaic for the representation of the Holy Spirit. The representation of the Holy Spirit is perhaps the most complicated part of the iconography for the modern viewer because the explanation to be offered at first glance is a misfit with the accepted symbolism of the Holy Spirit. The success with which artists appropriated the dove from the gospel account of the baptism of Jesus has made it for modern viewers the normative symbol of the Holy Spirit.4' Combined with the figure of the baptized Christ and the Father, represented as a voice from heaven or as the manus Dei, the dove from the early days of Christian iconography had been seen as the Holy Spirit. However, it is precisely the controlling trinitarian context which guarantees this meaning of the dove which elsewhere signifies a variety of meanings.42 What is here sug- gested is that we look for the symbol of the Holy Spirit in the luminous clouds of the mosaic of Santa Pudenziana, and what is here maintained is that the later exclusive symbolism of the dove as the Holy Spirit had not at this period excluded the possibility that the Holy Spirit might be otherwise represented.43 As Anthony Cutler has noted, such a new explanation must be governed by the twin notions of explicability (embodiment in a text) and representativeness (the degree to which the problematical example departs from the norm).44 Christian writers from the time of Origen show that the literary tradi- tion accepted in certain contexts the connection between the luminous cloud and the Holy Spirit. In applying his triple method of interpreting the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory (Mt.24.30), Origen proposes that the clouds allegorically may be considered as either the uirtus altissimi et spiritus sanctus or the scrip- tures of the prophets and the apostles which reveal Christ.45 The fuller implications of this first meaning of clouds Origen explains in the appropriate setting of the Transfiguration, as recounted in Mt. 288</page><page sequence="14">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA 17.1-8.46 He develops the trinitarian aspects of the episode by attributing the bright cloud equally to the Father, Son, and Spirit, and by insisting that the three tabernacles proposed by Peter properly per- tain to them. But while suggesting that the image of the cloud can apply to all three, Origen explains that it is the Spirit which overshadows and proclaims while the Father exhorts those who have been overshadowed, and by implication the Spirit is more closely connected with the cloud. The limiting of the cloud to signify the Holy Spirit receives a fuller statement in Origen's comments on Jer. 10.13, where he takes the words about the mist rising from the ends of the earth as a description of clouds as bearers of rain and therefore as symbols of the saints who under the guidance of the Holy Spirit proclaim the truth, as did Moses and Isaiah, Paul and the other apostles.47 For Ambrose the cloud that overshadows at the Transfiguration (Lk. 9.34) is the Holy Spirit and does not darken but reveals and is the result of the uirtus Altissimi which voices the declaration about the Son. Ambrose further contrasts this luminous cloud with a cloud of volcanic ash and summarizes the function of the cloud at the Transfiguration: de qua mentes hominum uoce dei omnipotentis emissafide ros rigauit. 8 Latin writers are not unaware of Origen's interpretation of the clouds as the prophets and apostles who in scripture proclaim the word of God. Jerome, while making use of the imagery of the cloud as the carrier of rain, says: Scimus nubes prophetas, quibus praecepit Deus ne pluerent super Israhel imbrem, quando impleuerunt mensuram patrum suorum etfacta est lex et prophetae usque ad Iohannem Baptistam. et quia Deus posuit in ecclesia primum apostolos, secundo prophetas, non solum prophetae, sed et apostoli nubes intellegendi sunt.49 Augustine's usage conforms with the same interpretation. He notes the cloud is the source of lightning and the cloud from which the lightning issues refers to the apostles who in their miracles flash forth, revealing the splendor of the truth hidden in the clouds.50 Jerome fuses all these explanations of clouds in his treatment of the four creatures. Among the interpretations he lists for the Septuagint reading of Ez. 1.4, which describes the great cloud with the brightness round it and fire flashing forth, is one that sees in the image, not a prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, but a good sign: Qui autem in contrariam partem sentiunt, hoc est bonam, spiritum auferentem siue extollentem, Spiritum sanctum intelligunt qui auferat ab hominibus uitia atque peccata, siue iacentes attollat ad sublimia.51 In this setting 289</page><page sequence="15">FREDRIC W. SCHIATTER, S.J. the four living creatures appear (Ez. 1.10) in the order in which they are seen in the mosaic and not in the order described in Rev. 4.6-7. Jerome states their significance: Facies principia dicit euangeliorum, e quibus homo et leo, hoc est natiuitas Christi et prophetae uox tonantis in eremo, dextras partes tenent; uituli autem, id est uictimarum et sacer- dotii Iudaeorum, in sinistris est, quod abolitum transiuit ad sacerdotium spirituale de quo dictum est: Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedec, ita dumtaxat ut omnia sibi haereant unoque cor- pore censeantur; aquila autem, quae est super natiuitatem, et super pro- phetiam est quae Domini expletur aduentu et super sacerdotium quod praeteriit, et extra haec omnia est, de natiuitate referens spiritali, quomodo Pater in Filio et Filius in Patre sit, de qua rectissime dicitur: Generationem eius quis enarrabit?52 The burning coals of fire (Ez. 1.14) connected with the four creatures, as symbols of the gospels, elicit the comment: Totum autem corpus et dorsa plena oculis approbabit qui uiderit nihil esse in euangeliis quod non luceat et splendore suo mundum illuminet, ut etiam quae paruaputantur et uilia, Spiritus sanctifulgeant maiestate.53 These commentaries witness to an adaptation of a figurative under- standing of the clouds which are such a striking feature of the mosaic. The glowing clouds are the Holy Spirit out of whose fiery light the pro- phets spoke in the Old Testament, and it is from the majesty of this Spirit that the gospels proclaim the mystery of the Father and the Son. From the literary sources it is clear that the symbolism of the clouds is valid only when they are joined with a trinitarian theme involving the proclamation of prophets, apostles, and evangelists. In making com- parisons of this kind patristic writers "involuntarily invited the image- makers to do the same thing."54 The clouds, however, never became an independent, fixed symbol of the Holy Spirit in the dictionary of metaphors, as did the dove. At a time when the iconography of the Spirit was far from fixed, the use of the cloud motif cannot be rejected simply because it departs from the norm. The dove at this period was not the normative symbol for the Spirit either in the patristic texts or in the way the dove was employed as a symbol. The mosaic has a complex iconography to which the key is essentially its basis in the text of Ezechiel as understood in the circle of Jerome's admirers in Rome after the catastrophe of 410. By employing the prophet's vision the mosaicist55 was able to picture the Father in a likeness of the human form with a careful boldness unparalleled in 290</page><page sequence="16">INTERPRETING THE MOSAIC OF SANTA PUDENZIANA Christian art because of his cautious adherence to the dominant features of the Old Testament vision. Skillfully making use of Ezechiel's final vision, which incorporated the features of the first vision, the mosaicist chose to picture a moment of triumph when the prophet pictures a glorious future in which God will again dwell in Jerusalem in a temple grander than Solomon's. The vision provides elements to depict sym- bolically the Spirit proclaiming through the evangelists the mystery of Christ who is indicated by the jewelled cross. The problem with previous interpretations was the starting-point which in recognizing certain artistic idioms drawn from the imperial repertoire confused the some- times imperial medium with the quite biblical message. The artistic proposition is not stated in terms of an imperial metaphor but in one that is primarily preoccupied with a biblical message and only inciden- tally employs some motifs found in the contemporary imperial iconography. Even in these motifs the imperial prototypes are few. The throne pictured in the mosaic is not noticeably dependent on the extant sculptural and numismatic paradigms of the late fourth century, and the clothing of the enthroned figure is quite unlike fourth century imperial and consular fashions. The beard of the enthroned person is not normal for emperors during the same period.56 The architectural setting is not the Basilica Caelestis oder Kaiserpalast5 nor is the assembly of seated apostles derived primarily from an imperial consistorium of bishops, when sitting at the right and the left hand of the Father and the Son is such as well-established New Testament idiom.58 The predominance of the biblical motifs shows how incidental to the composition is the iconography of imperial Rome. Similarly misleading is the insistence on interpreting the mosaic on the basis of sarcophagi and frescoes showing Christ with two or more of his apostles which do represent a traditio legis or some kind of Lehrversamm- lung. Not every seated figure in this context is Christ, as we have shown, and it is not the iconography that alone determines the iden- tification but primarily the context established by the biblical quotation and its contemporary understanding. Our awareness that in the centuries preceding the mosaic in Santa Pudenziana Christians had come to borrow items found in imperial art should not lead to the confusion that they were equating the concept of their God with the status of a Roman emperor or, even after Constan- tine's conversion, were raising the status of the emperor to some new height. Frequently in employing these artistic idioms they were rejecting 291</page><page sequence="17">FREDRIC W. SCHLATTER, S.J. the claims of both emperor and Jupiter. The Christians who even in the post-Constantinian era, particularly in the Latin west, anguished over the corruption of the Christian message by the use of words laden with secular and pagan overtones were not likely to encourage artists they employed to adopt an idiom in art that would run the parallel risk of changing the uniqueness of their God by clothing him in the garments of Caesar. At least in the late fourth and early fifth century Christians were not simply despoiling pagan art of a superior accomplishment but were making significant statements about the relationship between God and Caesar, the political and the religious order, Christianity and Classical culture. The well-known expressions of Augustine and Jerome in this matter show how critically and sensitively and scrupulously the Latin west confronted the complex culture of the Roman Empire. Interestingly Grabar has spoken of the close relationship that iconography bears with language: "Iconography constructs an image as one builds up a sentence or a discourse, by using elements of different origin and combining them according to practices comparable to the rules of grammar."59 By the time of the mosaic in Santa Pudenziana Roman Christianity had learned the idiom of Roman culture and "was free to develop more fully its own syntax."60 The failure of some art historians to take into account this growth in Christian usage during the fourth century blinds them to the evolution in the articulation of Christianity. Monuments, such as the mosaic of Santa Pudenziana, are not simply examples of late antique art to be interpreted automatically according to the canons of an imperial and early Christian iconography.

The absence of the monogram in the two seventeenth century depictions of the mosaic is problematic, and its implications deserve examination.

How presumptuous such reasoning can be is seen in the case of the nearly contemporary mosaic of S. Aquilino in Milan in which a similar theme of waters pouring forth from the hill on which the lamb stands was postulated by restorers and art historians. However, when the mosaic was cleaned, a capsa with six codices was revealed as the original composition. See G. Bovini, I mosaici del S.

Leclercq, Esprit (Le Saint-), Dictionnaire d'archeol. chrdt. et de lit. 5.1.525-529. Significantly the dictionary has no entry s. v. nuage or nude. For western medieval art L. Reau has a perceptive summary on the iconography of the Holy Spirit and an unsupported but intriguing observation: "Dans la Transfiguration, il [le Saint-Esprit] est present sous la forme d'une nuee lumineuse qui enveloppe le Christ. Spiritus fuit nubes lucida in die Transfigurationis," Iconographie de lart chrdtien, 2.2 (Paris 1956) 12. 42 See the diverse roles of the dove listed by J. P. Kirsch in Dictionnaire d'archdol. chrdt. et de lit. 3.2.2203-2231. To his list of catacomb ciphers may be added the ring of twelve doves in the mosaic of Paulinus' basilica at Cimitile where the doves signify the apostles. See G.

Cutler that "the more elaborate the creation, the more it is likely to represent the interest of others beyond the craftsman: first of course, his client; then this patron's associates, his 'circle.'" See Authentic Iconography: Ptolemy and Hermes in Malibu, Ca. [abstract], Abstracts and Program Statements for Art History Sessions (New York 1986) 28, cited by E. S. Malbon, The Iconography of the Sarcophage of Junius Bassus (Princeton 1991) 219-220, note 6. 56 For examples of imperial thrones see R. Delbrueck, Antike Porphyrwerke (Berlin 1932) 96-98, Tafel 40-41, 67; and compare with the throne as portrayed in the Missorium of Theodosius. The costume of the enthroned figure in the mosaic of Santa Pudenziana is decidedly not imperial. See R. Delbrueck, op. cit., 97. At best the costume is acceptable for those of respectable family background. St. Augustine comments on this style: talares et manicatas tunicas habere apud Romanos ueteres flagitium erat, nunc autem honesto loco natis, cum tunicati sunt, non eas habere flagitium est. De doctrina christ. 3.12.20 (CCSL 32, 90, 46-48). The full beard is not at this time normal imperial style. See. R.
