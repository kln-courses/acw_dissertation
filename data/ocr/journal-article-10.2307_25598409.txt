<plain_text><page sequence="1">CIVIL WAR AND SUCCESSION CRISIS IN ROMAN BEEKEEPING They were not slaves to tyranny Nor nil'd by wild Democracy; But Kings, that could not wrong, because Their Power was circumscribed by Laws. Bernard Mandeville, The Fable of the Bees, or, private vices, publick benefits (1723) They are quite a model community, for they respect their Queen and kill their un employed. Robert Baden-Powell, Scouting for Boys (1908) The complexity of the social behaviour of honey bees has often persuaded observers to draw comparisons with human sociability (cf. Maeterlinck 1901). In classical texts, as in more modern sources, the beehive is evoked in discussions of contemporary society for a variety of different purposes; for example, to support the argument that the pursuit of individual interests could nevertheless promote the well-being of the collective, as in de Mandeville's account (1970; cf. Winch 1996). In the Roman texts, however, there is an equally striking tendency to project contemporary concerns and assumptions back onto the bees. Not only philosophical discussions but also the more technical literature on beekeeping is influenced as much by the political context and the preoccupations of members of the Roman elite as it is by practical experience and the scientific tradition. The aim of this article is to explore the most important aspects of this influence, and its consequences for apicultural practice. 1. Rome as a beehive Bees were not the only creatures to be identified in ancient accounts as sociable, and their society to be regarded as analogous, at least in some respects, to human society. Aristotle included wasps, ants and cranes, as well as bees and humans, in the category of politika or social animals, carefully defined as 'those which have some one com mon activity' (HA 488a8-14); Pliny, with rather less caution, noted that ants also have a system of government (reipublicae ratio) and market-days (dies . . . nundinis) (NH 11.109-10). Other classical authors, however, focussed almost exclusively on the bee hive when considering the theme of sociability: Cicero stated that both bees and humans are gregarious (congregabilia) by nature, though humans possess this trait to a higher degree (Off. 1.157), while Varro noted that bees are not solitary by nature like eagles, but are like humans (RR 3.16.3; generally, Ransome 1937, 75-90). There was considerable room for debate as to whether the bees' sociability was fully comparable with human behaviour and whether it was founded upon reason or merely instinct. Aristotle argued that the human being was a ?a)ov teoAxtikov 'in a greater measure than any bee or other animal' because of its possession of speech and hence Historia, Band 56/4 (2007) ? Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart</page><page sequence="2">Civil War and Succession Crisis in Roman Beekeeping 463 its capacity for deliberation and moral choice (Ptf/.1253a.7-18; cf. Lloyd 1983, 24-5). Quintilian echoed this conclusion, suggesting that humans had ratio as a special gift to compensate for their physical deficiencies in comparison with other animals; pur poseful and organised animal activity like constructing nests, storing food and making honey and wax might indicate a certain level of reason, but without the capacity for speech its effectiveness would be limited (2.16.13ff). Similar arguments continue to be brought forward in modern philosophical discussions of the moral status of animals and anthropological accounts of human behaviour (cf. Clark 1977, 1997; Ingold 1983). The Platonic and Pythagorean traditions, on the other hand, tended to question the ab solute distinction between human and animal behaviour, and to ascribe some measure of rationality to at least some animals (Sorabji, 1993). Cicero emphasised that a natural, unreasoned instinct lay behind the gregarious behaviour of both bees and humans (Off. 1.157), while for Pliny the social complexity of the bees was a sign not only of their rationality but of their superiority to humans: 'what men, by the god of truth, can we compare with them in reason, who are unquestionably superior in this, that they make no changes (nihil novere) except for a common end?' (NH 11.12). The identification of social complexity in the beehive often shaded into simple identification and deliberate comparison; bees, like other animals, were 'good to think with' (Lloyd 1983, 10). Pliny employed the beehive to highlight human failings-the bees show that it is not inevitable that society should be dominated by faction and the self-interest of a few-much as Tacitus used descriptions of the lifestyles and customs of Germania to point out the deficiencies of contemporary Rome (cf. Rives 1999,51,60-1). More commonly, however, the hive was offered as a positive model of good government and proper kingship, as seen above all in Seneca's account in De dementia (Dahlmann 1970). The rationality or otherwise of the bees was here beside the point; what mattered was that they acted in accordance with, and therefore revealed, the underlying laws of nature. In the first place, the beehive legitimised the institution of monarchy: 'Nature herself conceived the idea of the king, as we may recognise from the case of bees and other creatures' (Sen. Clem. 1.19.2). Secondly, it demonstrated how true kingship would be rewarded, in the loyalty of the bees to their ruler: they attend him as he processes (procedii) through the hive accompanied by lictors, and carry him if he is tired (Pliny NHW.53-A), they follow him whenever he leaves the hive (Xen. Cyr. 5.1.24, Oik. 7.38; Sen. Clem. 1.19.2) and mourn him when he dies (Pliny NH 11.63). Aelian contrasted the willingness of the bees to track down their king and bring him back to the hive with the Athenians' expulsion of the tyrants, which was explained by the failure of the Pei sistratids to rule according to the laws or to exhibit the art of kingship (NA 5.10). Thirdly, the bees offered a template for the behaviour expected of the king, in order to conform to nature's law and elicit the same measure of loyalty from his subjects: they presented a model for the vital tasks of supervision, distribution and the encouragement of labour within society (Xen. Oik. 7.17, 7.33-4; Pliny NH 11.53), for government ac cording to the rule of law (Aelian remarked that the king bee legislates after the manner of great rulers 'to whom philosophers like to ascribe simultaneously the qualities of a citizen and a king' [NA 5.11]) and above all for the exercise of royal clemency. Writers disagreed as to whether the king bee actually possesses no sting, or has one but refuses to use it (e.g. Arist. HA 553b5-7; Pliny NH 11.52); as Aelian noted (NA 1.60), either situation would be a cause of astonishment, but in any case 'this is a great exemplar for great kings' (Sen. Clem. 1.19.3). Even as Seneca claimed that Nero was already fol lowing the path of the true rex and required no model like Augustus or Tiberius (Clem.</page><page sequence="3">464 Neville Morley 1.1.6), he put forward for imitation the paradigm of the king bee, whom Nature wished to be incapable of cruelty (Dahlmann 1970, 181-2; Roller 2001, 239-47). Virgil's account of the bees in the fourth book of the Georgics has sometimes been interpreted as a precursor of Seneca's apian theory of natural kingship. There are some obvious differences - unlike Seneca, Virgil focused on the courage and other martial qualities of the king bee rather than his dementia -but both emphasised the beauty and stature of the true king, and both presented kingship as the best hope for the future well-being of society. Virgil's bees, it is suggested, offer 'die politisch-philosophische Begriindung der gottgewollten und naturlichen Berechtigung des Principates' (Dahlmann 1970,196) or 'a complete paradigm for human society' (Thomas 1986,247). However, in contrast to Seneca's appeal to the existence of universal laws of nature, exemplified in the hive, Virgil did not offer an explicit rationale for learning from the bees; readers are simply left to be struck by the analogy with Roman society, and to draw their own conclusions. It is in the nature of such analogies that they can sometimes highlight the inferiority of reality, or indeed of humanity, to the ideal. 'The model fails precisely when it is needed and precisely because the allegory does not work for men. Instead, it recontextualises human problems and imagines human vulnerability without offering an apian solution' (Batstone 1997,140). Plato had earlier noted that, unlike in human society, the ruler of the bees is by birth pre-eminently fitted from the beginning in body and mind for his role (Pol. 30 le), a criticism that haunts later theories of natural kingship. Virgil went further in questioning the validity of the model, by presenting both the problems of the beehive and their solutions from the perspective of the smallholder with a hive in his garden. Unlike the civil wars of the Romans, the battles of the bees can be ended by the beekeeper with a handful of dust; there is no such benevolent higher power to intervene on Rome's behalf. The beekeeper can select the best king according to clear criteria; Rome's rulers, on the other hand, are not rationally selected for their fitness to rule, and one cannot rip the wings from Octavian to stop him swarming (Wilkinson 1969, 182). The society of the beehive in Virgil's account is thus less a realisable model and more an image of unattainable peace and simplicity, like the peasant small-holding before the agricultural revolution of the late Republic; if only human society could be managed like a beehive... Pliny's social critique, not Seneca's blueprint for monarchy, appears the more perceptive response to Virgil's reading of Rome as a beehive. 2. The beehive as Rome It could be argued that the implications of Virgil's account for Roman society were excessively pessimistic precisely because of his focus on the beehive in the domestic context and hence on the role of the beekeeper. Wild bees manage quite well on their own, without their hives inevitably collapsing into civil war or the line of 'kings' de generating; the interventions of the beekeeper in the domestic hive are primarily for his own benefit and convenience, not the bees' welfare. Virgil's choice of perspective, unconsciously or consciously, led him to emphasise the need for the management of an otherwise vulnerable and unstable society, and thus to highlight the absence of a benevolent higher power that could intervene to solve Rome's problems. Pliny, in con trast, focusing above all on the internal life of the hive, was struck by the bees' ability to manage themselves and promote the common good (NH 11.11-12). This raises a wider</page><page sequence="4">Civil War and Succession Crisis in Roman Beekeeping 465 question about the place of the bee in the Roman imagination, and what this might tell us about the Romans' conceptions of and relationships with the natural world. Modern studies of bees in antiquity have tended to focus on reconstructing the material facts of Roman beekeeping practices (e.g. Fraser 1951, Crane 1983), on compiling accounts of mythological beliefs or on considering the way that the example of the bees shaped discussions of Roman politics. However, the corollary of the latter discourse was the way that the beehive was viewed as a microcosm of Rome and its behaviour interpreted in terms of contemporary political preoccupations, and that in turn influenced the prac tices of Roman apiculture. Ancient views of nature, like other areas of ancient science, were marked by the interplay between popular assumptions, inherited tradition and critical evaluation (cf. Lloyd 1983,1). In the case of the bees, two examples stand out. The first is the way that the majority of commentators, until the eighteenth century, saw the bees' ruler as male (Xenophon seems to be a partial exception, using the phrase 'the bee leader' [hegemon] in the feminine: Oik. 7.17; Fraser 1951,16-17,21-2; Davies &amp; Kathirithamby 1986,63; Pomeroy 1994,278-9). Aristotle had offered a ostensibly reasoned argument to support this position, on the basis of a generalisation from larger animals that female creatures do not carry defensive weapons (Lloyd 1983, 99, 102); most writers simply took it for granted that rulers must be male (cf. Cartledge 1993, 82-6). The development by the Romans of a potentially workable 'observation hive' using a sheet of translucent lantern horn (Pliny NH 11.49, 21.80; Whitfield 1956), which might have permitted observa tion of the 'king' laying eggs if anyone had been inclined to investigate, did not lead to any such discovery. As Lloyd has argued, all observations are theory-laden, and the questions asked by observers are heavily conditioned by the social, cultural, and intel lectual context (1979, 128-9). It is more difficult to imagine the conditions that could have inspired a systematic enquiry in antiquity into the possibility of the existence of female rulers in nature than it is to see how the belief could persist that female rulers were by definition inconceivable. More puzzling is the persistence of the belief (attested seriously as late as 1842) in bugonia, the idea that a new swarm of bees could be obtained by burying a dead ox (Virgil G. 4.538-58; Ovid Fast. 1.376-80; cf. Ransome 1937, 112-18, 153-4; Fraser 1951, 8-12). In his discussion of the generation of bees, Aristotle developed a general distinction between arguments (logoi), 'data' (phainomena) and observation (aisthesis), and noted that in this case the facts had not been sufficiently ascertained, without mak ing any mention of bugonia (GA 759-60). Later writers, however, simply retold the myth without subjecting it to any rational enquiry, at best distancing themselves from it by ascribing it to tradition or to Virgil (cf. Pliny NH 11.70; Servius, Schol. ad Aen. i.436). In Varro, the story is mentioned in passing by several characters-'bees are born partly from bees and partly from the putrefied body of a bullock' (RR 3.16.4); 'is the profit sweeter from oxen, which give birth to bees, than from bees?' (3.2.11)-but the practical advice to the aspiring beekeeper focuses on obtaining swarms through purchase (3.16.19-21). Columella avoided the subject of bugonia altogether, on the grounds that 'hidden secrets of nature' are more agreeable to students of literature than to busy farm ers; he focussed instead on practical advice, such as how to find and collect swarms in the wild and how best to take advantage of one's own bees swarming (9.2.5). We may surmise that such practical methods worked often enough that bugonia was rarely if ever tried in practice; as with other 'magical' procedures, failure on one of those rare</page><page sequence="5">466 Neville Morley occasions would not necessarily have undermined belief in the general efficacy of the practice (cf. Lloyd 1979, 7). What is striking in Roman accounts of bees is the way that they were influenced not only by mythology, literary tradition, and the authority of Aristotle but by contemporary political preoccupations. The sources tend to interpret all bee behaviour not only in hu man terms but in specifically Roman terms, and to assume the existence of the whole range of Roman institutions within the hive. Varro noted that the bees have a rex and imperium as well as societas (RR 3.16.6), while Virgil cited their magnanimous leaders, their mores, their activities, their battles and their possession of apatria andpenates (G. 4.3-5, 153-5). Pliny claimed that bees endure toil, construct opera, have a res publica, private consilia and leaders, and hold funerals and perform rituals (NH 11.11-12, 63, 68). This tradition continued into the second century: 'Bees have a leader, with a train of courtiers and servants, and wars and conquests and the slaughter of the vanquished, and cities and suburbs, and they pass work on from one to another, and condemn the idle and vicious' (Celsus, quoted in Origen, c. Cels. iv.81). Roman sources show a particular fondness for portraying the society of the bees as a military camp-in other words, interpreting it in terms of one of the distinctive identi ties of Roman society. 'They all live as if in an army, sleeping and working regularly in turn, and send out as it were colonies, and their leaders (duces) give certain orders with the voice, as it were in imitation of the trumpet' (Varro, RR 3.16.9). When the bees are about to swarm, 'they make a loud humming sound exactly as soldiers do when they are breaking camp' (RR 3.16.30). Virgil emphasised the guards at the gate, the presence of standards in the camp and the warlike sounds when the bees come forth to battle (G. 4.165, 108, 67-72), and placed the king bee in a praetorium, a general's tent, where other sources tended to imagine the presence of a palace in the middle of the hive (G. 4.75; cf. Sen. Clem. 1.19.2). In Pliny's account, the bees head out in expeditione, and if night falls they bivouac (excubant); they send out scouts (speculatores), they keep guards at the gates more castrorum, they are woken at dawn by the call of one bee ut bucino, and are given the signal to go to sleep castrorum more (NH 11.19-20,26). Pliny even suggested that the unproductive drones are the offspring of 'veterans' (emeriti) who have completed their tour of duty (NH 11.27). Columella noted the uproar, 'like that of an army setting out on the march', before the bees swarm, and quoted Virgil on their martial roar and the voice that imitates the sound of trumpets (9.9.4). While Aris totle had recorded the phenomenon of the 'monotonous and peculiar hum' made by the bees when they were about to swarm, he made no attempt to interpret it as a military signal (HA 625b9; cf. 627a25); that is a distinctively Roman perspective. Authors like Varro and Columella are not attempting to construct an analogy between Rome and the beehive in order to derive moral lessons; they simply interpret the bees' behaviour in terms of their own social context. However, there was no unanimity in interpretations of Roman society or its problems. The most striking example of the ascendancy of cultural preconceptions and preoccu pations over observation or received knowledge, and of the variety of interpretations of bee behaviour that this then produced, is the Roman obsession with civil war and succession problems within the hive. Aristotle had claimed (erroneously) that it was necessary for the hive to have several rulers, but not too many (HA 553b 15); many Roman writers, however, interpreted the phenomenon of swarming as the result of the hive containing more than one 'king' and the bees' unwillingness to accept shared rule (Col. 9.9.1). Varro advised his readers to avoid having several chiefs in the hive, as this</page><page sequence="6">Civil War and Succession Crisis in Roman Beekeeping 467 leads to dissension; he claimed (misquoting Aristotle) that there are three types of king bee, and suggested that the black one should be killed, because otherwise he drives out the other king or is driven out and takes a swarm with him (RR 3.16.18). It is fairly easy to suggest a rationalising explanation for this belief; it had been known at least since Aristotle (HA 625b7-18) that each departing swarm contained a 'king' but that the hive was nevertheless not left without a ruler, and so it might be natural to assume that there had been more than one 'king' there to start with. The further inference, that swarming must be the result of having more than one 'king', betrays the influence of the experiences of Roman politics in the first century BCE. The most striking element of Virgil's account of the bees is the depiction of the fierce struggle between the armies of the rival kings in their civil war. Varro, however, had made no mention of bee battles; in his work the hive succession seems to be a purely internal affair unless the beekeeper intervenes. Here again he followed Aristotle, who described bees fighting, but only in the vicinity of the hive and only in order to defend it against robbers, whether wasps or other bees (HA 626al5-18; cf. Hooper 1997,184-5). From a modern perspective, 'robbing' seems the most plausible explanation of what Virgil must have observed and misinterpreted as an open-air battle (Royds 1914, 66-7; cf. Fraser 1951: 36-7). For an understanding of the Roman view of nature, however, what is significant is the form that this misinterpretation took. Virgil saw in the activi ties of the hive not just a complex society but a state suffering from similar problems to the Roman Republic; he conflated the different phenomena of robbing and swarming, clearly differentiated in earlier sources, assuming that all kinds of disturbance within the hive must be the result of civil war. The bee state is, like Rome, seen to be permanently vulnerable to dissension and self-destruction unless kept under close control. In the following century, Pliny and Columella offered quite different responses to Virgil's now-authoritative account. Pliny depicted the battles of bees as resulting from raids on their neighbours in times of food shortage or from chance encounters between bees from different hives while out foraging; the bees will then form lines of battle and summon their friends (NH 11.58). Whereas Virgil's beekeeper intervened in the civil struggle like a deus ex machina to quell the conflict and select a king, Pliny presented him almost as the third party observing a dispute between two neighbouring nations; whichever hive believes that he favours them, Pliny suggested, their bees will not at tack him. The account of the royal succession is also strikingly different: several rulers begin to be produced, he stated, but then the workers by unanimous vote (concorde suffragio) kill the worst of them so as not to divide their forces (NH 11.51). None of this is a wholly accurate description of the behaviour of the common honeybee, Apis mellifera (amongst whom the first new queen to hatch out generally seeks to kill the others); as in Virgil's account, cultural preconceptions are determining the interpreta tion of natural phenomena. Here, however, a very different image of Rome is being projected onto the beehive. In the passage quoted earlier, Pliny claimed that the bees 'make no changes except for a common end', nihil novere nisi commune (NH 11.12); the political connotations of novere are revolutionary, to overthrow the government or change the constitution. The beehive for Pliny reflects an ideal Rome, the sort of state that the Flavians might claim to have restored; a well-regulated, almost 'constitutional', monarchy, in which civil war is unknown and the succession is smoothly managed by the people acted in unison. Columella, writing around the same time as Pliny, reproduced much of Virgil's perspective and quoted him extensively (as elsewhere in his work; cf. Gowers 2000</page><page sequence="7">468 Neville Morley and Henderson 2002), but with some significant variations and developments. The bees, he stated, 'wage a kind of civil war amongst themselves and as it were foreign wars with other swarms' (9.9.5). Several remedies are offered for calming such quarrels and for reconciling kings at variance with one another, 'for there are often several leaders (duces) of one people, and the plebs is as it were divided into factions by the quarrels of its chiefs'(9.9.6). This must be prevented from happening often, since whole gentes are destroyed by internal strife (intestino bello). And so, if good feeling exists between the principes, peace continues and no blood is shed. If, however, you have often noticed them fighting a pitched battle, you will take care to put to death the leaders of the fac tions. (9.9.6-7) One might speculate how far Columella's ideas on the relationships between rival principes-including his return to the Aristotelian belief that it was possible for them to co-exist harmoniously-were influenced by actual post-Augustan developments; likewise his thoughts on the problem of the royal succession. He noted that the beekeeper should not (as some other writers have advised) put an old king to death, 'for the crowd of older bees, who form a kind of senate, do not think fit to obey the juniors and, through obstinately despising the orders of those who are stronger than themselves, are visited with punishment and death' (9.11.2). However, if the king of the old bees instead dies from old age, too much licence in the hive gives rise to discord, just as when the head of a family dies; the beekeeper must intervene by taking a suitable leader from another hive which has several chiefs and setting him up as ruler (9.11.3). This advice appears to express an anxiety about the ever-present danger of conflict between generations (and the precarious position of members of the Senate under the Principate), not to mention the apparent impossibility of managing the succession from one ruler to another with out at least some measure of crisis. It offers a striking contrast with Pliny's version; the comparison suggests either a new manifestation of the literary rivalry between the two authors (cf. Beagon 1992: 174 n.27), or, in so far as it reveals markedly different political perspectives, a possible explanation of that rivalry. 3. Managing the bee state These different conceptions of the politics of the hive had clear implications for practi cal beekeeping. Pliny's rational, self-governing bees could be left largely to their own devices, with the interventions of the beekeeper confined to taking honey and to removing the body of a king who has died from pestilence, in order that the mass of bees should not remain sunk in mourning and hence starve to death (AW 11.63). In Virgil's account, on the other hand, the society of the hive is assumed to be inherently fragile and un stable, and so the beekeeper must intervene regularly and aggressively to restore order and protect the bees from themselves. Depending on which authority was consulted by a beekeeper, the phenomenon of swarming might be seen as a calamitous outbreak of civil strife, requiring a drastic remedy, or, following Columella, simply as an opportu nity to increase the number of hives in the apiary. Modern beekeeping practice inclines more to the latter perspective, but the prominence of the theme of internal conflict and violence in every account but Pliny's suggests that the Romans were in general more inclined to project their problems than their ideals onto nature.</page><page sequence="8">Civil War and Succession Crisis in Roman Beekeeping 469 In other respects, too, Roman beekeeping practice may have been influenced by Roman anthropomorphism. The agronomists tended to objectify all living creatures on the villa estate, including the slaves; for example, Varro discussed mules, dogs and herdsmen in exactly the same terms, assessing them all in terms of physical qualities and temperament (RR 2.1.25, 2.10.3). Bees, however, are treated with respect and their emotions taken into consideration, especially as regards the extraction of honey. Varro expressed concern that the bees may lose heart if all the honey is taken or if their new hive is too large and empty (RR 3.16.15, 3.16.34); Columella advised that none of the honey gathered after late September should be touched, 'lest the bees, disheartened by continual ill-treatment and as if in desperation, should take to flight' (9.14.11). Whereas other animals must be driven and disciplined, bees should be cared for and encouraged, rather than compelled, to work harder (e.g. Varro, RR 3.16.12-13, 21, 28, 34, 37; Col. 9.14.13-17, 9.15.3). Pliny, predictably, went further, emphasising the importance of aequitas in the relationship between bees and beekeepers, and noting that if this societas is defrauded the hives will perish (NH 11.44). This advice offers a final contrast with Virgil's account. He considered the possibility of exercising leniency in the extraction of honey- 'if you fear the harshness of winter, anxious to protect their future, pitying their bruised spirits and bankrupt estate' (G. 4.239-40)-but concluded that 'the more exhausted they are, the keener they will be to mend the ruin of their fallen race, to restock the storerooms and build the warehouses for the flowers' (G. 4.248-50). His beekeeper now appears less as the benevolent deity of the bees, intervening to stop their civil war and ensure the purity of their ruling line, than as the archetype of the rapacious imperial conqueror, maintaining peace in order to despoil the country more effectively. The fact that Italy had managed to recover from the devastation of the civil wars-and that certain individuals had flourished under the new regime-is perhaps the inspiration for advice that, according to every modern handbook of beekeeping, would most likely have proved disastrous for the hive.
