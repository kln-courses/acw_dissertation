<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wakefield's Scheme of Systematic Colonization and Classical Economics By EDWARD R. KITTRELL* I INTRODUCTION THE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE that Edward Gibbon Wakefield's scheme of Systematic Colonization had on the course of British colonial policy to- wards Australia still evokes significant controversy (1). Perhaps the reader will find equally interesting a discussion of the specific nature of Wakefield's influence on English economic thought as it came to grapple with the problems of colonization. This too has evoked scholarly contro- versy, and the writer has presented his views elsewhere. This paper will be an embellishment of that position; namely, that Wakefield's influence on the classical economists was primarily in policy orientation (though in a very specific direction) and less on substantive matters of theory, and most especially that his critique of the self-equilibrating economic mecha- nism is not in the least germane to either an understanding of this policy or his influence on classical economics (2). Indeed the economists of the classical period were more interested in Wakefield's technique of coloniza- tion. This technique was embodied in Wakefield's arguments for the sale of the colonial lands at an artificial price sufficiently restrictive as to pre- clude an uneconomical and fatal dispersion of settlers in the land-abundant colonies. In modern jargon, this means the creation of those external economies of production that permeate throughout the economy subse- quent to a deepening of the division of labor and, by becoming cumula- tive, lay the foundations for successful economic development. This critique by Wakefield of the market-allocative mechanism was more sys- tematic and engaging than his theoretically indeterminate macro-analytical assaults on classical theory. Rightfully this microcritique elicited pro- longed response from the writers concerned with the colonization issue. The response itself is of great interest because certain aspects of the quality of the micro-analytical technique in the classical period were made ex- plicit. The study of this debate indicates the definite circumscribed con- tent of Wakefield's influence on the policy toward colonization adopted by "Wakefieldians" and the even more limited inroads he made on the economic theory of the period. Thus, the theme of this paper is that Wakefield's overall influence was of a very limited, albeit important nature. Indeed, from the study of</page><page sequence="2">88 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology Wakefield's exchange with his "followers," one is impressed by the fact that to be classified as a Wakefieldian placed the respective writer in a motley group where the substantive content of the economic theory of each disciple could differ markedly from each of the others (3). Never- theless, amidst this heterogeneity there was a common factor that really delineates the Wakefieldian influences. To show the content of classical period micro-analysis as well as the cause of this unifying principle this article will proceed by first considering the essentials of Wakefield's tech- nique of colonization that formed the core of his program. This will be followed by sections concerned with the response of the economists to this technique; the basis for Wakefield's influence on the classical economists; and concluding remarks. II THE SUFFICIENT PRICE DOCTRINE PRIOR TO WAKEFIELD, Adam Smith provided the frame of reference for considering the conditions conducive to economic progress within a colony. According to him, the emigrants carry with them to the colonies superior knowledge of agriculture and of the useful arts, and the cultural attributes favorable to stable government. When this is combined with the colonial land that is cheap and plentiful, where there are no rents and taxes are nil, accumulation will progress rapidly. Wages are bid up, population in- creases, and "what encourages the progress of population and improvement encourages that of real wealth and greatness" (4). At this point one might ask how an effective division of labor is to be established on this cheap colonial land. It appears that at first Smith is going to lead into the type of thought that decades later distinguished Wakefield from his prede- cessors. Smith writes that among savage and barbarous nations every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate. He has no rent, and scarce any taxes to pay. ... He has every motive to render as great as possible a produce, which is thus to be entirely his own. But his land is commonly so extensive, that with all his own industry, and with all the industry of other people whom he can get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of what it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect labourers from all quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal wages. But these liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheapness of land, soon make these labourers leave him.... Now Wakefield agreed with the diagnosis thus far. But in the conclud- ing sentences, Wakefield (as we shall see) believed that Smith gave the wrong directions for subsequent economic thought on this question. For Smith argued that the higher wages resulting from the great productivity</page><page sequence="3">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics of the cheap and plentiful land encourages population, and since the divi- sion of labor is limited by the extent of the market, productivity rises indefinitely as the population and market expands (5). And when one peruses the later pre-Wakefield classical literature on this question the im- pression is given that, somehow, an effective division of labor will be established on this cheap and fertile colonial land. Thus McCulloch wrote that it is highly probable, that if emigration were conducted on a large scale, the facilities of obtaining labourers would be so great that capitalists would be induced to undertake extensive settlements; and that a small premium from Government would be sufficient to make them responsible to the support of large bodies of emigrants (6). As we shall see, Wakefield forced a more rigorous formulation of this market process in the colonies. Here it is important to note that to Wake- field, however, this abundance of cheap land in the colonies would only doom each colony to failure unless quite unorthodox polices respecting the disposal of colonial lands were put into effect by the government. The government must take positive action to lay the foundations for the creation of those external economies associated with a better division of labor in the colony. Wakefield, claiming that political economists had overlooked the fact that economic circumstances in new countries differ from those in Europe, concluded that one must realize "the paramount and universal influence on the progress and prosperity of a colony, of the mode in which the government may dispose of waste land" (7). He recommended the sale of colonial lands by the government to the colonization societies which would resell the lands to the colonists. In itself, land sales were not a Wakefieldian innovation. Torrens, among others, had advocated land sales prior to Wakefield. However, Wakefield's contribution lay in the argument that a price as such was not sufficient to assure the success of the colony. Rather, the price had to be a price that was restrictive-one that forced concentration on the land and precluded dispersion throughout the colony. It was to be a price sufficiently high to keep the colonist a laborer for such time it took to assure an effective division of labor. This tighten- ing in the division of labor enhanced productivity, profits and wages rose, capital and labor were attracted to the colonies, and the growth of the colony was assured. This was the economics of the sufficient price. It was the price that occasioned, in Wakefield's words neither superabundance of people nor superabundance of land, but so limiting the quantity of land, as to give the cheapest land a market value that would have the effect of compelling the labourers to work some con- siderable time for wages before they could become landowners. A price 89</page><page sequence="4">90 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology that did less than this, would be insufficient; one that did more, would be excessive; the price that would do this and no more, is the proper price. I am used to call it the sufficient price (8). Cheap lands and the subsequent large grants of lands to individuals thus were considered the root cause of past colonial failure. Indeed the large land to labor ratio in the new world was even invaluable in explaining the rise of slavery there. Wakefield's metaphor of the elastic belt is a succinct statement of his principle: In order to create and maintain a very high rate of wages in the colony, it is necessary, first, that the colonists should have an ample field of produc- tion; ample, that is, in proportion to capital and labour; such an extent of land as to render unnecessary the cultivation of inferior soils, and to permit a large proportion of the people to be engaged in agriculture; a field, large from the beginning, and continually enlarged with the increase of capital and people. But, in the second place, it is quite as necessary that the field of production should never be too large; should never be so large as to encourage hurtful dispersion; as to promote that cutting up of capital and labour into small fractions, which, in the greater number of modern col- onies, has led to poverty and barbarism, or speedy ruin. For securing the first condition of high profits and wages, the power of the government over waste land must be exerted actively, in bestowing upon individuals title to the possession of land; for the second object, that power must be exerted negatively, in refusing titles to waste land. The actions of the two exertions of power together, may be compared to that of an elastic belt, which, though always tight, will always yield to pressure within (9). Although this sufficient price was the fundamental consideration in his recommendations for colonization, he advocated also that the use of the proceeds from the sales of the colonial lands at this price be used to defray the burdensome expenses of the colonization. Initially he seemed to think that the interaction between the land sales and the concomitant provisions for establishment of an emigration fund equated the colonial demand for labor with the supply of labor so as to establish a "self-supporting system of colonization." Later he repudiated this as "a sort of puff," much to the regret of some of his followers (10). The importance of this emigration fund in the minds of Wakefield's contemporaries is the subject of further comment. III THE CRITIQUE OF THE SUFFICIENT PRICE THERE WERE MANY CRITICISMS of varying importance of this basis of Wakefield's system. One of the most frequent was that the price on colo-</page><page sequence="5">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics nial lands would divert settlement to less costly lands, especially to the United States (11). Wakefield at first felt that his plan was not applicable to Canada for this reason, though he later withdrew this reservation. Some critics felt that the price was practically impossible to determine (12). Wakefield was cognizant of the political effects of such criticism. When he first organized his thoughts on this matter, he set the price at ?2 per acre. When these ideas were placed in an appendix to A Letter from Sydney, however, he left the price space blank. Later, he returned to his originally stated price. His most usual answer to this criticism, however, was that the sufficient price could be determined only by experience, and consequently it would vary from colony to colony at any given time. In practice, Wakefield felt that the best approach was for the govern- ment to fix a relatively low price, and as experience dictated, gradually to raise the price until the rates of wages and profits indicated that the price was sufficient. He also felt that since the length of service a worker would give in the colony was dependent upon the wages rate, cost of living, fer- tility of soils, and the type of climate existing in the particular colony, these data could be used to establish the sufficient price (13). Even here Wakefield faced criticism, led by Torrens, of all people. In- dicating the rough sledding Wakefield was getting at the hands of his "followers," Torrens noted the theory was only applicable in colonies where emigration could be increased in geometrical ratio. Let Mr. Wakefield's rule be brought into practical operation [Torrens writes], and let the price of land and the amount of wages be so adjusted that emigrants of the labouring class, by working as hired labourers for three years accumulate sufficient capital to become masters or cultivators on their own account; [then, Torrens concludes] it will become necessary, in order to keep the rule in operation that the emigration of labourers should increase in a geometrical ratio-the period of doubling being three years (14). The penetrating Herman Merivale, destined for greatness in the Colonial Office, saw that under these conditions wages would be bid up, thereby upsetting the calculations for the sufficient price (15). One modern student, in the most extensive account of the Wakefield theory and program, points out that private resale of the land, voluntary emigration, and the holding of land for speculative purposes upset the calculations for a sufficient price. Moreover, the price that would insure the "proper" adjustment of labor and capital to the land would not neces- sarily be the price that would insure the right volume of emigration since this would vary with the cost of the emigrant's passage. The conclusion was that the doctrine of the sufficient price is incorrect, leaving a series of 91</page><page sequence="6">92 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology important practical rules for colonization, and even then these apply only in the early stages of the colony's history (16). In truth, there were no such "rules" bequeathed. Rather a salient policy of meeting the expenses of emigration evolved. Moreover, a more fundamental criticism of Wake- field emanated from theorists in the Colonial Office. This will be dis- cussed following a few prefatory but necessary remarks. The crucial external economy argument of the Wakefieldians that was used in criticism of past colonial policies on land disposition was that the land prices confronting individuals do not reflect the alternatives to society. There are two replies: 1) the external economies are small; or 2) with a monopoly of the trade in a new colony, these economies are mostly internal economies. Effective criticism centered on the magnitude of the alleged external economies. In the ensuing discussions a positive price on land per se was not criticized generally by the skeptics. Their doubts concen- trated on the alleged need for forced concentration on the land and the inefficiencies from using the abundant factor of production sparsely. It was a question of evidence, and both sides in the dispute attempted a syste- matic presentation of the historical process of land settlement to evaluate the issue in question. Wakefield always argued there would be large net external economies from his policy. The opposition, primarily his "fol- lowers," disagreed. One of the reasons for the study of the history of economic thought is to ask the same questions as did our predecessors and then compare their answers with those derived from using our (presumably) superior an- alytical techniques (17). Students of this question know that the type of argument presented by Wakefield has continued to evoke controversy (18). What is surprising is that Wakefield met criticism in a vein that has a very modern flavor, based as it was on opportunity cost analysis. The aged Bentham, the young J. S. Mill (with a serious qualification), and in the beginning, the prolific Torrens, all accepted the sufficient price principle; whereas, James Mill, McCulloch, and Malthus remained hostile. James Mill maintained that the colonists' self-interest would discover that "the advantages of concentration are so obvious, that contiguous land would always be cultivated, when the inferiority of the soil was not more than a counterbalance." McCulloch, too, pleaded the self-interest argument in addition to claiming that the price on land would divert the stream of emigration from the colonies. Later he was more sympathetic because of the provision in the plan for the emigration fund. He even agreed that past policies of huge land grants in the colonies were detrimental and asked that a moderate price should be placed on the colonial lands. But</page><page sequence="7">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics he warned that "the degree of concentration they [i.e., Wakefieldians] recommended would be ten times more injurious" than the late system of granting lands in the colonies. Malthus, besides being skeptical of plans for securing an "artificial concentration" of colonists in the colonies, did not feel that the land sales would provide sufficient funds for financing the emigration (19). However, the incisive criticism was to come from a group of relatively unknown political economists who held influential positions in the civil service. In modern analysis, the discussion of the sufficient price would com- mence with the theory of production where the interaction of technological and economic (cost-price) factors with certain behavioral assumptions results in such an input mix as to minimize costs. Concomitantly, output is optimal given the technical-economic constraint: for output and input mixes different from the minimum cost position, a more profitable revenue will be achieved by adjusting the input mix and/or the output in the direc- tion of the least cost output position. Equilibrium-wise, equal product is obtained for alternative inputs for each unit of expenditure; which is to say that the value of the marginal product of each productive input equals its alternative costs. In the adjustment process, of course, this entails the greater use of the relatively abundant factor of production as compared to the relatively scarce factor since the opportunity costs of the former are lower. Now by allowing for a liberal interpretation of their texts, one may see that some of Wakefield's critics grappled with this problem with such a frame of reference in mind (20). This critique shall be studied shortly. Of importance now is to note that Wakefield to the contrary was asking that the abundant factor (land) be made relatively scarce through the instrument of the restrictive sufficient price. And as his critics noted, Wakefield conceived of some optimum combination of the factors in the colonies that rested on technological instead of economic considerations. Thus Wakefieldians could write that "the sole object of the price [is] to secure the most desirable proportion between people and land . . . ;" so that if labour were too plentiful, he would know that the price of new land was too high; that is, more than sufficient; if it were hurtfully scarce, he would know that the price was too low, or not sufficient.... If the lawgiver saw that the labour was scarce and the price [of land] too low, he would raise the price; if he saw that labour was superabundant and the price [of land] too high, he would lower the price. [And again:] Should the capital and labour first planted in the colony be in the best proportion, in this propor- tion they will naturally remain (21). The ensuing criticism of this position was devastating. James Spedding, 93</page><page sequence="8">94 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology a "follower" of Wakefield in the Colonial Office, found in colonization a means of alleviating Britain's population problem. However, in a review that often praised Wakefield, Spedding critically touched certain aspects of the former's program in a manner which was to undermine the very basis of Wakefield's system. Commenting on Wakefield's approach, Spedding says assume that the rate of wages was such as could not be reduced without introducing the evils incident to an unpeopled country, then we might ascertain how many labourers could be imported without reducing wages-and this might be regarded as the mean between dispersion and density, a greater number would be injurious to the general interests of society. But it appears to us that, so long as land is dear, an increase in the number of candidates for employment could cause a reduction of wages, and thereby enable the land- holder either to employ a greater number of hands, and so increase his produce; or the same number at a less cost, and so increase his profits;- and, on the other hand, that so long as wages are high enough to enable an industrious man to save his ?20 a year, the effect of a reduction would be to keep him longer in the condition of a labourer but not to contract the comforts attached to that condition. Spedding then claims that, in effect, Wakefield is confusing techno- logical with economic solutions. He concludes: How will you know when you have got your sufficient price? Tell us what proportion of labourers can cultivate the land well, and we will tell you of a proportion which will cultivate it better. Name any price which will secure a larger produce and we will name one which will secure a larger. So long as a larger amount of human skill and industry can be had for the same cost, and can be applied to quicken the productive powers of nature, it seems vain to suppose that you have attained the maximum of produce; and as long as the produce can be increased without increasing in proportion the non-productive consumers of produce, you have not reached the highest point of prosperity which the land will bear (22). Thus, Spedding felt that market forces would prevent the uneconomic dispersion. He asked only for a minimum price on the land so high "as to interrupt any fatal tendency to dispersion." The method of assuring the proper combination of the factors of production in the colony was "the competition of rival settlements." The facility of settling on unoccupied lands would immediately correct any mistakes that would befall an un- peopled country, "while the price offered for lands sold by auction would supply a test of their actual value which might be useful in adjusting the . price" of land (23). In his Oxford lectures, Merivale cited this argument of Spedding's. He added that if the number of immigrants increased, wages would fall, and</page><page sequence="9">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics the decline in wages would be the greater the larger the number of im- migrants relative to the acres under cultivation. Thus the capitalist might find it profitable to pay a higher price for land if the supply of labor was subsequently increased. Merivale concluded sardonically that the sufficient price reduces to this: ?. . The sufficient price of waste land, if it is to be estimated by the quantity of labour required, will be the highest price which any body thinks it worth while to give up (24). Moreover he maintained that for colonies producing primarily for the domestic market it would be uneconomical to force the use of the abundant factor (fertile land) as if it were scarce. Because of this he pleaded for the small-scale farm, maintaining fertile soil is, to the settler, the machine with which he works; it is that for the sake of which he is content to forego all the benefits he might have derived from remaining a member of an older and denser community. To prevent his occupation of the most fertile soil within reach, either by raising its price, or by any conventional arrangement, is to force him to resort to the use of a less productive machine; it is to force him to waste a portion of his precious labour, to forego a part of his expected reward, with a view to certain speculative advantages for the community (25). Thus in colonies of this type there would be no net external economies from the restrictive price. He concluded that the proposal of the Coloni- zation Society to restrict the use of cheap land in this type of colony through a high price had been exploded by McCulloch as proceeding on the assumption that the individual is not the best judge of his own interest (26). After such an auspicious beginning, nonetheless, Merivale came close to throwing out the baby with the bathwater. For in the class of colonies that raised staple articles for the European market, the Wakefield diagnosis and prescription seemingly was accepted by Merivale (27). He even quotes a commentator on the asocial behavior of the American farmers, who when told 'of the necessity of manuring with a view to preserve the fertility of the soil, . . . almost uniformly tell you, that the expense of labour renders it far more expedient for them, as soon as their repeated cropping very much diminishes the quantity of grain, to lay down in the grass, or make a pur- chase of new land in the neighborhood, or even to sell their cleared land and proceed in quest of a new settlement, than to adopt a system of rotation of crops assisted by manure.' This resulted in "a constant tendency of the population toward a barbarism by their dispersion" (28). 95</page><page sequence="10">96 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology However, even here Merivale's innate skepticism becomes apparent. He noted that even colonies that produced for export had flourished for a time with dispersion and without compulsory labor. He cited the West Indies and the Southern Colonies where prosperity abounded because of un- exhausted land in the proximity of ports, navigable rivers, or other facili- ties of transport (29). He denied also the applicability of Wakefield's principle to North America and New Zealand. Australia seemed to afford the best example substantiating Wakefield's analysis and program. But he added that "the success of the system of high price in Australia has been attained under peculiar natural conditions" (30). The more he lectured on Wakefield the greater his misgivings. Merivale was aware that geographical factors such as islands, forests, and mountain ranges will prohibit uneconomical dispersion. In the absence of such obstacles to dispersion he adds that "the inclination of men for the ease and independence of pastoral, semi-savage life, a propensity which seems to overcome that of self-interest, even in the most enterprising and indus- trious of races, undoubtedly places great obstacles in the way of civiliza- tion." But his concluding remarks in this instance could hardly have endeared him to the Wakefieldians. Merivale writes: ... it is undoubtedly difficult to conceive, that any government regulations, least of all those of a government established at the distance of half the earth's circumference, can effectually control their future career (31). Five lectures later he now denies that dispersion in the colonies has been harmful. The much publicized disaster of the Swan River colony is an isolated episode: "generally speaking, the body of settlers will not disperse beyond the limits of tolerably easy communication with each other; and none, or a few hermits only, will go beyond the reach of markets...." And though the arguments for the forced concentration of the colonists instead of permitting the colony to follow its natural course "may be true; .. .yet, on the other hand, the economical loss which the colony inevitably sustains by not being left to follow its natural course-by being forced to concentrate itself on the less natural soils-will probably overbalance all these real or imaginary advantages" (32). As if this were not enough, Merivale further claims that the adverse effects accompanying the large free grants of lands in the colonies have been exaggerated. The differences between the social and private interest created by such a policy is only a short-run dichotomy bcause "the persons who have acquired large grants, which they have been unable to cultivate, sooner or later find it in their interest to make them over in smaller portions to others who will...." (33).</page><page sequence="11">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics All these severe qualifications and strictures must be fixed in the mind of the reader when he finds Merivale pleading for a due consideration for the concentration of labor on the colonial land throughout his discursive lectures (34). John Crawfurd, another colonial administrator, was mod- ern and more direct in his evaluation of Wakefield's plan: But by what madness is it, that the colonist has a propensity to cultivate the larger surface slovenly in preference to the smaller a'la Chinoise, if it is not that he obtains more from it? For their own good, the colonists are to be dragooned into a refined husbandry, and in contempt of an old and and heretofore admitted maxim of economical wisdom, individuals are not to be permitted to pursue their interests in their own way, but the Govern- ment is to prescribe to them what is most for their advantage. The occu- pants of a new territory think only of the processes which from experience have been found most profitable. Where land is abundant, they find that a great deal of land gives a larger return for the same amount of labour or expenditure of capital when slightly cultivated, than a small surface more carefully tilled. It would be absurdity and folly to pursue any other course than that which they follow. When the land becomes scarce, a more careful husbandry commences, and capital having increased [and] the price of labour fallen, the proprietor is enabled to introduce improved processes with advantage (35). Curiously this type of criticism escaped the notice of some of the better minds of the day. Perhaps this simply reflects the prevalent strength of the classical Ricardian economic theory. For the classicists usually regarded the proportions in which all the various grades and qualities of the pro- ductive factors may be combined as fixed, as impervious to relative factor prices and scale of production. Mill did cite the argument "that when things are left to themselves, land is appropriated and occupied by the spontaneous choice of individuals, in the quantities and at the times most advantageous to each person, and therefore to the community generally"- but only in order to counter that Wakefield's principle corrected this notion. In fact, Mill claimed that Wakefield's principle itself illustrated the maxim for governmental interference that was due to the difficulties created when one individual had no inclination to practice forbearance (in this case, apropos acquisition of cheap land) unless he is assured that others will do so (36). When Cairnes criticized the Wakefield program (in corre- spondence with Mill), Cairnes gave a more casual formulation, and only touched obliquely the Colonial Office train of thought. Cairnes simply felt that if the colony were made attractive, the growing density of pop- ulation would surmount (alleged) Wakefieldian fears. He claimed that with reference to the Wakefield system . . . the forcible separation of em- ployments was unnecessary, and for this reason, that where the density of 97</page><page sequence="12">98 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology the population and the variety of industrial skill and knowledge are such as to render expedient a separation of employments, there a separation of employments will naturally take place; it seems to me that the tendency of Wakefield's scheme for requiring a "sufficient price" for land was to force on an artificial separation of employments at the cost of these condi- tions-density of population, etc.-under which alone separation of em- ployments is expedient or indeed permanently possible; his test of "suffi- ciency" having reference, not to the satisfying of the requirements of the colony (on which its attractiveness to the emigrants depends) but to the checking of the purchase of land. So far as this latter end is obtained without full compensation in the increased attractiveness of the colony, the effect must be to repel immigration-i.e., to prevent the realization of the conditions in which the separation of employment becomes expedient (37). Finally, yet another serious criticism of Wakefield's plan must be con- sidered in this exegesis. Neither the Mill-Cairnes correspondence, nor characteristically, Mill's Principles, reveals the very important practical limitations he imposed on the plan of Systematic Colonization, as it was frequently called. The occasion for these most negative comments on the issue under examination was a series of unsigned articles on the Irish poor by Mill that appeared in the Morning Chronicle the fall of 1846. Here, the burden of Mill's argument is to show that Wakefield's plan is not at all suitable for large-scale emigration that must be consummated in a short period of time. Thus, in a significant article in this series Mill sounds a theme he was to embellish in his Principles; namely, that the Irish should not be considered for emigration because of their excessive attachment to the soil and because of the greater opportunities afforded for colonization of the Irish waste lands. He also noted that due to the Irish temperament they would be singularly undesirable as harbingers of civilization to the colonial lands. But more importantly, Mill warns that "while we look with much favor upon systematic emigration as a branch of the general arrangements for maintaining a good economical condition, we do not think it equally well adapted for reforming a bad one, at least when the evil is excessive, and we think it peculiarly unsuited to the present condi- tions of Ireland"-which is to say not suited for coping with the foremost emigration problem of the time. But let Mill continue: the expenses of emigration [of the Irish] would be enormous, and we could scarcely expect that, like the expenses of locating the people on the waste lands, it would ever be repaid. The self-supporting scheme [of Wakefield's] is not adapted to carry off great numbers at once. It can only be brought into operation very gradually: its principle is, that the first who emigrate create by their labour both the means of transporting, and the fund for employing, those who follow. But a gradual process, to a people</page><page sequence="13">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics in the condition of the Irish, is a useless process. To Mill, Wakefield's program would be a "useless process" because it must fall victim to the population principle-a principle so important in Mill's thoughts on colonization and emigration. He notes that the Wake- fieldian plan is futile not just in relation to a potato famine. We should say it of the Irish as they were three years ago, no less than of the Irish as they are. Any relief of the labour market has a chance of being permanent only when it is great and sudden.... Unless it subtracts a sufficient number at once, and diminishes sufficiently the competition for employment to make the remainder feel themselves decidedly raised to the scale of physical comfort, it will make no change in the habits of the people, and the vacuum will speedily be again filled up. In Ireland nothing permanent would be accomplished . . . unless the resid- uary population were reduced to the numbers who could find regular em- ployment as labourers.... Mill concluded that the initial expenses of the emigration would have to be met by the government, and as experience indicates, probably without repayment from the colonists. The expenses of locating the same number of families on the Irish land would be only one-tenth of the emigration expenses, and consequently this is a much more desirable alternative (38). Nevertheless, throughout these penetrating attacks Wakefield continued to exercise an enormous influence, even with his critics. Spedding main- tains that the new theory of colonization is sound in principle. Merivale terminates his critique of Wakefield with this peroration: "Never was there a more remarkable instance of the success of a principle against all manner of misapprehension-against the fear of innovation-against corrupt in- terests-against the inert resistance which all novelty is sure to encounter" (39). To understand the reluctance of the economists to altogether give up the Wakefield program even after undermining the very core of the doctrine, is to understand the nature of the influence of Wakefield on classical economics. IV THE BASIS OF WAKEFIELD'S INFLUENCE ON CLASSICAL ECONOMICS WAKEFIELD ALWAYS EMPHASIZED that the sufficient price was the indis- pensable element in his system the acceptance of which did not require approval of the other aspects of his program. He did believe that his pro- posal for colonial self-government and selective emigration from all social strata and both sexes, and especially young married couples, would make colonization easier, given a colonial lands sales policy based on his doc- trines. The quantity and quality of the emigrating forces would be en- 99</page><page sequence="14">100 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology hanced; and he felt these policies would certainly be instrumental in devel- oping an old world society in the new world-a cherished dream-in the shortest period of time. Likewise the provision for using the proceeds of land sales to defray the costs of immigration was advocated by Wake- field. In the first place this would permit a lower price on the lands than otherwise; and secondly, he was keenly aware of the political appeal of a plan that transferred the cost of the emigration to the colony (40). To his followers, however, much greater weight was given to these supple- mentary features. The reasons for this difference in emphasis merits close attention. Several writers anticipated Wakefield in advocating the sale of colonial land for financing the emigration to the colonies (41). But it was not until Wakefield's felicitous exposition that this method of financing be- came popular with the leading economists of the day. Here is to be found the basis for most of the encomiums given Wakefield's system. Generally, writers on political economy were disappointed over the political failure of Wilmot-Horton's plan for financing the emigration because of its burdensome expenses, based as it was on mortgaging poor rates with the parishes finally bearing responsibility for repayment. They were even less attracted to the alternative emigration plans since these required taxation of wages in the colonies, at best a risky undertaking; or to those which relied on private philanthropy that was uncertain and inadequate. Some pro- posals simply asked that the emigrant bear the expenses of the emigration, which was no policy at all. Wakefield's plan for financing the emigration through land sales and colonial rent taxes, irrespective of nice calculations of a "sufficient price," seemed to belong with the great discoveries of knowledge (42), and in Merivale's words "in reality forms the great dis- covery of Mr. Wakefield, and does the greatest credit to those who have supported and enforced his views" (43). Most of the eminent economists of the day were attracted to Wakefield because of this technique of financing colonization. Senior was critical of the sufficient price-his oft-quoted praise of Wakefield concerns only selective emigration and especially the provision for the emigration fund through land sales (44). Torrens was converted to Wakefield when the latter convinced Torrens that this restrictive price would not compel an uneconomical recourse to inferior soils; and as Lord Robbins pointed out Torrens completely reversed Wakefield's emphasis on the sufficient price. His argument emphasizes the setting of the price at such a level as to meet the expenses of the emigration to the colonies. This is consonant with the earlier phases of Torrens' thought. Torrens finally outdid Wake-</page><page sequence="15">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics field in believing that the public lands in the developing colonies would appreciate to such an extent that land sales could be used to finance a general development of the colonies as well as the emigration to the col- onies (45). Jeremy Bentham, for whom the doctrine of the sufficient price was "incontestably established," was converted to the idea of colonization as a means of alleviating Britain's economic ills shortly before he heard of Wakefield. He became a follower of Wakefield, suggested the writing of the latter's England and America, and drew up the plans for the Coloniza- tion Society which was formed to sponsor Wakefield's program. The un- published Bentham Mss. indicate that Bentham was attracted to Wakefield simply because he believed that the sufficient price would assure the eco- nomic success of the colony as well as shift the heavy burden of financing the venture from the mother country to the colony (46). When the young J. S. Mill first gave his attention to this question of emigration and coloni- zation he noted quickly that any emigration scheme presented to the public must pay the expenses of the initial and succeeding emigrations, and that the best proposal was the one recently presented 'of fixing a price upon [colonial] waste land . . . [and] that the system should be established by act of Parliament, not by a mere regulation, revo- cable at the pleasure of any colonial minister, and . . . the produce of the sales of land should be wholly devoted to emigration, and to the emigration of young couples, in order that the greatest effect may be produced on the future growth of population, by the removal of the smallest number of individuals' (47). A few years later he added that colonization could "afford a sensible relief to the overcrowded labourers and capitalists of the mother country" though he (later) rightfully concluded that this followed from the logic of the classical economic analysis given certain institutional restraints. Quite early he also capitulated to the logic of the sufficient price though he was always mindful of the cost-defraying aspects of the program (48); and, as indicated earlier, proscribed the Wakefield Plan when immediate large- scale emigration was necessary. v CONCLUSION THUS THE NATURE of the Wakefield influence on classical economics was not on general policy since, by and large, most economists of the day favored some plan of emigration and/or colonization. This influence de- rived from Wakefield's plan for financing the emigration to the colonists which in itself was a by-product of the pivotal feature of his program, the restrictive price that was to be placed on colonial land sales. To a 101</page><page sequence="16">102 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology somewhat lesser extent this sufficient price doctrine was a factor accounting for his influence. However, just as the economic case for colonization dis- appeared from the minds of most economists in Wakefield's time when free trade appeared politically feasible (49), likewise, as a matter of course, free trade relegated to the limbo of academics his contribution on the tech- nique of colonization and experiments in empire building. So Merivale, in appending a note in 1861 to a reprint of his Oxford lectures, specifically that part covering the disposal of colonial lands and colonial self-govern- ment, claimed that these topics are no longer so imperative because "the development of free trade and consequent prosperity of England robbed the 'emigration' question of all that pressing interest which attached to it when these lectures were delivered" two decades ago (50). Perhaps Wakefield would not have been too piqued had he read this in far away New Zealand. He had already admitted (1848) that coloniza- tion and free trade were competitive solutions to Britain's economic prob- lems; surely Mill's position would have prepared him against any undue shock (51). And if this were not sufficient, Scrope and Senior had fore- warned him three decades earlier that their pleas for colonization were given only in the absence of institutional reform, including free trade (52). Perhaps Wakefield was solaced by the memory of the lively dis- cussion he started during this interval, even though he didn't develop the alphabet he thought that the science of political economy so needed (53). But one thing seems clear: Had Wakefield never introduced his ever- publicized capital-glut argument for colonization, his influence on classical economic thought would not have been materially different, or less signifi- cant, or less ephemeral (54). Of course, one question has been glaringly neglected. Why did the "greats" in the classical tradition not catch on to Wakefield's essentially non-economic manner of thinking reflected in the sufficient price program? They did have a very rough analytical apparatus of a market mechanism that resulted in a more-or-less efficient ordering force in terms of resource allo- cation (though not resource rewards) (55). Ricardian rent discussion is a classic example of embryonic marginal analysis; and J. S. Mill explicitly used alternative cost analysis (56). But recognition of the principle of substitution was not in the Ricardian technique. Because of the near obsession with land as the limiting factor in economic growth, it appears impossible for a Ricardian to consider anything but "doses" of capital and labor being applied consecutively to a given amount of land. To consider substitution of the capital-labor "dosage" for land was foreign to their overall developmental conceptions.</page><page sequence="17">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics Interestingly, the micro-critics of Wakefield covered in this paper were followers of Smith. But this doesn't explain much; or so it seems. The principle of substitution is likewise missing in Adam Smith, as a reading of Smith's famous chapter "On the Natural and Market Price of Com- modities" will reveal (57). Perhaps one may be permitted to beg off at this point by suggesting a more detailed examination of the periodical literature, governmental reports, etc. of this period. The history of eco- nomic thought would suggest that perhaps a more sophisticated micro- analytical apparatus was "in the air," at least in some quarters. Working backwards from the Colonial Office at that time would be a good place to begin the investigation. Northern Illinois University DeKalb, Ill. 60115 Appendix A The Interchange Between Scrope and Wakefield PERHAPS THE MOST VIVID, and ironic, illustration of the limited and specific content of Wakefield's influence on the classical economists is reflected strikingly in the curious in- terchange between George Poullet Scrope and Wakefield in 1836. That year Wakefield was the star witness before the parliamentary committee convened to study the disposal of lands in the colony. In fact, Wakefield had been the prime mover in having this committee appointed to discuss publicly his method of colonization. Earlier Wakefield had printed a speech of Scrope's on colonization in the appendix of one of his own books (58). J. S. Mill had announced that same year that Scrope was a convert to the new theory of colonization (59). Already the impressionistic evaluation of Wakefield's influence on classical economics was beginning. Scrope's appendix to Wakefield's book did not praise the sufficient price; Scrope was impressed with the method a price on land afforded for meeting the expenses of emigration. This was an obvious improvement over his own plan of meeting the expenses through a tax on colonial wages. In fact, three years earlier, in a very critical article on Wakefield in the Quarterly Review, and in which he had presented his own plan for financing the emigration, Scrope even accused the Wakefield groups of having some pecuniary interest of their own in advocating the sale of colonial lands at a rela- tively high price; no other motive seemed feasible. And Wakefield had singled out this anonymous article for attack in his England and America (60). Before the parliamentary committee this latent schism exploded. Obviously puzzled over the continual tense exchange with Scrope, Wakefield produced a very laudatory letter from Scrope concerning the former's England and America. Scrope had penned that he could not remember "ever reading any work with greater interest, or more thoroughly going along with any author in his views, opinions, and sentiments" than in this book. He went on to say that he had long been a friend of colonization as the great healer of the nation's economic ills, "but the notions which were but vaguely float- ing in my mind, I find methodized and arranged in more lucid and convincing order in your work" (61). Wakefield was surprised when Scrope replied he had a strong favorable opinion of the 103</page><page sequence="18">104 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology general scope of the book without agreeing to every particular contained in it. Scrope then clarified the issue between them by saying that the part of the book he had in mind when he wrote his letter pertained to the provision for an emigration fund. Of course, Wakefield replied that this aspect of his system was only incidental to the basis of his plan, which was the sufficient price (62). Thus, Scrope felt called upon to place himself as a witness before the committee in opposition to the pro-Wakefield arguments that had appeared before the committee, since he had "been inclined to think, from the first time that I saw [Wakefield's theory] promulgated in [his] publications . .. it was founded on a fallacy, and dangerous, if carried practically into operation, to the very object we all have in view" (63). He returned quickly to an old theme. Scrope testified that "it is cheapness of land that is the general cause of high wages and of the rapid advance in most colonies . . . which I think alone [are the considerations which] should determine the question of price" (64). Scrope's ensuing critique of the sufficient price did not follow the Colonial Office ap- proach. Rather he directed his attack around issues mentioned earlier in this paper: the diversion of emigration to cheaper lands, the difficulties of determining the sufficient price, etc. He closed his testimony with a four point program of his own which in- cluded the sale of colonial lands to provide for the expenses of selective emigration (65); and nearly four decades later he continued to maintain that it was the cheapness of colonial land that resulted in high wages and the rapid advance of most colonies (66). * Sections of this paper have benefited from the criticism of Professor George J.

In advocating a modern price on the colonial lands he would stip- ulate the maximum number of acres that could be purchased by individuals given the capital of these individuals, and a provision for the grant of land to revert to the public if improvements on the land are not made within a certain period of time. A high price for the land was thought to hinder the progress of the colony since the fund for clearing and cultivating the land was deleted, as well as reducing the demand for labor. How- ever, the making of land "artificially dear" was compensated to some extent by making labor "artificially cheap." But he insisted continually that in general "a regard for their own interest will draw people sufficiently together." 20. To those who object to "reading into" earlier thought modern precepts, one may cite the reply in The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, ed. by Joseph E. Stigtitz, 2 vols. (Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1966), II, p. 1097: ". . . there is a worse sin than the anthropomorphic one of reading modern analysis into old writers' works. There is in addition the sophisticated-anthropomorphic sin of not recognizing the equivalent content in older writers because they do not use the terminology and symbols of the present." 21.

Similarly, Robert Torrens' Colonization of South Australia (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1835), p. 13. Torrens added that "There is, in every country some proportion or other between capital and labour which is most conducive to the progress of wealth and which gives the highest rate of profit and of wages which the state of industry and the quality of the soil render possible." The only factor price deemed relevant was that of land; and this was to be made artificially high.</page><page sequence="20">106 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology See also the Wakefield quote in footnote 40. 22.

These natural conditions (he writes) were the low cost of clearing lands and ease of road construction, etc., the easy acquisition of pastoral land and the rapid creation of wealth in sheep farming; these permit the capitalists to pay higher prices for land, than say, in Canada, where land clearance is very costly. Moreover, high wages would hold the propertyless labourer content for a longer period of time. Merivale's conclusion on these export-producing colonies deserves quoting: "The usual course of events appears to be this: that it is not until the most fertile and best situated lands have been occupied, and to a certain extent exhausted, that the superior productiveness of capital in masses, and labour in combination, begins to be practically felt. The stimulus, too, afforded by an increasing market acts strongly in accelerating this inevitable change; and it is, at least, highly probable, that it may be still further accelerated by measures taken at the outset; by taking thought for the adjustment of the due proportion of capital and labour in the original foundation of the colony." See pp. 270-71. 31. Merivale, pp. 276, 425. 32. Ibid., pp. 424-25. Wakefield could have replied that Merivale's concept of the source of rent was too narrow. See my "Wakefield and Classical Rent Theory," loc. cit. 33. Merivale, p. 439. 34. The Economist, 14 February, 1874, in its obituary of Merivale wrote that "he was the first Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, and in that capacity delivered and published a series of very remarkable lectures on 'Colonization' which attracted great attention at that time. The controversies with which they deal have now passed away. The Wakefield system of colonization, after stimulating the growth of our colonies at the Antipodes, is now abandoned, but anyone who has any curiosity on the subject will find that, while it was an untried suggestion, Mr. Merivale accurately criticized its merits and its defects, and showed how it would succeed, and where it would fail, almost as correctly as experience afterwards proved. There are few acuter arguments in economical litera- ture, and still fewer better written." This is also cited in Charles Merivale, "Herman Merivale, C. B.," Reprinted from the Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, and Art, 1884-xvi, pp. 8-9. We have by no means exhausted the extensive critique of Wakefield rendered by Merivale. His central thesis, however, was pervasive. Thus in his criticism of the claim that the rise of slavery in Greece and in North America conforms to Wakefield's prin- ciples, Merivale notes that in South Australia concentration did not materialize in this "model colony," and concludes: "This, argue the supporters of the theory, only proves that the price of land is not high enough, and ought to be raised. It would be possible, no doubt, to raise it; but the moment that the intended compression began to make itself felt, the operations of the squatter would interfere, and no government could prevent the unlicensed occupation of land if it persisted in excluding colonists from the lawful acquisition of the best within their reach. The only ascertainable principle on the sub- ject appears to be this,-that the tendency to dispersion will in all cases be greater in proportion to the value of the produce of the soil. The greater the profit to be drawn from the land, the more certainly the temptation of occupying the most fertile portions will prevail in the mind of the settler over attachment to society, and the feeling of the inconveniences which that dispersion must occasion. All artificial methods of restricting the extension of a colony over the surface, and cramping it, like a Chinese lady's foot, according to some imaginary standard of elegant proportion, seem injurious; such, for example, as the plan of continuous surveys, by which the government only offers adjacent</page><page sequence="21">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics 107 portions of territory to purchasers in succession, instead of acceding to the wishes of the settlers themselves, by surveying at once those for which the greatest desire is manifested, within a reasonable distance of the nucleus of the settlement. For the most part, such methods are fortunately impracticable; that is, the squatter, who is the natural corrector of land monopolies, as the smuggler is of commercial, would render them to a great extent nugatory. But in whatever degree they could be carried into effect, in the same propor- tion the young community would be checked in the development of its vigorous principle of expansion" (pp. 426-47). 35.

He also maintained that the dispersion in the colonies itself reflects a beneficial division of labor since the pioneers "select the best lands, cut down the forest, and roughly till the soil, as a preparation for the more regular efforts of others." (P. 230). Crawfurd was the immediate occasion for Torrens to write his Colonization of South Australia.

Torrens, Systematic Colonization. Ireland Saved, Without Cost to the Imperial Treasury. Second Edition. To Which is Prefixed an Introductory Letter to Earl Grey, The Results of the Emigration Branch of the South Australian Experiment (London: Trelawney Saunders, 1849), advocated the emigration of the Irish, the expenses to be paid in the first instance by advances from the government and secured by Irish rent charges and poor rates. However, costs would, in the final analysis, be defrayed from land sales in the colonies, where the land would appreciate in value following the immigration. Torrens had none of Mill's misgivings. However, by 1854, McCulloch saw no need for a publicly supported emigration. For a discussion of the tragic consequences of the fail- ure of an effective program of state assisted emigration to materialize in support of the Irish, see Oliver MacDonagh, "Irish Emigration to the United States of America and the British Colonies During the Famine," in The Great Famine: Studies in Irish History, 1845-1852, R.

Thus in an early essay Wakefield wrote on colonization, Sketch of a Proposal for Colonizing Australia (London: J. F. Dove, 1829), p. 42, he noted that "all the expenses</page><page sequence="22">108 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology of the measure itself, that is, the whole cost of surveys, of the collection of rent-tax, and of Emigration, would, of course, be at once defrayed by the proceeds of rent-tax and sales." The most influential newspaper to give early support to Wakefield, e.g. in "Emi- gration Schemes," The Spectator, March 13, 1830, p. 162, contrasts the costless Wakefield program with that of the burdensomely expensive plan of Wilmot-Horton.

Ridgway, 1831), pp. 35-36 where Wakefield attacks Wilmot- Horton's plan as too expensive, and thus causing doubts about the efficacy of emigration in general. Respecting the level of the suffcient price and the formation of an emigration fund, Wakefield testified: "The object of requiring a price is combinable labour in the colony; combinable labour being a certain number of people in proportion to land. If the money obtained by the sale of land were employed as an emigration fund, the proportion would be altered, the proportion of people would be increased; therefore, I say, if you employ the land fund as an emigration fund, the price ought to be less, in order to maintain the same proportions of people to land."

In these circumstances the plan of dealing with waste lands that was temporarily carried out in the Australian Colonies cannot properly be called Wakefield's scheme: since, as he reiteratedly affirmed, his 'sufficient price' was never really tried, and that was his cardinal point." 44.

In Senior's Sessional Papers: Report on the Condition of the Un- employed Handloom Weavers, X (1841), pp. 118-19, he seems more sympathetic to the sufficient price than in his Oxford lectures nearly a decade later. Even in this report, however, he is cognizant of the importance of land sales in financing the emigration. Henry Fawcett-Manual of Political Economy, 3rd ed. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1869), pp. 59-62-like so many, could speak favorably of the new doctrine on "concen- tration," yet completely oppose them elsewhere (p. 418). 45.

And one of the proposed ends of</page><page sequence="23">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics the colonization society's program was the relief of "a great part [of] the remaining portion of the population of the Mother Country from the pressure of a continually in- creasing state of indigence from which they cannot at present be relieved but by a con- tinually increasing tax imposed upon the people of all degrees above the lowest scale of opulence."

See the writer's "Development of the Theory of Colonization...." 50. Merivale, p. 535 note. In his final lecture in 1841, he looked with favor upon a British commonwealth of nations (pp. 622-35). He added a long appendix in 1860 in which he advocates colonization in particular cases if the net return through trade with the colony exceed the cost of governing the colony, or, as in the case of the now inde- pendent United States, of the costs of establishing the colony, if the colony aids in the defense of the mother country, and above all, if the colony affords an outlet for the younger and more adventurous spirits in the population of the mother country. How- ever, he is quick to add that colonization is not simply a question of profit and loss: the civilizing mission, the spreading of English civilization, is uppermost in his mind (p. 675). He concludes that "rash indeed, would be he who should presage more than a temporary duration for that calm of prosperity and contentment which our colonial empire now enjoys. We can count but little on the permanence of common interests ..., [and] whenever the disruption may arrive . . . if we are but true to our principles . . . undis- turbed by those fierce gusts of passion which such a catastrophe excites . . . [we shall find] that the tie of subjection to a common crown . . . is in truth but a slight and temporary thing, while the alliance of blood, and language, and religion bids fair to sub- sist as long as human society endures" (p. 677). By 1870 he believes that his lectures of 1841 were outdated because "with the colonial trade thrown open, and colonization at an end, it is obvious that the leading motives which induced our ancestors to found and to maintain a colonial empire no longer exist." See his "The Colonial Question in 1870," Fortnightly Review, January, 1870, p. 155. Ironically, students place the begin- nings of the strong late 19th century imperialist movement in England from this date. Thus, C. A.

In Merivale's introduction to his reprinted lectures he says that in the lectures he had in mind "to lead the minds of my hearers to the consideration of some elementary principles in Political Economy which are illustrated by the phenomena of colonization and the growth of colonies .. ." (p. xi, 1861 ed.). Even when he speaks of colonization alleviating a general glut, he is in the classical tradition for he speaks of relief to a "tem- porary plethora or oppression" of capital ((pp. 184-85). However, he did erroneously interpret the Ricardian-Say version of the law of markets as an identity, never allowing for cyclical disturbances in the economy. Wakefield, however, in the preface to his edition of the Wealth of Nations claimed that "even the alphabet of the science [of political economy]-the meaning of every common term, whether used by the vulgar or by the most learned professors is still un- settled. There is scarcely a term of any weight which is not employed by different per- sons, and even by the same persons, to express different meanings; while the known prin- ciples of the science leave unexplained some of its most important phenomena [e.g. colonization]."

(London: Charles Knight and Co., 1843), I, p. xii. 54. Aside from his influence on classical economics, Wakefield's alleged influence on the course of official colonial policy has been challenged recently by June Philipp, "Wake- 109</page><page sequence="24">110 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology fieldian Influence and New South Wales: 1830-32," Historical Studies: Australian and New Zealand, May, 1960, pp. 173-80. Professor Philipps maintains that the tenor of official policy had been in the direction of land sales in the colonies for some time prior to Wakefield; his arrival on the scene simply provided a more sophisticated rationale for what was to transpire anyway. This is not an unusual occurence. For the rejoinder see Peter Burroughs, "Wakefield and the Ripon Regulations," ibid., April, 1965, pp. 452-56. In defense of Professor Philipp, there is yet to be shown how Wakefield's proposals, which first appeared in print in 1829, and written while he was in prison, were actually trans- formed into policy in the extremely short span of two years, in a far distant land, thereby changing abruptly the content of colonial land policy. If nothing else, the nature of bureaucratic inertia and the difficulties of transoceanic communication which beset the era should caution one against interpretations that emphasize such discontinuity in colo- nial land policy. Professor Burroughs does not resolve these doubts, at least to this writer. H. M. Robertson, "The Cape of Good Hope and 'Systematic Colonization'," South African Journal of Economics, December, 1937, pp. 366-411 also argues in favor of the influence of Wakefield. Another facet of Wakefield might be more fruitful. Trygve Haavelmo, A Study in the Theory of Economic Evolution (Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Co., 1954), p. 8, suggests that Smith's views on the beneficial effects to the colonies from the knowl- edge, and skills, and culture received from the old world through immigration contains essentials to form an admissible theory of economic growth. Alfred Marshall, Industry and Trade (London: Macmillan, 1919), pp. 142-43, and Principle of Economics (Lon- don: Macmillan, 1925), pp. 197, 668-71 follows this aspect of Smith in seeking under- standing of the rapid growth in colonies. Wakefield embellished this theme of Smith's at length when he pleaded for consummating the colonization process in one great effort encompassing the emigration of individuals from all social and economic classes. This was to raise markedly the chances of the colonies' success, given suitable land disposal policies. See H. O. Pappe, "Wakefield and Marx," Economic History Review, No. 1, 1961, pp. 88-97. Winch, passim, has argued that Wakefield's emphasis on the export- staple is reminiscent of the theme of Professor Douglas North on the importance of this factor in economic growth. However, see Edward J. Chambers and Donald F. Gordon, "Primary Products and Economic Growth: An Empirical Measurement," Journal of Po- litical Economy, April, 1966, pp. 315-32. 55. See my, "'Laissez Faire" in English Classical Economics," Journal of History of Ideas, October-December, 1966, pp. 619-20, and the references cited therein. 56. George J. Stigler, Essays in the History of Economics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 8. 57. Thus in the adjustment of the quantity supplied of a commodity to its "effectual demand" so as to equate the natural price with the market price, Smith simply envisaged a process of "withdrawal" from the market of the respective high price unit. Char- acteristically, there is no recognition of the role of substituting low cost inputs for some or all of the high cost inputs in facilitating production adjustments. See Wealth of Nations, pp. 56-58. 58.

(George Poulett Scropte), "Malthus and Sadler-Population and Emigration," Quarterly Review, April, 1831, p. 143. Even in this early article, Scrope was critical of the sufficient price doctrine. Scrope thought also that colonization could alleviate a capital glut in a country-but he discussed this in terms of cyclical, not stagnationist, disturbances in the economy, as did many others; and thus held to the classical law of markets. See Scrope's, Principles of Political Economy deduced from the Natural Laws of Social Welfare, and Applied to the Present State of Britain (London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1833), pp. 211-16; idem, "The Political Econ- omists," Quarterly Review, January 1831, pp. 23-25. From this he argued that the colo- nial trade was more secure than a free trade to a country since the free trade was not</page><page sequence="25">Wakefield's Scheme of Colonization and Economics universal. See also my "Development of the Theory of Colonization . . . ," pp. 202-203. For Wakefield's criticism of Scrope's (anonymous) article, see his England and America .. , pp. 294-97. Whatever the truth in Scrope's charge that the Wakefieldians had a personal economic interest in colonization, Wakefield's papers would add substance to the charges. See the Wakefield papers, B.M. Add. Mss., No. 35, 261 (1815-1853), where he mentions the personal fortune being made in the colonies by one of the promoters of the plan of land sales there. 61.

[which] I consider something like the ... . 'summum bonum' of the old philosophies; something more easy to seek than to find, to talk about than to lay down in an Act of Parliament." In any case, a high price would direct emigration away from the colony to the United States. (P. 687). 66. G. P.

A completely negative attitude is found in Alfred Webb, "The Progress of the Colony of Victoria," Journal of the Dublin Statistical Society, October, 1856, pp. 361-72; also John Lancelot Shadwell, A System of Political Economy (London: Trubner and Co., 1877), pp. 483-85. Taxes Impoverish the Poor THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE, Catholic Rural Life, points out that "During 1967, 150 Americans reported adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more each and yet did not pay any income tax." It goes on: "Among these citizens were 21 with incomes of over $1 million. Meanwhile, 25 million citizens with income under $3,000 per year paid $1.5 billion in federal income taxes." With social security payroll taxes on top of the income taxes, and with sales taxes added to this, it is evident that the tax structure is one of the chief causes of poverty in the United States and of the inordinate riches that some exploiters are able to pile up.
