<plain_text><page sequence="1">Les Machines Ã  penser. By Louis Couffignal. [Pp. 153, with 27 figures.] (Paris : Les Editions de Minuit, 1952. Frs. 755-.) This book will stimulate considerable discussion in both lay and scientific circles. The title, in itself, sows the seeds of dissent since there is a growing body of opinion, in this country at least, against the habit of attributing reasoning powers to programmed digital calculating machines. In the first chapter, the author seeks to answer the question " What is a machine ? " and suggests, among other things, " an inanimate assemblage capable of replacing man in a group of operations." This, together with his opening remark that education should enable one to " read, write and calculate," sets the tone of the argument. Chapter two considers machines " which add and which write."

A brief account of the Burroughs (incidentally misspelled in Fig. 4) printing adder gives the author further scope for anthropomorphic comparisons. Chapter three, on punched card machines, and chapter four, on universal digital computers, are the least satisfactory of the book. They are too con- densed to be useful to the layman and contain nothing new for the expert. Chapter five, " Analogue Computers," starts with a discussion on the nature of continuity and of rational and irrational numbers ; ignoring simpler mechanisms, the author proceeds straight to the differential analyser and a discussion of negative feed back. Chapter six, " Calculating Machines and the Nervous System," and chapter seven, " The Mechanisation of Logic," are the most stimulating in the whole book. Physiologists may not accept the suggestion that a synapse is a form of transistor, but the idea is interesting, as are M. Couffignal's sugges- tions regarding the nature of memory and the possible differences between the thought processes of children and adults. Chapter eight outlines the programme of future work envisaged by the author and draws together some of the ideas of earlier chapters ; there is also a " postface " and a table of contents. The book, which is paper covered in the French manner, should be read rather as a provocation than as a course of instruction and, as such, forms a useful addition to the literature. Andrew D.
