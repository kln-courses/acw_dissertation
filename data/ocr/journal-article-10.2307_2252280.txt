<plain_text><page sequence="1">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE ANIMAL WORLD IN his paper, " Teleological and Functional Explanations ",' Rolf Gruner shows that one should distinguish between teleological explanations in which the explicans gives a cause of the explicandum (explanations which Gruner calls " teleological explanations in the narrow sense ") and teleological explanations in which the explicans gives an effect of the explicandum (" functional explanations "). In this note, whilst agreeing that there are these two kinds of teleological explanation,2 I want to show that Gruner is wrong in two subsidiary claims. In particular, I shall argue that Gruner is wrong to claim that sound teleological explanations (in the narrow sense) are re- stricted to the human world, and he is equally wrong in his claim that the attempt by workers such as Nagel to explain non-human actions in terms of " goal-directed " behaviour " has too much of an anthropomorphic flavour " (p. 516). 1. A Teleological Explanation in Biology3 A phenomenon which has long intrigued biologists is the fact that many species of birds have a remarkably stable clutch-size. For example, the clutch of a petrel is normally 1, of a pigeon 2, and of a plover 4. Now one kind of explanation of these clutches that might be demanded is a functional explanation. It might be asked what function the clutches serve, and it is easy both to give the right answer and to see that the explanation fits Gruner's pattern for func - tional explanations. The function of bird-clutches is to give rise to offrspring and thus to ensure the continuation of the particular species. Moreover, the thing which is being explained, the clutches of birds, is a cause of the function which is involved, namely the giving rise to offspring and the continuation of the species. Because the birds lay the eggs there are offspring and the species continues, rather than vice-versa. However, even if one has asked the functional question and been given the functional explanation, there still remains something which needs explaining. Why, for example, should the plover lay exactly 4 eggs (and the other birds the exact numbers that they do)? We know the function of the 4 eggs, but we do not know why there are exactly 4 eggs. Indeed, paradoxically, knowing the function makes this question even more pressing, because as the function of the eggs is to ensure the future of the species, one might expect a bird to lay the maximum number of eggs that it (physiologically) 1 Mind, vol. lxxv, 1966, pp. 516-26. 2 I have myself made this distinction on rather different grounds in my paper, " Functional Statements in Biology," Philosophy of Science, vol. xxxviii, 1971, pp. 87-95. 3 Like Gruner, if I talk in an unqualified way about teleology, I shall be referring to the narrower sense. 433</page><page sequence="2">434 M. RUSE: can. But, it is clear that birds do not, in fact, do this, because if eggs are taken during laying, the bird will usually lay more eggs to bring the clutch up to the normal size. Hence, it is clear that some kind -of additional explanation is called for at this point, and the explanation of clutch-size which is usually accepted by biologists has best been put by David Lack. He argues that " in most birds clutch-size has been evolved through natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can on the average find enough food "'.1 Now on the face of it, it is hard to deny that this explanation has a teleological flavour. One can certainly imagine a rather naive person ascribing to birds the intention of laying the number of eggs which they can best handle, since, prima facie, the explanation is almost identical to the kind of explanation that humans might give of themselves. Why, for example, have the Ruses no more than 2 children? Because this fits in with our purpose or intention- namely to raise the maximum number that we can, whilst maintain- ing a certain standard of living. However, although the biological explanation has a teleological ring to it-clutch-size is in some sense the result of the optimum number that the parents will be able to raise (in the future), that is, the 'purpose ' of a particular clutch-size is to ensure the maximum number of successful offsprin 'g-it is clear that biologists do not really suppose irreplaceable teleology, nor even do they suppose avian desires. Lack qualifies his explanation by adding that " on this view, the upper limit of clutch-size is set by the fact that, with more young that this, some are undernourished, and so the parents tend to leave fewer, not more descendants than those with broods of the normal size " (pp. 22-23). Similarly, the lower limit of clutch-size is also set by the fact that the parents (this time with smaller clutch-sizes) tend to leave fewer, not more descen- dants than those with broods of the normal size. In other words, the fact that a particular bird, say the plover, has a particular number of eggs (4), is due to the egg-number optimum (for the species) having been that numnber in the past. Because it has been so in the past, natural selection has so regulated it that the present generation will be able to produce just this number. Should futuxe conditions be like the past, then this will indeed be the optimum number for this generation and the futuxe. Should conditions change drastically, then it is quite possible that another number, say 3 or 5, would have been better. In the light of what has just been said, let us now consider this explanation of clutch-size, with respect to Gruner's division of teleological explanations. There are two facts which cannot be denied. First, the explanation clearly has a teleological air to it. In a broad sense of teleology, it must be called " teleological ". Secondly, the explanation is not about humans, but neither is it a 1 The Natural Regulation of Animal Number8, p. 22.

It is about birds, and needs answering even after we have answered questions about functions. This means that Gruner must be prepared, either to extend his definition of "teleological explanation" (in the narrow sense) to include some non-human phenomena, or he must be prepared to admit a third kind of explanation, teleological in the broad sense but neither teleological in the narrow sense (as he understands it, i.e. as it applies to humnans) nor functional. What I suggest is that he should be prepared to expand his notion of " teleological" (in the narrow sense). The reason for this is simply that in the kind of explanation we have been considering, the explicans gives us the cause of clutch-size, not the effect. In the case of the plover, because in the past the optimum number of eggs proved to be 4, present plovers also lay 4. It is not the case that because plovers lay 4 eggs that this turns out to be the optimum clutch-size. In other words, upon analysis, this explanation turns out to be very much like one of Gruner's teleological explanations, since the explicandum states the effect and not the cause. For this reason, I suggest that Gruner should recognize that his definition of " teleological explanation " (taken in a narrow sense) ranges over non-human actions as well as human actions. 2. The Problem of Goal-directedness Together with his claim that teleological explanations properly apply solely to humans, Gruner also decries attempts (e.g. Nagel's) to give analyses of non-human goal-directed behaviour. The second thing I shall do in this note is show that the phenomenon we have just been discussing, clutch-size in birds, is brought about by goal- directed behaviour of the very type which is considered by Nagel.1 Nagel's analysis of " goal-directed " behaviour or, more generally, "directively organized " systemas is fairly sophisticated, but the essential ideas can be presented quickly. We assume that we have a system which either exhibits some property or mode of behaviour, or which, if left untouched, would at some later point exhibit G (more briefly, we assume that we have a system which is " in a G-state "). We also assume that the system can be analysed into a number of different independent parts or processes. On top of this we make the assumption that were one of these parts altered on its own and were there no compensating alterations in the other parts, then the system would cease to exhibit G (or, if G has not yet been attained, would never reach G). Such a system is said to be " goal- directed " or " directively organized " if, whenever one of the parts is disrupted (within certain limits), the other parts alter in a compen- sating manner, so as to keep the system in a state of exhibiting G, or to leave the system in such a state that G will at some point be exhibited (without external help). It is, of course, recognized that 1 The Structure of Science, pp. 410-18. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961.</page><page sequence="4">436 M. RUSE: TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS some disruptions might be so great that the system could never get back to G. The initial disruption is called the " primary variation ", and the compensating moves are called " adaptive variations ". Referring now back to the explanation of clutch-sizes in birds, it is fairly easy to show that we do there have cases of systems which satisfy the above definition of directive organization. We have systems, namely populations or species of birds. These systems can be analysed into different independent parts, namely the individual birds. At a certain time of year these birds exhibit a specific property, namely the laying of eggs in certain clutch-sizes. At other times of the year, the birds do not exhibit this property, but if left untouched and given time, they will exhibit the property again (i.e. in the next spring). Hence, the systems are in G-states. Sup- pose now that one of these parts of a system (i.e. a bird) is altered- say one of the birds carries a new mutation, so that it has a different clutch-size from the norm. For example, if it is a plover, then it might have 3 eggs or 5 eggs rather than the normal 4 eggs. This is a primary variation. If nothing else changes, then the system will no longer (and never will again) have the G-state it was in previously. The clutch-size of at least some of the members will always be differ- ent from 4 (we are assuming fairly normal inheritance, a large popu- lation, and random interbreeding). However, what happens in reality is that the rest of the system compensates for this change in the clutch-size of one bird, and the compensating changes are enough to bring the system back to the original G-state (e.g. state of laying 4 eggs). In particular, what happens is that certain other parts of the system (i.e. other birds) do things which they would not have done, had the original disruption (i.e. the mutation) not occurred. Because of the disruption, these other birds (with normal clutch-size tendencies) will reproduce, when they would not normally have done so. This is because the mutant bird will either have fewer offspring or, if it has more offspring, have weakened offspring. Assuming the first alternative, other birds will be able to reproduce because there will be no competition at all, and assuming the second alternative, the other birds will be able to reproduce because they will be stronger than their competitors (possibly they will be able to push the com- petitors out, or possibly, the competitors will fall by the wayside for other reasons, e.g. the weather). In either case, those birds genetic- ally programmed for normal clutch-size will have the upper-edge, and because of this, they will be the ones which are selected. Hence, the population will gradually be brought back to a state of exhibiting G (i.e. normal clutch-size), through adaptive variations. It is clear that we have here a paradigmatic example of a goal- directed system as defined by Nagel, and it is also clear that it is in no sense anthropomorphic. Therefore, one can conclude immediately that Gruner's unease at the thought of non-human goal-directed systems is unwarranted. University of Guelph MICHAEL RusE</page></plain_text>
