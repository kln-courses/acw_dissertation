<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRIUMPHATOR AND ANCESTOR RITUALS BETWEEN SYMBOLIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND MAGIC1 J?rg R?pke Summary This article argues that the Roman triumph with the figure of the triumphator and the burial of Roman nobles with the pompa imaginum should be interpreted within the framework of the prestige and practices related to honorific statues. Using the red colour of the triumphator's skin as the main argument, the figure of the triumphator is interpreted as a temporary statue, and the triumph as an attempt on part of the senate to regulate the prestige of honorific statues by tying it to a public ritual. Likewise, the bearers of imagines are interpreted as representing the ensemble of all legitimate ? i.e. as based on public positions ? statues used to construct a family. Both rituals, as known from late republican sources, developed from the fourth century bc onwards. 1. Symbolic Communication Two rituals of the Roman republic have recently become the subject of intense research: the triumph; and the public funeral granted to Roman magistrates, with its mask-wearing actors, its imper sonated ancestors, and its speeches of praise and commemoration. 1 For discussions of the ideas in this paper, which have much furthered their development, I should like to thank in particular Ingo Gildenhard (London), Karl Joachim H?lkeskamp (K?ln), Martin Jehne (Dresden), Susan Stephens, Alessandro Barchiesi and Walter Scheidel (Stanford), Frances Hickson Hahn (Santa Barbara), Cecilia Ames (C?rdoba), Tanja Itgenshorst (Bielefeld), Franz-Peter Mittag (Freiburg), Christoph Uehlinger (Z?rich), Adrian St?heli (Basel) and colleagues in Giessen and Erfurt. Hendrik Versnel's repeated criticism improved my argument and my English; I am grateful to Einar Thomassen for the documentation of the dissent remaining and his editorial care. I am grateful to the Max-Weber-Kolleg, Erfurt, for granting me a fellowship to start working on processes of rationaliza tion in the Roman republic. ?

In this context, the triumph constituted one of the media through which the Roman nobility could display military victories and their rewards to the Roman populace, thereby helping to ensure its future participation in aristocratically directed warfare.6 Hence the importance of the display of booty and military feats.7 It is one of the most interesting aspects of this system of commu nication that it furnished hardly any institutionalized outlet for the communication, and public recognition, of military defeats. The Romans did not even have a parallel to the Greek cult of those who died during a victorious campaign.8 The significance of the triumph 2 Versnel 1970; Bonfante Warren 1970, 1973. 3 Pietil?-Castren 1987; Orlin 1997.

In the funeral of a Roman noble, those of his ancestors who themselves had reached magistracies took part in the form of actors who, in addition to a wax-mask, wore the insignia and clothing of the highest office that the person they were impersonating had reached in life. Each mag istrate was accompanied by the appropriate number of lictors, and counting them was the only means by which one could differenti ate between former consuls, praetors, and aediles. All of them were dressed up in the toga praetexta, the white toga with a stripe of purple worn by Roman magistrates. For triumphatores, on the other hand, such arithmetic was unnecessary: their all-purple garment set them apart from the crowd of ordinary office-holders. But what are the semantics of the triumphator and the masks behind the political communication? Do we have to postulate a change from a dominantly religious meaning, i.e. that the triumphator was meant to be, or at least represent, Jupiter, and that dead ancestors rumbled through the city during the pompa funebris,xx to a domi nantly political one? For the triumph one could imagine that such a change occurred at the end of the fourth century bc, that is, dur ing the formative phase of the new nobility. In this case, the change in signification seems to have left the basic elements of the ritual unaltered. For the pompa imaginum, Harriet Flower argued for the transformation, at about the same period, of some unknown previous ritual into the known, primarily political event.12 Yet in 9 See Orlin 1997:66-73 for possible criteria and strategies. 10 Beard, North, Price 1998:143. 11 For the embodiment of dead ancestors, see explicitly Flower 1996:102. 12 Accepted by e.g., H?lscher 2001:204. Cf. H?lscher 1978:325, where he only mentions private honorary statues.</page><page sequence="4">254 J?rg R?pke order to save the hypothesis of a more religious earlier version of the aristocratic funeral and the cult of the ancestors (completely unknown to us), she has to argue that the entire complex of the funeral speech and the commemorative use of masks, with the stor age of the latter in the atrium, is a non-religious addition of that period.13 The only evidence for the postulated earlier stage is stat uary representations of (what are supposedly) ancestors. Fully con vincing parallels for that type of ancestor cult are lacking.14 This article offers a new hypothesis to understand the form and the significance of both rituals, by relating them to the practice of erecting honorific statues. The hypothesis is not supported by direct ancient evidence. Yet it better explains and historically contextual izes more of the odd features of the rituals (in particular the tri umph) than previous attempts to understand them. The basic thesis is that by the fourth century bc the display of private statues in public space ? not so much in view of the sheer quantity but because of the associations such statues evoked ? was seen as a threat to the capacity of the nobility to regulate its internal competition. 2. Jupiter or rexl What we know about the Roman triumph mostly stems from lit erary sources, from Livy onwards. The written sources on which these historians, antiquarians, or poets relied could not have gone further back than the end of the third century bc; usually they are later. The astonishingly few iconographie representations all come from the Principate.15 For this reason, any attempt at reconstruction of the ritual for earlier periods is necessarily antiquarian, that is, involves selecting individual elements, or combinations of ele ments, and interpreting them as dysfunctional survivals from a time 13 Flower 1996:341-43. See already H?lscher 1990:76. 14 Likewise, there are no convincing parallels to help account for the innova tion (Flower 1996:343-51). 15 K?nzl 1988 contains a useful presentation of the sources and a technical reconstruction.</page><page sequence="5">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 255 when they must have had greater pragmatic meaning and value. This heuristic procedure is operative in every study of the Repub lican triumph, including my own. How are we to envisage this ritual? On the most basic level, we are dealing with a procession of soldiers and booty that had its notional centre in the victorious general. The triumph was staged at the end of a campaign, after the return of the army, and was subject to the senate's approval. In legal terms, it involved the entry of a holder of imperium and of armed soldiers into the city proper. The cross ing of the boundary line was therefore emphasized.16 Booty and captives were presented to the populace; some of the prisoners might be put to death once the procession had reached the Capi toline hill. The ceremony was concluded with sacrifices to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus, probably corresponding to the vows made upon departure, which were addressed to the same deity.17 The whole procedure was supposed to honour the triumphing general. Riding in the centre of the procession, he wore a costume that the satirist Juvenal (later quoted by Servius) designated as tunica Iovis, "the tunic of Jupiter." Other paraphernalia, too, may have been designed to associate him with Jupiter: he wore a golden crown,18 held a sceptre topped by an eagle, and rode in a quadriga that imitated the one which was displayed on the roof of the Capitoline temple. Modern scholars tend to view the satirical verses sung by the par ticipants as apotropaic.19 Antiquarians in antiquity, however, referred some of the symbols used in the triumph to Etruria and the period of the kings. Together with the apparent connection to Jupiter, this antiquarian claim has set the agenda for two centuries of modern 16 Versnel 1970:132-63; R?pke 1990:226-30. 17 R?pke 1990:225. 18 Emphasized by Versnel 1970:74-77. 19 R?pke 1990:230-33. The interpretation is elaborated in detail by K?ves Zulauf 1972:122-49 in his analysis of the words which a slave, standing behind the triumphator, addressed to the general. A slave's monition to remember to be a human is already reported for Philip II of Maced?n (Aelian, Var. hist. 8.15).</page><page sequence="6">256 J?rg R?pke discussion, of whether the triumphator impersonated the god who was the embodiment of the entire res publica, namely Iuppiter Optimus Maximus, or rather revived the figure of the king. I need not repeat the arguments. It was H.S. Versnel who demon strated that the ostensible alternatives are not mutually exclusive, but two related facets of a religious ceremony known from the ancient Mediterranean world. According to Versnel, the triumph should be viewed as the modified form of a New Year's ritual during which the king confronted the highest god of the state and, in turn, became his embodiment or representative. The direct descendant of this festival is to be found on the Roman Ides of September, the epulum Iovis and the ludi Romani, opened by the pompa circensis that is so similiar to the triumph, especially in the role played by the leading magistrate. One of Versnel's most important arguments involves the element of the triumph from which the ceremony, which had no fixed date in the calendar, derives it name: the sol diers' cry (io) triumpe. This formulation is used in the archaic car men Arvale, a song that explicitly asked Mars and other deities for an epiphany and must stem from a cultic address to a deity from Asia minor, Dionysos, who was invited to appear with the cry thriambe.20 If Versnel's interpretation were entirely correct, I could stop here. There is, however, a serious problem with his solution: The historical Romans did not associate the appearance and acclamation of the triumphant general with his ascent to divine status, to say nothing of his transformation into Iuppiter ipse.21 As is well known, the Roman nobility frowned upon peers who laid claim to royal power or identified themselves with the highest god of the res publica. Some even got killed for doing so. In a nutshell: why did 20 See Varro, Ling. 6.68, who also already draws the connection with the tri umph. For the New Year festival, see Versnel 1970:1 Iff.; 201ff. His basic argu ment is accepted by Coarelli 1988:414ff., in his analysis of the archaic triumph. 21 This is admitted by Versnel 1970:1; cf. 92.</page><page sequence="7">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 257 most of the triumphators survive their triumph for longer than, say, Julius Caesar did? To concentrate on this problem is fair neither to Versnel nor to the complexities of the triumph, but it is crucial for any general interpretation of the ritual. In order to prepare the way for a new hypothesis, I want to invoke Victor Turner's principle of contextual meaning and start by addressing the relation between the triumph and the pompa circensis. The obvious parallels between the dress of the triumphator and of the magistrate who led the pompa circensis have led to several studies suggesting that there must have been a historical relationship between the two ceremonies.22 Whereas Versnel argued, by analogy with the triumphator, for the god-like status of the magistrate, and sought to establish an original meaning by analyzing the rituals of the Ides of September, I shall reverse the approach and concentrate on differences rather than similarities. First of all, Versnel's most convincing arguments in favour of the hypothesis that the triumphator impersonated Jupiter are based on elements of the costume that he shared with the leading magistrate of the pompa circensis. Leaving aside the dream of Augustus' father,23 two of the sources that refer to the ornatus Iovis (or sim ilarly) concern the triumphator, the other two refer to the magistrate.24 The same holds true of the golden crown {corona aurea or Etrusca), 22 Extensively discussed by Versnel 1970:101-15; 284-303. The treatment by Bernstein 1998:31-51 is unsatisfactory. 23 Suet. Aug. 94. 24 Triumphator: Liv. 10.7.10 (ornatus Iovis, no specific reference to the dress is detectable); Serv. Eel. 10.27 (quoting Iuvenalis in referring to the tunica palmata); pompa circensis: Juv. 10.36-43 (vestis); Tert. Cor. 13.1 (ab love insignes syntac tically separated from palmatis togis). No text explicitly states that the leader of the pompa in the ludi Romani wore the ornatus or uestis triumphalis. But every one rightly infers from other games (such as the ludi Apollinares) that this was also the case in the city's most prestigious games (see e.g., Versnel 1970:130).</page><page sequence="8">258 J?rg R?pke which is attested for both, triumphator and magistrate.25 But is there any reason to identify the magistrates in charge of the pompa with Jupiter?26 They were neither victorious nor were they perma nently honoured, either in their lifetime or after death, for having performed in this ritual role. They were ? and this needs to be stressed ? never acclaimed with io triumpe. There is one further argument that makes such an identification highly unlikely. The most important task of the magistrate was to round out a proces sion of gods to the circus. But Jupiter himself had already appeared in the pompa, in the form of a statue which was paraded along together with those of the other gods. So why should he appear twice? All this has important consequences for our interpretation of the triumphator. I submit that we can no longer regard the accou trements the triumphator shared with the magistrates leading other processions as evidence of his assimilation to Jupiter. The fact that the costume worn by the protagonists in these rituals recalled the (occasional?) dress of the Capitoline statue of Jupiter,27 does not imply that the Romans must have understood wearing the tunica palmata, the purple toga, or the gold crown (which was too heavy to be worn on the head and hence ? in both cases ? had to be held by a slave),28 to mean that Jupiter was being impersonated.29 25 Triumphator: Plin. Nat. 33.11; pompa circensis: Juv. 10.39-40; Tert. Cor. 13.1. 26 I accept Versnel's refutation of Mommsen's theory (accepted e.g. by Wissowa 1912:452) that originally the ludi were simply the latter part of a triumph. 27 I am convinced by Versnel's arguments (1970:73-74) for a strong interpreta tion of the relationship of the uestis with the statue of Jupiter. 28 Even if associating the processus consularis, too, Juvenal (n. 24) is concen trating on the game-leading praetor. 29 It should be noted that Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his detailed account of the pompa circensis (7.70-72), does not even mention the leading magistrate, whom he was obviously unable to fit into his Greek interpretation of the ritual. If the magistrate had been considered to represent Jupiter/Zeus, on the other hand, this would have been an easy task.</page><page sequence="9">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 259 The same is true of the sceptre surmounted by an eagle, which again was perhaps common to both ritual roles:30 it is too general a symbol of sovereignty to support the claim that the reference must be specifically to Jupiter.31 In view of the fact that this com bination of symbols could be used in different ludi, their meaning was most likely a generic one, and thus only loosely related to the specific contents of these rituals. The easiest way to interpret the costume is to see it as temporarily distinguishing an outstanding, extraordinary magistrate by means of regal symbols that, in other ritual contexts, were also used to honour Jupiter.32 There remain two differences between the triumphator and the magistrate. First, the triumphator rode in a quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses, whereas the magistrate was granted only a biga, drawn by two horses.33 The quadriga, being the more presti gious vehicle, elevated the triumphator above the normal magis trate. This might be taken to imply a reference to Jupiter, as well as to royal status, that is to say, to the highest degree of political power.34 Second, apart from the io triumpe, the triumphator was also coloured in red, which is not attested for the magistrate. Does this mean that the Romans saw Jupiter at the heart of the triumphal procession, as Versnel maintains?35 Or did they see something else? 30 See the previous note. 31 Thus Versnel 1970:77-78; cf. Waldner 2000:74-75. In the case of the tri umphator an additional association or rather contrast with the departure of the general and his use of a spear to open hostilities might be implied. See R?pke 1990:105-8. 32 Cf. Bonfante Warren 1970:59. 33 Plin. Nat. 34.20; for the archaeological evidence see Bernstein 1998:53-57. 34 Hence Versnel 1970:78 lays no stress on the quadriga. Given that his main interest is in the similarities of the two rituals which he takes to have developed from a common Etruscan prototype, it is perhaps unsurprising that he does not systematically explore the equally obvious differences between them. 35 Versnel 1970:78-82.</page><page sequence="10">260 J?rg R?pke 3. Parading a Living Statue The earliest and principal source for the colouring of the triumphator with red paint is Pliny the Elder: . . . Iovis ipsius simulacri faciem diebus festis minio inlini solitam tri umphantiumque corpora; sic Camillum triumphasse; hac religione etiam num addi in ung?enta cenae triumphalis et a censoribus in primis Iovem minian dam locar i. ... on feast-days, it was customary for the face of the statue of Jupiter him self to be painted with red-lead, likewise the body of triumphators. Camillus is said to have held a triumph thus painted. It was the same religious impulse that caused red-lead to be included among the substances employed at the tri umphal meal, and one of the censors' first duties is to let out the contract for painting Jupiter with red-lead.36 Now, why should the face of the statue of Jupiter be painted red? The answer has nothing to do with some proto-historic use of red colour, as Versnel suggests,37 but with material conditions. The statue would have been made of terracotta, like the Hercules fictilis of the Ara Maxima.38 This meant that, instead of the oil used in caring for statues of marble, the freshening up of the natural colour (as opposed to the parts that were specially painted) was done by using red paint.39 If this is correct, we need look no further for an explanation of why a Roman triumphator celebrated the ritual 36 Plin. Nat. 33.111f.; Serv. (auct.) Eel. 6.22; 10.27; Isid. Orig. 18,2,6; loan. Tzetzes, Epist. 97 (= Dio 6), Chil. 13.35-48 Leone. For the statue, see Plut. q. R. 98. 37 See Versnel 1970:78-81; tentatively Bonfante Warren 1970:54. 38 Plin. Nat. 35.157. For the site see Coarelli 1988:81. 39 Thus already Wissowa 1912:127 and Wunderlich 1925:63, drawing on Plin. Nat. 35.157 and 33.111-12. Despite the fact that the original inspiration for Wunderlich 's thesis came from Ludwig Deubner, her book tends to reject "prim itive" interpretation and to put emphasis on contemporary sources rather than ethnographic parallels, thus acknowledging the influence of her examiners Otto Kern and Georg Wissowa. For further references to the application of red colour to statues see Versnel 1970:79, n. 5 (implying different interpretations).</page><page sequence="11">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 261 painted red. He was covered in paint in imitation, not so much of Jupiter, as of a statue in terracotta.40 Being carried in a frozen pose in a chariot,41 with red colour applied to his body (i.e. the visible parts of his skin), he was meant to recall a terracotta statue. The ancient Romans watching a triumph saw a procession in which a "stand-in" terracotta statue was carried into the city. They saw nei ther the (temporary) return of the monarchy, nor Jupiter returning home or being carried in state. For Jupiter, as I have pointed out above, was a familiar figure on Roman streets. Everyone knew what he looked like: he was paraded around town on a litter, in the form of a statue or bust, or represented simply by his insignia, especially the thunder-bolt, which were conveyed in a tensa, a spe cial car that in olden times was drawn by children. No one would have confused him with a triumphator. 4. Statues for the Nobility Here, then, is the long form of my hypothesis: In the sole form known to the Romans of the late Republic and the Empire, the tri umph was an invention of the second half of the fourth century bc. It was a ritual that followed upon the (often difficult) decision of the senate to publicly acknowledge the martial achievements of a returning general. In the context of a growing fashion for display ing private statuary on public ground (described by Demosthenes as a contemporary Greek development),42 the Roman nobility as a whole tried to channel their desire for public prestige into a ritual that involved the publicly financed impersonation of a consciously archaic form of terracotta statues. And who could better act the part 40 Klearchos, tyrant of Herakleia in the middle of the fourth century bc, delib erately dressed himself as a statue of a god ? and painted his face red. See Versnel 1970:80, without the explanation that Klearchus wished to imitate a statue. 41 The arguments are given by K?ves-Zulauf 1972:140. 42 See Wallace-Hadrill 1990:151-53.</page><page sequence="12">262 J?rg R?pke of the temporary statue than the one who was honoured by it? The ritual would not compel the honorand to reject later real statuary. Forming part of the creation of, and the attempt to control, a monu mentalized commemorative culture,43 such a ritual would even increase the symbolic value of such statues and legitimize their public display. Sehlmeyer has recently observed that the earliest known hon orific statues, that is, statues put up for a living person, represented triumphators. He went on to postulate a regular connection between triumphs and honorific statues, Ehrenstatuen.44 The first recorded instance of this connection (for the year 338 bc) coincides with the first award of an honorific statue after the famous Camillus. After the successful completion of the war against Pedum, the final phase of the Latin wars 340-338 bc, the consuls L. Furius Camillus and C. Maenius "returned to Rome for the triumph decreed by the con sensus of all. To the triumph the honour was added that they receive equestrian statues in the Forum, a rare event at that period" (Romam ad destinatum omnium consensu triumphum decessere. additus triumpho honos, ut statuae ?questres eis, rara illa aetate res, in foro ponerentur).45 Livy stresses that the statues were equestrian, which implies a conceptual link between the simple award of a statue and the tri 43 See H?lscher 2001:187-88, who interprets the erection of a statue as the moment in time when current, functional knowledge was transformed into an ele ment of historical memory and thereby afforded new forms of recognition and prestige. See also H?lkeskamp 2000; Sehlmeyer 2000. 44 Sehlmeyer 1999:134. The connection had already been formulated less pre cisely by Lahusen 1983:67, who identified a statue given to M. Furius Camillus as a triumphator (over the Volsci and Aequi) after 389 bc. A discussion of these theses is lacking in H?lscher 2001:194-98, who dealt with honorific statues only as regards their placing along the route of the triumph. Already Wallace-Hadrill 1990:173 strongly argued against the assumption that statues were regularly granted by the Senate as a retrojection by authors writing during the Empire. 45 Liv. 8.13.9.</page><page sequence="13">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 263 umph. Did Livy's Augustan construct reflect the situation at the end of the fourth century? Anthropomorphic divine images had been frequent,46 but the same did not hold true for honorific statues of living people.47 There is no evidence that the practice became common in Greek states before the late fourth century. There are isolated stories of statues being put up in Rome before then. Whether these stories are trustworthy is controversial.48 H?lscher and Sehlmeyer are in agreement that, at Rome, the practice of dis playing statues in public began during the latter part of the fourth century, and led to a variety that greatly surpassed any known Greek models.49 There are other indications that new commemora tive practices emerged at the same time, such as the reorganization of the Forum initiated after 318 bc during the censorship of Maenius, who had previously, as noted already, been honoured by an equestrian statue and put up the so-called Maenianum, a build ing that featured a gallery for spectators.50 We should not assume, however, that this development was directed by the senate. It is more plausible to assume that private initiative was responsible for the pursuit of the attractive possibility to represent, multiply, and immortalize one's likeness in a form and size previously reserved for gods. The warrior of Capestrano might be seen as evidence of such experiments. The granting of triumphs by the end of the fourth century may be seen as a reaction to this development, an attempt to regulate, and bring under senatorial control, an increasingly common private practice which had only recently become fashionable. Attempts to circumscribe the 46 See Scheer 2000. 47 Plin. Nat. 34.17; H?lscher 1978:328; Sehlmeyer 1999:22. 48 See the criticism of H?lscher 2001: passim, of Sehlmeyer's rejection of every early statue that might threaten his account. Wallace-Hadrill 1990 too is sceptical. 49 Cf. H?lscher 2001:202. 50 Fest. 120 L; Varro, De vita p. R. fr. 72 Riposati; for the following course of action see H?lscher 1978:319; Coarelli 1985:87-119 (on the statues and the ruling on the faenatores); Flower 1996:341.</page><page sequence="14">264 J?rg R?pke award of statues displayed in public continued throughout the rest of Roman (and, indeed, European) history.51 The public ritual and the (mostly) private erection of a statue complemented one another. Booty may have been displayed both during the triumph and at the site of the statue. Maenius built the famous tribunal for the speak ers, the rostra, as location for this purpose, and some of the earliest attested statues represented the donator beside votive images of gods. The statue on the Capitol of the triumphator Spurius Carvilius, for example, stood close to a colossal image of Jupiter.52 In the triumph various media interacted in the representation of both the triumpha tor and booty, and this interaction is crucial to a proper understand ing of the ritual. If a late fourth-century date for the invention of the triumph can be maintained,53 the decision to represent the victor by means of a (fictitious) terracotta image of a type that was also in use in other 51 See below, and Tanner 2000:25ff. for the late Republic. 52 H?lscher 1978:322-24: "Beuteanathem"; Sehlmeyer 1999:113-16; more gen erally 128-29, 280. 53 Some comparatively reliable notices in our literary sources about the display of triumphal statues suggest the late fourth century as the terminus ante quern for the emergence of the triumph in its classical form. Other aspects that impinge upon the question involve the rather dimly known spread of honorific statues in the wider Mediterranean world of the fifth and fourth centuries and the largely simultaneous process of the formation of the new Roman nobility during the fourth century bc. Decisive steps seem to have been taken in the wake of the con stitutional changes marked by the so-called Sextian-Licinian laws, which are tra ditionally dated to 367 bc. Another line of argument is to exploit the similarities between triumph and pompa circensis. In conjunction with the admission of ple beians to the consulship in 367 bc (or thereabouts), the magistracy of the aediles curules was created, whose task it was to oversee the public games (see Bernstein 1998:58). As a result, the pompa celebrated during the ludi was no longer led by the supreme officer of the republic, but by lesser magistrates, who, for the time of the ritual only, assumed, by means of their clothing, the role of the "king's suc cessor," which had previously been performed by the consul. This change in rit ual procedure made the paraphernalia (and their semantics) free to be used in other rituals as well, as the immediate proliferation of games and the length of the</page><page sequence="15">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 265 ritual contexts, must have been deliberate. Its chief attraction was that it gave prominence to the ritual associations of the statue and thereby stressed the role of senatorial control, even if the later erec tion of a permanent statue, and the choice of material for it, left plenty of scope for further semantic distinctions and the adoption of current technical standards. Bronze became the minimum stan dard for honorific statues; gilding would represent an exceptional honour.54 A chryselephantine statue, on the other hand, indicated a definite transgression of the borderline between man and god. Such a statue was employed in the final honours for the dictator Caesar.55 Whereas pedestrian statues became regular for magistrates who died while serving on foreign embassies,56 a statue on horseback or even in a currus would be awarded to victorious magistrates or persons who had otherwise distinguished themselves in the service of the res publica. It should, however, again be stressed that it was not the statue but the accompanying public ritual that was central. Statues might be erected by all sorts of individuals or groups, but it was the performance of the public ritual that generated their sta tus, thus blurring the difference between public and private.57 5. Changes in the Ritual As Versnel was able to demonstrate, the honos of the triumph was never seen as an honour for the gods.58 Honouring the gods was the function of supplicationes, festivals of thanksgiving that were decreed "in the name of the victor" (as the later formula games seem to indicate. It is this semantic development that I claim as a termi nus post quern for the creation of the ritual of the triumph in its classical form. 54 See Cic. Phil. 5.41; Lahusen 1999. 55 Dio 43.14.3-7.

From a reli gious point of view, a strict separation of human and divine hon ours was necessary. While it was possible to deny a triumph to a general, the res publica could not dare to withhold what was due to the gods. Still, problems remain. After all, the ritual involved the deposition of the laurel wreath to Jupiter and the sacrifice of oxen on the Capitoline hill. In other words, we have to look for prece dents for and influences on the "enlightened" triumph other than the Hellenistic pompae on which it was so clearly modelled in its ostentatious display of booty.60 Rome's aristocracy engaged in "gentilician warfare" before the formation of the nobility. Only gradually, these wars became a matter for the entire commonwealth. As demonstrated in the recon struction of the history of the fetial rites, gentilician warfare was an enterprise carried out by individual families, perhaps for their per sonal enrichment, but it constituted at the same time a public problem.61 We may expect that earlier rites of return from military campaigns centred on the religious obligations of the leaders. They had to fulfil their vows and dedicate part of the booty to specific deities. The deities to which the dedication was made might have been chosen according to the individual preference of the general, fam ily tradition, or more general rules that are perhaps still reflected in the so-called leges regiae, the royal laws that defined the dedica tion of spolia opima, the spoils taken from the opposing leader.62 It is crucial to note that the Romans understood these regulations to require the victorious general to walk on his feet while carrying himself the spoils to be dedicated. Of equal importance is the fact 59 See R?pke 1990:215-17; in general Halkin 1953; Freyburger 1988; Hickson Hahn 2000. 60 For the latter point see H?lscher 1990:76. 61 R?pke 1990:97-124. 62 For the spolia opima see R?pke 1990:217-23; the (Varronian?) text of the lex regia is given by Fest. 204 L.

Rome was completely walled during the early republic, and entering the city with an armed group must have been restricted or even banned.63 Even if Augustan historiography associated with one another rit ual performances like the ovatio, the entering on foot, the trium phus in monte Albano (a triumph at the federal sanctuary that was celebrated for the first time in 231 bc and did not require the sen ate's consent), and the special form of dedication performed on the spoils of the hostile general, the spolia opima,64 the "real" triumph decreed by the senate differed from the Alban triumph as regards the location (the Roman Capitol instead of the federal sanctuary) and from the ovatio and the dedication of the spolia opima with respect to how the general moved during the ritual. He arrived standing on a chariot (rather than approaching on foot), and the red paint that, as I have suggested, assimilated the triumphator to a motionless statue, would have further highlighted the difference. Public accountability for the warfare and its gains was important since the successful conclusion of a campaign brought an enormous amount of material benefits to the victorious general and opened many options for prestigious ritual activities.65 The wide range of available ritual alternatives mentioned above, the amount of public statuary in public space, and the granting of often dubious triumphs give an indication of the small degree of success achieved by this form of control.66 The new processional ritual conformed with the growing impor tance of the publicity and visibility of Roman rituals.

Other rituals of thanksgiving, called suppli cationes, took place before the celebration of the triumph. The gen eral was also expected to discharge his personal obligations to the divinities afterwards, after the sacrifice to Jupiter that concluded the triumph and corresponded to the vow of departure. The name of the new ritual offers the best indicator of its focus: triumphus and triumphator derive from the exclamation triumpe, which, ini tially, must have been of mocking character, an outcry that accom panied the general standing still on his chariot, playing his own statue. We are dealing with a form of iambizein, which focused its satirizing thrust on the chief protagonist of the triumph, as it did in the pompa funebris with the important and rich deceased.68 The mockery of the soldiers was not "apotropaic," but rather formed a rite of reversal (and substantial public critique) in the presence of a superior who had enjoyed the right over the life and death of his inferiors and was now confined to immobility by the rite. 6. The Media of Representation The triumph was a serious matter. Many members of Rome's rul ing elite vied for the honour. The temporary appearance as a statue gave symbolic value to the permanent, too. To be permanently rep resented by a statue in a public place, a distinction previously by and large restricted to divinities, was as close to immortality as a Roman aristocrat could get.69 The prestige was immense, and the Romans developed considerable ingenuity to enhance the visual impact of individual statues even further. Some claimed attention by being 67 See Weinstock 1937:17-18. Favro 1994 stresses the enduring impact of the monumentalized processional route. 68 Dion.

If consuls leading a pompa triumphalis were honoured with quadrigae, why not give chariots to praetors and aediles leading a pompa circensisl It was, in any case, one's role in processional rites that functioned as the criterion of legitimacy for the public display of a statue.73 Still, Roman culture was first and foremost theatrical.74 Fre quently backed by public money, Roman generals of the middle and late Republic often used part of their military booty for build ing temples, but, as Orlin points out, nineteen out of twenty pre ferred to spend their booty on games. In contrast to temples, which were owned by deities, the generals themselves could preside over games.75 Likewise, it was the triumphal procession, rather than the statue, that made the largest impression upon the Roman populace. Even the emperors, at a time when most generals could no longer hope to celebrate their own triumph, did not object to a bronze statue at the centre of the ornamenta triumphalia.16 By using the 70 See H?lscher 1978:323-24 on monumentalization. 71 For republican arches see de Maria 1988:31-53.

The "temporary work of art" that consisted in the living statue of the triumphator was only one of a growing number of various improvised "temporary images," such as soldiers or captives arranged into battle scenes.78 It is here that we have to look for the Roman origins of triumphal painting.79 Henner von Hesberg used the term "temporary images" (tempor?re Bilder) to describe nearly contemporaneous practices at Hellenistic courts, such as are docu mented for us by Calixeinus' lengthy description of a festival given by Ptolemy II.80 It was this demonstrative element of the whole complex that drew most of the public interest and afforded a specific celebration the best chances to enter into the literary tradi tion, as is evinced by the lengthy descriptions that the extraordi nary triumphs of Aemilius Paulus or Pompey received.81 The further development of the triumph may be described in terms of increased theatralization: The ritual dress, which originally simply denoted unsurpassable authority,82 was elaborated into a tunica palmata and a toga pictaS3 and was used on further occasions and in statu ary representations. The triumph was only one of the occasions to 77 August. Gest. 4. See also Nickbakht 2005. 78 For the impression of the latter as living images see Brilliant 1999.

There is a discourse about statues in our literary sources, and, at least in the time of Cicero, this discourse was very important. His Or a?ones Verrianae bear witness to this. Statues of Marius were put up and removed; Verres' intentions and his prestige with the Sicilians can be measured by the way they dealt with statues. To a large extent, the discourse on Caesar's desire for deification is a discourse about statues. Earlier, once honorific statues had started to fill public space, memorial statues of historically important people, of kings and liberators, were added.85 Statues created complex mnemo topes.86 Damnationes memoriae tried to make sure that the persons annihilated disappeared from these mnemotopes, too.87 Statues were not just representations of individuals but conveyed messages relat ing to collective values, as is demonstrated by the generally stern mien of Roman portraits.88 Finally, when Roman coinage started to 84 See H?lscher 1978:349, who observes that the Roman concept of an histor ical event was focussed on ceremonial and representative fixations of political sit uations and ideals (". . . die zeremoniellen und repr?sentativen Besiegelungen politischer Zust?nde und Ideale zum Inhalt hat"). 85 H?lscher 1978:349; Sehlmeyer 1999:67-103. 86 H?lscher 2001. 87 As regulated in the Senatusconsultum de Gn.

Only one group of Romans is formally equivalent to triumphators, the virgines Vestales. Both share the right to be buried within the boundaries of the city,90 together they are the earliest groups in Roman histori cal memory to receive public statues.91 When the honouring of Livia in 9 bc firmly turned the rare practice of giving statues to women into a prerogative of the imperial domus, regulations were made that not only associated her with the Vestals, but had direct connections with the triumph as well. She was credited with omina that predicted her giving birth to future triumphatores and even organized a banquet for the women of Rome, parallel to Tiberius' triumphal banquet following his ovatio (on behalf of Drusus).92 Just like a triumphator's, Livia's right to a public statue was beyond discussion. 7. Pompa imaginum A further mode of representing honorific statues in republican Rome has to be considered. It is possible to conceive of the entourage of dead ancestors, represented by actors wearing masks, which made Tanner 2000 has made a case for placing the development of the veristic style in the 2nd century bc within the institutional context of Roman patronage, especially as extended onto foreign citizens. 89 RRC 242/1; 263/1 and later.

(We do not know whether every aedile of the late republic received the statue that was his due during his lifetime, but I sus pect they did.) Flower has argued that those aspects of the ritual that involved the wearing of masks and the laudatory speech cannot be older than the end of the fourth century. Termini post quern (or coequal processes) are the restructuring of the Forum (the place where the laudatio funebris was delivered) and the emergence of the individ ualistic statuary portraits.93 Flower, however, had to leave open a crucial problem that also figures largely in all the older studies on the history of the masks. What are the ritual and artificial ante cedents of those masks that ? according to the classical description by Polybios ? tried to portray the dead ancestors as realistically as possible?94 The traditional explanation, which invoked magic rit uals applied to the dead and posited a connection to a death mask (still maintained by Heinrich Drerup in 1980), has by now been soundly refuted on the grounds of archaeological and literary evi dence.95 But the problem disappears if one applies the concept of "temporary images" to the ritual. If the masks were intended to copy existing honorific statues or fictive memorial ones (as the line of ancestors grew longer and 93 Flower 1996:341-43. If my thesis is tenable, H?lscher's claim (2001:205) that public gentilician representation in the form of statues did not start before the middle of the second century bc will have to be modified, though he stresses the importance of ritual "performances" of statues.

Grimes 1995:80).</page><page sequence="24">274 J?rg R?pke longer due to late republican competition and historical fiction),96 one need no longer worry about the origin of the masks. They were either historical copies of models used for the production of the statues themselves or easily copied from the actual statue. Hence the proliferation of masks of common ancestors that would be used in many agnate and cognate families at the same time was no tech nical problem. At the same time, the known statues would have set standards of individuality that had to be strived for: "likeness," not fancy, was a necessity. Recent research has shown the convergence of the range of masks and statues, as far as the recipients are concerned. This con vergence can no longer be explained by a postulated ius imaginum that would regulate both cases in like manner.97 The primary factor was the proliferation of statues, finally reaching down to aediles. Despite the attempts of Flower to play down all the other forms of portraits,98 already H?lscher, who thought of "historical" masks and statues as parallel developments, demonstrated that ancient dis course was much more concerned with statues than with ancestor masks.99 The pompa imaginum and the laudado funebris must be seen as attempts to reactualize and extend the impression made by the honorific statues with a focus on a family. By such means as cheap masks, actors and oratory the family ensemble could be rep resented and displayed, and defined according to needs.100 Here, 96 See Dondin-Payre 1990:58-59, 66-72 for the creation of fictive genealogies. Such fictions did enhance the normative value of genealogy, as is rightly noticed by H?lkeskamp 1996:322. 97 Flower 1996:53-56, against Lahusen 1983:113-27; Lahusen 1985. 98 Flower 1996:70ff. 99 H?lscher 1978:325. However, the argument should be built on sources like Ennius (e.g. Scipio = var. 1-2 Vahlen; cf. Liv. 38.56.22; Val. Max. 4.1.6) or Cicero, rather than on Pliny's book dealing with metals (naturalis historia 34,15ff.); cf. Drerup 1980:127. 100 For the constructive character of the Roman gens and familia see Corbier 1990; Dondin-Payre 1990.</page><page sequence="25">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 275 again, Greek temporary images might have been a source of inspi ration, festival practices that delighted in the visualization of groups of people, perhaps even genealogies.101 In contrast to the Hellenistic festivals centred on courts that were locally fixed and would therefore stress the arrangement of real statuary, the Roman practice, as part of the competition within a polyfocal aristocracy, laid stress on rituals in public space and on actors performing stat ues, a feature also popular in the festivals of early Hellenism.102 None of this excludes statuary programs in private villas, shown in the context of private festivals. The presentation of masks and tituli to clients and visitors in the atrium of the house of a Roman noble attests to the interest in demonstrating a complete lineage ? and to the limits of this interest. More impressive arrangements than closed cupboards and depicted genealogical trees were possi ble!103 Not masks and cupboards (even if they were better pre served) dominate the archaeological records from Roman villas, but fully fledged portrait busts and statuary.104 It is only by being placed in a spectacular location that a mask could be endowed with 101 Hesberg 1989. A genealogical row of figures might have been part of the tomb of Nikokreon, king of Salamis, from the end of the fourth century bc (ibid., 67-68). 102 Hesberg 1989:77. This is one of the elements that argue ? against Sehlmeyer 1999 ? for a priority of the Greek form, and hence for a process of reception like those shown for a wide range of elements by H?lscher 1990. What is important is not the temporal priority of invention, but the different use to which these inventions (and even their producers, Greek artists, see Gruen 1992:140) are put. Drerup, too, thought he had identified pure Roman forms and institutions in the use of the wax mask (1980:120). For the Greek use of masks, see e.g. Carter 1987; Frontisi-Ducroux 1991; for other Roman practices, see Meuli 1955. 103 The "Kastengr?ber" of freedmen, showing reliefs of persons as if looking out of a window ("Fenstergucker") are interpreted by Lahusen 1985:283-84 as an even more economic form of presentation. 104 See Niquet 2000:26-27, for the 4th century ad. In neither case, however, do we detect traces of ancestor cult, as I was reminded by Andreas Bendlin.</page><page sequence="26">276 J?rg R?pke permanent importance: The deposition of the mask of Scipio Africanus in the temple of Jupiter105 was a spectacular act of this kind, mak ing its impression not by virtue of the inherent quality of the mask but by the contrast between the public location and the intimate, domestic object.106 My thesis has several further advantages. The ancient Romans were strikingly preoccupied with, and careful in, their dealings with spirits and shadows, as evinced by such festivals as the Parentalia, the Lemuria, or the kalendae fabariae.101 This preoccupation would seem to make their nonchalance about the appearance of dead ancestors during the pompa funebris strikingly odd. But if the actors who represented these ancestors by wearing masks are seen as representing statues, rather than dead persons, the apparent odd ity that the Romans did not seem to worry about dead people rum bling through their city disappears. A procession formed by living statues was much more comfortable to deal with. By the time of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but probably much earlier, perhaps right from the start, the satyrical figures of the pompa circensis, too, formed part of, or had entered into, the funeral exsequiae.xos Only by the time of Principate, as is attested for the funeral of Vespasian (though qualified as mos), did the actors no longer just 105 Val. Max. 8.15.1-2.; App. Iber. 89. 106 Flower 1996:48-51. 107 See Toynbee 1971:33-42 and, concentrating on the funerary rites, Deschamps 1995; cf. Bremmer 1994 and Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 for Greece, Briquel 1987 for Etruria. This problem, first articulated in a discussion of a paper given by Egon Flaig at the university of T?bingen, was in fact the beginning of my thinking about Roman masks and the red face of the triumphator. Kierdorf 1991:84-85 solves the problem by stressing the close relationship between the liv ing and the dead in Rome, shown in particular by the pompa imaginum. Dupont 1987:171 had offered a solution by maintaining that the masks represented the liv ing part of the dead, without any defilement; she was followed in principle by Belayche 1995:160. 108 Dion. H. 7.72.13.</page><page sequence="27">Triumphator and Ancestor Rituals 277 imitate motionless statues carried in chariots (as in the time of Polybios),109 but interacted with the spectators. Having heard that the pompa cost ten million sesterces, Favor, imitating Vespasian in words and deeds, exclaimed: "Give me just one hundred thousand and throw me into the Tiber!"110 Such sums were necessary not just to pay for the actors, but to attract the necessary public by the promise of a subsequent lavish banquet and mu?era, gladiatorial shows.111 The temporary medium of the ritual had its prize, too. And yet, there is an important dif ference as regards the triumph. Whereas the triumph as a ritual was depicted and carved into reliefs, not a single instance of an ancient representation of the pompa imaginum is known.112 This observa tion may have a chronological explanation: In the heyday of pre served relief, i.e. the Principate, the pompa imaginum had already fallen into disuse.113 But I would suggest that there is another rea son as well. Whereas the triumph was an argument in itself, the funerary procession by and large displayed only existent statuary. Not the ritual but the number of statues was to be multiplied ? again the aftermath of the funus is a typical instigation for the cre ation of public honorific statues for the defunct immediately after wards.114 Finally, one further difference should be pointed out. The triumph normally presupposed a senatorial decision recognizing the legitimacy of the general's claim to be honoured. Such formalized control is lacking for the funus.

The documentation of such detailed constructions and claims was better left to historiography than reliefs. 8. Statues and Immortality In the course of this paper, two important Roman rituals which supposedly featured magical or, rather, anachronistic religious ele ments, have emerged as historical creations that reflect forms of public honouring which were newly introduced at the end of the fourth century and involved the setting up of terracotta, and, soon afterwards, bronze statues in public space.116 Why, however, were statues so important as to attract such a degree of ritualization? We do not know anything about Roman attitudes in the fourth century bc to images of deities. As the Romans shared the combi nation of temple and cult image, the combination of sacrifices at an altar outside and presentation of food inside a temple, in front of a cult statue, and as they shared the cultivation of sanctuaries, altars and sacred groves with many Mediterranean cultures, we could presuppose that their attitude towards images did not differ in principle from what we know about Greek attitudes. Those were far ranging and varying according to situation. The identification of image and deity in the address of a statue probably coexisted with a clear conception of statues as human artefacts.117 An analogous ambivalence applied to statuary representations of humans. In his discourse about statues in his speeches against Verres, Cicero cred ited contemporary Greeks with the sentiment that statues of humans had a divine dimension.118 Unlike Cicero, we have no rea 115 See H?lkeskamp 1996:322 for examples, such as Cic.

Thus, the preoccupation, even obsession with a statue is understandable. Honorific statues were more than "Symbole nobilit?ren Standes bewu?tseins," symbols of self-esteem of the nobility.122 The mech anisms involved continued into and throughout the Principate, they were part of a history that led to (and survived) Byzantine icono clasm. The development of the triumph under Augustus offers a splendid illustration. The first princeps monopolized the triumph for the emperor and members of the imperial family.123 A similar development can be detected as regards the pompae f?nebres, which acquired a new orientation directed towards the imperial household.124 In both cases, the emperor put his stamp on large the atrical rituals.125 uidissem, propterea quod apud omnis Graecos hic mos est, ut honorem hominibus habitum in monumentis eius modi non nulla religione deorum consecran arbitrentur. 119 See Gregory 1994:98-99; Stewart 2003:31-33. Orlin's characterization (1997:71-72) of statues as a non-religious alternative to victory rituals is mis leading. 120 See Tanner 2000 and Niquet 2000:77 for many literary and epigraphic instances connecting the honour of a statue with notions of eternity. Texts would offer even more possibilities (see Feldherr 2000), but they would not be as acces sible to the general public as poets usually supposed. 121 Stewart 2003:92, 102. 122 Thus Sehlmeyer 1999:278-84. 123 Barini 1952; R?pke 1990:208, 234. 124 Lahusen 1985:267 with an argument e silentio that has to be modified on the basis of the Senatusconsultum de Cn.

Hickson 1991:129-30 showed the triumph to be an indi cator of possible successors.</page><page sequence="30">280 J?rg R?pke Augustus, however, did not triumph after establishing his monopoly. The permanence of the victorious power, its felicity, could no longer be adequately expressed by setting up new statues among the mass of existing ones. For the use of an inflationary medium, the context was decisive: At least for Rome, small stat uettes of Augustus between genii or lares were more important than another life-size statue in the Forum.126 Triumphal practices were concentrated on the new temple of Mars Ultor, where tri umphal imagery abounded.127 In the long run, the triumph lost its processional character and was concentrated in the circus.128 Coins and the inscriptional copies of the Res gestae demonstrate the importance of representation in other media from Augustus onwards. The meaning of the triumph changed. In his Res gestae, Augus tus described himself as having triumphed ovans, thus defining an important alternative to the triumph, the ovatio, as a mere vari ant.129 The triumph had become an urban form of control of the appropriation of victory, rivalling the monumental tropaia built in the provinces.130 The monopoly on victory implied a monopoly on triumphs. Even the most prestigious statues had to be set up with out preceding processions. The coll?gial conception of rulership was reflected in the erection of groups of statues, irrespective of actual participation in a military campaign.131 For their statues, the emperors could be displayed in a seated position used in the pro cession (on a four-wheeled vehicle, a carpentum).132 This, however, points to remaining associations. Trajan, for instance, even cele 126 For the reform of the compital cult see Fraschetti 1990, esp. 331-60; R?pke 1998. 127 Hickson 1991:133-34; for details see Siebler 1988; Ganzert 1988. 128 McCormick 1987:99-100. 129 August.

The governor Olbianus, the spatharii, the cubicularii, and also the silentiarii, forming an escort with white candles, all dressed in white garments, brought it raised on a carriage ... it was revered as the Tyche of the city by all, including the army. And finally it was raised on a pillar in the presence of the priest and the procession, and everyone cried out the Kyrie eleison a hundred times.135 In a Christian city, io triumpe had to be dropped.
