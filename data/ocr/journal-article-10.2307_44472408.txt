Wille Brigham Young Univ. ABSTRACT Recently obtained force-deflection information for the frontal, zygomatic and maxillary regions of the human cadaver head and the Hybrid III AID head indicates need for a redesigned Anthropomorphic Test IXimmy (ATD) face. A prototype, deformable, load-sensing face (DLSF) was designed, with human-like- force-deflection compliant materials. The face was divided into six load sensing segments. The force level and impact location as a function of time can be determined for each segment, as well as for a selected set of segments and the whole face. The prototype face underwent preliminary testing for comparison with available cadaver data. TO FAMILIARIZE THE READER WITH THE WORK that has been done thus far, a review of the latest government accepted anthropomorphic head design (Hybrid III) will be conducted. In addition, early facial impact work done by Le Fort, and recent facial impact work done by Allsop will be reviewed. Finally, there will be a general review of the current automotive crash test environment to establish impact exposure levels seen by anthropomorphic dummies today. HYBRID III DUMMY Auto safety researchers use anthropomorphic dummies to simulate the human occupant for an array of automotive crash tests. Over the years the dummy has been improved to more closely simulate its human counterpart. Improvements to the face and head are of current concern to improve biofidelity and enable the researcher to reduce occupant exposure to facial injuries. A major function of the anthropomorphic dummy is to insure that occupant protection complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Compliance tests are designated by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards under Part 571 of the Code of Federal Regulations [4]. A vehicle sold in the United States must comply with Part 571 before the manufacturer is allowed to sell the vehicle. To insure repeatability of such tests from manufacturer to manufacturer, the United States Federal Government has established design criteria for the ATD head as well as other components of the anthropomorphic dummy. The Hybrid III head is the latest Federally-accepted head design. This anthropomorphic test dummy head is constructed of' a cast skull of 356 aluminum with a T6 heat treatment. A vinyl skin is placed over the skull to improve biomechanical fidelity and repeatability of head response to hard-surface impacts. This head was based upon a General Motors Corporation mid 1970 1 s design [9,20,31]. Head mass, center of gravity location, sagittal (see figure 1) mass moment of inertia and other head geometries were established by Hubbard et al [24], and are incorporated into the Federal Government design criteria.

The thickness of the vinyl skin in the frontal region is dictated by required hard- surface impact response. Part 572 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains a complete list of the design and calibration requirements for the anthropomorphic dummy [6] . One such requirement involves a drop test of the ATD head. The head is dropped 14.8 inches onto a flat rigid plate. The head is suspended so that the lowest point on the forehead is 0.5 inches below the lowest point on the dummy1 s nose when the midsagittal plane is vertical . When dropped, the head's peak resultant center of gravity acceleration must be between 225 g's and 275 g's. To meet this requirement the thickness of the vinyl skin is critical. If the skin were thicker the resultant acceleration would be too low. If the skin were thinner the resultant acceleration would be too high. The drop height and resultant acceleration were established through cadaver testing [8,10,11,15-17]. The current Hybrid III head uses approximately the same thickness of skin over the entire surface of the face and forehead. Cadaver testing indicates that the facial region below the forehead is not as rigid as the forehead itself [1,12-14,18,24,26,28,29]. This indicated the need to design a face with a modified skin and/or under structure to provide representative biofidelity to the face and head for hard-surface or other varieties of impacts. CADAVER STUDIES FACIAL FRACTURE CIASSIFICATION - Probably the earliest recorded investigative work to trauma of the face and skull bones was performed by Le Fort in 1900 [21]. He reported his observations describing types of bone fractures produced in human cadaver skulls as a consequence of impacts to the face. He performed approximately 40 tests dealing with the effects of varying location and direction of load application to the facial skeletal structure. This series of experiments and subsequent work by Le Fort provided the basis for mapping lines of fracture (see figure 3) that most commonly resulted fron blunt impact trauma to the face. This mapping of fracture lines in the face has been named the Ie Fort classification of maxillary fractures. This nomenclature is still being utilized^ today within the medical profession to describe and classify facial fractures. Figure 3 - Fractures of the maxilla, 1. Le Fort I (transverse fracture) . 2 . Le Fort II (pyramidal fracture) . 3. Le Fort III (craniofacial disjunction) . (From Dingman and Natvig. [7]) CYLINDRICAL FACIAL IMPACTS - In 1988 Douglas "L" Allsop, et al. [1] performed a series of facial impacts to compare force- deflection characteristics of human cadaver faces with those of the Hybrid III Dummy Head. Two major objectives were addressed. The first was to identify large-deformation responses for the human skull. The second was to enhance facial impact data for small-diameter cylindrical facial impacts. The Allsop tests involved a series of cadaver facial impacts with a semi-circular cylinder 20 millimeter in diameter and 230 millimeter in length. The impactor consisted of an aluminum structure designed to sense impact loads. Penetration of the impactor into the impacted surface was measured and recorded through the use of a linear string pot attached to the impactor. Impacts were conducted from various drop heights on the frontal bone as well 1635</page><page sequence="3">as the zygomatic, maxillary and mandibular regions of the face. Allscp calculated an average stiffness for the frontal, zygomatic and maxillary regions of approximately 1000, 150, and 100 newtons per millimeter respectively. For each of the impacts the displacement at fracture was less than or equal to 3.0 cm. Comparisons were made between the stiffness of the Hybrid III face and the human cadaver. For the zygomatic and maxillary regions of the face, the Hybrid III face exhibited a stiffness several times that of the human face. TESTING ENVIRONMENT The automotive industry has now advanced its concern over safety of vehicle occupants. Over the last 20 years the automotive industry has done much to reduce the exposure of the head to injury through restraint usage. Three-point seat belts have been the prominent restraint system deployed into the consumer market. Recently the automotive industry has been required to installi into their production cars either a passive belt restraint system or a driver airbag supplemental system [5]. Questions have arisen as to what injuries might occur to the face when exposed to the deployment of an airbag system. In addition, even with restraint usage, faciali fractures are still occurring because of facial impact with steering wheel assemblies. To help the industry reduce facial fractures, the designer needs to be able to assess loads to the face during facial impact with various elements within the passenger compartment. Force-sensing plates as well as a deformable material installed beneath the skin could allcw the AID head to accurately reflect facial impact loads. With information regarding allowable facial impact loads, the designer would be able to assess the injury reduction of any current or future designs related to either an airbag system or other interior vehicle components. OBJECTIVES The objectives were to first develop a compliant insert placed behind the Hybrid III dummy facial skin capable of simulating the force/displacement characteristics of the human face as published by Allscp, and second, to design, construct, and test an anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) head capable of measuring facial impact loads and their locations. COMPLIANT INSERT - The compliant insert was to be designed, constructed, and tested in combination with the Hybrid III vinyl skin, to be capable of reproducing the biamechanical characteristics of the human cadaver face. Magnitudes of impact crush stiffness, linearity of the stiffness curve, and plasticity of the insert material were to be compared directly with Allscp1 s work. The stiffness of the insert within the linear region for the zygomatic and maxilla regions was to fall within ±10 percent of the values published by Allsop. No changes were to affect compliancy within the frontal region. Nominal insert thickness was set at one inch to accomplish a combined minimum insert/vinyl skin thickness of 3 cm. The insert material which best compared with the es- tablished design characteristics was to be placed within a modified head to simulate human facial impacts with hard-surfaces and vehicle- interiors. The stiffness of the mandible region was set the same as the maxilla region. No stiffness specifications had been established for the mandible region of the face, yet an inclusion was made for an impact plate in this area. Because the mandible or jaw bone is hinged, it has been difficult to establish a force/crush characteristic for that region of the face. Currently no reliable force/crush characterization has been established for the mandible structure. This exists mainly because the load to the mandible structure is highly a function of the geometry of the impact. A frontal blew to the mandible causes the mouth to open and displacement is increased during loading. If the impact is anterior to posterior with an inferior to superior component, then the mandible position relative to the head is maintained and a smaller load is required to fracture. This impact variability complicates the establishment of the biomechanical properties of this structure. A mandible sensor was included due to its close proximity to the maxilla, which would give valuable information assuming that impact were slightly superior to the mandible. The stiffness of the insert in the mandible region was chosen to be the same as that of the maxilla region. LOAD SENSING SYSTEM - A load sensing system was to be designed, constructed, and tested capable of measuring the impact loads to the face during impacts with interior surfaces of the vehicle. The impact plates were to be configured to coincide with Le Fort lines of fracture. The load sensors for the plates were to be mounted so impact alignment up to 30 degrees away from the frontal axis would be measured by the impact plates without measured attenuation greater than one minus the cosine of the impact angle. load sensors for the plates were to be configured so the impact load centroid could be triangulated within each plate. Construction of the head was to maintain the mass and geometry design criteria for the current Hybrid III dummy head as listed in Table 1. Review of the Allsop data indicated the cadaver impact data fell within a frequency range of 20 to 500 Hertz [1]. The impact plates were then required to operate within a frequency range from 10 to 5000 Hertz. The higher limit allowed for low-pass, pre-sample filtering to eliminate unwanted aliasing from digital sampling by the instrumentation. 1636</page><page sequence="4">APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM COMPLIANT INSERIS - Allsop, et al, established the desired force/crush characteristics of the face. The force/crush stiffnesses were 10,000, 1500, and 1000 newtons per centimeter for the frontal, zygomatic and maxillary regions respectfully [1]. Various materials were subject to impact tests using the same drop- tower apparatus as used by Allsop. Ihe candidate materials included 35 and 55 durometer rubber, packing material, Ensolite, neoprene, Sorbothane, butyl rubber and chlorbbu- tyl rubber. Ihe materials were grouped according to their ability to self-restore for use with repeated impacts. lhe study unsuccessfully began with self-restoring materials in an attempt to discover an insert material capable of repeated impacts. Ihe study then turned to single- impact crushable materials. This material group was constructed of polyurethane of various densities and geometry. A final selected material duplicated the stiffnesses as desired for each of the facial regions. Final testing was done with the Hybrid III vinyl skin in place to insure that the skin/ insert combination was capable of reproducing correct stiffnesses. Ihe insert and vinyl skin combination were impacted by the same impactor used by Allsop. Impact forces and dis- placements were recorded and compared against the cadaver data acquired by Allsop. A comparison was made of: 1) force/crush stiffness, 2) linearity of the crush curve up to fracture load and 3) plasticity of the impacted material. HEAD DESIGN - Rather than designing a completely new head, the decision was made to modify an existing Hybrid III head to accomplish the design objectives because the current Hybrid III head is accepted for Federal Automobile Compliance Testing. It is also readily accepted within the automotive community. For the proposed prototype design, modifiçation of an existing head also eliminated unnecessary expense associated with design of a completely new structure. INSTRUMENTED SEGMENTED SKULL - Ihe six facial impact plates were located to coincide with the Le Fort lines of fracture. A schematic sketch of the impact plates is shown in Figure 4. It was composed of six plates. All six plates were instrumented with force transducers. Ihe six instrumented plates were: a) superior maxilla and nasal, b) inferior maxilla, c) mandible, d) the left and right zygoma/sub orbital ridge and e) frontal. Ihe design incorporated off-the-shelf, or commercially available transducers, mounted so as to be easily replaceable. Ihe transducers were to be capable of measuring necessary loads while being sufficiently small to fit within the limited physical dimensions of the dummy head. Suitable transducers were found to be piezoelectric load washers designed by Kistler Instrument Corporation. SS' Frontal ! Left Zygomatic Nasa I ' / Max ilia V ~ļ Mand i b I e Figure 4 - Schematic of Impact Plates. Ihe force-instrumented segments were each backed up by three load washers. A total of eighteen load washers were used for the instrumentation of the entire facial area. Ihe load washers were mounted such that impacts would not cause the skull facial plates to pivot, tilting away from the skull under structure . Sensor electrical connections and leads were oriented to avoid damage by impacts associated with direct contact or inertial shocks. Means of attachment to the Hybrid III six axis dummy neck was provided in the design. Five of the facial plates were made of graphite-fiber-reinforced epoxy resin. Ihe sixth or fronted piece was constructed from the existing aluminum skull. lhe additional five impact plates were required to be both light as well as strong. Heavier materials would not allow the design to remain within the weight criteria. Weaker materials would not be able to survive impact forces. INSTRUMENTATION Impact testing on sample compliant facial inserts used the same drop tower Allsop used during his testing (see figure 5) . Ihe impactor contained eighteen miniature force transducers with piezoelectric sensors mounted to a solid aluminum block (see figure 6) . Ihe impactor was mounted to a falling mass with a combined total weight of 25 pounds. Ihe impactor force trans- ducers were made by sandwiching piezoelectric plastic film between parallel aluminum and steel surfaces. Ihe forces were transmitted to the sensors by steel rods connected to eighteen semi-cylindrical disks lined up side by side creating a semi-cylindrical impact surface 20 mm in . diameter and 230 mm in length. Ihe masses between the impacted specimen and the load cells were kept low (17.6 gm) in order to allow accurate description of the force/time curves of the impacted sample compliant inserts. This mass produced a transducer with a frequency range up to 20,000 Hertz. All instrumentation on the drop tower was conditioned and sampled digitally at a rate of 5000 hertz through a TransEra MDAS 7000. Early impact tests were conducted using pre-sairple, low-pass filters on the impactor force sensors. 1637</page><page sequence="5">Figure 5 - Test Setup. / A LŤ~~~tJ • PI«zo-EI«ctrlc ' : i Tr.FříÍÍ„r»-^r l.p0Ct»d RtL^-St..!

All data fron the TransEra was transferred for temporary storage to a PC-type computer. The data was later transferred to a Hewlett-Packard computer where calibration constants were applied and the data plotted. POLÏURETHANE FOAM RAW MATERIAL - The single-impact, non- restoring-material insert was constructed of Polyurethane foam. While always consisting of Polyurethane foam, various foam densities and geometric configurations were tested. Three densities of polyurethane foam were initially obtained from General Plastics Manufacturing Company of Tacoma, Washington. A 4 foot by 8 foot by 1 inch thick sheet of each types FR3704, FR3705 and FR3706 were ordered for testing. Sample inserts were cut from the sheets and hand contoured to duplicate the exterior contour of the aluminum Hybrid III dummy skull. Impacts were conducted in the maxillary region in combination with the Hybrid III vinyl skin (see figure 7) . Figure 8 shews the results of those tests. The stiffness of each materiell was linear through the major portion of impact compression. The FR3705 and FR3706 materials showed a roll off in stiffness during the final stages of compression. In particular, FR3704 exhibited a much greater stiffness during final compression. This was associated with full compaction of the foam' material and bottoming out onto the test platform by the impactor. Each of the materials exhibited plastic impact hysteresis. The stiffnesses of these materials were ~1100 N/cm, ~2600 N/cm and ~4500 N/cm for FR3704, FR3705 and FR3706 samples respectively. Figure 7 - Compi iant-Insert/Hybrid III - Skin Impact Test Setup. Figure 8 - Force/Displacement Polyurethane Foam - Multiple Material Densities - Maxilla Impacts. DRILLED INSERTS - A comparison was made with the tests from figure 8 against the design criteria established by Allsop. This comparison indicated that the stiffnesses of FR3705 and FR3706 were too high for the maxillary and zygomatic regions. FR3704 was ideal for the maxillary region, but too soft for the zygomatic region. Contact was made with the material manufacturer to determine if they could produce material at densities between 4 and 5 pounds per cubic foot. They indicated that the 1638</page><page sequence="6">manufacturing process did not allow a tighter tolerance control during production. Nothing could be done to increase the stiffness of FR3704 to conform with the stiffness requirements for the zygomatic impacts. However, the stiffness of FR3705 could be reduced by drilling holes into the material to reduce its density. In fact, the possibility was considered that FR3705 could be drilled with two different size holes to obtain the required stiffness for the maxillary and zygomatic regions of the face. This would allow the compliant insert for the face to be constructed fron one piece rather than two. The plan, therefore, was to reduce the stiffness of FR3705 by drilling holes into the material. Volume reduction was accomplished by drilling holes using a 0.4" equalateral traingular hole pattern (see figure 9) . © © o Figure 9 - Volume Reduction Hole Rattern. ZYGOMATIC DRILL SIZE - Sample inserts were machined on a numerical mill programmed to match the contour of the Hybrid III skull (see figure 10) . A series of tests were performed to determine the drill size required for the zygomatic region. A drill size 'H1 (0.266 inches) yielded a stiffness of ~1500 N/cm. A series of two additional tests were then performed as depicted in Figure 11, all used 'H' -size drilled holes to show repeatability of the material. ^/7 ;;0.875" . 4.250" , € I I o o o o o'o o o o o' T /oooooòoooocA JOOOO OlO o o o o c -*■ OOOOOÒOOOOO 0 810" poooo o'o O O O O Ç ļooooodioooooļ V O O O O OlO o o o o / 7OOOOÓOOOOÇ A Q-TKII p o o o o'o o o o qr ^.0/0 Xooooòooo o] _ V o o o Ol o o o o Y _ "TT nnn„ 000 booooooo c • • nnn„ 000 'o o o o'o 000/ 'o 000000/ 'o o 0.0 00c h o o 6 o o r t ļ U À U- I 0.875" 2. 125" Figure 10 - Milled Contoured Compliant Facial Insert.

INSERT MATERIAL SEEECTTCN Various materials, self-restoring and non- self restoring, were tested to evaluate their ability to meet the required design criteria. The self restoring materials had the advantage of being able to be used for repeated tests. Yet, the non-linear stiffness and the elastic impact hysteresis negated selection of these materials. Even though the polyurethane foam may only be used for one impact, this material exhibited the correct stiffness characteristics for both the zygomatic and maxillary regions 1639</page><page sequence="7">when modified by drilling. lhe material also exhibited plastic impact qualities comparable with the Allsop data. Modifications were made to a Hybrid III head to incorporate 1) the compliant insert and 2) impact load sensing plates. Initial geometry review of the current Hybrid III head was necessary to determine the available anterior head .space for modification, lhe load sensing plate geometry and the load washer mounting assembly design were established. lhe modifications to the head design were evaluated to determine compliance with the original mass and geometry design criteria. A series of impact tests were performed using the drop-tower impactor with the modified head and the compliant insert in place. A comparison was made between loads as measured by the impactor and those of the load-sensing face. GEOMETRY REVIEW Before modifications could take place, a review of the existing Hybrid III head had to be performed to determine hew much materiell could be removed from the anterior portion of the face. lhe review indicated that a maximum thickness of 1.9 inches could be removed without interference with existing electronic and physical components of the head. Even at this depth, a small modification had to be made to the anterior portion of the Hybrid III six- axis neck mount. lhe modification in no way interfered with the electronics, particularly the triaxial accelerometer which is mounted on the six-axis neck plate to measure the accelerations of the center of gravity of the head. A minor modification was also required on the first superior neck disk to eliminate interference between the neck and modified head. It was determined that a total displacement of 1.5 inches was required for the facial compliant insert/skin combination to meet the necessary biamechanical requirements. Review of the thickness of the skin determined that the compliant insert would require a thickness of 1 inch (see figure 13) of the available 1.9 inches. This left a remaining 0.90 inches in which to construct the force sensing plates and install the force sensors. Figure 13 - Half -Sect ion - Compliant Insert and Impact Plate Assembly. IÛAD SENSING PLATES LOAD WASHER MOUNTING ASSEMBLY - The best candidates for commercially available load sensing elements were Kistler load washers (see figure 14) . Model 9001 for below the frontal region and model 9011 for the frontal region. Table 2 lists the pertinent technical data for each load washer. Figure 14 - Kistler Load Washer.

Above the load washer, a shear spacer was introduced first, to insure that any oblique impacts greater than 30 degrees would not transmit significant shear loads to the load washer. Second, the mounting screws were not capable of withstanding maximum environmental shear loads. The shear spacer eliminated any shear load to the mounting screw. A general layout for the load washers was selected as depicted in Figure 16. Each impact plate consisted of three load washers configured in a triangular pattern. The triangular pattern 1640</page><page sequence="8">Figure 15 - Half-Section - Mid and Lower Face Impact/Load Cell Assembly. t , Nas0 Left Max Frontal Mand ilia 1 î b I . Left Zygomatic .

Therefore, a frontal, load-sensing plate was constructed from the existing frontal portion of the aluminum Hybrid III skull casting, modified by adding three, flat, load- bearing surfaces on the interior of the casting to coincide with the three load cells that were to be mounted on the backing plate (see figures 17 and 18) . Here, the larger 9011 Kistler load washer was utilized. lhe backing plate thickness was increased to allow for the larger thickness of the 9011 load washer, while maintaining sufficient overlap between the shear spacer and backing plate. A numerical analysis was conducted to insure that the frequency range of the impact plates exceeded the design requirements. For both the Kistler 9001 and 9011 load washers, the rigidity of the transducer was supplied by the manufacturer (see table 2) . lhe weight of the impact plate and associated mounting hardware was now known, lhe frontal plate was found to have a natural frequency &gt; 7500 Hertz, lhe mid and lower facial iitpact plates were found to have a natural frequency &gt; 10,000 Hertz. In both cases the natural frequency exceeded the desire operating frequency of 5000 Hertz. tMod lasting dod Locāt Cast Aluminum Cr Ou oss- 1 i i 1 tied f i i i ng i ons ed Sec Support Frontal Fronto Head 1 1 on I Cast i ng dod i tied Frontal lasting Support Locāt i ons Aluminum Head Cr oss- Sec 1 1 on Ou 1 1 i nes Figure 17 - Schematic of Iitpact Plates.

Next, individual slots, as depicted in Figure 20, were constructed for each of the load cells. This included slots for electronic leads, and holes drilled throu^i the backing plate where the leads were routed into the skull. Inside the skull, the leads were collected to an Amphenol connector that allowed bundling of the leads to the electronic gathering instrumentation. Figure 21 shows the finished modified head with the compliant insert. Figure 21 - Modified Head with Compliant Insert. IÛAD WASHER MOUNTING ASSEMBLE TESTING Concerns arose that the shear spacers might attenuate the impact loads measured by the load cells as a result of interference with the side of the hole in which they were inserted. To study this possibility, impact tests were per- formed on the face at impact angles of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, and 30 degrees. The reference load for each impact test was the drop tower impactor used earlier to test the compliant insert samples for the face. To insure a normal impacting surface for the drop tower impact head, a modified maxillary plate was produced such that the impact surface was always normal to the impactor. Figure 22 shows the modifications for the 30 degree impact test. ^ nrop Tower Impact Head Compi I an t y Insert v a ( Modified ' Maxillary [ ' Plata ' Figure 22 - Off-Axis Impact Test Configuration . For each of the tests, the impact force detected by the head and the total force detected by the three maxillary load cell sensors were cross plotted to determine if a variation in slope occurred between the three test setups. It was expected that some signal attenuation would occur. For the 15 degree test, there was an expected reduction in the slope of the cross plot equating to one minus the cosine of the impact angle. This equated with a 3.4 percent signal attenuation by the load washers contained in the maxillary plate. For the 30 degree test, a 13.4 percent signal attenuation was expected as a result of the impact angle. Three impacts were performed for each angle. The results of those tests indicated the 15 degree impacts experienced a 1.6 percent reduction in the slope, where a 3.4 percent reduction was expected. For the 30 degree impact, a 13.4 percent reduction was expected wherein a 12 . 5 percent reduction occurred. In each of these tests, the reduction was slightly less than expected. This was due to shear load cross coupling within the load washers. The specifications found in Table 2 indicate the load washers had a 3 percent cross coupling between the shear forces and normal load forces. The combination of the normal and shear loading to the load washers thereby reduced the amount of attenuation expected on the normal load signal. The results indicated no adverse signal attenuation due to load washer assembly design. 1642</page><page sequence="10">MODIFIED HEAD EVALUATION Overall evaluation of the head assembly required a conduction of impact tests of the modified head. With a completed head assembly, a series of tests were performed with an inserted crushable insert to compare the load sensing capability of the face against the impactor from the drop tower. Figure 23 shows a sample impact to the maxilla region. The tests demonstrated that the load sensing face was capable of reproducing impact loads produced by the drop tower impact head. Figure 23 -Maxilla Impact #l-Force Comparison-Load Sensing Face with Impactor. ERDP TESTING WHH THE DISF The deformable load sensing face was used in drop testing of a production type steering wheel. The main purpose of the tests was to study the effect of the deformable structure on the head acceleration measurements. By impacting different locations on the steering wheels, the facial load cell readings and their correlation to the impact geometry could also be evaluated. TEST PROCEDURE A one-axis accelerometer , measuring head anterior-posterior acceleration, was mounted in the skull cavity. Before each test, a new deformable facial element was placed under the standard Hybrid III facial flesh covering the DISF. The steering wheel was mounted rigidly in such a way that the horizontal plane through the rim was parallel with the ground plane. The face was mounted in a drop test rig, which guides the impact to be purely vertical. The three impact locations chosen for this test series are shown in figure 24. The steering wheel was adjusted so that the tip of the nose was aimed at the cross on each of the impact Figure 24 - Impact Points on the Steering Wheel. locations. A new steering wheel was used for each test. The nominal test velocity was approximately 7 hļ/s. The load cell data was sampled by a modular data acquisition unit, MDAS 7000, with a sampling frequency of 8000 Hz. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS After each test, the deformable element was inspected visually. Apparently the impact was not severe enough to produce large intrusions in the elements. For impact point 1, where the hub is the main impact area, no deformation could be noted on the element. When aiming the nose tip at impact locations 2 and 3, signs of intrusion occurred as depicted in figure 25. The averages of the maximum head accelerations for each impact point are shown in Table 3 . Corresponding values from tests performed with a dummy head without deformable elements, namely the Hybrid III Load Sensing Face (Planath &amp; Nilsson, 1988) , abbreviated LSF, are also included in this table. The head injury criterion (HIC) in Table 3 has been calculated from the anterior-posterior acceleration signal only. Traces from tests with both faces (DISF and LSF) are shown in figure 26. 1 I ' ' I 1 * J zy&amp;oma ' 7 V- Impace point 1 Impact point 2 Impact point 3 Figure 25 - Pattern of Intrusion in DISF Deformable Element. 1643</page><page sequence="11">Table 3 - Averages of HIC and Head Acceleration for Deformable load Sensing Face (DLSF) and Hybrid ITT load Sensing Face (ISF) .

For all three impact points, both maximum head acceleration and HIC are lower for the DLSF than for the LSF, even when the impact velocity is higher. This is explained by the impact energy absorption in the deformable element of the DLSF. The acceleration traces in figure 26 confirm this, especially regarding impact points 2 and 3. LOAD PETI. READINGS Load cell 3 , mounted in the forehead segment, failed in the tests presented here, and is thus not analyzed further (See figure 16) . Load cell peak forces as well as examples of load cell traces are presented in Table 4. A rough estimation of the force distribution over the facial area can be obtained from figure 27 where the force interval corresponding to the load cell peak pressure has been assigned to the loadcell considered and its nearest vicinity. Also in figure 27, steering wheel contours have been marked, to give an impressipn of the impact area. Figure 27 - Head Anterior-Posterior Accelerations; DLSF and LSF. Also in figure 27, steering wheel contours have been marked, to give an impression of the impact area. In impact situation 1, the face impacted a rather uniform area. The highest force readings, between 300 and 350 N, occurred for the forehead (loadcells 1-3) and the maxillary (loadcells 13-15) , probably associated with the hub contour edge underlying the hub surface. For the other facial segments, the impact was uniform and of smaller magnitude. The upper spoke/hub intersection impact, point 2, gave a different pattern. The upper spoke struck the maxilla (loadcells 13- 15) , causing peaks greater than 600 N. This steering-wheel region seemed to be of higher stiffness than the surrounding regions, since the main intrusion into the deformable element also occurred in the maxillary area. This impact situation was the only one where the nose, represented by loadcells 7-9, registered an 1644</page><page sequence="12">Tfcble 4 - Maximum loadcell Forces; DESF in Steering Wheel Tests.

Also uniquely for impact point 2 , there were very low force readings on the forehead load cells, below 50 N, probably due to the forehead not hitting any steering wheel region directly. The lower spoke impact, point 3, is somewhat concentrated on one side of the face. The force distribution and the element deformation depicts the suggested steering wheel impact. The main intrusion in the deformable element occurred just below the nose tip, i.e. on the maxilla. Both the maxilla and the mandible areas exhibit peak forces well above 300 N, the zygoma region significantly less. The highest reading however, is for load cell number 1, which impacts the upper spoke. COMPARISON DISF - ALLSOP IMPACT TESTS Peak forces of the loadcells forming the maxilla and the zygoma were added to obtain a total load on the facial structure. Loadcells 13-15 formed the maxilla, while the zygoma was made up by loadcells 4-2 . In facial impact testing on cadavers reported by Allsop et al. (1988) , fracture forces for these facial bones were determined based upon acoustic emisisons. The average fracture forces from the tests with a 14.5 kg impactor are shown in Table 5, together with the DISF loadcell maximum forces from the steering wheel drop tests. Comparison of the values in this table show that all DISF readings are belcw the average fracture forces reported by Allsop (Ref) .

Where some remaining intrusion of the deformable element did occur, i.e. impact points 2 and 3, the acceleraiton curve shpaes differed. Thus, the closest resemblance between the acceleration curve shapes for DISF and LSF are found for impact point 1 (hub) , where the facial inserts do not exhibit any intrusion. A reason, for the small amount of deformation of the elements could be the geometry and compliance of the impacted surface. Surface and underlying structures will affect force readings. When comparing the results from the steering wheel tests with facial impact research on cadavers (Ref) , the maximum loadcell forces for areas corresponding to the human maxilla and zygoma were lower than the average cadaver fracture forces. The impact used by Allsop was however of a higher severity. CONCLUSIONS Upon completion of head modifications, insert material specifications, and testing of the combined components, a number of general conclusions and recommendations were reached. These conclusions and recommendations were organized into three basic areas: first, the compliant insert material; second, evaluation of the modified Hybrid III head; and third, proposals for further work to expand impact response data for the human face. COMPLIANT INSERT MATERIAL - The Polyurethane material , after modification through volume reduction by drilling holes in the material , was capable of demonstrating a linear stiffness of the correct magnitude to properly simulate the biofidelity of the face. A drill size 'H' (0.2660 inches) with a 0.4 inch equilateral triangular drill pattern reduced the Polyurethane foam density to produced the correct stiffness for both the zygomatic and maxillary regions of the face. he self restoring materials tested did not exhibit the necessary linear stiffness to properly model the biofidelity parameters defined by Allsop [1]. 1645</page><page sequence="13">It was discovered that the same volume reduction was required for both the maxillary and zygomatic regions despite the difference in the stiffness derived fremi cadaver data. It was concluded that the overall geometry of the Hybrid III face had a strong effect on the stiffness of the insert when impacted by the cylindrical iirpactor used by Allsqp. For steering wheel impact, discernable crushing to the foam insert appeared to occur only when impact forces exceeded the bone fracture level reported by Allsqp. HEAD MODIFICATIONS - A head was designed and tested that was capable of measuring impact loads to the face and forehead region for frontal impacts. This head was capable of measuring normal impact loads with impacts up to 30 degrees from normal, while maintaining a ±2 percent accuracy, lhe frontal plate was capable of measuring loads up to 7000 pounds with a destruction limit of 8000 pounds. Each mid and lower face plate was capable of measuring loads up to 5100 pounds with a destruction limit of 6000 pounds. lhe frontal plate had a natural frequency of &gt;7,000 Hertz exceeding the required 5000 Hertz, lhe mid and lower face plates had a natural frequency of &gt;10,000 Hertz, lhe frontal impact plate was capable of withstanding accelerations of up to 800 gfs peak, -lhe mid and lower face plates were capable of withstanding accelerations of up to 540 g's peak. Modifications to the head allowed the current neck load cells and head accelerometers to be used. the head modifications do not interfere with neck flexion up to 60 degrees. (A small modificaiton was required on the six axis neck plate and Hybrid III neck. ) The modif ied-head/compliant-insert combination simulated the human cadaver face for a cylindrical impact surface as tested. Impacts with surfaces of other geometries are expected to produce questionable results because of possible stiffness variations associated with impactor geometry. Verification for other impact surface geometries will require further cadaver and complaint insert impact studies. REFERENCES 1. Allsqp, Douglas "L", Charles Y. Warner, Milton G. Wille, Dennis C.
