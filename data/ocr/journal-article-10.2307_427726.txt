<plain_text><page sequence="1">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION KARL ASCHENBRENNER In his "Esthetics and the Theory of Signs" Charles W. Morris produced a valuable application of the threefold division of Semiotic into Semantics, Syn- tactics, and Pragmatics, to the arts or the theory of the arts.' Although Morris' article, since its publication in 1939, has received considerable attention, the analogy itself has not, perhaps mainly because his treatment of the work of art as a sign has not received unqualified support. The fact is that one need not commit oneself, as Morris does, to the view that the work is in any sense a sign. Elaborate attempts of this sort, by Mrs. Langer for example, though stimulating in many ways, have seemed to issue in paradox and obscurity.2 This is not to deny the significance of Morris' study as a whole. On the contrary, our purpose here is to revise his principal thought and to extend it in a way that will help to clarify the problems and methods of aesthetics. We shall first glance at the character of the conflict between aesthetic theories in the past. Of course such conflict is not inherently deprecable and may testify to the vitality of the sub- ject. Inevitably, however, one looks toward a synthesis. Morris' purpose, and ours, is to show that most of the conflict can be effectively eliminated by use of the threefold analogy. A common feature of aesthetic theorizing has been the effort somehow to de- fine art or beauty or to state their "essence." Anyone moderately acquainted with this history knows about the parade of formulae from imitation down to expression of emotion and significant form. Taken by themselves they are of course over-simplifications, and from them aesthetics has seemed to reap nothing but contempt for itself. One must hasten to add, since the contemners never do, that the theorizings in their development beyond these first-page formulae are as a rule quite subtle and perceptive. But granting that, their weakness is still the effort to interpret art works or certain aspects of them by means of monistic and universalistic formulae, staking everything on one throw such as "imitation" or "expression of emotion." Subtler theories may set two universals against one another, such as intellect and passion, or form and content. We must of course avoid simplifying still further theories which are already oversimplified. We can give only the briefest documentation of the often sweeping "defini- tions" of the "nature" of art or of beauty in which the history of aesthetics 1 Charles W. Morris, "Esthetics and the Theory of Signs," The Journal of Unified Science (Erkenntniss), VIII, 1-3, 131-150. Susanne K. Langer, Feeling and Form (New York, 1953) and Philosophy in a New Key (Harvard, 1942). Mrs. Langer sees an advantage in regarding the arts as languages, as sym- bols. But what the advantage is is obscured by her concession that art is not "discursive" but "presentational," that "art is formally and essentially untranslatable," that"music has all the earmarks of a true symbolism except one: the existence of an assigned connotation" (Philos- ophy in a New Key, ch. 8). Incisive criticism of the view that works of art are symbols is found in Kingsley B. Price, "Is a Work of Art a Symbol?" Journal of Philosophy, L, 16,485-503. 90</page><page sequence="2">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 91 abounds. Even if we go no farther than the anthologies of Carritt and Rader we can find apt illustrations. 3 Cicero and St. Thomas Aquinas suggest formal criteria and, as is often done by formalists, also add a word about sensuous quality. "There is a certain apt disposition of bodily parts," says Cicero, "which, when combined with a certain agreeable colour, is called beauty."4 St. Thomas lays down three requirements: "First, a certain wholeness or perfection, for whatever is incomplete is so far, ugly; second, a due proportion or harmony; and third, clarity, so that brightly coloured things are called beautiful."5 Dewitt Parker rightly insists that "in art the sensuous medium of the expression receives an attention and possesses a significance not to be found in other types of expression."6 His main criteria are, however, formal, consisting of six principles: organic unity, or unity in variety, theme, thematic variation, balance, hierarchy, and evolution or unity of process in the development of the work of art. Beauty is discussed also in passing in Berkeley's Alciphron; here again the formal and the sensuous are the essentials: Beauty consists "in a certain symmetry or proportion pleasing to the eye."8 We could continue, from Hume to David Prall, with similar examples. But not all formalists will say as flatly as Sir Joshua Reynolds, that "the beauty of form alone, without the assistance of any other quality, makes of itself a great work,"9 or will as summarily reject, for example, the relevance of semblance value as does Roger Fry when he writes that "no one who has a real understand- ing of the art of painting attaches any importance to what we call the subject of a picture-what is represented."10 When we turn to the emotivists and hedonists we encounter an equal self- confidence of tone. So Veron says, "by way of definition, art is the manifestation of emotion," and "the merit of a work of art can be finally measured by the power which it manifests or interprets the emotion that was its determining cause." As to the unity which the formalist is so interested in, the same power or emotion constitutes for the work of art "its innermost and supreme unity." Imitation, or semblance value, is rapidly discounted. An artist is no "copying machine," and if he were, the value of his work would be no more than that "of a more or less exact proces-verbal, and it would perforce remain inferior to reality." Finally "the beautiful in art springs mainly from the intervention of the genius of man when more or less excited by special emotion."11 His views, like those of the formalists, are nevertheless subtle and imaginative, much more so in respect to the matter of emotion than those of Tolstoy who insists that "if only the spectators or auditors are infected by the feelings which the author 38 E.

Further, "not only is infection the sure sign of art, but the degree of infectiousness is also the sole measure of excellence in art."12 We are inclined to look to Plato as the author of the imitation theory, but no one who considers R. C. Lodge's exhaustive study of Plato's thoughts on matters aesthetic, to say nothing of the principal dialogues themselves, will think him to have held only to such a narrow formula.13 The late seventeenth century is a better source for the doctrine of semblance value. The Abbe Batteux reduces the fine arts, as the very title of his work proclaims, to a single principle, the imitation of nature, not as a passive registration of a nature independent of us, but as a response to nature already permeated, in a kind of proto-Kantian way, by human values and sentiments.14 We have already mentioned Reynolds' em- phatic praise of form. Excusing him perhaps as an artist and not demanding of him the rigor and consistency of a theorist, we need not be surprised at his insistence also upon what must be learned from nature, provided that we "select, digest, methodize, compare."15 Unfortunately we cannot balance the record with copious quotation of the perceptive and often profound analysis and exposition which are also easily found in most of the foregoing, nor with confirmation of the manner in which they so often illuminate the arts and works of art of their own place and time. Our business is with the implications of the kind of basic definitions here exemplified and with the solution of the problems their conflicting claims raise. The threefold analogy affords a clue for this. The application of the analogy lies in a classification based upon the relations which the art work has in two directions. 1. Interior relations. The art work has first of all relations within itself. A picture or a church fagade has areas of color as variously related spatially as we care to take note of. It has shape and contains shapes. Special categories such as pattern, line, region, and the like fall under the general category of form. The application of the concept of form to arts other than spatial ones is also familiar. Whatever has parts has form in this sense, and every work of art up to, but excluding, the limiting case of the absolute monolith, the canvas totally blank or totally colored in some other single way, and to the single pedal note on the organ sustained, let us say, for five minutes, has form in this simple, unambiguous way. 2. Exterior Relations. The exterior relations of the art work are as numerous as we care to count but of course we can arbitrarily keep the number to any convenient minimum. A picture has relations to the artist, to the spectator or participant, to many distinct classes of spectators, to spectators past, present, and future. Again, it has relations to reality by resembling a slice of it or what might be a slice of it. It has relations, if we want to pursue another line of thought, to its place or time, to the civilization in which it was produced. I What is Art? (1896). (Rader). Rupert C. Lodge, Plato's Theory of Art (New York, 1953).

Reynolds, op. cit.</page><page sequence="4">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 93 Furthermore, it has important relations to other works of art, forming with them part of a school or style or type. There is no place where we must stop in this catalogue of exterior relations. Plato found the artefact, and the picture of the artefact, to have a relation to one or more ideal forms, having an independent reality, and pious men have speculated on the relation of the aesthetic to God. Our first scheme for the classification of theories is twofold: theories which emphasize the interior relations or particular interior relation of the work, and theories which emphasize one or more exterior relations and which moreover regard the chosen relation, or the relata, as somehow decisive of a unique aesthetic value or as indicative of some special aesthetic "essence." The threefold analogy is based upon (1) the interior relations, and upon two of the exterior relations, that is, (2) upon the relations of the art work to reality, and (3) its relation to the creator, participant, interpreter, or in short, to the minds that respond to it. Some of the theories that are expanded from these are formalism, imitationism, and emotivism or emotionism. The third case would not necessarily involve exclusive expatiation upon emotion, but in his- torical fact the emotional and hedonic aspects of aesthetic responsiveness have received the greatest amount of attention and emphasis in the study of this relation. Earlier theories have generally inclined more toward monism and exclusion than to any judicious eclecticism which grants the cooperative effectiveness of many or all of these factors or relations. As against what was decried as cold formalism (itself often a monistic formula), the age of Revolution and Roman- ticism insisted that Gefiihl ist alles. If only the feeling conveyed or stimulated by the work was strong or subtle or elevated enough, the form would take care of itself. Or again, if one were but truly faithful in the presentation or represen- tation of nature both form and feeling would follow. Careful reading of the theories commonly reveals that the factors which may be omitted or deliberately excluded in the programmatic statements about the "essence" or "definition" of art (as "form" may be omitted in an emotive theory) are in the end conceded to have at least a contributory value. So Boileau, usually thought of as an arch-formalist, need be read with but modest care and he will be found to have made any number of concessions to emotion.16 Or again, the imitationist will concede that formal demands must not be ignored; he may take emotion or pleasure in the art work for granted. In this weighing of factors which are thus found in the art work and the response to it, and which are elevated and exhibited for the explanatory pur- poses of theory, there are several courses open to the theorist: he can pursue a completely single-minded course and expunge all but a given explanatory factor; he can accord several factors equal contributory explanatory value; he can exalt one factor and subordinate or subsume several others. The first of these is what we may call aesthetic monism; the others are varieties of aesthetic eclecticism. Must we then be content to choose between these, or are there other solutions? 1 Nicolas Boileau-Despr6aux, L'Art Poetique.</page><page sequence="5">94 KARL ASCHENBRENNER Let us first clarify the question. It must be admitted that all this juggling of factors is an arid business. Form is not added to imitation which is added to emotion, as in a recipe. Nor is the subordination of one factor to another a known quantity. The problem of aesthetics is not one of defining or analyzing one or three or more factors but of answering certain questions. I formulate them as follows: (1) Does the appropriate response to a work of art involve the emotion of the participant? (2) Are there in works of art significant, repeatable patterns of order which are relevant to their being taken as works of art? (3) Is every work of art in some definite sense a semblance of some real thing in the same sense modality and, if so, is this of any consequence to its being responded to as a work of art? If, as seems apparent, these questions are significant, they must have signifi- cant answers. If we think of the traditional theories in answering them, we find that the first question ought readily to receive an affirmative answer. There is no question but that, however vague the phrase "aesthetic experience" may be, the emotions of the participant are stirred by works of art when he has such an experience. This does not as yet dispose of questions such as whether such emotion is a special aesthetic emotion or how aesthetic emotional responses differ from others such as love, hatred, pity, and fear. It merely notes that emotion is an ingredient in the situation. The principal question is as to what decisive im- portance emotion has in it. Theories of emotivism, from the crude "chill up the spine" school to very refined ones, unite in exalting this factor to a supreme place: the work of art is first of all an "expression of emotion" and participation is emotional sharing of what is so expressed. If we now seek to correct this monistic formula, we do not deny that emotion is a condition, possibly even a necessary condition, of aesthetic experience. We say rather that it is not a sufficient condition of it. By way of comparison, we may consider an apt opinion of Peirce about the distortion of the task of logic which is the result of universalizing a correspond- ing pragmatic factor: Sigwart says that the question of what is good logic and what bad must in the last resort come down to a question of how we feel; it is a matter of Gefiihl, that is, a Quality of Feeling ... For he says that if any other criterion be employed, the correctness of this criterion has to be established by reasoning, and in this reasoning antecedent to the establishment of any rational criteria we must rely upon Gefiihl ... Good! This is good intelligent work such as advances philosophy-a good, square, explicit fallacy that can be squarely met and de- finitively refuted.17 It is obvious that any sound logical argument which is really seen to be sound produces conviction and that this conviction is felt. We do not feel about arguments we think sound as we do about unsound ones or about a series of statements from which "nothing seems to follow." But no amount or degree of '7 Charles Sanders Peirce, Collected Papers (Harvard U. P., 1934), 5.86. See also other refer- ences in Peirce to Sigwart and to what Peirce calls "the fundamental mistake of confounding the logical question with the psychological question." The same point is made repeatedly in the work of Gottlob Frege.</page><page sequence="6">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 95 such feeling is in the least relevant to the soundness or validity of an argument. The error for logic, as we see from Peirce, is to universalize the necessary con- dition of our finding an argument sound, a certain strength of feeling, into a necessary condition or a definitive statement of logical value, the validity of an argument. In a parallel way dogmatic aesthetic emotivism would locate aesthetic value in the strength of feeling which works of art produce in us. The extent then to which our answer to the first question is affirmative, is that we grant that what counts as aesthetic experience always involves emotion. An object which did not stir any feeling in us would be one to which we were indifferent, and indifference and boredom are everywhere the death of art. But from this nothing follows about the value of the object. If we place its value solely in its causal properties, the emotive effect, we degrade it to the status of a drug. It is then immaterial which drug we take, this work of art or that one, so long as it has the desired effect. Such a monstrous distortion of the place of art in human culture is the danger in all versions of uncompromising aesthetic emoti- vism. We turn now to our second question. Ancient and many modern formalisms have often rested their case on the persuasive formula of unity in variety. The weakness of this lies not in what is affirmatively said but in not saying enough or in sufficient detail. Formalism contends that some form is decisive of value, but its most common failing lies in not expounding the intervening steps between the general formula it offers and the concrete felt, seen, or heard order of the art work before us. Hence we do not know exactly how we have been enlightened by learning that it has, or has not, in the critic's opinion, the maximum degree of variety compatible with its being a well-ordered whole. It must not be thought that it offers us no enlightenment whatever. There are no judgments that we can give about a work of art with more conviction than that it succeeds because it is so well-organized and harmonious, so variegated and interesting in its details, or that it fails because it seems utterly chaotic or monotonous. It is simply not true, as sceptics like to have it, that judgments about "unity" are in- herently vague and meaningless. The "new criticism" showed how superficial and irrelevant many other kinds of criticism were and how much we could learn about coherence by intensive and exclusive concentration on individual works and their structure. An affirmative answer to our second question can be based only upon a satis- factory revision of formalism. What might be called classical formalism urges the reasonableness of the following demands: a successful work of art is one in which (1) all that is relevant to the theme of the work is present in it, (2) nothing irrelevant is present, and (3) all its parts are arranged as advan- tageously as possible for expressing the theme. In many contexts, where we can clearly identify something that can be called "theme" in a work, these demands are in fact reasonable. Any re-statement of formalism will probably have to accept them in principle. But while the demands are sound enough as they stand, the analysis ought to be carried still further to evolve a precise definition of</page><page sequence="7">96 KARL ASCHENBRENNER relevance, or as we may also say, coherence.18 A study of this concept would involve among other things, a comprehensive review, which cannot be attempted here, of the literature of the subject down to the development of the notion of the "good Gestalt" in the present century. An essential component in the concept of coherence will be the artistic de- vice of repetition. Two pairs of terms, which are inevitable in the critic's vocabu- lary, testify to the conviction concerning which parts of the art work belong to- gether and which do not, namely unity and variety, monotony and chaos. These cannot be analyzed without recourse to identity and difference as displayed in the repetition, or contrast, of the elements of the art work. Monotony is an un- desirable preponderance of repetitive elements, chaos an insufficiency of repeti- tion. Unity therefore becomes the virtue to which monotony stands as a vice, and variegation a virtue against chaos as vice. Since repetition is an eminently veri- fiable concept, we are able to diminish the vagueness which commonly permeates the use of the four key formal concepts defined in terms of it. There remains of course the problem of specifying still more clearly what constitutes "undesirable preponderance" and "insufficiency of repetition." This cannot be done without copious reference to specific works in specific media. But apart from this, we must remember that the purpose of theory and analysis here is not to do the critic's work for him but to clarify for him the precise character of the questions which he is to address to the work before him. This is done by setting up an order of concepts which become progressively more specific and verifiable. Thus, if he is first confronted with the issue, is this good or bad, beautiful or ugly, we do not allow him simply to intuit an answer, and let it go at that. He is advised next to ask, is it coherent or incoherent? This is specified further in terms of the four concepts we have considered; these lead us to the devices of repetition and contrast. We would proceed then to specify these in special artistic media. A critic who can support his initial good-bad judgment with this kind of articulated knowledge of the work and its medium does all that can possibly be expected of him, and he is in principle no more the victim of a hopeless "subjectivity" than is a critic of economic processes, or physical and mental health, or any number of other human concerns, who has specific and applicable criteria to work with. If these ideas then are what the aesthetic formalist has singled out for em- phasis, there can be no question of repudiating formalism as a whole any more than there can be one of repudiating emotivism as a whole. The task is to create an adequate formalism. But there is vastly more to the concepts of form and coherence than our necessarily oversimplified analysis in terms of repetition would suggest. An adequate study of them would have to consider all possible ways in which the elements of art works bear upon and belong to one another. Let us consider how the traditional form-matter formulation bears upon this, and the impli- cations of a much needed revision of it. 8 A defense of the use of the logical "form vocabulary" in aesthetic and critical discourse is made by Douglas N. Morgan in his "Logical Language and Non-Objective Painting," Atti del III Congresso Internazionale di Estetica (Torino, 1957), pp. 548-552. The logician tends to have a proprietary attitude toward such terms as "cohere:nce," "consistency," ar.cn the .ike.</page><page sequence="8">FAESTHET C THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 97 When we speak of the analysis of a work of art, we do not mean an intellect- ualistic rehash of its contents but keen conscious following of its internal rele- vancies and structure, of the patterns of leading from part to part which con- stitute it a coherent whole.19 For this purpose the traditional juxtaposition of matter and form may be conceded to be of little use. As Mr. Isenberg and others have shown, we can dispense with the conception which sets representative content in opposition to form as if the latter were an empty container for it.20 Representative content is a set of connotative references uniting parts of the work to one another. So, for example, in a painting upon the theme of the Annunciation the spectator must bring to the painting the details of the story in which an Angel arrives as the messenger of God to inform the Virgin of events that are about to happen. The two figures are not only united as figures in a space but as personalities, one speaking, one attending to what is spoken. The "con- notations" of such elements can serve to reinforce the strictly plastic and spatial lines of internal relevance. Connotative relations are thus fully as formal as the plastic ones since they involve "leadings" from element to element. The elements are therefore not reducible to sense data to which it has often proved tempting to reduce the elements entering into purely plastic relations. When we commonly speak of "seeing this dog, this child," we see them as dogs, as children. Hence whatever is seen in anything like an Annunciation, the Angel, the Virgin, cannot be ex- cluded as aesthetically irrelevant. The effort at the behest of certain epistemo- logical theories, to limit "seeing" to sense data is certainly unwarranted here if anywhere. Much more useful than the form-matter distinction, which nearly always leads to false schisms, is the form-element distinction, which can include all that is valuable in the other. In contrast to the use of the term "element" in physical science, its aesthetic use is not that of designating an irreducible standard part. Here we use the term in such a way that elements are contained within elements. So a single note in musical work is an element bearing upon other single notes, the chord of which it is a part is an element bearing upon another chord, and so on through a series until we reach the maximal elements which divide the whole work. The most remarkable fact about such elements is that they exert non-causal influence upon one another. The mere compresence of aesthetic elements in any context in which they are heard together, or seen together, renders them different in quality from what they are outside the context or in relative isolation. This is a fact known even to a house painter, to say nothing of the creative artist. Since the character of elements alters under such changing conditions, their relations, their relevance and coherence, their bearing upon and fitness to one another are likewise modified. Such relations have a certain analogy to those "internal relations" which the metaphysics of idealism thought it found in the universe at large, erroneously, as most philosophers would now 9 "Form is the creation of an appetite in the mind of the auditor, and an adequate satisfy- ing of that appetite." Kenneth Burke. 0 Arnold Isenberg, "Perception, Meaning, and the Subject-Matter of Art," The Journal of Philosophy, XLI (1944), 561-575.</page><page sequence="9">98 KARL ASCHENBRENNER think. But whatever the error of idealism, the aesthetic fact is not based upon a metaphysical interpretation but is empirically confirmable. In addition to the contextual variation of the character of the aesthetic ele- ment, whether plastic or connotative, there is the further fact that their appeal is similarly variant, that is, they vary in the degree of emotive or hedonic satis- faction they afford. We may call the character and the appeal of an element in relative isolation its elemental character and elemental appeal, its character and appeal in context, its formal character and formal appeal. We can now consider the principal question of this section, how formal char- acteristics bear upon the value of aesthetic complexes. The elemental ap- peal of an element is finally and utterly incorrigible, and if our critical dis- agreements turn upon the sheer elemental character and appeal, they are in principle insoluble. On the other hand, if our disagreement touches upon con- textual or formal properties we can refer to relations of relevance, leading, and connection upon which our judgment is based. Criticism can therefore con- sider only form. Perhaps an analogy with other incorrigibles, those of perception, will make this still clearer.2' If two persons disagree as to whether they are confronted by a wasp or hornet, recourse can be had to the specific characteristics of these insects, their wing structure, shape of head, length of antennae, etc. But it has been obvious to philosophers of practically all schools that some predicates defy any effort at further specification, for example, yellow, cold, sweet, etc. If you have had no experience of yellow, these is no further set of more specific predicates to which I can draw your attention to convey the idea to you. There is nothing further to be said to describe yellow except to say that it is yellow. Any other effort I make to convey the idea will necessarily be one of comparison only, or will presuppose it: it is the color of the yolk of an egg, it is brighter than brown, etc. If, however, we can specify the ordering relations of aesthetic elements, we are in a position to argue for or against their aesthetic value. For if you and I disagree as to whether this picture or this musical composition is bad and I find it utterly inchoate, I have given you the opportunity to exhibit the ordering relations you find in it. But if I object to the elemental character of the tones produced by the zither or saxophone, my judgment is incorrigible. To handle aesthetic disputes and dissents we must first try to discover what kind of judg- ment we are dealing with. Admittedly, even in the case of judgments about form or order, you may not convince me, or change my attitude; but this can occur even in the instance of a dispute over logical subject matter, which inherently admits of conclusive demonstration, if I am not very competent at following the course of an argument. We have then, I think, given sufficient reason for answering our second question affirmatively, that the patterns of order in aesthetic objects have a bearing upon their value. Cf. K. Aschenbrenner, "The Formal Basis of Criticism," Atti del III Congresso Inter- nazionale di Estetica (Torino, 1957), pp. 221-224.</page><page sequence="10">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 99 Our third question presents many difficulties. When we ask whether works of art derive some of their value from their apparent resemblance to real or po- tential life or reality, we receive a variety of answers, often with much vehe- mence. So, for example, in Umberto Boccioni's Futurist Manifesto of April 11, 1912, we read: 1) We proclaim that sculpture shall be committed to the abstract reconstruction of planes and volumes which determine form, and not their figurative value. 2) We propose to abolish in sculpture as in every other art the traditional sanctity of the subject. 3) We deny to all sculpture any aim whatsoever of veristic, episodic reconstruction, and affirm the absolute necessity to make use of the whole of reality by returning to the essential elements of plastic sensibility.. . In February of 1910 Boccioni, Severini, Bolla, and others had demanded: 1) The destruction of the cult of the past, and the obsession with the antique, of pedantry, and academic formalism, 2) Profound contempt for every form of imitation, 3) Sweeping off the ideal field of art all the old enfeebled motives and subjects.23 The entire subject is now so banal as to need no further documentation, and we shall give only an indirect answer to the question whether the painter or sculptor ought to produce either abstract or representational works. The issue suffers from the effort to pursue two entirely different ends at once, producing inevitable confusion between them. These two ends are those of the articulation of theories, descriptions or explanations, on the one hand, and the promulgation of creeds, imperatives and resolutions, on the other. The promulgators of creeds, like the futurist creed, are inciting to activity of a certain sort and seeking to impede activity of another sort. In this capacity they offer no explanation or theory of art in its existent entirety though usually they imply or presuppose at least a fragment of such a theory: only that in the past which resembles what we now proclaim in our plan of action, they say, is genuine art, the rest is sterile and worthless. The danger lies in not seeing that a good reason for promoting certain actions may be and generally is quite different from the reasoning or the evidence for a good theoretical account of the field in which the action is to be undertaken. It is the same difference and involves the same danger of confusion as is to be found between a political theory and a political party platform. The sound political theorist selects the examples he theorizes about with enough care to distinguish mere mobs from organized societies, even if problematic borderline cases arise. Once he has done so, his theory must take account of all of the included or segregated cases. When he not only confines himself to one very special system of polity but adds to all this exhortation, homily, and incitement to action, he has ceased to be a theorist. Now in the aesthetic situation the theorist must come to a decision about the Umberto Boccioni, Manifesto Tecnico delta Scultura Futurista (Venice: Edizioni del Cavallino).

Reprint.</page><page sequence="11">100 KARL ASCHENBRENNER extension, in the logician's sense, of the phrase "works of art." There are always to be found, especially amid the ranks of artists, those who will dispute the ability of any but an artist to make this decision. But unfortunately artists, moved by enthusiasms for particular types of art works and by creeds based upon them, have notoriously disagreed about the extension of the term even more than the theorists. They tend moreover from the same causes to assign too nar- row an extension to it, and often absurdly narrow, for example refusing to con- sider anyone an artist between the medieval primitives and Cezanne except possibly El Greco. When we free ourselves from these intolerant attitudes, we construe the extension practically as wide as anyone wishes to make it. Nothing prevents our reserving the highest valuations to only a tiny fraction of the works comprised in the total extension of art works, but it defeats at the outset all efforts at intellectual clarification of the problems to insist that the total extension shall at the same time be limited to this exclusive membership. We must, therefore, be prepared to include nearly every kind of painting as a genuine example of the art of painting, following neither the old conservatives who reject abstract painting nor the new conservatives who will include only this. To follow them is, as we have said, to confuse a creed and a theory. At least two explanations for this readily come to mind and there may be others. The rejections may be traced either (1) to moral intolerance, the attitude of using one or another kind of force to restrain others from acting as they wish and here to produce arts that fail to meet someone's approval; or (2) to the conviction that there is some eternal or Platonic universal which is the "inner nature" of the art in question. So far as the latter is at all significant, it is a version of what we have already considered, a dispute about how the word "painting" is to be defined, how its intension and extension are to be specified. One response to this type of dispute would be to coin new words for what some may be in- clined to think are totally new or at least different arts, or in some other way to make new verbal differentiations. So we might advise the new non-objective conservatives, for they are all too eminently grey-haired to be called radicals, to call what they do "painting" and call the old-fashioned representational works they turn their back upon, "quainting." Perhaps, however, their contempt for Raphael does not go so far as this. It is one way of finding out. For the rest, the dispute about pure universals is an ill-digested version of Platonism and deserves only a little more respect than the moral dispute, which deserves none at all. We recur now to the main question: Is every work of art in some definite sense a semblance of some real thing in the same sense modality and if so is this of any consequence to its being responded to as a work of art? At first we may answer, in some arts, yes, and in others, no, and even yes and no in the same arts. For example, we may say that the answer is affirmative in respect to painting but not to music, or in respect to some kinds of music and painting but not to others. The question is obviously not one to be answered hastily and certainly it has received an extraordinary amount of consideration, beginning with Plato. I shall defend the view that all art works are ultimately semblances</page><page sequence="12">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 101 and that this has aesthetic significance. Shorn of universalistic claims this seems to amount to the contention of the classical theory of mimesis or imi- tation. Would we at this late date care to be "seen dead" defending this thesis? Perhaps the thesis can have this kind of defense. Obviously not every picture is a semblance of something such as a plum tree in a field or a bowl of apples. In fact there are pictures which are not semblances at all except to someone who has taken more Rohrschach tests than are probably good for him. In this sense of "semblance" our question will then be answered negatively. We shall call this "naive semblance." But we have by no means disposed of semblance altogether. There remains what we call categorial semblance, and this may be illustrated in the following manner. As soon as brush is put to paper or canvas, the laws of space being what they are, it is inevitable that there be lines, masses of color (having at least two dimensions in fact and often three by simple suggestion), figure, and texture. From Leonardo we learn that the categories of painting are "quality, quantity, place and figure. Quality is shade and all degrees of shade. Quantity is the size of shades, and the relation of size among them. Figure is the geo- metrical form of shade. Place means the composition of shades with regard to figures."24 However we devise and order these categories there are some spatial aspects of even the simplest visual compositions that are shared with reality beyond the border or frame of the composition. And if they share them, this is only another way of saying that they resemble or are semblances of them, and that our response to the one will bear an analogy to our response to the other. So for example, it is, I think, impossible to give prominence to a long catenary line on a canvas and not evoke in some way a response similar to what we see and feel of a wire stretched in the air, or to place two roughly symmetrical masses of color on opposite sides of the vertical axis of a canvas and not have our re- sponse to this in part determined by our experience with a thousand similar situations in daily life. And in fact the entire art of architecture, which unlike painting is not a re-presentative art but inhabits the same space as nature or natural objects, would be impossible if this were not so. The basic values embedded in our response must thus be ultimately derivable from our response to nature even granting that it is a nearly miraculous transformation that takes place when natural lines and masses interact in the picture plane. Similarly, but admittedly more problematically, we should now proceed to an analogous investigation into our responses to sounds. Here we should not be trying to explain music by regarding it as a naive semblance of the crash of thunder or the cries of animals. This will hardly do even for the Carnaval des Animaux. We proceed now rather to relate such categorial aspects as the force and mass of an orchestral tutti played fortissimo to cognate natural experiences and these will include such things as claps of thunder. Pure or absolute instru- mental musical composition owes nothing directly to such phenomena, but each strand of the texture echoes our responses to reality. The quality and value of shrill notes on the piccolo or flute, or the unreal tinkling and twinkling of the celesta, are nowhere to be heard in nature, but shrillness and tinkling 2Lionello Venturi, A History of Art Criticism (New York, 1936), p. 93.</page><page sequence="13">102 KARL ASCHENBRENNER are familiar enough in nature and prepare us for their employment in art. In other words, reality and the art work have certain categorial traits in common. These and many other such questions take us beyond the limits of the ad- mittedly much too simple and simple-minded imitation theory. This title should in fact be confined to theories which seek to relate aesthetic data to reality on the naive semblance level. We have already placed this to one side, where paintings, for example, actually exploit familiar type forms, such as the human figure. We have actually proceeded beyond this to the theory of empathy, and to other theories which set themselves the problem of the origin of expressive values in works of art. It is impossible to examine at length the significance of our question for lit- erature in such genera as the drama, novel, and ballad. The origin of their expressive and communicative values already has an enormous literature of its own. But to consider it briefly we may begin with a distinction between the expressive quality of the linguistic vehicle and that of the impalpable work of literary art as it exists in the reader's imagination. These raise very different issues about imitation, representation, and expression. The second inevitably involves the exploitation of naive semblance value. No one has been able to make literary art in any received sense with anything other than human or quasi-human (e.g., animal) actions in human or anthropomorphic settings, or with personifications of entities and events of an earthly or cosmic environment, however unworldly it may be, or with further extensions of this. Such minor deviant "literary" efforts as are different enough from the usual to seem analogous to "abstract" painting, and therefore to appear to exploit only categorial semblance value, concern rather the first part of our distinction, the expressiveness of a purely auditory linguistic medium and its use for artistic purposes. Such efforts are on the whole merely tiresome. The reasons for this are not far to seek. The syllabic noises or phonemes which constitute the material medium of language have normally no uses besides linguistic uses. The aesthetic use of these, one would judge, has so far at least earned no place among the arts despite the efforts of a handful of surrealists. There is, however, no doubt of the categorial semblance value of the auditory medium and of its effectiveness par- ticularly when this medium is genuinely linguistic, that is, when words, and not just syllabic noises, are used. Of this every line of every competent poet affords proof. How else would anyone come to think of "the surge and thunder of the Odyssey"? It surges and thunders, if it does, not in any naive sense, nor merely because it is a tale of the sea, but categorically, from the quality of the language itself. In addition to the pure syllabic medium, let us consider also another kind of deviant literary medium. Normally, meaningful words as distinct from syllabic noises have a use only in the context of meaningful language used to convey thought, give commands, express wishes, and so on. Suppose that we use language merely to evoke imagery without grammatical syntax, for example at random, "Shoe blue pelican mirror a paper toward." But a word taken out of its natural range of employment is simply a fish out of water. A color patch, on the other hand, has no such limitations. It has no "normal" use and it is not useless apart</page><page sequence="14">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 103 from its use to represent something. We can bring out the helplessness of the "shoe blue" kind of literary art by comparing it with an "art" or a "science" which would scramble mathematical symbols. Such symbols are useful to convey mathematical thought and, so far, nothing else. We cannot, however, dogmatize about what can or cannot be used as an artistic medium. Certainly the prior use of the material of a medium cannot but limit its use outside that context. Beyond that the proof of any pudding is in the eating. We conclude that questions about semblance raised onesidedly by universal- istic imitation theories are significant questions for all of the arts though the special problems in each of them differ very greatly. If we ask also whether semblance is relevant to our responding to objects as works of art, our answer is that since the very fabric of the work involves semblances of one order or another, to respond to a thing as a work of art at all is to respond to semblances whether we are acutely aware of them or not. But this is not to say that sem- blance is therefore a criterion of value. It means only that for purposes of the scientific study of art no account of the function of art works in experience will be complete without our understanding the operation of semblance in them. If we now compare our three factors with one another, we may say that all are necessary but in different ways. Emotivity of response is one demand we rather inevitably make of aesthetic experience. But we cannot very well isolate it and make it a self-sufficient criterion of value without reducing the actual substance and form of the work to mere instrumental values. Categorial sem- blance is also necessary, not as an imposed demand as in the instance of emo- tivity, but as being inevitable in the materials of art, conditioning the experience through and through. Naive semblance on the other hand is dispensable. If present it generally operates as a resource of connotational order under the category of form. Form, finally, as we have sketched its workings, is a thing of full criterial importance. The appeal of elements we found is incorrigible and personal. If we think of value as in any sense objective, elemental appeal is in no sense decisive of it. Form is ultimately decisive of value because it alone can give point and significance to the artist's choice of the particular elements that con- stitute his work. Of the numerous relations of the art work sketched at the beginning, each may in principle be the basis of a significant inquiry into the source of basic aesthetic values. Certainly one other relation cannot fail to seem important in this con- nection. It is in fact even more commonly made the basis of the inquiry after the value of the art work than any of the foregoing. This relation is that which obtains among a number of discrete and complete art works. Art works are con- stantly being compared with one another. One great area of inquiry here is that of art history. This may of course sometimes be purely descriptive and not evaluative in intent. But insofar as it is, it is of consequence for our dis- cussion. A very convincing way of arriving at a judgment of value is to place works of fairly similar content alongside one another and to let the judgment evolve of</page><page sequence="15">104 KARL ASCHENBRENNER itself. Contrasts in detail at once spring to light and vision is at once sharpened respecting what each work contains. All this needs little more than mere mention. There are, however, further observations that may be made about this. Let us ask whether this inquiry is actually autonomous, or whether it merely raises questions and propounds solutions which are ultimately reducible to the other three factors we have already examined: emotive response, form, and semblance. We shall not pursue the question in detail. The evidence for reduc- tivity seems rather strong. What else does a comparison do but sharpen our awareness of difference and similarity? Our comparisons must ultimately turn on at least these three aspects of works of art. In the work of one artist little care is exhibited in the degree of consecutive and consequent leading from part to part, but the emotive impact may be overwhelming. In another quite the reverse may be found. This is of course to oversimplify matters, but we do compare works along these and similar lines. So far the argument is sound. But especially in the history of art we find ourselves making what seems to be a very different kind of comparison and that is the way in which different works illustrate or "participate in " some artistic "historical universal." Only the most rigorous aesthetic nominalism or positivism can resist this. It is difficult not to recognize the cogency of generalizations about such universals as Gothic, Primitive, Baroque, Impressionist, and other varieties of art. Universal and particular are here involved in something of a conflict. The work of art emerges from the artist entirely on its own and demands to be recognized on its own merits. It is not just there to be classified by a critical morphologist. But its intentions, so to speak, are never wholly nor even in large part recognized. Dussek and Hum- mel cannot but be compared with their contemporary, Beethoven. We cannot wholly resist their being judged in terms of the class in which they seem to belong. But does this yield an autonomous province of critical evaluation? We are, I think back again at the task of simple comparison. How can Dussek's stormy sonatas relate by critical comparison to those of Beethoven if not in terms of the relative power and quality of their emotional impact, their formal mastery, and kindred categories? If as a result of this we are inclined, at least provisionally, to restrict aesthetic inquiry to our three main regions, a further argument may nevertheless be ad- vanced against this. We begin by a proposal to restrict the use of two evaluative adjectives in the following way. We distinguish between goodness and greatness. On this usage a work is good in the degree to which it succeeds when judged by certain gen- eral or abstract standards, for example standards pertaining to the coherence or internal relevance of its parts. But "greatness" connotes relative degree, a com- parison between several things complete in themselves. Here we have works of art under judgment not just in respect to how they use their materials in and of themselves, but how successfully they do so in comparison with things of kindred class. So we might find that one work is no less good than another and yet from the limited range and scope of its formal and emotional resources or from weakness of the innate appeal of its elements that it seems quite inferior to the other. To say that the quartets of Beethoven are the greatest ever scored is by no means to deny value to others with which they are compared. An artist</page><page sequence="16">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 105 may justly be expected not to offend by producing a monotonous or chaotic work, but ask him to excel another artist may well be absurd. We are back then inevitably to the notion of universals or kinds of works of art, and if this is not ultimately analyzed into other terms we shall have to accept a fourth kind of critical evaluation. Perhaps a further example will clarify this. Anyone conversant with music cannot deny that a whole mass of short piano compositions produced in the nineteenth century are good, beginning, say, with Mendelssohn's Lieder Ohne Worte and including even a countless number of Feuilles d'Album of very minor composers, They are as a rule formally fault- less: that is, in terms of the criteria we indicated above they contain all that is felt as formally relevant to the basic melodic and other materials the composer has chosen; they include nothing irrelevant to this; and they suggest to us no improvements by way of formal rearrangement of the materials. Again, their emotive content though slight is apt and winning. Though we may reject them as a whole because we are not attracted by Victorian sentiment, it is unfair to decide this matter en bloc. Sentiments come into and go out of fashion. No well-constructed music in the earlier past has yet failed of ultimate revival. Finally, let the semblance value be whatever it is. Such music then is, any num- ber of examples, good, and it can be better or worse depending on how it is evalu- ated by certain standards. That it is great, however, not even the composers would have insisted, supposing that we had in mind the monuments of pianism in the large scale works of, let us say, Schumann or even Liszt or even these com- posers themselves. They would in short have acquiesced in our saying that these minor works are not great. But the hidden premise here turns on the composer's acquiesence in our putting the greatest and least into some class, a class that is constructed in a fair and equitable way. If he did not agree that it was fairly chosen, if he did not think it fair to compare a Romanza with a con- certo, the issue of greatness would then revert to its membership in some other class and its relative greatness therein. There is probably always some class which could be devised such as musical or literary genres (tragedy, ballad, sonata, lied, etc.) and there will also be the "historical universals" such as Gothic, Baroque, and the like. Such reasons may move us to accept comparison within a class as a distinct category of critical evaluation. In any event, it is advisable to keep this kind of criticism, which is based on individual works of art as touchstones of merit within a class, distinct from that which presupposes general standards of judg- ment. We have now in a general way given affirmative answers to three questions dealing respectively with our emotional response to works of art and with form and semblance among their attributes. These are the fundamental questions that should be raised about aesthetic objects when each is taken on its own merits. They do not pretend to be full answers, at least in the form in which we have left them. Since our clue to these several sets of questions was found in the interior and exterior relations of works of art, still other problems and questions may be turned up in the same way from other relations. Confining ourselves to the first three of these questions, we proceed now to</page><page sequence="17">106 KARL ASCHENBRENNER inquire what significance our three affirmative answers have for aesthetics as a whole. If we survey the literature of the subject we find numerous theories seeking to show that some scheme of analysis, some "definition" of art, is thought to have exclusive validity and that the essence of aesthetic creativity and its product is to be found in a hedonic-affective, a formal, a representational, or possibly in some other factor. We have not precisely refuted this claim to exclusiveness for this could only be done by examining each example on its own merits. But we have shown that each of these is a necessary ingredient in the situation by our three affirmative answers, and if we carried this out in detail, it would imply a refutation of the exclusiveness of any theory. It should be plain that each of our three questions adumbrates the subject matter of a meaningful and im- portant inquiry. Moreover, they cover nearly the entire area of what has been over the centuries achieved in the intellectual investigation of art. To what then does all this lead us? It must lead to a reassessment of the whole purpose and achievement of aesthetics. It will be necessary to read the history of aesthetics with an entirely different aim than is usual. We shall discount all universalistic claims, and we shall study each theory not so much to see whether it can defend such claims but rather to see what light it throws on the single fac- tor it tries to universalize. No vital inquiry or science will hesitate to make such appropriation or expropriation from the store of the past. Thus theories which falsely claim that the value of art works is solely their form (or emotional power, or semblance value) may nevertheless yield the most valuable thought hitherto on this aspect of the total problem. They also have another value. Often exclusionist theories are written under the spell of a cer- tain exclusionist kind of art. Works are created which seem to intend, for ex- ample, to be nothing but evocations and provocations of emotional force, as if they were not necessarily also formal complexes of articulate parts in relation to one another which either further or impede the communication of this force. Or on the other hand, we may have works which are imbued with such a studied serenity in the formal mastery of their internal relationships, that we forget that serenity is as much an emotional state as hysterical rage, and that no formal complex, unless we ignore it altogether, can fail to evoke its own quality of feeling. Theories based upon such dominant orientations are one-sided no doubt, but they can also have the virtues of such defects, exploring aesthetic emotion or form or other factors in depth and detail. This leads then to a long overdue revaluation of the history of aesthetics. Scorn for this subject is the more curious when we compare the end and purpose of the subject with that of moral-political history and of the history of human knowledge and error. For no matter how well we may think of the Greek city- state or the empire of the early Caesars or Victorian England or what not, the fact remains that these and many other such are no longer live options but only objects for some kind of contemplation. Nor again does much except the methods of inquiry, and not always that, fully survive of the objects studied by the his- torian of science: there is no point in preserving the memory of error unless it helps us to the truth now. But if a work of art physically survives, it can poten-</page><page sequence="18">AESTHETIC THEORY-CONFLICT AND CONCILIATION 107 tially live forever aesthetically, and the thoughts of a succession of interpreters of it, especially of the contemporaries of its production, may deserve to live nearly as long. There is no guarantee that the quality of succeeding interpreta- tions will progress from age to age. We have then sufficient reason beyond schol- arly antiquarianism to reconsider them. Only the intrinsic yield and not the mere historic value counts. But our principal purpose has not been to conclude with a defense of the his- tory of aesthetics. It is, in a word, to dispose of needless sources of theoretical conflict in the subject. If our three questions can be answered affirmatively, nearly all theories have some claim to respect. How are they then to be recon- ciled or combined? Of course, this can be envisaged only where they are not mutually contradictory. Eclectic combinations of theories are here neither desirable nor inevitable if we mean by eclecticism simply the detachment from each of a few truths but without any basic scheme of choice. Mr. Pepper has based the several members of approximately our assortment of theories each upon what he regards as a "relatively adequate" philosophical system, each having its own set of cate- gories.25 The divergence of these philosophies he finds irreconcilable or at least irreducible, though each supplements the others by its very one-sidedness or purity, and it is possible to enrich the totality of experience by seeing what each system exalts or depreciates. Since the rightness of this solution cannot be de- cided in a few words, we shall offer an alternative to it largely on the grounds that have already been urged: we may regard the competing aesthetic theories (whether or not they are the consequence of general metaphysical theories, as Mr. Pepper holds), not as relatively adequate accounts, or systems of interpre- tation, of the whole field of aesthetic experience, but as severally emphasizing, and illegitimately universalizing, what is only a part of the field. We therefore grant a good deal less than does Mr. Pepper to the prima facie claims of each system to universality, adequacy, and self-sufficiency. It may be admitted that his scheme of interpretation is more faithful to the spirit of each. Our solution proposes to deal rather more roughly with the theories for their intrinsic yield, retaining many of the special insights and analyses of each but discounting at once all claims to self-sufficiency. The differences between theories are rather differences of subject matter, not of a difference of categories interpreting the same subject matter. This brings us at last back to Mr. Morris' threefold analogy, and our applica- tion of it is just this: the regions covered by our three questions are in fact the subject matter of three relatively distinct inquiries or sciences which together comprise the whole of aesthetics. We do not regard the work of art as a sign per se as Morris does but on the analogy of the threefold division of the sciences of language, we regard it as needing study from at least three sides, its interior relations, its relation to reality, and its relation to the minds and states of indi- viduals, that is, the artist and the appreciating participant. The first of these studies ought to be called eidetics, the study of form and structure, the relations internal to the work of art. The second goes by the now a Stephen C. Pepper, The Basis of Criticism in the Arts (Harvard U. P., 1949).</page><page sequence="19">108 KARL ASCHENBRENNER familiar name of iconics, the study of the relation of the work of art, either in form or content, to other members of the perceived world in its own sense mo- dality, by resemblance, by symbolism (which itself is the source of much of Morris' theory), or by expressive power which connects it with external sources. The third, as in Morris' division of semiotic, is called pragmatics, and considers the whole domain of the cause and effect of the art work in relation to the cre- ative or responsive individual, especially the affective aspects of this relation- ship. It is unnecessary to coin a new term to distinguish this part of pragmatics from pragmatics in the theory of language for they are adjacent subject matters, having still other pragmatic and all psychological problems adjoining on other sides. Just as in the theory of language no one any longer, one hopes, thinks of pro- ducing a psychological logic to supplant formal logic but merely recognizes the fact that obviously reasoning has its psychological aspect as does any other human effort, so here we should cease to expect to supplant emotionalist theories by formalist theories or vice versa. There is no choice to be made between these, and if it is offered, something of value is in danger of being ignored. Since all truths are compatible with one another, whatever of truth we find in one of these subordinate inquiries will be harmonious with those of any other. We have not been able in this brief inquiry to see how these truths bear upon one another: how, for example, the formal interior leadings of art works involve our emotions, how we are affected by unconscious mechanisms in our grasp of form, how semblance cognition occurs and modifies the other factors, how emo- tions are "disciplined" by form and semblance, etc. But these are readily sug- gested by the present analysis, which may also help to give some ordered sig- nificance to many other isolated inquiries done in the past in the science and philosophy of art.26 2I am indebted to my colleague, Prof. Edward N. Barnhart, for the pleasure and benefit of many discussions on topics basic to this paper.</page></plain_text>
