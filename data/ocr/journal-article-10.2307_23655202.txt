It suggests that there is a route beyond the trajectory of modernist and postmodernist social thinking and it calls into question the anthropocentric, Cartesian and dualistic assumptions of most conventional sociol ogy. It does so by exploring the possible relationships between sociology and the existential issues thrown up by Asian philosophical and religious traditions, and in particular Buddhism, and the in many ways parallel arguments of Deep Ecology. In doing so it calls into question the adequacy of current sociology as a vehicle for addressing fundamental existential questions and in particu lar the issues of social suffering, the emerging ecological crisis and the alternative conceptions of society generated by many of the new social movements, and suggests ways in which this inad equacy might potentially be resolved. Keywords Buddhism, anthropocentrism, ontologies, Deep Ecology, Eurocentrism, civilisations It is perhaps a little risky in a social science journal to speak of going 'beyond sociology', unless it is understood that this implies the open-minded seeking of new directions in which sociology might go in the new millennium, quite possibly in forms beyond its original formulations and foundations in Euro centric and modernist modes of thought. Potentially these new directions might include the re-centring of international sociological discourse in Asian social theory — contemporary Confucian, Islamic, perhaps, and, most cer tainly, Buddhist, the latter already showing signs of becoming a serious alter native route to asking radically new questions and questioning the foundations of Western modernist knowledge in ways quite different from those of post modernist theory (Loy, 2003; Clammer, 2005), creative ideas emerging from post-development theory, and voices from outside sociology in its institution alised sense, including from feminism, the ecological movement, art, the new social movements, from the recovery of what anthropologists are calling © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009 DOl: 10.1163/156853109X436757</page><page sequence="2">J.

Jung, Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, and Ken Wilbur to name a few prominent examples). The objective of this essay is to call into question the anthropocentric, dualistic and Cartesian presuppositions of conventional soci ology and to move beyond critical sociology towards a reconstructive socio logy in which the discipline becomes a valuable tool in our efforts to respond meaningfully to the challenges of understanding and acting upon the struc tural and discourse transformations at work in the contemporary world. The Task of Sociology Does sociology actually answer the questions that it purports to? This is partly a question of levels of course: at the level of statistical generalisations sociol ogy has proved quite successful but beyond that, 'explanations', the goal of conventional sociology, weaken as they deepen. The primary examples of this, and representing a kind of litmus test for the claims of sociology as a whole, are the subjects of religion, art and suicide. All have attracted a substantial sociological literature, yet little of it is fully satisfying — for example, the paucity and weaknesses of sociological theories of art (Heywood, 1997). Furthermore, since Durkheim sociologists have struggled with the explana tion of suicide, the most insightful and sensitive book that I know of on the subject is the work not of a sociologist but of a literary critic personally acquainted through his friendship with the poet Sylvia Plath with this tragic phenomenon (Alvarez, 1974). There are, I suggest, a number of reasons for this which include an unwill ingness to confront what are in fact the basic existential questions of human life — death, love, embeddedness in nature, illness, the continuation of the old philosophical error of confusing explanation and understanding, and a commitment to a now very outdated model of what sociologists think that the natural sciences do, with a corresponding attachment to a positivistic and reductionist mode of analysis. This is tied to a continuing de facto epistemo logical Eurocentrism signalled by the failure to take the philosophical dimen sions of globalisation seriously: while accepting, and perhaps celebrating, the fact that globalisation and its corresponding universalisation of knowledge makes an ever bigger range of indigenous knowledge available to all of us, while simultaneously refusing to take them seriously as rivals or alternatives to hegemonic Western 'scientific' knowledge, or admitting the possibility that Western sociology and anthropology are, as Marshall Sahlins has argued,</page><page sequence="3">334 J. Clammer /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 simply forms of local knowledge that for historical reasons (imperialism, colo nialism and military power being amongst the main ones) have become effec tively universalised, suppressing as a consequence legitimate alternative local anthropologies and sociologies of other cultures and societies (Sahlins, 1996). Instead, postmodernist theory, posing as a radical critique of modernist high theory, in fact neither questions the fundamental philosophical presup positions of that theory (for example, its anthropocentrism), nor generates constructive ideas for actually confronting the reality of the emerging global crisis — deepening social inequalities, persistent poverty, resource depletion and ecological meltdown (Myerson, 2001). The necessity is to move beyond a simply critical sociology to a reconstructive sociology as a basis for the emer gence of social and civilisational alternatives, current civilisational forms clearly having failed to stave off the deepening crises that the global commu nity now faces. Entrapment within the discourse that sociology has created for itself and which is the legacy of its founding fathers may not be a sufficient model for addressing the human, social and ecological problems of the current century. Even as Marxism was a child of and a profound shaper of a now outdated industrial, resource extractive, polluting and unequal societal order, so too sociology shares in that legacy and, for all its undoubted achievements in throwing light on the organisation of human society, now needs rethinking if it is to have any constructive role in the civilisation that must arise from the failures of the old order if humanity and nature are to have a future at all. Thus, beyond, below and behind the conventional questions of sociology (or the questions of conventional sociology) — issues of class, stratification, deviance, social order and control — , lie ultimately the fundamental existen tial questions — of birth, death, our place in nature, meaning, ends, sleep and dreams, love and suffering — that sociology, having largely severed its roots in philosophy, rarely speaks of. To confront these as the fundamental issues at the heart of existence at all times and in all cultures (however specifically framed or addressed in different instances) poses basic methodological and theoretical questions for the student of the human and social sciences. Given the emerg ing and challenging features of the world system, ecological and social justice issues paramount amongst them, how do we define the nature and scope of our investigations as contemporary sociologists? And, once defined, how do we interrogate it in ways that truly illuminate the human condition to act for change where we believe that to be necessary? How do we site sociology, place it in the context that gives it reality and meaning as an enterprise, that context in fact being nothing less than the basic and evolutionary forces that shape the cosmos? To do this we have to work paradoxically at both the maximal and minimal levels — at the very micro in the internal worlds of individual</page><page sequence="4">J. Clammer / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 335 memory, imagination, anticipation, hope and purpose, and at the very macro level, not only of the world system' and its structural qualities, but also of the cosmic context in which all human systems are embedded, including, pre eminendy, nature. Such an approach must go beyond received categories and, in fact, is in large part a reconstruction of those very categories. Some would even argue that it represents a spiritual rather than a purely 'scientific' path. In his lumi nous study of orthodox Jews in contemporary Jerusalem, Samuel Heilman writes: "The competing authorities of my social science were insufficient, their vision flawed by an almost obstinate flight from all truths... One might live off sociology and anthropology, but to me it seemed impossible to live for them" (Heilman, 1984: 22). His study of this religiously orthodox commu nity forced him to the recognition of the necessity of going beyond the arbi trary limits of 'objectivity' (itself, in fact, a social construction) and to consciously enter a process in which, through confronting the reality and given ness and indeed otherness of a specific and actual community, the sociologist is confronted with the necessity of, in Heilman's terms, 'reweaving the fabric of our lives'. In the conventional social sciences we often find very little, but trivial, outcomes because we are not really looking for much. Clearly sociology has always had a critical and self-critical dimension, and indeed has always been a contentious and even undefined discipline (a charac teristic that it shares with anthropology). However, in most cases it is dis courses within sociology that are critiqued, not the notion of sociology itself. It has sometimes been pointed out that Asian societies (China being the para digm case) have rarely spontaneously produced what in the West would be recognised as sociology and this is seen as some kind of deficiency; this is a serious mistake: all such societies have rich traditions of social thought but primarily expressed through philosophical and religious idioms. One of the central errors of Western sociology and hence of the limits of its explanatory power has been the assumption, again largely deriving from Durkheim, of the autonomy of society: of there being, in other words, a category of phenomena that can be abstracted from and studied independent its larger existential and natural context. The very recent discovery in the West of a new sub-discipline, entitled 'environmental sociology', is highly indicative of this and unwittingly signals the existence of a concept of society divorced from nature and in which sociological explanations were thought to be autonomous. When, however, one looks at social thought in Japan, China and India, and in particular those forms of thought rooted in Buddhism, Hinduism and to a lesser extent Shinto, a very different conception of human life in the universe begins to emerge. This broad conception has a number of elements. Firstly, that the funda mental uncertainty of life — its hazards and unpredictability (that have</page><page sequence="5">336 J. Clammer I Asian Journal ofSocial Science 37 (2009) 332—346 surfaced in Western social thought as the 'risk' analyses of Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas, amongst others) — has tended, in mainstream sociology, to generate 'systems' when, in fact, it should point us back to life itself and to the richness of the present moment. Existence is actually unknowable by analyti cal means and can only be grasped through other techniques that have not so far appeared in the vocabulary of sociology, including the meditative tech niques common to the religious traditions of Asia. Secondly, that the common assumptions of autonomy, independence and individualism that pervade Western thought make no sense from the perspective of Asian social psycholo gies which stress the interdependence of all entities, at the social level what the Vietnamese Buddhist thinker and activist Thich Nhat Hanh calls 'Interbeing' (Thich, 1998) and, at the ecological level, in the recognition of the fundamen tal embeddedness of humans in nature. The 'ecological self' announced by 'Deep Ecology' has, in fact, long been anticipated in Asian religious traditions. The self is not autonomous — it is the nexus of both socio-cultural forces and natural ones and the points at which these meet such as in the biological/ cultural heritage enshrined and celebrated in the notion of ancestors, so cen tral to East Asian religious and social practices. The recent invention in the West of 'ecopsychology' and the recognition of the deep scars that result from the artificial and, in fact, non-existent radical separation of humans and nature imposed on people by many aspects ut our industrial-urban civilisation, sig nals the belated re-emergence of a clearer and more modest perception of the place of humans in the cosmos as simply a part in a complex web of life and not necessarily as the apex of evolution. To overcome the illusion of separateness is the first step in a reinvented sociology. To say this is not to destroy the notion of the social, but to reconceptualise it. The social is necessary because it provides us with an inclusive path, the context of cultural interaction necessary to allow us to be most richly who we should really be. However, it is not the only or ultimate context of human life: we are also bodies and, as such, intimately connected to nature and its bio logical processes on which we are absolutely dependent and spirit, requiring, that is to say, a sense of meaning to our lives and their place in the total cos mos. The recognition of this multidimensional quality of human life funda mentally influences our conceptions of sociology and the society that it is supposed to describe and understand. As the modern Indian sage Sri Aurobindo puts it in relation to sociology: A spiritualised society would treat in its sociology the individual, from the saint to the criminal, not as units of social problems to be passed through some skilfully devised machinery and either flattened into the social mode or crushed out of it, but as souls suffering and entangled in a net and to be rescued, souls growing and to be encouraged</page><page sequence="6">J. Clammtr I Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 337 to grow. The aim of its economics would be not to create a huge engine of production, whether of the competitive or cooperative kind, but to give to men — not only to some but all men each in his highest possible measure — the joy of work according to their own nature and free leisure to grow inwardly, as well as a simply rich and beauti frd life for all... And that work would be to find the divine Self in the individual and the collectivity and to realise spiritually, mentally, vitally, materially its greatest, largest, richest and deepest possibilities in the inner life of all and their outer action and nature (Sri Aurobindo, 1962: 241-242). Expressed here in Neo-Hindu terms is a twofold notion — that the role of sociology is activist in a creative sense, that it is actually the art of assisting society to its highest self-realisation and that, as it were, society is greater than the social, or what Martin Fuchs has termed in more sociological language: 'the non-identity of society with itself' (Fuchs, 2004). By this is meant that 'society' is not an entity, but a process, a continuous self-becoming, an organism that is constantly reinventing itself. The failure to recognise this is reflected not only in the structure of conventional sociology textbooks where the chapter on 'social change' is typically added as a kind of afterthought, but in Fuchs' examples, in the treating of social movements as indeed just 'movements', rather than as experiments in meaning generation and as liberatory in intent, which is their true nature. Fuchs contends that, in the sociology of social movements, there is a constant confusion of the politi cal and the epistemological and of both with the ontological. The result is that a process of normalisation is fundamental to the sociological project and it is just this normalisation that in Fuchs' view must be transcended. This view is supported by the work of Alain Touraine who suggests that, "Social move ments are not exceptional and dramatic events: they lie permanently at the heart of social life... it is a fictitious belief that order comes first... what comes first is the work that society performs on itself" (Touraine, 1981: 29). For Touraine, this leads to the contention that, "Creation of a new order is the opposite of the conflict-loaded self-production of society" (Touraine 1985: 755), since social order, in fact, contains freedom and creativity and, as such, the possibility of self-transcendence. Whereas sociologists, sensing the limitations of their over-rationalist models, have turned in some numbers to the study of emotions, for the most part they have not yet turned to the study of the imagination, perhaps the most powerful human faculty. Yet, as Fuchs argues, building on some arguments of Johann Arnason (1989), imagi naries represent the non-identity of society with itself without the risk of con structing yet further meta-actors or macro-subjects while restoring agency to the individual, requiring an interactive approach to the study of culture and avoiding the serious over-determination of so much social science thinking (Unger, 2001).</page><page sequence="7">338 J. CLammer / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 This position has links to the work of anthropologists Marilyn Strathern and Nick Thomas that argues that 'society' is a provisional accomplishment rather than functional reproduction and that it is consequently necessary to move away from the older preoccupation with codes and systems to the study of practical enactments and improvisations. As Thomas suggests, what we have previously thought of as groups, cultures or collectivities are not in fact social aggregates, but 'images of unity', likely to be imagined episodically even though their elements may exist implicitly as memories, potentialities or sources of tensions. (Strathern, 1988; Thomas, 1997). The issue of the true nature of sociology, a very significant one since sociol ogy constructs and perpetuates images and models of society that are repro duced in policy, politics, personal self-images and, consequently, in individual and collective pathologies deriving from these images, is then at base essen tially a philosophical one. An inadequate model of knowledge necessarily gen erates problems, not only for what it includes, but equally for what it excludes. As the critical realism of Roy Bhaskar attempts to demonstrate as an alterna tive to the rationalist aridity of much mainstream Anglo-Saxon philosophy, the roles of self-realisation and spirituality in life are not marginal but lie at the centre of peoples' existential engagement with the indeterminacies at the heart of life, the elusiveness of existence and the role of 'chance' in shaping actual individual biographies and social change (Bhaskar, 2002). Similarly the phi losophy of Alain Badiou directly addresses the dual question of the nature of the 'social' as apparently structural (Durkheim's 'social facts') and the experi ential nature of human existence in which, ultimately, the singularity counts for more than the 'general' (Badiou, 2004). Anthropology and comparative sociology have for the most part not drawn the logical and theoretical conclu sions of their own empirical investigations — that there can be other sociali ties and modes of conviviality quite other than our own (Overing and Passes, 2000) and other ontologies that claim equal validity to the hegemonic West ern versions (Clammer et al., 2004) and with their surprisingly short historical memory have forgotten or marginalised the work of pioneers, such as Albion Small and many others, who had sketched the outlines of a holistic and open ended sociology which has since sunk out of sight under the hegemony of certain forms of institutionalised social science (Becker, 1971). Denial and Hope The ecological sociologist T. Athanasiou argued that, "We inhabit a paradox. Our age is tragic and catastrophe does threaten, but though the future is obscure, it does not come to us inexorable and inescapable. Our tragedy lies</page><page sequence="8">J. Clammer / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 339 in the richness of the available alternatives and the fact that so few of them are ever seriously explored" (Athanasiou, 1996: 306-307). For this reason, possible futures, whether posed in terms of civilisational dialogue, future stud ies, environmental sociology or development studies (which, despite its many shortcomings, does keep alive the major moral issues of the day and does place, even if unnamed as such, the problem of human suffering at its core), are as much the proper field of sociology as the analysis of the past or present. What is is not necessarily what has to be. The essential role of critical sociology — the exposure of our endless capacity for self-delusion and self justification — needs at this juncture in time to be extended into the anticipa tion and management of the very future that those institutional forms and cultural patterns that constitute the subject matter of conventional and func tionalist sociology have created and continue to create. As the American anthropologist Robert Murphy writes in his moving self-analysis of his own terminal illness, "The relationship between society and its symbolic standards for acting and evaluating, on the one hand, and the strivings and interests of ordinary people, on the other, are not neatly adjusted to each other and mutu ally supportive. Rather, the individual and culture are essentially in conflict, and history, instead of being the realisation of human intentions and cultural values, is commonly a contradiction of both" (Murphy, 1987:4). This strongly anti-Hegelian reading of history is indeed supported by many of the facts of our current situation. If modernity, as Zygmunt Bauman has argued (Bau man, 1999), culminated in the Holocaust, then our current civilisational pro cess, far from leading to the achievement of civility, has led to chaos, ecological meltdown, conflict, militarisation, unbridled consumption and terminal resource depletion. Sociology has, in fact, both underestimated the complexity of social pro cesses and their rootedness in biology (the body, mortality, health and illness), ecology and elaborate, but not fully articulated, meaning and creativity sys tems (of which formal religions and formal art are simply institutionalised expressions) and has overestimated the ability of sociologists to formulate true and accurate models of those processes. R. G. Dunn suggests that, "...the current state of the world in which we live has created a particular problem for social theorists... The dominant modes of theorising today are often unduly conditioned by the workings of contemporary culture itself, uncriti cally reproducing the basic structures, conditions and values of consumption society" (Dunn, 1998: 221). Postmodernism is an expression of this for with its emphasis on radical subjectivity, constructivism and the short attention span of media driven societies, it not only reflects the essentially hedonistic culture of consumption, but effectively denies both the possibility of existen tial universals — love, death, memory, meaning and belonging — but also of</page><page sequence="9">340 J. Clammer I Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 the ecological context within which all human life occurs. The ecological crisis has effectively shown up the shallowness of social theories abstracted from the larger planetary framework: our theories have simply been too small, too sim plistic and too anthropocentric to capture the reality that they purport to describe. They have also been too Eurocentric. When Douglas Ezzy writes that, in contrast to the radical anthropocentrism of most sociological theory, "The ecocentrism of the deep ecologists has many similarities with the hermeneuti cal theory of Gadamer, Charles Taylor and, to a lesser extent, Bauman. In this communitarian tradition, the starting point is not individuals, but relation ships" (Ezzy, 2004: 10), he is right and correct in pointing out that there is an alternative communitarian tradition in social thought. However, nowhere does he (nor any of the other major writers in environmental sociology that I am aware of) show any awareness of the existence of Asian, Native American or African sociologies and cosmologies in which the, in my view correct, announcement by Deep Ecologists of the notion of the ecological self' — a self formed and sustained not only by the web of social relationships identified by social psychology and socialisation theory, but equally of relationships, physical, cultural, economic, emotional and psychological, to nature (the foundational expression of this being [Arne Naess, 1988/1995], but with many subsequent elaborations [for an anthology of which, see Sessions, 1995]) was long anticipated and applied to a relational-, ecological- (often expressed in animistic terms) and emotions-based form of social thinking — in Japan, for example, in a very developed form (Clammer, 1995). We find here then a very interesting convergence between Asian sociologies and ideas emerging in particular out of Deep Ecology. These include an eco centric, rather than anthropomorphic, concept of the self and its place in the universe, a relational, rather than individualistic, understanding of socialisa tion and identity, a critique of industrial society's civilisational forms and cul ture and their destructive effects on resources and biodiversity, their spiritual aridity and their alienating effects on genuine human rootedness in the world. This is understood as due to the suppression by industrial society of both people's intimate relationship to nature and the existential problems that con front all cultures — the existence of suffering, evil and death on the one hand, and love, the search for authenticity and the irrepressible thirst for meaning expressed in art and forms of spirituality on the other. In Asian sociologies these elements can be found in differing ways in Bud dhism and especially in the forms of socially activist 'Engaged Buddhism' that have emerged in Asia and the West in the last decade or so (Queen et al., 2003) inspired by the work of such figures as A. T. Ariyaratne of Sri Lanka,</page><page sequence="10">J. Clammer I Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 341 Sulak Sivaraksa of Thailand, Thich Nhat Hanh of Vietnam and the Dalai Lama. Likewise in yet different configurations in contemporary Gandhian social thought (Kappen, 1990), the Confucian andTaoist traditions of China that have collectively been described as 'Chinese Humanism', the rediscovery of Shinto as an ecological religion (International Shinto Foundation, 1995), in attempts to define both Islamic economics and contemporary Islamic con ceptions of social justice and human rights (Qutb, 2000), and in Asian Chris tian theologies of liberation that have gone a long way towards both indigenising Christianity in Asian contexts and drawing out of it profound liberatory principles (Pieris, 1992; Wilfred, 2003). In each of these cases, the two central pillars of their social thought are religion and social justice. And while Islam and Christianity still lean towards an anthropocentric world view, the Buddhist, Shinto and Hindu traditions confirm the ecocentric view of identity espoused by western Deep Ecology. I have argued elsewhere (Clam mer, 2000) that a fundamental shortcoming of cultural theory is its lack of universality signalled by its failure to take the religious dimension of culture seriously (or at all) and, hence, to restrict itself to an impoverished version of human identity. Cultural theory is largely trapped in its own constructed notion of culture and this culturalism excludes any method for exploring humans relationship to both nature (one thinks of the radical opposition of nature/culture in major thinkers, such as Claude Levi-Strauss or Anthony Giddens), and to the transcendent, despite both being central to the ways in which actual human beings construct their maps of reality, their daily strate gies and their emotional geographies. For much conventional sociology, a preoccupation with methodology has driven out any concern with consciousness. As Alan Keightley puts it very aptly: "In what state of consciousness does the sociologist study other peoples states of consciousness?" He goes on to say that, "D. Z. Phillips [in Phillips, 1979] has argued forcefully to show how the sociologist offers us a persuasive, charming and dangerous story by impoverishing the mode of discourse it claims to analyse. He calls it the 'sociologising of meaning' and claims that it 'blinds us to other possibilities of meaning, and is both the agent and the product of the very alienation from which it claims to offer liberation'. It has unspoken, subterranean assumptions about the world" (Keightley, 1986: 152-153). The radical claim of Buddhism is, of course, on the one hand to relativise all such assumptions by showing them to be precisely that — if not strictly Maya (illusion) — then certainly contestable and largely unexamined and themselves culturally-received versions of the world and, on the other, to provide not a set of fixed answers, but rather a methodology for cutting through such illusions and finding a bedrock from which the world can be</page><page sequence="11">342 J. Clammer I Asian Journal ofSocial Science 37 (2009) 332-346 concretely known and the role of the mind in creating that world more fully understood. This then is the true sociology, of which the models and data of academic sociology are the epiphenomena. The world is not in fact in any way a fully calculable object, and to mistake the map for the ground, the concep tual description of the world for the world itself {ibid.: 167) is the fundamen tal illusion of the social sciences. In commenting on Marilyn Strathern's contention that, in arguing for the motion that the concept of society is theoretically obsolete, anthropological theories 'have exhausted themselves' (Strathern, 1990: 7), James F. Weiner suggests that, "Once we have agreed that anthropology's starting and ending points are the elucidation of social relationships, what then is our task? What kinds of problems are given us to solve against this grounding proposition? When I ask, in effect, 'What is left for us to say?' I am posing the following question: Against what epistemological limits will such a mode of questioning eventually run up? Such a question can only arise within the prior understand ing that although such limits are part of the subject matter, they are not directly addressed through its explanatory apparatus alone. A theory — that is, a mode of explanation — is a world, and a world cannot provide its own grounding... In other words, we want to specify the conditions under which the world is per ceived to be relationally based... prior to our analysis of if (Weiner, 2001: 70). Sociology and anthropology are consequently subject to their own rules of social inquiry, but to solve this by positing a 'sociology of sociology' is inade quate as this internal investigation proceeds on the same grounds as that which it examines. The fundamental question is that of the grounds of sociology and, hence, of the questions that it can legitimately ask. An oversocialised and over cuituralised notion of the self cannot provide the foundation for an adequate sociology of the real world, as the sociology óf the body demonstrates. In recovering the body as a subject of sociological investigation, this seeming advance is nullified by the very sociologising of the body that then occurs and, once again, the discourse is trapped within itself. Without a larger reference point — nature — upon which the self and body are, in fact, (even if unwit tingly) dependent a circular discourse is entailed; this is the fundamental problem of social/cultural theory— it has no reference point other than itself, and as such becomes not a system of explanation, but a self-referential system. It is little wonder then that attempts at social engineering and 'development' almost inevitably fail. As Roberto Calasso phrases it, "Around us there is an obstinate insistence on changing life, but without any specific notion of the facts of life" (Calasso, 1995: 24).</page><page sequence="12">J. Clammer / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 343 Beyond S elf-Referential! ty One of the ways out of this self-referentiality is, as suggested, to accept a notion of the ecological self, one which challenges social theory on the grounds of its paradoxically over-sociological view of human nature and of culture, and which dissolves the common distinctions between nature and society and the material and the symbolic (Lockie, 2004). A second one, significant in the context of the mostly left-leaning and materialist character of critical theory, is as also suggested above, the reinsertion of the recognition of the deeply sig nificant role of the spiritual in cultural studies, or as Ihab Hassan phrases it in the context of a sympathetic but critical assessment of postcolonial studies, "Is it not short-sighted, then, for postcolonial studies to ignore the radical imper atives of the human spirit?" (Hassan, 2002: 242), a possibility that allows him to explore both the role of Islam and of inter-civilisational dialogue: "Can divergent cultures also converge when their spiritual concerns meet... is it not likely that by understanding the spiritual dimensions in our own lives we can better understand, better translate, other lives" (ibid. 242-243). Several fresh or still unexplored directions then suggest themselves. These include a number of areas upon which sociology has indeed touched, but generally from a positivistic perspective. Such has been the case with both the sociology of the body and the emerging field of environmental sociology. The former, while liberating sociology from its over-cognitive and anti-somatic biases, has largely failed to link the body to nature or to the fundamental issue (central to any Buddhist approach to society) of suffering. In a way parallel to the literary critic Alvarez's insights into suicide, so the tragically autobiograph ical book by Robert F. Murphy (himself an anthropologist by profession) recording the progress of his own terminal illness and increasing disability, or that of the poet, critic and sometime professor of English, D. J. Enright (Enright, 2003) describing his own relationship to his terminal cancer, go far deeper than anything produced within the sociology of the body literature. They not only provide in Clifford Geertzs celebrated phrase, a 'thick descrip tion of illness and the bodily states associated with it, they also expose the frailty of the body, the uncertainties and sense of tenuousness that the body's daily functioning and even minor malfunctioning introduce into daily life its effects on moods, performance of even routine tasks, and above all, its mortal ity. While sociology has attempted to create a sociology of the body, o/litera ture, of art, or of the environment, it has learnt very little from the actual content of these subjects and their own special ways of confronting the world: sociology, itself, in other words, has learnt little from its subject matter while busily attempting to impose its own categories and explanations on that subject matter.</page><page sequence="13">344 J. Clammer I Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 332-346 Those dimensions of everyday life, vividly visible to those who actually live it, but apparently opaque to the sociologist, in fact provide the agenda of a true sociology that actually speaks of the fragility, mystery and temporality of life. In such a life the emotions, the body, nature, suffering, religion or some less codified form of spiritual expression and, as Overing and Passes have shown, what might be legitimately called the aesthetics of everyday life, are the real core. One anthropologist who has taken this seriously is Paul Stoller who writes that the social investigator has a responsibility: "This responsibility means that scholars seek ways of sensuously investigating, writing, and filming social life that enable the dead to live again and the living to recognise better ways of coping with the confusions of contemporary life. Is this not a burden worthy of future efforts to dwell in the embodied power of history?" (Stoller, 1997: 43). The founder of Deep Ecology, the Norwegian philosopher Ame Naess, in an early essay (Naess, 1973/1995), contrasted what he called the shallow approach of conventional, reformist environmentalism with all its compro mises with the resource extraction industries and its wholly anthropocentric approach which sees nature simply as a place for recreation for humans and as a source of medicines or other benefits equally for humans and with no intrin sic value in itself, and the approach of Deep Ecology which takes a biocentric approach, expands the concept of the self to include its deep dependence on and interconnectedness with nature and recognises the rights of other living entities to be allowed to live and evolve in peace. In a similar way in this essay, I am contrasting what I find to be the existential shallowness, culturalism and anthropocentrism of conventional sociology with the possibility of a rich and transforming engagement with the issues and approaches to life that artists, spiritual seekers, poets and deep ecologists have long pioneered and the absence of which is both the source of so much of the aridity of sociology and the crises that global society and environment now confront. The materials for this reconstruction lie all around us — in those visions of the world just enu merated, in the works of those significant, but marginalised, thinkers men tioned earlier in this essay and in the works of many others like them, and in the possibility that art and nature are not passive subjects of analysis, but the carriers of valid knowledge, and as such, like the many forms of indigenous knowledge supposedly the subject matter of anthropology, ways of seeing and acting in and on the world. As the theologian and ecologist Thomas Berry puts it, that in the context of our present crisis and the extraordinary denial that surrounds it, "We must recognise that the only effective programme avail able as our primary guide toward a viable human mode of being is the pro gramme offered by the Earth itself" (Berry, 1999: 71). The responsibility of sociology, as with the other social sciences, is to grasp that challenge.</page><page sequence="14">/.
