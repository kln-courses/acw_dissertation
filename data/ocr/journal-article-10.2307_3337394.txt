<plain_text><page sequence="1">ex h i b i t i o n p r e v i ew Art of the Baga A Drama of Cultural Reinvention FREDERICK LAMP urated by Frederick Lamp, "Art of the Baga" is the first major traveling exhibition to present the artistic legacy of this Guinean people. It offers a broad range of artworks-from headdresses and masks in full costume to small, embellished personal objects-to illustrate how the Baga have maintained their cultural traditions despite a history of religious and political oppression and foreign incursions. The exhibition is organized and presented by the Museum for African Art, New York, in cooperation with the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Lamp is Curator of the Arts of Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. It is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, and HALCO (Mining) Inc., Pittsburgh. Originating in New York (October 4, 1996-January 5, 1997), "Art of the Baga" will be on view in Baltimore (January 29-April 20, 1997) before beginning its international tour. The exhibition is accompanied by a publication written by Frederick Lamp, with contributions by Sekou Beka Bangoura, Adolphe Camara, P.E.H. Hair, Djibril Tamsir Niane, "The Baga Youth," and forty Baga consultants (256 pp., 250 b/w &amp; color illustrations, $75 hardcover, $40 softcover). Opposite page: 1.

M aybe it was the (always) immortal words of William Fagg that I read so long ago: Among the art-producing tribes of Negro Africa the Baga of the coastal area of what was till recently French Guinea must be accounted one of the most important and at the same time obscure. (in the British Museum Quarterly, 1961:61) Or maybe it was that enormous, inscrutable image of a soaring, slender, beaked head and breasts merging onto four legs, the great "Nimba," that I must have seen somewhere, perhaps in the Baltimore Museum of Art, perhaps in a book. The intrigu- ing abstraction of forms seemed to minimalize the human body while at the same time making it larger than life. Perhaps it was the couple of Baga families living elusively down a hidden path near my village in Sierra Leone where I was a Peace Corps teacher. I never saw them in two years of residence, yet I heard the Temne villagers speak of them curiously, as a sort of "country cousins" who slurred their words (for example, tshol instead of the crisper tsol [medicine] of the Temne). Later, in my first course on African art, each student was to select an ethnic group to study. Before the professor reached me, another student had chosen the Baga, to my dismay, and I quickly changed my choice to the Temne. I eventually went on to do my dissertation on the Temne, but I never lost my curiosity about the Baga. After years of Guinean isolationism, and a coup d'etat in 1984, I was finally granted my longstand- ing wish: a visa to Guinea. Thus began, in 1985, my personal involvement with and study of the Baga in situ, resulting a decade later in the current exhibition at the Museum for African Art. "Art of the Baga: A Drama of Cultural Reinvention" began innocently enough as one art historian's attempt to quietly document the culture of an "other." But I quick- ly discovered that it wasn't to be so. My Guinean research associates and I soon became enmeshed in a drama that had been unfolding for centuries on a larger scale and, again, in microcosm in the few years that we spent among the Baga. Always the masters of improvisation and self-preservation, the Baga seized an opportunity, pro- vided by the presence of emissaries from the government of Guinea and from the gov- ernment of the United States (I came with U.S. government grants), to involve us in an agenda that exceeded all our modest expectations. alrican arts autumn 1996 mC z m0 40 8 mc 0 m m? c z 0 z C) m U) r. c co m? m U) z A xc 20</page><page sequence="2">-~~~~~~~~~~~ ?- |?i D:2&gt;^ : :' Ve : 0 ,r :mE g f &lt;,Qi-~~~~~~~~~~~~?j;4 Sq</page><page sequence="3">african arts autumn 1996 22</page><page sequence="4">The watershed that made the Baga what they are today began just before independence, in 1956-57. Two Muslim mis- sionaries from the Mande then entered northern Baga territo- ry in the districts of Boffa and Boke and literally destroyed most of what had been left of ritual life following several decades of slow Islamic growth. Accompanied by hundreds of disenchanted Baga youth and others, and with the blessing of the dominant political party of soon-to-be president Sekou Toure, they ransacked each village and each private residence, ostensibly plundered the entire stock of ritual material, cut down the sacred forests, and tortured anyone opposing the total conversion to Islam. In the period of independence to fol- low, under the new, precariously Marxist-Islamic Republic of Guinea, traditional religious practices were declared illegal and carried severe penalties for transgressors, although some secular dance, even with costumes, continued. I was told that Baga ritual had become largely defunct (at least publicly) since independence. Indeed, I found that few people under fifty years of age had any recollection of tradi- tional ritual, and those who had been versed in esoteric knowl- edge at the time of the ritual demise were now well into the eighth decade or beyond. No one remained, of course, who would have had the insights of a ritual elder when practice was current. Under these circumstances it was almost impossible at first to observe traditional ritual, and most of our information was obtained through interviews. There were two exceptions. Under a new government since 1984, the Baga had cautiously started to rebuild their ethnic pride and unity among all their diverse dialect groups. Through the collaboration of both young, edu- cated Baga and a few elderly guardians of the traditions, the reconstruction of some aspects of pre-Islamic Baga culture and the production of art had begun (Figs. 2-4). In the two excep- tions we found to the destruction of traditional ritual, it appears that the ritual had continued in some very private form in specific locations, but now was being practiced openly. In one village, among the Baga Sitemu subgroup, a ritual practitioner still maintained a shrine dedicated to medical healing, containing objects of traditional art (Fig. 5). In a second village, among the Bulufiits (Baga Fore), the dances of an initiation for adult women were in progress in the sacred grove just as we arrived (similar to Fig. 6). Otherwise, little pre-Islamic culture was evident, and the rather aus- tere atmosphere fostered by the imams was in force everywhere. Enter into this somewhat bleak but volatile cultural scene the American researcher with the proposed project on the "Ritual Arts of the Baga." In order to travel to do research outside the capital city, one was required at that time to be accompanied by a "collaborator" from the government. Circumstances were such that several others would join us, such as an elderly sponsor, an interpreter, a driver or boatman and their apprentices, and often a local attache or two. To depart on the research tour, one had to obtain "Ordres de Mission" from the Ministry of Information and Culture. These documents, signed by the Minister, were to be signed by the prefet at each district head- quarters, and then presented for signature to the sous-prefet of each subordinate area and finally to the chief of each village. Without strict adherence to this policy, no coop- eration could be expected from the village administrators or their residents. With this procedure followed, one would be received with all the deference given a visiting gov- ernment dignitary, and all activities and requests would be regarded as official, autho- rized at the highest level. Thus was our team of often six or seven persons received in the villages. Our Baga hosts referred to us as a delegation. Many Baga saw our presence as an official message authorizing the revival of traditional custom. Incredibly, one by one, certain Baga representatives advanced the idea that their vil- lage should organize reenactments of traditional ritual events as they existed up to the 1950s, and in the spirit of competition, the idea spread. Our knowledge of Baga ritual was consequently greatly enhanced by opportunities to witness and videotape the Opposite page, clockwise from top left: 2. Dance of Banda, Baga Mandori subgroup.

It endowed the elders' drum with a supernatural authority. response to my suggestion resulted rather in an overwhelming proposal of major pro- portions from the villagers themselves, who seemed eager to revive their own traditions and saw my presence and encouragement as a way to do it. In each of these villages, elders spent time teaching young people the dance steps, drummers and singers were tutored, carvers carved new masks, existing masks were refurbished, young people con- structed new costumes, and generally a majority of the villagers turned out to produce a spectacle of music and dance that re-created the traditions of the past (Fig. 7). By com- paring the features of movement and sculptural form from one village to the next where dances were repeated, we could get a good sense of what was generally traditional, what was local peculiarity, and what was new interpretation. In addition to specific masked dances, entire ritual sequences were reconstructed, including the coming-out of boys from their initiation and the week-long marriage ceremonies for a young woman. Toward the end of our stay in 1987, a sacrificial event was held to which all Baga were invited. Involving masked and costumed dance and an initiation into a secret soci- ety for adult men, the event, lasting three days, followed a tradition formerly held every three years that had been abandoned for three decades. We were permitted to observe all the dances in the village and the sacred grove, but not the initiation procedure. There is no question that the research project, high in national publicity, executed with an entourage of Guineans of some position, and mixed with signed authorizations of every sort, was the catalyst that enabled this important event to be renewed. All this has offered a unique opportunity to study firsthand a people's reinvention of its past. The construction of a new culture based upon things no longer a part of the Baga experience draws upon a variety of resources. The principal resource is the mem- ory of the elders, certainly filtered through decades (in some cases, a century) of expe- riences: two world wars; the French colonization; European education; the coming of the airplane, motor vehicle, and motion picture; and the departure of their grandchil- dren to the city, among others. Some reconstruction occurs through the maintenance of a few oral traditions passed on to the young people. Since 1985, with access to my photo african arts . autumn 1996 24</page><page sequence="6">albums, carvers have been exposed to published works of art that now lie out- side their domain, in private and muse- um collections in the West. And the entire society, from elders to the youth, is en- gaging in a new introspection about its national and ethnic identity. Because of this background, I began to see that there were many perspectives on Baga cultural history within the Baga community. In constructing plans for the Baga exhibition and catalogue, I also began to see that perspectives within the scholarly community were so diverse as to be irreconcilable. It occurred to me that not only was this much in keeping with the historic obscurity of the Baga them- selves, but also it was as it should be. No singular story could give a true sense of the Baga experience-not that of the intransigent Baga gerontocracy, not that of the educated Baga youths, not that of the British historian, nor of the Guinean ethnohistorian, nor my own. I decided to turn the book and exhibition over to indi- vidual voices, primarily Baga but includ- ing outside observations, organized to tell a drama that I had perceived in years of fieldwork, archival research, and the search for Baga objects throughout muse- ums and private collections of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The result is, I hope, a conversation between persons of diverse backgrounds about a history in which all had been observers and partic- ipants to one degree or another. Along the way, many people were in- volved in planning for "Art of the Baga" and contributed to the shape the exhibi- tion and catalogue eventually took. Susan Vogel, then director of the Museum for African Art, initially suggested that we organize the text and exhibition design as a "drama," drawing upon an excitement she and the other consultants felt was generated by a history of such turbulence and resilience. Djibril Tamsir Niane, re- tired professor of history at the University of Conakry, encouraged us to include the Guinean voice and to engage the Baga themselves, from the very beginning of planning through to the exhibition instal- lation and programs. Paul Hair, president of the Hakluyt Society and retired profes- sor of history at the University of Liverpool, urged us to carefully weigh the social construction of oral narrative and the limitations of European documenta- tion. Mary Jo Arnoldi, curator of African ethnology at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., was concerned that we see Baga cultural development as self- inspired and creative as much as derived african arts autumn 1996 25</page><page sequence="7">Left: 9.

"Art of the Baga" is the first exhibition of the art of these people, so well known yet so poorly understood. Though they are a relatively small ethnic group, the Baga have produced an impressive body of art widely acclaimed for its magnificence, monu- mental scale, variety of forms, and complex abstraction. Studied by such artists as Picasso and Giacometti, Baga art has had a significant impact on twentieth-century art of the West. This artistic legacy is all the more remarkable for having endured through centuries of incursions by foreign peoples and ideas, evolving and surviving despite a rigorous suppression of Baga religious practices that intensified during the last half of this century. Although the Baga are mentioned in documents dating back to the fif- teenth century, no published monograph on them has ever appeared prior to the cata- logue for this exhibition. The research represented in that book provides the first in-depth look at Baga art as a corpus. The exhibition explores Baga art history through the display of over one hundred of the finest and most visually exciting works in collections in the United States and Europe. Objects date from possibly the eighteenth to the twentieth century and include masks and headdresses (Figs. 9,10), shrine pieces (Fig. 11), immense figurative drums (Cover, Fig. 8), human figures (Figs. 12, 13), baskets, pottery, furniture, and utilitarian objects (Fig. 14). Artworks have been selected to represent the broadest range of forms, media, regional origins, ages, and styles. Gender was also a critical criterion for selection in terms of artis- tic representation, the identity of the artist, and the identity of the user and patron. c1 tic representation, the identity of the artist, and the identity of the user and patron. african arts autumn 1996 26</page><page sequence="8">AGENCE PHOTOGRAPHIQUE DE LA REUNION DES MUStES NATIONAUX Interpretive materials in the exhibition give the Baga first right of parol, engaging the direct testimony of respected traditional leaders, now-elderly reformers who were active in the 1950s, children, writers, educators, artists, performers, and acknowledged spokespersons. Outside viewpoints include those of colonial administrators, mer- chants, and missionaries dating back to the mid-fifteenth century; the recent work of anthropologists, historians, and ethnohistorians; and, of course, my own contempo- rary art-historical fieldwork. The Baga are demographically one of the smallest ethnic groups in the Republic of Guinea, occupying scattered pockets of land along the Atlantic coast, largely inacces- sible by motor vehicle during much of the year. They are surrounded inland by the Susu people, one of the three major ethnic groups in Guinea, each speaking a discrete language. Further inland, the Fulbe occupy most of the highlands known as the Fouta Djallon, and the Malinke cover a vast savanna beyond, stretching into most of the neighboring countries. Other small groups share the Atlantic coast, including the Landuma and Nalu to the north of the Baga, and the Mmani to the south. The people known today as the Baga actually include five Baga dialect groups and two completely unrelated, small language units, Pukur and Bulufits (known to out- siders as Baga Binari/Mboteni and Baga Fore). All live on the marshy coast. Their eth- nohistory begins in the mountainous Fouta Djallon, some 150-400 kilometers inland, an area of high rocky escarpments, vast, grassy plateaus, plunging waterfalls, dense forests, and moderate climate, recalled fondly through oral narratives. According to the Baga, in a resolute attempt to resist conversion to Islam by the incoming Fulbe, their ancestors migrated to the coast, carrying with them their most revered male spir- 11.

The ancestors of the Baga are documented on the coast as early as 1500 (as "Sapi," identified as Baga no earlier than 1573). No documents exist to support a Baga habita- tion in the Fouta Djallon or a subsequent migration to the coast. The people's ethno- historical accounts are centered on this premise, however, and the migration in particular is integral to their social organization. It is the sequence of the Baga arrival on the coast that defines 1) which village belongs to which version of the highest male spirit, a-Mantsho-fo-P6n, and 2) which clan belongs to which moiety, identified by allegiance to either a-Mantsho-fio-Pon or a-Bol (for the feminine moiety), for the Baga Sitemu, and to male and female versions of the Serpent spirit, a-Mantsho-fia-Tshol (Fig. 15), for other Baga groups. On the coast, the Baga claim to have generated a number of spiritual "ideas" and to have "invented" or "discovered" an impressive variety of spiritual beings which they made manifest in spectacular and monumental forms of art. A-Bol, the female com- panion of the highest male spirit among the Baga Sitemu, was discovered at an Atlantic beach site after the migration and was manifested by Baga artists in the form 28 atrican arts autumn 1990 28 african arts - autumn 1996</page><page sequence="10">COURTESY OF THE AFRIKA MUSEUM, BERG EN DAL Left: 15.

The most beloved of all Baga female masquerades, D'mba, known to collectors as Nimba (Figs. 1, 16), is said to have been "invented" after the arrival on the coast to express notions of the ideal woman, to give form to Baga aspirations, and to bring happiness to the Baga, so recently displaced from their homeland in the mountains. Historical documents confirm incursions by larger and more unified, imperialistic groups from the sixteenth through the twentieth century, wreaking havoc not only upon the Baga but upon all the small non-Islamic groups on the coast. The Susu intro- duced and controlled markets, dominating linguistically and introducing Islam (as they themselves were Islamized by the Fulbe). The Fulbe instituted an impassioned Islamic jihad in the early eighteenth century, and have, even up to the present, direct- ly confronted the Baga, with whom, coincidentally, they have long competed for cat- tle-grazing land. The powerful and extensive Malinke Empire of the twelfth to fifteenth century must have exerted its political hegemony, and in the twentieth, the Malinke led the coerced Islamic conversion of the Baga. Still, the Baga defied their geographic and political fragmentation through ritual unity-centralized initiations, sacrifices, harvest festivals, and other ritual-as well as through itinerant performance. Art often functioned to fortify their ethnicity and offered a formidable defense against the encroachment of more powerful neighbors as well as control over myriad natural forces. The memory of the a-Mantsho-fio-Pon mas- querade, for example, still inspires enormous fear, dread, and awe among the neigh- bors of the Baga. From 1895, the French began instituting colonial control over Guinea. In the early twentieth century they replaced the existing political structure of the Baga, installing a system of chiefs in place of the traditional council of elders, and undermining the rit- ual order. They also made such a demand for art objects that by mid-century few of the old masks and ritual sculpture remained. As a result, however, Baga art began to affect developments in European art. The gigantic D'mba (Nimba) headdress (Fig. 1) is prob- ably one of the best-known objects of African art in the West and the most copied by Western artists, including Picasso (who owned one), Giacometti, and, most recently, Fred Wilson. Artists have also shown interest in the serpent headdress (Fig. 15), bird- head shrine figure (Fig. 11), bird-figure headdress (Fig. 19), and other objects. The prolific period of Baga art production and use ended in 1956-57, as mentioned above, when the people were brutally forced to convert en masse to Islam through a jihad organized by Malinke zealots, capitalizing upon a groundswell of discontent among Baga youth. Independence from France came in 1958, bringing the Malinke to national power at the head of the new republic. One of the first acts of this new gov- ernment was to institute a national program of "demystification" whereby ritual prac- titioners were required to divulge their secrets, and with this the practice of indigenous Guinean religious traditions throughout the country was declared illegal and punish- 30 atrlcan arts . autumn 1996 30 alrican arts -autumn 1996</page><page sequence="12">able by law. Little underground ritual was sustained, although ritual leaders held some fundamentals in reserve. Consulting scholars have suggested that the Baga respons- es to some universal concerns are close to unique, particularly in regard to oppression and disorientation. The leitmotif of the exhibition is the mechanisms used by the Baga in dealing resiliently with some unfortunate contingencies not of their own making, with a focus on the function of art as a personal and societal response to political change. An example of such resilience is the creation of the head- dresses known as Sibondel and al-B'rak. Sibondel appeared in the 1930s as a box with a hare head (Fig. 20); it symbolized Baga agility and cunning in negotiating danger at a time when the Malinke political and religious threat was beginning to affect them. From the late 1940s, the headdress incorporated figures representing the largely Malinke Guinean elite of mid- century: Muslim teachers, military men, white-robed govern- ment ministers, and the elephant-symbol of the ruling Malinke-dominated political party-enabling the Baga youth to identify with the progressive movement of the time while subverting it to their own goals. In 1955, with the forces of Islam threatening to sweep the country, a variation of the Sibondel form was invented by a carver named Salo Baki. He named it after an image he saw in a newspaper: "al-B'rak," the winged horse that miraculously carried Mohammed to the sky. The winged horse was trans- formed into the head of a Baga man, bearing Baga scarification marks and a Muslim cap (Fig. 21). Al-B'rak, like many Baga art forms, offers for study numerous aspects of the reinvention of culture, including artistic choices and their societal acceptance, modification of traditional art forms, synthesis of new reli- gious ideology, appropriation of popular culture, and accom- modation of political contingencies. Artistic creation and re-creation form the core of specific issues that are raised throughout the exploration of the Baga art historical drama, especially illuminated in the events and the research of the past decade. Central to this discussion is the rather startling revelation in field interviews with traditional leaders that the Baga view their spiritual world as a cultural artifact, a world created by human beings. This anthropocentric view is curious for a people of faith, particularly the ritual elite, to articulate about the objects of their own beliefs. It is, in fact, an anthropological view. It suggests a stratification of knowl- edge in which older classes control access by the younger, and also a strong belief in the power of human creations. It also car- ries extraordinary implications regarding the role of the artist as an agent of change. Consultants to this exhibition suggest this view may be unique to the Baga, and, except for some ref- erences to conflicting levels of knowledge, there seems to be no other current literature on this phenomenon. The manipulation and acquisition of culture by children and the youth are a central theme of the exhibition. Baga chil- dren create their own ritual societies and invent their own masquerades, which they call to-lom, "sacred things," some of which resemble the forbidden high spirit. They seem not sim- ply to mimic the elders, but also to manipulate the cultural information received and reinvent its forms, giving new mean- ing to the definition of "tradition." Baga society is composed of age grades, and the system of control is at once guided and also compromised by the concept of the rights of "older broth- er" and "younger brother" known better among the inland Manding. This means that a struggle between the imagery of elders maintaining control and the youth defying the same has characterized Baga society throughout its history (Fig. 3). african arts autumn 1996 31</page><page sequence="13">Above: 19.

"Art of the Baga" is unusual because of the active way in which Baga leaders participated with me as guest curator in the research process, creating research opportunities and directing the course of the inquiry, much_ a , tand in the planning of the exhibition, helping to shape the presentation of themselves. Also unusual is the way in which my work, in turn, has become so directly pressed into the service of their social agenda. The Baga clearly view my study of their art history in the context of a Baga cultural (and, by corollary, politi- cal) renaissance. They have participated in the planning of the exhibition and cat- alogue as both an instrument and man- ifesto of that renaissance, hoping to inspire self-pride and national as well as international recognition. "Art of the Baga" and its companion monograph address not only the Baga adjustment to political and social contingencies again in effect in the renewal of the 1990s, but also the role and responsibilities of the researcher in response. The visitor to an exhibition of African art is often somewhat deceived about the nature of the art and the original inten- tion of the artist because of both the installation and selection of objects. The object on display is typically but a small fragment of the original art form as it was conceived by the artists and their audi- ences. This original form consists of music, dance, costuming, and an archi- tectural environment, among many other elements. Students of African art today are aware that African art is an integrated form, yet the fragment as it continues to be treated in museum exhibitions and in uni- versity lectures is still regarded as if it were the art form. Often, in fact, our fragment is the least important element. In "Art of the Baga" we have tried to explore the ways in which such a deception might be redressed. The exhibition has been designed in a manner that suggests, as much as possible, the fullest artistic context of the objects. Though the issues that are addressed also investigate how the art functions in a social context, the focus is specif- ically on the art form itself as a context for the museum fragment. Through mounting and lighting, costuming, color photography, and audio and video presentations, we have attempted to fill the void in the space of individual display either by inference or direct augmentation. The exhibition is organized in five sections following the theme of "A Drama of Cultural Reinvention," in chronological order: 1) Legacy of the Fouta Djallon, 2) Invention and Discovery from Early Settlement, 3) the Colonial Watershed, 4) the Islamic Watershed, and 5) the Present Dilemma. Each period is defined by the inven- tion, discovery, or development of objects, as well as the continuation and transition of objects from past periods. A work chosen to represent a particular era in Baga art his- tory does not necessarily date in manufacture from that time (which would be an antiquity of at least 500 years or more for the first period). For example, most of the pieces chosen to represent the current period actually date from the early and mid- twentieth century, since works from the past ten years are largely still in indigenous use and not available for loan. The exhibition groupings deal with object types which would have been current within the respective eras. african arts autumn 1996 32</page><page sequence="14">On the level of sheer aesthetic pleasure, "Art of the Baga" offers an incomparable feast. Representing the legacy of the Fouta Djallon are a soaring vertical serpent (a- Mantsho-fa-Tshol) from the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, used in Baga ritual as a dance headdress; an elephant tusk drum from the Afrika Museum, Berg en Dal (Fig. 17); a shrine figure (a-Tshol) consist- ing of a human head with long beak, placed upon a globular support, from the National Museum of African Art, Wash- ington, D.C.; and a huge horizontal head- dress representing composite zoomorphic and anthropomorphic elements (Banda) from the Baltimore Museum of Art (Fig. 9). Forms demonstrating the spectacular invention of the Baga attributed by them to the period following migration to the coast include a monumental female dance headdress (D'mba/Nimba) from the Musee d'Histoire Naturelle, Toulouse; an exquisite small figure of a seated woman collected in 1855, from the Musee des Beaux Arts, Poitiers; a caryatid drum (a- ndf) used by the married women's associ- ation, from the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren; and an immense drum carved with the support of a deco- rated horse (timba) used by adult men, from the Musee des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie, Paris (Fig. 8). From the colonial period, works which may have been produced earlier but con- tinued to be used include a female bust headdress (Zigiren-Wonde) of the south- ern Baga, from the Brooklyn Museum, and many other older objects. Works cre- ated during this period include a large box headdress representing a hare with fig- ures (Sibondel), from the Appleton Mu- seum of Art, Ocala, Florida (Fig. 20); and a headdress representing a female spirit (Yonbofissa), from the Hood Museum, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hamp- shire. The period of Islamization is rep- resented by a flying horse headdress (al-B'rak) from the UCLA Fowler Muse- um of Cultural History, Los Angeles (Fig. 21); a caryatid stool from the Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, Alabama; and an equestrian female figure used as a dance headdress from the collection of Gene L. Isaacson, Santa Ana, California. The final section, representing the types of works continuing to appear today in the cultural renewal, include a bird headdress (a-Bamp) from the collection of Silvie and Marceau Riviere, Paris; a bust headdress representing a maiden (Sa-Sira-Ren) from the Volkerkundemuseum der Universitat Zurich (Fig. 18); and a female bust head- dress (Zigiren-Wonde) from the Metro- politan Museum of Art, New York.
