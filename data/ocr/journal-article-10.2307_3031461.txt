<plain_text><page sequence="1">by LLOYD GOODRICH associate director of the Whitney Museum of American Art and author of THOMAS EAKINS: His LIFE AND WORK. The Painting of American History: 1775 to 1900 THE picturing of historical and social subjects is a branch of art in which documentary and artistic values are combined in varying pro- portions. Much art of this kind is largely historical in interest and with- out much distinction as art. On the other hand, some of the best from an artistic standpoint is quite misleading as history. But now and then both sets of qualities combine to produce a historical document which is also a work of art. Such works have a special fascination, because beyond the immediate pleasure they give us as art, lies a wide world of social meaning. It is axiomatic that great subjects do not necessarily create great art. Indeed, they have produced some of the worst as well as some of the best art. In the plastic arts, content is not as all-important as in prose literature. The artist is an unaccountable creature, who can use the most unlikely material-Rembrandt's butcher shop, Chardin's pots and pans, Cezanne's apples and tablecloths. He is never primarily a philosopher, historian, or social commentator. He is a creator who uses all aspects of the visible world to build works of art. He paints best what lies within his own sensory experience, what stirs him visually and emotionally, and what can be expressed in pictorial terms. The Christian religion and classic mythology offered him unlimited oppor- tunities, for their legends were anthropomorphic and could be rep- resented in human form. In comparison, history is an impersonal kind of subject matter. How can a painter represent pictorially the Federal Constitution? He can paint portraits of its makers, or scenes of the Constitutional Convention; but the great political structure itself is something for the historian and not for the artist. Only when history 283</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN QUARTERLY is embodied in visible form can it be used by the artist. What he gives us is the way things looked, the visual aspect of historical events, the occasions when historic forces were embodied in great personages or situations. Hence historical art inclines towards the personal and the dramatic. And hence the fact, disconcerting as it may be, that much of the best of it is military. Historical art can be divided into two main types: contemporary history, and reconstruction of past history. In Western painting the latter type has predominated and has produced more art of the first rank. Until comparatively modern times, the past was considered worthier of representation than the present. Leonardo's and Michel- angelo's great battle compositions in Florence were of past years. Velasquez's "Surrender of Breda" was one of the few great Renaissance paintings which was a factual record of the artist's own time. But the momentous political upheavals of the late eighteenth century, especially the American and French Revolutions, brought a new interest in con- temporary subjects. West and Copley in England, Goya in Spain, David and Gros and others of the Napoleonic school in France, and later the romantics G6ricault and Delacroix, made contemporary history a respected form of art. Retrospective history, however, still continued its predominance; even David painted Greece and Rome more than his own period. Art needs time to assimilate the tremendous themes of contemporary history and make them usable, just as it needs time to assimilate technological changes; there was little good painting of industrial subjects during the Industrial Revolution. And even with this time-lag, great historical art requires special gifts. Too often pictorial reconstructions of the past, like most historical novels, are costume pieces without the breath of life. And the more skillfully they are done, the worse they are-witness Meissonier and G~r6e. On the other hand, a contemporary pictorial record, if the artist has any talent, will have the authenticity and immediacy of something actually seen and experienced. In colonial America an overwhelming proportion of painting was portraiture. The colonials were too busy settling the new continent, with too little margin of wealth and leisure, and at least in New England too restricted by Puritanism, to support religious or classic art, history, genre, or landscape. Historical art in particular requires official patron- age; but the colonies had no centralized state, no royal court, and little cultivated aristocracy. Portraiture was the only kind of art which private individuals of wealth and social position considered necessary. In the words of the English exponent of the grand style, Benjamin Robert Haydon: "Portraiture is always independent of art and has 284</page><page sequence="3">THE PAINTING OF AMERICAN HISTORY little or nothing to do with it. It is one of the staple manufactures of the Empire. Wherever the British settle, wherever they colonize, they carry, and will always carry, trial by jury, horse racing and portrait painting." It was abroad, in the London studio of Benjamin West, that the first school of American historical painting was born. West, American by birth but European by training, official court painter to George III, nevertheless remained American in his sympathies. In subject matter he was an innovator, picturing contemporary history before David and Gros, and using contemporary dress instead of the classical costumes considered de rigueur at the time. His large canvases in the grand style are conscientious rather than inspired adaptations of the old masters, theatrical in sentiment and conventional in composition. Nevertheless a work like his "Death of General Wolfe" was not only an innovation in subject but still remains one of the most impressive paintings of American history. John Singleton Copley, colonial America's greatest portraitist, did not realize his lifelong ambition to paint history until he had settled in London. Copley's huge historical compositions carried on West's precedent of contemporary history, but with a vitality and a sense of character surpassing West. Since their subjects were British, they lie outside our field; but it is interesting that these two American-born painters were leaders of the British historical school. Through West's hospitable studio passed most of the younger American painters who attempted history. From there Charles Willson Peale came home to play an active part in the Revolutionary War and to make his important record of the leaders of that heroic age, in portraits which sometimes represented them in historic actions and settings. It was under West's teaching that John Trumbull, after serving briefly in the Revolutionary armies, painted his first scenes of the Revolution, in which he pictured high moments in that struggle with a dramatic intensity and a true epic quality that make them the finest American historical paintings in the grand style. Trumbull was the first painter in America who consciously attempted to make a career of historical art. To this end he painted many versions of his early Revolutionary subjects, and tried to persuade the federal government to commission them on a large scale. But our government had advanced little beyond the colonial governments in recognition of art; and by the time Trumbull finally secured commissions for the four large wall paintings in the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington, his youthful fire was gone; the results have little of the vitality of the small London versions. Trumbull was the first and most conspicuous case of an 285</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN QUARTERLY artist with gifts for more than portraiture who failed to realize them because of America's cultural limitations. Two other examples of this failure were John Vanderlyn and Samuel F. B. Morse. Vanderlyn, trained in Paris by a pupil of David, aspired to establish over here a school of American historical painting like the Napoleonic one, but ended as an embittered provincial portraitist. Morse, who had learned the grand style in London under the influence of West and Washington Allston, combined it with a fresh, vigorous naturalism. His fine canvas of "The Old House of Representatives" is a contemporary record of the first importance both historically and artistically. But he found no encouragement for such ambitious sub- jects, and after years of painting some of the best portraits ever pro- duced in America, he abandoned art for invention. Thus ended the first noble attempt to found an American school of historical painting in the grand style. The United States was still a small semicolonial nation, without the long annals out of which a school of historical art could grow. The American people, matter-of- fact, liking the familiar, the sentimental and the humorous, were un- prepared for epic or imaginative art. The necessary official support, either governmental or aristocratic, was lacking. The American art world was that of a provincial middle-class democracy. The principal art patron was the wealthy bourgeois, who preferred portraits, land- scape, or genre to hang in his home. For some time to come, portraiture was to remain the only sure way of making a living. While Trumbull, Vanderlyn, and Morse found little encouragement for their historical works, Gilbert Stuart's and Rembrandt Peale's innumerable portraits of Washington were money in the bank. When public taste finally broadened in the 1820's and 1830's, it turned towards more familiar fields than heroic history. The neoclassic era was passing; the two predominant trends of the new century in America were to be roman- ticism and realism. The favorite types of subject, aside from portraiture, were to be landscape and the picturing of daily life. Since West and his school, the annals of American historical painting have been fragmentary. Such pictures were painted, but they were the occasional works of artists whose chief work lay in other fields. There were no outstanding individuals producing historical art, and no historical school in the sense that there were schools of portraiture, landscape, and genre. On the other hand, many historical subjects were pictured by lesser-known artists or amateurs. The latter were often explorers, travelers, sailors, soldiers, or foreign visitors-people close to the events, who happened to have a talent for drawing. It is remarkable how often, when history was being made, there was some- 286</page><page sequence="5">THE PAINTING OF AMERICAN HISTORY one present who could sketch it-just as today there is always someone with a camera. Usually the value of such records is historical rather than artistic; they bear somewhat the same relation to art as journalism or diaries do to history. But often, in historical societies or in such exhibitions as the Metropolitan Museum's "Life in America" of 1939 or the Corcoran Gallery's "American Processional" of 1950, one comes across pictures of a quality that makes one want to know more about the artists, especially the naive painters, with their primitive virtues of honesty, decorative instinct, and purity of style. In military painting since Trumbull, it would be hard to name more than a half-dozen well-known American artists who practiced it more than a few times. The United States in the nineteenth century, with an ocean on either side and no powerful land neighbors, was a pacific nation compared to most European countries. It had no large peacetime military establishment, no strong military caste, and no such cult of war as Napoleonic France and Prussian Germany. There was little to encourage a school of military art. And war itself had changed; with the development of high explosives and the growing mass-character of warfare, it was no longer the personal hand-to-hand combat that Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Rubens had transformed into great plastic art, and that West and Trumbull had found so full of drama. Since West's school such military art as America produced was singularly free from the glorification of martial virtues that one finds in David, Gros, Meissonier, and Detaille. The finest artistic record of the Civil War, that of Winslow Homer, illustrates this change in viewpoint. Hardly a single painting or illus- tration by Homer has any element of the heroic. Only three or four times did he attempt battle scenes. Mostly he pictured everyday life in camp-chores and recreations, human and humorous aspects. His work was military genre rather than conventional military art. No other artist left so authentic a record of how the Civil War soldier really looked and acted. Its nearest literary equivalent did not appear for thirty years-Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage. On the other hand, Homer's art did not touch the emotional depths of Walt Whit- man's Civil War poetry and prose-but for that there was no equivalent in our pictorial art. Naval warfare produced more and better art than land warfare; and this was true of maritime affairs in general, as was natural in a nation which up to the Civil War had one of the world's most flourishing merchant marines. On the eastern seaboard grew up a lively school of marine painters, who devoted themselves to glorifying the spectacular achievements of American clippership designers, builders, and captains. 287</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN QUARTERLY These great sailing ships were magnificent subjects for art, and our best marine specialists, such as Thomas Birch, Robert Salmon, James Buttersworth, and FitzHugh Lane, were distinguished artists in their field. The world-wide, romantic whaling industry, in which America led the world, produced many fine salty records, often amateur work by men who had gone on the long whaling voyages. That huge historic phenomenon, the westward expansion, brought forth some of our most original art. The early nineteenth-century exploring expeditions were almost always accompanied by artists, often as official topographical draftsmen. As the continent was opened up, many painters visited the West, and some lived there for years. The tremendous scale of the country, the wide horizons and serene monotony of the Great Plains, the majesty of the Rocky Mountains, the hordes of wild animals still roaming the wilderness, the mysterious alien life of the Indians-all this was virgin material, without precedent in Europe or the East, and calling for a new artistic vision. Some of the painters did little more than translate it into conventional romantic terms; but occasionally an artist like Catlin, awakened to this world so much vaster and more primeval than the tidy, cultivated European landscape, created a style expressive of the majesty of the West. Painters like Eastman, Miller, Deas, and Wimar, or more famous names such as Bierstadt, Moran, and Remington in their less conventional, more genuine moments, produced pictorial records of the old West which will always have both historical and artistic value. But more than the painters, it was the illustrators and printmakers who were the visual recorders of American history. Today, when the camera-man is ubiquitous, we are apt to forget that up to the invention of photography, the artist was the sole maker of pictures-not only paintings, but every illustration in a book or periodical, and every print for framing. Indeed, until the general adoption of photome- chanical reproductive processes in the 1880's, most published pictures were still drawn by hand. Even today the camera has not entirely supplanted the artist in the making of visual records; the human eye and hand can often produce more legible pictures than the camera, as is proved by the continuing use of artists by the popular press. So it is to prints and illustrations that we must turn for the fullest visual record of nineteenth-century America. Publishers like Currier &amp; Ives, and illustrated news magazines like Harper's Weekly, and the hosts of artists who worked for them, were producing not for the cultivated rich who bought paintings, but for the general public. They had no inhibitions about picturing aspects of American life that seemed too common for most painters, but which to us are the very things we 288</page><page sequence="7">THE PAINTING OF AMERICAN HISTORY want to know about our past. For example, the building of railroads, one of the most extraordinary material achievements of any nation or age, was scarcely touched by painters but was fully recorded in illustrations and prints. The Civil War produced surprisingly little painting at the time, but was covered by artist-correspondents more fully than any war up to that time. Artists of the first rank, such as Darley, Homer, and Nast, were popular illustrators; and painters like Mount, Bingham, and Tait reached a wide public through colored lithographs of their paintings. Here was an art for the people if there ever was one. Genre painting, or the picturing of daily life, began to flourish about the second quarter of the century, as did landscape. The preponderance of portraiture, and the prevailing neoclassic esthetic of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, had been unfavorable to its earlier growth. Everyday life was considered less worthy of artistic treatment than nobler themes. Even in Europe, Millet's and Courbet's subjects were regarded as revolutionary. Our most sophisticated artists had their eyes fixed on Europe more than on America, as was natural. Art grows out of art as much as out of reality; and European traditions offered little precedent for picturing the new crude American scene. But with the rise of Jacksonian democracy in the late 1820's, and the decline of the old colonial aristocracy, came a new sense of the importance of the common man, and a growing nationalist sentiment. Colonial deference to Europe gave way to provincial belief in America as the greatest country in the world. Artists and their new-rich patrons began to turn to native, contemporary subjects-the everyday life of America, the rising tide of commerce and prosperity, American cities and the spectacular natural features of the continent, social occasions and public spectacles, sports and country life, and the humorous or sentimental aspects of daily existence. Such subjects did not seem vulgar to the new generation as they would have to the colonial and early republican aristocracy. As early as the 1790's Francis Guy was painting his delightful views of country estates around Baltimore, featuring the owner and his family promenading; and a few years later, his northern city scenes with crowds of townspeople, suggesting Bruegel. About 1810 John Lewis Krimmel began picturing the life of Philadelphia in small, ex- quisitely painted watercolors and oils. It is recorded that he received few commissions, as "works of the species he delighted in were not sought after by the wealthy patrons of art." Occasionally portraitists would break away from their regular occupation to paint genre pic- 289</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN QUARTERLY tures, such as the two lovely conversation pieces, "The Tea Party" and "The Dinner Party," by Henry Sargent of Boston, painted about 1825. But the first American-born painter to devote himself chiefly to genre was William Sidney Mount. Living most of his years on a Long Island farm, he began about 1830 to paint the people and events of his community. Few artists have built their art so completely out of the life around them. His scenes of farm life were pervaded by good cheer, a kindly sense of humor, and an engaging sentiment; and handled with a skill, a fresh eye, and a sense of character that still make him one of our most gifted painters. His art was the purest pictorial ex- pression of the agrarian democracy of Jacksonian America. His example encouraged many artists to attempt similar themes, so that Mount can be called the founder of our native genre school. Out in Missouri in the 1840's another local product, George Caleb Bingham, began painting the lusty life of Mississippi flatboatmen and the excitements of local politics, with a combination of realism, satire, and a classic sense of design astonishing in the product of such an environment. By the mid-century a flourishing native genre school had grown up. In their backgrounds the painters ranged from David G. Blythe, eccentric self-taught satirist of the growing town of Pittsburgh, to Richard Caton Woodville, son of an old Maryland family, painting eastern rural and city types in a precise technique learned in Dusseldorf, but with a humor and sense of character typically American, and to Eastman Johnson, who spent years in Holland copying Rembrandt before returning to America to paint his solid, richly human scenes of Yankee farm life. As was natural in a nation still largely agricultural, country life was the favorite theme-all the idyllic aspects of the old-fashioned American farm: country dances, corn-husking bees, cider making, goose raffles, turkey shoots, the hardships and comforts of wintertime. The farm was still the background of a large part of the American population. Most of the painters had been country boys, as had many of their patrons, and their pictures offered an escape from the com- plexity and ugliness of city life into what seemed a simpler, purer world. This nostalgia for the farm was an important element in the nineteenth-century American mind, finding frequent expression in our art and literature. A similar nostalgia appeared in the many child- hood scenes, a recurring motif in both art and letters, and one that has produced its masterpieces, such as Huckleberry Finn and Little Women. Our artists and writers of the Gilded Age were apt to understand childhood better than the bewildering new America of factories and immigrants and millionaires. This sentiment for childhood appeared 290</page><page sequence="9">THE PAINTING OF AMERICAN HISTORY at its purest and freshest in the early work of Winslow Homer, the most delightful record of a country boyhood in all our art. Everyday work was not often pictured. Bingham's boatmen were rollicking, Mount's farmers were fiddling or dancing, or taking their "nooning," Johnson's country people were engaged in corn-husking bees or maple-sugar festivals, when work took on a communal and festal character. There was little of Millet's or Courbet's intensely serious picturing of hard daily labor, the central fact in the farmer's existence. Nor was there any sign of the elements of decay in agri- cultural life-the mortgage, the abandoned farm, the forlorn old age, as later in the stories of Mary Wilkins Freeman. These artists were painting eastern farm life in its golden day, and showing its cheer, sturdy independence, and simple enjoyments. Their work was pervaded by an optimism and good humor that we like to think of as typically American. Sex played little part in this art, except in the highly sublimated form of Victorian sentiment. A devotion to home and family and the domestic virtues was always displayed. Occasionally we are given a glimpse of the alcoholic capacity of the American male, as in Bingham's pictures of election-day carousing, but this was exceptional; the public lip service to temperance was usually respected. There was much humor, of a good-natured, innocent kind, without lewdness or brutality. Compared to French, German, or even English genre, there was little satire; Bingham's frank picturing of local politics, and Blythe's and David Claypoole Johnstone's Hogarthian caricatures of low life, were exceptional. The city found little place in American genre painting, although it played a leading part in our prints. In these days when the eastern cities were growing so tremendously, there was no American Daumier to record their teeming life. Our cities were not decorative; aside from a few presentable parks, public buildings, and older sections, showing some traces of planning and elegance, they were chaotic, squalid, and monotonous. There was little in America to compare to the ordered beauty of Rome or Paris. To reveal our cities in all their ugliness and disorderly energy would have required a more drastic realism than most of our painters possessed. And of course slums and saloons and painted women would have horrified the art public of the time. The burgher preferred his rural reminiscences, or at the most, J. G. Brown's scrubbed newsboys or E. L. Henry's charming little idyls of early New York. Of the vast industrialization that was transforming America there was hardly a reflection in the painting of the time. John F. Weir's 291</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN QUARTERLY "Forging the Shaft" and "The Gun Foundry," painted in the 1860's, were isolated phenomena. The epic of railroad building was celebrated by printmakers and illustrators but by few painters. The industrial laborer himself was seldom pictured: Thomas Anshutz's "Steel Workers: Noontime," painted about 1890, and J. G. Brown's "Longshoremen's Noon" were among the earliest essays of their kind. Except for the cartoonists, there was no satire on the current social order. As one critic said, Eastman Johnson's pictures of workers "preached no ugly doctrine of discontent." The limitations of our nineteenth-century genre school are obvious enough. The temper of the times did not encourage a frank or critical picturing of American civilization. The wonder is that in such an environment our artists did manage to produce so much that was honest, fresh, and real. They bequeathed to us not only an authentic record of certain aspects of American life, but some of the best painting ever produced in this country. How important was their contribution, neglected until recently, is demonstrated by the recently opened Maxim Karolik collection in the Boston Museum. The school reached its culmination in the early works of Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins, the chief representatives in this country of the world-wide trend towards naturalism. Compared to their pred- ecessors, they were more mature artists, wider in range, deeper in emotional content, more realistic in their viewpoint on the American scene. Homer in his varied and delightful early work pictured country life in both farm and summer resort, and the world of childhood, with a freshness, originality, and force that were new notes in our art. As he matured he turned to more primitive and elemental aspects of the contemporary world-to the lives of woodsmen, hunters, fishermen, and sailors-and became our greatest chronicler of outdoor life. Eakins, on the other hand, took the ordinary middle-class city life of America in the last third of the nineteenth century, and with un- compromising realism built his art out of this intractable material. His early scenes of home life and the outdoor sports of the city dweller revealed a mastery of the human body, a penetrating sense of char- acter, a deep human warmth, and a grave poetry. In his two great paintings of surgical clinics, "The Gross Clinic" and "The Agnew Clinic," he attacked a theme that few artists had dared to, but a theme of central importance in modern times-the drama of science and its battle against disease and death. He was our first great artist to accept completely the realities of American life and to create out of them a profound and powerful art. Homer and Eakins, though bringing to maturity the depiction of 292</page><page sequence="11">THE PAINTING OF AMERICAN HISTORY American life, were in a sense anachronisms in relation to world art. The prevailing trends, impressionism and post-impressionism, were contrary to their kind of naturalism. They had no immediate successors. With the tremendous increase in wealth and cosmopolitanism after the Civil War, the old native school was outmoded. Paris became the center of the art world, and when the younger men returned, America seemed crude and ugly compared to Europe. They had lost their predecessors' naive acceptance of their native land, and few of them were like Homer and Eakins, strong enough to see the same beauty of reality here as elsewhere. Whistler taught them that the storytelling picture was pass6. Impressionism went a step further with its doctrine that things in themselves were less important than the light that fell on them and the air that bathed them-a conception fatal to genre art. Most of the new generation of American painters ignored the Amer- ican scene, or on the rare occasions when they essayed it, they shunned anything common or ugly, or that might seem to tell a story, and selected their themes from the politer levels of society, to which they belonged or aspired. So we were given witty and charming glimpses of social life, by William M. Chase or Julius L. Stewart; the sheltered New England homes of the Boston school; idyls of youth and sunlight and pretty faces, the vacation side of life; or the etherealized women of Dewing, Thayer, and Alexander. These were the days of the cult of the Languid Lady, pictured in boudoir, drawing room or garden, always decorative, and always engaged in what Veblen called "con- spicuous leisure." In its finest manifestations, such as the work of Dewing, this art attained a subtle, poignant poetry of femininity and domesticity; but in most cases its content was a tasteful vacuum. In the work of this Genteel Generation one found no hint of the broader realities of American life: our gigantic industry and commerce, our scientific and technological achievements, the great flood of immigra- tion, the growing social and economic conflicts, or, of course, the seamy side of life. Even Homer and Eakins shared to some extent in the prevailing trend. Homer retired to his solitary spot on the Maine coast, there to paint his epics of the sea and the forest, in which humanity appeared less and less. Eakins abandoned his outdoor and genre subjects, and concentrated on portraiture, attaining a new mastery in this more limited field, where the individual human being was all important and the social scene as a whole was shut out. The evolution of American historic and social art in the present century lies outside the scope of this eassy. But this much should be said: the paralyzing spell of gentility in the 1890's did not remain 293</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN QUARTERLY long unbroken. With the opening of the new century appeared a group of rebel realists-Henri, Luks, Sloan, Glackens, Shinn-who like their literary counterparts Crane, Norris, and Dreiser (they were all born within a few years of 1870) introduced a new and more thoroughgoing kind of naturalism. These painters brought our art back to the realities of American life, and especially of the modern American city. Since their pioneering days the picturing of the American scene has become immensely broad and diversified, and a major element in our art. From our position in mid-century we can now see that America has never before been interpreted so extensively and variously, so frankly and penetratingly, with such criticism and understanding, as by our artists of the past fifty years. 294</page></plain_text>
