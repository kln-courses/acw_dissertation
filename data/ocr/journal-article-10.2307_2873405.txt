<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHOSE GOD'S ON FIRST? SPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN THE PLAYS OF CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE BY DENA GOLDBERG In act 4, scene 4 of Tamburlaine part 1, the hero is baiting the caged Turkish emperor with more than ordinary gusto, thus prompting Ther- idamas to wonder aloud whether "Mahomet will suffer this." Techelles responds: "'Tis like he will, when he cannot let [that is, prevent] it.' "'1 This might be interpreted as a trendy jibe at the Moslem religion or, more likely, as an instance of Marlowe's antipathy to religion in general. Or it might be relegated to the status of a joke by a com- pulsively provocative young playwright. I begin with it here because like many of Marlowe's one-liners, Techelles's response states very simply a major concern of the playwright. What is at issue is not religion in particular or in general, but rather a particular religious orientation: an emphasis on the concept of special providence -of a god or gods who watch over every aspect of human life and lend a hand when their faithful followers are threatened. While Marlowe's Christian contem- poraries were certainly not all of one mind as to the extent or the legibility of divine intervention in human affairs, it remained safer to see providence in the fall of a sparrow than to attribute that fall to a broken branch. So if Marlowe expresses his satire of providentialist thought in the form of a quick joke by a Moslem warrior, that is one of the devices he uses to evade the censor and to catch the audience off guard. If Marlowe succeeded in impressing the censor as frivolous enough to be "allowed," let us not be similarly misled. We cannot know that the playwright consciously deployed humor in this way, but we do know that some of his contemporaries did. Fulke Greville explained that fear of the authorities caused him to "take away all opinion of seriousness" from his more dangerous political speculations "and to this end carelessly cast them into that hypocriticall figure Ironia, wherein men commonly (to keep above their workes) seeme to make toies of the utmost they can doe. "2 To what extent Marlowe, like Greville, plotted consciously to escape censorship and other forms of oppression will remain uncertain. But given the rhetorical emphasis of his education, there is no reason to believe that Marlowe was less canny than Greville or the others who "commonly" worked this way. ELH 60 (1993) 569-587 C 1993 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 569</page><page sequence="2">In this paper, I will examine Marlowe's use-with whatever degree of consciousness -of "toies" and other devices to undermine the con- cept of special providence. I hope to show that the subject of provi- dentialism is central to several of Marlowe's plays, and that these works may be seen to support Annabel Patterson's contention that "'litera- ture' in the early modern period was conceived in part as the way around censorship. "3 I will also suggest a possible political ramification of the writer's concern with this aspect of theology. Before we turn to Marlowe, let us consider the doctrine of special providence as Marlowe and his audience would have encountered it. For this I have chosen texts with obvious popular appeal, since my concern is to get as close as possible to what was in the air, and thus on the minds of the people Marlowe wrote for. In particular, I will focus on the literature of exploration and exploitation as participating in a discourse that also figures largely in the Marlowe plays. I: MY GOD CAN BEAT YOUR GOD In the 1560s, according to the account in Hakluyt's Principall Nav- igations, Voiages and Discoveries Of The English Nation, a merchant ship bound for Seville was overtaken by eight Turkish galleys. Though the Christians fought bravely, they were overwhelmed by numbers and taken to Alexandria, where they were kept in irons during the winter months and used as galley slaves the rest of the year. Imprisoned with the English were Christians from sixteen different nations. Even- tually, several prisoners, including an Englishman named John Fox, were permitted considerable freedom of movement, though always encumbered with leg irons. Finally, in 1577, Fox and the other mobile prisoners engineered a spectacular escape, "delivering 266 Christians out of the captivitie of the Turkes. Although almost all of the original Englishmen have died, this does not prevent the unidentified narrator from telling the story as an exemplum of the power of faith and of God's concern for the faithful. Before the Christians can get their stolen ship under sail, there is so much artillery ranged against them that "there is no man, but would thinke it must needes be sunke." Yet their faith is so great that there "was not one of them that feared the shotte, which went thundring round about their eares." Their escape is attributed to God, who did "hold foorth his buckler" to shield them (PN, 153). It is not at all clear why God did not intervene in the first place to spare his faithful the horrors of over a decade of galley servitude. The account is typical of its genre in its selective invocation of 570 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="3">providence, although, as we shall see, some texts offer explanations of suffering. The narrative is also typical in the way it deals with other religions. We are told that while the Christians were making their getaway, the Turkish enemy fell into confusion, a state of affairs that is connected with the erroneousness of their religious beliefs: There was no man that would take charge of a gaily, the weather was so rough, and there was such an amasedness amongst them. And verely I thinke their God was amased thereat: it could not be but he must blush for shame, he can speake never a word for dulnes, much lesse can he helpe them in such an extremitie. Well, how- soever their God behaved himselfe, our God shewed himselfe a God in deede, and that he was the onely living God. (PN, 154) The victory is attributable to the correct choice of deity, rather than to any special virtue or grace in the victors. Although the incipient polytheism here is largely canceled out by the irony, in some texts the foreign gods acquire a shadowy reality as lesser powers. Not only the choice of religion, but also the form of worship is crucial, as we learn from an account of a sea battle between five English merchant ships on one side and eleven galleys and two frigates of Spain on the other. As the battle begins, the English pray to God for the victory. "Contrarily, the foolish Spanyards they cryed out according to their maner, not to God, but to our Lady (as they terme the virgin Mary)," (PN, 230) and so lost the battle in spite of their military advantage. In other texts the workings of providence are seen to be related to moral qualities of the human protagonists. This is the case in "A report of the voyage and successe thereof, attempted in the yeere of our Lord, 1583, by Sir Humfrey Gilbert knight ... written by M. Edward Haies Gentleman, and principal actor in the same voyage, who alone con- tinued unto the end, and by Gods speciall assistance returned home with his retinue safe and entire" (PN, 679). Being singled out in this way apparently left Haies feeling a special responsibility toward the dead, the living, and God. He opens his account with a long intro- duction on the theological aspects of the colonizing project, affirming that success will only come to those whose first aim is conversion of the heathen. The end of the world is imminent, he believes, so there is little time left to accomplish this holy task. The disastrous outcome of the voyage for most of the venturers must not be taken as a sign that God opposes exploration and settlement of the new world (this is Haies's main point and the reason for writing the account). It does show, however, that "it behoveth every man of great calling, in whom Dena Goldberg 571</page><page sequence="4">is any instinct of inclination unto this attempt, to examine his owne motions: which if the same proceed of ambition or avarice, he may assure himselfe it commeth not of God, and therefore can not have confidence of Gods protection . . ." (PN, 680). If, on the other hand, his motives are virtuous, "preferring chiefly the honor of God" and "compassion of poore Infidels captived by the devill," then he "may hope, or rather confidently repose in the preordinance of God" (PN, 680). Apparently, God does not place a high premium on charity, for Haies's account is full of smug backbiting of the many who did not survive the expedition; and he ends by gloating so unabashedly over their misfortune that it is hard to imagine any sort of deity who might be thought to approve of this. In spite of suffering and loss endured, Haies declares himself comforted in the goodness of God, and his undoubted providence following him in all that voyage, as it doth alwaies those at other times, whosoever have confidence in him alone. Yet have we more neere feeling and perseverance of his powerful hand and protection, when God doth bring us together with others into the same peril, in which he leaveth them, and delivereth us, making us the be- holders, but not the partakers of their ruine. (PN, 696; emphasis added) Haies's understanding of the relations between special providence, piety of motive, and material gain is shared by many venturers, in- cluding Richard Hakluyt himself. In the epistle to Sidney that prefaces his earliest anthology, Hakluyt enunciates very clearly the philosophy that informs his work as a promoter of exploration. He says that although it is true that God can work through evil agents, as He has done through the Spanish and the Portuguese-who only pretend to be converting the heathen-only purity of motive can really ensure suc- cess. Thus the English can be certain to prosper in the future if they overcome the "preposterous desire of seeking rather gaine then Gods lorne": But wee forgotte, that Godlinesse is great riches, and that if we first seeke the kingdome of God, al other thinges will be given unto us, and that as the light accompanieth the Sunne, and the heate the fire, so lasting riches do waite upon them that are zealous for the advauncement of his glorious Gospell.... I truste that nowe being taught by their manifolde losses our men will take a more godly course, and use some part of their goods to his glorie.5 In spite of the ambiguity of al other thinges and lasting riches, the message is clear enough. God rewards piety with material success, especially if, like the queen, he is offered a share of the loot. 572 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="5">Still, there is an unresolved tension in Hakluyt's statement, one that is latent in any doctrine of special providence. For there is no denying that the Conquistadores, despite their moral depredations and the idolatry of their religion (as seen through Protestant English eyes), are bringing home argosies fraught with gold and other goodies. Hakluyt's explanation, that God can turn even "covetousnes to serve him," creates a disjunction within his theology. On the one hand, providence is rational, rewarding virtue; on the other, it is unfath- omable and not to be questioned. I am deliberately avoiding reference to theology in its purer forms, because what concerns me here is not theory but ideology, the assumptions that actually underpin the actions of ordinary people. Like other plain men, Hakluyt is constructing his ideology out of bits and pieces of what he finds around him. Whatever his weaknesses as a philosopher, he does no worse than anyone else in attempting to explain why evil is so often rewarded. One more general point before we turn to Marlowe. In reading the voyage literature, one encounters instances in which the doctrine of special providence is used as a weapon in the effort to dominate in- digenous people. In these cases, the venturers, finding the native people apt to be impressed by their military power, encourage the natives to see them as the chosen people of the most powerful of the gods (if not as gods themselves). Rarely do these explorers admit to simple cynical manipulation of religious impulses. Usually the natives themselves are portrayed as hopelessly superstitious. According to the account by Ralph Lane, it is one of the native Virginian rulers who, because he is favorably disposed to the white men, plays upon the credulity of his people: "Hee had often before tolde them. . . . that wee were the servants of God, and that wee were not subject to be destroyed by them. . . . and that we being dead men were able to doe them more hurt, then now we coulde do being alive" (PN, 743). Although Lane denies responsibility for these unorthodox teachings, he obviously relies on them to keep the natives in line. This becomes clear at the point in the narrative where the settlers send an exploratory party into the territory of another native tribe, the Renapoaks. As soon as a rumor reaches the settlement that the party of venturers has been defeated in battle by the Renapoaks, there is a change in attitude toward the settlers. For the rumor tooke such effect in [the king's] breast, and in those against us, that they grew not onely into contempt of us, but also (contrary to their former reverend opinion in shew, of the almightie God of heaven, and Jesus Christ, whome wee serve and worship, whome before Dena Goldberg 573</page><page sequence="6">they woulde acknowledge and confesse the onely God:) nowe they began to blaspheme, and flatly to say, that our Lord God was not God, since hee suffered us to sustaine much hunger, and also to be killed of the Renapoaks. (PN, 743) As Peter Hulme has so convincingly argued, it would be a great mistake to attribute any accuracy to accounts of indigenous people written by men who had little interest in learning their language, let alone understanding their ideology.6 It is probable that the mentality that Lane depicts-the brutal, simplistic, opportunistic providential- ism -has more to do with Lane himself than with the native Virginians. Lane's tendency to confound providence with chance becomes trans- parent when, in narrating the rest of this episode, he says, "but that which made up the matter on our side for the time, was an accident, yea rather, (as all the rest was) the good providence of the Almightie for the saving of us" (PN, 743). It must have been the same Almightie- "who never suffereth his elect to perish" -that saved the transatlantic crook and slave-trader John Hawkins by sending a good wind at a crucial moment (PN, 523).7 II: SLEEPY MAHOMET In the first Tamburlaine play, Marlowe subjects the doctrine of special providence to ridicule by repeatedly arousing and then thwart- ing the expectation of divine intervention. Aside from Techelles and Usumcasane, Tamburlaine's original cohorts, there is scarcely a char- acter in the play who doesn't believe that some deity or other is bound to intervene in behalf of Tamburlaine's victims and the hallowed status quo. An audience steeped in traditional ideology likewise anticipates the downfall of a tyrant who not only rejects all worldly authority, but also has Mahomet, Jupiter, and some unnamed Persian gods gunning for him. That the Christian god does not figure in the play is hardly relevant, except from the censor's point of view. The use of Jupiter as a pseudonym for God goes back at least as far as Everyman; and there is nothing to distinguish these exotic deities from the Christian god, whether they are being called upon to defend the innocent or to punish Tamburlaine's "presumption. " In fact, the gods in the play, like the God of the explorers, are expected to take a non-stop interest in the power struggles of human beings. What is demonstrated both here and in Tamburlaine part 2 is that the belief in special providence -in a personalized god, Christian or otherwise, who looks after individuals or groups -is absurd. History, as retold by Marlowe, proves that the gods don't work that way. And 574 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="7">history, of course, would be part of Marlowe's defense of his play.8 This is not necessarily the statement of an atheist, although any ques- tioning of providence might have earned Marlowe the epithet in his time. It is true that the failure of their Moslem god to save them causes Bajazeth and Zabina to convert from their original faith to something very like atheism: Bajazeth. Ah, villains, dare ye touch my sacred arms? 0 Mahomet: 0 sleepy Mahomet: Zabina. 0 Cursed Mahomet, that mak'st us thus The slaves to Scythians rude and barbarous: (T, 3.3.268-71) and finally: Zabina. Then is there left no Mahomet, no god. (T, 5.1.238) But Zabina is not Marlowe, although she may well stand for members of Marlowe's audience. Rather, Marlowe seems to be satirizing, in Zabina and her husband, the kind of belief in god that cannot survive personal misfortune. The notion of Mahomet the intercessor as sleepy is amusing in itself, and the progression from sleepy to cursed to non- existent calls attention to the flimsiness of a faith based on anthro- pomorphism and expectation of personalized divine assistance. How confused providentialism can be is epitomized when Zenocrate, who is of course rooting for Tamburlaine, nevertheless chastises "heaven" for falling down on the job of protecting emperors: Blush, heaven, that gave them honor at their birth And let the die a death so barbarous. (T, 5.1.351) If Zenocrate's blushing heaven reminds us of the blushing god of the John Fox narrative, the echo does not signify that Marlowe had read that particular text, but rather that the language and the motifs of providentialist excess were current and are parodied in Marlowe's play. At least twice, Marlowe parodies the my-god-can-beat-yours mo- tif. As Bajazeth and Tamburlaine prepare for battle, they make their preliminary vaunts, calling upon the powers they expect to aid them. Bajazeth begins: Dena Goldberg 575</page><page sequence="8">By Mahomet my kinsman's sepulcher And by the holy Alcoran I swear He shall be made a chaste and lustless eunuch And in my sarell tend my concubines. (T, 3.3.75-78) Tamburlaine's turn is next: By this my sword that conquer'd Persia, Thy fall shall make me famous through the world. (T, 3.3.82-83) The ritual, with its parallelism, emphasizes the contrast between the emperor who swears by his prophet and his holy book, and the con- queror who swears by nothing, affirming that his sword (a metonymy for himself) will gain the victory. This level of meaning could not but be clear to Marlowe's audience. More subtle is Marlowe's parody of the invocation of gods for purposes of brutal oppression. The juxta- position of the word holy with the threat of castration must have suggested to at least some auditors that heaven is sometimes (and not only by Turks) invoked for hellish purposes. In the second instance, Bajazeth calls upon his god again, this time to punish the man who has defeated him: Ye holy priests of heavenly Mahomet, That, sacrificing, slice and cut your flesh, Staining his alters with your purple blood, Make heaven to frown and every fixed star To such up poison from the moorish fens And pour it in this glorious tyrant's throat: (T, 4.2.2-7) To which Tamburlaine replies: The chiefest God, first mover of that sphere Enchas'd with thousands ever-shining lamps, Will sooner burn the glorious frame of heaven Than it should so conspire my overthrow. (T, 4.2.8-11) This time Marlowe plays the game of competitive religions, but his purpose is genuinely comparative. His genius for poetic contrast creates the juxtaposed images of a religion of suffering and sacrifice on the one hand, and a religion of cosmic splendor on the other. Blood-stained altars, frowning heavens, poisonous nature -these concretize the re- ligion of Bajazeth, the loser, while Tamburlaine's faith is imaged in 576 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="9">fire, light, and jewels. And while Bajazeth abjectly petitions his deity with a bribe of flesh, through a hierarchy of priests and prophets, Tamburlaine refers confidently to the motions of the "chiefest God." Central to this complex set of contrasts is the opposition between a special providence called into operation by the sufferings and bribes of believers, and a more distant, unassailable power inherent in the universal law. This latter power, which is not necessarily incompatible with Christian providence in the larger sense, does not interfere with the universal laws it has set in motion. It will not "conspire" Tam- burlaine's overthrow, not only because Tamburlaine is in tune with this power, but also, and more fundamentally, because it is not given to so anthropomorphic and uncertain an activity as conspiring. As the scene continues, Bajazeth, who is being trodden upon by the conqueror ascending his throne, turns his face from god "to the fiends," while Tamburlaine addresses the heavens in a now famous speech: Smile, stars that reign'd at my nativity, And dim the brightness of their neighbor lamps; Disdain to borrow light of Cynthia, For I, the chiefest lamp of all the earth, First rising in the east with mild aspect, But fixed now in the meridian line, Will send up fire to your turning spheres And cause the sun to borrow light of you. (T, 4.2.33-40) Continuing the cosmic imagery, Marlowe here identifies human power with universal energy. Tamburlaine is mighty because he is infused with power by those "ever-shining lamps" moved by the "first mover" of the earlier speech. Now at his personal zenith, he has himself become a source of energy-a sun. How literally we are to take this is bound to remain uncertain, given the ambiguousness of poetic imagery. The stars may be seen as metaphoric for Necessity or Fate. Or they may be seen as symbolizing Necessity while literally embodying and trans- mitting the power of their creator, or first mover. The passage certainly seems to echo the ideas of the philosopher Pompanazzi, who believed that the stars and their power, rather than any special providence, controlled the universe. However we choose to read Tamburlaine's speeches in this scene, what is obvious is the aesthetic superiority of Tamburlaine's religion over Bajazeth's. That Tamburlaine's creed is also the one that works is borne out by the plot; and even the episode with the virgins of Damascus can be seen as part of a demonstration Dena Goldberg 577</page><page sequence="10">of the foolishness of struggling against Necessity, here embodied in the person of Tamburlaine. The ambiguity with respect to Tamburlaine's religion in this scene is matched by (what I see as a deliberate) ambiguity about the religion of the Turks. Marlowe's emphasis on the self-laceration of the priests and the need for intermediaries between the petitioner and god opens the way to an identification of the Moslem faith (as here depicted) with certain kinds of Christianity. The focus is on religious practice that emphasizes the role of a hierarchy of priests and saints, that encourages penance, and that expects god to respond favorably to offerings. By defining such practices as Turkish, Marlowe both enables the audience to view them critically and makes it possible for his play to be per- formed. III: OUR CARTHAGE GODS Indirect satire of Christian providentialism through the analogous satire of another religion figures largely in Dido Queen of Carthage.9 Like Tamburlaine, Aeneas has whatever-gods-may-be (or most of them) on his side. But whereas Tamburlaine's heavenly supporters remain discreetly in the background imagery of cosmic power, the gods who favor Aeneas step forth as characters. In a sense, Dido is the inverse of Tamburlaine part 1. The character Tamburlaine, the hero who embodies both will and destiny, is the antithesis of Aeneas, who appears to be a puppet manipulated by contending heavenly forces. And whereas the cosmic forces in Tamburlaine 1 are treated with grace and solemnity, the contention of the personified heavenly forces in Dido provoke irreverent laughter. To some extent, this difference between the plays has to do with differences in the theatrical context in which they were presented, as well as with an indecisiveness of character in Aeneas suggested by the fable.'0 It is also true that in putting the gods on stage in Dido, Marlowe is presenting the reductio ad absurdam of a heroic tale interpreted in terms of special providence. The image of the gods in the first scene plays havoc with all refer- ences to heaven thereafter. Jupiter and Hermes are presented like figures of lechery and sloth in a morality play, the patriarch "dandling Ganymede upon his knee" while his swift-footed messenger lies sleep- ing. The all-powerful Jupiter buys Ganymede's sexual favors with the jewels he once gave to Juno as a wedding present, and man and boy titter together over ways to discomfit that goddess. To this scene enters Venus, who proceeds to chastise Jupiter for neglecting his providen- tialist duties: 578 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="11">Ay, this is it! You can sit toying there And playing with that female wanton boy, Whiles my Aeneas wanders on the seas, And rests a prey to every billow's pride. (D, 1.1.50-53) She then gives a long and windy speech, suggesting that Aeneas is about to be overwhelmed by bad weather, which ends on a theological note: False Jupiter, reward'st thou virtue so? What, is not piety exempt from woe? Then die, Aeneas, in thine innocence, Since that religion hath no recompense. (D, 1.1.78-81) There is an extreme ironic disjunction between Venus's talk of virtue and innocence, and what her name implies, not to mention what we have just seen with our own eyes in the way of heavenly behavior. The irony is carried further when the goddess, having succeeded in nagging Jupiter into taking action, expresses her gratitude: "Great Jupiter, still honour'd may'st thou be / For this so friendly aid in time of need!" (D, 1.1.137-38). It is obviously absurd for Venus to speak the language of a mortal petitioner (especially after bullying Jupiter like an equal), but it is this very discrepancy that suggests the analogy between what is happening on stage and how some Christians use prayer. The expectation of "recompense" for piety, the insistence on god's personal attention to one's affairs, the gratitude for favors re- ceived -these are put into the mouth of Venus precisely because they are so out of place there. In this way Marlowe signals to the audience- firmly, but without danger of censorship-that the pagan framework of the play need not be taken too literally. Venus's belief that virtue should be rewarded is matched by larbus's insistence that vice be punished. When he becomes aware that Dido and Aeneas have been sheltering in a cave together, he expresses his amazement that Jupiter did not intervene to prevent or punish them: Can heaven endure this sight? Jarbus, curse that unrevenging Jove Whose flinty darts slept in Typhoeus' den Whiles these adulterers surfeited with sin. (D, 4.1.17-20) Dena Goldberg 579</page><page sequence="12">Since it is patently silly to expect the old lecher of the first scene to punish sin, least of all adultery, Jarbus's expectation of divine inter- vention is made ridiculous. Unlike Venus, Jarbus is pathetic, for he cannot talk Jupiter into doing his will and he seems oblivious of the real nature of the deity, which we, the audience, have been privileged to see. Having cursed Jove in act 4, scene 1, larbus then sacrifices and prays to him in act 4, scene 2. He has decided that it is Jove's "'empty alters" that have "enlarg'd our ills," although we in the audience are quite sure that Jove is too busy with Ganymede to worry about the problems of mortals. Jarbus addresses Jove as "Father of gladness and all frolic thoughts, / That with thy gloomy hand corrects the heaven," and begs him, if he be "a pitying God of power, / On whom ruth and compassion ever waits," to get rid of Aeneas (D, 4.1.3, 5-6, 19-20). This attribution of pity and compassion to Jupiter is another signal that Marlowe's meaning extends beyond his frame of reference. The Jupiter who is associated with "frolic thoughts" is the irresponsible deity of the first scene; the Jupiter who pities mortals is a stand-in for the Christian god. This ambiguity permits the figure of larbus to take on an ambiguous status as both pagan worshiper and, more generally, as believer in special providence. What the audience sees is a man indulging in self-centered wishful thinking about the nature of prov- idence. And by means of this image, the Christian (and largely Prot- estant) audience is reminded that God ("if any god," to quote Tam- burlaine in part 2) is unknowable and that He can no more be at the beck and call of every person with a prayer than can Mephistophilis be thought to run errands for all the Robins of the world, no matter how many magic spells they know. The keenest satire of providentialism in Dido takes shape through another ambiguity, that between Venus as deity and as Aeneas's mother. Recounting the fall of Troy at Dido's request, Aeneas reaches the point where he is surrounded by threatening Myrmidons: Dido. Ah, how could poor Aeneas scape their hands? Aeneas. My Mother Venus, jealous of my health, Convey'd me from their crooked nets and bands. (D, 2.1.220-22) In a way, Venus is a providentialist's dream come true, a deity who is also one's own mother. But the question arises whether so much pampering is entirely desirable (Aeneas's second line, with its rhyme and its sing-song regularity, sounds infantile). As the dramatic tension develops, we do not envy Aeneas the pressure he feels: 580 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="13">Carthage, my friendly host, adieu, Since destiny doth call me from the shore; Hermes this night descending in a dream Hath summon'd me to fruitful Italy; Jove wills it so, my mother wills it so; Let my Phoenissa grant, and then I go. (D, 4.3.1-6) There is a good deal of willing going on, none of it on the part of the hero. Marlowe seems to be saying that if you take the notion of special providence to its logical conclusion, there remains no place for human will, free or otherwise. It may be comforting to have a goddess for a mother, but it does little for one's heroic stature. It is also through the Aeneas-Venus relationship that Marlowe em- phasizes the absurdity of the my-god-can-beat-your-god aspect of prov- identialism. For if Aeneas has his own special deity on his side, that implies the existence of an opposition. The contention between Venus and Juno, in giving form and substance to the concept of dueling deities that informs so much of the voyage literature, reduces that concept to absurdity. The comedy of providentialism reaches a climax as a goddess (Juno) attempts to murder a sleeping child (Aeneas's son) in order to triumph over destiny. It is Juno herself who spells out the lesson. Significantly, she does not admit to defeat by a superior deity, but rather to the futility of resisting Necessity: "Bootless, I saw, it was to war with fate" (D, 3.2.49). Polytheism in Dido is the theatrical projection of the desire to have a god on one's side. Dido exhibits the human propensity to construct deities when she declares that because the tempests and the sands carried Aeneas to Carthage, they will henceforth "be our Carthage gods" (D, 4.4.96). But it is Dido the freethinker who sees beyond the religious framework when she remarks that the "water is an element, no nymph," (D, 4.4.147) and, finally, that "Aeneas [rather than the gods] calls Aeneas hence" (D, 5.1.132). In the end, the obviously fictitious gods cancel each other out and the framework deconstructs itself, leaving bare the story of a man trying to take control of his destiny. Marlowe was not alone in covertly attacking the belief in special providence under the guise of mocking somebody else's religion. Gior- dano Bruno thinly disguised Christian providence in the figure of a Jove who busied himself about the details of human life: "He has ordered that at noon today two melons in the plot of Franzino shall become ripe, but they are not to be gathered for three days, when Dena Goldberg 581</page><page sequence="14">they will be inedible."" Closer to home, Thomas Hariot, the math- ematician whose name was associated both with Marlowe's and with atheism, devoted an inordinate proportion of his A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia to an apparently straight- faced account of the natives' religion. Having mentioned their creation myth, in which a woman is impregnated by a god, he proceeds to other aspects, including their belief that after death the soul goes either to heaven, or els to a great pitte or hole, which they thinke to bee in the furthest partes of their part of the worlde towarde the sunne set, there to burne continually: the place they call Popogusso. 2 We might accept this as innocent information-giving, were it not for Hariot's reputation and for the statement that follows: What subtilty soever be in the Wiroances [chiefs] and Priestes, this opinion worketh so much in manie of the common and simple sort of people that it maketh them have great respect to their Governours. 3 Hariot seems to be making something familiar into something strange in order to empower his readers to view it objectively. Providentialism is treated with similar irony. Impressed by the imperialists' technology, the natives endow them with supernatural powers. On the occasion of drought, Hariot tells us, the white men are asked "to praie to our God of England, that he would preserve their corne, promising that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruite." This is not an isolated incident: There could at no time happen any strange sicknesse, losses, hurtes, or any other crosse unto them, but that they would impute to us the cause or meanes thereof for offending or not pleasing us.'4 Hariot's generalization applied equally well to a Church of England that had a special prayer for changing the weather. Hariot, Bruno and Marlowe are all doing the same thing-creating fictive personae to concretize the absurdities of providentialism. Bruno is most straightforward, and of course he suffered for his directness. Both Hariot and Marlowe protect themselves by giving their fictions an exotic setting. IV: THE CHIEFEST GOD Tamburlaine part 2 differs from both Dido and Tamburlaine part 1 in that it presents Christian characters and refers openly to Christian 582 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="15">theology. Coming to it directly from the first Tamburlaine play, one is struck by the hero's apparent conversion, as he swears not by his sword or by Jupiter, but by "sacred Mahomet" (T, 1.3.109). This sets up terms for the providentialist discourse in the play, which will cul- minate in Tamburlaine's burning of holy books in act 5. Before that happens, the text creates an association between Christ and Mahomet as parallel figures of intercession between men and a more remote and universal god. Tamburlaine 2 broaches a more serious and open-ended discourse of comparative religion than Dido, with its use of classical analogies for satirical purposes. It is a discourse that will be pursued in The Jew of Malta as well. In this paper, I can only touch on aspects of the play that relate to the issue of special providence. In particular, I want to point out Marlowe's use here of a double-bind structure to undermine providentialist ideology. The association between Christ and Mahomet is made in act 1, scene 1, as Orcanes, King of Natolia, swears a truce with the Christian Sigismund of Hungary: Orc. But, Sigismund, confirm it with an oath And swear in sight of heaven and by thy Christ. Sig. By Him that made the world and sav'd my soul, The Son of God and issue of a maid, Sweet Jesus Christ, I solemnly protest And vow to keep this peace inviolable. Orc. By sacred Mahomet, the friend of God, Whose holy Alcoran remains with us, Whose glorious body, when he left the world, Clos'd in a coffin mounted up the air And hung on stately Mecca's temple roof, I swear to keep this truce inviolable. (T, 1.1.137-42) Parallel structure emphasizes the echo between "Son of God" and "friend of God," an echo whose implications apparently go unperceived by the Christians in the play, since they later decide that it is not necessary to keep faith with the "infidels." Orcanes, shocked by the Christian failure to honor their vow by Christ as he honors his by Mahomet, calls upon Christ to prove his godhead and avenge the dishonor to his name by giving Orcanes the victory over the Christians in battle. Victorious, Orcanes reinforces the Christ/Mahomet parallel by attributing the victory-with apparent indifference -to either of them: "Now lie the Christians bathing in their bloods, / And Christ Dena Goldberg 583</page><page sequence="16">or Mahomet hath been my friend" (T, 2.3.10-11). As if this were not enough to unsettle a Christian audience, Marlowe then has the char- acter Gazellus, established in scene 1 as a wise and temperate man, contradict Orcanes's providentialism altogether: "'Tis but the fortune of the wars, my lord, / Whose power is often prov'd a miracle" (T, 2.3.31-32). Gazellus's speech not only makes an issue of providen- tialism, but on a subtler level it also strengthens the link between Christ and Mahomet as figures of mediation with equal claims on the faith of those who confound fortune with providence. All of this prepares the audience to fall into the trap Marlowe sets in act 5. Having defeated everybody in sight, Tamburlaine now decides that it is superstitious to worship Mahomet: Now, Casane, where's the Turkish Alcoran And all the heaps of superstitious books Found in the temples of that Mahomet Whom I have thought a god? They shall be burnt. In vain, I see, men worship Mahomet. My sword hath sent millions of Turks to hell, Slew all his priests, his kinsmen, and his friends, And yet I live untouch'd by Mahomet. (T, 5.1.171-74; 5.1.177-80) He protests his faith in the "God who sits in heaven, if any god, / For he is God alone" (T, 5.1.199-200), and he dares Mahomet to come down and show his power. It has been a matter of critical debate whether the onset of Tam- burlaine's mortal illness fifteen lines later should be attributed to Ma- homet or to natural causes. This way of formulating the issue must be precisely what Marlowe strove to achieve as he carefully built up the association of Christ and Mahomet. For it is due to this connection that the Christian auditor (or critic) wants to see the hand of Mahomet in Tamburlaine's illness. It feels like blasphemy to deny it. And yet what does it mean to a Christian to conclude that Tamburlaine's death is due to the providential intervention of Mahomet? Marlowe, who studied both logic and rhetoric, offers the audience a choice which constitutes a double bind. In accepting special provi- dence in the person of Mahomet, the auditor opens the way to religious relativism, or even polytheism; in rejecting Mahomet's (and by ex- tension Christ's) intercession, the auditor is pushed to accept it as fact that millions of people die, the innocent along with the guilty, without any visible intercession by Christ, Mahomet, or any other mediating 584 Providence in Marlowe</page><page sequence="17">figure. Either conclusion will serve Marlowe's purpose, which was, I am arguing, to undermine belief in the existence of a god who protects the interests of his chosen people. For all the theological pluralism of this play, there is no room in it for the figure I have called the god of the voyagers -the deity who stands firmly behind his Protestant Chris- tian Englishmen. And now it is time to adjust the image I have given of the voyage literature, for if ethnocentrism predominated, there were also writers who were genuinely interested in making connections with the exotic people they met. As a general rule, ethnocentrism is most characteristic of pirates and plunderers, whereas those adventurers who were pri- marily interested in establishing mercantile relations were more mo- tivated to gain some real understanding of the people they were dealing with. The connection between cultural openness and trade is stated explicitly in John Eldred's comment on Aleppo in 1583: This is the greatest place of traffike for a dry towne that is in all those parts: for hither resort Jewes, Tartarians, Persians, Armenians, Egyptians, Indians, and many sorts of Christians, and injoy free- dome of their consciences, and bring thither many kindes of rich merchandizes. (PN, 231) Mercantilism thus tended toward a more cosmopolitan outlook that favored a view of god as transcending regional differences, while prov- identialism clearly involved a resistance to interaction with foreigners. Many intellectuals of the time-among them Bruno, Dee, Charron, and Bodin -expressed religious attitudes supportive of international relations. Exploration and the expansion of trade made the issue press- ing. When Elizabeth entered into trade relations with Turkey in 1580, the question of how to deal with "infidels" became a matter of practical concern for Marlowe and his audience. Within this context, Tamburlaine part 2 can be seen as having a great deal to say to its original audience. A positive model of cultural openness is presented in Orcanes. While he may at first glance seem foolish in his readiness to turn to an alien god, Orcanes earns respect and closer consideration by being the most pious character in all of Marlowe. His acceptance of Christ is to be understood in terms of his major statement of faith in the play, his prayer to the god that sits on high and never sleeps, Nor in one place is circumscriptible, But everywhere fills every continent With strange infusion of his sacred vigour. (T, 2.2.49-52) Dena Goldberg 585</page><page sequence="18">The concept is geographical as well as metaphysical: the chiefest god is not to be circumscribed by man's puny intellect or by geographical boundaries. If this god chooses to manifest himself in Christ in one part of the world and Mahomet in another, there is nothing in this to threaten Orcanes, who deals with all people as subject to the same universal laws. Elizabeth rationalized trade with the Turks in terms of a similar universalization of her god. In the 1589 edition of Hakluyt's Voyages, the Elizabethan subject would have come upon a letter written by the queen to "the most Imperiall and most invincible prince, Zuldan Murad Chan . . . most sovereigne Monarch of the East Empyre." The letter thanks the emperor for mercantile rights, asks for more, and finally requests the release of Christian galley slaves. In return for these favors, the queen undertakes to be even more ardent in beseeching that God (who onely is above all things, and all men, and is a most severe revenger of all idolatrie, and is jelous of his honor vs. the false gods of the nations) to adorne your most invincible imperiall highnesse with all the blessings of those gifts, which onely and deservedly are accounted most worthie of asking. (PN, 166) The queen's letter, which occurs only ten pages after the John Fox narrative in which the Turkish god is insulted in providentialist terms, strives to place the new trade relations in an acceptable theological context. The emphasis on idolatry expresses Elizabeth's acknowl- edgement of a similarity between Protestant and Moslem worship (as opposed to the practices of her Catholic Spanish enemies). And her affirmation of the unitary, universal nature of God as against the "false gods of the nations" provides a framework for international relations. Marlowe's work in the theater was supportive of this aspect of the queen's policy.
