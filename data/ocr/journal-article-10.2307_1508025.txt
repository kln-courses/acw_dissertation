<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS HERBERT JENNINGS ROSE UNIVERSITY OF ST. ANDREWS, SCOTLAND IN a recent article,' F. Pfister has put forth a theory which appears to me so interesting a mixture of fruitful suggestion and of error as to repay a detailed and critical examination. It is briefly that 2 'der Verfasser des Urevangeliums, das in verschie- denen Fassungen den drei Synoptikern bekannt war, eine kynisch-stoische Heraklesbiographie vor Augen hatte, und in enger Abhaingigkeit von dieser das Leben Jesu gestaltete.' This proposition he endeavors to support by a series of comparisons between details of the life of Jesus as given in the Synoptic Gospels and descriptions of the corresponding events in the life of Herakles, especially as told by our later authorities, such as Diodorus Siculus and the so-called Apollodoros. I do not intend to go into the multiple questions of literary criticism which his position implies. The Urevangelium I think a most mistily hypothetical document, still more the 'different versions' which it is supposed by Pfister to have assumed in the short space of time between the Crucifixion and the writing of the canonical Gospels, say a couple of generations. The steps by which so Greek a performance as a life of Herakles could have got into the hands of the Evangelists, other than St. Luke, to say nothing of those of their presumed model and source, who would in all probability be a Palestinian Jew at that early date, are not so obvious as to be assumed without demon- stration. But these and many other objections in detail which might be made I waive, and am willing to consider the story told by the Synoptists as if it were one document, late enough to contain a proportion of non-historical matter, Greek or other, and therefore to have been influenced by literary and philo- sophic literature of the day. My point is rather that the parallels given by Pfister come nowhere near proving his case, and that some of them point in a different direction, not to a definite document or even an unwritten complex of tradition, but to ideas so prevalent at that time that it would have been a 1 A.R.W., xxxiv (1937), 42-60. 2 Ibid., p. 59.</page><page sequence="2">114 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW greater miracle than any the theologians postulate if they had not influenced the biographers of Jesus or any other re- markable figure in the religious life of the Empire or neighboring countries. By way of preface, I may be allowed to state my own view of the historical value of the Gospels. I think them a respectable collection of authorities, by no means to be followed as literally true in every detail, but containing a large core of fact and an accretion of fabulous material, such as one expects in the popu- lar telling of facts, which is on the whole astonishingly small.3 The facts which can be fairly deduced I suppose to be, briefly, as follows; philosophical and theological interpretation of them I deliberately leave on one side, as being quite irrelevant to our present purpose. Jesus was born, whether at Nazareth or Beth- lehem, at a date not very much earlier than the conventional beginning of the Christian era. His parents were Joseph, de- scribed repeatedly as a carpenter, and probably a master-work- man of respectable position in his own community, and his wife Miriam or Mary. Jesus was the eldest of a family of at least seven,4 the other members of which were not remarkable, though one of them, Jacob or James, acquired some reputation in the early Church.' The first three decades or so of Jesus' own life passed quietly,6 but when about thirty, apparently under the influence of John the Baptist, he embarked on the career of a wandering and unorthodox teacher. The impression produced on his hearers was so marked that the idea grew up, if not in his own mind certainly in those of his immediate follow- ers, that he was no other than the expected Messiah. This was 3 I have outlined my position in the Canadian Journal of Religious Thought (1928), 355-364. 4 His sisters are mentioned in the plural, and the names of his four brothers given, Mk. 6, 3; Mt. 13, 56. To make them other than his full brothers and sisters is the merest special pleading, arising out of the later dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary. 5 Besides the passages quoted in n. 4, see Gal. 1, 19. 6 At least, nothing except the pretty and nowise impossible tale of the childhood episode in the Temple (Lk. 2, 41 sqq.) has come down concerning this period. It is of course clear that the indication of his age in Lk. 3, 23, Wc&amp;eE Wr^iV rpLuKOVra, is not to be pressed too closely; by Jewish and Greek ideas alike it was the age of bodily and mental maturity. But a like vagueness concerning the dates of nearly everyone not prominent in public and official life is notoriously common in antiquity.</page><page sequence="3">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 115 converted without much difficulty by his enemies, the orthodox Jerusalem clergy, into a charge of sedition, and Pontius Pilate was persuaded to order his crucifixion at a date variously reckoned at from 29 to 33 A.D. For some reason no longer re- coverable, for it is hidden under the singularly beautiful legends of the Resurrection and Ascension, the belief gained ground that he was not really dead at all, and from this beginning came the remarkable spread and final triumph of Christianity. That such a figure should have become the focal point, not only for theological speculation but for poetical and mythical imagination, is not in the least surprising. In a short time there were current stories to the effect that he was of divine parent- age, not the son of Joseph but of the national god, a miracle- worker (it is possible, indeed likely, that he really possessed great powers of faith-healing, efficacious especially in nervous diseases and hysterical cases), and generally endowed with supernatural characteristics which became especially apparent after his supposed death. The day has surely passed when it was the fashion to rationalize these legends away in various shallow manners; it remains a fair question what source yielded these particular tales concerning him, and not some other, equally wonderful, series of fancies. Pfister's research is per- fectly legitimate in itself; my criticism is based solely on my belief that the source he suggests is the wrong one. He begins his parallels with the accounts of the birth re- spectively of Jesus and Herakles. Here of course there is a re- semblance, both being represented as having supernatural fathers; but here the resemblance ends, so far as points of com- parison having any significance go. Pfister puts as parallel the circumstances that in both cases the human parents are natives, or at least inhabitants, of the same place, Nazareth for the one pair, Mycenae for the other (as a matter of fact, Alkmene is regularly represented as being a native of Midea, while Mary is not associated with any other permanent residence than Naza- reth); but it is hard to see how any such story could avoid bringing the husband and wife, or future wife, somewhere to- gether. His next point rests on a curious misreading of the texts. 'Joseph,' he says, 'halt sich von Maria bis zur goittlichen</page><page sequence="4">116 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Empfaingnis fern: Amphitryon hailt sich von Alkmene bis zur gottlichen Empfalngnis fern,' and cites, for the one, Mt. 1, 25, for the other, Apollodoros ii, 55, 57, 61. But the actual texts tell a different story. Joseph is married to Mary, but being assured that she is supernaturally pregnant, leaves her untouched till after her delivery (c~ws o0 l-rEKEV UvbV); Amphitryon is not married to Alkmene, who had been left in his charge by her father, till after the expedition against the Taphioi, and on his return marries her and finds shortly after that Zeus has been beforehand with him. She bears twins, one to Zeus and the other to Amphitryon; Mary has one son. The real parallel to Joseph's conduct is not Amphitryon at all, but Oineus,7 who, perceiving that Dionysos is paying court to Althaia, 'uoluntate sua ex urbe excessit simulatque se sacra facere. at Liber cum Althaea concubuit, ex qua nata est Deianira.' Like Mary, Althaia has but one child, the offspring of her divine consort. Naturally, in the Jewish atmosphere of the Gospel narrative, there is no question of any anthropomorphic relationship like that of either Zeus or Dionysos in the Greek stories; but the miraculous impregnation takes place by immaterial means, EK T7rpEtCroS &amp;yov, Mt. 1, 18 and 20, cf. Lk. 1, 35, irvEdca 6ytLoo ErEXebor rat irL oe Kal bbaAts '7T41tirov =KLaJeL oot. The idea is by no means unparalleled. According to Plutarch,8 the Egyp- tians were of opinion that although no mortal man could be the lover of a goddess, it was possible for a god's irxdEca to 'draw near to a mortal woman and implant in her certain beginnings of birth,' which distinctly suggests the language of the Third Gospel. The whole matter is discussed at some length by Norden; 9 it is enough here to draw attention to the fact that only in this delicate and quasi-philosophical form could the story have gained currency at all in the circles in which it be- came in time an article of faith. But the main point is the difference from the legend of the birth of Herakles; Joseph and Oineus, being married, abstain from their wives because they will not interfere with a divine process of generation; Am- phitryon has no scruples of the sort, and indeed finds out only Hyginus, fab. 129. s Numa 4, cf. quaest. conuiu. 718 b. 9 Geburt des Kindes, 76 sqq.</page><page sequence="5">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 117 by accident that Zeus has been his rival; Mary and Althaia have in consequence each one child, while Alkmene bears twins. The general resemblance between one supernatural begetting and another is outweighed by the specific difference. Pfister's third point, that both married pairs change their residence before the birth of the divine child, again is very un- convincing owing to difference of detail. Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem for a specific purpose, some months after Mary has conceived, stay there till a little while after the birth of Jesus, and then proceed quietly to Jerusalem to perform the usual ceremonies of the eighth day, whence they return to Nazareth (Lk. 2, 21-39), or leave hurriedly to take refuge in Egypt from the persecution of Herod (Mt. 2, 13 sqq.). Amphitryon and Alkmene, before their marriage and before the visitation of Zeus, leave their native country because he is involved in a blood-feud,"' take refuge in Thebes and live there permanently. Incidentally, though of course a Stoic or Cynic biographer of the hero could not be expected to know this, the whole episode is secondary, a connecting link between the Tirynthian Herakles and the Theban Alkaios who, at some unknown time, was identified with him. In consequence, the fact, which forms Pfister's sixth point of comparison, that Herakles, though born in Thebes, is sometimes spoken of as Argive, while Jesus, though born in Bethlehem, is on occasion called a Nazarene, falls to the ground. Herakles is a conflation of two persons, and conse- quently bears titles appropriate to both; Jesus is spoken of as a Nazarene for the simple reason that he lived in Nazareth most of his life. Even more trivial is the seventh parallelism, that Jesus is called son of Joseph despite the story of his super- natural begetting, while Herakles is occasionally called son of Amphitryon, though his father is regularly said to have been Zeus. Heroes with a divine father, if their mothers had mortal husbands, regularly have just such a double patronymic; thus, the sons of Molione by Poseidon are on occasion called sons of Aktor, that being the name of their mother's husband." In the Gospels, Jesus is represented as being called Joseph's son by 10 Pseudo-Hesiod, Shield, 11, and many later passages. 11 As Iliad, xxiii, 638, cf. Apollod., ii, 139.</page><page sequence="6">118 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW those who have not heard of, or if they have do not believe in, his divine parentage, e.g., Mt. 13, 55. Passing now to the childhood and youth of both, Pfister makes much of the persecutions to which both are subjected, Jesus from Herod and Herakles from Hera. Again, the differ- ence of detail is great. The motives of the persecutors are very different, for Herod is afraid for his throne, Hera is simply jealous of her husband's illegitimate child, her usual attitude in such cases, paralleled for instance by her treatment of Apollo and Dionysos. Clearly, such a figure could not have been intro- duced into the story of Jesus, since that was created in an atmosphere of strict monotheism. But not only are the motives of the persecutors different; the intended victims react in a quite different way. In the case of Herakles, serpents are miraculously sent to kill him, and he strangles them; his brother Iphiklos is apparently not molested, but only frightened by the visitation. No part of the story represents Jesus himself as resisting Herod; his parents run away with him to Egypt. Again, in one obscure version of the story of Herakles 12 his mother is so afraid of Hera that she at once exposes him, and while exposed he is found by Athena and Hera herself. The former goddess persuades Hera to suckle the child and then returns him to Alkmene. Nothing in the very least like this occurs in the legends connected with the birth of Jesus; a some- what less distant parallel is furnished by the infancy of Diony- sos, who, like Jesus, is taken out of the way of Hera's jealousy by being entrusted to one nurse after another in various places, or by that of Zeus, who is hidden in a distant country (Crete) from the murderous designs of Kronos. Pfister is much happier when he looks in the legend of Hera- kles, as written by moralizing philosophers, for a parallel to the Temptation. We may at once discount the difference arising from the unlikeness of Greek mythology, and consequently Greek allegory, from that of post-Exilic Judaism; the former had no devil, the latter had. Hence Herakles is not assailed by any definitely wicked power, for his countrymen believed in none. Generally, as in Prodikos' version of the story, preserved 12 Diod. Sic., iv, 9, 6.</page><page sequence="7">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 119 for us especially by Xenophon,"3 Pleasure and Virtue personified meet him and each puts forward her claims in a set speech; Herakles chooses the latter. But there is another version, found in Dion of Prusa and supposed to go back to Antisthenes.14 In this, the hero is led up, like Jesus, to the top of a high mountain. But here the likeness ends, for he is not shown the kingdoms of the world from the mountain, but two allegorical groups of figures on it, one representing true kingship, the other tyranny, and asked which he prefers; he chooses the former. His conductor is Hermes, sent for the purpose by Zeus. The resemblance in detail is not very close, especially as Jesus is confronted with three temptations, Herakles with one choice. Again, Herakles is quite young, just past boyhood, Jesus a mature man, although just at the beginning of his active career. However, a certain resemblance does exist, and needs explana- tion. I would seek it in nothing more abstruse than the fact that anyone who sets out upon an important line of action may naturally be supposed to have thought it over beforehand and made some kind of choice. This being so, it is an episode likely to be found in the biography of every person, real or imaginary, who is represented as having undertaken some great task or embarked upon a career beneficial to others, troublesome or dangerous to himself, or both. To say nothing of the several scenes of consultation before a noteworthy exploit which deco- rate ancient histories, I would call attention to the fact that the episode of a deliberate choice, in which the chooser has the con- sequences of his election more or less clearly revealed to him by a supernatural being, either before or after he has chosen, is a feature of both Greek and Jewish tradition; classical examples are Paris (success in love or success of a higher kind, in war or kingship; the options are put before him by goddesses in both the earlier and later forms of the story),"5 Achilles (short and 13 Xenophon, Memor., ii, 1, 21 sqq. 14 Dion Prus., orat. i, 65 sqq. 15 The earlier form is in Iliad xxiv, 29-30, a passage absurdly misinterpreted or ex- punged by editors. Paris 'railed upon the goddesses when they came into his courtyard (bringing, obviously, unspecified gifts of some kind) and praised her (presumably a supernatural being, perhaps Aphrodite) who gave him grievous desire' (axXo'buvrYv, specifically lust felt by women; she gave him the power to arouse and control it as he</page><page sequence="8">120 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW glorious life, if he kills Hektor, or if he goes to Troy; long but in- glorious if he remains in Phthia),16 and Solomon (wisdom rather than long life, riches &amp;c.).17 Folktales of all lands of course make a feature of such episodes, told for their own sake rather than as a detail of a biography; hence the material lay ready to biographers' hands, to be inserted with more or less moralizing and more or less semblance of reality, according to taste.18 In the case of Jesus it is quite possible that the account we have goes back ultimately to his own telling of a subjective experi- ence. We cannot, therefore, deduce influence of one biography upon another because both contain an episode of temptation or, what comes to the same thing, choice between real and apparent goods, greater and lesser good, or the like, unless the resem- blance is very close indeed, closer than in the case under consid- eration, where, as already shown, the details differ not a little. As regards the activities of both in maturity, Pfister can bring forward only the vaguest and most general resemblance; both are represented as actively beneficent,'9 both suffer, both are submissive to the will of their divine fathers. The differences are much more striking. Jesus leads the life of a wandering teacher, and is credited moreover with a number of miracles, some of which are plainly folktales or stock wonderful episodes affixed to him as they might have been to anyone,20 while others have the air of real events given something of the miraculous by the admiring manner of their telling.21 He nowhere displays pleased, in other words to make any woman fall in love with him). The later, which Homer does not seem to have heard of, is of course the famous iudicium Paridis, in which he prefers Aphrodite to Hera and Athena, i.e., pleasure of love to kingship and prowess, - hardly wisdom at that early date. 16 Iliad ix, 410 sqq.; xviii, 95-96. 17 1 Kings, 3, 5-14. 18 See Stith Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature (FF Communications, Nos. 106-109, 116-117 = Indiana Univ.

Herakles is a huge eater and drinker, a great lover of women, a traveller all over the known and unknown world, his wanderings being limited only by the geographical knowledge of his biogra- phers, and either literally a killer of monsters, human and bestial, or else, in later and rationalizing accounts, such as we must postulate as influencing the Gospels if we postulate any, an enlightened conqueror and reformer, the type of the perfect king.23 At best, he is allegorized, or takes the first steps towards being allegorized, into a reformer of the moral life of the indi- vidual; I cannot think of any trace of a belief that he became, anywhere in antiquity, a spiritual king, head of a realm not of this world. An example he was to many, in various aspects, as the ideal Cynic or Stoic besides the ideal king, but he remains an exemplar of the good life in this world, and has little or nothing transcendental about him.24 Pfister's attempt to find a trace of the miracle-worker in Herakles is remarkably unsuccessful. He adduces the return from the expedition after the cattle of Geryon as told by Julian the Apostate,25 who rejects the voyage home in the cup of the sun, and declares that he walked on the water as on dry land, Ws Vrl ?p as s r OaXTrrts. But he forgets that we not only have here to do with the suggested improvement on the legend of a late and rather fanciful author, but that Julian was brought up as a Christian and was very well acquainted with the Old and New Testaments. He may be actually transferring the miracle of the walking on the Lake of Gennesaret from Jesus to Hera- kles. The many ramifications of the hero's legend agree in con- fining the miraculous elements, once his divine begetting is original story, has nothing particularly miraculous about it, since anyone standing on the shore might be able to see a shoal of fish invisible to those in a boat at a lower level. 2 Jesus iXOe k01Oiwv a alrivwv, Mt. 11, 19, expressly contrasted with John the Bap- tist's asceticism. 23 Dion Prus., orat. i, 84, is a good instance. 24 Epikt., diss., ii, 16. 45 (if you cannot rid the world of monsters, rid your own soul of evil passions, and thus imitate Herakles and Theseus). 21 Julian, orat. vii, 219 D.</page><page sequence="10">122 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW allowed, to special interventions of Zeus or Athena in his favor when he is in difficulties; he has no magical powers to eke out his prodigious strength and courage. Between the deaths of the two I can see no resemblance be- yond the fact that both are violent, and both victims show some natural shrinking from the end, overcome by heroic resolution. An attempt (p. 54) by Pfister to show some resemblance be- tween the accompaniments in the external world of the two events I cannot regard as happy. The Crucifixion is represented as accompanied with darkness, earthquake and the appearance of certain of the dead out of their graves; the nearest parallel he can find to this in the case of Herakles is some rantings of the pseudo-Senecan hero,26 who says that similar things ought to come, now that he is dying. That both Deianeira and Judas kill themselves is true, but not of very great moment; in both cases it is a natural incident, good fiction in the former and ap- parently fact in the latter. I cannot regard it as a close parallel, as Pfister (p. 53) does, that in the Fourth Gospel Jesus says Tr-cXEoaL (Jn. 19, 30) at the moment of death, while the pseudo- Senecan Herakles says peractum est some time before his end.27 Pfister himself admits that convulsions of nature are something very like common form in describing a noteworthy death; re- morse for the terrible consequences of an action, however well meant (as Deianeira's was and Judas' has been interpreted as being) is equally to be expected, and that when something is finished someone should remark that it is so is not extraor- dinary. Such slight resemblances in the telling of two stories, both of which contain the tragic end of a great figure, are only to be expected, and are more than outweighed by the very different atmospheres of the Crucifixion and the pyre of Mt. Oite. The immediate consequences of the two deaths are again not strikingly alike, considering that both contain the central feature of a revelation that the central figure has overcome 26 Herc. Oet., 1131 sqq.; cf. 1595 sqq., where the chorus are puzzled to account for the thunder-clap which announces the ascension of the hero. 27 Herc.

Both, in the later accounts of their deaths, die in the presence of their mothers and of a favorite follower (respectively the Beloved Disciple and Philoktetes), and the mother is taken care of, in one case by the actual son of Herakles, Hyllos, in the other by the disciple, who has just been informally adopted.28 It is worth noting, perhaps, that in neither case do these matters form any part of the original story. The Synoptic Gospels say nothing about Mary having been at Calvary, indeed imply quite plainly that she was not,"2 but the Fourth Gospel inserts her, and the incident of the disciple. Alkmene is brought in by pseudo-Seneca to posture before the pyre of her son; from the point of view of pure literature and good taste the Evangelist is infinitely su- perior to the rhetorician here, and much more effective, by reason of his brevity and reticence. Neither these, therefore, nor the parallel, such as it is, of the last (Johannine) Word from the Cross and the peractum est of the Latin play can throw much light on the sources of the Synoptic Gospels, whatever they may do for those of the Fourth. Much more important, and much more really alike, are the Ascension and the Harrowing of Hell. It is due to external circumstances that both follow the Crucifixion in the one case, while in the other the Harrowing precedes the death of Hera- kles. The hero's original legend had no Oite-scene, but made him victorious over death by his sheer physical prowess; he out-fought Hades (or Geryon, or the dragon of the Hesperides; all three are variants of the one theme)." Hence the original Herakles probably did not die at all, while the biographies of Jesus, let them be under whatever literary influences we choose to postulate, must allow for the historical fact of his having been put to death. His descent, therefore, into the lower world 31 28 This seems to be the meaning of 1iob, 6 v6ls -ov-L-iob, tj ATi7rlP o-ov, in Jn. 19, 96. 29 Mk. 15, 40-41 and Mt. 97, 56 give a list of names, not including St. Mary; Lk. 23, 27 gives no names but implies that they were all from Jerusalem. Jn. 19, 25 adds St. Mary to the list. 30 See M. P. Nilsson in Nordisk Tidskrift fir Vetenskap, Konst och Industri (1923), 123; Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, 547: Rose, Handbook of Greek Mythology, 215, 216. 31 There is no need to go into detail on this most interesting theme, which has been handled well and at length by J. Kroll in his excellent monograph Gott und Hille (Teubner, 1932).</page><page sequence="12">14 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW would come naturally after the Crucifixion and before the Resurrection, and its coloring took, with equal naturalness, a Semitic tone, quite different from the adventures of Herakles, though unconsciously echoing, in a faint and distant manner, those of Ishtar. Little is left by way of a parallel beyond the central feature, that one and the other went to the world of the dead (or of the evil powers, or both) and emerged victorious. There is a certain resemblance between the accounts of the two ascensions. The two Lucan descriptions 32 of Jesus' dis- appearance from earth say, in the one case, simply that he parted from the disciples and flew or rose up (a?e0Pe~ro) to the sky, the other that he rose from the ground before their eyes and was hidden by a cloud. This certainly suggests Apollodoros' description of the disappearance of Herakles from the pyre,33 except that his picturesque detail, thoroughly appropriate for the son of the thunder-god, that a noise of thunder accom- panied the miracle is absent from the Lucan account. Pseudo- Seneca also makes great play with the thunder-clap,34 which by the way is reminiscent of the disappearance of Romulus from Goat's Marsh.35 There is, however, nothing at all in the legend of Herakles parallel to the various epiphanies before the Ascension. By way of a postscript to his other parallels, Pfister draws attention to the similar ends of Mary and Alkmene. According to the legend, which can be traced to the fifth century A.D. and may of course be earlier," the Apostles were carrying out Mary's body for burial when angels came and took it away from them; hence there is no tomb to her memory, but only a cenotaph. There is quite respectable authority for a like story about Alkmene. Diodoros says briefly that she vanished and received rnai iLoOLo at Thebes;37 Antoninus Liberalis, who quotes Pherekydes as his source,38 is more explicit.

In a Christian legend which is certainly not very early, it is of course quite possible that a pagan story has been taken over with a change of names and places; it proves nothing for the Gospels. I think enough has been said to weaken Pfister's confident statement that we may feel certain about (mit Sicherheit be- haupten) the essential truth of his theory. But purely negative criticism is an unsatisfactory thing: a ~ ,t yap, says Aristotle,40 7?/uV TOU'TO O'TES, q 7rps 07rr0A 7r pa'7a y rot6o6ata rv ~?yrLY aXX Arpbs Tbv -rv-av'ria Xd'ovra. I wish now to discuss 7r6 rpya, not this or that critic's views of it. There are stories told about Jesus in the Gospels which bear a certain resemblance either to legends of Herakles or, I think rather oftener, to tales of other heroes or gods of non-Christian tradition. How may we best explain, not so much the presence of these non-historical elements, as their nature, the fact that they differ, on the one hand, from the no less picturesque accounts of such heroes of the Old Testament as Elijah, and on the other from the puerili- ties of the Apocryphal Gospels and other documents dating from a time when Christianity had had time to establish itself and develop a large mythology of its own? This much at least may be taken as certain, that the striking figure of Jesus provoked speculation about his nature long be- fore the theological theories of whose existence the proem of the Fourth Gospel gives us the best-known early example. The sober Marcan account,4" copied by the other synoptics, informs 39 The legend seems to have started from an actual unwrought stone in the precinct in question; but it is worth noting that to use a stone as a substitute for a missing body was not unknown in antiquity. For a grave containing just such a substitute, see J. H. S., Ivi (1936), 140. 40 Arist., de caelo, 294b7 sqq. 41 Mk. 6, 14-17; cf.

Whether we take this statement as historical or not for the date to which it refers, during the lifetime of Jesus himself, there can be no doubt that it represents early and by no means regularized thought about him; none of the suggestions is in agreement with Christian orthodoxy. Two of them make him out a more than human person, a glorified spirit at least if not an entirely supernatural being. In contemporary Greek phraseology, all were agreed that he was a Oeos avi'p of some kind. Seeing that the earliest converts, once Christianity began to spread outside Palestine, and even some of those in the primitive community at Jerusalem itself,42 were under the influence of Greek, or Graeco-Roman civilization to some extent at least, it is fair to assume some knowledge of Greek terminology and habituation to Hellenistic (not classical Greek) ways of thought, though hardly enough literary training or interest in Gentile philosophy for acquaint- ance with a philosophizing life of Herakles to be very probable. We must, then, if we are to visualize the way in which the non- historical elements in the Gospels came into being, try to put ourselves at the point of view of superficially Hellenized, not particularly well educated or critical people of the first century A.D. Although we know far less about that epoch and its thought than we should like, considering its importance, this much seems fairly clear. That a man should conceal under his human ap- pearance something of the nature of a god was a familiar idea, which took three forms, the first, as I see it, mostly a matter of mythology and quasi-literary belief, the others taken more seriously, one in the East and the other in the West. That a god should temporarily disguise himself as a mortal, the false doctrine against which Plato protests in the Republic,43 was an old enough idea, familiar in countless incidents of epic 42 The 'EXXYLtuTral, whatever exactly they were, of Acts 6, 1. 43 Rep., 381 d sqq.</page><page sequence="15">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 127 from Homer to Virgil and beyond, and from moral tales like that of Baucis and Philemon,44 in which disguised deities come among mankind to test their virtue and especially their hospi- tality. Some simple folk were quite ready to believe it seriously, like those Lykaonians who tried to worship Paul and Barna- bas; 45 but to the more philosophical and more skeptical disciple of Greek philosophy, even in its popular forms, it was, I fancy, no more than a literary figure, to express the presence of some- thing more than human, or at least normal human, power or goodness, as when Horace speculates on the possibility of Augustus being really Hermes sent from heaven to cure the evils of the day.46 More common, as a serious belief, especially in connection with royalty, was the semi-official or even entirely official declaration that this or that prince was a Neos Dionysos or the like, in other words a new manifestation of the god in question. It does not appear that this was associated with any clear ideas of how the manifestation was carried out; the result was believed in, but speculation as to the machinery which achieved it, if it existed at all, has not come down to us. I have elsewhere tried to show that the deity of such a person might be regarded as a detachable thing capable of quitting him and leaving behind nothing more than an ordinary human being.47 It further seems to be the case that such beliefs were taken seriously in the East rather than the West; Antony might be Dionysos while he was posing as Pharaoh of Egypt by the side of Kleopatra-Isis, but identification of anyone with a particular god, as opposed to the claim that he was vaguely divine, or on his way to become divine, seems to have been thought blasphemy or madness by the average sane minds of the West.48 Few, however, who believed in any sort of god or gods, would have denied the abstract possibility that a man might in some way have the makings of a god, or at least a daimon, in him, and some believed fervently in such possibilities. It might 44 Ovid, Met., viii, 623 sqq. 46 Acts 14, 11 sqq. 46 Horace, carm. i, 2, 41-44. 47 See Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology, xi, 25-30. 48 See the ancient judgments of the claims of Menekrates Zeus, collected in O.

A GOcos av@ip of one's own day would be such a contemporary, and it was no flattery and no figure to expect to find him showing signs, in his life on earth, of superhuman characteristics. If we now examine the patently non-historical events in the Gospels, i.e., those which, if we are to accept them as true, contradict all experience and all proba- bility derived from experience, we shall I think find that they simply correspond to the characteristics of a OcEos av-ip, and so may be taken, not as revealing the influence of this or that particular document, of Greek or any other origin, but merely, what I suppose no one would deny, that the story of the life and teachings of Jesus was told in the first instance by persons of no extraordinary abilities or more than very modest educa- tion, who therefore would be little likely to be superior to the ordinary presuppositions and prejudices of their own day. The first characteristic of the Oe6os avp, then, is that his be- getting and birth should be out of the common. Quite apart from such elaborations of this idea as we find in the official account of the origins of a Pharaoh,so we meet with the tale, modified to suit local and personal tastes, in connection with prominent persons of all kinds. It is, of course, almost regular for distinguished kings and emperors. The legend of Olympias and the divine serpent, in its various forms, is so familiar as to 49 For a summary of the reactions to Euhemeros on the part of the large majority who did not believe his theories, see R. de Block, Evhemere, son livre et sa doctrine, pp. 70-71 (Mons, 1876).

But it is not confined to kings; Aratos was the son of Asklepios, according to the Sikyonians,53 and some fancied that the piety of Scipio Afri- canus maior towards Iuppiter was that of a literal son.54 All these were statesmen, and so those who were not royal might be thought to have been assimilated to the honors and peculiarities of royalty. But philosophers were by no means outside the scope of the belief. That Plato was the son of Apollo and not of Ariston was a tale current in, or at all events shortly after, Plato's own lifetime,55 and Apollo again was declared to be the father of Pythagoras, how long after that sage's own times we cannot tell.56 But at all events the former story shows how quickly such ideas might spring up, and that in the most en- lightened community of Greece. Reputation for great wisdom was not necessary to start it going, if only the subject was prominent in some way; to be noble and a great athlete was enough, as we see from the quite circumstantial story of how Diogoras of Rhodes was begotten of Hermes.57 For a con- temporary of Jesus, of whom unfortunately we lack contem- porary information, we may cite Apollonios of Tyana, who apparently was not only Proteus incarnate but was begotten of Zeus and not of his mother's earthly husband.58 And, to come to the immediate environment of early Christianity, it certainly 11 For example, Plut., Alex., 2, 3. 52 Suet., diu.

Whatever the genuine Jewish thought of that age may have been, clearly the Christians of the first century were persuaded that the expected Messiah was to be a son of Yahweh, in some sense or other, literal or meta- phorical,60 and represent Jews as sharing this opinion. With all this to induce them, therefore, it would have been a very extraordinary thing if they had not represented Jesus as other than the son of two human parents. Precisely how old the legend of the Virgin Birth is, we have no means of knowing; but our evidence does not carry it back further than to a date when the one person who could have authoritatively contra- dicted it, Mary herself, was in all probability dead."' I have already shown that the story as we have it differs from that of Herakles in an important particular; I add that in the same particular (the abstinence of Joseph until after his wife's de- livery) it agrees, not only with the conduct of the mythical Oineus (see p. 116) but with that of Ariston before the birth of Plato (see passages quoted in note 55). So far, then, we have simply such telling of the story as would naturally be expected of persons impressed by the known facts concerning Jesus and putting them into the forms of narrative familiar to them from the very atmosphere in which they lived. With regard to the infancy and childhood of Jesus, the most remarkable thing, and the strongest argument against suppos- ing any conscious ornamenting of the story from literary or other sources, is the paucity of detail. Matthew has the picturesque tale of the flight into Egypt and the massacre of the 69 As Ps. 2, 7; Hos. 11, 1. 60 All three synoptics agree (Mk. 14, 61; Mt. 26, 63; Lk. 22, 70) in making the high priest, or the Sanhedrin generally, ask Jesus if he claims to be the Messiah and vilo r70 EbXO'7yroDv (70o OEoDv, Mt. and Lk., presumably as more easily intelligible). 61 Since Jesus was certainly born earlier than the conventional 1 A.D., Mary can hardly have been less than about 90 by that year; this would make her at least 90 by any probable date for Mark, and the story of the birth being in the two other synoptists only, we have no indication that it existed till a later date still, i.e., till she was either dead or in extreme old age.</page><page sequence="19">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 131 Innocents,62 which may be explained as sprung from a piece of contemporary gossip, true or false, about Herod added to a wish to find, what he continually looks for, the literal fulfilment of a prophecy.63 Luke has the story of the Child among the Doctors, which does not seem to be folktale at all, but rather an account, doubtless a little colored in the telling, of an actual incident.64 Both agree that persons of more than ordinary human wisdom (angels, Eastern sages, old and holy devotees) foretold the greatness of the child before or after his birth.65 This last, ex- cept for the earnestness and genuine beauty of the telling, is simply common form; for one instance out of many, we may compare the warning given by Nigidius Figulus to Octavian's father,66 again a learned astrologer, like the Matthaean magi with their star. I can see but one detail which suggests the ordinary folklore of a wonder-child; Luke might be taken as hinting, if no more,67 that Jesus' mental and physical develop- 62 Mt. 2, 13-23. 1 For the story of Herod, cf. Macrob., sat., ii, 4, 11: cum audisset (Augustus) inter pueros quos in Syria Herodes rex Iudaeorum intra bimatum iussit interfici filium quoque eius occisum &amp;c. The words intra bimatum compared with the extraordinary detail awrb eLro~S KaL Kar(XrWpc in Mt. 2, 16, when the rest of the narrative suggests that Jesus can have been but a few days old, strongly indicates that both are referring to the same incident. Macrobius gives no reason for Herod's murderous action; Matthew finds or invents a very good one, from the point of view of a folktale, that the king was trying to make away with a dangerous rival. The prophecy is of course contained in Mt. 2, 15, oddly interpreted out of Hos. 11, 1 (apparently the Hebrew text misquoted, for no in- genuity could get it from the LXX). 64 If I may quote my former article (see note 3), I still hold the view there expressed (p. 362): Jesus shows, in the story in Lk. 2, 42-50, 'just such self-reliance and intelligent interest in the religion of his country as might be expected in a boy of genius and deep natural feeling. . . . The hero of a folktale would have found his way by some mysteri- ous guidance to the Temple.... A wonder-child in a popular story would have con- futed the doctors of the Law, or at least made it clear that he knew all they did and more. ... To my mind, the tale cries aloud that it is a perfectly authentic happening.' 65 Mt. 1, 20-21; 2, 1 sqq.; Lk. 1, 24 sqq., 41 sqq.; 2, 8 sqq., 25 sqq. 66 Suet., August., 94, where also other omens of the greatness of Augustus are told. The story of the magi in Matthew is, as it stands, unintelligible, for it is impossible to say what they are supposed to be guided by, since it is called a star, and yet behaves like a luminous body not many yards above the ground (v. 9). It seems possible that Matthew had hold of a story to the effect that the magi discovered a royal nativity in the heavens (I am not aware whether any calculations have been made to see if there was one at any date reasonably possible for the birth of Jesus) and so were led, not by a literal star but by what the stars had shown them, to visit Judaea. 67 Lk. 2, 40; but he had used very similar language, 1, 80, about John the Baptist.</page><page sequence="20">132 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ment was quicker than that of ordinary boys. But at most it is a hint or an obscure indication of miraculously rapid growth, in sharp contrast with the thick crowd of legends which sur- round the infancy, for example, of Apollo or Gautama Buddha, or the miracles which the apocryphal Gospels insert into their account of his early days. Coming to the ministry, we are not now concerned with the recorded discourses and parables, but solely with the miracles; the credibility or otherwise of ascribing to Jesus the teaching which he is represented as giving depends, not on comparative study of popular ways of telling a story, but on our knowledge and estimate of contemporary Jewish thought and Jesus' rela- tion to it. Nor is there much to say of the most characteristic of the miracles, those of healing, for no more need be supposed than that Jesus, like many men of strong and impressive person- ality, could affect the minds of those whom he met, not least of neurotic persons or those hysterically simulating some disease. If this be granted, a little very natural exaggeration and orna- mentation in the telling of the stories will go far to account for everything of this kind contained in the Gospels; it is signifi- cant that, according both to the Evangelists and his own re- ported sayings, he attributed his success to the faith of those treated."6 We may perhaps look a little more closely at one story, that of the Gerasene demoniac.69 This man was subject to violent paroxysms of some kind, and so was regarded by his neighbors, and presumably by Jesus himself, as dangerously possessed by malignant spirits. That the patient shared this belief, as shown by his reply to the question what his name was, is highly probable. What his exact ailment was it might hardly be possible for the most expert modern physician to say, with so scanty a report of the case available; we do not know whether the cure was permanent or not, only that after the command to 68 As Mt. 13, 58 (but ibid., 17, 920 it is the operator, not the patient, who must have strong faith); Mk. 5, 34 (Mt. 9, 22, Lk. 8, 48). His cures cost him something in nervous energy, or whatever we like to term it; his own word for it is reported to have been tUapis, or presumably its Aramaic equivalent, Lk. 8, 46; no one who has ever calmed a nervous person needs to be told what this means. More examples can be found by con- sulting any concordance under 'faith,' 'unbelief' or their equivalents. 69 Mk. 5, 1-16; Mt. 8, 28-34; Lk. 8, 26-37.</page><page sequence="21">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 133 the supposed demons to leave him he became quite sane and calm. There probably are hundreds of men now alive and claiming no extraordinary powers but simply a knowledge of the treatment of neuroses who have had very similar experiences in their own practice,70 to say nothing of the remarkable results now and then obtained alike by faith-healers of a score of differ- ent sects and by the miracle-working shrines of various religions. Given, then, that the treatment, if we may so name it, applied by Jesus to this unfortunate man was as successful as the Evangelists say, the popular explanation would inevitably follow. He had had devils inside him, in the most literal mean- ing of 'inside,' and when constrained by a power superior to their own, they must have gone somewhere else in space. Being unclean, the most natural refuge would be the body of that animal which is most unclean of all to a Jew, a pig, and a Jewish miracle-worker would presumably have no scruples about in- conveniencing so detestable a creature. Hence the picturesque addition to the story, that they were allowed to go into the herd of swine and triumphantly succeeded in drowning it. Hence also the further detail, that the Gerasenes were at once anxious to get rid of Jesus, as being too dangerous to have in their neighborhood, lest he should let more devils loose. This analysis still applies if it should be proved that the whole story is un- historical and Jesus was never in that region; there seem to have been many other cases more or less similar, to judge from the passages which state in general that he cured an undefined number of demoniacs.7' We may then dismiss the miracles of healing as being most likely real events filtered through the popular mind in the telling and so graced with a certain number of details taken from folk- belief. Passing to the other miracles, again a very striking 70 If I may quote one personally known to me, a physician of my acquaintance, skilled in the treatment of this sort of case, had had great difficulty in doing any good to a neurotic woman, who had nothing organically wrong with her. At last he told her, as impressively as he could, that she would feel relief at a certain time the next day and afterwards continue steadily to improve. She obeyed him to the letter. It is obvious what a tale of miracle or witchcraft could have been made of this in an age more igno- rant than ours of the functions of the nervous system and its diseases. 71 As Mk. 1, 32-34.</page><page sequence="22">134 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW feature is their small number. I take the list as given in an orthodox Evangelical source, not to be suspected of trying to reduce their number, and they amount to a bare half-dozen, even assuming that the passing through the hostile crowd at Nazareth 72 is meant to be a miracle, and not the bold and effective action of a determined and fearless man in face of a mob without a definite leader and perhaps uncomfortably con- scious that their proposed action was none too legal. Two only are told in all the Gospels, and therefore may be assumed to have been so popular in the first century that no one could fail to associate them with Jesus. One is the feeding of the five (or four) thousand." But of all the stories told of him this is the most obvious folktale. Multiplication of food is a regular inci- dent in innumerable midrchen. The hero is required to make a variety of dishes from one small bird; 74 he has a magic basket or cauldron from which an indefinite amount of food can be got; 75 there is some kind of food (often a specific kind, bread, cake, rice, cheese, chestnut, coconut, apple) which renews itself ad infinitum, or a kind of pill which, once taken, satisfies hunger for years.76 Since a similar story was current in Hebrew tradition (Elijah and the widow's food supplies; later, he is given a few chupatties by an angel and needs no more food for forty, i.e., an indefinitely large, number of days)," this was probably the most likely to be attributed to anyone who had so caught the popular imagination as Jesus evidently did, and accordingly it was attributed to him. So far as I can now remember, it is not a feat ascribed to the heroes of classical tradition; we may there- fore perhaps call it Jewish in this case. 72 Lk. 4, 30. The author here does not indicate by a single word that he regarded the occurrence as a miracle, and to walk straight at a mob would be one of the most effective ways possible of daunting its members, each of whom would feel nervous about being the first to act. 73 Mk. 6, 35 sqq., 8, 1 sqq.; Mt. 14, 14 sqq., 15, 32 sqq.; neither of these authors is conscious that the two stories are doublets one of the other, but Luke appears to be, for he gives only one account, 9, 12 sqq. 74 Stith Thompson, H 1022.6, cf. 1022.5 (feeding an army from one measure of meal). 75 Ibid., D 1472, which gives a long list of varieties of this theme (vessel of some sort, tree, palace, kitchen, table, table-cloth, pot, cauldron, kettle). 76 Ibid., D 1652.1 sqq. 77 1 Kings 17, 11 sqq.; 19, 5 sqq.</page><page sequence="23">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 135 Less well known, it would seem, for it is recorded only in the First Gospel, is the story of the fish with the stater in its mouth."7 That this also is the product of folk-imagination is pretty clear, and this time we have something like it in Greek tradition, though with a different context, the ring of Poly- krates, which made its way later into Christian mythology independently, so far as we know, of the story in the Gospel."9 Fish are not particularly common as helpful animals, but they do occur, and a not unusual function of theirs is to fetch, in their mouths or otherwise, some valuable object which has been sunk in the sea. It hardly needs pointing out that in an age when navigation was so uncertain and perilous as it was in the first century the sea would be thought of, even more than in the age of Shakespere, as the repository of all manner of lost treasures, from which a mere stater could very easily be fetched, given some creature which knew where to look for it. More definitely implying power over the forces of nature are the incidents of walking on the water and stilling the storm. The latter, like the miraculous feeding, is in all the Synoptic Gospels,so the former in two,sl Luke perhaps feeling a little skeptical about it, as it would appear he is of two other tales which he presumably knew, the ones concerning the tribute-fish and the figtree. To walk on water implies one of two things, great speed (the person or object moves so quickly that it has no time to sink; possibly something like the children's pastime of 'skipping' stones may have helped to create this quaint notion), like the horses of Laomedon,82 or else, more commonly, supernatural power which rises superior to the ordinary rela- tions between solid and liquid bodies. The former is not implied in the Gospel story, the latter decidedly is; we can even see the 78 Mt. 17, 97. 79 Augustine, C. D. xxii, 8. For fish as helpful animals, see Stith Thompson, B 470, and for the bringing of the coin, B 107.4. 80so Mk. 5, 37-41; Mt. 8, 26-27; Lk. 8, 23-25. 81 Mk. 6, 47-52; Mt. 14, 24-35. As in both accounts the storm ceases as soon as Jesus enters the boat, it is fairly clear that this story is a development of the other, which perhaps moved Luke to omit it, as he did the other doublet, cf. note 73. 82 Iliad, xx, 228-229, whence Verg., Aen., vii, 810-811.

Indeed, considering that it is a fairly common dream- experience to find oneself moving over the most unlikely sur- faces with the greatest ease, it is not in the least remarkable that in the dream-world of mdrchen such things are said to happen to imaginary persons, and so on occasion are predicated of real men and women whose impressiveness causes them to be credited with supernormal abilities. The stilling of the storm we need not linger over, since it is the sort of thing which the most ordinary witch or wizard of popular belief, then and in many other ages, was thought able to do by the use of charms; for a great man wholly dissociated from miracle-mongering and much averse to it, yet credited with allied powers, we may instance Julius Caesar and the famous anecdote of his conduct during the storm on the Adriatic."5 The reasoning is the simplest and clearest, once the presuppositions are granted. The gods, or God, can influence inanimate nature in all manner 83 1 Cor., 13, 2, a passage which, while of course earlier than the existing Gospels, recalls the language of Mk. 11, 23 (Mt. 17, 20, Lk. 17, 6). But the idea is in no way exclusively Christian, cf. Virg., Aen., xi, 787, where the Hirpi Sorani perform their fire- walk freti pietate. The idea seems to be that the faithful follower of a divine power so surrenders himself as to become simply a vehicle through which any manifestation of that power's mana may show itself. 84 References to sundry forms of it in Stith Thompson, D 2125. Except for the form mentioned in note 82, this again seems to owe nothing to literary classical tradition, and therefore cannot safely be deduced from popular Greek philosophy. 85 Lucan, Phars., v, 577 sqq., Plut., Caes., 38. The story plainly was half-way to being told as a miracle, and probably would have gone the whole way if Caesar had con- trived to get to Brundisium instead of being forced back to Dyrrachium.</page><page sequence="25">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 137 of ways, bringing for instance good or bad weather at pleasure; therefore men can occasionally do the same, if they can per- suade a superhuman power to help them by prayer or other legitimate means, compel him to do so by wizardry, or them- selves possess some portion of divine power, in other words are Brlot. Nor need we spend time over the cursing of the barren figtree.86 Any curse, though spoken by the humblest and least OEtos of mankind, may on occasion be effective; how much more, therefore, the curse of one the power of whose words was continually shown by his curing people when he merely told them to recover, or bade the evil thing oppressing them to go away! We may therefore pass to the events connected with and following the Passion. To begin with the prodigies said to have accompanied the Crucifixion itself, it is to be remembered that Jesus was called a king by the title affixed to the cross and sentenced, so far as the affair was formally legal at all, for pre- tending to that rank. Not long after the Synoptics were written, some at least held that he had formally claimed kingship, but not in any earthly sense.87 Therefore it is only natural that what may be described as royal portents should surround his death, and it is reasonable to look for parallels among the mar- vels said to have accompanied the departure of great kings and emperors. We have no great difficulty in finding them. Accord- ing to the Synoptics, during the whole time of the Crucifixion there was supernatural darkness; 88 to ask whether this corre- sponds to any real eclipse of the sun at a date historically possi- ble would take us too far from the subject of this paper, and it is enough to note that only Luke explains it as an eclipse, which in any case could not possibly last for three hours. It is more to the point to remember that wonders are felt to be proper accompaniments of such an event, and are even apt to be in- 86Mk. 11, 12 sqq.; Mt. 21, 18 sqq. It is the only pointless miracle related of Jesus, all the rest being marvelous feats intended to benefit someone. Again Luke passes it over in silence, perhaps for that reason. 87 Jn. 18, 34-38, surely resting on something more than the author's imagination; such reports of interviews in their nature private are characteristics of popular accounts of important events. 88 Mk. 15, 33; Mt. 97, 45; Lk. 23, 44.</page><page sequence="26">138 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW vented when they did not really occur. There was no eclipse visible in Italy when Julius Caesar was assassinated, or at any date within that year; yet Vergil most plainly implies that there was,89 no doubt following some rumor which had had time to grow up in the few years (44 to not much after 37 B.C.) inter- vening between the event and his mention of it. Those who knew a little more astronomy contented themselves with some- thing less sensational, a paleness of the sun not amounting to eclipse but portentous. If we assume, and surely everything we know about early Christianity justifies us in so assuming, that the death of Jesus was as portentous and horrifying to his first- century votaries as that of Caesar had been to most Italians about a hundred years earlier, we can see at once why both parties made much the same assumption about the convulsion the event must have occasioned in nature. Another sphere where the death of a great and especially a royal person was expected to make itself felt was in a holy place of any kind, or among living things in some way holy. Thus, the death of Caesar was portended by the conduct of the horses he had consecrated, who wept and would not eat.90 The wel- come end of Caligula was foretold, among other such omens, by no less an object than the statue of Zeus at Olympia, which scared away the workmen as they tried to take it down by burst- ing into loud laughter,91 while the striking of temples by light- ning is as regular here as elsewhere when something out of the common is to take place. The rending, therefore, of the veil of the temple at Jerusalem 92 at the moment of Jesus' death is exactly the sort of portent of which one would expect to hear, for the general reasons given and at least two additional ones: firstly, that such a story would be very hard either to prove or disprove, and so has the character of folk-gossip already noted, and secondly that it is a symbolic omen (if the Holy of Holies is open, the temple is a temple no longer), and thus on all fours 89 Verg., Georg., i, 466-467 (ille ... extincto Caesare .. .caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit), plainly implying total eclipse at or soon after the murder.

There was a convulsion of nature, therefore the earth shook, ergo the graves were shaken open, ergo the abodes of the dead were ex- posed; not, as in the famous Homeric passage,95 the under- ground home of all the dead and their ruler, but the particular oLKS alvlos 96 of individual dead men, thought of vaguely as somehow living on in the places where their bodies had been put, a picture which has never left the fancy of mankind, down to the present day, despite the competition of more advanced and philosophical doctrines concerning the after-life. Conse- quently, there was an opportunity for the dead to come forth and mingle with the living; but it must have been the holy dead, for at such a time apparitions of the wicked ghosts would be most inappropriate. But in general, there is good ancient authority for saying that a notable death is attended or heralded by disturbances among the existing dead; one of the portents 93 There is a certain superficial resemblance, but no more, as the significance of the two objects was totally different, in the alleged rending of Athena's robe mentioned by Philippides ap. Plut., Demetr., 12, cited by Wetstein in his notes on Mt. loc. cit.; the occasion was the profanation of the Parthenon during Demetrios Poliorketes' visit to Athens. The Christian commentators of course did not fail to allegorize the rending of the temple-veil, e.g., Chrysost., hom. in Matth., 88 (89), 1, 825d-826a Monfaucon: 'rob)cTE b o 7 o o0 i6K &amp;vl3pi~Wv e's r70 va6v ...

This is probably nearer what was supposed to be signified by the rending in the first century than Jerome's interpretation (comm. in Matth., 27, 51, p. 236e Vallarsi): uelum templi scissum est et omnia legis sacramenta quae prius tegebantur prodita sunt atque ad gentium populum transierunt. He cites, ibid., from one of the early apocrypha a further portent: superliminare templi infinitae magnitudinis fractum esse atque diuisum. This is but one instance, where many might be given, of the rarity of the incredible in the canonical Gospels as compared with later imaginings. 94 Mt. 27, 53, adding that they did not appear till after the Resurrection. 96 Iliad, xx, 61-65. 96 For the lexicography of this phrase, see E.

Such incidents as the appearance of Apollonios of Tyana to the young man who did not believe in immortality 99 are extremely unsatisfactory illus- trations of the vivid epiphanies in the concluding chapters of the Third Gospel, to say nothing of the moving narrative of the finding of the empty tomb, with the added wonders in Mt. 28, 2-4, the frightening of the guard by an angel.100 What really happened to implant so strong a conviction in the minds of Jesus' followers so short a time after his death 101 is a question which, if ever it is settled at all, is likely to be settled by a psychologist and not a historian of religion; given the existence, which cannot be doubted, of the belief at an early date, every- thing else flows out of it in the most natural way. He was not dead, therefore he was not in the grave in which his body had been put; therefore the grave was empty, therefore someone must have found it empty, and also there had been a miracle, therefore a supernatural agency at work; and to people who had, ex hypothesi, no subordinate gods to postulate, the only possible mechanism was the presence of angels. The Ascension also follows from the same assumption, and indeed is a much more nearly commonplace story. If the skeptical capital could pro- 97 Suet., Vesp., 93. 98 Suet., Nero, 46. 99 Philostr., uit.

Cf. 1 Cor., 15, 4-8.</page><page sequence="29">HERAKLES AND THE GOSPELS 141 duce a man who had seen, or said he had seen, Augustus flying up to heaven 102 and even provide itself (presumably to impress the lower orders) with witnesses to the ascension of lesser mem- bers of the Imperial house,'"1 it would be very remarkable if in Palestine no one could be found who, thoroughly believing in the superhuman nature of Jesus, did not persuade himself, as well as others, that he had seen him go back whence he came. The details, as given in our authorities, are the most natural results possible of the inevitable attempt to form a mental picture of what had happened.104 Reviewing the whole evidence, then, we find no proof of the influence of any literary or popular philosophical source, such as a life of Herakles or anyone else, on the telling of the story, but much showing that the popular methods of thought and forms of imagination were active. To wish such things away, for the sake of getting a more objective account of the facts, would be to wish the narrators either not human at all or so highly trained in the sifting of Wahrheit from Dichtung as to be- long neither to their country nor their age. As in our own time it would not be possible, except among the most ultra-compe- tent specialists, to find any who could describe striking events and the reactions of men and women to them without using phraseology now current and showing the influence of such ideas as 'complexes,' 'economic factors,' 'anti-social actions,' 'de- mocracy,' 'Communism,' 'Fascism' and so forth, with their attendant host of catch-words, so it would not have been possible, at that time and place, to find religious-minded persons who could either give or imagine an account of the most re- markable happenings of their own day without introducing such elements of folk-thought and folk-belief as those I have pointed out. The impression made, on my mind at least, is that we are dealing, both when we examine the existing Evange- 102 Suet., Aug., 100. 103 Seneca, Apocol., 1, 2. 104 See note 32. It is perhaps worth while noting, with regard to the epiphanies which intervene between the Resurrection and Ascension in Luke, that they have at times something of the fluctuating inconsistent quality of dreams about them; in Lk. 24, 36 sqq., Jesus appears unexpectedly, after the fashion of a ghost, and then pro- ceeds to give proofs that he is a living man with a body of flesh and blood.</page><page sequence="30">142 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW lists and when we try to reconstruct their sources, written or oral, with thoroughly honest people, who told a story they entirely believed with no more than a minimum of the distort- ing medium through which every narrator, according to his date and environment, must see the events which he tries to record.</page></plain_text>
