Clark, Edward Jettner, Kennerly Digges, John Morris, and Daniel Cohen National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Davis Griffith MGA Research Corp. Akron, NY ABSTRACT The facial laceration test has been proposed as an addition to the dummy injury criteria of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. To better understand laceration oonditions as they actually occur, three road crashes of increasing severity, all involving facial laceration by the broken (cracked) windshield and one involving partial ejection, have been simulated physically and analytically. The physical simulations used vehicle test bucks, the Hybrid III head with the chamois facial coverings of the facial laceration test, and a piston - constrained Head Impactor. Computer simulations of the three crashes were also carried out using the CALSPAN 3D "CVS" and the 2D "DRISIM" computer programs. The computer simulations provide insight into the effective mass of the head and body on windshield contact, and the forces, velocities, and accelerations involved. The computer simulations show how the impact velocity and effective mass of the head can be much higher than expected, due to body kinematics and loading of the head by the body during windshield contact . These simulations help explain accidents in which the windshield was broken by head contact in a 7.5 km/hr (5 mph) crash, and in which the head was partially ejected in a 21 km/hr (13 mph) crash. The physical simulations approximated the damage observed in the three accidents. In addition, the reduced laceration and potentially reduced ejection by the use of glass-plastic glazing was demonstrated. This paper presents the views of the authors, and not necessarily those of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . IDEALLY, ANY SURFACE CONTACTING THE BODY IN A CRASH should deliver a load to the body less than the load that can cause injuries. All such surfaces contacting the body can be considered as part of the restraint system, ideally preventing any injury in a crash. In practioe, some motor vehicle surfaces meet this desirable goal of no injury at low impact speeds. However, many of the interior surfaces are too hard to meet this goal in moderate and high speed crashes. The formally named "restraints," such as safety belts, provide additional protection by reducing the liklihood of the body hitting hard interior surfaoes. Glazing (windshield and side, rear, and roof windows) represents approximately 26 percent of the occupant compartment outer contour surface in current model cars . This percentage increases toward 40 percent in some advanced car designs (1)*. Glazing as conventionally designed is a hard surface which, when contacted by the head, if it does not break soon enough can produce head impact injuries (skull fractures, concussions). If the windshield does break (crack) on head impact, it may produce laceration injuries, particularly disturbing if disfiguring to the face, and may allow subsequent ejection of a body part or of the whole body, if the plastic interlayer of the High Penetration Windshield (HPR) is deformed enough to be penetrated. Hence it is appropriate to consider glazing as a significant part of the "restraint" system. Laceration aspects have been proposed (2) to be added to the injury criteria of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (3). Safe glazing areas are * The numbers in parentheses designate the References, listed at the end of tins paper. 1.1359 0096-736X/88/9601 -1 359902.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">particularly important to the concept of softened car surfaces which provide protection without the use of occupant safety belts or air bags (4). Occupants without safety belts or air bags will frequently strike some part of the glazing areas during a crash event, and even belted occupants may strike the side windows or be struck by flying parts of glazing broken by glazing frame distortion during the crash. Kahane (7) estimates that there are some 427,000 minor laoerations and 14,000 more severe laoerations (Abbreviated Injury Soale or AIS 2 to 4) due to windshields per year of all motor vehicle occupants in crashes in the United States of Amerioa. In a 1981 study, using earlier less complete National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data, Partyka (8) estimated that there were some 200,000 windshield laoerations per year, with 29,000 AIS 2 and above, and some 100,000 side and rear window laoerations per year, with 8,600 AIS 2 and above, for occupants of only passenger cars that need to be towed after a orash. Clark and Sursi (5, 6) report that for 1983 fatalities and injuries in passenger cars in towaway crashes, some 35,000 people were wholly or partially ejected by all routes from the vehicle (about half in rollover crashes), of whom 10,200 were injured seriously or worse and 5 , 346 were killed. Of those killed or seriously injured by ejection, about half ejected through glazing areas (windshield and all windows, including side, rear, and roof) and about half through side doors. Clearly, the glazing "restraint" function offers opportunities for safety improvement . FMVSS 205, Glazing Materials (3), at present does not require a test related to laoeration effects, or head impact (HIC) effects, or ejeotion effects. Possible additions to the standard have been discussed (9), particularly to accomodate new materials such as glass-plastic glazing with greatly reduced laceration properties (10) and ejection reduction properties (6). The revision of FMVSS 205 in November, 1983 (11), permits the use of these new glass-plastic materials . In consideration of the additional injury meohanisms possibly needing attention, a Notioe of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was issued on April 12, 1985, which inoluded a simple facial laoeration test (2) and neck injury tests. A simpler test readout (12) was proposed than had been used for the "Triple* Laceration Index" method (13). In this simplier method, two ohamois are placed over the head of a Hybrid III dummy. In a 30 mph frontal barrier crash with the dummy in either outboard front seat positions in the ocoupant restraint system being tested, no cuts or tears or lacerations through this inner layer would be permitted. This laceration test, as well as the neck injury tests, have not at present been added to the standard. An objective of the research presented in this paper was to investigate the correspondence of lacerations as they occur on the road and the laoeration test with a dummy head. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH It was the goal of this research to identify from the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) (14), or the Washington Hospital Center head and neck injury study (15), and simulate physically and by computer models three road crashes of increasing severity. The selected crashes must have detailed crash investigations and hospital records, must involve facial lacerations by breaking or penetrating the windshield, and must illustrate effects over a range of crash speeds. The cases were selected, based on the above criteria. Physical simulations were then carried out with a head impact or device driving a dummy head against actual windshields in vehicle bucks. Computer simulations were carried out using two different computer models. THE HEAD IMPACTOR PHYSICAL CRASH SIMULATION In earlier work (12), a free flight head impactor (16) which allowed free head rotation on oontaot was utilized, at the NHTSA Vehicle Research and Test Center. In the current work, a piston head impactor, with constrained motion along one azis, was utilized, at the MGA Research Corp. The laceration simulation Head Impaotor (17) is the front half of a Hybrid III head rigidly mounted on a piston shaft , Figures 1 and 2, with piston shaft weights to simulate the desired effective mass of 6 kg (13 pounds, the minimum obtainable), 9 kg (20 pounds), or 18 kg (40 pounds). The head is covered in addition to its "skin" with two layers of ohamois of thickness specified in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that reintroduces a variation of the laceration test (2, 12). The combined thickness of the two chamois layers was proposed to be 1.5 +_ 0.1 mm (0.060 +_ 004 inches). It is noted that one study (18) indicated that the chamois examined tore slightly more easily than human skin. If the proposed Facial Laceration Criterion is met, this provides an additional factor of safety, to insure that a windshield broken by head contact yet not cutting through the inner chamois will be less likely to produoe moderate (AIS-2) lacerations in road crashes . 1.1360</page><page sequence="3">870320 y- HEADER. /- "WlKJDSwi ElD TlKrtE 2JEX0 C.ONT ACT SWITCH ACCELERATION SENICOR - ■ &amp; HCADFOtM &lt;' / INSTRUMENT &gt;SáL &gt;&lt;0'**T PAKI EL MECHANICAL MEAU)RE-' WU' V'' OF PENETRATION s?// k ļ ' PNEUMATIC / IMPACTOR h- / ř ļ ' /^^-WBOARD ABOARD w / I.

Diagram of the Piston - Constrained Head Impactor It was shown (16) that the free flight head impactor simulates the rotation of a dummy head striking a similar almost perpendicular surface, the upper A pillar (in which little body weight is transferred to the head for the unrestrained seated occupant) for the first 22 ms after the contact, although the force is simulated only for the first 12 ms, for upright seated A pillar contacts. Windshield contacts, because of the extended possible deformation before rupture of the plastic interlayer, may last for more than 30 ms, particularly for head impacts with the velocity vector not perpendicular to the glazing. It is expected that the depth of penetration into the deforming windshield surface would be similar whether there is head rotation or not. More importantly, in crashes with windshield contact following knee contact (especially in vans and small trucks, with more rigid lower dashes than passenger cars), the unbelted body tips forward, significantly adding effective mass to the head as it breaks and penetrates the windshield. By using pistons of varying weight, the Piston-Constrained Head Impactor could easily simulate this elevated effective mass effect. Other studies with free-flight body part impactors are noted (19, 20), with this same limitation that they cannot simulate the delayed effects of the body loading of the part making contact .

COMPUTER SIMULATIONS Computer simulations of the selected crashes were carried out using the three dimensional CALSPAN Crash Victim Simulation model ( CVS-3D) , version 20 (21), now installed on the NHTSA Office of Crashworthiness Research VAX computer (22). This is a lumped mass model, typically using 15 body segment masses and 10 vehicle surface areas. The improved VIEW graphics, developed at the U.S. Air Force Armstrong Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, are utilized (23). Computer simulations of these crashes were also carried out using the Fitzpatrick Engineering "DRISIM" (driver simulation) computer models. This model evolved from the earlier DRACR and PAC computer models. The early programs were government funded, for example, reference (24), but the final programs have proprietary additions (25;. These are two dimensional lumped mass computer models. The bodies have four masses: head, thorax, sternum, and pelvis/legs, allowing flexion between these segments but no simulation of neck and spine flexions within the segments. The airbag (not used here) has two masses, restrained and unrestrained, and variable inflation and venting options. Vehicle occupant compartment dimensions and some interior properties were obtained from MGA Research. Vehicle crash characteristics were obtained from the NHTSA vehicle crash data base, which includes more than 900 vehicle crash tests. The models were exercised to approximate the body contacts and surface deformations observed from the road crash vehicles. Particular attentions was given to the expected head contact position and attitude on striking the windshield, and the extent of vehicle surface and particularly the windshield deformations, of the road crash. The computer models give insight into the expected motions and forces which could have developed in the crash. THE ROAD CRASHES: 1. MODERATE LACERATION BY THE WINDSHIELD IN AN Ö KM/H (5 MPH) CRASH To identify the mild, moderate, and severe road crash cases to simulate for this study, computer listings of frontal crashes of NASS 84 (14) with facial laceration, and of the Washington Hospital Center study (15), were examined . A mild crash, with an initially estimated 6.3 km/h (3.9 mph) delta V giving an AIS 2 moderate laceration from the broken windshield was identified. This was of interest because the classical wisdom is that the windshield is not broken by head contact until the speed of the barrier crash with an unrestrained seated dummy exceeds about 23 km/h (14 mph) (for example, reference 10). These authors also give the vehicle (sled) crash speed for dummy head penetration (partial ejection) through the plastic interlayer of the standard HPR windshield as 35 km/h (24 mph) . NASS 84 case PSU 04 219P involves a 1975 G-30 Chevrolet Van of loaded weight 2141 kg (4719 pounds) which was proceeding north on a four lane undivided suburban highway at night in the rain. The right front passenger was a 44 year old male, 1.74 m (5 feet 8.5 inches) tall weighing 70.3 kg (155 pounds). The van was travelling (driver report) at the speed limit of 72 km/h (45 mph) in the right hand lane as it approached a four leg perpendicular intersection with another four lane undivided suburban road. The intersection is "uncontrolled," but has a yellow flasher beacon. The van slowed to 56 km/h (35 mph) at the intersection (driver report), where a 1979 Pontiac Sunbird of loaded weight 1277 kg (2814 pounds) entered the intersection from the east in the passing lane at an unknown (slow) speed. The right front of the van hit the left front fender of the Pontiac, which spun some 140 degrees (from the police crash diagram) out of the way as the van proceeded through the intersection, with the right side of the van also being contacted by the left rear fender of the Pontiac during its rotation. Figure 3 shows the van after the crash. Figure 3: The 1975 Chevrolet G-30 Van, after a right front collision with a Pontiac, with a corrected delta V of 8 km/h (5 mph). The right front passenger broke (cracked) the windshield with his head, experiencing an AIS 2 head laceration. 1.1362</page><page sequence="5">The unrestrained right front passenger of the van moved forward during the crash to receive a left knee abrasion, AIS 1, from the lower instrument panel, as reported by the passenger. Both knees left slight marks on the lower instrument panel, to the right of being centered for the passenger seat . With knee impact , the passenger tippped foward and broke the windshield with his head, receiving a 12 cm right temporal/parietal laceration of the forehead scalp down to the skull (AIS 2). (Breaking the glazing and cracking the glazing are used as equivalents. With the high penetration resistant (HPR) windshield, the plastic interlayer, which adheres to the outer and inner glass layers, initially prevents the cracked glass pieces from separating. With higher crash loads, the plastic interlayer may be penetrated or broken through as well;. Presumably, the passenger turned his head away from the crash as it developed, and so received the laceration on the right side of his head. The passenger was transported by car to an emergency room for treatment (emergency room record). The police classified the crash as "A," disabling, due to the severe laceration of the van passenger, who was away from work for 5 days. There was no reported neck injury. The driver of the van was uninjured, and the van could be driven away. The driver of the Pontiac had a headache, and was x-rayed, although "no injury" was identified. He also had a sore chest, probably due to the contact with the left front door, which had 2.5 inches of remaining intrusion after the crash, as measured by the Crash Investigation Team. These are AIS 1 injuries. The Pontiac had to be towed. The CRASH computer analysis of the change of velocity of the crash based on vehicle damage had been computed by the crash investigators to be 6.3 km/h (3.9 mph). This was recomputed using CRASH 3 (26) to be 8 km/h (5 mph), a speed generally not considered sufficient for head contact to break (crack) the windshield. For the physical simulation, a 1975 Chevrolet G-30 Van body was obtained and cut to provide a front buck, with windshield and dash. The first test (Test Gl) was with the Impact or with the head velocity vector 45 degrees above the horizontal and perpendicular to the windshield, with an impact speed of 8 km/h (5 mph) and an effective mass of 18 kg (40 pounds). (The van windshield has a rake angle (from the vertical) of 40 degrees. The buck was mounted tipped up 5 degrees, an angle not initially noticed since most of the floorboard had been cut away). First contact was with the nose, which is a soft structure with no metal support for the Hybrid III head. This broke (cracked) the outer 870320 layer of glass of the High Penetration Resistant (HPR) windshield, but did not break the inner glass layer, and so there was no laceration. This is a typical threshold windshield breakage condition, since glass fails sooner in tension than compression. This vehicle has a windshield mounting using butyl rubber. The double integration of the impactor shaft accelerometer , corrected for gravity and rebound, gave a displacement into the windshield of 4.6 cm (1.8 inches). Typically, displacements over 1.3 cm (0.5 inches) to 2.5 cm (1 inch) break (crack) the windshield if the mounting does not yield. Hence it is concluded that the mounting did yield in this test, since only the outer layer of glass was broken. The displacement was apparently reversible, and not noticed. A similar reversible separation probably occurred in Test G2 . A second physical simulation (Test G2 , Figure 2 above) was then made, again using the 18 kg (40 pounds) weighted head, with the head velocity vector 20 degree above the horizontal (i.e., tipped down 25 degrees from being perpendicular to the glazing), so that first contact would be made by the forehead, and not the softer nose. This broke both layers of the windshield glass, but with cuts only through the outer chamois layer (CLS 1). A third test was planned but not made, with the 18 kg (40 pounds) effective mass of the head striking the windshield at a slightly higher speed, to break both glass layers and cut both chamois layers (CLS 2), in better simulation of the road crash. The CVS computer simulation suggests that the effective mass acting on the head in this crash does increase to more than 18 kg (40 pounds), and that the head velocity (which rotates as the head tips down due to body pivoting after knee contact) becomes greater than the crash delta V of 8 km/hr (5 mph). The CVS simulation of the 8 km/h (5 mph) van crash, it is estimated that the initial contact with the Pontiac is a 30 ms pulse which removes 5 mph from the van speed at contact, followed by a 2 g deceleration during vehicle to vehicle contact as the Pontiac spins, followed by alg deceleration after separation with continued vehicle braking. The CVS simulation is illustrated by Figures 4, 5, and 6. The occupant motion in breaking the windshield is illustrated in Figures 4. The head acceleration and head effective weight (as loaded by the body) is shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively . 1.1363</page><page sequence="6">The CVS computer simulation (Figure 4) shows that the unrestrained right front passenger slides forward on the seat until the knees contact the dash at 195 ms, tipping the head and body forward, having lifted the buttocks off the seat . During the windshield contact , as shown at the 220 ms time interval, the thorax spinal axis approaches being perpendicular to the glazing plane, and the windshield breaks. The head is significantly loaded by body weight, with an effective weight of 36 pounds at 220 ms (Figure 6). This combination of body kinematics and body weight acting on the head helps to explain why the windshield can be broken and a deep laceration can occur in an 8 km/h (5 mph) crash.

(Head effective weight equals the head force on the windshield, calculated in the model, divided by the head acceleration. See Table 1 below). The effective mass of the head as loaded by the body as it penetrates into the windshield may be estimated from the CVS simulation by dividing the "Head Force" on the windshield by the "Resultant Linear Acceleration of the Head" (Figure 5) at the same moment in time, using the numerical rather than the plotted data. Due to its motion, the head has 5.4 gr before windshield contact, at 210 ms. Table 1 shows this time progression of the effective weight of the body acting on the windshield.

But for glass fractures at lower impact speeds and for the plastic deformation phase of windshield deformation, penetration, and ejection at higher impact speeds, these weights appear to be inadequate to simulate the windshield fracture and penetration for crashes of these types. For the DRISIM simulation, the head contacts the windshield at 150 ms, giving a HIC of 452, with a deformation through the windshield plane of 1.2 inches and a peak force of 3.30 kN (741 pounds). The femur load for each leg peaks at 2.66 kN (598 pounds). This model does not show as much rotation of the thorax as the CVS model does, and indicates less body weight transfer to the head, but it still indicates that the windshield is broken. 1.1365</page><page sequence="8">The results of a simulation using the DRISIM model is shown in Figure V.

MINOR LACERATION BY THE WINDSHIELD, WITH HEAD PARTIAL EJECTION, IN A 21 KM/H (13 MPH) CRASH Washington Hospital Center Head and Neck Injury Case 148 (15) involved a 1983 Chevrolet C-30 chassis/cab (Figure 8) with a flat bed truck back, which veered off the road at near 101 km/h (60 mph) (police estimate) and struck a dirt embankment parallel to the road with an approach angle of about 20 degrees (vehicle track analysis) with the left front bumper, with a vehicle change of velocity of 19.6 km/h (12.2 mph), as estimated by the CRASH computer program, recomputed by the CRASH 3 computer program (26), using vehicle deformation and track analysis, at 20.6 km/h (12.8 mph) . Figure 8: The 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck, after hitting a dirt embankment with the left corner of the bumper , and riding over the embankment , with a delta V of 21 km/h (13 mph), and with partial ejection of the unrestrained driver's head through the windshield. The truck climbed the soft dirt embankment , of 38 degrees initial slope (if a 90 degree approach angle) and an estimated 46 cm (1.5 feet) high (Figure 9) , to roll along the top of it for some 34.1 m (112 feet), hitting two dead trees without further vehicle damage in coming to a stop, with a pile of dirt and leaves deposited from under the front of the truck when it came to rest. The 29 year old 1.8 m (72 inches) tall male driver, weighing 81.7 kg (180 pounds), hit the steering wheel, hit and punched through the windshield with his head (partial ejection), with multiple AIS 1 lacerations and abrasions on the head and neck, hit the steering wheel again on rebound, breaking the hyoid bone support of his glottis, and asphyxiated and died. Figure 9: A view of the embankment hit by the 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck, with a delta V of 21 km/h (13 mph), with partial ejection of the unrestrained driver's head through the windshield. 1.1366</page><page sequence="9">870320 Figure 10: The interior of the 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck cab after the 21 km/h (13 mph) crash, with head partial ejection through the windshield. Figure 11: The windshield of the 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck cab after the 21 km/h (13 mph) unrestrained driver head partial ejection. Partial ejection through the windshield at a vehicle delta V of 21 km/h (13 mph) for an unrestrained seated driver is not emphasized in the literature, although Clark and Sursi (5) reported that fiftieth percentile male dummies totally ejected through the HPR windshield of a car buck stood on end when dropped vertically by the heals or in a seated position but with the spine parallel to the car X (longitudinal) axis when striking the windshield at 23.3 km/h (14.5 mph). Again, significant body weight behind the head lowers the speed for ejection. Physical simulation with the head/piston device weighted to 18 kg (40 pounds) was therefore examined, with the head striking the windshield on the forehead. The G-30 buck was used again, instead of obtaining a C-30 buck, after observing that the two had approximately the same 45 degrees windshield rake angle, and on the assumption that the windshield glazing had not changed significantly between 1975 and 1983. Initially, attention was not paid to the improved attachment of the windshield that occurred in this period. The first physical simulation (Test CI) was with head (forehead) contact at 20.4 km/h (12.7 mph), with the head weighted to 18 kg (40 pounds). The windshield separated, with no penetration through the glazing, as indeed has occured with the vast majority of complete ejections through the windshield on the road (7). It was determined that the 1975 G-30 van used the butyl rubber gasket method of windshield installation whereas the 1983 C-30 cab used polyurethane bonding, a far stronger attachment. A second physical simulation was made after attaching a replacement windshield with metal clips at the corners; in the impact, Test C2, the windshield still separated at the top. A third physical simulation was made after attaching the replacement windshield with metal clips and polyurethane in addition to the butyl rubber gasket, with forehead contact at 20.1 km/h (12.5 mph), with the head weighted to 18 kg (40 pounds), and with the head velocity vector 25 degrees below perpendicular incidence onto the glazing, to give forehead contact. Separation did not occur, but rather a partial ejection of the weighted head through the glazing, with cuts of the outer chamois but not of the inner : a CLS 1 laceration simulation of an AIS 1 laceration injury of the road crash. When the left end of the bumper and left wheel of the C-30 truck hit the dirt embankment, with the truck then climbing over the embankment , there was an upward acceleration, -gz in the proposed NHTSA dummy axes terminology (2), as well as the rearward acceleration (-gx) of gouging the dirt. This upward motion of the wheels "bottoms" the occupant compartment on the suspension and the occupant on the seat, presumably initiating some flexion (slumping) of the head and thorax. The rebound after the bottoming, and the further rise of the tires, throws the occupant compartment upward, and the occupant (driver) upward off the seat, probably contributing to the over-riding of the steering wheel to attain partial ejection in spite of the slumped body posture . 1.1367</page><page sequence="10">We do not yet have the experience with tire, suspension, and seat responses to predict the effect of this upward motion. Indeed, the simulations shown do not include this effect, with the consequence that the impact area on the windshield was higher than in the actual crash, The crash investigators observed no head or body contacts with the windshield frame or roof. Consequently, the vertical acceleration as the vehicle climbed the ban h was neglected in the simulation. The vehicle X axis acceleration from the bumper gouging the dirt embankment was estimated to peak at -20 gx (rearward) at 30 ms, then drop to 0 at 45 ms, with a total horizontal velocity change of 21 km/h (13 mph) . The steering system was simulated by three contact planes which represented the interactions of the steering rim to abdomen, the steering rim to thorax, and the steering hub to thorax. The force / deflection characteristics were assumed to approximate the properties of the human body components involved in the interactions, since there was no injury to the thorax or abdomen of the victim, and there was limited damage to the steering wheel. The kinematics of the occupant predicted by the CVS computer simulation are illustrated in Figure 12. 1.1368</page><page sequence="11">Figure 12: The CVS computer simulation of the 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck crash at 21 km/h (13 mph) with partial ejection of the unrestrained driver head. Contact of the neck with the steering wheel is surmised to have occurred on rebound, with fracture of the hyoid bone, asphyxiation, and death. 870320 The simulation shows that contact of the abdomen with the steering wheel occurs at about 50 ms. Contact between the knees and lower dashboard occurs at about the same time. These lower body contacts cause the body to flex forward, with the head / spine axis almost perpendicular with the windshield at 200 ms. The condition approximates the partial ejection of the head. The position at 230 ms illustrates the occupant rebound, with the neck approaching contact with the steering wheel, to give the hyoid fracture, asphyxiation, and death. Dividing the computed head force on the windshield by the acceleration of the head again indicates the effective weight acting through the head on the windshield. This effective weight rises from 12 pounds at 75 ms to 83 pounds at 160 ms, then falls. The windshield plastic interlayer deformation is greater with this body loading of the head than the deformation for a free flying headform or for a dropped 5 pound steel ball In our earlier work (5), dropping a fiftieth percentile (165 pounds) dummy head first onto the windshields of a car buck stood on end, we found no ejection with a 1.98 m (78 inch) drop (test 8), giving a contact speed of 22 km/h (14 mph), but ejection with a drop from 2.13 m (84 inches) (test 19), with the legs flexed in the seated posture, giving a contact speed of 23 km/h (14.5 mph). The driver of this C-30 truck weighed 180 pounds, a bit more than the dummy used. The DRISIM computer simulation is illustrated in Figure 13. This simulation cannot (by present DRISIM techniques) involve any dynamic representation of the up-load of climbing the embankment , so that engagement of the body with the steering wheel is greater than desired. The windshield breaks, but head partial ejection does not occur. The body flexion is less than expected, so that the effective mass of the head contact is less with this computer model than with the CVS model. Preliminary experimentation was made with assuming the up load partially flexes the driver and lifts him off the seat, starting the simulation from this position. This gave early head to windshield contact, but still not enough body angle to bring about partial ejection. 1.1369</page><page sequence="12">Figure 13: The DRISIM computer simulation of the 1983 Chevrolet C-30 truck crash, which involved partial ejection of the unrestrained driver's head through the windshield.

The third road crash of this road facial laceration series was NASS 84 case PSU 11 - 042V. A 2042 kg (4500 pound) 1977 two door Cadillac Coupe de Ville was driving late at night at about 64 km/h (40 mph) (passenger estimate) on a local urban street with two opposed travel lanes and a parking lane on the right but none on the left (vehicle occupant viewpoint ) . The driver was a 26 year old unlicensed female who had driven this car only some 48 km (30 miles) according to the owner - the right front passenger case occupant . The road was reported to be dry, but the scene photograph (Figure 14 - some days later) shows snow on each side of the street. The car veered left across the road, climbed a curb at about a 30 degree approach angle, and struck a 0.30 m (12 inch) diameter wooden utility pole just to the left of center of the bumper, breaking it off at a height of 0.30 m (12 inches), and coming to rest at the pole . Figure 14: The site of the 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville crash into a utility pole, breaking it off, with a delta V of 39 km/h (24 mph). The replaced 0.30 m (12 inch) diameter utility pole is shown. A curb is some 1.0 m (40 inches) in front of the pole. Figure 15 shows the 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville after the crash. Figure 15. The 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville after a 39 km/h (24 mph) impact with a pole, breaking the pole. The unrestrained passenger contacted the roof, expectedly extending the neck back, then broke the windshield with his head, experiencing an AIS 2 laceration on his chin. The 62 year old, 1.77 m (5 feet 9.5 inches) tall and 81.7 kg (180 pounds) weight , right front unrestrained passenger moved forward in the crash, breaking the heater vent below the dash, with a knee skuff marks on the lower dash, and with the chest apparently producing a small deformation, pushing the edge down, of the upper dash. The head made slight contacts, leaving hair traces, on the roof and sun visor, apparently extending the neck, so that windshield contact was with particularly the chin, giving an AIS 2, 6 cm long laceration on the left side of the chin as the windshield broke and bulged outward (Figure 16). Because of the head contact and extension of the neck, the chin contact with the windshield would be at a lesser speed than the 1.1370</page><page sequence="13">870320 vehicle delta V, and the effective mass of the head/body would be close to that of the head alone. The car had to be towed . Figure 16: The 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville windshield, broken by the right front passenger's head, after a 39 km/h (24 mph) pole impact. The first physical simulation (Test CAI) was with a 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville cut to provide the dash and windshield and support structures, with the head impacting the windshield with the head velocity vector tipped up 20 degrees from being perpendicular to the glazing, so that contact would be with the nose and chin rather than with the forehead. The head was weighted to the mininimum value for this equipment , 6 kg (13 pounds), and impacted at 31 km/h (19.2 mph) on the indication from the computer models that the head contact with the roof prior to head to windshield contact had reduced the head contact velocity below the vehicle delta V. The head broke both layers of glass and tore the plastic interlayer of the HPR windshield, although less than enough for partial ejection (which is scored for head ejection "at least to the ears" (10). This tearing of the interlayer by a 6 kg (13 pound) head at 32 km/h (19 mph) was not expected. It occurred with a final displacement of the head of only 10.5 cm (4.15 inches) into the original windshield plane, less than the 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 inches) of displacement expected before the plastic layer usually fails enough to allow ejection, suggesting that the plastic layer may have been lacerated. Only the outer chamois was cut through (CLS 1). In other tests, initial tears of the plastic interlayer were not observed until displacement exceeded 13 cm (5 inches) . The soft nose of the Hybrid III provides some face padding; it was decided in the second simulation (Test C2) to increase the head velocity vector angle to 25 degrees from perpendicular to the glazing, to give more contact on the chin and less on the nose, and to reduce the velocity of the 29 kg (13 pound) headform to 28 km/h (17 mph) to prevent the tearing of the interlayer. This indeed broke the glass without tearing the plastic interlayer, and both the inner and outer chamois were cut through (CLS 2) at the chin, simulating the AIS 2 chin laceration of the road crash. The Cadillac left front wheel rises over a curb before the car bumper strikes the pole. For the computer simulations, time zero is taken as the time of tire to curb contact. Contact with the pole is 50 ms after contact with the curb. The CVS simulation is illustrated in Figure 17: 1.1371</page><page sequence="14">Figure 17: The CVS simulation of the 1977 Cadillac two door Coupe de Ville pole impact , with a velocity change of 39 km/h (24 mph) , with the right front passenger breaking the windshield with his head and experiencing an AIS-2 laceration. The pole contact involves a decrease of forward velocity of 39 km/h (24 mph). The head makes first contact with the roof /header at 130 ms, causing the head to tip hack, with neck extension, and reducing the forward speed of the' head. The head continues to rotate, with full chin engagement with the windshield at 170 ms. The head motion continues parallel to the glass, with the chin leading the way, as shown at 190 ms in Figure 12. This type of motion would be expected to produce the chin laceration reported in the accident The head force on the windshield has a similar shape to the head acceleration during windshield contact, with an effective weight of about 6.4 kg (14 pounds), although with some oscillations The DRISIM computer simulation (Figure 18) was for a frontal crash of 26 mph delta V, using the "steering wheel" plane displacement to represent the dash distortion for this passenger crash simulation. (A dash distortion capability is not provided in the present DRXSXM computer model). Brief contact of the head with the sun visor /roof occurred at 115 ms (after adding the 50 ms to set the origin at curb contact), tipping the head back, with a peak angular acceleration of 3829 radians / s * s as the forehead hit the windshield at 130 ms with a speed of 32.7 km/h (20.3 mph). The face and chin then hit the glass as the head continued to rotate back, with the load peaking at 1.1372</page><page sequence="15">870320 60 gr at 175 ms, to give a HIC of 467 and a penetration into the glazing of 2.7 inches, enough to break the glass but not enough to penetrate through the plastic- interlayer .

The body position lines are drawn at 25 ms intervals. ADDITIONAL LABORATORY STUDIES: NO LACERATION WITH A GLASS-PLASTIC WINDSHIELD The Cadillac buck was used to demonstrate the laceration reduction capabilities of glass-plastic glazing. A standard HPR windshield was coated with 0.015 inches of polyvinyl butyral and 0 . 004 inches of polyethylene terephthalate by DuPont, similar to the "Inner shield" glass-plastic glazing developed by General Motors, Libby-Owens-Ford Glass , and DuPont , and provided as standard equipment on all 1984 Cadillac Seville Elegantes, on all Cadillac Seville models in 1985, and on all 1986 and 1987 Cadillac Sevilles and Eldorados, Buick Rivieras, Oldsmobile Toronados, and Pontiac 6000 STE's. This third Cadillac physical simulation (Test CA3) was with head contact again with the head velocity vector 25 degrees above the perpendicular incidence, to give chin contact, and again at 28.5 km/h (17.7 mph). The windshield again broke, but neither chamois layer was cut (CLS 0). Glass-plastic glazing in road crashes is showing its benefit in preventing facial lacerations from broken windshield glass (27, 28, 29). THE COMPLETE SET OF TESTS OF THIS STUDY (TABLE 2) , AND THE CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES (NOTES) In addition to the road crash Simulations Of this Study, ad/H-Hnnal physical tests were made of windshield fracture, penetration, and laceration, and ejection, using Jeep windshields. The complete set of tests is presented in Table 2, with accompanying notes to explain the conditions, and results observed. The rest of this paper, following the presentation of the data and methods, is a discussion of what has been learned about these glazing failure modes. Table 2 Notes: Tests J1 to J16 used the planar half windshield of the 1975 CJ5 Jeep, with the windshields mechanically clamped to the frame. J1 to J9 used windshields made by IGD. J10 to J16 used windshields made by Viracon, which we found to be thicker. Test Gl and G2 used the 1975 G-30 van buck and windshields made by DCL, with butyl rubber as the means of attachment . At the slow impact speed, the windshields were not separated from the frame at the end of the test, although indications are that there was dynamic separation in test Gl, for deflection was measured (in the bucks with a string potentiometer on the impactor shaft) to be 4.6 cm (1.8 inches; , yet only the outer glass layer of the HPR windshield was cracked. Test CI to C3 used the G-30 van again (in approximation of the 1983 C-30 truck cab), with windshields made by LOF. At the higher impact speed, the windshields CI and C2 had permanent separation after the test , until in Test C3 polyurethane bonding as well as butyl rubber bonding and metal clips at the corners of the windshield were used. Tests CAI to CA3 used the 1977 two door Cadillac Coupe de Ville buck, and windshields made by PPG. All of the windshields for Tests J1 through CA2 were High Penetration Resistant (HPR) windshields, of the total thickness specified. For Test CA3 , a glass-plastic windshield was used , as provided by DuPont , using a PPG replacement HPR windshield onto which was coated the inner plastic layers, of 0.38 mm (0.015 inches; of polyvinyl butyral and 0.10 mm (0.004 inches; of polyethylene terephthalate. In Test CA3 the windshield broke but laceration was prevented. However, the HIC was increased. Production glass-plastic windshields control the elevated HIC effect by using thinner glass. 1.1373</page><page sequence="16">Table 2 : Physical Simulation Tests of Windshield Laceration Test Weight Speed Angle Glazing Chamois Max T2-T1 HIC Status CLS (kg; (km/h) Deg .

Table 2 Notes (continued) : Note 1: Three head impactors, of effective masses of 5.96 kg (13.125 pounds), 8.96 kg (19.75 pounds) and 18.15 kg (40.00 pounds), were made, using piston shafts made of aluminum, steel, and weighted steel, attached to the back of the front half of the Hybrid III dummy head, whose forward or X axis is the piston axis. Note 2 : Speed of the piston-constrained head form impactor is determined photoelectrically just before impact . Note 3 : The angle the piston axis or head velocity vector makes with the windshield plane at the site of impact . Hitting the forehead involves an angle of 45 or 65 degrees. The 45 degree angle is with the impactor axis horizontal, eliminating the gravity effect on this axis , and the windshield at the 45 degree angle. (The 1975 G-30 van windshield, with a rake angle - measured from the vertical down to the windshield - of 40 degrees, and the front end buck were unintentionally tipped up 5 degrees in the experimental installation, so that the windshield angle was 45 degrees from the horizontal). Hitting the nose first involves the angle of 90 degrees. Hitting the chin first involves an angle of 115 degrees. Note 4: The total windshield glazing thickness was measured at four points and averaged. For the HPR windshield, this thickness typically includes an outer and inner layer of glass of equal thickness, near 3.2 mm (0.125 inches) in old designs but trending to thinner layers near 2.3 mm (0.091 inches) in new designs, plus a polyvinyl butyral plastic interlayer of 0.75 mm (0.030 inches) in old designs but trending upward to 0.95 mm (0.037 inches) in new designs (30). Note 5 : The chamois were obtained from Hydra Sponge Company, Inc. , 1033 Big Bend Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 63117, phone 800-325-9922 or 314-645-5411. They were hand selected for the proper thickness range by Mr. Tripalitis, according to the NPRM requirements (2), with a total thickness of the two chamois of 1.5 +_ 0.1 mm (0.060 +_ 0.004 inches) and each chamois measuring 0.8 +_ 0.2 mm (0.030 +_ 0.008 inches) at its center and as an average of five measurements, including one at the center. The inner chamois, against the 1.1374</page><page sequence="17">870320 dummy "skin," shall be the thicker of the two. The tabulation shown is the inner chamois thickness in mm followed after the slash / by the outer chamois thickness x 100. Note 6: The resultant acceleration used is the resultant of the shaft X acceleration and head Z acceleration. Filter class 1000 is used for these head acceleration measurements. Note 7: The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is calculated in the usual way (2). Since it is based on the measured resultant acceleration of the head, if the head is loaded by the body to give an effective mass greater than that of the head alone, the deceleration of this greater mass will be less than when the mass is of the head alone. Hence the HIC' s for the impacts of the 18 kg effective mass "head" are low, but the damaging force would still be high. The HIC when the head is loaded by impacts at an angle approaching the spinal axis is not an sufficient indication of safety, and for this reason, the neck loading injury criteria have been proposed (2). Note 8: The HIC integration times, automatically selected, are shown. Note that for the lower energy impacts, the glass contact or breaking spike (Tests J6 and Jl) is selected, but for the higher energy impacts, the longer duration HPR interlayer plastic deformation deceleration is selected. Note 9: The Status codes describe the windshield or head condition after the Test. B: Both glazing glass layers broken. B* : Both layers of glazing glass were broken for this glass-plastic glazing, but no laceration occurred. BO: Only the outer glazing glass layer is broken. E: Ejection. The head and piston have passed through the glazing. Because of shoulder contact , a dummy or human might not eject quite so easily. P: Partial ejection, with the head penetrating through the HPR interlayer "to the ears." S: Partially separated windshield, due to bonding separation at the periphery. SB: Partially separated windshield, with the glass layers also broken. T: Torn HPR plastic interlayer, but not enough to allow partial or complete ejection. Note 10: Distance of penetration through the contact plane of the windshield was calculated by double integration of the piston shaft X accelerometer , for Tests Jl to J16, and with a distance cutoff when the corrected velocity goes through 0 (so that rebound will not be included). For Tests Gl, G2 , Cl, C2 , C3, CAI, CA2 , and CA3 , a string potentiometer on the impactor shaft, with 0 set at glazing contact, was used. The glass appears to break with a penetration of 1.3 to 2.5 cm (0.5 to 1 inch). The plastic interlayer of the HPR windshield may be torn, but not enough to allow head ejection, with a penetration of 13.7 cm (5.4 inches), and torn enough to allow head ejection with a penetration of 22 cm (8.6 inches). The interlayer tearing in Test CAI, with the penetration of 10.5 cm (4.2 inches) is considered aberrant, with glass cutting the plastic rather than plastic failure in extension , presumably . Note 11: The Chamois Laceration Scale, references (1) and (12). CLS 0 is no punctures, cuts, or tears of either chamois. CLS 1 is outer layer cuts and punctures, sufficient to let light through when the tested chamois is spread out on a back-lighted glass, but no cuts or punctures of the inner chamois layer, although superficial marking may show on it . CLS 2 : Outer and inner layers with cuts and/or punctures. Any cuts, tears, or lacerations through the inner chamois would exceed the proposed (2) laceration injury criterion. CLS 3: Outer gashes (a penetration exceeding 2 cm in length), cuts (a penetration of 0.5 to 2 cm), and punctures (a penetration letting light through the chamois, but less than 0.5 cm long); inner cuts or punctures. CLS 4: Outer and inner gashes, cuts, and punctures. CLS 5: Outer and inner layers shredded. THE EFFECT OF HEAD TO WINDSHIELD IMPACT ANGLE Preliminary studies were made with the MGA Head Impactor using the CJ 5 Jeep windshield, an inexpensive planar windshield. Comparing the 6 kg (13 pounds) and 9 kg (20 pounds) heads impacting at 47 km/h (29 mph) and 49 km/h (30 mph) at 90 and 45 degrees onto the Jeep windshield, we see the consequences in Table 3. All four of these cases involved either the tearing of the windshield plastic interlayer (Jll), or ejection through the interlayer, so that the time of deformation of the plastic layer is truncated from what it would be if ejection had not occurred. We can see that when the head velocity vector is perpendicular to the glazing, a higher cumulative loading (HIC) occurs and there is lesser laceration than when the head velocity vector is at 45 degrees to the glazing. Presumably, the angled contact, even with the piston-constrained head motion, involves more lateral displacement against the broken glass pieces. See reference (30) for a detailed discussion of the glass fracture and laceration process. With greater body loading of the head, the nominally calculated HIC decreases although the peak head load (head mass x Max. g resultant) remains high. 1.1375</page><page sequence="18">Table 3: Effect of Head to Windshield Approach Angle Test Head Speed Impact CLS Max.

Double integration of the head Y or Z accelerometer readings indicate motions perpendicular to the piston-constrained axis of up to several inches, perhaps providing the lateral scrubbing effect against the broken glass edges which produces the lacerations. Nor is it a perfect unit mass, with co-linear X axis accelerometers giving the same reading wherever positioned on the piston to head axis. For example, Test J2, with head impact at 31.3 km/h, had a peak acceleration on the shaft of -65.8 gx, and on the head of -58.1 gx (acceleration rearwards), -15.4 gy (acceleration toward the left), and 57.5 gz (acceleration downward). Similarly Test J5, with head impact at 46.9 km/h, had a peak acceleration on the shaft of -109.4 gx, and on the head of -86.2 gx, 11.8 gy (acceleration toward the right), and 86.0 gz. The Y "rattle" (lateral motion) is small, and left or right in different cases, probably due to slight mis-alignment of the piston axis out of the plane perpendicular to the windshield at the noint of contact . With the perpendicular impacts, the Z head acceleration would expectedly be small, again presumably due to dummy face assymmetry or axis mis-alignment. For example, Test Jll, with head impact at 47.4 km/h, had a peak shaft acceleration of -128.7 gx, and head accelerations of -105.5 gx, 11.3 gy, and 39.6 gz. A more precise study of windshield failure modes will require more precise attachments, alignments, and measurements. A hemispherical front surface on the Glazing Test Device (6), rather than the front half of the Hybrid III head, would provide a less expensive test device giving more consistent results . The acceleration terminology used here is based on the dummy axis system proposed in reference (2). It is noted that this is different from the "physiological acceleration terminology" and axis system using the Gx (forward displacement acceleration) , Gy (rightward displacement acceleration), and Gz (upward displacement acceleration) unit vectors adopted by the aerospace medical community (31, 32). An effort is needed to standardize these terminologies and axis systems. THE ENERGY OF GLASS FRACTURE AND PENETRATION The effect of varying the weight and velocity of the head/piston system is interpreted in rough approximation to relate to the kinetic energy for breaking the glass, deforming the plastic interlayer, and finally tearing through the interlayer and ejecting. The "one half MV squared" relation for kinetic energy provides an approximate means to interpolate and predict the failure mode levels - assuming that the different samples of glazing have the same failure levels, or the differences are understood. (Actually, glazing of different thicknesses and especially different types, such as laminated, tempered, or glass-plastic, will have different failure levels). Changing the angle of incidence, or the friction (30) also changes the components of the forces parallel and perpendicular to the surface, and their time histories. Assuming that the energy of the perpendicular component of velocity of the piston/head system breaks the glass, we estimate that the energy of this perpendicular velocity component of a weighted head contact for fracture of both glass layers of the H PR windshield (near the condition of Test Gl) is about 50 joules (37 foot pounds). Indications are that at higher speeds of contact , the glass fracture level is elevated, so that indeed the kinetic energy fracture model is not totally adequate. It is the suggestion of Jerome Kossar, of NHTSA , that once the glass is broken, the plastic interlayer takes up all of the remaining energy, independent of incidence angle . Hence when the plastic interlayer is torn just enough for ejection (Test J3), the total kinetic energy (355 joules or 262 foot pounds) minus 50 joules (37 foot pounds) to break the glass, or about 300 joules (221 foot pounds), is absorbed by the plastic interlayer before penetration and ejection, for a head sized object. Expectedly with plastic flow, somewhat greater energy might be required to penetrate at higher speeds. These are very preliminary estimates, which we would appreciate being checked by the data on glazing fracture and penetration of other groups. 1.1376</page><page sequence="19">THE EFFECTIVE MASS OF HEAD TO GLAZING IMPACTS The body striking the windshield is far from a unit mass, even when the spinal axis is along the body velocity vector and particularly when the body velocity vector is not perpendicular to the glazing. Soft tissues deform, and jointed parts collapse. In reference (5), measurements are presented of the loads on a dummy head, chest , and pelvis , as the dummy is dropped from its heels onto the windshield of a car stood on end - as if it were striking the windshield in a frontal crash from the back seat. All the readings show oscillations as the dummy collapses, but with the spinal axis maxima being -46 Gz head (footward displacement acceleration or "eyeballs up"- see reference 30) at 88 ms, but with the readings confounded as the head flexes on striking the windshield, -24 Gz chest at 99 ms, and -17 Gz pelvis at 145 ms, indicating the damping and delay of the load as it is transmitted down the spine. The effective mass on the windshield is significantly less than the full body mass, at least until the internal body resonance effects and joint motion effects have faded, which apparently can take longer than 56 ms for low impact speeds at an agle to the impacted surface, in which forced "bottoming" of the elastic spinal elements is not occurring. When the plastic layer of the broken H PR windshield deforms, the shoulders make contact in perhaps 20 ms (depending on speed), reducing neck loads. The classical studies of these body posture elastic properies, for example (33), reporting the spinal resonance near 5 Hertz, should be reexamined, along with understanding the way the body collapses when stopped by a surface, in understanding this time progression of effective weight as the body is stopped by a deforming surface. But the primary message of this report is that the body, with the head striking the windshield, can deliver a significantly greater effective mass onto the windshield than the mass of the head alone , reaching over 100 pounds effective weight if the spine is close to being perpendicular to the glazing and has its velocity vector also perpendicular to the glazing plane. PENETRATION RESISTANT AND EJECTION The testing of windshields for "penetration resistance" with the 2.25 kg (5 pound) steel ball, as called for in FMVSS 205 (3) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard Z26. 1-1980 referenced therein, does not simulate the injury producing conditions of the crashes examined in 870320 this paper. The 18 kg (40 pound) weighted head did provide a reasonable simulation of the G-30 van laceration case, in which the windshield was broken by head contact with a vehicle delta V of 8 km/h (5 mph). And it also provided a reasonable simulation of the C-30 truck case, in which there is head partial ejection through the windshield with a vehicle delta V of 21 km/h (13 mph). Using the 18 kg (40 pounds at rest) weighted head for glazing plastic layer distortion events provides a reasonable approximation of the complex dynamic events of the plastic deformation and penetration. The acceleration of this mass during the abrupt glass fracture event will be less than with the 10 or 22 pound headforms often used to estimate head injury. It is our plan in our further work that the Head Injury Criterion of head to windshield contact be measured with a 4.5 kg (10 pound) 20 cm (8 inch) diameter spherical Glazing Test Device containing at its center three orthogonal accelerometers , and that laceration and ejection reduction be measured with the 18 kg (40 pound) 20 cm (8 inch) diameter Glazing Test Device (6). We also plan to continue the evaluation of ejection reduction qualities of attached-plastic glass-plastic glazing, and of the 18 kg (40 pound) Glazing Test Device. With this device, tempered glass of the side, rear, and roof glazing breaks at about 8 km/h (5 mph) and ceases to act as an ejection barrier. With this device, the standard High Penertration Resistant windshield is penetrated at about 21 km/h (13 mph). Preliminary data (5, 6) indicates that if the inboard plastic layer is attached to the glazing frame as a "safety net," movably for windows that open (6), the "attached-plastic glass-plastic" glazing can then resist penetration to over 32 km/h (20 mph). A HEAD TO WINDSHIELD IMPACT FORCE / DISPLACEMENT FUNCTION In this study, dynamic force / displacement curves for the head striking the windshield were produced from the data, with a double integration of the shaft acceleration giving displacement and the product of the resultant of the shaft X and head Z accelerations times the head/ shaft system mass giving force. Figure 19 is an example of these data, for Test J9, with the 6 kg (13 pound) head striking the Jeep windshield at 43.6 km/h (27 mph) at 45 degrees. At lower speeds, the fracture and plastic deformation loads tend to be smaller. Note particularly the indication of yield of the plastic interlayer, with the load decreasing when the deformation exceeds about 4 . 5 inches . 1.1377</page><page sequence="20">For the computer simulations, emphasizing the lower speeds, the force/displacement function used was 0 force at 0 displacement , increasing linearly to 318 kg (700 pounds) at 1.25 cm (0.50 inches), then decreasing linearly to 0 kg (0 pounds) at 2.5 cm (1.0 inches), the inertial spike of breaking the glass. The restoring force then increases to 181 kg (400 pounds) at 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) and to 91 kg (200 pounds) at 5 cm (2 inches), the inertial spike of the plastic interlayer to which the broken glass pierces are attached. The restoring force then increases linearly to 318 kg (700 pounds) at 11.4 cm (4.5 inches), then decreases with plastic yield to 90.7 kg (200 pounds) at 10 inches, at which distance the plastic interlayer is torn enough for head ejection. Actual windshields show considerable variation, so that these data should be considered preliminary. 1200.0 j- - 1000 x&gt; - f o 'ļ/s * $00X1 - * $00X1 - .2000 1 : ' ' 1 ' 1 1 ' I 1 1 1 1 1 ' 11 1 I 1 1 ' 1 * ' 1 1 11 " 00 Ł0 *0 6.0 6-0 10.0 1Ł0 1*0 wsPLACEver (»oes ) Figure 19: Windshield head impact force /displacement (Test J9) DISCUSSION Glazing makes up more than a quarter of the surface of the passenger car occupant compartment (1), and hence is potentially a significant part of the occupant restraint or packaging containment of the occupant without safety belts or an air bag. Glazing has three major safety failure modes: 1) It does not break, producing skull and brain and other body contact injuries. 2) It breaks, reducing body contact injuries but possibly producing occupant lacerations and puncture wounds, the latter particularly for unsupported plate glass and certain rigid plastics that break into long and sharp shards, not allowed in passenger cars. 3) It allows partial or whole body ejection, with subsequent injury from external surfaces, or the penetration into the occupant compartment of external objects. By adding an inboard flexible plastic layer to the glazing, to provide "glass-plastic glazing" of defined minimum qualities (11 J, with glass on the outside of the occupant compartment, and possibly with one or more layers of glass elsewhere in the glazing thickness, and plastic on the inside, with one or more layers, applied to all glazing of the passenger car, the lacerations can be essentially eliminated (10, 29). By attaching the inner plastic layer or layers as a "safety net," with movable attachment for movable windows (6), to provide "attached-plastic glass-plastic glazing," a significant part of the ejections can be eliminated. Many of the ejections occur in violent collisions, in which the occupant may be killed by contact against internal vehicle surfaces prior to ejection. Malliaris et al. (34; report, using NASS data, that about 56 percent of the harm of those ejected occur against internal surfaces prior to ejection. Kahane (7) points out that ejection through the windshield is less likely to be fatal than ejection through a side door. Of those ejected through the windshield and killed, he estimates that 70 percent receive their fatal injuries before ejection. Certainly the interior of the car must be "softened" to prevent this, as well as the glazing. The Malliaris et al. study (34) showed that contact with external surfaces or objects contributed 11.8 percent of the total passenger car "harm." A subsequent study (35), using NASS rather than NCSS data, gave external harm as 6.1 percent, although the difference is not yet explained, and, from trend analysis of NASS data, may not involve simply decreasing risk of ejection over the years. The CVS and DRISIM computer simulations were used in this study. Because the DRISIM model has only four body masses, flexing of the neck and trunk may not be adequately simulated, indicating less body weight acting on the head than may occur actually. Likewise, the present DRISIM model does not have the capability of including vehicle up loads during the crash. The CVS model allows the use of up to 30 segments to simulate the human body , and therefore offers considerably better dynamic representation. Also, with improvements in data handling (36, 37) and access to powerful yet inexpensive computers, the CVS model becomes increasingly easy to use. 1.1378</page><page sequence="21">CONCLUSIONS This study of three road crashes with facial lacerations, and their physical and computer simulations, and additional laboratory tests, shows the following : 1. There is a general consistancy between the simulated test results of the proposed Facial Laceration Test (2), evaluated by the Chamois Laceration Scale (12), and the laceration injuries suffered by the three occupants. 2. These tests showed that the proposed laceration test can distinguish between the human injury "Abbreviated Injury Scale" (AIS) severity code AIS 0 (no laceration injury), correlated with Chamois Laceration Scale CLS 0 (12), with no punctures or cuts of either chamois; AIS 1 (superficial laceration), correlated with CLS 1 , with punctures or cuts of the outer but not of the inner chamois; and AIS 2 (deep lacerations, into sub-cutaneous tissue, and greater than 5 cm long on the face or 10 cm long on the body) or more extensive lacerations, correlated with CLS 2 or higher values, with punctures or cuts or gashes of both chamois layers. In the proposed change (2) of FMVSS 208, a CLS 2 conditions of the dummy after a 48 km/h (30 mph) barrier crash test of the vehicle with a particular occupant protection system would be the basis for rejecting the system. 3. Observations of the test results presented in Table 2 indicate that if an occupant breaks a standard High Penetration Resistant windshield with his head with a relative contact speed for the perpendicular component of the head velocity vector above about 30 km/h (19 mph), lacerations greater than 1.5 mm deep 'may occur. These are CLS 2 lacerations, that is, there is penetration through both chamois layers in the dummy test . Human facial lacerations this deep and more than 5 cm long are classed as AIS 2, or moderate severity injuries. 4. In two of the road crash cases presented, significant body weight is behind the head on windshield contact . With body weight behind the head, the glass can break at a lower relative speed, even down to 8 km/h (5 mph), and partial ejection, with penetration of the head through the deformed and torn plastic interlayer of the windshield, can occur with a body contact speed onto the windshield of 21 km/h (13 mph). Without body weight behind the head, the classical values (10) of the speed of contact at which the head will break the windshield is about 23 km/h (14 mph) and the speed for partial ejection is about 35 km/h (24 mph). 5. Test data presented in Table 3 show that HIC values for windshield impacts with the head weighted to 9 kg are lower 870320 than for heads weighted to 6 kg. If body weight is acting to increase the "effective mass" of the head, the HIC value may not be a sufficient indication of head load, in interpreting head and neck injuries for example. Adding the injury criteria of neck loads, as proposed (2), would partially indicate this injury mode of the body weight acting on the head when it strikes a surface. 6. Computer modeling provides insights into the forces and motions which may have occurred in a road crash, helping to explain the injuries and identify the vehicle structures which if "softer" could prevent the injuries. We encourage an increasing use of computer modeling as an adjunct to crash investigation ( 15 ) . 7. The CALSPAN-3D Crash Victim Simulation (CVS) computer model apparently provides better simulation of crashes involving significant body flexion than the 2D DRISIM model. 8. The Piston-Contrained Head Impactor, in contrast to the Free-Flight Head Impactor using just a dummy head, can provide a simulation of the effects of body weight behind the head in loading impacted surfaces. However, the complex collapse characteristics of bodies against surfaces, with a complex time variation of effective mass acting on the surface, needs further study. 9. The use of the Hybrid III head in these tests produces variability of the impact speed for glass fracture, depending on what part of the head is hit first, for example, the hard forehead or the soft nose. A 20 cm (8 inch) diameter sphere covered with dummy "skin" and the two chamois, the Glazing Test Device used in previous work (6), may provide more consistant and less expensive results. 10. Tests with an 18 kg (40 pound) weighted head provide reasonable simulation of the ejection observed in the 21 km/h (13 mph; road crash case. 11. Glass-plastic glazing reduces lacerations, reducing body contact with the broken glass edges because of the inner plastic layer. Previous work (5, 6) has shown that attached-plastic glass-plastic glazing can also reduce ejection, through the deforming "safety net" function of the inboard plastic layer . 12. A preliminary estimate, based on the test results, is that about 50 joules (37 foot pounds) of energy of a head-sized object along the velocity component perpendicular to the glazing is sufficient to break (crack) the typical High Penetration Resistant windshield, and 300 joules (221 foot pounds) of additional energy along the resultant velocity vector into the glazing is required to penetrate (eject through) the plastic interlayer. 1.1379</page><page sequence="22">13. With body ejection through the windshield possible at less than 6.8 km/h (15 mph) , the "High Penetration Resistant" windshield is not really very penetration resistant for those circumstances in which the body weight can act behind the head. High penetration resistance was a big improvement when first introduced over 20 years ago (7), but the next improvement , with attached-plastic glass-plastic glazing in all glazing areas, can provide a further advance in reducing both laceration and ejection injuries and ejection deaths.
