<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harvey Pitcher. Responding to Chekhov: The Journey of a Lifetime. Cromer, Norfolk, England: Swallow House Books, 2010. Index. 290 pp. £13.50 (paper). Harvey Pitcher has written an intriguing and carefully considered account of his deep and abid ing interest since the age of seventeen in Chekhov the writer and Chekhov the man. This book has a polemical edge, an admirable independent spirit, and a number of shrewd judgments based upon reading, rereading, and re-rereading Chekhov's prose and drama. "I [...] see myself as an independent traveler, who has responded to Chekhov on a personal level and not been influenced by any literary theory or school of literary criticism, and as more of a 'generalist' than a 'special interest' visitor, always on the lookout for the overall patterns [...]" (Foreword, i). One must pause at the claim of "not been influenced" when one considers that Pitcher in his book refers to, criticizes, praises, engages in polemics with, or seeks support for his opinions from many well known Chekhov authorities such as, among others: Bartlett, Chudakov, de Sherbinin, Finke, Oilman, Hahn, Heim, Jackson, Karlinsky, Nilsson, Rayfield, S. Senderovich, Shakh-Azizova, V. L. Smith, and, particularly, Kramer, Popkin, and especially Kataev. Responding to Chekhov consists of a four-part Overview that is essentially the staking out of an approach to reading Chekhov and a condensation of what is to come, followed by twenty chapters of varying lengths that meander through Pitcher's close and devoted reading of Chekhov's work, concentrating on the mature prose that commences in 1888. Pitcher is in dis agreement with many recent critical approaches to Chekhov, for example Michael Finke's "many layers of a Chekhov text," or Robert Louis Jackson's "vast underground system of sig nals and synapses," or Julie de Sherbinin's "collection of Chekhov heroines called Mary/ Maria," or Savely Senderovich's "pointing to a number of stories in which the name George, Yegor or a derivative appears" (17-19). He finds these critical threads to be largely a reading into Chekhov's texts rather than a reading from them. He proposes passionately instead that there is "complexity and depth enough here without casting round for hidden meanings. We are the centre of Chekhov's world: this is the corner-stone on which all my writing on him, includ ing the present book, has been based" (23). Pitcher begins his careful exposition of Chekhovian themes, methods, and preoccupations by highlighting a series of stories dealing with death, in particular "A Dreary Story" (1889), "The Grasshopper" (1892), "The Black Monk" (1894), and "The Bishop" (1903). The frequency and</page><page sequence="2">650 Slavic and East European Journal intensity of the theme of mortality, seemingly heightened by the death of Chekhov's brother Nikolai (1889), and his own publicly unacknowledged tuberculosis, lead to a hyperconscious element within the stories and dramas, presenting an "ever-present threat to the ongoing processes of life, its inevitability, its finality, and perhaps most of all, the way in which it under mines and eventually topples the carefully constructed edifice of our self-image" (55). What Pitcher believes is being posited in these stories, with particular emphasis on "A Dreary Story," is Chekhov's exploration of "our problem [italics in the original, JK], [...] Nikolai Stepanovich has been carefully individualised—no actor could play the part—[Vladimir Samoilov actually does play the part rather well in a recent audio-book interpretation, JK], but the position he ar rives at, the uncertainty he feels, are not particular to him, but a heightened version of some thing we are all liable to feel" (59). Chekhov's mid-life crisis after the death of his brother Nikolai in 1889 and his subsequent ar duous journey to Sakhalin garners due emphasis. Pitcher, however, is sometimes given to sweeping generalizations. For example, it is asserted that "Chekhov's humanism can also be said to date from his Sakhalin expedition and to become firmly established thereafter for the rest of his life" (71). One can find almost at random humanitarian themes, particularly after 1884, when young Dr. Chekhov suffered his first blood spitting—"The Kiss" (1887), "The Steppe" (1888), "Agatha" (1886), and "Oysters" (1884) immediately come to mind—and personal actions, such as dedication to others, support of his family, medical help to many (often at no charge and involving personal sacrifice), that show the journey to Sakhalin and its aftermath to be part and parcel of Chekov's personal commitment to improving the lot of his fellow man. Pitcher is quite good at explicating the nature of Chekhov's satirical stories, from "The Grasshopper" (1892) to "An Anna Round his Neck" (1895), and "Ionych" (1898), which he de scribes as Chekhov's most "highly patterned story" (135). This facility is true as well of Pitcher's fine chapter (10) on what he calls "Chekhov's film script," the story "My Life" (1896). There, unlike in the satirical stories, Chekhov is able to depict an inner process of growth and change. The depiction of Misail cannot be described as a mere patterned repetition, but rather as the portrait of someone who "has successfully renounced his social position and all the auto matic privileges that went with it. He is self-supporting. He no longer sees his father. Heß treated with respect and even deference by the other members of the community" (168). Pitcher asserts that the ending of "Gusev" (1890) provides a setting sun that is "too reminis cent of old Hollywood films" (257). In my view he misses what Karlinsky observed, namely: "the device of subtly intermingling the soldier's speech patterns and his stream of conscious ness with the authorial voice" (Anton Chekhov's Life and Thought, U of California P, 1973, 183). Thus, "[A]nd just then up above, on that side where the sun goes down" (instead of "in the West") brings Gusev in death momentarily back to narrative life and comports with the aston ishing and exquisite anthropomorphic stream of painterly expression provided by the authorial voice in the story's coda. Nevertheless, Responding to Chekhov provides a sometimes pugna cious, yet always challenging and stimulating reading of Chekhov's texts. It should be on the bookshelves of all who admire Chekhov.
