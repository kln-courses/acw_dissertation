<plain_text><page sequence="1">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY THIS paper forms a brief and synoptic study of the use made by Greek thinkers of explanations and causes that lie outside immediate sense-perception; and of the extent to which these unperceived causes outstripped not merely sense but also common-sense, so as to become, simply judged in themselves, unexpected, improbable, or paradoxical. I propose first to examine the main Presocratic philosophers and their predecessors, to discover how far their theories exceeded the range of sense-perception on the one hand and common-sense on the other; then to assess more briefly the reaction of the Sophists, Socrates and Plato, with some consideration of Aristotle and his successors and special attention to the concept of teleology. The aim of this survey, from which much will inevitably be omitted, is to direct from a fresh angle a slender ray of light on the nature of Greek specula- tive thought-on the character of its dogmatism and the character of its assumed clarity. If philosophy is the search for causes, then it must soon concern itself with the unseen, with what lies beyond perception. Proximate causes of particular sensed events may be found in other sensed events; but the philosopher's attempt to explain man's experience as a whole requires the inference of causes and relationships outside the immediate range of direct physical experience. In assessing the nature of such inferences it is desirable to evaluate first the degree in which intangible entities and motives are explicitly recognised or at least accepted; secondly, the nature of their connexion with the experience which they attempt to explain; and thirdly, the extent to which the invention or determination of such causes is limited by common-sense-by intuitions of what is possible or acceptable as an appendage of our experience, and what is not. For example, common-sense might not prevent a man from believing that the sun is a large ball of fire, for to say that is simply to assign to it various qualities that we know from experience, qualities which may not coexist in any easily determinable object of our experience but which are not mutually contradictory. On the other hand the belief that the sun is made out of triangles, or is rowed across the sky with oars, may be felt to offend common-sense, because there are no obvious elements of our experience that can be combined without contradiction to form such a picture. The criteria of common-sense may, however, be suppressed in special circumstances: for example in a type of explanation that is professedly symbolical, or if the avoidance of a minor departure from common-sense seems to result in the necessity of accepting another and more important departure. Philosophers normally avoid hypotheses that are gratuitously contrary to common-sense, of that we may be sure. Yet they may be driven from the perceived world into improbable assumptions that are opposed to common-sense either by clinging too tenaciously to what seems to be pure reason or, on the contrary, by abandoning logic altogether and taking refuge in poetry or metaphor. At all events such 'improbable' explanations are an undeniable phenomenon in Greek and many other kinds of thought. The direction of the earliest Greek rationalistic speculation was strongly affected by preceding quasi-mythological beliefs, so that before approaching the Presocratics we should cast an eye at their pre-philosophical forebears. Now it is of the essence of mythopoeic thought that it soars beyond the seen or perceived world into the region of fantasy; yet Greek myths, as distinct from Miirchen or saga, contain less pure improbability, in the sense outlined already, than might be expected or may be generally assumed. Thus in pre- rationalistic Greek cosmography there is comparatively little that in its underlying non- mythical connotation is seriously at odds with the naive presentation of the senses. Sky,</page><page sequence="2">106 G. S. KIRK for example, is a solid bowl, perhaps supported by Atlas, man or mountain. Earth is rooted indefinitely far below, where are the subterranean waters and the abode of the dead. The sun sails back round the river Okeanos in a golden bowl: this is a piece of rather romantic aetiology which depends on the much more widespread and important idea that the flat earth is encircled by the river of Okeanos. The experiential basis of this concept is more complex than might at first appear. A surrounding salt-water sea might be inferred from voyages beyond the pillars of Herakles; but the idea of the fresh-water river must have been provoked originally not by Greek experience but by that of the river-cultures of Egypt and to a lesser extent Mesopotamia, where the formation of the world is exemplified each year by the emergence of the dry land above the receding flood-waters. The separa- tion of earth and sky as the first stage in cosmogony is another mythological assumption which at first sight seems contrary to common-sense. But when earth is envisaged, not absurdly, as a mother impregnated by the seed of sky, perhaps in the form of rain, then the complete physical union of the two parents may also seem possible enough; and if a single origin of the world is demanded, whether for simplicity or for still more anthropomorphic reasons, then an amalgam of earth and sky is not unreasonable as the originative unity. Greek culture- and vegetation-myths also, like those of Prometheus and of Demeter, have an unmistakable substratum of rationality. Some of them are non-Greek in origin, but even these tended to be moulded into typically Greek forms, and what was repellent was usually if not invariably rejected. In spite of the debts to Egypt that I have men- tioned, the most characteristic aspects of Egyptian mythopoeia were alien to Greek thought. There is no sign in Greece of the symbolist extravagances that flourished in Egypt, where the sky was indifferently seen as the under-belly of a cow, or as supported by four pillars, or by air, or by a crouching goddess; and where incompatible explanations were blended together with no thought of absurdity, so that across the belly of the sky-cow sails the boat of the sun. If the Babylonians and their neighbours were less surrealist than this, they were still far more tolerant of factual improbability than were the Greeks. Even the fantasies of Pherecydes of Syros in the sixth century B.c., unparalleled as they seem to have been in the rest of early and classical Greek thought, were kept under control. The wedding of Zas and Chthonie and the spreading of the embroidered cloth over the winged oak are based upon a rational view of the world and its parts. Only the fight of Kronos with the snake-monster Ophioneus is not readily explicable in terms of the evidence of the senses. Yet this is a version of the Typhoeus story as in Hesiod's Theogony; and these fights of gods with giants or monsters are another importation from the Near East-we may compare, for example, Hurrian-Hittite stories of the defeat by the weather-god of the dragon Illuyankas-and as they stand are not directly related to experience, though they may be used as aitia for phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes and so on. In origin they were often vegetation-myths representing the struggle of the new powers of spring with the decaying forces of winter. Greece in such cases simply borrowed the myth, attractive and yet improbable as it was, without necessarily emphasising or even recording the original significance. This, though, is the exception, and in general I would contend that mytho- logical fantasy in Greek contexts is surprisingly closely related to a substratum of significant if naive observation and experience. The earliest philosophers, in reacting against mythopoeic descriptions of the cosmos, naturally achieved a closer relationship with the evidence of the senses. Yet the apparently uncritical dogmatism of the Milesians, together with the bizarre appearance of many of their physical ideas, give the impression that they were not really much concerned with the sense-world, and even less so with what we call 'common-sense'. This is a wrong impression, however, because, given the initial assumption of unitary origin, derived from the genetic tradition of theogony, it is fairly clear that Thales' originative water and the aer or pneuma of Anaximenes were felt by them to accord with observed natural phenomena</page><page sequence="3">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 107 -even though Thales' choice was probably determined in part by Near Eastern ideas, and Anaximenes' depended on his naive view of the world as resembling an animal organism. The first philosophical recourse to an unseen arche completely outside our experience is Anaximander's apeiron, the Indefinite substance. This concept of an originative substance distinct from any in our world was not, however, an arbitrary one. It seems to have presented itself as the solution to a grave objection to the choice of a present world-con- stituent like Thales' water as cosmogonical source: namely, that the warring constituents of our plural and disparate world would never have been able to assert themselves against the limitless mass of a still existing originative material. A more real exception to the rationalistic nature of Anaximander's cosmology is seen in his anthropomorphic motive for natural change, of injustice followed by retribution. Yet the acceptance of animate moti- vation for the interplay of physical events, naive though it may seem, is a dominant charac- teristic of Greek thought down to and beyond Aristotle, as part of the unconscious heritage of the mythological past. Moreover, this anthropomorphic tendency is not in itself anti- natural, or even directly opposed to common-sense. Originally a reflexion of the incomplete separation of subjective experience and objective stimulus, it was perpetuated as a kind of classical escape-route from a variety of philosophical impasses, and has survived as a not sufficiently disreputable recourse for more recent thinkers. The only Milesian theory that seems to have far exceeded what is either allowed by the senses or apparently demanded by logic is that attributed to Anaximander of innumerable worlds. Most critics now follow Cornford in thinking that these were successive and not simultaneous. If so, they break the probable rule of retribution for excess, which should ensure the continuity, with certain fluctuations, of our present world. In fact, though, neither successive nor simultaneous plural worlds are motivated by the evidence of experi- ence, nor do they seem to be logically entailed by other arguments based on experience. I have advanced the possibility elsewhere that innumerable worlds were projected upon Anaximander by Theophrastus, who was led by Aristotle's discussion of infinity to accept that all who posited an infinite universe must, like the Atomists, have believed in worlds coming-to-be and passing away throughout the void. The doxographical evidence is confused, but is compatible with the hypothesis that what was assigned to Anaximander by Theophrastus was precisely the Atomistic type of innumerable worlds. If so, Theophrastus was misled partly by Aristotle, partly by the term apeiron, which for Anaximander almost certainly meant indefinite and not mathematically infinite, and partly by Anaximander's belief in cycles of the earth's surface. These cycles, however, were probably inferred from phenomena like the encroachment and recession of the sea and the succession of the seasons with their wet and dry periods. They represent a reasonable inference of unseen events with no tendency toward the improbability of innumerable separate worlds, which, especially if they are successive, are implied by nothing in our experience. With the Pythagoreans one passes to a different world of thought. They came to believe that the world is somehow made out of numbers. This number-physics, upon which we are regrettably ill-informed, seems to have resulted from an important new observation: that the musical scale is basically numerical. Now music was thought by Pythagoras and his followers to have special powers over the soul; and so the soul and then the whole world were gradually envisaged as being numerical too. This theory may imply an important presupposition which was certainly made at about the same time by Heraclitus: that it is the structure of things, rather than their material, that gives them their real unity. The Pythagorean theory, however, as opposed to that of Heraclitus, imposed upon the un- perceived structure of things a form that is startling and in many cases highly improbable. A thunderstorm or a lump of earth, for example, does not seem at all numerical. The details were obscure even to Aristotle, yet on no interpretation is the strangeness of the idea just whimsical or gratuitous or senselessly dogmatic. On the contrary, the whole</page><page sequence="4">Io8 G. S. KIRK theory seems to have been ultimately inferred from a valid discovery about the nature of music. Admittedly it is the immediate consequence of a very unscientific induction-If music, why not all things? Yet the over-bold induction is a favourite luxury of pre- Aristotelian thought. There was also, of course, a mystical and professedly non-rational side to Pythagoras and his school which undoubtedly aided any move beyond mere common- sense. Another whose interests were not wholly scientific was Xenophanes. Though many of his ideas were inspired by hatred of the dogmatic anthropomorphism of Homeric theo- logy, he also advanced certain physical explanations developed from popular beliefs, such as that men are made of earth and water, or the heavenly bodies of burning clouds. One of his theories, of the periodic drying-up of the sea on the evidence of marine fossils found inland, shows commendable observation and method. Others are rather absurd-for example, eclipses are caused by the sun wandering off into a region of the earth uninhabited by men. Yet in view of Xenophanes' undoubted acuteness in other respects these are probably to be explained not as gratuitous assumptions of the utterly improbable, as most critics have taken them to be, but as ironical parodies of the excessive dogmatism and naive theorisation of the Milesians. That he would not have departed needlessly from common- sense is suggested by his epistemological caution: 'Seeming is wrought over all things', he wrote, and 'no man knows or ever will know the truth about the gods and what I say about all things' (both fromfr. 34). Here he was giving new and clear expression to an idea popular from at least the time of Homer onwards, that man is fallible and that only gods have complete knowledge. This reserve had been jettisoned, with the Olympian gods themselves, by the Milesian philosophers. Xenophanes' counter-rejection of Milesian dogmatism is not easy to reconcile with the apparently confident description of his own rather peculiar deity. Yet the concept of one motionless god seems to me to have been determined by taking the very antitheses of the objectionable characteristics of the Olym- pians. Xenophanes perhaps did not intend to claim complete positive certainty here; but in his negative rejection of the Homeric description there was no reservation. That was presumably because he had proved this point by unanswerable argument, showing the inconsistency and absurdity of the anthropomorphic position: if cattle could draw they would draw their gods as cattle, and so on. Thus I infer that for Xenophanes certainty could after all be achieved about those truths, perhaps in his view only negative ones, which could be demonstrated by logic or reasoning. This is important because it paved the way for Parmenides' dogmatic confidence in the truth of his own logical conclusions, which from the point of view of common-sense were improbable in the extreme. Before Parmenides, however, came the important figure of Heraclitus. He was the first Greek philosopher whom we know to have made explicit reference to the unseen as some- thing vital to apprehend. 'The unapparent connexion is stronger than the apparent one', he said infr. 54, referring to the Logos common to all things. This connexion, this Logos, is accessible to all men but is not superficially evident. It is to be inferred as a result of intelligent reflexion on the evidence of the senses. It is the formular or structural con- stituent of objects, that which provides their essential unity by connecting evident opposites through measured and regulated interaction. This structural unity, which is closely related to a single material, fire, replaces the genetical unity of the Milesians. Heraclitus seems to have been the first to stress as a philosophical principle that the evident, the obvious, incoherent as it may seem on second thoughts, nevertheless leads men to the unseen, unevident truth. It is the soul, using the evidence provided by the senses, that apprehends the unseen Logos. The senses were not rejected by Heraclitus; rather he saw that their message has to be subjected to critical thought before it can lead to the real nature of things: 'Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for men if men have souls that do not understand their language' (fr. Io7). The Logos is not, in fact, contrary to sensation, it is implicit in it</page><page sequence="5">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 109 and explicative of it. Significant perception is probably caused by a physical contact between soul and object, by means of the fiery Logos-element in each. This Logos is hidden, partly because fools are rightly kept from the truth and more importantly because otherwise the opposed or 8ta~EpdoLEvov aspect of things, on which their unity also depends, would be endangered. Wise men must 'expect the unexpected' (fr. I8). Heraclitus re- quired much more than the negative kind of conviction that we assigned to Xenophanes, and he made certainty of a quasi-logical kind positive by giving it unseen, but not anti- natural or in this sense improbable, objects. His dogmatism here is thus less arbitrary than that of the Milesians, since by paying some attention to psychology and epistemology he had outlined a possible relationship between men and an unseen truth that was now explicitly recognised as such. So far I have not mentioned the famous opinion attributed to Heraclitus from Plato onwards: that everything in this world is in a state of continuous, and therefore often invisible, flux. This plainly involves a supposition which outstrips the evidence of the senses. If Heraclitus really thought this, it would be the second major case-the doubtful innumerable worlds in Anaximander being the first-of an apparently arbitrary transgression of the bounds of common-sense. I do not count Pythagorean number-theory here, since that arose naturally if illegitimately from a genuine observation. Of course the theory of continuous flux, likewise, has a real connexion with sense-evidence; but it goes beyond the senses and in many instances, unlike the Pythagorean theory, directly contradicts them. Why Heraclitus should have accepted this kind of improbability, and how far he really did so, is a problem that calls for a brief digression. How we are to interpret his categorical statement that the senses are good witnesses provided the soul understands their language? Perpetual flux is not necessarily excluded by this proposition, since the language of the senses might still be able to reveal that a kind of stability, namely the Logos, lies behind the flux. But what of the continuous flux itself: do our senses really tell us, in any language, that all phenomenal objects are constantly changing at every moment of time? The answer is, surely, No. They suggest precisely what was so frequently emphasised by the Greek poets, that all except the gods are ephemeral and that change overtakes everything else in the end. Some natural objects, mountains for example, might seem permanent enough, yet even these can be battered by earthquakes and scoured by water and fire. Yet for periods such things evidently do remain stable and unchanged, and the senses clearly suggest that objects like rocks or tables are not changing at every single moment. But, it may be argued, may not Heraclitus have made a bold induction from sense-objects that undoubtedly do change all the time, to the effect that all things change all the time? After all, he did not scruple to assume that, since pairs of objects are internally connected, all the separate pairs must be externally connected with each other. Yet it may seem doubtful whether in the present case there was any effective motive for the loose induction of literally universal change, and in particular whether the things that do continuously change were of a kind to suggest such an inference. Rivers, probably animal organisms, fire: these are the things that seem to have struck Heraclitus as being in strictly continuous change, while a large part of Nature stands on the other side to testify that although all or most objects eventually change, while some change all the time, there are such things as blocks or pauses in many parts of the cosmic battlefield. What seems to have impressed Heraclitus, though, in the notorious rivers offr. 12, was the underlying regularity of their flow rather than, or at least as much as, the significant or surprising quality of their constant change itself. Fire is a peculiarly important material, since Heraclitus describes the whole world-order as an ever-living fire. Yet parts of this cosmic fire are continuously being extinguished (fr. 30); parts of it are explicitly described as turning-for a time-into earth (6fr. 3I). Thus it is wrong to say that for Heraclitus all things individually are made out of fire and are therefore in constant change; it is the world-order as a whole that</page><page sequence="6">IIo G. S. KIRK is a fire, of which parts are temporarily extinguished but of which the whole manifests the regulated change that is so clearly exemplified in the process of combustion. Neither fire nor rivers, therefore, significant as they undoubtedly were, provide an adequate basis for pre- cisely the kind of illegitimate generalisation required for the assumption of literally universal flux. Nor do the invisible changes later mentioned by Melissus (fr. 8), perhaps with refer- ence to Heraclitus, provide sufficient motive for the assumption of constant and universal changes. The iron ring can be worn away-but by rubbing with the finger. Does this imply that iron is necessarily always being rubbed, and therefore always changing? Or in terms of opposites, the hard becomes the soft and vice versa; but need this transition have been continuous, for Heraclitus, in order to explain their essential unity? No: it may be spasmodic, so long as it is inevitable, just as the -rpocral or turnings of the world- masses of fr. 31, fire, water and earth, which effect their interconnexion and unity, are probably envisaged as occurring discontinuously in different parts of the cosmos. From the modern scientific point of view it is admittedly both natural and more economical to make change not merely ultimately inevitable but strictly continuous; but Heraclitus in his time was thinking of natural changes under the metaphorical guise of War or Strife, a vital stimulant which could seem then to be intermittent in its effects. Such are some of the internal difficulties in the attribution to Heraclitus of universal and continuous flux. Yet the fact remains that this attribution was made by Plato himself and accepted by all subsequent writers of antiquity. That is a most important fact, perhaps a critical one. If Plato was being accurate here, then Heraclitus must be accepted as having departed radically and from the point of view of logic unnecessarily from the kind of world- picture acceptable to common-sense. Most of his contemporaries would have hotly denied that literally everything in their experience was constantly changing; they would have found the concept of invisible flux repellent. They must have found it more absurd, indeed, than some of the dogmas of the Milesians: things might ultimately be made out of air, although they do not appear to be, since air evidently can assume queer and unexpected forms, and at least the hypothesis has the advantages of explaining an underlying material unity. But literally constant and ubiquitous flux seems unnecessary even for the different kind of unity that Heraclitus was seeking to reveal, and nothing but faulty logic argues, and that but weakly, that everything must be changing all the time as opposed to changing ultimately or some of the time. In fact the difference between these two conceptions, though important in its effect upon the world of common-sense, is largely one of emphasis, which is why I suspect that Plato was able to give a misleading picture. I do not believe that Heraclitus himself was likely to have posited constant and universal physical change, though this idea was one that could easily be derived from his emphasis on the inevitability and regularity of change and one that was so derived at least by the time of Plato's extremist mentor Cratylus. At all events Heraclitus' concern with strife, fire, rivers, and change between opposites was enough to suggest him rather than any other Presocratic thinker as the apostle of impermanence and flux. Against the apostle of impermanence Plato set the apostle of rest. Parmenides initiated a radically new line of thought by which the evidence of the senses must be utterly rejected in favour of a concept of Being which arose solely from the working of the mind on a single premise, 'It is'. This led to the conclusion that there is only a homogeneous mass of Being, and therefore no differentiation in the real world. The senses, therefore, are utterly mis- taken. Now from the standpoint of common-sense this conclusion is completely improbable and indeed utterly nonsensical. The unseen world discovered by Parmenides was as different as it could be from the evident world of our experience. Even more clearly than Heraclitus, Parmenides told the ordinary mortal that the real, philosophical truth made his activities look very foolish-for reasons which he probably would not understand. At the same time we must clearly recognise that the Eleatic conclusion about Being was the direct</page><page sequence="7">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY III result of a logical process of inference-admittedly an incorrect one-and that it was logic alone that led Parmenides to overthrow the world of common-sense. He formulated the choice that the philosopher must make if mind and senses are opposed: he must abandon the comfortable world of the senses and plunge into one that is not only unperceived but also, if necessary, completely improbable. Apart from the Eleatics themselves, philosophers were utterly dismayed by Parmenides' conclusion and refused to accept it in its entirety. They were consequently forced to make compromises with the senses, compromises which involved highly complicated accounts of the natural world but which avoided, on the whole, the grossly improbable. It was Empedocles who first attempted to preserve some part of the world of appearances while accepting the Eleatic rejection of Not-Being. He detected four root-materials, fire, air, water and earth, which do not come-to-be or perish-and thus they preserve the inviola- bility of Being-but combine in different proportions, together with the motive substances Love and Strife, to give rise to physical objects. He also envisaged a four-fold cycle of the whole sphere of Being, according to the amount of Love or Strife that was active within it. To understand this unseen order of Nature men must be selective in the use of their senses; they must 'comprehend each thing in the way in which it is clear' (fr. 3, I3). Even so mortal knowledge is limited-though Empedocles, like Parmenides, evaded this irksome restriction by placing himself in a state of divine revelation. Now although Empedocles' account abolished the major improbabilities of Parmenides' Way of Truth, and to a con- siderable extent reinstated the world of our experience, it nevertheless included a great deal, in the four stages of Love and Strife with the corresponding intermediate cycle of animal evolution, that has the appearance of being purely speculative and arbitrary. This appearance is deceptive, however; for he proposed this cyclical complication for a very good reason, to give the plural world a Parmenidean unity. Having envisaged a stage at which everything except Strife was mixed up in a homogeneous and unified sphere clearly modelled on Parmenides' Being, Empedocles could not make this unity an initial cosmogonical state, since that might seem to involve coming-to-be. He therefore made it a periodic stage in a never-ending cycle. For since there had to be two contrary motive substances there had also to be an opposite condition to the unified stage, one in which Strife was completely in control; and there had to be two transitional periods. To fill the evolutionary periods corresponding with these Empedocles was persuaded to include such things as solitary limbs wandering about disconnected from bodies, and monsters like man-faced oxen- progeny. It is important to see that all these rather quaint ideas, far removed as they were from the world of common-sense, were initially imposed upon Empedocles by the demands of symmetry in working out his cyclical scheme, itself necessitated by his premises of essential unity and no becoming. Doubtless he was encouraged in his evolutionary theories, like Anaximander before him, by a strong interest in the origin of living creatures; but the point I wish to stress is that the major 'improbabilities' of the Empedoclean system were not chosen gratuitously but were thi result, as was the case with Parmenides too, of following an initial axiom to its apparently logical conclusions. It is notable that after Parmenides far more attention is paid to perception and the relation between mind and senses; for the anti-Eleatic reaction was based on the conviction that the perceived world can be valid, provided that it can be satisfactorily related to a single unperceived metaphysical structure. New ideas on perception, stimulated by increasing medical interest in the fifth century B.c., occasionally influenced theories on the nature of external reality; but more frequently theories of perception were themselves tailored to fit prior beliefs about the necessary nature of the world as a whole-a procedure rather typical of the a priori tendencies of Greek thinking. Empedocles, himself a medical man of a kind, was able to support his assumption of the conditional validity of the senses by his theory of pores and effluences. This theory, apparently elaborated from an observation</page><page sequence="8">112 G. S. KIRK by Alcmaeon of Croton, appeared to give a solid physical basis to the evidence of the senses while still allowing for error. It is, of course, a special form of the assumption of physical contact between common elements in the psyche and the outside world which is seen in Heraclitus and also in Parmenides' Way of Seeming. Even though the theory may seem at first sight rather improbable, rather repugnant to common-sense, yet like the Pythagorean number-theory it was ultimately based upon valid observation; and unlike that theory it was developed to corroborate the world presented by the senses, or at least some important aspects of it. It must further be remembered that any detailed account of sensation itself necessarily includes much that is far from obvious. Sensation confronts us with the evident by means that are quite un-evident, and all descriptions of it, even modern ones, contain conceptions that are unfamiliar, often improbable, and certainly far removed from the normal sphere of common-sense. Empedocles' near-contemporary Anaxagoras likewise tried to circumvent the Eleatic elenchus by a pluralist theory allied with the assumption that apparent coming-to-be is caused by the aggregation of eternally-existing forms of matter. He held that all the natural materials in the universe were to be found in different proportions in every one of the seeds, particles or lumps which combined to make up sensible objects. He was forced to suppose that every component particle, however small, contained a portion of every natural substance, and possessed the apparent character of that substance which had the predominant portion. This theory, even though it had the merit of explaining the mystery of nutrition-how bread, for example, can turn into bone and flesh-must have seemed inherently improbable, as well as intolerably complex, to the common-sense view of in- terested amateurs. Once again, however, we must recognise that a degree of improbability was inevitably entailed by the attempt to retain the sense-world at all-not in its most naive aspect, but as giving a 'sight of the unseen', an 5 7 -r-ov caoiwov (fr. 21a), and thus providing a basis for something like knowledge. The Atomism of Leucippus and Democritus was simpler and therefore at first sight more attractive than Anaxagoras' theory. Yet it followed Pythagoreanism in taking a momentous step awayfrom the phenomenalworld of common-sense: for all natural substances were completely abandoned. Sense-perception now had to be accepted as possessing nothing but secondary or derivative truth. It presented no part of the ultimately real, only the practically real. Yet the practical and the theoretical were closely connected; for only the intelligent man, he who knew that the effluxes of atoms from objects were liable to distortion both by the medium through which they passed and by the mind-atoms on which they ultimately impinged, could judge his own behaviour, and the world as a whole, more or less correctly. Thus, as for Heraclitus, a knowledge of the unapparent constitution of things was necessary for reasonable, and indeed for ethical, living. In Atomism, however, although the arrangement and shape of atoms were all-important for the differentiation of objects and the determination of their behaviour, the unity of things was due essentially to their material, as the Milesians had believed, and not to their structure as in Heraclitus and perhaps the Pythagoreans. This material type of unity, though admittedly easier to describe and superficially to comprehend, is ultimately harder to reconcile with the manifold world of experience. Once again, though, the theory depended from a chain of reasoning, one which owed much to that of the Eleatics. It was the apparent cogency of this reasoning that gave Democritus the confidence to proceed beyond the senses and establish, much more clearly than his predecessors, a sharp division between the 'genuine' knowledge of the mind operating on perception and the 'bastard' knowledge produced by the naive acceptance of sense-data alone (fr. I I). Meanwhile the Sophists had reacted in their own extreme way to what ordinary men no doubt considered, as the Clouds of Aristophanes suggests, as the extravagant absurdities of philosophers. Protagoras' dictum 'Man is the measure of all things, of the existence of</page><page sequence="9">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY I13 the things that are and of the non-existence of the things that are not' seems to me to be mainly directed against the improbabilities of the Eleatic creed: how, that is, can man be certain of a truth that excludes man ? The world is anthropocentric and must be explained so as to take account of man and not to deny him; Being and Not-Being must be assessed not by remote intellectual rules but by the more human evidence of the senses. Gorgias too indirectly attacked the theoretical extremism of the physical systems, and he too held that certainty was confined to things within men's immediate reach. These Sophists made the attitude of ordinary men the basis of a scepticism that damaged all metaphysical systems and left the individual as the only valid arbiter. In this they were creating, it may be said, a new kind of improbability; but to them human affairs were all-important, and philosophy and religion were strongly criticised because they were other-worldly, they focused attention on objects that were unseen, indemonstrable, and almost intolerably remote. An abnormal representative of the Sophistic tradition was Socrates. Like the Sophists he turned from scientific dogmatism to the study of man. He did so not only because of the complexities and inconsistencies of current physical theories, but also because these failed to explain the world in terms of soul or reason, for Socrates the only possible principle of order. His interest in man, therefore, was quite distinct from that of the Sophists, since he thought the important thing to be not practical virtue so much as purity and efficiency of the soul. This was a development of a Pythagorean idea. In metaphysics, too, Socrates made an important contribution, as Aristotle saw, by his realisation that the objects of philosophy must be definitions or common factors and not isolated concrete instances. This had already been felt to some extent by the Presocratic physicists, but they were still prone to infer from one or two conspicuous cases instead of considering the relevant quality of all similar examples. Now when Plato came to promote Socratic definitions into separate metaphysical entities, he was motivated not so much by the confusion of earlier physical theories as by the apprehension that their object, the external world, was notably change- able, particularly according to Cratylus' extreme brand of Heracliteanism, and therefore that definitions immanent in matter were no longer a possible object of unchanging know- ledge. And Plato, like Socrates, accepted the existence of unchanging knowledge as axiomatic. Thus the Sophists rejected the complex improbabilities of the physicists by refusing to attempt to explain the physical world at all; Socrates followed suit, but in turning from the practical to the psychic aspect of man, and in correlating coherence with the operation of mind, he perpetrated what seems from one point of view to be the grave new improbability of teleology; and finally Plato was led rather like Parmenides to reject the sensible world as the object of philosophical inquiry in favour of a remote unseen reality quite opposed to anything suggested by common-sense, this time of Form-causes which had no intelligible way of causing anything. Plato's rejection of the sense-world was more moderate than Parmenides', however, since he evidently felt that this world, though not fully real, somehow partook of reality and was a kind of poor relation of the real world of Forms. But while Parmenides' Way of Seeming may suggest that he felt some com- punction in abandoning the world of common-sense, Plato accepted its ontological degrada- tion almost without apology, certainly without explicit discussion; for by his time the secondary status of common-sense was more or less taken for granted. He too was sup- ported by logic, in his case primarily the logic of the argument from the existence of un- changing knowledge. Yet it was evidently not only the examination of his logic but also the application of a sturdy scientific common-sense that led Aristotle, not unlike the pluralist successors of Parmenides, to react against the excesses of idealism and restore the phenomenal world to something like its proper place in man's schematisation of his experience. Now an important advantage of the supposition that the true reality is an unseen one, closely related to but not identical with the sensed world, was that knowledge of this kind</page><page sequence="10">114 G. S. KIRK of object, for instance the Logos of Heraclitus or the definitions of Socrates, is not susceptible to an objection that may be aimed at so-called knowledge of phenomena: namely that different men have different experiences of the same physical event, so that their 'know- ledges' contradict each other. This difficulty was a commonplace of the new comparative ethnology and sociology, and its consequences were drawn in drastic fashion by the Sophists. The theoretical worlds of philosophy, on the other hand, claimed a kind of reality which, once comprehended, could not be doubted and was the same for all. Parmenides equated knowledge with Being itself: you can only validly say or think what is. Unfortunately his Being excluded the sense-world, and so knowledge became completely divorced from sense- evidence and utterly contradicted essential parts of man's nature. The post-Eleatic pluralists, therefore, were at last compelled to give a detailed account of man's apprehension of the world, so as to lay a firm foundation for knowledge of the new and more complex type of unseen reality that was designed to replace the abhorrent Eleatic plenum. Par- menides had founded his knowledge on logic, and any rival type had to be at least as strongly based as his. But in fact his conclusions were attacked not in their logic, which was at first broadly accepted, but by recourse to a seemingly more direct type of knowledge founded upon the assumption of physical contact between the psyche and its external environment. There are many difficulties in all this, but none in my view surpasses that of the unquestion- ing confidence subsequently manifested by Socrates and Plato themselves in the very fact of absolute knowledge. Here Socrates accords not with the Sophists but with the dogmatic physicists, though he did not follow them in giving knowledge the basis of a physical contact between soul-stuff and perceived object. For although he and Plato accepted knowledge as a datum, no full-scale attempt to describe its nature is known before Plato's Theaetetus, though the problem had been touched on in the Charmides, Euthydemus, Meno and Cratylus. Even in the Theaetetus Plato merely discussed an incomplete set of possibilities, somewhat crudely formulated, with the real intention of illuminating not the nature of knowledge itself so much as that of its objects. We apparently have to accept, then, that Socrates and Plato adopted and maintained a narrowly empirical approach to knowledge, by which it was treated as a self-evident psychological fact. This attitude, which contrasts so oddly with the anti-empiricism of some of the conclusions Plato drew from the premise about knowledge, is akin to the naive assuredness of unphilosophical man and lacks even the degree of self-analysis implied by the sayings of a Heraclitus, 'I sought-for myself' and 'You would not find the soul's boundaries however far you went; so deep a Logos has it' (frr. 45 and IOI). Now the knowledge which for Socrates was virtue was primarily knowledge of one's own soul and its activities. This knowledge did not have to extend far beyond the human moral environment, and Socrates specifically rejected the knowledge aimed at by the Presocratics and with it the kind of'improbability' with which we have been chiefly con- cerned so far. The fundamental idea of the Socratic doctrine, though this had an appear- ance of novelty and a genuinely new ethical application, already had a long history. 'Virtue is knowledge' is implicit, for example, in its wider aspect, infr. 16 of Solon: 'Most difficult is it to apprehend the unapparent measure of judgement, which alone holds the limits of all things'. The idea is more fully developed in Heraclitus, for whom the know- ledge required was one of the true plan or structure of all things: 'The wise is one thing, to be acquainted with true judgement, how all things are steered through all' (fr. 41). But Socrates, who spurned the intricacies of physics and sought only for professedly simple teleological explanations in terms of mind or soul, limited the knowledge that man must acquire to the narrow confines of human society. For science this restriction was damaging indeed. Yet it did at least have the effect of placing what was judged to be the highest kind of knowledge within the possible reach of the majority of men, and thus making philosophy less exclusive than before. Plato reversed this potentially profitable trend by</page><page sequence="11">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 115 making knowledge accessible only to the few-as it had been in the hey-day of the sophos, the divinely-inspired sage or poet, and as it had been for Parmenides and Heraclitus. Plato made knowledge the perquisite of the intellectuals, of the Guardians, for example, in the Republic. In a way this conception revived the valuable idea of Heraclitus that knowledge of self cannot be divorced from knowledge of the principles behind one's total physical environment. Yet whereas in Heraclitus the idea was compatible with a rudimentary scientific attitude, Plato's application of it was ultimately no less anti-scientific, and entailed more questionable assumptions, than the Socratic view of knowledge, since in its extreme form it led to the conclusion that things in this sub-lunary world are no possible object for knowledge or scientific study at all. Then at last Aristotle re-directed knowledge towards the common-sense world of our experience. He identified its object as Form, as Plato had done, but as Form that is immanent in natural objects and therefore not unnatural or other-worldly. As a scientist he tried to do what Plato had avoided or at least perverted: to show how mind makes contact with natural objects through their specific forms. But his detailed psychological theories were unfortunately so difficult, and apparently so vague at important points, that they left many people, including the Stoics, dissatisfied. They, the Stoics, were in addition temperamentally and logically averse from the transcendental conception of deity in Aristotle as in Plato, and so they returned to Heraclitus' idea of a divine principle or Logos immanent in things. This allowed them to retain the new teleology, yet it seemed to provide a more solid foundation for ethics as well as a better explanation of perception and knowledge. To this extent the early Stoa improved even on Aristotle in returning towards philosophical probability and a real world not utterly repugnant to common-sense. Yet the workings of reason, supported sometimes by irrational traditions, produced fresh affronts to rationalism, such as their acceptance of divination and their belief in cosmic recurrence. Such deviations from the expected were less extreme, however, than those entailed by the truly anti-scientific attitude of the in many ways admirable Epicurus. With his atomic swerve and his principle of indifferent alternative explanations for natural events Epicurus established the physically improbable as preferable to the psychologically insoluble. The swerve made nonsense of the observable physical law that heavy objects fall in a straight line, partly at least with the purpose of reconciling Atomism with the inade- quately-investigated phenomenon of free will. Alternative explanations, however attractive they may seem to a modern scientist, further undermined the study of the principles of cause and effect-which had already taken punishment from Plato's propensity for myth-and so once again subordinated physics to ethics in a way which would have warmed the cockles of Socrates' heart. My survey of the continuing oscillation between the demands of common-sense and the extremities of philosophical theorisation would be incomplete without some further assessment of a concept which more than any other inhibited the potentialities of classical Greek science: I mean the concept of teleology, the idea that the whole world is somehow fulfilling a purpose formed by a superhuman mind. Teleology is a luxuriant offshoot of the anthropomorphic tendency which Greek philosophy inherited from mythology and religion and never completely threw off. In popular religion it was the gods, Zeus above all, who ruled the world by the application of larger-than-life human motives. In Anaxi- mander change was kept within bounds by the sociological metaphor of retribution for excess, and for Heraclitus the motive of natural change was the anthropomorphic stimulus of War or Strife, to which Empedocles, following the tradition of Hesiod's Theogony, added Love. Even Aristotle, when rational induction broke down, fell back again on the metaphor of Eros. After Socrates it was only in Aristotle and his immediate followers, including Theophrastus and the Stoics, that this kind of anthropocentric rationalisation was not strongly detrimental to scientific inquiry. The great logician occasionally indulged in a</page><page sequence="12">116 G. S. KIRK masterly illogicality, and according to Aristotle the purpose being fulfilled in the world was one formed by no mind but unconsciously pursued by Nature herself. This allowed Aristotle to proceed with physics. In Socrates and Plato the teleological principle had been applied more damagingly. The causes of events were to be explained by describing not the mechanism by which they occurred but why it was best that they should do so. This summary is necessarily an over-simplification, yet it remains broadly true that Socrates and Plato tended to go straight for ultimate a priori causes like soul or the Form of Good and to ignore the detailed study of most physical events. Concomitant causes could still be studied in the light of exalted metaphysical principles, but we have only to look at the Timaeus to see what the results were likely to be. Aristotle's scala naturae at least allowed mechanical causation to be studied empirically at the lower levels of the natural progression. Arising as it did from common anthropomorphic attitudes, teleology was no new dis- covery by Socrates but had gradually developed among his predecessors and contemporaries. Thus by about 425 B.c. Diogenes of Apollonia could write of his basic substance, air, as follows: 'Without intelligence it could not be so divided up that it has the measures of all things-of winter and summer, day and night, rains and winds and fair weather. The other things, too, if one wishes to consider them, one would find disposed in the fairest possible way' (fr. 3). This idea of the measure of natural cycles leads back again to Heraclitus. To him, too, the regularity of the world, underlying the superficially incoherent plurality of experience, had suggested a metric or regulative constituent of things which was described as steering them, perhaps as intelligent. That the world was interpenetrated by a kind of divine life was an assumption certainly made by Thales; and it was against this kind of background that the explicit idea of mind disposing all things gradually developed. Heraclitus exemplifies a transitional stage at which cosmic intelligence simply produces a predetermined regularity, much as in Anaximander the principle of Dike ensured the balance of opposed world-constituents. Dike and Logos are structural laws, from one point of view, determining events as it were from behind, rather than a purpose or end drawing them on from in front. They had a predecessor in the Moira or destiny which even the gods could not contravene. But it was when Anaxagoras called the Logos-type of regulative constituent 'Mind' that Socrates became excited, because mind implies cosmic purpose rather than mere regularity-principle. Thus although the seeds of Socratic and Platonic teleology are present in the Presocratic period, there is an essential difference: for the directive constituent in Heraclitus, Anaxagoras and Diogenes is still a physical material, and its results can be studied physically; and that which connects it with con- sciousness or intelligence is chiefly its regulative power, not the ability to shape higher purposes for men and the world in Plato's sense. It is for this reason that embryonic, Presocratic teleology is not necessarily anti-scientific, as opposed to Platonic developed teleology which to a large extent is. To put the point in another way: such things as the orderliness of the seasons had suggested to the Greeks the operation of some superhuman power. While this was envisaged as a regulative tendency immanent in certain kinds of matter the scientific study of the external world could proceed, though under handicap. But when the idea of purpose was made explicit, and when, because of the development of the idea of immaterial Being, purpose was finally divorced from matter, then new tempta- tions to despise the demands of sense and common-sense made themselves known to the thinkers of the fourth and later centuries before Christ. To summarise: Greek thinkers soon discovered that the preconception of unity in the world called for a reality-principle that lay behind phenomena. Yet even in the mytholo- gising period departures from common-sense, from what could be easily explained in terms of elements of experience, had been avoided to a surprising degree. Similarly in philo- sophical investigations of the underlying unity the evidence of the senses, though subjected to drastic interpretation, was not lightly contradicted. The development of the promising</page><page sequence="13">SENSE AND COMMON-SENSE IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY II7 idea of structural unity was rudely terminated by Parmenides' logical bombshell, which established a neat and indeed seemingly inescapable piece of theoretical analysis at the expense of the entire world of the senses. Subsequent thinkers fought hard to resuscitate the world that we think we live in, and began to examine the nature of sensation as an aid to demonstrating a new type of unperceived unity. Their theories inevitably became very complex here, and they provoked a humanistic reaction which, by intensifying the anthropo- morphising inclination of the Greek mind, led Socrates towards an extreme form of teleo- logy. This, together with the inadequately-investigated assumption of the possibility of stable and unchanging knowledge, led on to the re-establishment of a bizarre though fruitful ontology in the Platonic theory of Forms. Aristotle and the Stoics, however, rejected this kind of abstract improbability, and with certain lapses reconstituted an unseen reality that accorded with and was firmly based on experience. Thus throughout the history of classical Greek thought-with two apparent Presocratic exceptions, one or both of which, as I suggested, may be due to misinterpretation-we find that serious improbabili- ties from the standpoint of common-sense, itself based upon the acceptance of sensation, were only tolerated when they seemed to be entailed by the self-evident: by what was evident to perception, like the world as a whole, or to reason, like the nature of Being, or to intuition, like the fact of knowledge. And always there was a consequent endeavour to overcome the improbability, to move back to a view of reality compatible with what men directly experience. This common-sense resilience is an important part of what is often mentioned but seldom examined, the clarity of Greek thought.' G. S. KIRK.
