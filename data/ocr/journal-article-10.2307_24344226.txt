Reviewed by LeGrace Benson</page><page sequence="2">296 Reviews Since the Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou exhibitions and comprehensive catalogue of 1998-1999, neither Haitian art nor the wider category of Caribbean art has had such a simultaneous international presence in the art space as they had in 2011 and 2012. Three substantial presentations in Europe and the United State attracted large numbers of viewers. Vodou, Un Art de Vivre in Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Canada; Caribbean: Crossroads of the World in New York; and Kafou at Nottingham Contemporary, Nottingham, England each produced catalogue guides of permanent cultural merit. Vodou, un art de vivre featured Madame Marianne Lehmann's collection of Bizango and Vodou art: La Fondation pour la Préservation, la Valorisation et la Production d'Œuvres Culturelles Haïtiens (FPVOCH). The exhibition was at the Musée d'Ethnographie de Genève from December 2007 to August 2008; Amsterdam's Tropenmuseum 2008-2009; the Berlin Ethnologischishes Museum 209-2010; the Bremen Ûbersee Museum in 2011; finally in Musée Canadien des Civilisations in Gatineau, Québec, from November 2012 to February of 2013. The catalogue includes texts by Jacques Hainard, Philippe Mathez, Arnaud Robert, Oliver Schinz, and Gamila Walter; interviews with Marianne Lehmann and Max Beauvoir; an essay on the Vodou-Makaya tradition by Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, and instructive excerpts from the writings of Beauvoir-Dominique, Elizabeth McAlister, and Patrick Polk. It highlights the importance of crossroads, presenting them as the transcendent geography of life and death. Several of the clay sculptures are of theriomorphic creatures existing as species at the crossroads of human and animal, incorporating an imaginaire of the genetic power of both. The Lehmann collection notably includes art generated in secret societies such as Bizango. Secret societies and Vodou should be distinguished from one another; but many Haitians participate in both. They share many beliefs and practices, and have a common source in Haiti's slavery and liberation history. Paralleling bellicose Vodou Petwo rites, forged in anguished resistance to colonial slave economy, arts produced in the secret milieu tend to be aggressive, even brutal, proclaiming a spirit of vigorous combat for self- and community preservation. Swaths of black, red and shades of grey dominate this collection and the catalogue, relieved by light scintillating out of darkness from mirrors and glittering ritual banners. The banners are gorgeous reminders of the fighting military heritage, as Patrick Polk has shown in Haitian Vodou Flags. Superbly photographed by Johnathan Watts, the more than 100 catalogue illustrations evoke a sense that the statues, assemblages, ceramic,</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 297 wooden or metal objects and flags are an army of occupation. Safely on the page, their palpability nevertheless emanates power from their dark but optimistic presence. Overall the anthropomorphic and theriomorphic constructions especially are unsettling chimera. Danger is a resident force in the objects, fully capable of being unleashed if called upon. Not readily visible in the illustrations are table and chair legs fashioned from femurs and tibias. These appear also in Atis Rezistans works included in the Kafou exhibition. Both Kafou in Nottingham and Caribbean: Crossroads of the World in New York City brought together a broad swath of curators and scholars. The resulting catalogues are invaluable repositories of writing by historians, ethnologists, art historians, poets, novelists, curators and collectors. Copious illustrations provide insight and revelation from artists. The Nottingham exhibition ofHaitian art was the largest ever presented in the United Kingdom. The New York exhibition, led by El Museo del Barrio was a tour de force of a decade of El Museo del Barrio, Studio Museum of Harlem and Queens Museum of Art collaborations. The New York event was Caribbean: Crossroads of the World, but the catalogue was Caribbean: Art at the Crossroads of the World, the two titles already indicative of an unresolved choice of routes. "Caribbean" denotes a geography of many islands with common and separate histories, Gordian knotted with the acts and beliefs of multiple peoples and nations. The Crossroads triple event assembled a huge aggregation of writers, scholars and artists addressing numerous issues, some clearly related, others disparate in qualia and implications. For the Nottingham Kafou the non-Haitian co-curators did an exceptional amount of field study and research to arrive at a selection and presentation of exclusively Haitian works of art arising from life ways formed and informed by the Vodou world view. They took Αα/ôw-crossroads-to mean the individual and community position of human beings at the conjunction of earth and sky, the secular mundane and the divine numinous, visible being and invisible existence before birth and after dying: a singularity of space and energy and time. At this crux the Haitian artists addressed existential questions of order and chaos, sickness and health, poverty and plenty, anger and love, fear and comfort, obliteration and salvation. The three-museum event collation with its multiple crossroads is comprehensive and bewildering in just the way the Caribbean islands beyond tourist enclaves are bewildering. A criticism by several Caribbeanists focused on this puzzling arrangement. Some visitors to the exhibition, especially scholars of the region, found the omnium gatherum more perplexing than enlightening</page><page sequence="4">298 Reviews and wished for more direction, explanation, and a clearer thematic or conceptual organization. Of the great variety of other visitors, many of them from the Caribbean, some made similar objections. Others simply enjoyed a succession of delights. Some resonated with heritage identity. Some disputed how that heritage was presented. Perhaps every visitor with personal Caribbean heritage would have wished for more or another selection of works. Mundane constraints on choices in operation at any scale of museum or gallery presentation include such factors as willingness of artists and owners of works to participate, costs of shipping, security concerns and the availability and costs of insurance. Beyond such constraints, exhibitions can be questioned on motivations and choices, bound to be the case with an exhibition of this scope. Yes, there are unfortunate gaps in the Crossroads exhibition, while some artists or moments may have more attention than was of general interest. It was easily possible on a first walk-through to wish for more information, or to see labels that were uninformative, or worse, mis-informative. There are those who wondered aloud why painters like Camille Pissarro or Paul Gauguin, so strongly associated with France, were included. Yet Pissarro was born and received his early rearing on St. Thomas, and Danish Gauguin famously deserted Paris to seek a lost Eden in Martinique. Their inclusion signals the geographical and a cultural crossroads status of the Caribbean. On balance, the breadth and complexity of works and themes presented is meritorious. Caribbean: Art at the Crossroads of the World has similarly mixed reception. It too is an omnium gatherum, with juxtapositions of text and images that on hrst reading and viewing seem arbitrary, the ensemble as bewildering the exhibition. Yet, such disconcert can serve as a felicitous occasion for opening eyes to discover the obscured cryptogram of a region with meaning, order and obedience to laws not yet well understood. The works of art are as diverse as can be imagined, arising from individual sensibilities formed in the temporal, geographic and cultural diversity of the region, everything from Bartholomew Dandridge's 1725 Young Girl with a Dog and a Page; William Blake's 1793 chilling engravings of brutally murdered Surinamese; photographs of Peter Minshall's elaborate self destructing architectonic carnival performances; forged, cut, hammered steel sculptures of Georges Liautaud; Wifredo Lam's surrealism; Ebony Patterson's "Disciplez Series"; and all the photographs from the first years of camera and film to high-tech digital manipulations of the present. The texts range widely, with twenty instructive essays on the works, histories, themes and styles of art, as well as an equal number of excerpts from essays, documents and literary works. The two earliest of these latter, Sir Thomas</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 299 More's 1516 essay on Utopia and "A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies" written by Bartolomeo de las Casas in 1552, mark the desire for good order and the imposition of a unfitting foreign law and order: creation and destruction in the blink of an eye. The Studio Museum focused more on Haiti and its uniquely crucial location, history and distinctive population. Haiti is no less bewildering than any of its neighbors around that sea. Its history and worldviews have their deepest route crossing the Atlantic to return to the African continent. Its ramified secondary root system is a productive tangle of roads leading back and forth to Spain, Italy, France and England, traveled by curious Enlightenment and modern naturalists, adventurers, merchants, escapees from prisons and persecutions, colonists, and a hodge-podge of missionaries and government officials. The earliest paintings in the Harlem Studio Museum section of Crossroads are two by Richard Evans, the artist Abolitionist Thomas Clarkson of London arranged with King Henry to institute an art academy and paint portraits of the king and his family. Some of these are included in the New York exhibition and catalogue and discussed by Haitian art historian, Gérald Alexis. While British teachings vanished when Christophe's Kingdom toppled, African and Creole ways of creating expressive objects continued. So too, much attenuated, did the Taino arts. In the countryside these compound "maroon" sensibilities survived even the several obliteration attempts by church and successive governments, and enjoyed efflorescence in the mid-twentieth century. The paintings of the heroes of the revolution, by artists in the north of Haiti, posited the continuing revolutionary spirit. These latter works, displayed with a bust of Napoleon under their collective feet, occupied a wall in the Studio museum. Close reading of the encyclopedic Crossroads catalogue yields some errors of fact such as impossible birth or production dates (which may be typos). Of course, any and all of the ideas and images presented are open to discussion, but that is part of the cultural enterprise, essential to that uncovering of what the order of things may be. The exhibition is no longer, the shards of this mirror once incompletely put together now broken apart and scattered back into galleries, museums and private collections. The catalogue is reminder of the whole and gnomon of the greater vessel of the once and future Caribbean. Kafou was easier to view and "get a sense of," a certain type of Haitian art and of the religion, Vodou, from which it emerges. Vodou more usually is extravagantly misrepresented, thus unknown. Unknown and</page><page sequence="6">300 Reviews misrepresented, Vodou realizes a degree of redemption from umbrage in the Kafou exhibition and catalogue. The art works present a nuanced instruction. There are works by 35 artists, all but one, or perhaps two, engaged in one way or another with Vodou. The paintings of the artist who programmatically rejected Vodou, Philomé Obin, nevertheless display the unavoidable liens between Vodou and the history he was so at pains to represent. Co-curator Alex Farquharson explains that works by Philomé and his brother Sénèque (who some believe did include references to Vodou) are appropriate to the exhibition partly because of their "mythical and legendary" vision of history and partly because the works show symbolic traces of Vodou. The many Masonic references, ceremonies and symbols that are in the works of both these devoted Freemasons are found as frequently in Vodou ceremonies, representations and symbolism. Far from being a simple parallel, these congruent marks of Vodou and Freemasonry are part of an entwined Long Conversation of liberty, the Rights of Man, and of the polemic and battles to ensure the abolition of slavery. The inclusion of Obin history paintings is thus cogent, bringing to light a key facet of Haitian Vodou: from its beginnings it concerns the struggle for human rights. Other artists were devotees. Painters André Pierre and Robert St. Brice and flagmaker, Clotaire Bazile, were initiates in the highest degree of oungan. Hector Hyppolite had done all study and preparation to become initiated as oungan by the time of his untimely death. At whatsoever degree of Vodou, each of the artists was imbued with the world view, habits of attention, ethical system, history of Vodou and Haitian history, healing mission and beliefs about the nature of the universe and the place of visible human beings, the invisible ancestors, and the invisible divinities. All creation is from one remote god, Bondye and created invisibles - the lwas — directly manifest themselves in a Vodou ceremony. Each of the art works in the exhibition presents a revealing facet, a fact, a nuance, an insight into Vodou. Eyes can see that the religion is a highly developed system of belief and behavior concerning the quotidian on the one hand joining the ineffable on the other. The written Kafou catalogue is not a container of the truth about Vodou, for that is impossible; but it is a thoughtful series of articles by co-curators Farquharson and Leah Gordon, and by scholars of Haitian law, history, religion and art Colin Dayan, Katherine Smith, Wendy Asquith and Michael Richardson. There are no explanatory essays by oungan or manbo although there are many who are both knowledgeable and articulate; contributions from them would have added a valuable practitioner voice to the ensemble. To be fair, the heart of the Nottingham</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 301 effort is the artwork, rather than discussion of it or instruction about the religion. Other scholars contributed short articles about the artists and there are excerpts from earlier writings on Vodou and on Haitian art. [Disclosure: I contributed an excerpt and short explanatory text.] In addition to a helpful timeline of Haitian history there is a chart of major Vodou lwa - the divine spirits who relate directly to Vodouists in daily affairs, life passages, health, love and death as well as manifesting in possession. The chart serves as a guide to some of the iconography of the works, detailing colors, symbols, offerings, ceremonial possession, favored trees and Roman Catholic counterparts. A most welcome feature of the catalogue is the excellent illustrations of all the works. Although this exhibition will not travel to other venues, the catalogue does keep the ensemble together for future enjoyment of a handsome temporary show. There are many works which those interested in Haitian art would not otherwise be able to see, and certainly not in this evocative and enlightening way. This representation of Vodou is the hrst and most comprehensive in Great Britain and was offered in a spirited but not exoticised fashion. Assiduously avoiding sensationalism, the installation took advantage of Nottingham Contemporary's first floor glass wall visible from two major streets. The display of flags and paintings was a colorful invitation to enter. Sequins glittering in the cool northern light enticed an unexpected aperçu into mysteries. This exhibition also drew visitors of all ages and a variety of educational, economic and social situations. The results will never be fully known but surely are a contribution toward understanding the mystery, the danger and the beauty of the human condition.</page></plain_text>
