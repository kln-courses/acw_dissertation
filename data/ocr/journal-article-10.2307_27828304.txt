<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Marvelous Animals: An Introduc tion to the Protozoa by H. Curtis; 189 pages; $5.95; Doubleday &amp; Co., the Natural History Press, for the Ameri can Museum of Natural History, 1968. A free-lance science writer of consider able experience and reputation, Mrs. Curtis has succeeded in producing a delightful and yet at the same time amazingly accurate and up-to-date selective account of representatives of the phylum Protozoa and of their multi farious activities. In a stimulating style, the author presents facts in what seems to me a most palatable way?whether the reader be a layman or a protozoologi cal specialist. The figures are pleasingly numerous and, like the text, generally accurate and appropriately chosen. Perhaps surprisingly, the approach in the book is not an anthropomorphic one, and the vocabulary is thoroughly mod ern. In spite of the restricted length of the volume, such terms as lysosome, syzygy, pinocytosis, vector, missile body, and proter and opisthe are quietly presented and defined without belabor ing them or losing the reader's interest or attention. In such a brief review, it seems almost unfair to point out any specific inac curacies or deficiencies, since they are far out-numbered by praiseworthy features of the book. There are scattered mistakes of fact, but these generally stem from either a source which was inaccurate (and thus Mrs. Curtis can 331A</page><page sequence="2">hardly be held totally accountable) or from the necessity of drastic abbrevia tion (so that information given may be misleading rather than actually wrong). A few of the figures are not up to the quality of the majority; and proper citation of source of some was not given. ?John 0. Corliss</page></plain_text>
