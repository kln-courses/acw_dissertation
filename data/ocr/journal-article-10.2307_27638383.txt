<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 577 Military Practice and Polemic: Israels Laws of Warfare in Near Eastern Perspective, by Michael G. Hasel. Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 2005. Pp. xix + 193. $24.99 (paper). ISBN 1883925479. In this brief volume, the author of Domination and Resistance: Egyptian Military Activity in the Southern Levant 1300-1185 B.C. (Brill, 1998) continues his research in the area of ancient warfare by focusing on the regulations in Deut 20:10-20. In particular Hasel examines the rules related to the destruction of trees in times of war (w. 19-20), arguing that they must be interpreted within a context of the second millennium b.c.e. In the foreword to the book, Kenneth A. Kitchen praises Hasel's work and underscores its importance as a corrective to the "fixation over a supposed (wholly theoretical!) seventh-century date for Deuteronomy" that has "warped [not a few scholars'] attitude to the external sources" (ix). After discussing in the introduction the prejudices of past research on Deuteronomy and laying out the basic historical-critical premises of his own approach, Hasel presents in the first chapter a contextual, syntactical, and linguistic analysis of Deut 20:10-20. In the remaining two chapters he turns his attention to v. 20, which proscribes the destruction of fruit-bearing trees or the use of them in the construction of siegeworks. Assuming that this prohibition must represent a polemic against practices by foreign nations, he examines all the relevant material from ancient western Asia in search of a context in which the prohibition would make sense. The only match he finds is a second millennium source, the annals of Thutmose III, which refers to fruit trees being cut down and employed in siege warfare. Hasel summarizes the findings of his study: "After a comprehensive survey of currently available iconographie, textual, and archaeological evidence, it can only be concluded that such a destruction of fruit trees points to an Egyptian background [for Deut 20:19-20] in the second millennium b.c.e." (128). Hasel has helpfully collected and discussed a wide range of data relating to destruction of trees in western Asian warfare during second and first millennia, and his argument initially seems quite persuasive. Yet before one fixes the date of Deuteronomic legislation to the mid-second millennium b.c.e., there are several things one should consider. To begin with, Hasel's interpretation of Deut 20:19-20 maybe too literal and unduly limit the scope of the prohibitions. The ancient author seems to be presenting Israel with a general ethos for the way Israel should treat the environment of its military opponents. To this end, the author moves within the narrative setting or Textwelt portrayed in ch. 20. Beginning in v. 12, this Textwelt is the situation of a siege. If this siege were to last "many days," Israel should not retaliate by destroying its enemy's life-support systems (v. 19a). The implication is that Israel should never destroy these life-support systems, even when tempted to do so in situations such as a lengthy siege. (The rationale for this prohibition is provided in v. 19b.) The only trees Israel is permitted to cut down are those that "you know do not yield food" (v. 20a). But even those should be cut down, as Ramban points out, only when necessary, such as when materials are needed to build a siegework (v. 20b). By referring to a siegework here, the ancient author is simply working within the Textwelt created in v. 12. This interpretation has direct ramifications for Hasel's study: instead of confining</page><page sequence="2">578 Journal of Biblical Literature 125, no. 3 (2006) the search for parallels solely to sources depicting the use of fruit trees in the construction of siegeworks, one should look for depictions of life-support systems being destroyed, and perhaps specifically in siege activities. In so doing, one finds a vast range of such depictions in both iconographie and textual sources. Significantly, the Neo-Assyrian exemplars are especially numerous. The quantity of Assyrian parallels would seem to support the widely accepted dating of the Deuteronomic legislation to the seventh century b.c.e. However, caution is warranted since it is not at all clear that the text polemicizes against non-native, rather than Israelite, war practices. In a book such as Deuteronomy, when foreign nations are in view the authors tend to say so explicitly. Insofar as the text does not polemicize against foreign military conduct, one would not need to search for descriptions of foreign siegeworks. The most immediate context for understanding Deut 20:19-20 is the Bible itself. In 2 Kgs 3:19 Elisha pronounces a war oracle according to which the Israelite-Judahite Edomite military coalition would destroy the life-support systems of their enemy: "you shall fell every good tree and stop up all the wells of water, and every fertile field you shall hurt (or cause pain: tafcib? btf?b?nim) with stones." If it is not already sufficiently clear that Deut 20:19-20 prohibits this scorched-earth policy required by the oracle (see also the fulfillment in v. 25), then one could compare Elisha's anthropomorphic description of the land in the phrase "to hurt with stones" with the rationale for not destroying trees in Deut 20:19b: "Is the tree of the field a human ... ?" Thus one does not need to assume that the Deuteronomic prohibition relates to foreign, rather than Israelite, war practices. Indeed, it seems quite possible that Deut 20:19-20 is responding, by means of inner biblical exegesis, to 2 Kings 3. Yet Hasel's understanding of Deuteronomy 20 does not permit him to acknowledge these connections. He treats the prohibitions in w. 19-20 as an extension of the legislation on cities within Israelite territory in w. 15-18. In 2 Kings 3 the coalition crosses the borders of this territory, and hence the text would not come into consideration as a context for understanding Deuteronomy 20. This approach to the structure of Deuteronomy 20 poses problems. First, the city in view in w. 19-20 seems to represent any city Israel would attack, not just those within the borders of the land. This conclusion is supported by the similarity in the constructions in v. 10 and v. 19 ("when you approach/besiege a city ... to capture it"). Accordingly, w. 15-18 should probably be read in the final form of the text as a parenthetical paragraph directly related to the specifications in v. 14. After this paragraph, w. 19-20 resume the presentation of general principles for Israel's warfare begun in w. 10-14. The references to "siege" in w. 13b and 19a guide the reader in understanding w. 15-18 as remarks qualifying v. 14. A long line of scholarly tradition, from modern exegetes to ancient Jewish commentators, has understood the chapter s structure in this way. The rabbinic tradition explains the tension between Deut 20:19-20 and 2 Kgs 3:19 by arguing either that Deuteronomy 20 applies only to a situation of siege (see above for the arguments against this approach) or that 2 Kings 3 represents an exception for a unique situation, yet it does not treat the cities in v. 19 as solely those within the land. Second, it is quite likely that Martin Rose, Alexander Rof?, Yair Hoffman, and many</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 579 others are correct in arguing that w. 10-14 and 19-20, which begin with the exact same construction (see above), contain the oldest stratum. Accordingly v. 15?or, more likely, all of w. 15-18?represents a redactional insertion that draws upon the Deuteronomistic concept of h?rem. It corrects the laxer legislation in w. 10-14, 19-20 by confining its applicability to cities outside the borders of the land. Now if 20:15-18 is the product of a redactional reworking of the chapter, then the original formulation of the rules would not have distinguished between cities within and beyond the borders of the land. Only after the insertion of w. 15-18 would it perhaps be possible to locate the city referred to in v. 19 outside the land. Yet, as pointed out above, such an approach would do injustice to the final shape of the text and has the history of interpretation against it. Hasel's discussion of the chapter fails to devote adequate attention to this problem and thus does not recognize 2 Kings 3 as a context for understanding the Deuteronomic legislation. Hasel's book may, therefore, fail to succeed in building a consensus for a mid second-millennium dating of the Deuteronomic legislation. Indeed, the connections to 2 Kings 3 suggest that Deut 20:19-20 is quite late. The study nevertheless helps us reconsider the destruction of life-support systems in ancient warfare. And even when its conclusions cannot be accepted, Hasel must be commended for a well-written and thoroughly researched work. He not only consults many foreign-language publications (an increasing rarity in biblical scholarship), but above all brings together a wide range of relevant archaeological, textual, and iconographie evidence.
