<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theoretical Content of Language Most treaments which I have read of the topic roughly indicateci by my title have contained statements which seemed either false or misleading. So I have thought it worthwhile to point out some of the commoner errors and to provide some guidelines for those who need to find their way through this confusing territory. For the question of theoretical content keeps cropping up, in one way or another, in the most diverse contexts, and needs to, though often it is raised where it is not relevant, or at least not in the way suggested, and is ignored or slighted where it is most relevant. I shall start by running through some samples of the former sort, and thereby show the need of the guidelines which I shall then provide. I. - Theory in language? « I can imagine », writes a contemporary theologian, « that a pigmy language might be such at the present moment that modem science could not very well be translated into it (and from what I hear sociologists and biochemists say, I get the same impression about Italiani). So, too, empiricism, as a language without metaphysical dimensions... may not be an apt language for the Christian proclamation »1. Adopting this terminology, we could apparently say that Hume wrote his Treatise in two languages, English and empiricism, and that when a German biochemist lectures, he speaks both German and biochemistry. There will be atheistic languages, cultured languages, nineteenth-century languages, systematic languages, and many other varieties never heard of before. Clarity is not served by such extension of terms. The doctrines which result sound exciting but are really vacuous. 1 Ρ. Schoonenberg, S.J., Storicità e interpretazione del dogma, in: Schoonenberg (ed.), L'interpretazione del dogma, trans, by E. ten Korte naar (Brescia, 1971), p. 131.</page><page sequence="2">308 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. Thus if we extend the word « language » to cover theories, then of course language will have theoretical content; but that result, which might be interesting in the ordinary accepta tion of the terms, now means merely that theories are theo retical. Verbal moves of this sort are ali too common in philosophical and theological writing; but they are not the principal type of mistake I have in mind. I am more interested in the sort of oversights that might cause someone to talk in this way, bundling languages and philosophies together in the same terminological sack. My examples will be chosen accordingly. Whorf The linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf is known for « what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, which states, at least as a hypothesis, that the structure of a human being's language influences the manner in which he understands reality and behaves with respect to it »2. This too sounds like an exciting claim, but left as here stated it turns out on closer analysis to be a mere tautology, whose truth is assured by the concepì « understanding », as determined by the ordinary use of the word « understand »3. So let us look more closely at the detailed presentation of the thesis, by Whorf himself. In « Science and Linguistics » he makes the following important observations: We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impres sions which has to be organized by our minds — and this 2 J. Β. Carroll (ed.), in : Whorf, Language, Thought, and Reality (Cambridge, Mass., 1964), p. 23. Subsequent references to passages in this volume will be made by means of page numbers in parenthesis, within the text. 3 As they stand, the vague claims of many biblical theologians, to the effect that the structure of a language parallels the thought patterns of those who use it (for instance Greeks or Jews), are similar tautologies. The thinking of those who have learned to speak is, after ali, largely linguistic. For able criticism in this area, see James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language (London, 1961).</page><page sequence="3">THE THEOREnCAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 309 means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way — an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is, of course, an implicit and unstated one, but its terms are absolutely obligatory; we cannot talk at ali except by subscribing to the organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees. (pp. 213-214) So far so good. Whorf retains the kernel of truth in Kant's doctrine of categories and leaves the rest. The categories of human thought are not imposed by the object, but by the subject. They do not result from intuition or conscious choice, but are the furnishings of the human mind from infancy. However, the linguistic practice of the community puts them there, not human nature. As Wittgenstein remarked, « human beings... agree in the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life » (Investigations, § 241). Such, precisely, is Whorf s message. But whereas Wittgenstein merely stressed the legitimacy of diverse categorizations (e. g. Investiga tions, p. 230), Whorf stressed and described, as only a linguist could, the existence of such diversity and the difference it makes in men's pictures of the world. Whether in criticism of Kant's eternai, universal categories, or in discussion of theoretical content in language, this is the more important stress, and a chief point to be made. However, it must be made carefully and correctly, whereas Whorf continues as follows: This fact is very significant for modem science, for it means that no individuai is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality but is constrained to certain modes of interpretation even while he thinks himself most free. The person most nearly free in such respects would be a linguist familiar with very many widely dif ferent linguistic systems. As yet no linguist is in any such position. We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that ali observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are simi lar, or can in some way be calibrated ». (P. 214)</page><page sequence="4">310 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. Here the words « impartiality » and « interpretation » cause misgivings, and make one wonder whether an important error does not perhaps lurk beneath the concluding remark about our « picture of the universe ». It is one thing to picture the universe in different categories and quite another to use cate gories which somehow conflict. Does Whorf mean that one set of categories is like an infra-red filter, producing a picture in which ali the trees look white, whereas a filterless lens makes them appear green; or that one focus leaves fuzzy what another makes sharp; or that one photo shows the front of the house whereas another shows the side or back or top? Pictures differ in innumerable ways, and it is important to know which way or ways Whorf had in mind when he spoke of partiality, modes of interpretation, and differing pictures of the universe. His full illustration of the point, in a table on page 213, is not reassuring. One column indicates how English-speakers would characterize an action, using different tenses to indicate when the action occurred; another column shows how a Hopi Indian might describe the same action, differentiating the « type of validity the Speaker intends the statement to have » (p. 217); and the caption concludes: « What are to English differences of time are to Hopi differences in the kind of validity ». Such an assertion suggests that our misgivings were justified. Whorf's general statement of his thesis left its sense indeterminate, and admitted of acceptable interpretation, but this concrete illustration and its treatment indicate an unacceptable sense. It will not do to say that « what are to English differences of time are to Hopi differences in kind of validity ». One might as well say that if one person calls a pencil hard and another calls it yellow, hardness is yellowness for one and yellow ness hardness for the other. Their focus is different, that is ali. One attende to one aspect, the other to another. Stili, an important truth is hidden in Whorf's sample, one which deserves more accurate statement. If one person calls a pencil hard and another calls it yellow, doubtless that is because the needs and context of the statement called for one focus rather than the other. Now something similar may hold for whole peoples: the context of their lives, their needs and interests, may lead to one set of concepts rather than</page><page sequence="5">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 311 another. And a conceptual system, once established, may in turn powerfully influence the perceptions and way of life of those who employ it. As Wittgenstein said, « Concepts lead us to make investigations; are the expression of our interest, and direct our interest » (Investigations, § 570). However, interest is not accuracy, division is not descrip tion, and a category is not a theory. What we must watch is the idea that one language is truer than another, or that any language or any of its concepts is true 4. Only in a truth-neutral sense can we readily accept Whorf's thesis « that users of markedly different grammars are pointed by their grammars toward different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and hence are not equivalent as observers but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world » (p. 221). In a later article Whorf connected this thesis more ex plicitly with philosophy: The Indo-European languages and many others give prominence to a type of sentence having two parts, each part built around a class of word — substantives and verbs — which those languages treat differently in gram mar. As I showed in the Aprii 1940 Review, this distinc tion is not drawn from nature; it is just a result of the fact that every tongue must have some kind of structure, and those tongues have made a go of exploiting this kind. The Greeks, especially Aristotle, built up this con trast and made it a law of reason. Since then, the contrast has been stated in logie in many different ways: subject and predicate, actor and action, things and relations be tween things, objects and their attributes, quantities and operations. And, pursuant again to grammar, the notion became ingrained that one of these classes of entities can exist in its own right but that the verb class cannot exist without an entity of the other class, the « thing » class, as a peg to hang on. « Embodiment is necessary », the watchword of this ideology, is seldom Strongly ques tioned. Yet the whole trend of modera physics, with its emphasis on « the field », is an implicit questioning of the ideology » (p. 241). * See Wittgekstein's Philosophical Investigations {Oxford, 1967), ρ. 230, and his Philosophische Grammatik (Frankfurt am Main, 1969), p. 111.</page><page sequence="6">312 GAETH HALLETT, S. I. Though one or two things near the end of this passage occasion some misgivings, as a whole it seems to be stating an importànt truth. The structure of the language they spoke has indeed strongly influenced the views of philosophers and others, not only in the innocent sense of determining the aspects of reality they have attended to and their ordering of them, but in the stronger sense that grammar has led to truth or, more frequently, to error. Elsewhere I have developed and stressed Wittgenstein's point that similarities in verbal form constantly beget mistaken notions of how the similar expressions work and therefore of the realities discussed by their means5. So I am in full sympathy with the general drift of Whorf's remarks. And his statement of the point, at least in the passage just quoted, seems preferable to the manner in which many others have stated it. It is often said, for instance, that this or that ideology or theory is « embedded » in ordinary language 6. Authors would be less inclined to speak in this way if they distinguished between a) the ordinary, unexceptionable operation of, say, subject-predicate statements about the latest hurricane or the Olympic Games, which are understood correctly by philosopher and nonphilosopher alike, and b) the subtle influence of lan guage on a philosopher when he starts to theorize about God, man, and the universe. To conclude from b) that an ideology is « embedded » in the language would be comparable to claiming that the sicknesses people sometimes contract from swimming in the ocean are « embedded » in the ocean, or that the suicides of ruined speculators are « enshrined » in the stock exchange. Such talk is not enlightening. Whorf exemplifìes clearly the type of error I have in mind when he says, a page later: « The English technique of talking depends on the contrast of two artificial classes, substantives and verbs, and on the bipartitioned ideology of nature, already discussed ». The second pari of this statement is simply false. Whorf himself spoke perfectly good English but rejected the substance-accident ideology. As for the Greeks, mentioned in the earlier quotation, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and others like 5 See my The Botile and the Fly, in: Thought, 46 (1971), pp. 83-104. β See e. g. F. Waismann, AnalyticSynthetic, V, in: Analysis, 13 (1952 53), pp. lff; and references at the end of the third section of this article.</page><page sequence="7">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 313 wise rejected the « bipartitioned ideology of nature », yet spoke perfectly good Greek. Their use of the subject-predicate form neither implied nor required acceptance of an Aristotelian ideology, or any other. Russell Corning to a philosopher now, we find Bertrand Russell making similar remarks: « The conception of substantial iden tity with varying properties is embedded in language, in com mon sense, and in metaphysics » 7. This is very much as though one were to say: « One fìnds Newton's law of gravitation embedded in the fall of an appiè, a boy's description of it, and Newton's Principia ». « Embedded » means something dif ferent each time, and a modem physicist might object to the claim that Newton's imperfect generalization is embedded in nature. Newton, not nature, is to blame for the imperfec tions of Newton's theory. What was nature to do — slow down high-speed events so that Newton could observe them and become aware of relativity? Likewise, what is language to do — acquaint each Indo-European speaker with Hopi and Chinese so as to make him aware of linguistic relativity and so forestali the philosophical errors Russell and Whorf refer to? No, lan guage is not at fault. Philosophers are. Yet Russell repeatedly put the blame on ordinary language, so sought to revise it. Here is another typical form misunderstandings take concerning language and its content. I shall offer just one illustration from among the many in Russell's writings. « The supposition of common sense and naive realism », he says, « that we see the actual physical object, is very hard to reconcile with the scientific view that our perception occurs somewhat later than the emission of light by the object... »8. « Science holds that, when we ' see the sun ', there is a process, starting from the sun, traversing the space between the sun and the eye, changing its character when it reaches the eye, changing its character again in the optic nerve and the brain, and finally producing the event ? The Analysis of Matter (London, 1954), p. 152. 8 Ibid., p. 155.</page><page sequence="8">314 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. which we cali ' seeing the sun ' » 9. Since this ultimate event, the actual seeing, does not contain the sun, we never see the sun — nor a table, nor a traffic accident, nor any of the things we say we see. Our whole use of this verb is wrong. And the same holds for other verbs of sensation. « To say we see the nerves is like saying we hear the nightingale; both are convenient but inaccurate expressions. We hear a sound which we believe to be causally connected with the nightingale, and we see a sight which we believe to be causally connected with a nerve »10. Thus Russell was not criticizing just this or that statement, but our whole way of speaking about seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling, and so on. And his reason was the conviction that these everyday forms of speech express mistaken theories of perception, now shown to be untenable by the advance of science. « ' Naive language ' », replied Wittgenstein, « that is to say our naive, normal way of expressing ourselves, does not contain any theory of seeing — does not show you a theory but only a concept of seeing » u. For Russell is right when he supposes scientific theory to be absent from the average speaker's use of a term like « see »; and the « naive theory » to which he refers, if really a theory, is just as rare. For what does it mean to say that « When we ' see ' an object, we seem to have im mediate knowledge of something external to our own body »?12 What sense is Russell here giving to the expression « im mediate knowledge »? What would it be like to have immediate knowledge of the sun, such as Russell denies? Would the sun be related to us in the same way a sensation is? Then it would not be the sun. The hypothesis does not make sense. Or should it not be in us, but we in it, with our brains at least miraculously preserved from going up in a puff of vapor? No, this too is nonsense. And how can we seem to be doing something unintelligible? What sense does it make to attribute an unintelligible thesis to the general public? They do not go about stating any such theory. Nor do they act on it. Not only do philosophers who have stated and defended a theory of » Ibid., ρ. 197. 10 The Atialysis of Mind (London, 1921), p. 299. 11 Zettel, ed. by G. E. M. Anscombe and G.

Anscombe (Oxford, 1967), §223. ι2 Russell, Analysis of Matter, p. 133.</page><page sequence="9">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 315 immediate realism constitute a minute minority of those who use sensation expressions like « see », but their complex formula tions can hardly be considered a mere explicitation of what most people believe and of what they intend or communicate when they speak of seeing the sun, a movie, or a friend in the Street. The pity is that confusion like Russell's has tended to dis credit not only the sort of mediate realism he championed, but the whole debate about realism, and metaphysics in general. Philosophers acute enough to note the confusion often suppose that it produces the issues as well as the manner of their treatment, and so abandon the issues along with the attempted solutions. This is one strong indication of the need to clarify the question of theoretical content. Had Russell and many others been clearer on this subject, they would never have said the things they did about sensation, sense-data, and many another topic. For to clear up the question of theoretical content is to throw much light on the informative operation of language, with ali that entails for philosophy as a whole and for ali other disciplines where the operation of words is chiefly informative. II. - Language from theory? « In such a difficulty », writes Wittgenstein at one point in the Investigations, « always ask yourself: How did we learn the meaning of this word (' good ' for instance)? From what sort of examples? in what language-games? » (§ 77). « Although this language is not what you talk when you are twenty, you get a rough approximation to what kind of language game is going to be played »13. Thus there is a connection between his general estimate that « a language-game does not have its origin in consideration »14 and the view already cited, that the agreement which underlies communication by means of lan guage « is not agreement in opinions but in form of life ». Numerous authors have taken a different view of the origin 13 L. Wittgenstein, Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psycholo gy attd Religious Belief, ed. by C. Baekett (Oxford, 1966), pp. 1-2. i* Zettel, § 391.</page><page sequence="10">316 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. of language, whether for the individuai or for the race, and have stressed theoretical content accordingly. Whereas Whorf and Russell, in the passages cited, stressed the influence of language on thought, the representative thinkers now to be considered have stressed the reverse influence, of thought on language. James At the start of the chapter of Pragmatism15 entitled « Prag matism and Common Sense », William James enuntiates the thesis « that our fundamental ways of thinking about things are discoveries of exceedingly remote ancestors, which have been able to preserve themselves throughout the experience of ali subsequent time. They form one great stage of equilibrium in the human mind's development, the stage of common sense » (p. 114). « Common sense », he explains, here means the « use of certain intellectual forms or categories of thought » (ibid.), « of which the most important are these: thing; the same or different; kinds; minds; bodies; one time; one space; subjects and attributes; causai influences; the fancied; the real » (pp. 115-116). « What a straightening of the tangle of our expe rience's immediate flux and sensible variety does this list of terms suggest! » (p. 118). But is it a list of terms, or a list of categories, or are terms and categories identical for James? He calls the cate gories concepts (p. 115), which suggests that they are word meanings, and Denkmittel (p. 119), which suggests a similar interpretation (for words are the enduring items repeatedly used in acts of stating, theorizing, questioning, discussing, prov ing, etc.). Thus it would seem that the inventors made up new uses for words, or words with new uses. However, James also speaks of the categories' being « built into the very struc ture of language » (p. 126), which could hardly be said of word meanings, but might possibly be said of theories; and in fact he surmises that they are « a collection of extraordinarily suc cessimi hypotheses (historically discovered or invented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by everybody) » 15 New York, 1963. Subsequent page references in the text are to this volume.</page><page sequence="11">THE THEOREnCAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 317 (ibid.) But in what sense can the category « thing » or the category « same » be called a hypothesis? Is it a theory that there are three things on the table, or that they are the same kind of thing, namely knives? What are these « categories »? I can find no coherent interpretation of James's thesis. How does such confusion come about? An important factor, no doubt16, is the great diversity of employment which lurks, unnoticed, beneath the surface uniformity in sound and appearance of individuai key terms such as « category » and « concepì ». The diversity is especially pronounced in philo sophical and theological literature. Thus in his critique of Kittel, James Barr lists these four uses of the term « concepì »: 1) « for the linguistic entity usually called a word »; 2) « for one general notion which may be partially or approximately represented by each of several words »; 3) « in phrases like ' the Johannine concepì of the Logos ' or ' the concept of justi fication by faith ' », where « the ' concept ' is roughly a phrase or term which can be taken as a brief formulation of the main content of a passage »; 4) in expressions such as « the anthropomorphic concept of God », where « the ' concept ' is no longer something that could also be called a ' word ' or a ' key phrase ', but is a tendency of thought easily recognizable, but one which can hardly be identifìed with any one specifìc linguistic expression at ali »17. Similar fluctuations occur in the employment of the word « language ». When, for instance, non-linguistic philosophers suppose, a priori and not merely post factum, that linguistic philosophy must be shallow or narrow, since it attends so much to language, one can frequently detect a shallow or nar row concept of language at work; « language », for the moment, has become a name for mere patterns of sound and marks on paper, or at most for words plus syntax. Neither theories nor referents nor varied forms of life enter in. Then there is the ordinary use of the term « language », for English, Greek, Tamil, and the like; that is, for complex patterns in the total weave of our lives. In addition, some people talk of « the language of the Bible », and do not mean Greek or Hebrew, ιβ I pass over James's pragmatismi, as less widely relevant and less amenable to brief treatment, ir Op. cit., p. 210.</page><page sequence="12">318 GARTH HALLETT, S. X. or speak of « religious language », and do noi mean the lan guage spoken but the things said in it. Finally, the word is sometimes extended stili farther, in a way analogous to the fourth use of « concept » on Barr's list: as Kittel spoke of « the anthropomorphic concept of God », so Schoonenberg, in the passage already quoted, spoke of empiricism as « a lan guage without metaphysical dimensions ». Robinson Such ambiguities do not seem to account for J. A. Robin son's analogous suggestion when he writes: « if we ask why it was that the Jews... made do with one word (basar) where the Greeks required two (σάρξ and σώμα), we come up against some of the most fundamental assumptions of Hebraic thinking about man. Our contention will be that the Pauline use of σάρξ and σώμα is to be understood only in the light of these assumptions, and, consequently, that the Greek presuppositions, which necessarily demanded two words instead of one, are simply misleading if made the starting point in interpreting Paul's meaning »1S. The hypothesis, this time, clearly regards the origin of words. Thus, discussing the distinction between man and man, Robinson further remarks: « The Hebrews, òy the very fact that they did not require two words at this point, showed that they did not regard chis distinction as funda mental » (p. 15). A language, it would seem, is a direct reflection of the philosophy of the people who use it. Barr summarizes Robin son's views thus: « (a) Where one language has one word for an object and another language has two, the writer assumes that the only possible explanation is the asking of questione or making of distinctions by the speakers of the latter, a kind of simple philosophy in fact. (b) Where such questions or distinctions are formed, he assumes that they will necessarily demand {and apparently receive) the availability of two words to represent the distinction accurately and conveniently »18. Barr rightly considers these assumptions untenable, for reasons le The Body. A Study in Patitine Theology (London, 1952), p. 12. Subsequent page references in the text are to this book. ι» Op. cit., p. 35.</page><page sequence="13">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 319 I shall not repeat, since his critique is so thorough. Yet there is an element of truth in Robinsons's assumptions: as we have seen, it is to be expected that people's interests and beliefs will frequently affect their vocabulary; a distinction considered im portant and therefore often discussed may well evoke a new term designed to make the distinction more handily. However, the difference thus expressed is frequently a non-theoretical one, recognized by Jew and Greek alike. And there is no guarantee a new term will be coined for the purpose. Life and death are important, so we have « corpse » in addition to « living man » and « dead man »; but wealth, too, is sup posedly important in America, yet Americans have introduced no single term for « rich man » or « poor man ». And even if they did, it would then be used by both money-seekers and money-scorners. And were a shift to occur in the country's priorities and were wealth itself devalued, the term would probably continue in use. There is no tight connection between a people's word-stock and their values or ideology. Chihara and Fodor The genetic thesis of James is confused. Robinson's is clearer, but clearly wrong. For a detailed proposai in a similar vein, argued with sophistication by two students of language, let us turn to C. P. Chihara and J. A. Fodor's article, « Opera tionalism and Ordinary Language: A Critique of Wittgen stein » 20. Whereas Robinson saw simple theories at the origin of concepts, Chihara and Fodor see them at the origin of each individual's mastery of existing concepts; and whereas for James some of our ancestors were perhaps linguistic or con ceptual geniuses, for Chihara and Fodor there may be a touch of genius in each child who learns the English language. They arrive at this surmise via criticism of a thesis which they attribute (mistakenly) to Wittgenstein, namely: « if we are justified in claiming that one can teli, recognize, see, or determine that ' Y ' applies on the basis of the presence of X, then either X is a criterion of Y or observations have shown that X is correlated with Y » (p. 291). As a counter-instance to this thesis they cite the detection of high-speed, charged 20 In American Philosophical Quarterly, 2 (1962), 281-295.</page><page sequence="14">320 GARTH HALLETT, S. X. particles in the Wilson cloud-chamber. « According to present scientifìc theories, the formation of tiny, thin bands of fog on the glass surface of the instrument indicates the passage of charged particles through the chamber. It is obvious that the formation of these streaks is not a Wittgensteinian criterion of the presence and motion of these particles in the apparatus. That one can detect these charged particles and determine their paths by means of such devices is surely not, by any stretch of the imagination, a conceptual truth » (ibid.). « It is equally clear that the basis for taking these streaks as indicators of the paths of the particles is not observed correlations be tween streaks and some criterion of motion of charged par ticles » (ibid.). From this refutation, establishing a third possibility, they conclude: alternatives to Wittgenstein's analyses of ordinary lan guage mental terms should at least be explored. Per haps, what we ali learn in learning what such terms as « pain » and « dream » mean are not criterial connections which map these terms severally onto characteristic pat terns of behavior. We may instead form complex con ceptual connections which interrelate a wide variety of mental states. It is to such a conceptual system that we appeal when we attempt to explain someone's be havior by reference to his motives, intentions, beliefs, desires, or sensations (p. 293). Both early and late in his career, Wittgenstein would readi ly have recognized that we « form complex conceptual connec tions which interrelate a wide variety of mental states ». « Everyday language », he wrote, « is a part of the human or ganism and is no less complicated than it »21. But the very complexity of the linguistic activity with which we credit even young children should put us on our guard. In the same number of the Tractatus Wittgenstein also wrote: «Man pos sesses the ability to construct languages capable of expressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has mean ing or what its meaning is — just as people speak without knowing how the individuai sounds are produced ». Thus we si Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, trans, by D. Pears and B. McGuin ness {London, 1961), 4.002.</page><page sequence="15">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 321 must distinguish between learning how to use words and learn ing how they are used. Linguists and linguistic philosophers are made, not born. « We talk, we utter words, and only later get a picture of their lives » (Investigations, p. 209). The phrase « what we ali learn in learning what such terms as ' pain ' and ' dream ' mean » calls for further distinctions. Here learning could mean the initial step which permits a child to use and understand the word, or it could refer to the long-term process by which we grow into our patrimony as western, twentieth-century adults. Similarly, the meaning acquired could be either that minimal « use in the language » or the scientific concept resulting from recent investigations, that is, the meaning the word has for a trained psychologist. Our authors blur these distinctions, thereby giving the impres sion that language is highly theoretical right from the start. « A child who never dreamed », they suggest, « but who was very clever, might arrive at an understanding of what dreams are just on the basis of the sort of theoretical inference we have described above » (p. 293). But would he learn anything about EEG? Yet isn't that now considered part of « what dreams are », much as light and sound are now considered wave motions? « What dreams are » is another ambiguous phrase. There are two chief kinds of what-question: factual and conceptual. The question « What is water? » may mean « What is the constitution (e.g. the chemical analysis) of the stuff called water? » or it may mean « What is called water? How is the word used? » The former question presupposes the answer to the latter; that is, theory presupposes concept. The concept it presupposes is not another theory, but a custom or convention. Thus the child who acquires this concept does not acquire a theory, but masters a form of life. And it does not acquire this mastery through speculation; at the stage where it is learning basic words like « pain », « dream », and « water », a child does not ask itself: « I wonder what that sound refers to — whether it means this, or is perhaps a name for that ». Even were it speculatively inclined, it does not know these semantic terms. Nor is it equipped by nature with others, prior to learning English, French, German, or the like. Nor does it possess these concepts; what does it know</page><page sequence="16">322 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. about names, or meaning, or referring, before it has learned the language-game of naming and referring? There is a ten dency to read back into our infancy forms of thinking and learning which cannot possibly explain our entry into language, since they are linguistic, both in mode and in content22. « But mustn't the child go through at least an implicit argu ment by analogy to arrive at the notion that other people have experiences like his own, for instance pain, which explain their use of mental predicates? » No, for an « implicit » argument is not an argument but a belief for which some philosopher might provide an argument. And the only reason we might want to cali this naturai belief a « theory », and so attribute « theoretical » content to these concepts, is that the belief has on occasion been set forth theoretically by philoso phers; we do not generally speak of the « theory » that other people exist or of the « theory » that they have pains. There is justifìcation enough for speaking of theoretical content in language; we need not exaggerate the amount. III. - Guidelines In reaction to various errors which typically exaggerate theoretical content, I have been stressing the basic neutrality of language. This is the first step in setting matters straight. However, in an important sense, seldom noted, language is also full of theory. Hence completeness calls for a second, antithetical step, in which theoretical content is stressed. In the present section I shall first develop the thesis of neutrality in a more positive, systematic manner than previously; then argue the counter-thesis of theoretical content; and finally sug gest a synthetic view demonstrating the compatibility of thesis 22 « We regard the case, » wrote Wittgenstein, « as though the child already possessed a language in which it thought and that the teacher's job is to induce it to guess his meaning in the realm of meanings before the child's mind, as though the child could in his own private language ask himself such a question as, ' Does he want me to continue, or repeat what he said, or something else? ' » (Blue and Brown Books, Oxford, 1960, p. 105). « Thus the matter is represented as though the child never learned language, so never learned to think, but only to translate a lan guage it already knows into another» {Etne philosophische Betrachtung, in: Schriften, 5, Frankfurt am Main, 1970, p. 152).</page><page sequence="17">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 323 and antithesis. The overall result will be a rough but I hope helpful sketch not only of theoretical content but of cognitive discourse in general. The Neutrality of Language Allegations of theoretical content frequently indicate that their authors have overlooked the basic distinction between language and its use, that is, between a system of rules and concepts such as the English or French language and the end lessly varied statements made by people in that language. This oversight is both conceptual and factual. It shows neglect of the way we ordinarily use the word « language », and of this basic fact about language: any theory which can be meaning fully asserted in a given language can be meaningfully denied in the same language. In this important sense language is scientifically, philosophically, and theologically neutral. It is uncommitted. Wittgenstein's well-known dictum might seem to cast doubt on this thesis. « If language is to be a means of communica tion », he said, « there must be agreement not only in defini tions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgments » (In vestigations, § 242). The point may be grasped, at least in part, if we reflect that the meaning of most words is deter mined not by definitions (few adequate ones have been given even post factum) but by the words' use in the language, that is by their occurrence in statements, that is in judgments. The word « red », for instance, has the meaning it does be cause people have called this, that, and the other thing red. Thus if one English-speaking person in conversation with an other English-speaking person pointed to an obviously scarlet object and said « This thing is not red », the other would not understand him. He wouldn't know what language-game was being played. This negation would not be meaningful. How ever, I did not say that any proposition which can be meaning fully asserted in a given language can be meaningfully denied in the same language. I spoke of theories, and the redness or non-redness of a clearly-seen object is no theory. What would it mean to say that a person believes that the color he is looking at (brighi scarlet, say) is red? Wouldn't it mean at most that he believes the word « red » is used for this shade?</page><page sequence="18">324 GAKTH HALLETT, S. X. But let us vary the example. Suppose that someone were to deny that the Earth had existed for the last five minutes. Would that denial be intelligible? And aren't there many such planks in the floor of language? « I have a world picture », wrote Wittgenstein. « Is it true or false? Above ali it is the substratum of ali my enquiring and assenting »23. But once again, this admission does not invalidate the thesis of neutrality. For not only is belief in the existence of the Earth for the last five minutes no theory (save in some Pickwickian sense of « theory ») but it is doubtful whether in actual verbal inter course the affirmative statement would be any more intelligible than the negative. « With this is connected the fact that, for instance, the proposition ' The Earth has existed for millions of years ' makes clearer sense than ' The Earth has existed in the last five minutes '. For I should ask anyone who asserted the latter: 'What observations does this proposition refer to; and what observations would count against it? ' — whereas I know what ideas and observations the former proposition goes with» (Investigations, p. 221). It is somewhat as though a quarterback were to announce in a huddle, « On this play we will ali stay on the field », or a chess coach were to advise a player, « Against this man it will be best to move just your own pieces ». We might begin to wonder what game was being played. And so it is with the verbal move, « The Earth has existed in the last five minutes », or, « The Earth has not existed in the last five minutes ». So my thesis stands. Notice, moreover, that unquestioned truths such as the existence of the Earth during the last five minutes, which together form the world-picture to which Witt genstein referred, are communicated neither explicitly, by sen tences like « The Earth has existed in the last five minutes » (for nobody makes such statements), nor implicitly, by sen tences such as « The Earth has existed for millions of years » (for no one can be taught what he already knows, and everyone knows, for instance, that the Earth has existed for the last five minutes). So it would be misleading to say that such truths belong to the content of language, or to the meaning of our terms, or anything of that sort. One might as well 23 Ori Certainty, ed. by G. E. M. Anscomhe and G. H. von Wrigiit, trans, by D. Paul and G. E. M. Anscombb (Oxford, 1969), § 162.</page><page sequence="19">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 325 say that whenever one person speaks to another he tells him implicitly, « I exist and have a voice ». Once again, language is neutral. In some respects, it is true, language is noi neutral. Its concepts, as Wittgenstein pointed out, reflect and direct our interests. But interests are not theories. Also, as Whorf stressed, concepts cut up reality one way rather than another. But neither are borderlines theories. The eskimo who has dozens of terms for snow, or the Egyptian fellah whose carnei terminology is equally rich, employs a finer conceptual mesh than we to express observations which are often more refìned, but does not necessarily hold conflicting or even different be liefs about snow or camels. Such differences from people to people and from language to language are paralleled within a single language, where one person, whose color vocabulary is limited, may look at a thing and cali it blue, whereas another person, whose training, interests or occupation have enriched his terminology, may look at the same object, see the same shade, and cali it cobalt. Even when theory, and not just interest or utility, begets a concepì, the concepì retains its neutrality. Thus Kant gave his own sense to terms like « Ding-an-sich », Teilhard coined words like « Christogenesis » to express his viewpoint, and others now use the terms in the sense these thinkers gave them; but they need not share their views. They are free to deny that there is any such thing as Christogenesis or a Ding-an-sich, using those very words. In fact the chances are that the best term to use in denying a theory is the term made up to assert it. It hits the nail squarely on the head. This is as true of terms in general currency as of one thinker's jargon. Religious beliefs, philosophical theses, and scientific theories give rise to common concepts or sets of concepts which are then employed by some to impugn the doctrine. The word « Trinity », for instance, acquired its meaning from those who believed in the Trinity, but has been used as well by those who denied it. Terms such as « soul », « resurrection », « reincarna tion », « ether », « subconscious » and « God » teach the same lesson. Philosophers and others should beware of assuming that beliefs which shape a language linger on in it, committing ali speakers to express the beliefs which begot the terms they use.</page><page sequence="20">326 GARTH HALLETT, S. X. Let us briefly sharpen the focus and note the nuances some cases may require. The word « jesuitical » was popularized by enemies of the Jesuits, who considered them a crafty, underhanded lot, and has come down to our day with that meaning. Now, though, a person may use the term without any knowledge of its history and without even knowing who the Jesuits are. His use of the word does not commit him to any view of history, or enlist him on either side of the ancient hassle. This much, however, is true, that repeated use of « jesuitical » would tend to poison people's minds against Jesuits. And friends of the order, conscious of the term's origin and its probable effect, are less prone to employ it than neutral or hostile speakers. Jesuits themselves are likely to use it only jokingly. Much the same can be said of a concept's effect on theory as of its origin in theory. As I have already observed, we are powerfully affected in our thinking by what Wittgenstein called surface grammar. Sameness of word suggests sameness of object. Similarity of expression suggests similarity in depth grammar. Imposing theories and systems are generated by a mere form of predication. But, once again, these effects do not belong to the content of the expressions. For the views sug gested by their mother tongue to some philosophers are denied by others who speak the same language. And the majority of the population hold none of the opposing views. For instance, they side neither with the nominalist nor with the realist nor with the Wittgensteinian concerning essences and corresponding concepts. They have given the matter little or no thought. Trae, if asked whether the same thing is said of a painting as of a sunset when it too is called beautiful, they would doubtless reply « yes ». But this does not demonstrate wide spread belief in an essence of beauty. For they would give the same reply if asked whether the same property is predicated of a crimson thing as of a scarlet thing when they are both called red. Verbal identity — « beauty » in both cases, or « red » in both cases — suffices to trigger the response. « Same », too, is a neutral expression. The influence of surface grammar may, after ali, work in opposite directions. One analogy tugs one way, another way. Thus the resemblance between the substantive another « time » and names for objects suggests perhaps that this word, too,</page><page sequence="21">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 327 has a referent, albeit an ethereal one; and the similarity between talk of measuring time and talk of measuring objects may suggest that the referent is spread out, as objects are, but in another dimension. However, this same analogy, of measuring objects, led Augustine to the conclusion that time is not spread out, as tables and oceans are, but is concentrated within the mind. So which of these views are we to cali the content of the word « time » or of the expression « measure time »? Both? No, neither. Once again, language is neutral. Theoretical Content I move now from thesis to antithesis: in an equally basic sense, language is full of theoretical content. In fact, it is difficult to see how any widely held theory would fail to affect the content of some word or other. Such is the conclusion we reach if we consider the cognitive functioning of words. Frequently, when language is called a system of commu nication, this is taken to mean communication of thoughts, as if the chief function of words were to make the hearer or reader think the same thoughts as the speaker or writer. I shall not point out ali the inadequacies of such an account, but shall only remark that even statements (as opposed to questions, commands, requests, ejaculations, and so on) exchanged in idle conversation (and not in examinations, giving instructions, etc.) have a far broader function than the stimulation of thoughts. For they convey knowledge. And knowledge is not thought (the verb « think » is used for an activity, the word « know » is not). And the knowledge communicated by a statement (if any at ali is actually communicated) always extends beyond what the recipient thinks. Consider, for example, a simple statement such as « My house is white ». The hearer learns from it that the speaker's house is neither pink nor green nor blue nor purple nor orange nor red nor brown nor black, etc.24 He did not know this before, but now he definitely does. But naturally he does not 24 Someone whose common sense had been affected by too much linguistic analysis might object that a white house may have trimmings of another color; bui of course the person who says his house is white is not talking about the trimmings, and neither am I when I state the corresponding negations.</page><page sequence="22">328 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. run through ali these other colors in his mind when he hears the single predicate, « is white ». He does not think ali these negations — nor ali the other, far richer cognitive content which, for the sake of simplicity, I have not even mentioned. With these preliminary points clarifìed, we can proceed to the question of theoretical content, by means of the follow ing sample. Suppose that one person said to another, « There is water on the floor ». An ordinary hearer, who knew the properties of water but not the condition of the floor, would then know that there is a substance on the floor which will boil and evaporate if heated enough and freeze if sufficiently cooled, and whose chemical analysis is H20. Such, unquestion ably, is the informative content of the statement, for such a hearer. For his general knowledge of water gave him no know ledge that the substance was on the floor; the statement did that. Consequently, he can now teli you, if asked, the chemical composition of the stuff on the floor, how it would react to heat, how to cold, and so on. And entering the room, he would be cautious, so as not to slip. By the ordinary criteria of knowledge, he knows the properties of the stuff on the floor. However, once again, these items did not ali pass through his mind. He did not think of them ali. Now the item of information, « There is H20 on the floor », might reasonably be called the « theoretical content » of this statement. It belongs to the content, because the statement characteristically conveys it. It is theoretical, because it results from scientific inquiry and presupposes some knowledge of chemical theory, to be understood. The content « There is H20 on the floor » is not, however, a theory; for it is not general. So the statement does not have theoretical content in the sense that « Water is H20 » does. It does not convey any theory. Recognition of such implicit theoretical content in a state ment about water does not yet entitle us to attribute theoretical content to language; for a language is a system of concepts, not of statements. Nevertheless, the chemical analysis is found in the content of any statement about water. Hearing that water is present on Mars, we know that H20 is present on Mars. Told that little water falls in western Perù, we know that little H20 falls in western Perù. And so on. Such is the power of the word « water ». It does not convey the general theory, but its effect is theoretical, in virtue of the well-known</page><page sequence="23">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 329 theory. In this sense the chemical analysis of water does belong to the concept « water ». I can imagine someone objecting as follows: « This theo retical knowledge about the substance on the floor results from the hearer's special knowledge; on someone else the statement might produce no such effect. Hence we should not include this item in the very meaning of the word, as your talk about the concept ' water and its content, seems to do ». True, some hearers might not know the chemical analysis, but then some might not know that water freezes, or that it boils (I am thinking of young children, or natives in the tropics). And even the color and taste are variables, since no one could be sure of either, on the strength of the mere words « There is water on the floor ». The context might indicate scrub water or rain water, with corresponding variations in taste and color. And it might indicate it for one hearer and not for another, depending, for instance, on whether the person knew it had been raining or that someone had been scrubing the floor. Hence if we eliminated ali elements dependent on the hearer's antecedent knowledge, no content whatsoever would remain. The elements we tend to list in a definition or in a word's « meaning » are common ones, commonly known. So long as only a few people know or believe that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, the analysis is likely to remain in books of chemistry and to be labeled a « theory » or « hypo thesis ». When more widely known and accepted, it is likely to creep into dictionaries, under the entry « water », and to be mentioned in answer to the question « what is water? » But no magic line separates defining properties from non-defin ing. Concepts grow by degrees, both for the individuai and for the populace as a whole. Often the individuai passes through stages corresponding to those for the people or race, ontogeny mirroring phylogeny. Before learning the word « water » a child usually becomes acquainted with the sensible properties of water — its feel, taste, appearance, fluidity. Its behavior in extreme cold or extreme heat he may learn later than the word. Its chemical analysis and especially the meaning of the analysis he is likely to learn stili later, if at ali. And a statement containing the word « water », uttered at these different moments of his progress, will teli him correspondingly more or less.</page><page sequence="24">330 GARTH HALLETT, S. X. This is true whether the statement be general or particular. For just as general belief (e.g. « Water is H20 ») plus particular statement (e.g. « There is water on the floor ») results in par ticular content (e.g. « There is H20 on the floor »), so general belief (e.g. « Water is H20 ») plus general statement (e.g. « Water is heavier than kerosene ») results in a new general belief (« H20 is heavier than kerosene »). This content can be called theoretical without restriction, for it is general. But it must not be confuseci with the theory which generateci it. The statement does not inform anyone about the chemical analysis of water. That theory does not belong to the content. The word « water » is typical. Countless other terms ac quire content in the same graduai way, incorporating new theories and discoveries connected with the originai nucleus. Think of words such as « light », « moon », « car », « red », « tree », « man », « heart », « dollar ». What new theory is un connected with some word or fails, therefore, when generally accepted, to enrich the content of language? Synthesis I have asserted that language is basically neutral, since any theory which can be meaningfully asserted in a language can also be denied in it (if the language provides for denial); and on the other hand I have insisted that language is basically non-neutral, since a pragmatic examination reveals the com municative power of countless concepts to be theoretical. Now Wittgenstein provides an example and an analysis which reveal perspicuously the compatibility and copresence of these two aspects of language: If one says « Moses did not exist », this may mean various things. It may mean: the Israelites did not have a single leader when they withdrew from Egypt — or: their leader was not called Moses — or: there cannot have been any one who accomplished ali that the Bible relates of Moses — or: etc. etc. — We may say, following Russell: the name « Moses » can be defined by means of various de scriptions. For example, as « the man who led the Is raelites through the wilderness », « the man who lived at that time and place and was then called ' Moses ' », « the man who as a child was taken out of the Nile by</page><page sequence="25">THE THEOEETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 331 Pharaoh's daughter » and so on. And according as we assume one defìnition or another the proposition « Moses did not exist » acquires a different sense, and so does every other proposition about Moses. — And if we are told « Ν did not exist », we do ask: « What do you mean? Do you want to say... or... etc.? » But when I make a statement about Moses, — am I always ready to substitute some one of these descriptions for « Moses »? I shall perhaps say: By « Moses » I un derstand the man who did what the Bible relates of Moses, or at any rate a good deal of it. But how much? Have I decided how much must be proved false for me to give up my proposition as false? Has the name « Moses » got a fìxed and unequivocal use for me in ali possible cases? — Is it not the case that I have, so to speak, a whole series of props in readiness, and am ready to lean on one if another should be taken from under me and vice versa? (Investigations, § 79). These and subsequent remarks in the same number indicate why we may reasonably maintain that the name « Moses » is both neutral and packed with theory. In keeping with the thesis of basic neutrality, we see that a person may deny any one of these beliefs about Moses and stili be understood. It is not as though he were to speak of a triangle and argue that it had no sides; for many other, independent beliefs are left standing. As Wittgenstein used to say (e.g. Investigations, § 79), the term is like a table, which stands on many legs, not one, so may wobble if one is removed, but does not fall. As for the cognitive content, we see too that no one of these items is communicated to ali hearers or can be identified, therefore, as the content of the name. For these reasons, and in the sense they indicate, we can cali the name neutral. On the other hand, it is also highly theoretical, in this sense, that on each occasion the content consists of such theoretical items, now this set now that. The knowledge and beliefs resulting from statements about Moses depend on the antecedent know ledge and beliefs of the hearers — their religious convictions, acquaintance with the biblical account, theories of hermeneu tics, basic philosophy, study of history, linguistic expertise, archeological researches, etc. etc. Theory results in theoretical content each time the name « Moses » is effectively used in a statement.</page><page sequence="26">332 GARTH HALLETT, S. I. Mutatis mutandis, the same can be said of a general term like « water » as of a proper name name like « Moses ». The parallel is obscured by the fact that almost everyone (even a small child) knows that, for instance, water is sometimes fluid; but the kinship of the expressions becomes evident when we reflect that whether the item « fluidity » is communicated de pends on the context of each statement and on the hearer's knowledge of the context. When we speak of the amount of water in the atmosphere or the water imprisoned in the arctic and antarctic ice-caps, the note of (actual) fluidity drops out of the content for a well-informed hearer. Color and taste, too, fluctuate from instance to instance, and are often left indeterminate. A person familiar with the title of Strauss's waltz may be differently influenced by a reference to the waters of the Danube than someone who has actually seen the river, which, as one author remarked, is blue about as often as the moon. A country boy used to sparkling streams may suppose quite a different taste than some city dweller when he reads a remark about water from a tap. And so on. Thus with respect to even the simplest traits of water the word « water » is neutral, much as « Moses » is neutral. This shows that we cannot draw any hard-and-fast line between primitive, « essential » notes on the one hand and theoretical ones on the other, treating only the former as defìning characteristics which belong to the concepì, and ex cluding the latter. This table, too, stands on many legs, and no one is more « essential » than the rest. If anything, the theoretical content has become more essential than the non theoretical. Teli the average American or European adult that you have found some water composed of carbon and oxygen, and he will object and treat your statement as an implicit contradiction. Teli him the water in your thermos tastes foul, speak of the frozen waters of the Volga, say the waters of the Styx are as black as ink, and he will have no difficulty with your statement. The sensible properties are more vari able, for him. And he is typical. Mosi people who hear a statement in English about water in the sky or in a bog or in a piece of ice will believe there to be H20 in the clear, solid, tasteless ice; in the blue, gaseous, tasteless sky; and in the murky, fluid, foul-tasting bog water. The theoretical con tent is the most Constant, and is known to be so by the majority</page><page sequence="27">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 333 of English-speakers. Stili, were someone to contest or ques tion the accepted analysis, the majority would not be com pletely at a loss; they would have the sensible and dynamic properties to fall back on and thereby understand his claim. Thus this term, too, is both theoretical and theoretically neutral. In this analysis I have not aimed at precision in the use of terms like « content », « neutral », and « theoretical »; in faci, I have suggested diiferent senses as I went along, switching for instance from the perspective of intelligible predication in the thesis to the perspective of cognitive content in the anti thesis. In preference to a supposedly « scientific » treatment, relying heavily on personal definitions, I have adopted the attitude of Wittgenstein: « Say what you choose, so long as it does not prevent you from seeing the facts. (And when you see them there is a good deal that you will not say.) » (In vestigations, § 79). You probably will not say, for instance, that « in ordinary language both primary and secondary quali ties are real properties of bodies, and secondary qualities in here in bodies through the mediation of primary qualities »25; nor: « It is undeniable that our everyday interpretations of perceptive experiences, and even ali our every-day words, em body theories »26 ; nor: «the myths current at the time are very much part of the world-view enshrined in the language » 27; nor: « ordinary language always incorporates some kind of theory » 28; nor: « in ali our European languages ' faith ' is seen as an act or activity of man » 28. Nor will you speak of « primitive theories... embedded in ordinary language and or dinary thought, e.g. the view of ' mind ' as a mysterious non physical entity » 30; nor say: « We have to make use of language, which is made up necessarily of preconceived ideas. Such ideas unconsciously held are the most dangerous of ali » 31. 25 E. MacKinnon, Epistemologica1 Problems in the Philosophy of Science, II, in: Review of Metaphysics, 22 (1968-69), p. 353. 26 B.

I. IV. - Import These quotations and the previous case studies reveal the difficulty of balancing neutrality and non-neutrality, and arriving at an accurate assessment of the theoretical content of language. And the diversity of the authors cited and the variety of their immediate concerns demonstrate how frequently the question arises. They may have suggested in addition how important the question can be. As a further illustration of the topic's importance I would suggest that familiar claims about the inadequacy of human language to express divine reality are another instance of con fusing the medium and the message; the limitation, I would say, lies principally in us, in our knowledge and experience, and not in our language. For if a transcendent revelation took place, then the right words were used; and were we acquainted with the transcendent realities spoken of, we would recognize that they were the right words, and would know what was referred to, and could use the same human terms to express what we now do not even glimpse. Such, it seems to me, are the implications of revelation. However, to make the point convincingly would require more space than I can give it here, and I shall develop the suggestion elsewhere. So I shall dwell instead on the following example, of interest to philosophers and theologians alike, as an illustration of the questioni im portance. It seems to me that a strong case can be made for sticking to ordinary terms, with their ordinary meanings, in speculative discussion. After ali, language serves for communication; and communication depends on regularity; and, other things being equal, the more regularity the better the communication. Hence radicai departures from everyday usage, so common in phil osophy and theology, should have strong, special reasons to recommend them. It should be shown that other things are {London, 1349), ρ. xxiv. Greenberg indicates the proper sort of answer for such claims: « to make the proposition true that language contains an implicit metaphysics, one would have to use either the word ' lan guage ' or the word ' metaphysics ' in an unusual way » [quoted by Barr, op. cit., p. 294, with a reference to H. Hoijer (ed ), Language in Culture (The American Anthropologist Ivi, no. 6, part 2, Memoir 79, Chicago, 1954)].</page><page sequence="29">THE THEORETICAL CONTENT OF LANGUAGE 335 not equal and that irregularity may therefore be countenanced. But such a demonstration is exceedingly rare. For the non conforming philosopher or theologian, having done little reflec tion on non-philosophical and non-theological usage, seldom notices his departures from the mother tongue. Nor, therefore, is he likely to detect one prime reason for the well-known difficulties of communication in philosophy and theology, the endless debates, the lack of agreement and progress. Various myths and misconceptions block acceptance of this proposai in favor of ordinary language. People connect it, for instance, with Wittgenstein's alleged thesis that philosoph ical problems arise for the most part from the misuse of language. If philosophers would only speak everyday English or German, he is thought to have held, ali difficulties would disappear. No such thesis can in faci be found, even by im plication, in Wittgenstein's works. But a widespread legend, propagated in part by Russell, makes this view, concerning problems' origin, the basis of Wittgenstein's recommendation that we return to everyday language. And since the explana tory thesis is indeed an implausible one, many people feel they can disregard the methodological proposai which is supposedly based on it. If departures from ordinary language do not beget philosophers' errors and confusions, they need not be feared. Wittgenstein's advice can be ignored. Perhaps commoner is the misconception which here con cerns us: a return to ordinary language is often equated with a return to « common sense ». This error, too, has been prop agated by Russell. It is not surprising, from what we have already seen, that his criticisms of ordinary-language philosophy should take this turn. For an ordinary-language philosopher would defend the ordinary person's right to say that he heard a nightingale, touched a table, saw the sun, and so on; and Russell, having interpreted such assertions as false philosophical claims, would see the ordinary-language philosopher as a cham pion of naive realism who based his view not on scientific evidence or up-to-date analysis of perception but on the mere fact that so many people uncritically claim to see the sun, hear nightingales, and so on. Russell failed to note sufficiently that what everybody says determines the sense of the expres sions and that, most uses not being theoretical, neither are the senses.</page><page sequence="30">336 GARTH HALLETT, S. X. I have developed this point previously. And in discussing Whorf's similar remarks, I have pointed out that Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Aristotle used the same Indo-European language to express their conflicting philosophies. I would now observe, analogously, that radically opposed views can be expressed us ing ordinary words, with their ordinary meanings. Thus it would be possible to express ali that is intelligible in Kant, using everyday German (or English), or ali that is intelligible in Bradley, using everyday English (or German), and so for James, Bergson, Descartes, or St. Thomas. Words would have to be stretched, and creatively exploited, as usuai, but in continuity with everyday usage. For, after ali, that is how philosophers themselves have introduced their readers into their personal conceptual systems (in so far as they succeeded in doing so); they used familiar words with familiar meanings. So it must be possible to reverse the process and get their thoughts back into the mother tongue, eliminating ali radicai shifts in meaning such as I have already illustrated in the case of « see », and such as Wittgenstein had in mind when he recommended that we return terms to the language-game which is their home (Investigations, § 116). The possibility of expressing such diverse systems in everyday terms — of saying even extraordinary things in ordinary ways — shows how mistaken it is to equate his proposai with a return to « mere common sense ». Since the ordinary-language proposai affects the whole phil osophical and theological enterprise, indicating the method to be followed, and since methòd is of such basic importance, so too is the proposai; so is the confusion between common language and common sense, which obscures the proposal's validity. The question of theoretical content has important implications. In concluding, I would cali theologians' attention more particularly to the distinction between theory and theoretical content discussed in the antithesis of my guidelines; it has wide and important applications in questions such as revela tion, doctrinal development, and indeed any theological issue where the informative function of language is cruciai.

RÉSUMÉ Le contenti théorique du langage Le contenu théorique du langage est souvent majoré, de di verses manières: Whorf, par exemple, attribue a ceux qui parlent des langues différentes des conceptions du monde non seulement differentes, mais contradictoires; Russell découvre des doctrines er ronées sous l'emploi ordinaire de mots comme « voir » et « savoir »; James regarde les catégories du « sens commun » comme des in ventions de génies primitifs; Robinson rend raison du vocabulaire d'un peuple par sa philosophie; Chihara et Fodor parlent du génie d'un enfant qui apprend à parler. Bien qu'il y ait du vrai dans de telles assertions, il faut souligner la neutralité foncière du langage: toute théorie qu'on peut énoncer avec sens dans une langue, peut se nier avec sens dans la mème langue. D'autre part, si nous ana lysons le langage du point de vue de la connaissance, nous trouvons un contenu théorique méme dans des termes ordinaires comme « eau » et « lumière ». On peut harmoniser ces deux perspectives en utilisant l'analyse wittgensteinienne d'un nom comme « Mo'ise ». L'importance de ces éclaircissements apparali non seulement à partir des opinions déjà citées mais aussi, par exemple, en se référant à la doctrine affirmant qu'une langue humaine est nécessairement inadéquate pour exprimer le transcendant, ou à l'idée que des phi losophes linguistes, en suggérant un retour au sens ordinaire des mots, proposent nécessairement un retour au « sens commun ».</page></plain_text>
