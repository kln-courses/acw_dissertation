In this article, an examination is made of the Chewong- -a hunting, gathering, shifting, and cultivat- ing group of people in the Malaysian rain forest-and their theory of causality. It is argued that cause is a universal category of human understanding, but that an understanding of cause cannot be separated from a wider examination of the ontology and cosmology in each case. Chewong maintain that the occurrence of specific events may be traced to the correct application of relevant knowledge, that is, knowledge predicated upon a mutuality between humans and a variety of non- human beings that guides daily interaction between them. Keywords: animistic world, causality, cause, Chewong, moral universe, ontology, personhood, sociality Shortly before my arrival in 1977 to undertake fieldwork with the Chewong, a small group of hunter-gatherers and shifting cultivators who live in the rain forest of Peninsular Malaysia, a terrible event took place. The incident - a disas- trous thunderstorm - was still at the forefront of people's minds, and I was repeatedly told about it. Several families were spending the night in temporary shelters in the forest when a heavy storm blew up, accompanied by rain, thun- der, and lightning. A very large tree was uprooted and fell on top of the shelters. Three people were killed outright and two severely injured. Others received minor injuries. It was a frightful calamity, especially in such a small and fragile society where everyone has some kind of kinship relationship with everyone else. When I was first told about it, my reaction was that it was shockingly bad luck for the tree to fall precisely on the sleeping people. However, people Sodai Analysis, Volume 56, Issue 1, Spring 2012, 133-147 Â® Berghahn Journals doi:10.3167/sa.2012.560109</page><page sequence="2">134 I Signe Howell dismissed the notion of luck or chance.1 They had an explanation for why it had happened, and as I learned their ontological and metaphysical principles, I was able to account for the happening in their terms. The identified cause fits into Chewong ideas of causality more generally, and I came to understand that there is no conceptual or moral space for what I would recognize as luck or fortune. To explicate Chewong notions of causality is the purpose of this article. Everyone I asked about the fallen tree gave me the same explanation for why it had happened there and then. It was directly linked to an event that had occurred earlier the same evening. A few people had teased and laughed at some millipedes that had entered the lean-to. To laugh at or near all kinds of animals is a heavily sanctioned act called talaiden. It is one of a number of named prescriptions and proscriptions that constitute the Chewong's semantic and moral universe. These 'cosmo-rules', as I call them, provide the param- eters for meaningful action. There is a direct and specified causal relationship between the infringement of one such rule and the occurrence of an undesir- able event. To perform talaiden arouses automatically the anger of the thunder spirit, Tanko, who lives above in the sky, and the Original Snake, who lives in the primordial sea below the earth. Whenever humans break the talaiden rule, these two beings make thunderstorms and heavy rain. On this occasion, the talaiden offense of teasing millipedes was the direct cause of the storm and the fallen tree. Far from expressing the disaster as misfortune- as bad luck for those in the path of the falling tree- the Chewong asserted that the transgres- sion had caused the event to happen. Although some of those killed or injured had not participated in the breach of talaiden , this was irrelevant for the two spirit beings, a fact that implies that the rule has wide moral implications. To laugh at animals places the whole community, not just the transgressors, in danger. Numerous myths confirm this belief and, in various ways, illustrate Chewong notions of cause and effect. Concepts that are comparable with Western understandings of 'fortune', 'luck', 'fate', or 'chance' are not found in the Chewong's understanding of how the world works.2 Rather than trying to explain why they do not have such notions, I shall show how they conceptualize the occurrence of desirable or undesirable events as these affect both individuals and the collectivity. My focus will be on the metaphysical construction of interaction between humans and non-humans (the animated natural world, deities), which, I will argue, is integral to ensuring the 'good life' for oneself and others. When certain things go wrong- occurrences that the outsider may think of as bad fortune- they are not characterized by the Chewong in such terms. Rather, Chewong ontol- ogy emphasizes how the application of 'correct knowledge' enables humans to control their environment and influence the course of events. Correct knowl- edge in this case consists in adhering to the rules: a direct causal relation- ship exists between behavior and event. Unanticipated happenings can always be diagnosed afterward by reference to preceding behavior, which, in turn, springs out of their cosmology.3 This does not necessarily mean that a perpetra- tor knows about his or her transgression. After an illness or accident, it is only through diagnostic sequences performed by someone with shamanistic ability</page><page sequence="3">Knowledge, Morality , and Causality in a ' Luckless ' Society | 135 that the cause emerges. This enables the relevant parties to counter the effect of their transgression. Alternative Causal Sequences Although cause is one of the Aristotelian categories of human understanding, it has received relatively little anthropological investigation.4 Durkheim was critical of Aristotle's and Kant's apriorism and argued that explanation was to be grounded in sociological terms.5 1 salute Durkheim's project to submit the categories of mind to comparative sociological analysis, but I agree with Lukes, who refutes Durkheim's claim that the categories were derived from the social, asserting rather that they are manifestations of "what thinking is" (Lukes 1973: 447; original emphasis).6 To explain indigenous understandings of causality- that is, how an event (a cause) leads to another (an effect)- is, I suggest, a highly pertinent pursuit. But in doing this, one should not concentrate exclusively upon 'strange' con- nections of magical thinking in specific religious 'worldview' contexts, as has been a tendency in anthropology (cf. Boyer 1992). Theories of causality must be viewed in their totality, in both religious and mundane contexts, argues Boyer (ibid.: 188). 7 1 agree with this, and in my investigation of Chewong causality I argue against a separation between 'magical' and 'normal' causation, a separa- tion that has been an anthropological predilection. As will become clear, as far as the Chewong are concerned, there is no meaningful separation between what one may term nature and culture or, indeed, between society and cosmos (How- ell 1984, 1996). To distinguish between magical and mundane causal sequences in the case of the Chewong is highly inappropriate. Interestingly, however, as I shall discuss below, the cosmo-rules of the Chewong appear to lose their causal potency and cease to serve as guides for action once people move into the dif- ferent ontological and social worlds of the dominant populations of Malays and Chinese that are encountered outside the forest. In other words, the Chewong's cosmological knowledge with its theory of causality is applicable only in their own context. This raises challenging questions of cultural self and other- what Gow and Margiotti (this issue) refer to as "the cosmological 'given'" - which I explore briefly toward the end of the article. From a comparative ethnographic point of view, my argument is that theo- ries of cause are best interpreted as manifestations of ontology and epistemol- oga In an examination of headhunting in Borneo - one of only a few studies that address cause as a category of the human mind- Needham (1976) asserts that there need not be any mystical force to serve as an intermediary between an object and the effect that it produces. He argues that this interpretation is the result of the Western predilection for mystical thinking. In Borneo, he claims, the possession of skulls in itself causes well-being. This is contrary to much anthropological writing, which seeks to identify an intermediary agent that produces well-being from the possession of skulls. Needham's is a cau- tionary tale, one that echoes the famous statement by Hocart ([1952] 1970:</page><page sequence="4">136 I Signe Howell 23) when he asks, "How can we make any progress in the understanding of cultures, ancient or modern, if we persist in dividing what the people join and in joining what they keep apart?" However, I would claim that, unlike the causal sequence case of Borneo headhunters, Chewong understanding of cause and effect does posit an intermediary mystical link between rule and event, namely, the non-human beings whose agency is activated in the wake of a human transgression. In a relentlessly rational system, such as that of the Azande- and, I would argue, the Chewong- there is no room for chance as an explanatory concept. This, of course, was Evans-Pritchard's (1937) great problem in his study of Azande witchcraft beliefs, or, rather, the problem for him was that the Azande did not operate with a concept of bad luck. Instead, when something adverse occurred that, under normal circumstances, ought not to have happened, they insisted on witchcraft as the cause. Today, when anthropologists come across indigenous epistemologies that are founded on a premise that is different from the Western one, they do not experience the same discomfiture that Evans-Prit- chard felt. Such encounters need not lead to questions of primitive mentality (cf. LÃ©vy-Bruhl [1926] 1985). Today, most anthropologists, unlike Evans-Prit- chard, refrain from looking for ultimate truth in matters of epistemologa8 The Chewong explanation for desirable or undesirable events hinges on the possession and application of relevant knowledge, that is, knowledge that is integral to their metaphysics (what is the nature of reality?) and to their ontol- ogy (what types of things exist in the world and how do they relate to each other?). Such knowledge among Chewong is constitutive of daily behavior and is predicated upon elaborations on the concept of personhood (human nature) and on the personhoods of the many non-human conscious beings that inhabit their cosmos. To live with the cosmo-rules as guides for daily action is, I suggest, a kind of ritual act. It brings the humans and non-human conscious beings into a continuous, but prescribed, relationship of mutuality, rendering the rules 'techniques for life saving' (cf. Hocart [1936] 1970: 33, 34). For these claims to make much sense, I need to elaborate upon the principles and values that constitute the Chewong social world- a social world that is co-existent with their cosmos (Howell 1984, 1989, 1996). Chewong: Some Socio-cosmological Features Chewong live in an inclusive, animated, but bounded environment in which humans and many (though not all) sentient animals, plants, and spirits consti- tute a single moral universe. Existentially, humans are not set apart from the other sentient beings (Howell 1984, 1985, 1996, forthcoming). They all interact according to principles that form the basis for correct behavior and maintenance of order and that are expressed as named prescriptions and proscriptions- cosmo-rules. Knowledge of these behavioral rules (or codes for conduct) is essential for individual and social survival in the forest; yet, as mentioned above, its relevance is limited to the Chewong forest world (s). Theirs is a bounded</page><page sequence="5">Knowledge, Morality, and Causality in a 'Luckless' Society | 137 social domain, and it is only within it that the particular Chewong ontological understanding is operative. However, within their world, every Chewong- man and woman- has free access to this knowledge, and everyone knows enough to perform their daily tasks with confidence. Those who seek to know more details and who wish to establish relationships with conscious beings of other species may do so, and, as a result, they are more effective in their dealings with the animate environment in which they live. This applies primarily to diviners of cause on particular or inexplicable occasions and to shamanistic healers. However, this superior knowledge does not enhance their status, nor does it grant them special authority (Howell 2011a). It does not affect their standing as a person by investing them with some quality analogous, for example, to mana , as this is reported from Oceania (Pitt-Rivers 1974). Significance of Chewong Knowledge Chewong symbolic classification is constructed upon a principle of enumera- tion rather than on hierarchical ordering (Howell 1984, 1985). This is also the organizing principle of their social organization, which is thoroughly egalitarian and peaceful (Howell 1989, 2011a). Ontological principles and socio-cultural practice thus co-constitute each other. Existentially speaking, all Chewong persons- including the many species of non-human beings characterized as 'people' {beri)- are equal, with identical person attributes and qualities. The acid test for people status is the possession of consciousness ( ruwai ).9 1 have argued elsewhere (e.g., Howell 1984, 1996, forthcoming) that the Chewong's understanding of the animated world in which they live may be thought of as anthropomorphic or, more precisely, 'Chewongmorphic'. At the same time, each different species of sentient being not only has a distinctive body (see below) but also lives according to the specificity of its own cultural interpretation of the world. Chewong adhere to a psychic and cognitive unity of all species of 'people', yet they are also species relativists. They know that the 'natives' points of view' differ somewhat from each other. This is due to the special qual- ity of the eyes of each of the species that view themselves as people but, at the same time, view all others (e.g., honey bears, gibbons, rambutan fruit, etc.) as having a separate identity. Arguably, the animated world around them consists of many natures but only one culture (Descola 1996). This composite world of many natures may be further described as one in which the common reference point is not humanity as a species but the human (the Chewong) as a condition. This form of cultural (species) relativism (cf. Howell 1984, 1996, forthcoming) bears many similarities to what others more recently have called 'perspectiv- ism' (cf. Ãrhem 1996; Descola 1996; Viveiros de Castro 1998; cf. also Gow and Margiotti, this issue), which Descola (2006) more recently approaches from the point of view of 'collective analogism' (but see Howell, forthcoming).10 The main source for Chewong ontological knowledge is the large body of myths that every individual knows. Apart from entertainment, these myths provide, by example, insight into the principles of the world in which Chewong</page><page sequence="6">138 I Signe Howell live and their epistemology (Howell 1984). In the present context, the myths are endless confirmations about cause and effect with regard to the various prescriptions and proscriptions. They are also constitutive of practical knowl- edge, demonstrating how all people, including sentient animals, plants, and 'things', emerge as conscious and knowledgeable actors. The rules are not only 'good to think'- they are also 'good to acÅ¥ (see Mosko 2009). Who and What Is a 'Person'? Chewong conceptions of being and consciousness are thus central to an inter- pretation of their social world and events within it. As stated, in theory every- thing in the forest may reveal itself to be a sentient being with person qualities identical to those of the Chewong. In addition, there exist a number of immor- tal spirits. All are formally and culturally identical, and their motivations and aspirations are those of the Chewong. This is my reason for characterizing the Chewong animistic world as Chewongmorphic. It is on the basis of this premise that interaction between all sentient species is non-hierarchical, demonstrating the profoundly egalitarian basis for all relationships. Such sentient, conscious beings must possess ruwai - consciousness, rationality. Empirically (in nature), each species is distinguished by its body or 'cloak', as Chewong term the body. Each species has its own special body by which it may be recognized. Cloaks may be put on and off, and those individuals in each species who have sha- manic abilities may in certain circumstances take off their cloaks and put on that of another species. This deception is not apparent (but see more on this below), and these individuals are accepted as bona fide by those whose cloak they have donned. The myths contain many examples of this. Further, the eyes are profoundly important in distinguishing one species from another. Indeed, perception is relati vistic and species-bound. In one sense, all species see the same world and have the same needs; only that which what makes up the mate- rial objects in each world differs. For example, human eyes see the body of a wild pig as potential meat, as pork. A gibbon sees certain leaves as pork. A bas spirit11 sees human ruwai as pork. In the forest there are a number of invisible villages and houses that belong to the different species of conscious beings. To ordinary or 'hoÅ¥ human eyes, they are just clusters of trees or leaves. To the spe- cies themselves, they are houses and fields, just like human houses and fields. While they are in 'their own land', the well-being of these different species is dependent upon the observation of the same prescriptions and proscriptions as those of the Chewong. The causal chain is identical, but again what actually constitutes the offense- and the effect- is species dependent.12 Importantly, those with shamanic abilities who have established a permanent relationship with a spirit guide (also called ruwai ) have 'cooF eyes- as opposed to the ordinary hot eyes. Cool eyes can see through all deceptions of borrowed cloaks and apparent trees that are actually houses and villages of specific spe- cies. They can also send their own ruwai into space during a healing sÃ©ance. On such journeys they meet the various immortal spirits as well as the shamans of</page><page sequence="7">Knowledge, Morality, and Causality in a ' Luckless ' Society | 139 other species. This experience is both a continuous source of new ontological knowledge and a confirmation of the old. During such journeys, some species previously not thought of as people may reveal themselves as such. Others that fail to manifest themselves for some time are forgotten. This animated universe is thus static only in principle, not in actuality. From this I argue that Chewong live in an animistic world in which all species of conscious beings view their own world from their own perspective, but all are unified through the anthropomorphic construction of reality. The law of causality, however, is the same in each case. At the same time, some distinctive features are attributed to individuals, regardless of species. A particular personality is expressed through the quality of an individual's liver. The circumstance of a person being born with a lazy liver or a bad-tempered one or an energetic one helps to explain that person's subsequent acts. But in the world of the Chewong, no value judgments are attached to those whose livers prove to be less than desirable, nor to those whose personal qualities may in a general sense be perceived as admirable. This understanding of personhood is another way in which to explain why some are more successful than others in some tasks. Rather than being com- mented on, an individual's achievement or lack of success is ignored. When I expressed my opinion that a certain man was a very good hunter, the laconic reply was that "all men are good hunters." From the above, it comes as no surprise to learn that there is no social or political hierarchy among the Chewong. Theirs is a society in which peaceful co-existence is not only valued but lived and competition is not a meaningful behavioral category (Howell 1989, 2011a). Retribution for acts of omission or commission is exercised not by fellow humans but by whichever spirit or non- human personage is activated through the disregard of a particular rule. This was the case when the thunder spirit and Original Snake caused the deadly thunderstorm mentioned at the outset of this article. As there are no anti- social acts that fellow Chewong may punish, this further demonstrates how the human social world is intrinsically part of the wider world in which boundaries between society and cosmos are non-existent. The named prescriptions and proscriptions that constitute and guide daily behavior express the intimate connection that exists between the different species in the forest environment, and, invariably, this relationship becomes the source for diagnosis when events need an explanation. Interestingly, Chewong apply causal explanations mainly in cases of misfortune, as in the example of the thunderstorm. There is no need to diagnose the smooth running of daily life; teaching children the cosmo-rules and their implications suffices. Apart from 'natural' catastrophes, another type of undesirable event that requires explanation in the Chewong world is illness. The fear of illness is constantly present, and there are numerous rules to help individuals avoid suc- cumbing to it. Illness happens not by chance but always as the result of some infraction, which may have been committed by oneself or by others. For a cure to be effected, the cause must be identified. For example, to the question of why X became ill, several answers are possible, and a shamanistic interpretation of</page><page sequence="8">140 I Signe Howell the sick person's activities previous to the illness leads to the identification of the cause. One possible explanation is a breach of the numerous rules for food preparation and eating. For example, X may have eaten fruit shortly after eating pork (the chicka proscription), which enabled a certain spirit to enter her body and eat at her innards. This is a well-known causal sequence that people are at pains to avoid. In this case, breach affects the transgressor only, and spells and invocations are usually sufficient to remedy the complaint. On the other hand, X may have become ill because Y failed to observe the punÃ©n rule, which prescribes that all food brought to the settlement from the forest must be shared with everyone who is present at any time. If someone knows that food has been brought back and he or she is not given a share, this will give rise to an emotional state of unfulfilled desire. Such an emotion places the person in a state of danger, making her or him vulnerable to interference from outside forces. The omission enables the tiger spirit {ruwai) to attack X's soul ( ruwai ) and remove it. The punÃ©n rule is one of the most important among the Chewong- arguably, Chewong society itself is predicated upon it. This prescription has clear moral connotations (Howell 2011b), and transgres- sions are potentially fatal. A sÃ©ance may enable a shaman to diagnose the cause and then to retrieve the soul (ruu;a0 by sending his or her own ruwai into the worlds of other animate species to look for it. In this quest, the shaman receives help from his or her spirit guides. Having located the sick person's soul, the shaman must persuade the being who has taken it to let it go. This requires extensive negotiations and exchanges, and if the shaman's knowledge is not sufficient, the person dies. There are many more prescriptions and proscriptions that constitute behav- ior and are integral to virtually all acts, allowing me to argue that they may be interpreted as part of the Chewong category of the person. In fact, I can think of no human act that is 'rule neutral'. Strong emotions and the expression of them are also subject to rules, as demonstrated by the effect of the neglect of the punÃ©n rule and by the talaiden offense mentioned at the outset. The rules are thus much more than taboos because they refer not just to selected social domains or activities, but to the performance of regular living itself. As such, they make up a truly intricate pattern of dos and don'ts. A few further exam- ples will suffice. When weaving baskets or mats, the knots on the leaves or rattan must point a certain way. The same applies when tying beams together on a house. Water and firewood that is carried from the forest to the settle- ment must be referred to by a nickname. Different kinds of game, fish, and vegetables must be prepared separately and cooked in different fireplaces. One must not whistle when in the forest. The afterbirth of a baby must be wrapped in a special leaf and placed in the top of a special tree, and the blood that falls on the ground during the birth must be covered by ashes. Pregnant women and their husbands may not eat certain kinds of foods. Some of these codes for conduct affect the individual transgressor (e.g., chicka) y while others affect those transgressed against (e.g., punÃ©n). Still others affect the whole Chewong community through natural disasters (e.g., talaiden). Theirs is a fragile community, so these rules that carry heavy moral injunctions</page><page sequence="9">Knowledge, Morality, and Causality in a ' Luckless ' Society | 141 are a major factor in the constitution and maintenance of a social world where there is no institutionalized human authority and where no retribution by one's fellow Chewong is possible (Howell 2011a). The rules constrain individual agency at the same time that they provide individuals with substantial freedom over their life in the forest. Never neutral, practice is embedded in and consti- tuted upon cosmological knowledge. Risk and Fortune Risk perception- that is, how people conceptualize, experience, and respond to risk in daily life and to potential future risk- varies considerably between societies. The degree to which people have tools at their disposal to control risk will, of course, also vary. Sociologically speaking, risk factors are not natural facts but social ones, part of the ontology in each case. According to Mary Douglas ([1992] 2003: 50): "We need a way of putting the isolated risk issue into the context of the larger system. " Broadly speaking, risk factors are con- cerned with how disasters are categorized- to what extent and in what ways they are separated from normal events. Examples include destructive storms, floods, and landslides and mishaps and illnesses of every kind. How humans identify and explain risk situations is a question that must be answered by reference to theories of causation in the wider ontological frame. Known risk factors affect the pursuit of livelihood, and the application of culturally correct precautionary measures ought, in theory at least, to be pre- ventive. As argued throughout this article, Chewong risk factors are intrinsically linked to their cosmological understanding and to their theory of knowledge and causality. They are integral to how each person defines his or her respon- sibility in adhering to the moral injunction to live according to the rules. These rules may be thought of as tools to prevent risk situations from occurring; they are constitutive of agency. In performing their daily tasks, humans are not separate from the natural world. Moreover, as there is not one natural world but many, that which is done in one affects other worlds in the Chewong universe. As such, the Chewong universe is highly fragile, but, as stated throughout this article, it is one that may be controlled by the correct application of knowledge. Seemingly chance events are rationalized by reference to minor omissions, placing a profound responsibility upon every Chewong. After I had lived with the Chewong for some months, an incident occurred that illuminates the signifi- cance of knowledge and its part in defining my status as an insider or outsider to the moral community. I joined some children in noisy play while the mother was cooking monkey stew. She immediately admonished me, saying that now that I had learned their way of life, I ought to realize that this kind of behavior was talaiden and put everyone present at risk of dangerous thunderstorms. Although there is a constant risk than someone may fail to observe the rules, this does not mean that the Chewong live in a constant state of anxiety. Far from it. The embodied knowledge of the prescriptions and proscriptions means that they experience a profound sense of control. Children are taught how to behave:</page><page sequence="10">142 I Signe Howell the named rules are evoked by adults many times during the day in response to children's behavior, and the knowledge becomes an embodied part of the person. Chewong children grow up knowing that their sociality extends beyond that of family and fellow Chewong to include the many beings in the environ- ment. The implications of this wider world of sociality are ever present, but it produces fear only when dangerous situations occur, as in the form of illness or natural catastrophe- or in encounters with the unknown that exists outside the Chewong forest world. The same mode of causal explanation operates throughout the inclusive social world of numerous animate species in the forest. Just as Chewong are affected detrimentally when they infringe some prescribed mode of behavior, so too will non-Chewong sentient beings be affected when they fail to observe a rule. For example, transgressions by wild pigs activate humans who may then hunt and kill them. There is a kind of double loop that folds in and out of itself between humans and the many species of conscious personages. Chewong risk is thus very different from that of the Azande, whose epistemology and concept of personhood are such that any individual may be a witch without knowing it. Azande witches operate in secret, even unconsciously, against anyone toward whom they bear a grudge. Azande do not have at their disposal tools to pre- vent witchcraft attack- only tools to identify a witch after the event. No such notions are present among the Chewong. Rather, the survival of the community is dependent upon every individual's continuous performance of prescribed ordered behavior. Some Counter-Evidence Despite the above argument that the Chewong's theory of causality enables them to be at ease in the forest- where they know the rules and experience a sense of control over themselves and others- they do not feel confident once they leave the forest or when they encounter outsiders who have entered it. In the forest, there is a moral and conceptual collapse between nature and soci- ety. But this world is bounded. Those who live outside it cannot be controlled. The cosmo-rules do not operate beyond the forest; they have no effect. Conse- quently, the Chewong experience fear whenever they venture into the outside world of Malays and Chinese, and they are, if possible, even more frightened when someone from that world enters the forest. The crossing of the socio- cosmological boundary represents high risk, and the Chewong are out of their depth. When actual encounters are unavoidable, their primary response is to keep their distance and maintain minimal interaction or, in extreme cases, to run away and hide. But I have discerned one practice (described below) that Chewong deliberately perform in order to protect themselves in the face of danger, namely, the wearing of amulets. Chewong invariably withdraw whenever outsiders penetrate the forest (How- ell 1989). During my first fieldwork, they hardly ever ventured into the outside world. TYading was done on behalf of the rest by a few elderly men who spoke</page><page sequence="11">Knowledge, Morality, and Causality in a ' Luckless ' Society | 143 some Malay. Even they, however, were extremely cautious in their dealings with the Malays and Chinese and hurried back as soon as possible, declining all invitations to socialize. These days, Chewong venture more easily into the outside world, but they keep their distance. Memories of slave raiding are kept alive in people's minds (Endicott 1983), and fear is certainly one factor that guides their interactions. They also fear the illnesses that they contract from the 'hoÅ¥ world of outsiders as opposed to the 'cool' world of the forest. Cosmological knowledge, with its theory of causality, is inapplicable in interactions with outsiders, and the Chewong are without protection. However, during an early fieldwork period, I witnessed a sudden craze for buying amu- lets from the nearby aboriginal Jah Hut group with whom the Chewong have a long-standing relationship and whose cosmology in part overlaps with their own. The Jah Hut claimed to be able to produce amulets that, when worn, would protect the bearer from harmful acts by outsiders, and for a while every- one was eager to purchase them. Upon my return a few years later, their use had been abandoned. People said that they did not work. Two points are perti- nent in this connection. First, as far as I could ascertain, there is no Chewong category that would accommodate amulets. People confirmed that they had not had such powerful objects in the past and that such things were part of Jah Hut cultural understanding and practice. Nevertheless, Chewong willing- ness to accept the potential protective power of the alien amulets demonstrates an openness to new ideas, although in this case the idea came from another indigenous group. Similarly, they are eager to try Western medicines, in addi- tion to their own indigenous ones, but only when they are provided by people whom they know and trust.13 This demonstrates that the Chewong are not locked into a rigid ontological understanding. The fact that the amulets did not become permanently incorporated into their understanding may be explained by the Chewong's own experience of their failure as protective agents. Wearing them outside the forest did not affect outsiders' behavior toward them, they told me. They were as exploited and despised as ever, a situation that is only marginally changing today as Chewong become more exposed to the outside world (Howell 2011b). This raises the second interesting point, addressed by Gow and Margiotti (this issue), about the effects of interactions with outsiders and their ontologies. When people on the Bajo Urubamba speak Spanish, they frequently use the Spanish terms for fortune, luck, and destiny, but only "to talk about things that have little resonance with their own everyday lives" (ibid.). As most Chewong today interact regularly with Malays and Chinese, they learn to master the Malay language for everyday purposes and display some knowledge about Malay and Chinese worldviews. However, I am uncertain as to what extent the concept of luck- which is important to both external ethnic groups- is used by Chewong in Malay conversation. What I am certain of is that, so far, little of these outsiders' ideas and values has been incorporated in the Chewong's own understandings, despite a noticeable decline in the active reference to cosmo- rules among the people who live in new villages on the outskirts of the forest (Howell 2011b). Outsiders' social worlds are available to them, but these worlds</page><page sequence="12">144 I Signe Howell do not resonate with their own, and the idea of linking them is largely rejected by the Chewong. In Conclusion Undoubtedly, human beings everywhere try to protect themselves against undesirable occurrences, and the Chewong are no different in this respect. But there are major socio-cultural differences among the explanations of why and how undesirable events occur. I have argued that the Chewong's understanding of causality in human existence has no conceptual room for luck or fortune. Metaphysically derived knowledge is applied in daily and ritual practice, ensur- ing a life that, ideally, is prosperous and devoid of unwanted or dangerous events. In egalitarian Chewong society, every person is responsible for the correct application of this knowledge for the benefit of oneself and others. The premise for well-being is dependent upon the relationship between every individual Chewong man and woman and the numerous conscious beings that populate their environment. Sociality can be understood only from this per- spective. Theirs is a relationship of symbiosis predicated upon the numerous rules that give meaning to behavior- that direct it and constrain it. Only when rules are not adhered to does misfortune occur, and such events are therefore diagnosed as the result of breach or omission. The conditions for control of Chewong sociality lie embedded in their ontology and the particular concepts of human nature that spring out of this. Cause is a universal category of human understanding in the Aristotelian sense. How causality is conceptualized varies from one society to another, but it is widely assumed that such a conceptualization will include the notion of luck. The Chewong, I suggest, offer an interesting empirical counter-example. They are, in a certain sense, a 'luckless' society. Acknowledgments Fieldwork with the Chewong was undertaken for 18 months during 1977-1979 with a 4-month follow-up in 1981. Since then, shorter visits have been made in 1990, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2006, 2008, and 2010. 1 am profoundly grateful to the many indi- viduals who overcame their fear and reluctance to let me live and work with them and who shared their knowledge with me. I wish to thank Giovanni da Col for invit- ing me to the original seminar in Cambridge in 2007 and for his many encouraging e-mails since that time. I wish to thank Jon-Henrik Remme and Desmond McNeill for reading and commenting on earlier versions of this article and the two anony- mous reviewers, whose comments were pertinent and challenging.</page><page sequence="13">Knowledge, Morality, and Causality in a 'Luckless' Society | 145 Signe Howell is Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Oslo and the author of several books and numerous articles based on fieldwork among the Chewong of Peninsular Malaysia and the Lio of Eastern Indonesia. She has also undertaken comparative research on transnational adoption analyzed as a contem- porary kinship practice. Currently, she is engaged in a study of global efforts to save the world's rain forests. Notes 1. The Chewong language was unknown to me at the time. I spoke an imperfect Malay, but some of the older men mastered a basic spoken Malay. My dictionary gave me the word nasib (derived from Arabic) for 'luck', and I tried to say that I thought their luck had been bad. This provoked no response. Subsequently, I have been unable to discover any indigenous terms that correspond to the notion of luck. This need not exclude the existence of a covert category, but I would argue that other evidence from Chewong ontology and epistemology does not favor such an interpretation. 2. For a comparative interpretation of a similar situation in the Amazon, see Gow and Mar- giotti (this issue). 3. My argument has much in common with the concept of 'onto-praxis' developed by Scott (2007). Scott holds that "anthropological interpretations must situate praxis relative to the deepest level of ontology operative within a given cosmologica! framework" (ibid.: 19). 4. Causality has been central to medical anthropology, but as an instrumental, not a cogni- tive, category. 5. Other sociological terms include ideas of time, space, number, self, and class. For a detailed discussion of Durkheim's sociology of knowledge, see Lukes (1973: chap. 22). 6. Citing a translation of Durkheim's 1912 Les formes Ã©lÃ©mentaires de la vie religieuse, Lukes (1973: 436) further notes that "the categories could be considered as 'essentially collec- tive reprÃ©sentations', which 'depend upon the way in which [the group] is founded and organized, upon its morphology, upon its religious, moral and economic intuitions, etc.'." 7. Boyer (1992) is critical of much that has been going on in the so-called rationality debate. He claims that it has "focused upon product, not process, on the worldviews that accom- modate magical claims rather than on the intellectual operations that make these claims plausible" (ibid.: 188). 8. This does not mean that one need be stuck within a culturalist explanatory frame. Rela- tivism can be used as a methodological tool to throw some light on mental processes more generally. 9. Ruwai is a complex concept that covers several aspects of the spiritual side of humans and other conscious beings, as well as being the term for a shaman's spirit guide (How- ell 1984). 10. This is not the place to undertake a thorough examination of recent contributions to theo- ries of animism. That will be done elsewhere (Howell, forthcoming). Here I draw mostly on my earlier work and, on the basis of this, seek to elucidate the relationship between Chewong ontology and cosmology and the Chewong theory of causality. 11. The bas are a group of spirits that are activated to perform a harmful act upon humans following a breach of a cosmo-rule. 12. The significance of vision is central to many Amazonian societies as well. Gow and Mar- giotti (this issue) argue that the difference "is not in possessing a point of view; rather, it is in the bodies, which determine how beings appear and how they know differently. " This insight may be applied equally to the Chewong.</page><page sequence="14">146 I Signe Howell 13. Chewong classify other indigenous groups as being closer to themselves than the Malays and Chinese. Although the Jah Hut do not speak the same language, it is closer to Chewong than is Malay, and it may be learned without too much difficulty. The Chewong are ambivalent about Western medicine. They speak of it as being untrustworthy because the giver may wish to harm them, but they are eager to try it when myself or others whom they know well offer some. References Ãrhem, Kaj. 1996.
