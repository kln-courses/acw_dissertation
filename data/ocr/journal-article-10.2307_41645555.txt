DIEN A Sixth-century Father's Advice on Literature: Comments on Chapter Nine of Tanshi jiaxun Yan a descendant Zhitui Hf/ŽLÍÉ of those (531-591+) émigrés was of high born status injiankang, who had modern fled the Nanjing, north a descendant of those émigrés of high status who had fled the north and began in 317 to serve at the court of the Eastern Jin. Members of his family had managed to hold on to that status in the subsequent centuries by dint of their continuing ability to meet the high literary standards, even for those in that privileged group, that were required for appointment to office. Yan lived at a time of increasing political volatility. He took part in the campaign against the rebel Hou Jing was brought as a captive to Chang' an when the Western Wei occupied much of Liang territory, and fled to the Northern Qi in a vain attempt to return to the south. He served there as a relatively high official but was brought back to Chang' an when the Northern Qi fell to the Northern Zhou, and ended his career as an official under the Sui. His career in civil and military capacities, and ser- vice both in the north and south under several dynasties, gave him famil- iarity with many aspects of Six Dynasties life. Yan is important in the study of the Six Dynasties chiefly for his work titled Tanshi jiaxun {The Family Counsels of Mr. Tari), a work that, like others of the genre, gave advice and counsel to the junior members of his family. Tanshi jiaxun is especially valuable because Yan was an acute observer and critic of the social and political scene of his time, to which he was able to add descriptions of incidents he had personally experienced, making this a unique social document of the late Six Dynasties period. An earlier version of this paper was delivered at a conference on Six Dynasties literature, Nanjing University, November, 1995, and published in Chinese under the title "Ping Yanshi jiaxun di jiu zhang: Wenzhang pian" , Nanjing daxue Zhongguo yuwen xuexi eds., WeiJinNanbeichao wenxue lunji PiraUt (Nanjing: Nanjing daxue chubanshe, 1997), pp. 599-613.

DIEN One of the twenty chapters into which Yanshi jiaxun is divided deals with literary matters. Yan approached the subject not as a practicing liter- ary figure of any great repute, nor as one dedicated to the criticism of liter- ary works. For that, we would turn to Liu Xie's SÜíSffi Wenxin diaolong 'SC'Li sill, or Zhong Rong's ÍÉÍ$t Shipin S^fpp. Rather, the chapter reveals Yan as an active participant in a culture that placed great value on literary tal- ent, one in which everyone of any claim to learning was expected to be able to appreciate literature and, indeed, to be able to write in a variety of styles well enough to meet the standards of the time. In his chapter, then, we see what was the accepted fund of knowledge, what were the literary tastes of one person of that time and culture, and what advice he wished to pass along to his children. In that sense, Yan's chapter, titled "Literary Compositions affords us a glimpse into the presuppositions and prac- tices of the literary world of that time. The chapter may be divided into some eleven topics. These include genre theory, literary slips that can lead to disastrous results, the impor- tance of being critical of one's own work, the literary contributions of the sages and, by extension, the value of literature to society, the craft of writ- ing, what to avoid in writing, and finally, examples of what he saw as excel- lent poetry. Interspersed throughout are anecdotes and observations of his day. Yan's realistic approach to life prevents his high standards of scholar- ship and ethics as expressed in his writing from becoming a pedantic exer- cise: these were practical tips to his sons on how to get along in a world in which writing both prose and poetry was a precarious, yet essential en- deavor. One comes away from a reading of the chapter, as is the case of the other parts of ïanshi Jiaxun, with a deeper understanding of the time and with an added admiration for the author. Yan opens with a discussion of genre, tracing the various categories of literary effort back to one classic or another, thus bringing to the act of writing the significance and respectability that such a pedigree would pro- vide. He says, for example, that "epistles H and petitions H, warnings /ic, and admonitory inscriptions stem from the Chunqiu Genre stud- ies had become especially important during the Liang, with the compila- tion of Xiao Tong's HfŽÍÉ (501-531) Wenxuan JCM and Liu Xie's (d. 522) Wenxin diaolong.1 Yan certainly knew these works and was aware of the 1 For an excellent discussion of the growth of genre theory, see James R. Hightower, "The Wen Hsüan and Genre Theory," HJAS 20 (1957), esp. p. 513. Yan's phrase about these genres deriving from Chunqiu was cited by E. D. Edwards as an illustration of the effort on the part of the traditional scholar to find sources in the classics for every custom, every 66</page><page sequence="3">ADVICE ON LITERATURE developments in the field of study, although his categories were his own. His own list of the genres that stemmed from Chunqiu differs considerably from Liu Xie's: only "admonitory inscriptions" was listed by both men. Yan did not devote any space to explicating how such genres were derived from the classics. His purpose was simply to emphasize the serious nature of writing and its origins in the classics, so as to provide a backdrop for his next topic. Yan was particularly exercised by the disturbing fact that men of high literary repute had so often come to bad ends. Starting with Qu Yuan 13 ü(, who "made a show of his talent to make himself known, and in so doing uncovered the excesses of his lord,"2 Yan goes on to list thirty-five others who suffered serious setbacks and even death, and interestingly does so without looking at the writings of these men to discern the possible flaws in their characters that could explain such fates.3 The apparent disparity be- tween great literature and the faults of the men who produce it had become a popular topic. Liu Xie, writing in Wenxin diaolong , traced an early expres- sion of this sentiment to Cao Pei WEE , who remarked, "When we look at the example of literary men of past and present they do not look after the details of their conduct, and few would be able to make their way because of [good] name or [adherence to] principles."4 Liu Xie's own discussion closely parallels that of Yan. After the list of writers whom he criticizes, all but one of whom appear in Yan's more extensive list, Liu says writers are not alone in this and he then listed a number of high generals and chancel- lors who might also be criticized. His rationalization then is that if such eminent men had faults, how much less surprise should there be that men in humbler circumstances would also have faults. Personal criticism, too, is thought; WA Classified Guide to the Thirteen Classes of Chinese Prose," BSOAS 12 (1948), p. 770. Zhou Fagao jfjtféřtí points to a similar formulation in Wenxin diaolong { SBCK edn.) 1, p. 5a, where the same five classics are named; Tanshi jiaxun huizhu , Zhongyang yanjiuyuan lishi yuyan yanjiusuo zhuankan ^ W^ilČ/tIÍPŤU 41 (Taipei, 1960; hereafter, TSJX ), p. 52b. 2 According to Liu Xie, Wenxin diaolong 1, p. 7b, this phrase was first used by Ban Gu SEDU in a preface to Lisao ; also see Vincent Shih, The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons (Hong Kong: Chinese U.P., 1983), p. 27: "Ch'ii Yiian was parading his talents and making an exhi- bition of himself." 3 On this same idea, see James F. Cahill, "Confucian Elements in the Theory of Painting," in Arthur F. Wright, ed., The Confucian Persuasion (Stanford: Stanford U.P., i960), pp. 123- 30. 4 Liu, Wenxin diaolong 10, pp. 8b~9b; Shih, Literary Mind, pp. 264-66.

DIEN mitigated by the holding of high office, he says, implying that the writers in his list perhaps were more open to criticism because of their low status. Finally he cites a number of writers toward whom no such criticism has been directed. Yan, on the other hand, is much more analytical and seeks to see in their writing some clue to their misfortune. Like Liu, he then lists a number of literary men who came to a bad end, briefly comments that even kings with literary talent were not necessarily praiseworthy rulers, and supplies a perfunctory list of men who were both talented and who had led exempla- ry lives, but adds that these were few in comparison. He then comments that one sees in the life of those who came to bad ends a flaunting of the individual and a lack of reticence. His conclusion is that their success in literature went to their heads, and that this led to their lack of control and subsequent loss of the prudence necessary to survive. At the end of the section he lists a few names of men who were famous for their literature and yet had avoided catastrophe. The potential dangers that could derive from writing were to be avoid- ed at all costs, and his advice to his sons then takes up how to approach writing. First of all, he cautions them, one should have a realistic appraisal of one's abilities, and if there is no talent, one should not even attempt to be a writer. He offers as a negative example an unnamed gentleman from Bing prefecture. Recently in Bing F prefecture there was a person of gentle breeding who wrote what were laughable poetry and prose poems; and yet he made sport of and despised [the writings of] Xing [Shao] , Wei [Shou] Í® and various other notables.5 Everyone jeered and made fun [of his poetry] but they pretended to praise and speak of it to each other. Fur- ther, he slaughtered oxen and strained wine to lure [those of] fame and reputation. His wife was an intelligent and perceptive woman; she wept and remonstrated with him but this man would sigh and say, "If one's flowering talent is not admitted by one's own wife, how much more so 5 Xing Shao, cognomen Zicai has biographies in Bei Qi shu JtWWi (Beijing: Zhong- hua shuju, 1973) 36, pp. 475-79, and Beishi lífcí (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1974) 43, pp. 1588-93. He was ranked with Wen Zisheng as the best scholar of the state, and died during the latter part of the Northern Qi dynasty. Wei Shou, cognomen Boqi , has biographies in Bei Qi shu 37, pp. 483-95, and Beishi 56, pp. 2023-39.

Until his death he did not realize [any of this]. To be self-aware is to be intelligent,6 but it is certainly difficult.7 Yan then applies his usual good sense to this problem and offers solid advice. He cautions that one should submit one's writings to others for advice and criticism, that one avoid dogmatism, accept advice, and be sat- isfied with a modicum of success, for the number of works of great worth in the history of literature are very few. "But if one does not go amiss in one's style, and the wording and intention are both worth looking at, then one can be termed a talented gentle. If one wants [one's work] to move the world and overshadow the age, then one must wait until the [Yellow] River flows clear."8 Yan then turns his attention to literary craft and the care that it re- quires. His approach is summed up in his use of the simile, that "in general, creating literary compositions is like a man mounting a spirited horse; al- though it has an unfettered spirit, one ought to use a bit and bridle to con- trol it, and not allow it to run wild on the course. If one were to let it have its head it would pile up in the ditch."9 That is to say, control is essential. Yan begins by using anthropomorphic analogies to explain the struc- ture of literary composition:10 6 For this phrase, Zhao Ximing (1705-1787), as cited in TSJX , p. 56b, refers to the Daodejing , chapter 33: S ; Arthur Waley, The Way and Its Power (New York: Grove Press, 1958), p. 184: "To understand oneself is to be illumined." Also interesting is Daodejing, , chapter 24: ibid., p. 173: "He who does his own looking sees little. " Perhaps better is D. C. Lau, Lao Tzu Tao Te Ching (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963), p. 81, "He who shows himself is not conspicuous. " At any rate, the term Ě M&gt; did not have the meaning in Daodejing that Yan uses. Wang Shumin "Yanshi jiaxun jiaozhu" H4Ö:, in Dept. of Chinese, U. of Hong Kong, comp., Xianggang daxue wushi zhounian jinian lunwenji If (Hong Kong: Deluxe Printing Co., 1964) 1, p. 91, points to a quotation of Daodejing in Zhao Rui í!Ü, Changduanjing that no longer appears in modern editions, and the same passage in Shiji ÜB (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1959) 68, p. 2233. Yan has obviously paraphrased the statement using § ßL in a way not current in earlier periods, that is to say, "to see oneself [as others see one]." 7 TSJX, p. 56b [237]; here and below, the page number in brackets refers to the edn. of Wang Liqi , Tanshi jiaxun jijie (Shanghai: Guji chubanshe, 1980); the same pagination is used in the Taiwan rpt. by Mingwen shuju, 1982. s TSJX, p. 57a [239]. 9 TSJX , p. 58b [248].

The term may also mean the precedent or example set by a worthy of the past. By using this term, Yan was able to give additional effect to his simile. 10 YSjfX, p. 59a [250]. Compare this with the formula proffered by Liu, Wenxin diaolong , section 43,/ 9, p. 46. I quote Shih, Literary Mind, p. 226: "It consists of feeling and ideas Iff ^ as the soul, of facts and meaning as the bone and marrow, of linguistic patterns 69</page><page sequence="6">ALBERT E.

Display and show reign rampant at the cost of losing the point, and his hope is that someone with outstanding talent and fame will lead the way to reform these excesses. While Yan complained about the contemporary state of affairs in liter- ature, he was not urging a return to a golden age of the past. On the con- trary, he is equally critical of earlier shortcomings. In his opinion, In the literature of men of the past, there was vast talent and an unfettered spirit, while the form and manner leave contemporary times far behind. But their sewing and basting were coarse and simple; they did not yet make a fine and delicate [stitch]. Our modern musical pitch is harmoni- ous and euphonious, the paragraphs and sentences are in paired apposi- tion, our taboos and avoidances fine and detailed, much more excellent than in bygone days. One ought to use the old structure as the root and the modern phraseology and rhymes as the branches. Both must be pre- served; neither can be especially favored or discarded.11 This leads to a discussion of bygone writers, including his father, whose collected writings had been lost to fire.12 More interesting to us is Yan's discussion of what we might call literary claques in his time, centering on the dispute between the champions of Shen Yue , on the one hand, and Ren Fang iiïïft , on the other.13 Xing Shao and Wei Shou, eminent men at the court of the Northern as the musculature and integument, and... the resonance of the language as its voice and breath. " Basically the same four elements are included in both lists, but the image is carried out differently. Liu had made the choice of phrasing a part of the basic structure, but Yan, by making it the cap of the piece, would seem to give this aspect less weight. 11 TSJX, p. 59a [250]. 12 TSJX, pp. 5ga-b [251]. 13 TSJX, p. 60a [254] ; this passage has been translated in filli by Richard Mather, the Poet Shen ïueh ^441 -513/' lhe Reticent Marquis (Princeton: Princeton U.P., 1988), pp. 61-62.

This of course created poetic factionalism in the North- ern Qi capital, where Yan served as a high official. Zu Ting a contro- versial chief minister, then told Yan that the qualities, good and bad, of Xing and Wei were paralleled in the writing of Ren Fang and Shen Yue. Aside from what those parallels might be and how they might increase our understanding of poetic principles of the time, there may well have been political rivalries involved, beyond those of literary taste. Unfortunately, Yan does not follow up this topic.14 Having spoken in rather general terms, Yan now takes up specific faults that are to be avoided in one's writings. After all, the purpose of his Tanshi jiaxun was to give advice to his sons. Here, Yan clearly focuses on the struc- tural and linguistic aspects of writing, and not the more literary ones of prosody, mood, poetic vision, and so forth, for Yan was not a professional critic, nor a distinguished poet himself.15 Rather, he was a literatus, one whose writing was competent certainly, and who could be expected to turn out what was to be expected of someone of his standing; and so we gain from his comments a sense of the standards by which educated people of his time judged literature. Many of his points stem from a fine sensitivity to the duties and senti- ments concerned with filial piety. The Six Dynasties was a period in which the observance of filial piety reached almost a feverish pitch. Just the read- ing of the Xiaojing came to be thought of as a cure for illness. Yan was 14 Cao Daoheng W Hill has contributed to such a study; "Lun Ren Fang zai wenxueshi shang di diwei" frali in Deng Shiliang filili: et al., eds., WeiJinNan- beichao wenxue lunji (Taipei: Wenshizhe chubanshe, 1994), pp. 607- 22. He writes that Ren Fang's poetry has been criticized for its excessive use of literary allusions and for being out of step with the aesthetic developments in the poetry of his time, but that his strength was in his prose, a form of writing, especially when put to practical use, that was not given serious enough consideration in the critical evaluations of later times. (I wish to thank Prof. Cynthia Chennault for referring this essay to me.) According to Wei Shou's biography, Bei Qi shu 37, p. 492, the antipathy between Wei and Xing was a more general one, and the advocacy of Ren or Shen only a part of that struggle. Each accused the other of plagiarizing the earlier writer that he championed. That account goes on to say that Yan asked Zu Ting about the quarrel and the gist of Zu's answer is pretty much as Yan wrote it, but the sequence and some wording is different. There it says, "When we look at the good and bad [aspects] of Xing and Wei, they are the points of excellence and inferiority of Ren and Shen." Despite the difference in wording, Yan's text is probably the source of the anecdote. The controversy was also mentioned by Alexander Soper, "South Chinese Influence on the Buddhist Art of the Six Dynasties Period," BMFEA 32 (i960), p. 87. 15 His few extant poems have been translated in Albert E. Dien, Pei Ch'i shu 45: Biography of Yen Chih-ťui , Würzburg Sino-Japonica 6 (Bern, Frankfort and Munich: Peter Lang, 1976), pp. 19-22. 71</page><page sequence="8">ALBERT E. DIEN critical of the lengths to which some went, mentioning one man who be- came a laughing stock when it was discovered that the sores on his face, which he claimed were from weeping at the death of a parent, and by which he achieved some social standing, were in fact self-inflicted by means of scoring his face with a castor bean.16 When we review some of Yan's ex- amples of literary transgression of filial piety, we may feel that he was over- ly sensitive about the issue. Yan's first category is the careless choice of topics and use of terms. For example, the pojing is an animal that eats its father, and so it was a poor choice as a theme of a/w by Wujun .17 Yet, the owl eats its mother, and Yan did not complain about the piece on that theme by the Duke of Zhou in the Shijing . To take another example, the phrase "respectfully the same Í&amp;IrI " occurs in the Xiaojing in reference to one's father, and so it should not be loosely used in the titles of poems that were being written to harmonize with someone else's poem.18 The last of this category must surely be considered rather trivial, and Yan may have cited them with tongue in cheek. During the Liang period a poem by Fei Chang said, "I do not know whether it is or is not ."19 Here, " ye" IP is a homonym of uyen (father), and by introducing a pun, the line may be read, "I do not know if it is father or not." Yan continues: A poem of Yin Yun's said, "Bobbing about in the cloud-mother (yunmu , that is, mica) boat." [The emperor] Jian wen said, "Chang did not recog- nize his father and Yun moreover set his mother bobbing."20 During the Six Dynasties period the use of fanqie SÍU, or dimidiative spelling, was developed in order to indicate pronunciation. Two graphs, A 16 TSJX, p. 67a; Teng Ssu-yii, Family Instructions for the Ten Clan (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1968), p. 110. 17 YSJX&gt; pp. 6oa-b [250]. Wujun, cognomen Shuxiang (469-520), has a biography in Liangshu 49, pp. 698-99, and Nanshi 72, pp. 1780-1. He wrote in a factual and antique style, which attracted a number of imitators. His collected works are listed under one title (twenty juan) in Suishu (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1973) 35, p. 1077. i» rsjx, p. 60b [255]. 19 Fei Chang, a man ofjiangxia ÍXM, near the modern Wuchang in Hubei, is briefly mentioned in Nanshi 72, p. 1783, as one skilled in writing yuefu. Emperor Wu of the Liang once admired and praised a marching song that he wrote. 20 TSJX, p. 60b [255-56]. Yin Yun I has no biography in the standard histories. Lu Wenchao (1717-1796) suspected that the person meant was Yin Yun (471-529), who has biographies in Liangshu 41, p. 596, and Nanshi 60, p. 1489. He wrote a poem record- ed in Wang Shizhen Ûfëf (1634-1711) et al., Gushiji (Wenshutang cangban 72</page><page sequence="9">ADVICE ON LITERATURE and B, were necessary to "spell" C: the initial of A and the final, with tone, of B were joined, indicating the pronunciation of C. Yan warns against placing two graphs together whose fanqie combination might be seen to be a subtext. For an example, Yan drew on Jinlouzi , a work by his former patron Xiao Yi WW (emperor Xiaoyuan of the Liang; r. 552- 554) that mentions a certain writer's use of the Shijing phrase "beating the drums (fagu )," since it could be read as the dimidiative spelling of fu "father." Yan has already made it clear that this would fall under the category of a careless use of terms, and one should avoid such expressions.21 According to Yan, a further area of caution was in alluding to earlier works in inappropriate contexts, for one needed to be sensitive to the issue of the death of one's parents or elders. It would be a great error if when facing north to serve one's parents [there were a recitation of] the chant of "Weiyang iff " penned on parting from a maternal uncle,22 or when in the courtyard caring for one's elders [there were reference to] the grief broadcast at Huanshan fe UU when a brother was sent away.23 I but raise this one corner; treading this road, you ought to be careful.24 n.d.) 100, p. 12a, but it does not have the line in question. The mica boat of course was one decorated with mica. Zhao's commentary to this line, TSJX, p. 60b, mentions that Chuxueji by Xu Jian (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1962) 25, p. 610, quotes Jin gonggeji "if ìli iSsö , which mentions such a vessel.

The emperor Jianwen was Xiao Gang ÏKM (503-551)» who was made heir to the Liang throne in 531 but reigned as emperor for only the last year of his life. This example of his witty criticism was cited by John Marney, Liang Chien-wen Ti (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1976), pp. 70-71. 21 YSJX, p. 60b [255-56]. Jinlouzi (SKQS zhenben edn.) 6, p. 11b, cited a poem by Bao Zhao SSBIa (4 1 47-466) (Wenxuan 22, p. 24a, and Bao shi ji [SBCK edn.] 5, p. 4b).

DIEN The poem "Weiyang" was written by duke Kang JÜ after he had ac- companied his maternal cousin, the future duke Wen X of Jin, to the bor- ders of Jin. The sight of the cousin, referred to in the poem as jiu shi MR, that is, of the family of the maternal uncle, brought to mind his dead moth- er. The poem therefore has the special connotation of the death of this parent.25 For Huanshan, it is said that Yan Hui MIH , a disciple of Con- fucius, on hearing the sounds of weeping, said such sounds were produced by separation with the living and he referred to an incident he had wit- nessed at Huanshan were a mother bird had made sounds of grief as its young left the nest. On inquiry, it was discovered that to pay for the funeral of his father, a man was selling one of his sons.26 Another area warranting caution was writing a piece in the voice of another. While references to parents were meant to be the parents of those for whom the piece was written, still these were one's own words, and so ought to be subject to those same feelings and emotions mentioned above. In general when substituting for another to compose a text everyone writes as if it were that person's words. That is reasonable and proper. But com- ing to phrases of sorrow, injury or evil misfortune, one should not hastily act as a subsitute.27 One of the examples cited by Yan came from Cai Yong He. (133- 192), who once wrote on behalf of Hujinying a Report to the Spirit on the occasion of the death of Hu's mother; the recitative portion said, "I grieve my mother's not being immortal... Why has she abandoned us and died so early."28 Yan concluded that there were many such examples of authors applying to others emotions that should be reserved for one's own parents, since that which the ancients practised was to be avoided in, as he said, "our modern age." 25 Zhou's commentary at TSJX, p. 61 a, refers to an anecdote in Bei Qť shu 34, p. 453, in which Yang Yin $§fa , as a boy who had already lost his mother, when asked by his maternal uncle if he had yet studied "Weiyang," burst into tears. 26 Yan seems to have interpreted the person sold into slavery as the son of the deceased rather than his grandson. 2?

The significance of Yan's comments can only be understood in the context of the heightened, even exaggerated, sensitivity in matters relating to filial piety during the Six Dynasties period. Of even greater consequence in Yan's day was to apply to lesser persons language formerly related to emperors. For example, Pan Ni's ífIJE "A Poem Presented to Lu Jingxuan" said, "The fifth nine; we think of the flying dragon."31 In the Yijing , the fifth undivided line of a hexagram (jiu wuŤL S ) is defined as yang and represented by the number nine. Such a line in the "Qian hexagram of the Yijing reads: "A flying dragon in the sky; it is advantageous to meet a great man •" From this line, jiu wu became an allusion generally to the position of ruler, and the "flying dragon" has been taken to refer to the appearance of a sage who is to become emperor. Thus the line becomes inappropriate if addressed to an ordinary man. Yan concludes 29 TSJX, p. 62a [261]. Cao Zhi, prince of Chen , posthumously Si ® (192-232), has a biography in Sanguozhi (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1979) 19, pp. 557~77- The piece is found in Cao Zijian ji Hf-FÜrlH (SBCK edn.) 9, pp. i8b-2ob, and Ouyang Xun Yiwen leiju (Taibei: Xinxing shuju, i960) 13, pp. ia-2a. The line in question (9, p. 20b) is M HI - "The inner door once shut, may the venerable spirit eternally hibernate." This was a well-known gaffe. Wenxin diaolong, section 41, 9, p. 1 a, said this use of the word suggests an insect and to make such a remark in reference to one so venerated constitutes a flaw in Cao Zhi's writing. See also Shih, Literary Mind, p. 217, where a line has unfortunately been dropped. Xiao YVsJinlouzi (see n. 21, above) 4, p. 13a, made the same comment with- out reference to Wenxin diaolong , which certainly must have precedence, and ended the pas- sage by saying, "Is it not laughable?" 30 YSjfX, p. 62a [261].

Wenxin diaolong , section 41, 9, p. ib, criticizes his reference to being moved by traces of saliva when he grieves for a wife's brother. However, He Yixing , as cited by Zhou, YSJX, p. 62a, noted that neither the reference to the perspiration from the hands nor to saliva are to be found at present in Pan's collected writings. As Liu Xie adds, the passage about such traces in Li ji (SSJZS edn.) 30, p. 20b, refers to one's parents and Pan has applied this emo- tional response to a person of less exalted rank. 31 YSJX&gt; p. 62a [261].

DIEN such examples by saying, "Any who would use such words today would be an offender in the eyes of the court."32 Yan was a stickler for accuracy and precision, and he drilled his chil- dren on this. It is thus very natural for him to turn his attention to the careless use of allusions - errors that in his opinion detracted from the value of the work. He introduced this topic by saying it was a fault of long standing, but since some texts had not survived, he does not dare to discuss those for which there is inadequate evidence. I will mention only two of his examples, those that he said are clearly in error. The Odes says, "Greatly cherishing are one's brothers" iL® 52^ . Kong means "greatly," huai "to think of," and the line means one is thinking of smother a great deal.33 Lu Ji lîtlfil, in his letter to Matron Gu Ü of Chang- sha, when he told of the death of Shihuang , his paternal second cousin,34 then said, "It pained my heart and plucked at my brain fit Sii , it was as if he were a 'gready cherished [one]' W#P?L1Ü ." When one's heart is pained it then means that the matter is deep in one's thoughts; for what reason does he say "it is like" (making konghuai a noun). Looking at its meaning as he used it, then it would be to call one's sibling brothers the "greatly cherished ones" [which would be an error].35 The Monograph on Curious Objects ( Tiwuzhi MfâJïË) says: "The yongjian WM (literally, 'holding a sword') has a shape like a crab, but one nipper is flat and large." He Sun's ÍŘIIS poem says, "The fish leaps as if it were 32 TSJX, p. 62b [261]. For the quotation from the Qian hexagram, see ft/mg (SSJZS edn.) i, p. 5a. 33 Shijing 9.2, p. 13b: • Legge, She Kingy p. 251, translates the couplet: "On the dreaded occasions of death and burial, it is brothers who greatly sympathize." Kong ?L in the meaning of shen S appears in Erya M 51 (SSJZS edn.) 3, p. 14a. 34 Lu Ji (261-303) has a biography in Jinshu 54, pp. 1467-81. There is no record of who this cousin might have been. Jinshu 77, pp. 2023-24 gives the names of two, Lu Ye , cognomen Shiguang and Lu Wan ^C, cognomen Shiyao These two men had four more brothers (Xin Tangshu [Beijing: Zhonghua, 1975] 73B, p. 2968), whose cogno- mens are not known There is also no indication who the woman named Gu of Changsha M fp may have been; Taipingyulan 695, p. 3a, cites a line from a letter by Lu to the furen of Changsha; see also Quanjin wen è 97, p. 11 a, in Yan, Quan shanggu sandai Qtn Han Sanguo Liuchao wen. 35 TSJX, pp. 63a-b [266-67]. Yan's point is that konghuai is descriptive of the relationship between brothers, and it is wrong to use it as a term for brothers. Zhou, TSJX, p. 63b, cites an example of the use of konghuai in Xujingzong (Tang), Wenguan cilin ÍÜÍírÍ# (Guyi congshu edn.) 691, p. 8b, "to be envious toward a younger brother and willing to do any evil is to destroy the feelings of 'great cherishment."' This use, however, would be fully approved of by Yan. A more appropriate example to illustrate this error is that of Wang, "Yanshi jiaxun jiaozhu," p. 95, and is taken from Hongmingji (!Tedn., no. 2102), vol. 52, j. il, p. 75c, where kong huai is used parallel to jiu zu fllM . 76</page><page sequence="13">ADVICE ON LITERATURE holding a sword." This is to confuse fish with crabs.36 Other errors to which Yan has reference are the errors of graphs, such as wu J§ used for niao H , and yin Ü for lang SI 37 By now Yan has passed beyond filial piety and is concerned with cor- rectness in drawing on the enormous corpus of literature available to writ- ers of his day. Related to the above are errors in geography, for the sake of enhancing the mood of the poem, or simply piling on exotic names, de- spite their inappropriateness. For example, "Grand Protector of Yanmen Ode"38 by Xiao Gang, the emperor Jianwen of Liang, reads, W9W&amp; B SË Goose troops39 attack Rizhu,40 The cavalry of Yan41 lay waste to Sogdiana;42 ^^3 If if IS Ferghana sends back excellent steeds,43 The Little Yue bring a letter of surrender.44 36 YSJX, p. 63b [267]. Txwu zJii was compiled by Yang Fu (Han). A Qing recension is included in Congshu jichengM9M$í ( Shanghai: Shangwu yinshuguan, 1936), but this item is not included. He Sun, cognomen Zhongyan fall, has a biography in Liangshu 49, p. 693, and Nanshi 33, p. 871. The line as it appears in Gushiji 93, p. 12a, differs slightly, reading M 37 YS JX, p. 63b [267], and p. 64a [267], respectively. 38 Two yuefu with the title mentioned by Yan are attributed to Xiao Gang in Guo Maoqian (Song ),Tuefii shiji (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1979) 39, pp. 574~75&gt; but il is an_ other, said to be by Chu Xiang (505-548), that contains the lines cited by Yan; ibid. 39, p. 575. The only difference is that for ejun WsW Chu's poem has rongche . Gushiji 102, p. i ib, assigns the poem to Chu Xiang with no note of any problem of attribution. Yiwen leiju 42, p. 6a, credits Xiao Gang, but it is a shortened version without the lines criticized by Yan. On the basis of parallelism, ejun suits better than does rongche , and one might surmise that two poems have become mixed at this point. However, the rhyme -iwo runs through the whole, lessening the chances of that possibility. Yanmen /fÜF"! commandery was a border outpost north of Dai in Shanxi near the Yan- men Pass. 39 The term Goose Troops, ejun, derives from Zu0 zhuan Žif# (Zhao 21) (SSJZS edn.) 50, p. 8a, which mentions two battle formations, one the "Crane" and the other the "Goose"; see James Legge, Ch'un-ts'ew with the Tso Chuen (Hong Kong, preface dated 1872), p. 689. 40 The Rizhu B ^ prince was a high rank in the Xiongnu hierarchy given to the younger relatives of the ruler; see Hou Hanshu 89, pp. 2944-45, for a complete list of the titles. 41 The cavalry of Yan is an allusion to Zfianguoce lie §1 Sit (SBCK edn.) 9, p. 2b, where Su Qin HfH , in outlining the military resources of Yan, includes 6,000 cavalry. 42 For Kangju JÜ®, Sogdiana, see Edouard Chavannes, Documents sur les Tou-kiue Occiden- taux (St. Petersburg: Academie des Sciences, 1900), pp. 132-47. 43 For Ferghana, Dayuan , and the "blood-sweating" horses, see Homer Dubs, The History of the Former Han Dynasty (Baltimore: Waverly Press, 1941) 2, pp. 132-35.

DIEN As is clear from these lines, places and periods were mixed together in a heavy dose of foreign and border names and peoples, a collage Yan re- jected. The poet had been interested only in the exotic effect and the con- trast between the last two lines: "I have sent word to my mate in the women's quarters, Do not repine at the emptiness of the cold bed." But as Yan warns, "This is like the flaw in a bright pearl or a blemish in a piece of beautiful jade. One ought to be careful of it."45 This last begins to sound rather pedantic: does one really expect a poem to reflect geographical accuracy when that gets in the way of the mood of the poem? Perhaps Yan, himself, felt he had gone far enough in this direction, and that his children had gotten the point, because he next changed course entirely, and began discussing what he rated as excellent pieces. What one notices here is that Yan's criteria of excellence are feel- ing and emotional impact, and that they do not lend themselves to the kind of explicit rules with which he dealt up to this point. But what does come through here is Yan's sensitivity to the beauty of the literature, and his impatience with what he felt was carping criticism. Wang Ji's iE® "Poem on Entering Ruoye Stream" says, "The cicada chirps, The woods are even quieter The bird sings, the moun- tain is more gloomy Äiftlil ."^That is to say, such sounds only em- phasized the stillness and gloom. The poem was considered superb by southern connoisseurs, emperors Jianwen and Xiaoyuan being especially taken by it. But in the north, it was felt by some "not to consist of [sensible] language; how does it serve [to demonstrate] ability?" Yan then continued, "The Odes says, 'The sound came of the horses neighing, Slowly moved the standards and banners.' The Mao commentary says, 'It speaks of there not being any shouting or hubbub.' I always sigh over the emotional range of this explanation. Ji's poem came from just this notion."47 off from the main body during their trek westward, ca. 138-126 bc; Hanshu vUlr (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1962) 96A, p. 3891. See also W. W.

For example, Lu Sidao ISSU , a northern scholar, and his group did not consider the poem elegant enough. He himself "loved its quiet and relaxed air as if [the scene] were before one's eyes."49 CONCLUSION There are not many critiques of Six Dynasties literature that have sur- vived, and so, especially given its length and detail, Yan's chapter is an important source of information concerning the literary ambiance of that time. It has been treated by a number of scholars who have written on Six Dynasties literature, but in general, they see its importance chiefly as rep- resentative of a regional school or for its possible influence on subsequent developments. Luo Genze , for example, emphasized Yan's criticism of the frivolity and superficial poetry of his time, and saw in Yan's emphasis on character and moral conduct an example of the "northern school" as con- trasted with that of the south.50 And yet, as we have seen, Yan was a north- erner only very tenuously, his family having been in the south for eight generations, and the main emphasis in his chapter is not so much moral character as it is sobriety and care in the use of language. Guo Shaoyu ?| said that Yan's prescription to cure the ills of the literature of his time, to combine the structure of the past with the modern wording and rhymes, had no influence on the change from the parallel style to that of sanwen %L~$C or prose, but his views were a harbinger of the direction in which Tang poetry developed.51 i95°)j P- I23-24: M(Whistling=) with light whinnies the horses neigh; long-trailing are the pennons and banners." 48 As Zhao remarks, given in YSJX, p. 64b, the same lines are given in an addendum to Xiao Que's biography in Bei Qishu , 45, p. 628, followed by the comment that it was appreci- ated by those who understood sonority ^b1. In Gushiji 120, pp. i7a-b, the title of the piece is given as "Thoughts in Autumn" .

DIEN On the other hand, Chen Zhongfan ISŘIÍ/Íj suggested that the "Return to the Ancients" movement $Ü~¿iWW] had its origin in the dissatisfaction of northerners with the superficiality and ornateness of southern literature and that Yan's writings were the first manifestation of this movement.52 In all these cases, selected passages in Yan's chapter were cited, but the totality of the chapter was not brought to the attention of the reader. The Japanese scholar Hayashida Shinnosuke #EBfX5liÖJ , on the other hand, has made this chapter the focus of a detailed study, seeking the sources of Yan's views on literature and, rather than finding them in the "northern mental climate," he cites the moral bent derived from a tradition in Yan's family combined with the tragic experiences he underwent. Hayashida con- cludes that Yan's wish for a refined literature in which there was a harmo- nious synthesis of ethics and aesthetics, as Hayashida puts it, and his criticism of contemporary literature for lacking that balance, in some sense, foretold the efflorescence of Tang literature.53 The studies by these distinguished scholars offer valuable insight into the literary developments of that period, but as a historian, rather than a literary critic, I would prefer more substantiation of Yan's role in these developments. For example, did Han Yu , the central figure in the Return to the Ancients movement, cite Yan's development on his own think- ing? Setting aside later developments in Chinese literature, what we see in Yan's chapter on literature are the views of a learned member of the elite shi dt and an active participant in the literary activities of the time. Because these were the views of Yan himself, then in order to evaluate them we need to look at how they reflect Yan's character. My own reading of this chapter leads me to conclusions close to those of Hayashida, although I would perhaps emphasize more the political cli- mate in which Yan lived, combined with his own personal struggle to over- come what he saw as deficiencies in his character. Yan was orphaned at an early age and raised by his older siblings. He later blamed the faults he found in his own character on the indulgent way in which they raised him, and he used the metaphor of the grindstone to explain how he smoothed out his defects. As a young man he entered what promised to be a distin- guished career, and in the opening lines of a poem in which he described that period, one can see the exhuberance and optimism of youth: 52 Han Wei Liuchao wenxue (Hong Kong: Shangwu yinshuguan, 1964), p. 1 1 7* 53 "Gen Shisui no seikatsu to bungakukan" H/ČLÍfĚ t Mhon Chügoku gakkai ho, 14 (1962), pp. 107-24. 80</page><page sequence="17">ADVICE ON LITERATURE +££FgTfllr At fifteen I was fond of the Odes and [ Book of] Documents , - At twenty I flicked [the dust from] the cap and [entered] service.

DIEN tique of literature were very much shaped by his own experiences, and one may need to take care not to generalize too broadly about the acceptance of his views by his contemporaries. But, as we have seen in the lines of poetry that he cited with appreciation, there was still in his character the ability to respond with emotion and aesthetic appreciation. From his writings, it is clear that Yan Zhitui was a cautious person all too familiar with the vagaries of life in an uncertain time. The purpose of his Tanshi jiaxun was to counsel his children how to maintain their favored status as potential candidates for official employment and to avoid sinking into the commoner class. For his children, as for Yan himself, social posi- tion and a career as a functionary depended as much on literary skills as on family background. It is no wonder then that Yan attached such impor- tance to the subject of literary composition to the degree that he devoted a whole chapter to the subject. It may seem to some that Yan's comments on writing are narrowly focused and amount to little more than finicky nit- picking. But that is a judgment that ignores the context of his situation and the times in which he lived. For Yan and the greater majority of his peer group, these considerations were of much importance and could make or break one's career. Literature was at once a powerful and a dangerous tool. His approach to writing was of a pragmatic sort, founded on an apprecia- tion of what one did or did not do in order to maintain one's credentials as a competent literatus, as someone able to hold one's own in circles where one was judged by one's literary skills. Viewed in this light, Yan's discus- sion, as with much of the rest of the contents of his Jiaxun, provides valu- able insight into the life and thought of his times.
