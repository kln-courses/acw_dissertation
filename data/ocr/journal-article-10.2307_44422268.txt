Timothy Weaver What is humor? This question has been answered in a serious manner by such behavioral scientists as Aristotle, Freud and more recently by Ralph D. Piddington. Humor has also been a topic for analysis by humorists themselves, such as Mark Twain and Max Eastman. Military training researchers have joined those studying humor. Since humor has been a topic of philosophers, psychiatrists, sociologists, educationists, "militar- ists" and humorists, one might search for threads of agreement in their work. This paper will pursue that end. Max Eastman (1936) defined humor as enjoying something unpleasant as funny. And while this appears somewhat general, it serves to construct a premise for this paper: Humor may be viewed as a process. Borrowing from George Gerbner (1960), humor as a process can be viewed as a flow of events so interrelated that one act in the series derives significance from all others and can only be fully grasped in the perspective of the total. The remainder of this paper will discuss three components of the humor process and related communications research. The components are (a) the ludicrous situation, (b) the perception of the ludicrous situation, and (c) the response. Mrv Weaver, a doctoral student at Syracuse University, and a research librarian, is half of the cartoonist team of Short and Weaver. Ludicrous situation A ludicrous situation might be thought of as a social happening in which some conflict is evident. Apparently, all situations must have a potential for conflict, if they are to be judged as ludicrous. For example, wit leads one in a direction that is unex- pected, and the pun utilizes the semantic in an incongruous way. Jack Markow (1967), dean of American cartoon- ists, has categorized eight types of gags, each of which in pictorial form or in combination with verbal wit, presents a conflict. His gag taxonomy includes the (1) hidden ele- ment, (2) understatement, (3) the reverse, (4) huge and tiny, (5) antique and modern, (6) shop talking, (7) surprise ending caption and (8) habits and customs. The last category, habits and customs, is of particular interest because Ralph Piddington (1933) also dealt at length with the social nature of humor. He described the ludicrous situation as one in which two or more conflicting social evaluations are simul- taneously applicable to a given situation. For example, a cartoon that Short and Weaver had published in Educational Technology showed an anthropomorphic teaching machine and a bum sit- ting on a park bench. The machine was saying to the hobo, "I was displaced by a little old lady with a piece of chalk." EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY / March 30, 1968 g</page><page sequence="2">Computers are Human Computers are Antihuman Two conflicts are readily evident, one in the machine turned human and other in the reverse caption. Apparently when socially ascribed codes, which in a sense represent the ideal system of evaluating phenomena in the social world, are defied by a real event, the potential is created for conflict and subsequently for the ludicrous situation. H. D. Duncan (1962) also recognized the ludi- crous situation as a conflict between the real and ideal evaluations of social phenomena, particularly with regard to comedy which often pokes fun at institutions. In comedy, Duncan said, "Only to the degree the institution is idealized can there be sufficient inconsistency between the ideal and real to excite laughter." The perception The second element In defining a process of humor is perception. Conflict between real and ideal social evaluation must be perceived by the individual, and the perception must be made in a particular frame of mind. Seeing a cow in church in India may not be perceived as conflicting, but normally in our society such a situation would present a conflict. When such a potential conflict occurs it must be accom- pained by a frame of mind described by Eastman as "in fun." In other words, the perception of the ludicrous must not be accompanied by deep feelings of anger or fear. When one perceives a situation "in fun," a shift in values takes place. Pleasant things are still pleasant, but disagreeable things, "so long as they are not disagreeable enough to spoil the fun," are perceived as pleasant and result in a response of laughter. Fear, anger or some other feeling not in fun may inhibit laughter and destroy an appreciation of the ludicrous. A good example of the perception of conflict as too serious appeared in John Dempsey's (1966) article on computers and humor. He cited a cartoon in Punch in which one laborer said to another, "Wait 'til automation reaches management level - then we won't hear so much about 'learning to live with it.' " "That," said Dempsey, "isn't funny, because too much anger breaks through - and possibly too much serious truth, too." The response Perhaps the least understood element in a humor process is the relationship that apparently exists between the perception of a ludicrous situa- tion and the response of laughter. Why do people laugh when confronted with a given situation, rather than cry or respond in some other way? 10 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY / March 30, 1968 11 1 don't believe computers are really Interested In this nation's youth..." "It's a get well card for my computer..!1</page><page sequence="3">Piddington's explanation is the most clearly defined. According to him, laughter is the appropri- ate conditioned response to the ludicrous situation because of psychic compensation, which takes the form of exaggerating the opposite character. A tendency may produce a behavior of a type exactly antithetical to that which would be its natural expression. For example, an unpleasant feeling of inferiority may lead to an inordinately self-confident or boastful attitude. Compensation apparently acts to provide a barrier to any thoughts which do not harmonize - a kind of psychic whistling in the dark. Laughter becomes psychic compensation be- cause all ludicrous situations necessarily appear to be subversive - though never seriously - to the social order, and laughter is the exaggerated opposite of disapproval. Ludicrous situations do not harmonize with the individual's perception of the ideal, and laughter is the adopted response which tends to keep from consciousness the disharmonizing thought. Laugh- ter breaks the train of thought, driving from con- sciousness the disharmony and at the same time affirming through communication entire satisfaction with the situation. While not using the term psychic compensation, Duncan also alludes to the concept of exaggerating the opposite through the individual's expression of satisfaction with a less than satisfactory situation. Laughter at comedy may be the result of "our sudden reassurance that while some aspect of authority is threatened, the principles of authority are not." He further concluded that laughter is a reaffirmation of social bonds and creates social euphoria. Such laughter results from a self-guilt and "purges us of fear and guilt by binding us together in sudden deep ecstacy." In summary, a thread (although it may have several loose ends) can be discerned among the ideas of these serious students of humor: Laughter, by establishing a feeling of well- being or euphoria, is an appropriate re- sponse because it prevents the eruption of disharmony that the ludicrous situation would otherwise cause. In this regard, laughter as a response to the ludicrous may be viewed as a kind of release valve for the conflicts seen in our social world. With the increasing rate of technological develop- ment and accompanying change, laughter can be a quite important communication medium. Related research Sociologists have been infatuated with the con- tent of humor, particularly in the comic strips. Several classic studies have investigated the mes- sages from Little Orphan Annie and Dagwood Land, but few examples could be found which experiment- Computers are Superhuman Computers are Subhuman EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY / March 30, 1968 11 "It corrects your mista Ices even befóre you know you make it..." "... even the computers are finding school tough ."</page><page sequence="4">ally test a theory of humor including the ludicrous situation, perception and laughter. Another favorite aspect of humor has been in- vestigated by the psychologists. The relationship between "sense of humor" and such personality traits as attitude and intelligence has been studied since the 1920's. According to Anne Cunningham (1962) the evidence is somewhat equivocal. The early studies indicated a relationship between intelli- gence and sense of humor, but the latest studies do not support such a finding. Of the three elements used in defining a pro- cess of humor, only the ludicrous situation has been experimentally tested. Spiegelman's (1952) research lends support to the concept that conflicting evalua- tion is an important part of the ludicrous situation in cartoon strips. An analysis of comic strips in American news- papers revealed that there was an inverse relation- ship between caricature and reality of the situation in comics. The real settings in terms of contempo- rary rural or urban life most frequently presented caricature figures (unreal features such as Snuffy Smith). The "irreal" settings were most likely to present non-caricature protagonists. The study also revealed that animals were more likely to be in comic strips that were judged humorous, leading the researchers to infer that some humor may be created simply by placing "an anthropomorphized animal in an incongruous situation." Some efforts have been made by writers, such as Jack Markow, mentioned earlier, to categorize or establish a taxonomy of conflict situations. John Dempsey's (1966) article, while not empirical or ex- perimental research, is in agreement with conflict theory. In Why Automation is a Laughing Matter, Dempsey developed four categories of jokes about computers. Each represents a type of conflict: (a) computers are human, (b) computers are anti-human, (c) computers are superhuman, and (d) computers are subhuman. He gave several examples of jokes in each category. Here are some samples. Human. Computer repairman to executive: "Did you ever think of showing it some love?" Antihuman. Ancient Chinese to assistant. "So sorry you've been replaced by an abacus." Superhuman. Man grinning happily, reads computer card: SHE DOES. Subhuman. Puzzled-looking man in front of computer: "All that comes out is a ball of gum." Dempsey writes that the "foregoing jokes, if they are funny, are funny because they don't arouse too much fear or too much anger." His conclusion is consistent with that of Duncan, Piddington and Eastman. It is interesting to note the similarity and con- flict between Dempsey's categories and John W. Campbell's famous Three Laws of Robotics: (1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through in- action allow a human being to come to harm, (2) a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, and (3) a robot must protect its own existence. The Three Laws appeared first in a story by Issac Azimov and are now standard guidelines for science fiction. The gags mentioned by Dempsey do not seem to hold today's machine in such a humani- tarian light. However, the thread of conflict is evi- dent, and the Subhuman and Human gags seem to parallel the thinking of science fiction writers about the greatest conflict in our culture- the anthropom- orphic machine and the mechanized human. Humor in instructional communications How have the designers of communication tech- nology utilized humor as a form of communication? Humor massages us daily. More than 60 million Americans read the comic sections of newspapers. Spiegelman's study classified 81% of the strips as humorous. Humor is used to transmit messages that sell millions of dollars worth of products an- nually. The recent trend in television advertising of more humor is significant: Producers of commercial messages have gotten the message that humor sells products. Don Harold has even written a book called Humor in Advertising. Does humor enhance communication? Or, more specifically, does humor enhance the transmission of a message in the instructional process? The answer from empirical research is uncertain and conflicting. Much of the research on this question has been conducted with adults in military training. Humorous special effects have been unsuccessful in some in- structional films. However, Lumsdaine reported in Training Research and Education that little or no experimental research has been made with animated cartoons. None of the research reviewed by Lumsdaine (1962, 1963) and Travers (1967) attempted to test a theory of humor in communication through the use of instructional media. All of the studies focused on the use of humor as a motivational device to enhance learning. Humor as an attention-getter or motivational technique had no significant effect on learning from military training films when such humor was created by special effects, e.g., reversing or speeding up the action. However, Cook's (1960) review of research re- vealed the opposite: Humor had a significant effect on learning when cartoons were the source of the humor. In one study cartoons which emphasized certain features of depicted objects were effective in calling attention to relevant cues. Cartoons were 12 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY / March 30, 1968</page><page sequence="5">superior to photographs, shaded drawings and draw- ings in that order when teaching the positioning of objects. A second study found that cartoons were effective in teaching aircraft identification. It is interesting to note that in one regard motivational devices and humor are related in function. The motivational device aimed at develop- ing a level of anxiety has an effect similar to the ludicrous situation, which also arouses anxiety. The anxiety stimulated by both motivational techniques and the ludicrous situation lead to a drive to reduce the unpleasantness. In humor, the anxiety caused by the subversive ludicrous situation is reduced by a response of laughter. Anxiety aroused by a motivational tech- nique is reduced by a drive to learn to avoid the unpleasant source of anxiety - at least in theory. Perhaps the Feshback and Janis (1951) study classically illustrated how the principle of conflict resolution can work against the media designer. Children who viewed a particularly gory version of a dental hygiene film reduced their anxiety by rapidly learning- learning not to pay attention to the content at all and not to think about their teeth! Lumsdaine (1963) suggested that humor or other motivational devices in media would be more effec- tive if (a) there were a specific need for such general interest-getting functions, (b) the technique directed attention to relevant cues related to the learning task, and (c) such techniques were designed to function as mnemonics to associate cue and re- quired response. Summary In summary, it is clear that the research on cartoons in media generally supports a conclusion that humor enhances transmission of specific mes- sages (Cook 1960). However, the embellishment of films with special effects such as reversing action, increased speed, etc. to create humor has generally been unsuccessful (Travers 1967 and Lumsdaine 1962, 1963). Jacob Getzels (1967) has posited that experi- mental research has influenced educational prac- tice to a much greater extent than the 70,000 odd empirical researches of the past three decades. Ex- perimental research tests theory and builds a foundation for conceptualizing about the learner; empirical research does not. Apparently, more experimental research, which would test the inferences drawn by Piddington and others, is needed before conceptualizations about humor can be established» that will lead to applica- tion in instructional communications. The empirical researches reviewed by Travers, Lumsdaine and Cook have not provided a clear rationale for utilizing humor in instruction. □ REFERENCES Cook, John.
